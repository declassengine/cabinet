DOCUMENTTHE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGKWERNMElS^ 3SECRETCP... (k10)  2218TH NOVEMBER,  19U9COPY NOTO. 3 1CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilEvents of the past few months have underlined, thefact that in present circumstances the burden of a SocialistChancellor of the Exchequer has become exceedingly heavy. .He is responsible for the Budget, for the control of public expenditure and for the entire co-ordination of our economicand financial policies at home and abroad.    In addition he isin effect the supreme currency manager for a group of countries spread across the continents and responsible for alarge part of the world&apos;s trade.   In this last capacity he ha no authority beyond his own persuasive powers and in negotiating with the much stronger and more prosperous dollarworld he has not even the backing of a decent minimum reserve of gold and foreign exchange.2. His lack of elbow-room in foreign negotiations is almost matched by his lack of elbow-room at home.Circumstances have conspired to drive public expenditure,most of it desirable on merits, up to levels demandingtaxation fully as high, as can be borne if revenue is to bemaintained and savings encouraged.    Thus there is littlemargin for readjustments,  hoy/ever necessary, and the whole structure of public finance tends to grow rigid.   Unless wecan relax this pressure,  everything else we have done andplan still to do will be imperilled.    It is, of course, an obvious duty of all of us who are responsible for the spending of public monoy to regard ourselves as ministers for Economy as much as for our own Departmental concerns.By trying to look at our own Estimates with a Treasury eyebefore allowing them to go forward we can do much to assistand relieve the Chancellor,  and to help toeciuilibritira.restore financialauthor it:l&apos;he statement which I made with the concurrence andof the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theexchequer in the debate on the economic situation on27th October, that there would bo &quot;a thorough comb-out oeveservice and every Department as the Estimates for thenext financial year come forwardw;well received by theHouse, and we can be confident that the more public evidencev-e can give in the next few months of action on these lines,ouejugoer our standing as a Government will be.

5. In addition, I would(a) All Chairmen of (Official)Coi.iraittees, Departmental, andInt e r depar tmental,  s hourci*tr?rT3p&apos;ec if i cally ins t rue &quot;ced to To okout for and to call&quot; special attention to opportunities for economy which emerge in the course of their work.    It sometimeshappens that coi/itfiittees charged with some wide or specific objectrun&quot;across instances where significant savings could beobtained but do not follow them up as the matter is outside  ^their particular terms of reference.    I propose that all yOffioiaj^)committees should be instructed to regard suggestions for,   economy as within their terms of reference in future, andshould be told to include in their reports recommendations-s    for saving public expenditure.   Apart from its yield in detailedsavings such an instruction, would help in securing the rightatmosphere in all Departments.(b) Economy by local authorities is just as important aseconomy by Departments and may well offer even greater scope.I suggest that, when the Report on Local Government Man-power is received, the Prime Minister might consider inviting leadingrepresentatives of local authorities along to No. 10 downing street to impress on them the need for drastic retrenchment andto invite their suggestions on methods by which their relationswith central government might be mo re economically conducted by adjustments on both sides.    The wide differences in thecost of provision of similar services, such as school -olacesand housing, by different local authorities might also&quot;be furtherventilated.S p e c i a 1 I ny e s t i ga t i on s6. I do not think,  however,  that we should under-estimate the obstacles in the way of securing a more economicaladministration.   Many of the drastic methods resorted to inthe past have undoubtedly been brought about by a sense of thevast mass of vested interest,  complacency and inertia thathas to be overcome.    From this point of view,  specialinvestigations a.re of great value.    The Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with me,  set up last year a committee under the Chairmanship of sir Henry French on the Cost of HomeInformation Services which made a thorough review, with thewilling support of the Central Office of Information and ofinformation officers in Departments, and has been instrumentalin stimulating substantial savings without serious detriment to this important branch of cover rim en t.   As the minister responsible to the Cabinet for information policy generally,I welcomed and,  indeed sought, that independent criticalinvestigation.    This technique seems to be particularly called for in the services which were swollen under war-time conditions and which have never been brought back to anything like their peace-time oise.   The Debate also raised the question whetheradministrative economies might not be achieved by merging certainDepartments.   Enquiries into such matters, if well run and.sufficiently independent, can liven up a  minis tra t ion and produce greater efficiency at less cost.7. My specific proposal under this head is that theChancellor of the Exchequer should, be invited to bring beforethe Economic Policy Committee a list of Departments and problems which merit high-level investigation with a view to more economical administration, with suggestions how they should becarried out.Levels of Expenditure3- When all these things have been done,  however,   there remains a more fundamental problem to which either the cabinet or the Economic Policy Committee should devote aorno attention.

We are embarking upon growing expenditure without an adequatereview of where it is leading to or whether the total billcan be afforded.    In considering desirable schemes, we haverarely applied out minds to the question whether we could afford the total bill for all these schemes, with the additionsand refinements which later administration introduces.9, This is a general criticism of us as a Government put it is also true that, in respect of many services, recentlegislation has lessened the effectiveness of financial control.    The Chancellor of the Hxchequer, in a recentdiscussion of the National Health Service,  referred to the unsatisfactory character of the financial relations betweenthe Health Departments and the Regional Hospital Boards(C.M.(&apos;-!-9) 37th Conclusions, Minute 1).    In other fields, notablyeducation, Government Departments are now by statute requiredto initiate and promote developments, whereas previously theytended on occasion to act as a brake upon action by the localauthorities,  on whom rested the primary responsibility for development.    This throws a burden of check and control on theTreasury which I do not believe it can reasonably be expectedto bear.    The crop of supplemantaries with which we are threatened is not an accident of this year - it is symptomaticof the weakness of present methods of financial and policycontrol.10. What is the remedy?    One method would be to plan the size of Government expenditure for several years ahead.I recognise the dangers of this method, if drastic curtail-ment should become necessary;    but the present danger is thatpolicies will be entered into which involve a continuousgrowth of Government expenditure.   Ministers ought, to a greater extent than is at present the case, to be forced to considerwhich of several desirable projects they will adopt within thelimits of a specific sum devoted to the services for which&quot;they are responsible.    The Minister of Defence and the service ministers, with the aid of the Chiefs of Staff, are engagedin a comprehensive review of the size and shape of the armed forces in 1950-53,  with special reference to their cost.    I donot wish to be taken as satisfied with the present state ofthis review, but I think, the method is valuable and might beapplied elsewhere.    Is it not time for an enquiry on theDefence model into the size and shape of the Social services in 1950-53?I1&apos; I would also suggest that the Chancellor of theExchequer should be invited to arrange for regular reports tobe furnished, to Ministers on progress with other economic measures now in train.    I have particularly in mind, the follow-up of the^Washington conversations of last September, the drive to increase dollar exports, and the production drive andits accompanying publicity measures.    In all these matters,  timeP r e n s e s .12. In my paper of 21st July on the economic situation(O.P.O4.9) 159) I asked whether the Economic Policy committee or- some now committee of Ministers ought not to considerv/hat changes should be made in the machinery for controllingexpenditure and for ensuring that measures loading^ to increased spending received prior Government sanction.   Theabove suggestions &quot;are examples of the type of action by theGovernment which might assist in strengthening the chancellors hand and in enabling him to restore a more securebalance between the revenue and. the ever-insistent demands for public expenditure.H.M.
