v. /THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1949 y.---1 SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 24226th November, 1949CABINETINDONESIA: ARMS EMBARGOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that an embargo on the supply of military equip-ment and training facilities to the Netherlands Government was imposed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in accordance with a statement which I made to theCabinet on 26th June, 1947 (CM. (47) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The embargo was partially raised on 31st August, 1948, in consequenceof improved conditions in Indonesia, but when the Dutch undertook their secondpolice action it was tightened up again, as I informed the Cabinet on22nd December, 1948 (CM. (48) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 1).3. Under the terms of the recent agreement reached at The Hague, theNetherlands Government have agreed to withdraw their forces from Indonesia.This withdrawal has already begun.4. The Netherlands Foreign Minister mentioned the question of the arms&quot;embargo to me recently in Paris and I promised to look into it. The NetherlandsEmbassy in London have also raised the matter. I do not consider it eithernecessary or desirable that a formal statement should be made to the effect thatthe embargo has been discontinued, and I would suggest that all that is necessaryis a cessation of the practice of asking the Netherlands Government for an assurance -that any particular consignment of war materials is not destined foruse in Indonesia.5.   I accordingly invite the concurrence of my colleagues in : (a) an informal intimation from the Foreign Office to the NetherlandsEmbassy in London that we propose to terminate the practice of seeking assurances about the destination of arms ordered by theNetherlands authorities; and(b) arranging with the Netherlands authorities that no publicity will begiven to the raising of the embargo.E. B.31Foreign Office, S. W. 1,26th November, 1949.37937
