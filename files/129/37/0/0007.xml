II I       f    T       |jf     40 II ftlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI8 BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S QOYBRKMEMTI SECRETl lI THE UNITED KINGDOM IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA ANDTHE FAR EASTIn considering our policy in South-East Asia and the Far East, it is first ofI all necessary to decide whether the political and economic influence of the UnitedI Kingdom in that part of the world is-(a) an important factor in the preservation of world peace; and(b) of direct benefit to the United Kingdom.2. The United Kingdom has a particular position in Asia which is notI enjoyed by other Western Powers; unless this position of advantage is used toI bring about closer collaboration between East and West, there is a very realI danger that the whole of Asia will become the servant of the Kremlin. TheI influence of the United Kingdom in South-East Asia and the Far East is thereforeI an important factor in the preservation of world peace.3. The benefit to the United Kingdom of its relationship with South-EastI Asia and the Far East has not yet been measured in terms. Economically we areI dependent upon the area for items such as rubber, tea and jute. The dollar poolI of the sterling area derives very substantial earnings from Malaya.   It isB|l probable that, if the standard of living of the peoples of Asia can be improved,I trading potentialities will vastly increase. More than half the population ofI the world lives in the area; its resources are by no means fully developed, and inI 1 the short term it will probably produce a dividend more quickly than the continentI of Africa. What Asia has in labour it lacks in skill; a combination of WesternI technology and Eastern man-power might be welded into a formidable partnership.The New Asia4. Nationalism is rampant to-day from Afghanistan to the China Sea;I only in Japan is it dormant under American occupation. In Asia, which hasI lingered benind Europe in the development of nationhood, it is not surprisingI that nationalism is regarded as something to be fostered and encouraged. But,I whereas intense nationalism is considered by Asiatic races to be both necessaryI and desirable to achieve national solidarity in newly created States, it is liableI I to lead to friction in international relationships. South-East Asia and the FarI East are new in the sense that nationhood has only recently impinged upon theI local consciousness. We are faced, therefore, with an intense nationalism whichI is prickly in its international relationships. Though the idea of pan-Asia,I sponsored originally by the Japanese, creates the danger of a cleavage betweenI East and West, there is, in fact, little or no cohesion between Asiatic countries,I and it is probably true to say that there is greater fear, distrust and even dislikeI between Asiatic neighbours than there is between Asiatic and Western nations.I Nevertheless, Asiatic nationalism is abnormally sensitive to anything whichI savours of Western domination or dictation. Since domination came from theI I West, there is still a tendency to regard the West with suspicion. DominationKH by Russia, on the other hand, is something of which South Asia is unconscious;I it has yet little meaning or reality. To this extent Russia enjoys a certain advan-I tage over the Western Powers.5. It is unfortunate that the countries of South-East Asia and the Far EastI should be passing through this stage of their development at a time when theI Soviet Union is seeking to obtain domination over the whole Eurasian continent. ^^^HI The political immaturity of these countries and their economic distress render &apos;I them particularly susceptible to Communist tactics : of this China presents anIh almost classic example.  It is doubtful whether even Communist China will be\WW able or will attempt to extend direct political control over the area. .The existence ^^^HI of large Chinese communities in the countries of South-East Asia, however, ^^^flI presents dangerous possibilities for disruption from within, since all these Chinese ^^^HI must be regarded as potential agents of their Government whatever its political
complexion.  On the other hand, the unpopularity of the Chinese settlers withthe local inhabitants may be considered to be a factor which will encourageresistance to the spread of Communist doctrines propagated from China. Again,India may one day se,ek to dominate the area politically, but there are few signsat present of the South-East Asian countries willingly accepting a lead from the I^^HIndians, who are unpopular and whose expansionist aims are feared. It is, there- ^^^Hfore, fair to say that from the Persian Gulf to the China Sea there is no singlePower capable of dominating the region nor any combination of Powers which Iby its united strength could successfully resist Russian expansion.  Nor is thereat present any one Asiatic Power capable of bringing about unity and co-operationthroughout the region.   The dangers of the situation are thus manifest andmanifold.United Kingdom Influence(a) Political6. The United Kingdom cannot dominate the region, but we can and shoulduse our political and economic influence to weld the area into some degree ofregional co-operation. Politically, the chief advantage to our position is that wehave been the most successful of the Western Powers in coming to terms withthe new Nationalist spirit in Asia. Of our former possessions, India, Pakistan Iand Ceylon are now independent members of the Commonwealth, and Burma,though outside the Commonwealth, is friendly. The political systems of all thesecountries are built upon a British foundation. The Dutch and French, on theother hand, are still in conflict with the Nationalist movements in Indonesia and IIndo-China. Moreover, the United Kingdom enjoys the prestige of victory inthe Second World War, moderated, it must be admitted, by the memory of ourdefeats at the hands of the Japanese; whereas the French and Dutch are regardedby Eastern opinion merely as liberated nations.(b) Economic7. Our economic influence is also considerable. Up-to-date figures arelacking, but before the war we were the largest foreign investors in Asia and ourholdings are still very substantial. The value of our trade with South-East Asiaand the Far East is second only to that of the United States, our main suppliesto the area being manufactured goods. We have a particularly close relationshipwith those parts of South-East Asia which fall within the sterling area; Malayais of particular importance, not only as a source of vital raw materials, rubberand tin, but as a major dollar earner. The oil-fields of Borneo and Sarawak,whose output is growing rapidly and is now the largest in British or Common-wealth territory, may well become a major dollar saver. The jute supplies of Indiaand Pakistan are vital not only to our own jute industries but to the supplyingof agricultural commodities within the sterling area. Manganese supplies fromIndia are an important alternative to those from the Gold Coast, and wolframand chrome from Burma are important elements in the manufacture of steel alloys. IThe United Kingdom has bought the whole copra supply of Ceylon for the currentperiod, and virtually all the tea in the world comes from Asia.The Position of the United States8. The other great Western Power, the United States, has the greatest Ivolume of trade with the Far East and South-East Asia, but does not enjoy the Isame degree of prestige as the United Kingdom, partly because it lacks the Ihistorical connections which we enjoy with the area, partly because of the failure Iof its policy in China, and partly because of its reluctance to play a leading part Iin South-East Asia. The Americans are concentrating at present on the creation Hof a friendly and democratic Japan, in which country they enjoy a dominant Iposition. But, although the United States Government is in general sympathetic Iwith Nationalist movements in Asia as long as they are free from Communist I^^^b domination, the laissez-faire American economic philosophy has little appeal in IAsia, where practically all progressive thought is Socialist.   It is not a great Bexaggeration to say that, when Asiatic Nationalists consider the future politicaland economic structure of their independent countries, they contemplate only the^^H| alternatives of democratic Socialism and Communism, which they sometimes^^^b simplify into a choice between the British and Russian ways of life.
I                                        41 IThe Future Development of South-East Asia and. the Far East9. There is a general desire, much, handicapped by lack of expert knowledge,I among the Nationalist Governments of the new Asia to push through as soon asI possible programmes of economic development with the main emphasis onI industrialisation. At present many of the essential capital goods are availableI only in the United States, but as our production expands we should be able toI assist increasingly in meeting these needs, particularly since most Asiatic countriesI have more sterling than dollars at their disposal.  Our exports of capital goods j^^HI to the area are already substantial.   These facts place the United Kingdom in ^^^1I a favourable position for helping to plan and co-ordinate economic development H^HI in South-East Asia.&apos; But, before much progress can be made, it will be necessary ^^^1I to establish more clearly than has hitherto been done the development requirements |^^HI and potentialities of the countries concerned.   At present development pro- ^^^HI grammes of countries like Burma are quite unrealistic through lack of experience ^^^HI and technical knowledge.  It is clear that the full development of the area canI only be brought about with United States assistance, but at present there is an ^^^1obvious reluctance on the part of the Americans to risk a further loss after their ^^^1experience in China.   It is, therefore, all the more important that we should ^^^Hgive a lead and, by proving the fitness of South-East Asia and the Far East for ^^^1consideration as an area capable of profitable development, encourage the ^^^1Americans to supplement our efforts. fl^^l10. The economic influence which we derive from our capital investments ^^^H| in the area is, of course, a mixed blessing, since it is associated with our former l^^^limperialist position and arouses the suspicion of Nationalists, who see in it a fl^^l| method of indirect British control. The leaders of some of the new Asiatic States H^HI are not blind to the advantages to be derived from foreign capital if it is properly ^^^Hcontrolled, and the Premiers of India and Burma have both made encouraging ^^^1statements on this point.   There is, however, much doubt and suspicion in the ^^^Hpress and public opinion of the new Asia as to the legitimate role, if any, of ^^^Hforeign enterprise in an independent Socialist State, which it is very important H^^lthat we should strive to dispel. H^^HThe Bole of the United Kingdom ^^^H11. Our interests and commitments in Asia, as can be seen from the above; 9^^lare greater and more varied than those of any other Western Power. The question S^^lIarises whether they are not in excess of our post-war strength. We have, however, ^^^Halready substantially reduced our political and military commitments in the ^^^HIndian sub-continent and Burma since the war, and our economic ties are too ^^^Hvaluable to us to be severed without serious consequences.  In war we could not H^^lafford military commitments of a size which would enable us to offer effective fl^^Hresistance against a full-scale attack. Such military commitments as we can afford ^^^Hin peace should be for the purpose of maintaining internal security within our l^^^lown territories, encouraging confidence in the adolescent nations of the region, j^^^Hand supporting local efforts to place defence establishments on a sound footing. ^^^HIn the long run it will be for the Asian countries themselves to preserve their ^^^Bnational integrity and, given guidance on the right lines, there is no reason why, ^^^Hin the event of a world conflict, they should not be able to offer effective resistance ^^^Hto any possible aggression from Russia, whose major commitments will most ^^^Hprobably lie in the West and the Middle East. |^^^fl12. We must accept the fact that there are also positive disadvantages in ^^^Hthe United Kingdom position in Asia. Our imperialist past is by no means ^^^Hforgotten; the suspicion lurks all top frequently that we are seeking by more subtle ^^^Hmeans to re-establish our domination, and this suspicion is exploited by our ^^^Henemies. In the areas overrun by the Japanese in the war, the recollection has j^^^Hnot yet faded of our early and ignominious defeat. The fact that we were on the ^^^Hwinning side in the end does not obliterate the thought that an Asiatic Power ^^^Hwas demonstrably able to inflict crushing military defeats upon us. As a result ^^^Hour actions to-day are regarded more critically and with less confidence than ^^^Hbefore the war. ^^^H13. Certainly the advantages which the United Kingdom enjoys outweigh ^^^Hthe disadvantages. Equally there is no other Power capable of undertaking the ^^^1formidable task of trying to link South-East Asia with the West and to create ^^^Hb
?fl ???HAH some kind of regional association which will be capable of effective resistance ^bb||AVAA against communism and Russian expansion.   If we fail, the threat to WesternHHA preponderance will be serious; if we succeed, there will be undoubted benefit to WHIHHA the United Kingdom and to the association of Western Powers. ~HHAConclusion AVJ14.   The conclusion is that the influence of the United Kingdom in South- jHHJAVAV| East Asia and the Far East is an important factor in the preservation of world jHHApeace and of direct benefit to the United Kingdom itself.   We are led to the jAVAJ?AVAj further conclusions that the aim of the United Kingdom should be to build up *AHsome sort of regional association in South-East Asia in partnership with the HHJHHfl association of the Atlantic Powers.   Not only are we in the best position to HHAHHfl interest the United States in active participation in maintaining the stability AVAflHHfl of the area, but our relation with the Commonwealth provides a means of AmbI?AVAj influencing and co-ordinating the policies not only of the Asiatic Dominions, but HHA^^^Aj of Australia and New Zealand, whose strategic interest in the area is, in fact,^^^Aj equal to our own.   The immediate object of a wider association of the West, HHA^^^A including the Pacific members of the Commonwealth and the South-East Asian ,^^H^^^H countries, would be to prevent the spread of communism and to resist Russian HHJ?AAAJ expansion : its long-term object would be to create a system of friendly partner- bAH^^^H ship between East and West and to improve economic and social conditions in^^^b South-East Asia and the Far East.  The difficulties to be overcome, the methods-whereby these objects may be attained and the particular problems of individual^^^Aj countries, whether in the area or with interests involved, will be discussed in theHHA second part of this paper. H aHIREGIONAL CO-OPERATION IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA AND THE .HFAR EAST*South-East Asia^^^M General ConsiderationsAa^AA (a) Asian NationalismB^AVA 15.   The whole relationship between the Asian countries and the West has HBAB^AVA been bedevilled by the historical legacy from the struggle between emergingB^AVA nationalism and the European colonial Powers.  At the end of the war Britain HBIBB^BA was faced with three possible courses of action:   to maintain her political     BB BABJBB^BA domination of countries in South-East Asia by force; to abandon her entireBB^Afl position in the area; or to come to an amicable settlement whereby both nationalBB^AB aspirations and British interests and influence were safeguarded.   We choseBB^Bfl the last of these courses, and our policy in India, Pakistan, Ceylon and BurmaBB^BB has, in the event, proved to have been one of the major factors in ensuring that BBBJB^BBA the countries of South-East Asia, if not yet actual allies in the struggle against^^^H &quot;Soviet Communism, are at least looking to the West for support rather than toBHBB Russia. AHH^^^H 16.   The French and the Dutch have been slower to appreciate the inevitable AHBHB^BJ march of events in Asia, and for a time there was a danger that, not only wouldBBMJ they drive the nationalist elements in the areas they controlled into the arms of^^^H the Communists, but that they might discredit the West with all Asian nationalB^BBB movements-a discredit in which Great Britain, despite her own more generous HBIBB^BBJ * Japan, Korea and China are. for the purpose of this section, taken to be the countries      H B^BBBB^BBJ comprising the Far East. The first two remain for the present primarily an American commitment. H^BflBSflBBJ while the third must be regarded not as a potential candidate for inclusion in any regional arrange- BBBJAABBB ment. but as a potentially hostile Power whose existence makes greater regional solidarity necessary. BBBJBSflSB The Far Eastern area, therefore, is of subsidiary importance in any examination of the problem of BAHBB^BBJ how United Kingdom policies may best bring about greater unity in Asia.   South-East Asia, on ?ViHbVJBB^BBJ the other hand, is an area in which the United Kingdom is already vitally involved and where her BABIAB^BBJ influence can best be brought to bear both directly and through the Commonwealth connections. BBBJHAABfl It is therefore in South-East Asia that the United Kingdom must begin with any attempt to promote BBBJAB^BBJ great regional collaboration, and only later can the Far East become attached to any system whichBSVSB may BSfll
I 42 mpolicy, would share* Fortunately, the signs are now more hopeful that a friendly^^fl        settlement in Indonesia and Indo-China is in sight.   When amicable relationshave been established, the invidious choice that Britain had to make between her VSjWestern allies on the one hand and her potential Asian friends on the other willI        have been removed, and our own standing and that of the West as a whole^ with IIndia in particular, greatly improved. Suspicion of the West and of imperialism,B-VJ        however, dies hard and only time and the most careful handling of AsianB-VJ        susceptibilities will bring about a fully satisfactory relationship between East B-JJand West. With the Asian nations much can be done (or undone) through personal PAJrelationships at all levels.   It is therefore of vital importance that the right VMVJpersonnel snould be employed for our dealings in Asia and particularly in India^^fl        and Pakistan.(b) Inter-Asian Relations17.   The new-found freedom of the Asian countries and the danger that thisfreedom may yet be lost to Moscow&apos;s dictatorship have not, however, served toabolish conflict between the countries themselves. The Afghan-Pakistan dispute,Awj        Indo-Pakistan bitterness arising from partition and the question of Kashmir, the AwJBwj        chaotic state of Burma and the fears which this arouses in her neighbours, thecomparative isolationism of Siam and the disturbed state of Indo-China and B-VJIndonesia are all factors contributing to the general lack of co-operation in the B9jarea.  Again, India is (apart from Communist China) the only country physicallycapable of acting as a leader to South-East Asia, but the Asian countries appearto fear and mistrust domination by one of their own number as much as they dis-liked European domination.   Any direct attempt by India to act as the sole co-ordinator in any regional system would therefore not prove welcome to the othercountries involved, and in particular to Pakistan who still fears that India&apos;s aimis to bring about the re-union of the sub-continent by force or threat of force.   It BVBB-VJ        is therefore clear that conditions do not at present exist in which the AsianB-VJ        countries are likely to combine of their own accord, without a lead from elsewhere.I  (c) The United StatesB-VJ 18.   No final regional system of collaboration can, in the long run, hope toexist without American participation. Unfortunately the Americans appear toB-VJ be holding aloof from South-East Asia problems at the present time. It appearsB-B that after their failure in China they are content to let us develop plans forBBJ regional co-operation and will wait to see if they work in practice before offering toassist or participate in them.   Whereas in the Middle East the Americans have PABJBVJ        told us they are prepared to help us to maintain our position, provided we our- ^^^P|selves are determined to do our utmost to maintain it, in South-East Asia onlythe success of our efforts is likely to encourage the Americans to come in with us atsome later stage.   In Japan and South Korea the United States already have acommitment, and they will certainly maintain some line of strategic defence in the B&amp;BjBBJ Pacific._ByJ Particular Factors BVJ(a) India ^^^M19.   India is the key to the whole problem of South-East Asian regional co- BSHBBJ     I operation.   Without India we can achieve little, but India is at present in no ^^^HI mood to co-operate in any joint move to establish an anti-Communist front in BBBBBJ     I South-East Asia and the Far East.   Her attitude can be summed up as :- B&amp;BjHBJ (1) A mistrust of the West based on the legacy of imperialism. *B*B(2) A fear that she may be embroiled by the West in a struggle with Russia,B-VJ and hence an avowed desire to remain clear of entanglements with B&gt;Af|either of the Great Power blocs.   Subsidiary to this is the fear that ABBBWl &apos;  11 we may exploit the Commonwealth relationship to draw her imper- BABlB-VJ ceptibly into our own policies. BvMf|(3) A belief, based on a failure to realise that the Soviet Communist threat BBBis world wide and not directed solely against the West, that it is, in B-By.^Hi|                  fact, possible to sit on the fence.   This leads to a disinclination toB-VJ                      believe that the Chinese Communists are willing to follow direction BVMVfrom Moscow, or that a Communist China may threaten Asian National BBBB-VJ                       Governments, i-??.; ^^^B^Bb             (4) A belief in India&apos;s destiny as the leader of the Asian peoples. ^^^B
^^^H 20.   The Indian attitude in (1) to (3) above can be said to be representative I^^^H to a greater or less degree of the attitude of all South-East Asian countries.^^^H Therefore, taking these factors into account it must be assumed that any general I_^^H policy towards South-East Asia and the Ear East must-^^^H (1) strive to dissolve the suspicions directed against our colonial policy;^^^H (2) convince all the nations of South-East Asia that any position between I^^^H the two Great Power blocs is illusory and persuade them that the front I^^^H against Communism, which the West is building up, is as much in their 11^^^H interest as in that of Europe, and that they are not merely regarded^^^H as auxiliaries to be used in any conflict that may come about;^^HH (3) in regard to India, induce a realisation that while we view her aspirations^H^| with sympathy, time is short and unless she is prepared to play a more I 11^^^H positive role, there may be no Asia left for her to lead.^^^^1 While something can be done on these lines in the political field, concrete help ofa technical, financial and economic nature is likely to be of the greatest influence^^^^H in achieving the first two points of policy mentioned above.   This aspect will beexamined later in the paper.   Further &quot;there are signs that Communist expansion,^^^H just as it served to bring about the greater cohesion of the West, is bringing the_^^^H leaders of the countries of Asia to a more realistic frame of mind with regard to K^H^^^H regional co-operation in the face of the common danger.  Unless the Communists Wm^^^H are very much more skilful than in the past, their future actions and successes are^^^^1 likely to accelerate this process.(b) The Commonwealth and South-East Asia^^^^h 21.   The defence of South-East Asia is of vital concern to Australia and^^^^1 New Zealand.   In addition, three other fully independent members of theCommonwealth (India, Pakistan and Ceylon), the economically important colonies^^^H of Malaya and Hong Kong, and Burma in special treaty relationship with our-^^^H selves, all lie in the area under consideration.  Thus seven out of the nine fully -_^^^H independent Commonwealth countries are directly interested in safeguarding H K^H^^^H against Communist inroads the defence of a line stretching from Afghanistan to^^^H the China Sea, while Burma has recently looked to the Commonwealth for help in^^^H her military and financial crisis.   There is therefore a nucleus upon which to build K^Hany system of regional co-operation.   Two immediate obstacles must, however,^^^H first be overcome before any practical steps are taken to build on this nucleus-the^^^H Kashmir dispute and India&apos;s fear that the regional strength of South-East Asia^^^H is to be exploited for the sake of a war in the West between the Western Powers^^^H and Russia. Other dangers are the racial policies of South Africa and Australia. HThe present South African Government&apos;s attitude is provocative of anti-European^^^H sentiment, and her membership of the Commonwealth tends to involve us in an I^^^H accusation of &quot; Colonialism.&quot;   Despite Australia&apos;s professions of sympathy for^^^H the struggling nationalisms in Asia there has been evidence recently that the^^^M execution of the &quot; White Australia &quot; policy has begun to cause resentment in^^^H Asiatic countries, and there is a danger that this policy may ultimately embitter^^^H relations between Australia and Asia.^^^H 22.   Having agreed that it is for Great Britain to play a major (if Hunobtrusive) part in organising South-East Asia for regional political, economicand military co-operation, there is much to be said for using a Commonwealth^^^H rather than a purely United Kingdom approach to achieve our aims. Not only will^^^^h India be less suspicious that she is being used as a pawn in a European-Moscow ?^^^^1 chess match, but her aspirations to be a leading member of the team can largely be Hsatisfied without-^^^^H (a) causing undue offence to Pakistan and Ceylon (since the United Kingdom, H^^H^^^H Australia and New Zealand will all be playing too);^^^H (b) frightening other countries in the area that Asian Regional Collaboration^^^^a is not another name for Greater India or Mahabharat.^^^H 23.   The- suggestion to hold a Commonwealth Conference in Ceylon in 1950 Hremains at the moment in abeyance.  If such a Conference can be held it should^^^H provide a suitable occasion for a discussion on South-East Asian affairs. Though^^HH the presence of South Africa at the Conference may encourage India to expound I^^^H her views on racial questions, it is unlikely that South Africa will wish to
I intervene on questions which are concerned only with South-East Asia. There isI therefore no reason why a satisfactory understanding should not be reached onI the latter. Further Communist success an China, increasing Communist dis-I turbances in India and a successful launching of independent regimes in IndonesiaI and Indo-China, may do much in the meantime to bring India to the ConferenceI table in a realistic frame of mind.I (c) Pakistan24. In the event of a world war Pakistan would represent a secure baseI from which immediate retaliatory air action could be taken against certainI important Soviet industrial centres in Central Asia.   Economically Pakistan is? self-sufficient in food supplies and should eventually become a surplus area withI the development of hydro-electric schemes at present -planned.   At the momentI Pakistan is smarting from what she considers Commonwealth &quot;favouritism&quot;I towards India, and until the Kashmir dispute is settled her relations with theI United Kingdom and the West are liable to be vitiated by waves of emotionalism.I It must therefore be a major point in our policy to bring about as soon as possibleI a complete and equitable settlement between India and Pakistan.   Even whenI normal relations are achieved, however, it is doubtful whether Pakistan, in viewI of her fears of India mentioned in pargaraph 17, would willingly enter anyregional scheme in which India was oast for the leading role.   Present badrelations with Afghanistan are a danger in a potentially strategic area, and ifi I allowed to continue would probably cause Afghanistan to remain aloof from any ^^^mregional scheme.   The formation of a common front against Communism by theI &apos;Jlpddle East countries would undoubtedly have an effect in encouraging PakistanI to follow an anti-Communist line.I (d) Afghanistan ^^^fl25. Apart from the quarrel with Pakistan over the frontier areas,I Afghanistan, despite a real and persistent hostility to Russia, would be unlikelyto enter any regional scheme without very strong guarantees, in view of herm exposed northern boundary with the Soviet Union. Difficulties of communication\ Muthward would probably rule out any attempt to come to Afghanistan&apos;s aid inthe event of war. Afghanistan is in urgent need of economic assistance and anyregional system giving mutual economic aid would be welcome to her and wouldnot necessarily face her with a strong Russian reaction.(e) Burma ^^^H26. Since achieving independence in January 1948, the Burmese Govern-1   ment has been beset by a series of armed insurrections, and there are now at leastH  five distinct groups in revolt, of which the two best organised and most purposeful ^^^Hare the Karens, and the White Flag Communists.  Despite their difficulties, thepresent &apos;&apos; caretaker &apos;&apos; Government, headed by Premier Thakin Nu, represent ^^^Hthe most stable and experienced elements in Burma and the best-disposed towardsco-operation with Britain and the West.  They have also managed to maintain ^^^Htheir rice exports at about one-third of pre-war exports, a fact which has helped ^^^HMalaya, India and Ceylon.  We have, therefore, jointly with India, Pakistan, ^^^HJ I   and Ceylon embarked this year on a policy of aiding the present Burmese Govern- ^^^HmenE with arms and military equipment.   We have also undertaken to discuss ^^^Hshort-term financial aid. ^^^H27. The situation in Burma is thoroughly unstable and the importantBurmese Socialist party, which has a majority in the Burmese Parliament, is ^^^Hcertainly flirting with Communism. There are, however, some hopes of inducing ^^^Hthe present Government to concentrate its energies on suppressing its Communist ^^^H|       and extreme Left-Wing enemies and to accept the value of the role which British ^^^Hinterests can play in the Burmese economy. Burma is also a useful field for the ^^^Hexercise of a policy of Commonwealth co-operation, and success here would create ^^^Han encouraging precedent for a joint approach to other South-East Asian ^^^H28. Unlike her neighbours Siam is prosperous and peaceful, and the ^^^HI      governing classes are well aware of the danger of Communist expansion.   But ^^^Hthis expansion is identified largely with Chinese expansionism.   Unfortunately ^^^H
HIM . the Siamese are not so obsessed by the threat from China and from the largeH Chinese minority in Siam that they feel obliged to dispense with dissensions HI amongst themselves.   As a result the personal rivalry between Marshal Pibul and   I paVHHH the fugitive Pridi, the spasmodic violence of &quot; Free Siamese &quot; opposition to ^^flftyBS the present regime and the long-standing enmity between the Army and the Navy    I *BJ^^^1 may well give the Communists and/or the Chinese the looked-for opportunity F?VMS of weakening and disrupting Siam. HHI?VMS 29.   The Siamese fear domination by other Asian peoples rather than BHj^^^H domination by Western Powers. Moreover they look to Britain and the United IVSHJ States as sources of military and economic supply and assistance, while being?yBV reluctant to spend their own resources in the cause of the Great Powers. They HBJH think that their greatest contribution to peace consists in a steady and copiousH supply of rice-in which &apos;view they are largely justified.  Unless, however, the BHjH Siamese are satisfied that they will receive material support, they may in the     I KVJend follow the line of least resistance, as they did with Japan in 1941 and comeBHH to terms with Communist China, thus contributing to their own downfall. BHJHHBj (g) Indo-China and Indonesia HHI?VBS 30.   Economically important to the whole of South-East Asia as sources of fcVJHByfl food, neither country has been able to assist in providing appreciable amounts    H LBV.HHBJ to deficit areas owing to the unsettled conditions brought about by the struggle?VBVJ between Nationalist elements and the French and Dutch.   There is now some bVB.^^^H hope of a settlement which will not only lead to better relations with FranceHHBJ and Holland, but will remove the remaining causes of East-West friction^^^H generally. Time will, however, be needed before any stabilisation of the position    I aVJ^^^^ in either country can be expected, and it is unfortunate that Indo-China, where?yBV the French feel that at least another nine months to a year will be needed to set    I HHI^^^H the country on its feet again, will be more directly threatened than any other ??VJHH South-East Asian territory, should China fall under Communist control. If the?yByj Bao-dai regime succeeds, this may persuade India to abandon her partisan attitude; HHJ^^^H towards the Communist Ho Chi Minh, but it is as yet too early to foresee the    I LVJHHBJ outcome of the present French experiment.   It is certain that Ho, Chi Minh,?VBVJ whether with Chinese Communist help or without, will not abandon his position LVJwithout an intensification of the struggle.  Against this, however, the presenceBAVJ of French troops and the retention of bases by France, which form part of the^^^H present agreement, should act as a reasonably effective counter to infiltration or    I hVV.^^^H direct aggression from China, although here again charges of &quot;imperialism&quot;?vBVj may be the price to be paid for greater security. HHflHH (A) Malaya?VBVJ 31.   Malaya is of the utmost importance strategically and economically to&lt;^^^H the United Kingdom, and is the major dollar earner of the sterling area. There LVJ^^^H is a growing Malay nationalist movement which, but for the promulgation of LVJ?vBVJ the new constitution, might have become anti-British.  But owing to the Malay^^^H fear of the Chinese, coupled with an appreciation of our liberal policy, tips move-    I bVB.^^^H ment is not directed against the British connection.  The campaign against the HVJ?Hi Communists is proceeding satisfactorily, although the danger of the large Chinese I^^^H community acting for a Communist China will remain a constant threat to be    I ?VJ^^^H watched. On the other hand nothing succeeds like success in the Orient, and the hVV.?yBM final liquidation of the Communists in Malaya and the assurance that we are^^^H not prepared to abandon the area and are taking effective steps to safeguard     B ?WflHHBj it from external aggression may do much to encourage the local Chinese to believe?VBVJ that reinsurance with a Communist China is not an absolute necessity. Tfere^^^H are indications that if we pursue our present course in Malaya the Indian     I KB!HHBV Government would prefer us to retain a stake in the country rather than push ABB.?BHfl their views on &quot; colonialism &quot; to the lengths of condemning our presence.?V^pH (i) The Philippines?Hh 32.   The recent Chiang Kai-shek-Quirino talks have shown that the-^^^H Philippines are not averse from some form of regional co-operation to resist,     U HHjBHBV Communist aggression.   They would, therefore, probably be willing to take AHI.?BHH advantage of any ultimate scheme which was backed by the Western Powers HHfl^^^B and in particular by the United States, though Filipino leaders would be more     I AHIBBBJ inclined to use any regional association as a means of bolstering up their own
internal political position than to furnish any positive contribution for the generalgood. While bringing little positive strength to any Asian Union, therefore,the Philippines would nevertheless serve as&apos;a link in a system embracing South-East Asia and the Far East and Pacific areas.&apos;?:      (j) Hong Kong33. Hong Kong, although in the Far Eastern area, is a British commitmentI       and our actions there are likely to have their main repercussions in South-EastAsia. It is therefore being examined with the other South-East Asian countries.34. We must accept the position that both Chinese Nationalism and ChineseCommunism aim at the eventual recovery of Hong Kong. This may be attemptedeither by the threat or the use of force, by pressure through incitement to internalunrest or economic boycott, or by negotiation.35. We have already taken steps to meet .the threat or actual use of force.Provided we do not reduce our military commitments it is considered that HongKong can be held against pressure.36. Any indication that we were prepared even to contemplate withdrawalfrom Hong Kong in the face of Chinese Communist pressure would have farreaching effects on the general position in Asia. Not only would local ChineseCommunists in South-East Asian countries become convinced of the necessitythrow in their lot with the Government in power in China (and hence providethat Government with a fifth column within the countries opposed to it), butthe other Asian peoples would interpret any weakening on our part as theSpinning of a general retreat and would immediately consider making termswith the new power of Communism. From an economic point of view such adevelopment would be a disaster for us, while politically and militarily the con-sequences would be equally grave.I 37.   With regard to negotiation, we should not be prepared to negotiateabout the status of Hong Kong except with a friendly, democratic and stableGovernment of a united China. These conditions are not likely to exist in theforeseeable future.V^H 38.   Our legal justification for the retention of Hong Kong and the NewTerritories is unassailable. There are also strong economic reasons for our stayingthere. In addition to these factors the wider political considerations mentionedin paragraph 36 make it essential that we should not weaken in our intention tostand our ground.General Conclusions on Political Collaboration on a Regional Basis39. From all the above it is clear that the situation in South-East Asiawould not allow of any attempt being made in the immediate future to bring abouta greater degree of political co-operation on the lines that have been followed inI Western Europe. The United States are not prepared to play the same partor to produce the same material incentives to greater unity. A system whichexcluded Great Britain, France and Holland would be weak and would lack V^^|community of purpose with the West. For the time being, however, France andHolland, and to a lesser extent Britain, are suspect. There are further manylocal jealousies and rivalries to be overcome (as in the Middle East) before thecountries concerned can be expected to work in harmony. Any thought of aSouth-East Asia Pact can therefore be ruled out for the time being. ^^^H40. At the same time, our policy can follow certain definite lines in the ^^^Jpolitical field which will prepare the ground for greater future regional ^^^Hco-operation in the political sphere.   These lines are:- ^^^H(1) The removal of East-West discoM by developments that will prove that ^^^Himperialism and racial superiority are dead. ^^^H(2) The use of our influence in bringing about the settlement of national ^^^Hfi|                     rivalries, in the area. ^^^H(3) The discreet promotion of greater solidarity between the Commonwealth ^^^Hcountries of the area (including Australia and New Zealand). jNRa ^^^H.|||; (4) Keeping the United States informed of our positive programme and, as J^^Hoccasion arises, getting them to afford such assistance as they can. ^^^H
?I I bIBVB                      (5) Emphasis in propaganda on the menace that Soviet Communism presents B BVB^^B                               to nationalism.   The countries of South-East Asia have not emerged ^^B^^B                               from dependence merely to fall under the new Russian (or Chinese) ^^BBVB                               Imperialism. ^^B^^B                      41.   In pursuing this policy, we shall have to face the difficulty of being ^^BBVB                unable to satisfy Asian demands for large amounts of material assistance.  The ^^B^^B                Asian countries will constantly subject us and the United States to threats that ^^B^^B                unless more help is forthcoming they may have to make the best terms they can ^^B^^B                with Communism and Russia.  Further, we cannot expect democracy to develop ^^Bnecessarily on our pattern, or that corruption and inefficiency will vanish over- ^Bfl^^B                night.  We must take a realistic view of the East as it is and rest content that ^^B^^B                if we can get it on our side that is the most we can hope for.  It will for a great ^^BPAyJ                many years be the fact that the masses of the peoples of Asia will have little PMVJvoice in government and universal suffrage is only likely to be exploited by the ^^B^^B                governing classes who, on the whole, are few and venal and in many cases ^^BPAVJ                inexperienced in the art of government. I PMVPMH                                                           Far East B ByBAmerican Policy(1) In China and Korea PAVJ42.   Our post-war policy in the Far East so far has been to allow the United ^^B^^^b States to take the lead in the development of Western policy in the region. The ^^B^^^P|               result has not been a happy one.   In China, American policy has proved a total^^^H               failure and shows a tendency to go into headlong retreat.   In South Korea it has ^^B^^^H               succeeded,- it is true, in setting up a Republic whose present leaders are committed ^^Bto a policy of co-operation with the West and are indeed dependent upon American W.aid.   But the Republic rests upon exceedingly flimsy foundations and the pros- ^^Bpects of its survival against pressure from the Soviet-dominated People&apos;s Republic ^^BPfl               of North Korea are doubtful.   The United States would not be prepared to inter- IBvene to preserve the status of South Korea. ^^BBVJH                (2) Japan I BVB^^^h                     43.   There remains Japan.   Here the United States have carried out their ^^B^^^B               immediate post-war tasks competently.   Their attitude towards the future, how- ^^BBVJ               ever, gives cause for anxiety.   It is hard for them to realise that the American 1 &quot;MVJ^^^1               occupation of Japan is an unhealthy influence for the basic reason that, by filling ^^B^^^B               the gap in Japan&apos;s deficient economy, it fails to provide a real incentive to the ^^BBV^h1               Japanese to set their own house in order, while the maintenance of the occupation BNBbwI^^^B               itself, without any assurance that it will soon end or that the Japanese have any ^^B^^^B               prospect of rejoining the comity of nations, deprives the Japanese of hope, and ^^BPAVJ               thus renders them particularly susceptible to any trend which may appear to offer ? ^^B^^^B               them a preferable alternative, e.g., Communism. ^^BBBBJ                    44.   The conclusion to be derived from the two preceding paragraphs is ^^BI              that United States policy, proceeding unilaterally in the Far East, is damaging B BB               both to the United States and to the West by diminishing the influence of the whole ^^B^^^B              and creating animosities against the West generally.   In the case of Japan, the m ^^BBBftJ               United States not infrequently succeed, in the Far Eastern Commission, in aligning B ^^B^^^B              against themselves those Powers who, in the order of things, should be on their ^^B^^^B              side.   The problem here is therefore not primarily how to deal with the Far ^^BPABH               Eastern nations themselves, but how to persuade the United States to adopt ^^BBHBJ               different tactics, not only towards those nations, but also towards their friends. BaBBbVJ                                                United Kingdom Policy ^^B^^^B                    45.   As regards Japan, it is the United Kingdom view that there should be BlBBjBBBV               an early Peace Treaty, whereafter Japan should be in a position to resume her ^^B^^^Bj              international relationships.   Post-treaty controls should be confined to the control B ^^B^^^H              of such raw materials as would enable Japan to re-arm to the extent of once again ^^B^^^B              becoming a military menace.   The security of Japan and the denial of her islands ^^B
I 45 II j to a potential enemy might be ensured by a bilateral defence agreement between theUnited States and Japan which would enable the former to retain bases in JapanI proper.   It must be our aim both to persuade the United States of the necessityH of following this course and to try to carry the Commonwealth and other FarI I Eastern Commission Powers with us in this view.   It must be expected that the| ! Soviet Union and a Communist Government of China (if it is by then in being) \^mMI | will do their best to obstruct this policy.   In the last resort therefore, the like- m^LmI minded countries may have to make up their minds to pursue it without the Soviet^^fl   I Ilnion or China.   In a post-treaty Japan, the United Kingdom would try, in close^^|H consultation with the United States and the British Commonwealth, as well asI with other like-minded Powers represented there, to steer the Japanese awayI from Communism and towards a closer association with the West.   Though ourI resources will be strictly limited, our experience and knowledge of the JapaneseI people should provide a valuable contribution towards the common end. MilitarilyI we cannot accept any commitment in this area.I China46. There dp not seem to be any further grounds for hope that theI Communists will fail in their bid for complete power in China and planningI must therefore be on this assumption. There is no doubt that the present leadersI of the Chinese Communist Party are orthodox Marxist-Leninists and that their^^^^H1 present strongly pro-Soviet policy constitutes a serious threat to Western politicalI and economic interests not only in China but also in South-East Asia-47. As regards South-East Asia, it is of cardinal importance to encourageI the establishment of an effective anti-Communist front to prevent CommunistI encroachment beyond the borders of China. In China itself the only hope ofI encouraging the emergence of a less anti-Western tendency is to give the new19 regime time to realise both the necessity of Western help in overcoming its economicI difficulties and the natural incompatibility of Soviet imperialism&apos;with ChineseI national interests.  For this reason it is considered that Western commercial andI financial interests should try to maintain themselves in China for as long asI possible, while recognising that the ultimate aim of a successful Communist regimeI will be the elimination of foreign establishments.  Our merchants and missionaryI communities in China represent the only contacts with the West which the ChineseCommunists will have, and it is important to maintain these contacts as long asI ptesible. In the long term the potentialities of China under a strong and efficientI government, even though it be a Communist government, as a source of rawH materials and food-stuffs and as an export market, must not be forgotten.48. While for the above reasons the United Kingdom are not in favour of aI policy of premature evacuation from China-and this view is fairly generallyI held by other Powers, both Western and Asiatic, with interests in China-thisview is not apparently shared by the United States.  United States nationals inI China are being encouraged to evacuate; the consular establishments at Canton,I Kunming, Chungking and Tihwa are being closed and instructions have beenI issued drastically to reduce the staffs at Nanking and Shanghai.   The presentI 1 American policy appears to tend in the direction of allowing China to relapse j^^HI into complete chaos in the hope that this will encourage the Chinese people toI overthrow their Communist rulers.   It is impossible to say whether this AmericanI trend will persist or whether the United States will eventually come round to ourHi view, which is that we must try to keep a foot in the door.49. Some time is likely to elapse before Communist China will be in a H^HJI position to assist materially in the growth of Communism in South-East Asianterritories. But the moral effect of their successes is already having some influence.H There is a natural tendency on the part of Chinese communities overseas to come ^^^HI to terms with the Government in power in China, not from any political conviction, H^HJI but because of their strong ties with the mother country and their readiness toI bow to the inevitable.   There is thus a very real danger that the Chinese com-ft I munities in South-East Asia will form the hard and by no means negligible coreVJ of Communist expansion in this region.   Against this, anti-Chinese feeling existsI amongst all the indigenous inhabitants of South-East Asia, and has manifestedI    itself on occasion in the past in riots and even massacres of Chinese. ^^^H
Military Co-operationThe Danger of Chinese Aggression50.   China is so weakened by years of war, maladministration and economic Ichaos that it is unlikely that the Chinese Communists will embark on any military ^|^^Hadventures against their neighbours for some years to come, unless in the course Iof a general world conflict between Russia and the West.   This does not, however, 1mean that territorial claims, accompanied by threats may not be put forward 1^^^1 against China&apos;s southern neighbours.   Any weakness or wavering among these Ineighbours will also be exploited.^^^h 51.   Far more obvious dangers are:-(1) Active support of the Communists in Burma and Indo-China and the 1^^^h &quot; Freedom Movement &quot; in Siam, thus producing a situation similar to^^^H that in Greece in all three countries; and^^^B (2) The use of large local Chinese communities in South-East Asia as a Ipowerful Communist Fifth Column, corroding from within andultimately, if circumstances are favourable, seizing power. I^^^h These dangers&quot; jnay become imminent in the near future and will affect the whole I^^^fl security of South-East Asia.^^^H Security Considerations52. The countries most open to direct aggression by the Chinese Communists jare Burma, Siam and Indo-China, while all the.other countries in South-East Asia I^^^H are extremely vulnerable to Communist disruption and subversion from within.53. It is therefore vital that the countries south of China should be not oily I^^^M                   politically stable, but capable of dealing militarily with insurrectionist barids I^^^H                  either operating from China or from within as in Malaya and India.^^^H 54.   The- vastness of the area to be covered and the slenderness of Britaap 1^^^H military resources mean that we could not undertake to provide military support on I^^^H any appreciable scale in the face of widespread Communist guerrilla activities over^^^H the whole area or in the event of a world war.   Nor, in view of the lack of political ^^fl^^H| cohesion in South-East Area, is it likely that other countries in the area would I^^^H wish to become involved in helping a neighbour, even if they felt capable of doing^^^H so, which in their present state of unpreparedness would be extremely unlikely. H^^^H Ultimately the responsibility for the defence of South-East Asia must rest on the^^^H countries concerned themselves.   For the time being, however, there is little hope I^^^H of any wide strategic co-operation between all the countries concerned.   The most^^^H that can be aimed at therefore is that each country individually should put its I^^^H armed forces in the best possible shape to prove effective in the event of internal^^^H disorder or infiltration from without.^^^H ^f^&apos;- The United Kingdom&apos;s Role in the Military Field^^^H &apos; 55.   The security jfeoblem, unlike the political or economic one, is o t some^^^H urgency since the Communists mfejy well soon control all China.   It is primarily II a problem of security against internal unrest stimulated from outside.   It is in H^^f^^^H United Kingdom interests j^a ,&apos;gOine priority should be given to the security&quot; of^^^^M the area, without which political and economic co-operation are unlikely to advance H^^^H at all.   Much can be done politically to encourage the will to resist, but in the^^^^H purely military field, despite our lack of real forces, we shall again have to play HH a positive role if the area is not to fall piece-meal into Communist hands.   To thisend the most hopeful course seems to be to:-^^^^h (1) Persuade the countries of South-East Asia that their ultimate military  ^^^^H salvation lies in their own hands.           f|&gt;            Vfif^&apos; &quot;^^^^H (2) Encourage them by our continued strategic interests in the area, by^^^^H readiness to help with technical advice and military missions if H^^f^^^^H welcome, and by supplying arms to the greatest extent possible.  In H^^H^^^^H supplying armaments American help would be of the utmost value, and V^^H^^^^h despite American - reluctance to provide assistance for South-Eastri^Asia, it may be necessary to try and convince them of the need for I^^^^H arms now, if the programme we should like to follow in the economic^^^^H and political fields is to have any chance of success from its inceptiojt. I
II 46 IKB bB(3) Finally, as in the political field, to attempt to obtain a nucleus of strategic BVA]co-operation between the Commonwealth countries of Asia, ourselvesand the Australians and New Zealanders, before any wider regionaldefence system itself may be practicable. This co-operation would haveto be entirely in the field of planning and exchange of views since theB actual supply of arms would still be expected to come from the UnitedPJVJ Kingdom, whose many other commitments would not allow of any ?VAagreat increase over the present flow.H Economic Co-operationThe Economic Situation56. The feature which all the countries of South-East Asia and the Far &quot;MVJEast have in common is the very low standard of living. Although the area is BVJVJprincipally agricultural it can only feed itself on what from Western standardsj  would be a semi-starvation level.  Furthermore, India, a country with as many PAVAjinhabitants as the rest of the countries of South-East Asia and the Far EastI      combined (excluding China), is a net food importer.   The general standard ofPJVJ nutrition of the area as a whole, low as it is, therefore depends largely on the???      l^fp^ty  ^ surPms       areas to provide for deficit areas. The troubles in Burma,Indo-China and Indonesia have seriously affected the surplus amounts of rice BVAVJi       available for export and have aggravated the generally unhealthy economic ^^^BPAH situation of the area, resulting from the war. &quot;&quot;MPJ57. In the field of economic development the Asian countries are withoutI    I the resources or technical skill to embark on their own rehabilitation andPAVJ      I improvement. They will therefore be forced to look elsewhere for help and theirI eyes are at present turned towards the West. ^^^J1 58.   For the West itself the area provides a field where capital investmentI may produce quick and profitable returns provided that the political stability of hVAVJthe non-Communist countries can be maintained.   The need for technical assis-I tance should provide openings for Western industry and commerce. A risingstandard of living in Asia would provide large and steady markets for Westerngoods. PAVA]PJPJ The Economic Possibilities, ^^^H59. There are, therefore, three factors in our favour PJPJ]1 (1) The East needs our assistance and may well accept Western co-operation ^^^Hin the rehabilitation of the economic life of the area.(2) Historic economic ties exist between East and West which render BBfleconomic co-operation less suspect than attempts to promote greater V^Bjpolitical co-operation.(3) The West is in a position to provide the technical help which the East ^^^flrequires in its reconstruction. &quot;flMPJThe interdependence of the area for food supplies is an incentive to greater ^^^Hregional co-operation.  Pandit Nehru himself has now announced his conviction B^HPPAPJI       that India needs tfie help of European industry.  If India, the key to South-East ^^^HAsia, is prepared to examine the possibility of greater economic regional PAPAPJcollaboration in which the West could* also play its part, the other countries of ^^^HPAPJ the area would soon follow her lead. ^^^H60. The United Kingdom may be said to have been the pioneer of regional PAPAPJco-operation through the establishment in 1946 of the special Commissioner&apos;s ^^^HPAPJI       organisation in Singapore, subsequently absorbed by the Commissioner-General. ^^^Hjfebsequently there was established the United Nations Economic Committee for BBMVJAsia and the Far East (E.C.A.F.E.).  Including as it does the Soviet Union in BHPAPJ         its membership, it is doubtful whether this organisation will really develop ahealthy spirit of regional co-operation, though we are committed to its support. ^^^HVaVm f    The Prospects for Economic Development B^HP61. If the thesis is accepted that the most profitable line to pursue is the ^^^Heconomic one, there still remains the problem of how to find from our slenderresources sufficient for. the development not only of India and Pakistan but of B^HPJ^^P  ?   South-East Asia as a whole, especially At the present time when demands from
&quot;?BwJ the Colonial Empire are particularly heavy.  The question is now being studiedby the Far Eastern Official Committee and the results of this study cannot herebe prejudged. This paper only attempts to set out the policy to be pursued. But Hifr seems probable that although the demand by South-East Asia may well be VJHyAa enormous, it may be possible (especially if effective use is made of &quot; Fourth Pointassistance &quot;) to meet sufficient items for the whole venture to be considered a^^^H feasible proposition.The Prospects of the Economic Approach62. Political differences between the countries of South-East Asia and theFar East and their unwillingness and inability to collaborate militarily, leaveeconomic collaboration as the only form of greater unity which the countries of thearea are likely to accept at present. But the habit of collaboration is a catchingone and the settlement of economic difficulties, of common consultation and effort,may well lead to greater political and military cohesion. In promoting greatereconomic collaboration, the West does not labour under the same handicap of^^^1 suspicion of imperialism or selfish exploitation as it would were it to try to^^^H promote political or military unity.  Regional collaboration in the economic field,if achieved, may well lead not only to a better understanding between the countriesof Asia themselves, but also between East and West. It is therefore at present theonly possible line to pursue in the direction of our long-term objective of politicalB^Bj and military, as well as economic co-operation throughout the region in partner-^^^H ship with the West.^^^h ConclusionsB^Bj 63.   Assuming that the political and economic stability of South-East Asiaand the Far East is of prime importance to the West, that this can best be broughtB^Bj about by greater regional collaboration and that it is for the United Kingdom toB^BJ play the major role in bringing this regional collaboration into being, the followingB^Bj conclusions are reached on the course to pursue:-Hw^H (1) For the present our policy must confine itself to South-East Asia. Only^^^H if some stable system emerges there, will the countries of the Far EastB^Bj later attach themselves to it.^^^H (2) In the Far East our main problem lies not with the inhabitants or Gov-^^^H ernments of the area, but with the United States whose policies weB^Bj must endeavour to influence along lines acceptable to ourselves.^^^H (3) In China we must try to keep a foot in the door in the hope that we shallKv^H be able to maintain China&apos;s contacts with the West and that we may _HyJ^^^H be able to take advantage of any rift between Communist China andB^BJ the Soviet Union.^^^H (4) In South-East Asia, greater measure of regional co-operation is at^^^H present only practicable in the economic field.   Though its own^^^H resources are insufficient to meet the large demands likely to be made,^^^H United Kingdom has the major role to play in promoting regionalHy^Bj economic co-operation which, in turn may lead to regional collaboration LHyJ^^^H in other fields.   But she should play this role as unobtrusively as^^^H possible and encourage Asian countries to assume the initiative whereB^Ba this can safely be done.^^^H (5) In all fields-political, economic and military-the Commonwealth^^^H countries of Asia, with the United Kingdom and Australia and New^^^H Zealand, present a nucleus on which to build.By^Bj (6) South-East Asia is not yet ripe for greater political collaboration either KyH^^^H internally or with the West.   Much can, however, be done along theB^ByJ lines suggested in paragraph 40.By^BV (7) The security of the area is the most pressing problem, but for the time^^^H being we can only work with individual countries.   Our general policyB^BB is laid down in paragraph 55.^^^H (8) Only if we show our willingness and ability to bring about greater AsianHy^H solidarity, will the Americans be prepared to assist or to come into any Bny^^^H regional arrangement.   Convincing planning and some interim sue- IBy^BJ cesses may, however, persuade the Americans to give practical interimB^^H aid which would further our ultimate aims.By^BJ (9) No plans will, however, be really successful without American partici-B^Bfl pation and our main object must be to secure this.
