P. C. (h9) 102and 110) and on measures to combat inflation (E.P.C. (49) 111).2. The Committee accept as a general diagnosis of thesituation that if we are to take advantage of the opportunitiescreated by re-valuation to expand our exports to hard currencymarkets, v/e must, alongside positive measures to increase productivity and production, take steps to secure that our .efforts are not frustrated by the pull of the home market.     Tothis end, we must- secure that the increase of inflationary press-UJ?e which, there has boon in wftsnt.  irws*wo        .1....-  ^w^wvw^       uuu. uuc .juu-tit;v uanimates, anci &quot;Cncfurther increase which will folloi/ diversion of goods to export markets with a consequent diminution in the goods available fortho home market without diminution of personal incones, arecorrected by appropriate disinflationary measures at home.3* It is not practicable at the present stage to attemptany precise quantification of the extent of this inflation.  -The time for such estimates will be in the spring in prepara-&quot; -tion for next year&apos;s budget, in which it will be possible toconsider all the measures of a budgetary character which willbe required to meet the situation created by re-valuation asit will then be developing.      It is, however, clear thatsignificant contributions to these measures will have to besecured in the form of reductions of the capital investment programme to bring it into line with the savings likely to beavailable to meet it and reductions of Government expenditure to secure a true budget surplus of the amount we require.      Itis equally clear that if measures in these respects, are to bein operation in time to have a significant effect on nextyear&apos;s budget, they must be started forthwith.k* The judgment of the Economic Policy Committee,after prolonged discussion of the situation, is that we should introduce measures designed to secure as soon as possible economies of between  250 and  300 millions, as compared withthe forecasts under current policies and rates of expenditure,and that this sum should be roughly divided between capital investment and Government expenditure.     But in view of the inevitable uncertainty of the factors from which this judgmentis formed, the sum aimed at can only be regarded as a guide tothe Cabinet of the magnitude of the measures required.      Presen-tation to Parliament of our conclusions will be on broaderlines without mention Of any specific target.

5. The measures recommended Toy the Committee and now submitted to the Cabinet for approval are as followsInvestment programme. The Committee recommend for approval from theproposals in paragraphs 7 to 16 of E. P. 0.(1+9) 111 the follow-,ing broad pattern of reduction to which the investment programmes Committee should work for the latter half of 1950:-  millionFuel and Power &apos; 25Transport and Communications 10Agriculture, Fisheries and 3ForestryShipping -Iron and Steel -Manufacturing Industry 15New Housing 35Other Social Services 12Defence and Administration 5Miscellaneous 35140Government expenditure. The Committee recommend for approval the items inSchedule I and Schedule II of E. P. 0.(1+9) 111? including such&apos;further economies in administration and in these services asit may prove possible for the Departmentss in consultationwith the Treasury, to secure in detailed examination.      Asregards Schedule III. (items involving major Government policyoutside the field of social services), the Committee recommendapproval of items 1, if. and 5, but, as regards item 33 recommendapproval of item 3(c) only.      The Cabinet will note that these items include dropping the Second Register of Electors eachyear.8. As regards Schedule &quot;V (new services not yet-inoperation which could be abandoned or deferred), the committee recommend a partial deferment of Legal Aid and the lord president has undertaken to secure a reduction of  1 million in the estimate for the Festival of Britain.

This figure is a long way short of the necessarytotal, and any further administrative economies which may hesecured in the examination of the measures recommended cannotamount to more than a few millions.      The Committee were accordingly obliged to consider other matters raising moreimportant questions of Government policy.(a) National Health Service11..- In the case of drug prescriptions., tho Minister- of*Health is of opinion that it would bo beneficial to tho efficiency of this scheme if a flat rate charge were imposed which wouldhave substantial effect in eliminating unnecessary resort toprescriptions and the Committee recommend that a charge of oneshilling should be made for each prescription.The charge would produce, a saving of  10 million ayear.(b) Hon-basic foods^2. The Committee recommend an increase in the price ofcertain non-basic foods and a cut in retail milk marginswhich together will produce  3. 5 millions a year.(c) Subsidies on Feedingstuffs13. The Committee believe that in view of the large pro-vision at present included in farmers&apos; incomes for capitalexpenditure there is scope for some reduction.     Any reductionmust be secured through an annual or special review of thegeneral economic condition and prospects of the industry.The Committee therefore propose that notice should now begiven that the subsidies on feedingstuffs will be discontinuedat the time of the next February review.      That review will bemade with knowledge of the discontinuance and will settle howfar the cost will be met by a reduction in the farmers&apos; incomes.Any part of the cost not so met will not, however, be coveredby an increase in the ordinary food subsidies but will be passed on to the consumer.a The Minister of Health is considering what administrative economies he can secure in the Health Departments and the health Service.

l^l i      , Jhe items mentioned in-the last three paragraphstotal  43.5 million, making a total of the economiesrecommended of  86.5 million.Defence *15. * There remains the question of defence.     Thedefence ostimatos for the current year vorc  760 million,and suprloniontarios were in prospect for  30 million(apart from the effects of re-valuation), for certain.now commitments (eg. Hong Kong and &apos;..&apos;o stern Union),and for further payments arising out of war-time sc-ttlc-monts.     It is not practicable at the present moment tosettle tho provision of defence estimates for nextyear.        , -16. The Service Ministers, however, have in hand aseries of administrative economies in the Services vrtiich will produce reductions of expenditure of  12? million in theremaining five months of the current year, i.e. at the rate of 30 million a year.17. These economies will continue in the following year,but no decision can be reached at the moment as to what the resulting defence figure will be.Summary18. The total economies recommended in this part ofthis paper, counting defence for this purpose at  30 million,amount to  116.5 million, or with the reduction of  140 million in the capital investment programme,  256.5 million in all.This is some  20 million short of the middle figure of the .range of from  250 million to  300 million mentioned early inthis paper and the Chancellor of the Exchequer takes the viewthat it is necessary that some further economy of about this,amount should be secured.      He suggests that this should comeby decreasing the subsidy on milk by ?d a pint.C. E. lit, Downing Street, S.V/. 1.20TH OCTOBEE,   1949.
