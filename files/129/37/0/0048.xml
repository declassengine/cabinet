(49) 248 ,I2M December, 1949CABINETRECOGNITION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST government memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs. IntroductionCP. (49) 214 of 24th October set out the case for and against recognition ofthe Chinese Communist Government and drew the conclusion that on political as well as practical grounds, we should recognise the Peking Administration. Inthe light of this appreciation of the situation the Cabinet on 27th October(CM. (49) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 7) authorised consultation with the rest ofthe Commonwealth, the United States and other friendly Powers on the basis ofthe views set out in CP. (49) 214.2.   The results of these consultations are set forth below. /-:II. Attitude of Foreign Governments. 3, United States. The United States Government felt strongly that as longas there was any opposition to the Communist regime it would be a stab in the back if recognition were to be accorded. They attached great importance to obtaining an assurance that the Communist Government is prepared to acceptChina&apos;s international obligations. Mr. Acheson, at a press conference on 7th December, reiterated the view that recognition of the Chinese communist government in the immediate future would be premature and that even con-sideration of recognition was premature. Subsequently, Mr. Acheson expressedthe hope to Sir Oliver Franks that there will be &quot;a large-ish time gap between a decision on the date and the act of recognition &apos;&apos; in order that public opinion in the United States may be properly prepared. He also expressed the hopethat we should not seek concerted action by members of the Commonwealth,since he feared that this would tend to give emphasis to the suggestion that theBritish and Americans were going their separate ways. The United StatesGovernment would accordingly favour an arrangement whereby members of theCommonwealth would accord recognition &quot; at several intervals of time.&quot;4. France. The guiding consideration for France is her difficult situationin Indo-China and the fear that de jure recognition of a Chinese communist government without any corresponding gesture of approval towards the Bao DaiAdministration would jeopardise the prospects for the latter. On the general political issues involved in recognition the French Governmenfs views coincidefairly closely with pur own. They would like to see a united front maintained,since recognition by some, iii advance of others, might lead to discrimination, but atthe same time they would be loath themselves to accord de jure recognition to theCommunist Government until the control of South-West China has passed into their hands. They have expressed the hope that we shall delay our recognitionof the Chinese Communist Government as long as possible, and though they maywell expect that we shall accord recognition in the fairly near future, they mayreproach us if we do.37996 b
5. Netherlands. The Netherlands Government are in general sympathy with what they call our &quot; realistic approach.&quot; They are, however, anxious notto accord recognition before the transfer of sovereignty in Indonesia. This isnow due to take place on 27th December, and recognition in the neighbourhoodof that date is unlikely to raise any acute problem for the Dutch.6. While the Scandinavian countries are generally prepared to accordrecognition as soon at we have done so, the Italian and Portuguese governments are somewhat more hesitant and are most certainly influenced in this by theAmerican attitude to recognition. The Belgian Government have associated themselves with the French desire that our recognition should be delayed as longas possible.7. Of the attitudes of the Powers mentioned above, clearly that of theUnited States is of the utmost importance. Moreover, whatever the attitude ofthe United States Government, there will certainly be widespread dislike in theUnited States of the necessity of recognition. There may well be criticism ofour action, and unless carefully handled this may become vocal in Congress.Mr. Acheson&apos;s views, recorded in paragraph 3, therefore merit serious considera-tion. As regards France and Belgium, our Brussels Treaty relationship would naturally incline us to meet their wishes as far as is practicable. On the otherhand, neither France nor Belgium plays a leading part in Asian affairs, and european reactions to recognition are not, on balance, the most important.8. In Asia, Burma has indicated a desire to accord recognition soon after11th December, and may be unwilling to defer the date. Siam, which befpre1946 had no relations at all with China, may be reluctant to accord recognition,while the Philippines may conceivably follow the lead of the United States.III. Attitude of other Commonwealth Governments9. Commonwealth views reveal a wide measure of agreement, and while there is some divergence as to timing or tactics, in no case have the reasons whichhad led us to decide in principle in favour of recognition been disputed. Themost important points of difference are that Australia on the one hand is againstimmediate recognition and would prefer to see the question put on the agenda of the Colombo Conference, while India on the other hand is anxious to accordrecognition as soon as the present Session of the General Assembly is over. india has indicated that she may in fact accord recognition at some time between 15thand 25th December. The Australian Government, in addition, consider that someprior assurance should be obtained from the Communist Government to the effectthat they would assume China&apos;s international obligations and respect the territorial integrity of China&apos;s neighbours. The views of Australia and New Zealand havebeen influenced by the general elections in both countries.The views of the new Government of New Zealand are as yet unknown.10. Ceylon, Pakistan, Canada and the Union of South A frica have expressedviews which agree generally with our own, although in the case of Canada thereis reluctance to march too far out of step with the United States, and the canadian government have recently stated that they would prefer to postpone theirrecognition until after the Ceylon Conference. The Government of&quot; the Union ofSouth Africa have also indicated that they would prefer not to be in &quot; the firstbatch &quot; to recognise.IV. Singapore Conference11. The Conference of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Far East, whichwas held in Singapore between 2nd and 4th November, considered that thesituation in South-East Asia and the Far East demands that de jure recognitionshould be accorded to the Communist Government of China at the earliest possible moment. They recommended that no formal conditions should be attached to suchrecognition. In their view recognition should be accompanied by a strengthening of our resistance to the spread of Communism in South-East Asia. TheConference, in addition, emphasised the need for (a) an extensive propaganda campaign to explain that recognition does not imply any inconsistency with our policy of opposition to Communism;(6) every effort to minimise the adverse effects of any disagreement with theUnited States over recognition.
It was emphasised at the Conference that recognition of a Chinese communist government in ChinaS and increased resistance to Communism in South-East Asiawere not necessarily incompatible.What happens in China isv the business ofthe Chinese and we should merely be recognising an accomplished fact; what happens in South-East Asia: is the concern of the Governments there which are opposed to Communism.12. The Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office has given it as his opinionthat our recognition should be without conditions, since no change in the inter-national obligations of a State are brought about by a change of regime, and itis, therefore, unnecessary to insist on explicit acceptance of this principle by anew r^ginie. r Indeed, to do so has its disadvantages, since this opens the way tothe argument that a new regime is only bound by the previous obligations of thecountry if it expressly says that it will be. To seek such an assurance would notstrengthen our position in law. On the other hand, it would certainly giveconsolation to bodies such as the Council of Foreign Bondholders, who have largevested interests in China. But, since an awkward answer from the Chinese tosuch an approach, if made, would speedily dispel any hope in the hearts of those interested, it would probably be better tactics to make a quite separate public statement in answer to an inspired Parliamentary Question, which would notinvite any comment from the Chinese Communist Government.&quot;V. Timing of Recognition13. At the meeting in London on 15th November with the CommonwealthHigh Commissioners the Foreign Secretary made the suggestion that it wouldprobably suit, the convenience of Commonwealth and other friendly Governmentsif the act of recognition was delayed until a date early in the New Year, since by then the Chinese: motion in the United Nations Assembly would be out of theway, the Australian and New Zealand elections would be over, the netherlands government should have transferred sovereignty to Indonesia and the FrenchGovernment should have ratified their agreement with Bao Dai.14. In the light of the Indian Governmenfs views referred to inparagraph 9- above, it seems probable that India will accord recognition inDecember whether other Commonwealth countries recognise or not. Since UnitedKingdom interests in China are far greater than those of any other Common-wealth country, and since we. have also to consider our position in Hong kong and our vital interests in Malaya and Singapore, it seems clear that a firmdecision should be taken without delay. With a view to holding India on theone hand and on the other to stimulating the less ready among&quot; the other friendlyGovernments, all haye been informed that His Majesty &quot;s Government expect totake a decision between 12th and 19th December.VI. Effects of Recognition15. It will be appreciated that recognition does not of itself make theCommunist authorities the rulers of China. They are that already. Recognitionis no more than an acceptance of a fact, which its withholding would not alter.Nor, in view of the almost total collapse of the Nationalist Government, canit any longer cogently be argued that recognition would undermine what might otherwise have been effective resistance to Communism. Conversely, to with-hold recognition from the Communist Government now that no other effectiveauthority exists in China would imply a deliberate policy of boycotting China.The effects of such a negative policy on our long-term relations with China aswell as on our trading interests in China need no elaboration.16. Politically, recognition implies our willingness to enter into diplomatic relations with the new Government and does not signify approval of its ideologyor outlook. It follows logically from recognition that we would acccept theCommunist Government^ claim to represent China in all international organisa-tions. Her vote, by contrast with that of the Nationalist Government, would almost certainly be cast against us on most major issues. The political advantages of recognition are calculated on the assumption that we cannot afford to ignore,however much we may disapprove its political orientation, a government which37996 B 2
has effective authority over a vast territory and population. Similarly, it is assumed that without relations with this Government, we shall be in no positionto exert any influence on its future development.17. We have had no diplomatic representation with the nationalist government since Canton fell on 14th October, so that the withdrawal of recog-nition from that Government presents no immediate practical problem in China.His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers would remain in Nationalist areas, includingFormosa, and maintain de facto relations with the local authorities.Military Effects18. The Chiefs of Staff have studied the military aspects of recognitionand have reached the conclusion that de jure recognition of the Chinese Com-munist Government is likely, on balance, to have an adverse effect on our military position in the Far East and South-East Asia. The military disadvantages willnot be sufficient, however, to outweigh any strong political or economic advantage which might accrue from recognition.Treaty Rights19. While the Chinese Communist Government have on the one handannounced their willingness to &quot; establish diplomatic relations with any and all foreign Governments willing to observe the principles of equality, mutual interest,and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty,&quot; their press on the other handhas announced that all Kuomintang agreements are liable to re-examination and revision. We should therefore assume that, irrespective of any unilateral state-ment we make about the Communist Government^ assumption of China&apos;international obligations, in fact it is improbable that these obligations will beregarded as binding. Delay in recognition is, however, unlikely to lead to any satisfactory assurances on this point, and in the absence of relations, the Treatyrights are themselves of no value. Recognition may therefore lead to a laboriousand unpromising series of negotiations on the revision of existing treaties with china and in particular of the Sino-British Treaty (1943) on relinquishmentof extra-territorial rights, on which our existing rights of property ownership and of travel, pnd our rights in respect of shipping and consular representation in China are based. Similar considerations apply to the various Financial, air and other Agreements. We should have no illusions in this respect, but shouldbe prepared to insist on strict reciprocity.Propaganda20. In the propaganda field we may expect that, at the worst, the Chinesepress and radio will continue their attacks upon &quot;Western imperialism,&quot; andthat Chinese Communist propaganda will follow the Moscow pattern. In such circumstances recognition of a Chinese Communist Government should not in anyway deter us from taking appropriate counter-measures in the territories forwhich we ourselves are responsible, or from encouraging our friends in South andSouth-East Asia to do the same. In this country careful publicity will be requiredto explain that recognition implies neither approval nor disapproval of the ideo-logy or outlook of the new Government but is merely an acceptance of the factthat they are now rulers of China.British Trading Interests21. While recognition is unlikely to provide any immediate panacea forBritish trading interests in China and to a lesser extent Hong Kong, it may beexpected to provide that minimum protection necessary to their continued exist-ence. While the new regime is not at present so corrupt as its predecessor, its authority may well prove even more arbitrary and vexatious in its regulations.Its realisation of its need for some Western trade is, however, indicated by thevery fact that the foreign trading communities have not been uprooted. in individual cases, their position, particularly under the totalitarian juridicalsystem of the &quot; people&apos;s Courts,&quot; may prove precarious.Hong Kong22. At the Bukit Serene Conference the Governor of Hong Kong expressed himself in favour of early recognition of the Chinese Communist Government in
414view of the very large Chinese population in Hong Kong and the New Territories,It is true that with recognition air Chinese Government assets will necessarily beregarded as vested in the new Government. This may create a difficult problem for the Governor of Hong Kong, but it may be less embarrassing than the presentposition in this respect. The Governor of Hong Kong, who recognises that theappointment of a Communist representative after recognition cannot be avoided^would prefer that such a representative should continue to have the undefinedstatus which the Nationalist representative at present enjoys, though his presenttitle of &quot; Special Commissioner for Kwangtung and Kwangsi &quot; should if possiblebe changed to &quot; Special Commissioner for Hong Kong.&quot; On balance it is thoughtpreferable not to press for the appointment of a Consul-General, who might insist on exercising privileges not at present exercised by the Special Commissioner.Malaya and Singapore23. The Governor of Singapore and the High Commissioner for Malayaboth favour early recognition of thf3 Chinese Communist Government, since they feel that continued non-recognition will be misunderstood by the large Chinesepopulation in these territories and render them less co-operative. It is recognisedthat the appointment of Chinese Communist consuls will create difficulties. It is felt that the appointment of Communist consuls cannot be long delayed, thoughany possible delay should be contrived while the present emergency remains.While Chinese Communist consuls can facilitate communications, their presenceis not essential to the conduct of subversive Communist activities in Malaya, whichcan easily be stepped up by the infiltration of Communist agents who may or maynot have affiliations with Chinese consulates.Chinese Nationalist Representation in London24 On the day that we choose for according de jure recognition to thePeople&apos;s Republic of China it will be necessary to inform the present ChineseAmbassador of this decision and to request him to consider himself henceforwardas a private person. Dr. Cheng, whp has a life-long connexion with the UnitedKingdom and is a Bencher of the Middle Temple, is certain to ask for permission to establish residence in this country. It is recommended that this should, begranted and that the same concession be allowed to any members of his staff who can make out a reasonable case. In practice the majority will probably opt for service under the new regime.25. As regards consulates, having regard to the position in Malaya and singapore, it may be desirable not to close the Nationalist Consulates forthwithbut to allow them to continue until such time as the Chinese Communist Govern-ment notify us of their intention to take them over. In the interim period, theposition of Nationalist consuls will be anomalous, but it is by no means improbable that certain consular staffs will go over to the Communist side and take service under the Communist Government.British Representation in Nationalist China26. As stated in paragraph 17 above, we have no diplomatic representatives in Nationalist China. Day-to-day business with the Nationalist authorities on theChinese mainland will be carried on through His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Kunmingso long as Kunming remains in Nationalist hands and through His Majesty&apos;sConsul in Formosa. These officers should be left at their posts and should maintain local contact with the local authorities as before on a de facto basis.United Nations27. The Soviet Union and certain satellites have already expressed the view111 the United Nations Assembly that the present Chinese delegation no longerrepresents China. Until, however, the status of the various Chinese representa-*ives in the United Nations is changed by a decision of some organ or organs0f the United Nations, they will presumably continue to retain their seats. Thisquestion is of particular significance in relation to the Security Council, where, inaccordance with the normal procedure, the Chinese representative will be in thejhair in January 1950, when the Kashmir dispute may still be under considerationby the Council. While there seems to be no reason why the United kingdom should take any initiative in the matter (since it would not be inconvenient for
us for the Nationalist representative to retain his seat in the Security Counciluntil such time as he is displaced by some generally accepted decision), we must accept the position that after recognition we shall have to cast our vote for the admission of the Communist representative. Assuming that we have accordedde jure recognition to the Chinese Communist Government, our attitude shouldbe, if approached by that Government, .that the replacement of the variousNationalist representatives by Chinese Communists is a matter for the united nations and concerns the United Kingdom only as an individual member of that organisation. . *28. We must nevertheless accept the fact that a difficult position is boundto arise sooner or later, and that no precedent exists for the expulsion of repre-sentatives who refuse voluntarily to vacate their seats which are claimed by a successor Government. If, as we may suppose, the United States delayrecognition of the Chinese Government, there may be the two extremes that theUnited States openly support the Nationalist representatives, while the soviet union (and presumably Yugoslavia, who has recognised the Chinese communist government) will refuse to do business with them. In between these two extremesthe situation may be that the United Kingdom and India, for example, who by then will have recognised the Chinese Communist Government, will refuse totake sides in the matter until the question of representation has been thrashedout. It must be admitted that such a situation will not be conducive to the smoothworking of the Security Council, or indeed the other organs concerned. But sincethe Soviet Union and satellites have already taken their stand in the matter, thesituation is likely to arise whether the United Kingdom and India recognise theChinese Communist Government or not.Conclusion29. We have now reached the stage when we have consulted with friendlyGovernments on this question and have to make up our own minds. There is an obvious danger if recognition is delayed too long, and the time may not be very far distant when, if it is withheld any further, the Chinese Communist Govern-ment will begin to put pressure upon our interests in China, and even demand thewithdrawal of our officials. We shall then be compelled either to accordrecognition under duress or to withhold it indefinitely as a gesture againstcoercion. To adopt the first alternative would be to weaken our whole positionand prestige in the Far East. To adopt the second would be to sacrifice our interests in China which we have been at such pains to maintain. Therefore,though it is possible that we may not carry all the friendly Governments with us and though it may be difficult for the United States to follow our lead, at anyrate for some time to come, everything points to the conclusion that we should now decide to accord de jure recognition to the Chinese Communist government at an early date.30. If this conclusion is accepted, it is suggested that the chinese communist Government should be notified at an early date of our decision to accord de jure recognition. An opportunity should be given for friendly Govern-ments, if they feel so disposed, to synchronise their own action with ours.Recommendations31.   I invite my colleagues to agree that (a) A decision be taken to accord de jure recognition to the chinese communist Government at an early date. .(b) Other Commonwealth Governments, the United States and other friendlyPowers be notified of our decision and the reasons for making it and invited, if they feel so disposed, to synchronise their action with thatof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.E.
