frlS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY*S   GOYERNB^NT^ /Printed for the Cabinet. December 1949SECRET Copy No.   3j[CP. (48) 25217*A December, 1949CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT MAN-POWERMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerFollowing a decision taken by the Economic Policy Committee on 9th November, 1948 (E.P.C. (48) 35th Meeting, Minute 1), the Prime Ministerapproved proposals which I submitted to him after consultation with the Ministerof Health for setting up a Joint Committee of representatives of central andlocal government, under Treasury Chairmanship, to review the administrative arrangements between central and local government in England and Wales witha view to economy of man-power. I have now received the First Report of thisCommittee and, with the Prime Ministers approval, I announced, in answer toa Question in the House of Commons on 15th December, that it would be published as a Command Paper early in the New Year. I circulate the Report herewith,for consideration by the Cabinet.2. The Committee have so far concentrated, in accordance with their original instructions, on simplifying the numerous forms of control by Govern-ment Departments over local authorities, and agreement has been reached at the -Departmental level on a wide range of detailed recommendations which are summarised in the Appendices. The next stage of the Committee&apos;s work willbe to tackle the. problem of achieving actual savings of man-power and improve-ment of procedures on the local authority side. The Committee have adumbratedin the last paragraph of the Report on pages 4-5 the way in which they proposeto tackle this.3. The only points on which I think that the Government need reserve their position are those at which some further legislation is foreshadowed. These,however, are long-term matters which are not of immediate importance. Subjectto this, I commend the Report to my colleagues for their approval.4. Although the Treasury have so far taken the lead in the work of theCommittee, since it involved co-ordination of a number of different GovernmentDepartments, I think that any questions about the implementation of the Reportin the different Departmental fields should be handled by the Ministers concerned and that the responsibility for any general follow-up action on the Report asa whole should be taken by the Minister of Health.R.

52FIRST REPORT OF THELOCAL GOVERNMENT MANPOWER COMMITTEETo the Rt. Hon. Sir Stafford Cripps, K.C., M.P., Chancellor of theExchequer.terms Of reference . We were appointed in January, 1949 with the following terms ofreference:-&quot;To review and co-ordinate the existing arrangements for ensuringeconomy in the use of manpower by local authorities and by thoseGovernment Departments which are concerned with local governmentmatters; arid to examine in particular the distribution of functions between central arid local government and the possibility of relaxingdepartmental supervision of local authority activities and delegatingmore responsibility to local authorities.&quot;The scope of the Committee is confined to England and Wales..- We under-starid that a Committee with similar terms of reference has been appointedby the Secretary of State for Scotland.2. We now have the honour to present our First Report, which covers our work from the date of our appointment up to 16th November, 1949.INTRODUCTORY STAGES3. It may be useful to record briefly the circumstarces in which the Com-mittee came to be appointed. In June, 1947 the Ministry of Health circu-lated to local authorities Circular No. 96/47 inviting them &quot;to undertakean immediate review of the organisation arid staffing of all departments and services for the administration of which they are responsible with the objectof effecting all possible economies and making the fullest practicable reduc-tion in the numbers employed &quot;. The circular drew attention to the heavytasks which local authorities had been given in carrying out essential ser-vices and went on to say that &quot; every endeavour will accordingly be made,in carrying out the Government^ policy, to limit the demands made upon local authorities to what is reasonable, and it is the desire of the Govern-ment to simplify so far as possible the administrative arrangements asbetween the Departments and the local authorities in connection with these services &quot;.4. Soon afterwards the local authority Associations* were invited bythe Ministry of HealuY to attend a conference to discuss this circular. Atthe&apos; conference; which was held in July, 1947, and in a subsequent memorandum-randum winch they forwarded to the Ministry of Health in March, 1948,the representatives of the Associations suggested that the extent to which government Departments concerned themselves with the details of localgovernment added materially and unnecessarily to the administrative workof both central and local government and that only by a substantial diminution-tion of departmental controls could a really effective reduction be madein the size of local authority staffs. Suggestions were made in the memo-randiuh of a nurnber of ways in which controls might be loosened. after consulting the other Departments most concerned, the Ministry of Healthreplied to the Associations in October, 1948, conveying the views of these* County Councils Association, Association of Municipal Corporations, Urban district councils Association, Rural District Councils Association, London County Council and metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee.1
Departments and stating that in general they would be glad to be given further information about the aspects of their control which in practiceproved most burdensome and to enter into detailed discussions about adminis-trative procedures. The Associations then decided to appoint a jointsteering committee to guide these discussions with Government Departments,APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE5. This was the stage which had been reached when in December, 1948,in the course of a review of the general manpower situation and in particular of the heavy demands made on manpower by central and local administra-tion, the Government decided to invite the local authority Associations(including the Association of Eduoation Committees) to join departmentalrepresentatives in a comprehensive examination of the whole problem. Wewere accordingly appointed in the following month with the terms of refer-ence set out in paragraph 1.6. We decided at the outset that since our main problem was one whichconcerned central and local government equally, we could best undertakeour task as a gathering of representatives with individual views, in whichideas and comments could be freely exchanged, rather than as two negotiations-ing teams. This decision has been abundantly justified by the co-operativeand amicable spirit in which our discussions have taken place.7. We felt that there was force in the suggestion, which had been madeearlier by the Associations, that the manpower problem could best be tackledin the first instance by examining the relations between Government Depart-ments and local authorities and by considering what scope there was for reducing the extent of central control. We decided therefore to concentratein the first place on the second half of our terms of reference and to examine in detail the various forms of departmental supervision over local authorities.APPOINTMENT OF SUB-COMMITTEES8. It was clear that such a detailed examination could not satisfactorily becarried out by the Committee itself, and we accordingly appointed for thispurpose five sub-committees to examine the local government services super-vised by the Departments concerned. These sub-committees were coin-posed in each case, under the Chairmanship of the departmental representa-tive on the main Committee, of a number of government officials (usuallybetween six and nine) and about an equal number of local authority officersselected by the Associations for their experience in. the service concerned.One of the latter acted as convener of the local authority representatives on each sub-committee. The representatives of the Treasury Organisationand Methods Division, the Ministry of Labour and National Service and thePost Office, who were appointed to the Committee as &quot;independent&quot;members, also took part in the work of the sub-committees.9. In some cases, either because a single Department was concerned with more than one local government service or because of the wide range of questions involved, sub-committees themselves delegated detailed studies topanels, which were similarly composed, usually under the Chairmanship ofthe official responsible in the Department for the administration of theservice in question. In all over 90 local authority and about 160 departmentalofficers have up to the present time taken a direct part in the discussions of these various bodies and these have all contributed to the results embodied in our report.
10. In order that the sub-eommittees should start their work with a clear understanding of what was asked of them, we prepared a Memorandum of guidance (which is attached as Appendix I) setting out the main principlesin the light of which we were agreed that the existing forms of control oughtto be reviewed. The memorandum also suggested a number of aspects which required special consideration. The sub-committees were appointed inMarch, 1949, and submitted either interim or final reports for considerationby us at a meeting in July.WORK OF THE SUB-COMMITTEES11. The reports of the sub-committees bore witness both to much hardwork by all concerned and to an impressive, spirit of co-operation which wasreflected in the wide extent of the agreement which had been reached. Theresults of the Committee*s deliberations on the basis of these reports are summarised in Appendices II to VI. These set out the revised arrangementsfor central and local government procedure which the Committee now recom-mends for the future.12. The degree of control retained by Ministers varies by reason of thenature and circumstances of each service and this has precluded uniformity in all services. But the revised arrangements represent a considerablesimplification or loosening of departmental control and recognise, inaccordance with the Memorandum of Guidance, &quot; that local authorities areresponsible bodies competent to discharge their own functions and that . . .they exercise their responsibilities in their own right . . .&quot; We wish toemphasise that if the new arrangements are to be a success, they must be supported by close and continuous co-operation and informal discussion between Government Departments and local authorities.GENERAL QUESTIONS,13. A number of general points were also raised by the suib-committees in the course of their work, which were of concern to more than one department and in some cases affected Departments not represented on theCommittee.   These fall under four heads:  (i) Grant claims and loan sanction procedureSeveral of the points so raised related to the administration of grants and to the procedure for obtaining loan sanction. We accordinglyappointed a sub-committee on Grant Claims and Loan Sanction Pro-cedure to consider these and any other points raised in this field. this sub-committee has reached agreement on revised administrative arrange-ments, and its report, which we have endorsed, is reproduced with ouradditional recommendations as Appendix VII.(ii) Control of building resourcesOther points were also raised relating to the control of building work under Defence Regulation 56A, to the system of quarterly allocations of building materials, and to the starting-date procedure. These are forthe most part temporary controls and are closely related to the Govern-menfs general economic policy. We accordingly appointed a sub-committee on the Control of Building Resources, to which the Ministryof Works and the Central Economic Planning Staff were invited toappoint representatives. This sub-committee met under the shadow ofthe economic crisis following devaluation and, in view of the Government
announcement that drastic reductions in the investment programme willhe necessary, it has not been possible for the sub-committee to formulateany proposals at the present juncture for relaxing the Government^control over the building work of local authorities. It has, however,made certain suggestions as to ways in which the procedure of thedepartmental controls over local authorities&apos; building operations mightbe eased, and the departmental members of the sub-committee have undertaken to consider these suggestions carefully and to introduce anysimplifications which may be found possible while paying due regard tothe over-riding necessities of the economic situation. The sub-committeewill consider the matter further as soon as this departmental examinationhas been completed.(iii) Land transactionsA number of general points were also raised in the sub-committeereports concerning the acquisition, appropriation, leasing, and sale ofland. These are, for the most part, long-term changes which will involve legislation. We have asked the Local Government Servicespanel of the Ministry of Health sub-committee to consider these questionsfurther, bringing into their discussions representatives of any otherDepartments as may seem desirable.(iv) Valuation and the use of the District ValuerOur local authority members have urged the view that there shouldbe some modification of the present Government practice of requiring the approval of District Valuers in all cases of acquisition or sale ofland and property by local authorities, whether or not the authority has its own valuation staff. The departmental representatives, while recognising that this is a matter on which many local authorities feel strongly, have pointed out that it touches on a major issue of government policy, and they suggest that it is not a matter on which the Com-mittee could appropriately express any view, still less take any decision.They have expressed their willingness, however, to hear the views of thelocal government representatives.APPLICATION OF AGREED CHANGES14. In some cases it has already been possible to bring into force thenew arrangements which have been agreed upon. For example. Ministryof Health Circular No. 75 of 1949 gives effect to the recommendation inparagraph 6 of the Housing panel summary (Appendix III, page 11). Inthe majority of cases, however, the changes involve a concerted revisionover quite a wide field and we suggest that the aim!should be to &quot;bringas many of them as possible into operation in time to be effective forthe financial year 1950-51. We think that it will usually&apos; be desirable for the sub-committees and panels to remain in being during the existenceof our Committee to consider how and when the agreed changes can best be put into effect and to help Departments to work out the practical details,for example by discussing the drafts of hew manuals and circulars. Thiswill, however, in no way supersede the Departments&apos; normal practice of consulting the local authority Associations on such matters.FUTURE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE15. Having so far concentrated on &quot;the possibility of relaxing depart-mental supervision of local authority activities and delegating more respon-sibility to local authorities &quot;, we propose now to turn our attention to the
first part of our terms of reference: &quot;To review and co-ordinate the existing arrangements for ensuring economy in the use of manpower by localauthorities and by those Government Departments which are concernedwith local government matters&quot;. In this connection we intend to considerthe methods of procedure and organisation for handling the various services at the local authority end. The local authority Associations, at our request,are considering the best approach to this problem and have already set upa sub-committee to investigate, within the framework of the existing law,the procedure for delegation of powers from county councils to district councils and other bodies. They are also enquiring into the machinery of claims by local authorities against one another for services rendered or mutualbenefits provided, and are proposing to stimulate the extension to thelocal government field of Organisation and Methods techniques, which havebeen practised in the Civil Service for many years. We feel certain thatour work to date will encourage local authorities to renew their efforts in examining staffing and manpower problems and to review their arrangementsfor ensuring that staff is economically used. We are assured that steps arebeing taken to carry out a similar review in the Government Departmentsconcerned, the results of which we shall have an opportunity to consider.We also intend to obtain estimates of the manpower savings made possibleboth in local authorities and in Government Departments by the revisedadministrative arrangements which we recommeud. We shall report further on these matters in due course.Signed on behalf of the Committee:P. D. Proctor, Chairman.Arthur Hobhouse, Vice-Chairman.9th December, 1949.APPENDIX memorandum of Guidance to Sub-Committeesi. introduction .The Local Government Manpower Committee was set up with the follow-ing terms of reference :       ;      ., &quot;To review and co-ordinate the existing arrangements for ensuringeconomy in the use of manpower by local authorities and by thoseGovernment Departments which are concerned with local governmentmatters ; and to examine in particular the distribution of functions between central and local government and the possibility of relaxingdepartmental supervision of local authority activities and delegatingmore responsibility to local authorities.&quot;It is hoped that the sub-committees, in considering the questions which arise from the main objective described in the next paragraph, will givethe Committee their advice on any matter falling within its terms of refer-ence, whether it relates to departmental procedure or to local governmentprocedure or to both.
To simplify the methods of departmental supervision over local govern-ment activities, to reduce the need for and the extent of such supervision,and to ensure, wherever possible, that a greater measure of responsibilityrests on local authorities.III. GENERAL approach to recognise that the local authorities are responsible bodies competent to discharge their own functions and that, though they may be the statutorybodies through which Government policy is given effect and operate to alarge extent with Government money, they exercise their responsibilities in their own right, not ordinarily as agents of Government Departments.It follows that the objective should be to leave as much as possible of the detailed management of a scheme or sendee to the local authority and to concentrate the Departments control at the key points where it can most effectively discharge its responsibilities for Government policy and financialadministration.IV. DESIRABLE METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED WHERE CENTRALAPPROVAL IS REQUIRED(i) Government Departments to issue, where appropriate, broad general guidance by way of circulars or manuals indicating what theGovernment wants the local authorities to do and specifying anyconditions which must be satisfied by a scheme or service if itis to receive Government approval and qualify for grant.(ii) The local authorities to submit (not more frequently than once ayear) programmes showing the work proposed to be carried out and the estimated cost.(iii) The appropriate Departments to give formal approval of the pro-grammes, with or without alteration, this approval to constitute an authorisation to proceed with the programme without further consultation, except for any particular projects (or classes of projects) which may be explicitly reserved for individualconsideration.(iv) The approval given in (iii) to carry with it normally and subjectto the same exceptions an assurance that any loan sanctionrequired for the execution of the programme, and the appro-priate rate of Exchequer grant where this applies, will be given.Where an increase in the estimated cost is involved, furtherapproval must be sought.(v) In those cases which are reserved for individual consideration theobject should be to give $he approval, with or without altera-tion, at a single stage, not in instalments at different stages inthe execution of the scheme. /(vi) The local authorities to make progress returns and returns of ex-penditure on services in prescribed form and at prescribed periods,which should not be too frequent.(vii) Arrangements for inspection and comment on the services by officers of the central Departments to continue.(viii) Informal contact to be maintained at all times between adminis-trative and technical officers of the central and local authoritiesin order that experience may be pooled and mutual understandingensured.
V. ASPECTS TO BE SPECIALLY CONSIDERED(i) The main field to be covered is that of the normal permanent rela-tionships between local authorities and central Departmentsrather than the temporary controls necessitated by the presentconditions of shortage. There may, however, be subjects inthe latter field which would repay examination, particularly the controls over local authorities&apos; building work, where it shouldbe possible to introduce simplified methods similar to those whichhave recently been applied to industrial building work.(ii) The achievement of the objectives may entail amendment of statutes,statutory regulations or administrative arrangements. Obviouslythe last-named present the easiest problem and will no doubt be the first on which action can be taken, but the whole fieldshould be reviewed on merits in the light of the considerationssuggested above. If the results of the examination point to theamendment or withdrawal of existing regulations or - statutory provisions, action to secure this should then be considered.(iii) It may be convenient to consider capital schemes and continuingservices separately. Generally speaking, the latter should pre-sent the clearest opportunity for reducing detailed supervisionto a minimum and relying on the approval of periodicprogrammes.(iv) There is a broad distinction in principle between departmental responsibility for policy and departmental supervision over thetechnical aspects of a scheme. The one admittedly shades intothe other, and it may not always be easy to apply the distinctionin practice. The Department has an undoubted responsibility to ensure that Government policy is carried out, and the degreeof control which it must retain to enable it to discharge this responsibility represents an irreducible minimum beyond whichrelaxation cannot go. If, however, the policy and technicalrequirements of the Government are clearly indicated in advance by the issue of circulars or manuals, and if the local authoritycertifies that these requirements are fulfilled in the particularproject under consideration, while full contact is maintained incurrent administration between officers of the central and localgovernment, there should be considerable scope for reducingor eliminating departmental supervision on the technical side andavoiding the irritation and waste of manpower involved in super-imposing a detailed examination by the professional staff of theDepartment on the work already done by the professional staffof the local authority.(v) The maintenance of effective financial control over grant-aided ser-vices is a requirement which runs through all the aspects pre-viously mentioned and will need careful definition in each field.It is a subject in which the House of Commons, through thePublic Accounts Committee, takes a jealous interest, and thereis a clear duty on the appropriate Department to ensure thata proper and economical use is made of the taxpayers money.But in general there is no reason why the same principles shouldnot be applied here as in the rest of the field. In particular,there may be scope for employing the method of laying down and enforcing-maximum limits of expenditure or contract pricesbased on the estimates submitted by the local authority in itsperiodic programmes.

Each local authority will submit an annual programme of works showingthe expenditure which it proposes to incur on:  (a) Works of repair and maintenance.(b) Works of adaptation.(c) New buildings including police and fire service houses.The expenditure which it is proposed to incur on works of adaptationand new buildings will be suitably itemised in the programme.2. (a) Police BuildingIt is proposed that, subject to approval of the annual programme,local police authorities should be free to carry out, without further reference to the Home Office, works of maintenance and repair andother works costing not more than  5,000. It is assumed that localpolice authorities will continue to employ qualified architects and thatthere will be the closest informal consultation with the Home Office.(b) Children&apos;s Homes BuildingIt is proposed that, subject to approval of the annual programme,local authorities should be free to carry out, without further referenceto the Home Office, works of maintenance on children&apos;s homes andadaptations of existing children&apos;s homes costing not more than  2,000which do not involve an increase in the number of places for childrenor a change of purpose. These arrangements will apply for an interim period up to the end of 1952, pending the issue of manuals of guidance on the construction and adaptation of children&apos;s homes, and will besubject to review before the end of this interim period in conjunctionwith the local authorities if the Home Office so request.(c) Fire Service building a higher proportion than hitherto of the annual sum allocated to each local fire authority for building works will be at its free disposal for works of maintenance and adaptation. i&quot;
* The recently made Police Regulations give effect to the principle of this recommendation by providing that members of the police force shall be paid at such intervals as the police authority may fix, that the police authority may fix different intervals for different classes,and that -in fixing the interval for any class the police authority shall have regard to thewishes of the members of that class.3. The procedure for obtaining approval for works other than those covered by paragraph 2 above will ibe simplified on the following lines : (a) The local authority will submit for each project sketch plans, a brief or outline specification, and an estimate of the cost, andany proposals by the Home Office for modifications will bemade at this stage;(b) the local authority will not normally have to refer the project tothe Home Office again unless there has been a material departure from the sketch plans or unless the tender which it is proposedto accept exceeds the estimate of cost (by more than five per cent.;(c) when application is made for loan sanction the local authority willforward with the application a note of the tender price;(d) the local authority will in due course furnish the Home Office witha note of the final cost in cases where it exceeds the approvedestimate and with a copy of the final plans if required for recordor grant apportionment purposes,4. The Home Office are considering the question of issuing further modelplans for certain types of buildings.5. As regards police and fire service housing the Home Office willconform to the revised housing procedure of the Ministry of Health (seeAppendix III).OTHER REVISED ARRANGEMENTS6. Police(a) The Home Office will replace the present annual return of pensionsawarded by police authorities by a less detailed statistical returnto show the incidence of pension charge.(b) The Home Office will review the criminal statistics with a view to considering whether the burden which their compilation throwson the police could be lightened.(c) It is desirable on grounds of administrative economy to paypolice on a monthly rather than on a weekly basis if the consentof the rank concerned is obtained and no hardship is created.*(d) The sub-committee will consider the question of control over policepay, emoluments and conditions of service when Part II of theOaksey Committee&apos;s report is available, and it will also considerthe detailed working of the present arrangements for the control exercised by the Home Office over the police in other fields.7. Children(a) The Home. Office will replace the existing control of expenditureji on an individual child boarded out by a more general financial control related to the total number of children boarded out. Thiswill obviate the need for reference to the Home Office in particular cases.(b) The Home. Office will issue manuals of guidance on provision forthe care cf children, for example, on standards of accommodation and on the organisation of reception centres and residentialnurseries.
(c) The Home Office will endeavour to secure the establishment of wage-fixing machinery for the staffs of children&apos;s homes, approvedschools and remand homes ; if possible such staff will be brought within some existing negotiating machinery.(d) The Home Office will consider the simplification of procedure forthe disposal of parental contributions collected by localauthorities.(e) The Home Office will consider the introduction of greater uniformity in control of expenditure on children&apos;s homes, approved schools and remand homes.(j) Certain returns will be discontinued and the need for others will be reviewed.(g) The Home Office will consult the local authority Associations witha view to discontinuing the war-time arrangement whereby 50per cent, of any allowance payable by a Service department or by the Ministry of Pensions, which is suspended while a child is maintained at public expense, is credited to the local authority concerned.8. Fire Service(a) The Home Office, in consultation with the local authority Associa-itions, will consider what can be done within the terms of Section19 of the Fire Services Act, 1947 to simplify the procedure forthe approval of establishment schemes and to allow for some measure of variation at the discretion of the fire authority.(b) Prior approval for the purposes of grant will not be required inthe case of a scheme for the installation of hydrants where thecapital cost does not exceed  500, provided that no departureis contemplated from the prescribed standards.(c) Local purchase of uniform and equipment will be resumed as suppliesbecome more easily available.(d) Subject to the provisions of the establishment scheme and to com-compliance with requirement specifications approved by the CentralFire Brigades Advisory Council, no prior approval will be requiredfor the conversion or adaptation of vehicles.APPENDIX IIIMinistry of Health Sub-committee chairman: Sir John Wrigley, K.B.E., C.B.Housing PanelChairman: Mr. N.

1. The. Ministry&apos;s approval of individual building sites selected by localauthorities (involving the submission of detailed information by local authori-ties on Form Eng. 102) will be dispensed with. The Ministry will issue amemorandum of guidance explaining the object of the questions in FormEng. 102, and will require from local authorities only a certificate signed by a competent person, stating that the memorandum has been followed foreach site and that the authority is satisfied on the questions contained inForm Eng. 102.*2. Local authorities may assume when the Ministry inform them of thenumber of houses they may build in any one year that, subject to anyoverriding change in Government policy, their approved current annual rate of house building may be repeated for at least three years on theunderstanding that they will have regard to cleared sites in their possessionwhen estimating need for additional land.Lay-out Schemes3. (a) Sketch lay-out plans will be submitted to the Ministry, who will- be assumed to have no comments on them unless these aremade within 14 days of receipt.(b) When the lay-out scheme has been prepared the local authority will submit an estimate of cost, with application for loan sanction,accompanied by a certificate that the scheme in its final formdoes not depart in principle from the sketch plan. If the estimate is ^approved loan sanction will be issued. Tenders may beaccepted if they are not more than 10 per cent, in excess ofthe approved estimate, and additional loan consent will be givenfor an excess within that limit. Re-submission will be necessary if there is material departure from the sketch plan or if itis proposed to accept a tender above the 10 per cent, tolerance.House Construction4. (a) Prior submission of house plans will be dispensed with and onlya tender need be submitted, if a local authority certifies that the plans were prepared by, and will be carried out under the advice of, a qualified architect, and that the standards conform to the relevant manuals or circulars. There should be the closestinformal consultation between architects of the Ministry and oflocal authorities. If a qualified architect is not employed, houseplans must be submitted for examination.(&amp;) In loan sanctions issued for house building provision will be madefor necessary margins on contract sums, but excess expenditureamounting to a variation in principle of the basis of the originaltender must be submitted like the original tender. The same principles will apply to direct labour estimates.5. The Panel will examine the monthly Housing Progress Report with aview to recasting and shortening it: certain regional forms will be further examined and a minor amendment will be made in the forms of claim for housing subsidy.6. The present limits on expenditure which local authorities may incuron a requisitioned house or flat without the prior approval of the ministry will be raised from  50 to  100 per dwelling for maintenance repairs andfrom  100 to  250 per dwelling for initial adaptations.7. The Panel will consider in draft any instructions on improvements ofhouses which it is proposed to issue under the Housing Act, 1949.* The detailed application of this new procedure is being further considered by the panel.
HEALTH SERVICES&quot;11. In their inspections of the day to day running of the local health services the Ministry&apos;s officers will be encouraged not to initiate official correspond-ence on relatively minor matters of detail but to dispose of such matters bydiscussion on the spot. Local authorities will have almost complete freedom in the matter of running expenditure, subject to the services being inaccordance with the proposals approved by the Minister under Section 20of the National Health Service Act, 1946 and, of course, to ultimate review by the District Auditor.2. The present detailed examination by the Ministry of all capital projectswill be dispensed with, except that, for the time being at any rate, plans for building health centres will continue to be submitted and examined in detail.Manuals of guidance on building works (though not standard plans) willbe issued and local authorities will be encouraged to discuss their projectsinformally with the Ministry&apos;s officials at an early stage. Local authorities will in October - November of each year submit an annual programme ofcapital works (a) for the coming financial year and ib) which are beingconsidered for later years. An undertaking will be required in the programme for the coming financial year that schemes will comply with any essential requirements laid down by the Ministry. Approval of this part of theprogramme will be on the understanding that competitive tenders will beinvited and that any scheme will be referred to the Ministry again if thetender price exceeds the estimate by more than a specified percentage, or ifa tender other than the lowest is accepted. The Ministry will reserve theright to hold back any particular scheme for detailed consideration. Noti-fication of proposals under preliminary consideration will constitute advance information for discussion and will commit neither side.3. Where &quot;joint user&quot; services are concerned (e.g. a combined school and maternity and child welfare clinic) negotiations with the local authority willbe carried on by one central Department only: the local authority will refer the scheme to the appropriate Department, which will undertake any neces-sary consultations with the other interested Departments.4. The provision of additional institutional accommodation for low grademental defectives will enable local health authorities to employ their trainedstaffs engaged in domiciliary mental work and at occupation centres to muchgreater advantage. All parties concerned should watch carefully thedevelopment of the services for the care of mental patients living in thegeneral community to avoid the risk of overlapping and waste of effort.5. The visual inspection procedure in the administration of port health services is being reviewed by the Ministry.6. The Panel is considering the control exercised by the Ministry overthe appointment and removal of medical officers of health and sanitaryinspectors. ..7. The Ministry have arranged to discuss with the Ministries of food and Agriculture and Fisheries and local authority representatives certainproblems which arise from the administration of the Food and Drugs Actsand the rodent extermination service.WATER AND SEWERAGE1. A short manual of guidance on procedure $ill be issued. Althoughprimarily non-technical, it will include a few basic technical requirements.* This panel deals with local health services provided under Part III and Section 51 of th&amp;National Health Service Act, 1946: :   iV
2. The issue of loan sanctions to large authorities for prospective experidi-ture on rhain-laying will be extended to include all authorities.3. Loans for prospective expenditure will foe admissible for programmes of works of sewerage and works authorised by the Public Health or local acts on water courses, subject to certain specified conditions and exceptions.Extensions through which trade waste will foe received may be included inapplications for loan sanction for prospective expenditure, but special attention will be drawn in the manual of guidance to the difficulties involvedin the reception of such waste.4. When application is made for Exchequer grant for prospective expendi-ture, schemes will continue to receive individual consideration by theMinistry.5. Capital schemes may in future be submitted for approval in principle in outline and the amount of information required may be limited to the bases of calculations, the fundamental assumptions on which the design isbased, and drawings in sufficient detail to enable the Ministry to appreciate the general scope and nature of the scheme.6, Where they are not required by statute, local inquiries will be reducedto a minimum by substituting informal visits by technical inspectors or, ifan inquiry is thought to be necessary, by asking the local authority toadvertise its proposals: the Ministry will then consider in the light of any objections received whether a local inquiry should be held.7. In scrutinising schemes by district councils under Section 2 (2) of the rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act, 1944, county councils shouldlimit their examination to the broad basis of design, general sanitary andfinancial considerations, and the desirability of co-ordination with adjoiningareas. -8. When building controls are removed it may be possible for the ministry to issue loan sanction for the estimated cost of schemes approved in principle,leaving it to local authorities to select a tender, provided that the selectedtender does not exceed the estimate by more than 10 per cent, (or 5 per cent,in the case of large schemes) and that if the lowest tender is not acceptedthe reason is given.LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES*1. Informal discussion of projects at an early stage is to be encouragedand at this stage it will be considered whether phasing or programming is practicable, how much technical information will foe required and whetheroutline plans only will suffice. All interested Departments should berepresented at the informal discussion of a project.2. Where they are not required by statute, local inquiries will be reduced:in appropriate cases the Ministry will ask the local authority to advertiseits proposals and will hold an inquiry only if required on special grounds or if the weight of objection merits one. The Ministry will re-examine thepractice of requiring shorthand notes to be taken at all Compulsory PurchaseOrder inquiries.3. Where the Board of Trade does not support a local authority&apos;s proposalto establish a factory estate, but does not positively object to it on location of industry grounds, the Ministry will entertain the proposal if the authoritywishes to go forward with it and to assume responsibility for the financial risks involved.* This panel deals with miscellaneous matters, and capital works in services administeredToy the ministry, other than services discussed by other panels and National Assistance.     &apos;
/4. Government circulars should be printed in larger and better type andshould state their purport plainly at the beginning. The periodical lists ofcirculars issued by the Home Office and the Ministry of Health should indicate their subject matter in greater detail and similar lists might be issued byother Departments.5. The law relating to private street works and to the disposal of thedead should be revised and simplified.APPENDIX IVMinistry of Education Sub-committee chairman:   Sir  William  Cleary,       Convener: Dr. W. P. AlexanderK.B.E., C.B. (Secretary, Association of Educa-tion Committees).1. The sub-committee has considered in an interim report some of the changes in methods and machinery which follow from an examination ofgeneral principles of control, the Ministers duties entailing control, andthe key points at which control is needed. Further possible changes will beconsidered in due course.2. While the Minister has a general oversight of the field of education,it is recognised that he has six primary duties which determine the points at which it is necessary for him to exercise control:(i) He must be satisfied that educational facilities and ancillary services are provided in sufficient quantity and variety.(ii) He must be satisfied that educational establishments and ancillary services are well managed, equipped, staffed and maintained.(iii) He must ensure the proper freedom of parents, teachers and otherthird parties.(iv) He must be satisfied of the qualifications of teachers and medical officers to the extent necessary to safeguard their and thechildren&apos;s interest.(v) He must control fees charged and awards and allowances made, tothe extent necessary to safeguard the interests of local education and other school authorities, parents and students.(vi) He must control the provision of educational premises.3. The more important changes, so far recommended and accepted, inprocedures for control which are necessary for carrying out these dutiesare the following:  (i) The use of manuals of guidance will be extended. They should, forexample, give general guidance on principles to be observed indealing with matters which affect the rights of individuals, suchas the choice of a school, admission to secondary schools andthe employment of children in entertainments. Correspondenceon appeals would be greatly reduced if the Ministry and localeducation authority were each better informed about the prin-ciples on which the other is working and local education authori-ties will be invited to submit their general arrangements showinghow they have interpreted the guidance given in such manualsin the light of the conditions obtaining in their area.
(ii) In a number of instances the present requirements that individualsitems should be submitted for approval will be withdrawn entirelyor replaced by the submission of general arrangements or annualprogrammes. Examples of this are:  (a) Specific approval of detailed scales of fees for further education will no longer be required.(b) In the same field part-time day courses of a non-specialisednature will not need approval.(c) Approval will no longer be required for the retention of teachers in employment over the age of 65.(d) The character of the education provided in a school may,in future, be changed, e.g. from grammar to modern,without the Ministers prior approval.(e) Prior approval will no longer be needed for the employ-ment of any medical officer for the ascertainment ofcertain categories of handicapped pupils, although it will still be required before a medical officer can be emplyed to examine children for educational sub-normality incertain cases or for ineducability.(f) Approval will no longer be required before particular doctorsmay carry out a medical examination and treatment ofhandicapped children ascertained to be within certain categories.(g) The present system by which the Minister considers indi-individually all cases where education is to be providedotherwise than at school will be replaced by one wheregeneral control is exercised through annual estimates ofexpenditure.(h) The Ministers approval for any school meals equipment,heavy or light, will only be needed where a fixedschedule of normal standards is exceeded: otherwise the authority will merely have to certify that their orderscomply with the standards, as is the present system for light equipment.(iii) The present system of probation, whereby a report in respect ofevery teacher has to be made to the Minister in order to satisfyhim of the technical proficiency of the teacher in the first year of service, is being replaced by a new procedure, which willsubstantially reduce the administrative work involved, while re-taining the essential purposes which the period of probation is designed to serve.(iv) The system of prior approval for school health service arrange-ments will be replaced by a system under which information willbe given to the Ministry annually after the event. The Ministry&apos;sfunction will be limited to inspection and a general financial control exercised through an annual estimate. Approval will notbe required for the acquisition of any school medical equipment.As a result of the recommendations on building procedures (sub-paragraph (vi) below) the detailed control of school clinic building will practically cease.(v) In the acquisition of sites the stage of approval in principle will be cut out and the Minister will be prepared to give his directionthat planning permission shall be deemed to be granted whehformal approval is given to the acquisition of the site, instead of
at the final stage.* Permission given at this stage will besubject to the subsequent approval procedure of the Ministryrelating to building. /(vi) For building works, the present system of compiling annual pro-grammes for projects of  5,000 and over will be continued and programmes for works in connection with school meals will cover projects of  2,Q00 and over instead of  1,000 and over.It is the aim to reduce the Ministry&apos;s formal scrutiny of plans to a minimum so as to release the Minisf,ry&apos;s officers increasinglyfor informal consultation in the planning stages, for inspection ofcompleted buildings from the point of view of educational suit-ability, cost, and building technique and to undertake research:the Ministry will therefore revise and extend the guidance givento authorities on cost, standards of accommodation and per-formance and availability of building labour and materials. Inthe primary and secondary field (including special schools) the guidance will continue to include building regulations. In thefield covered by the building regulations the Ministry will, assoon as the revised regulations and other guidance have beenissued, limit their formal scrutiny of plans to covering planning permission* and exemption from building byelaws.(vii) Amending legislation should be introduced so that local educationauthorities instead of the Minister would make the articles ofgovernment for voluntary secondary schools and would not, as now, require his specific approval for the articles which they make for county secondary schools. The freedom of managers,governors and teachers would be secured if the Minister indicated a minimum of responsibilities to be exercised by them and ifmanagers or governors were given a right of appeal to him inthe event of a dispute.APPENDIX VMinistry of Town and Country Planning Sub-committee chairman: Dame Evelyn Sharp, D.B.E.Organisation and Administration PanelChairman : Mr. E. S. Hill, C.B. Convener:  Sir Howard Roberts,C.B.E., D.L. (Clerk of theLondon County Council).Technical Activities PanelChairman: Mr. D. P. Walsh, C.B.       Convener: Mr. E. H. Doubleday(County Planning Officer, Hert-staffordshire).Finance PanelChairman: Mr. A. B. Valentine,       Convener: Mr. R. S. McDougallC.B. (County Accountant, Hertford-shire).ORGANISATION AND administration. The consultations between local planning authorities and GovernmentDepartments, which precede the determination of applications for develop-ment, or which are essential to the preparation of the development plan,will be simplified.* This will not be required while the experiment recommended in&apos; paragraph 3 of theOrganisation and Administration section of the Town and Country Planning Sub-Com-mittee&apos;s report is in force (see Appendix V).
2. The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 should be amended to simplify the present scheme of tree preservation by substituting a rightof the owner to challenge an Order for the present obligation of local autfao-rities to obtain the Minister&apos;^ confirmation of the Order. Meantime theprocedure will be shortened to the minimum required by. the Act and theform of Orders will be simplified. As regards felling licences, there shouldbe close informal relations between Planning Officers and Area Officers ofthe Board of Trade, and local authorities should speed up their existingprocedure.3. The relevant regulations will, as an experiment, be modified so asto provide that planning permission shall be deemed to be granted in respectof any development by a local planning authority within its own area, it being understood that authorities will themselves bring to the Departmentsattention any cases of national interest or public controversy, and will beforeundertaking any development carry out such consultation with interested departments and other persons as would have been appropriate had thedevelopment been the subject of an application for permission made tothem. The Minister will retain the power to call for information aboutthe authority&apos;s proposals and to require the submission to him, in particular cases or classes of case, of a formal application for planning permission ;such an application will automatically be required in any case where thedevelopment would conflict with any direction under Article 6 of the general development Order restricting the grant of planning permission, or would,if the subject of an application, have been referred to the Minister in accord-ance with a direction under Section 15 of the Town and Country planning act, 1947. The present provisions relating to buildings of special archkec-tural and historic interest will be maintained.4. A working party has been set up to examine the range of applicationsfor permission dealt with by planning authorities and to make recommenda-tions as appropriate for extension of the classes of development which maybe carried out without the need for an express application.TECHNICAL ACTIVITIESI. In scrutinising development plans the Ministry will not duplicate thework of the technical staffs of local planning authorities, but will confine their attention, subject to the obligation to enquire into representationsreceived from members of the public, to the main features of the development plans.2. The Ministry will not insist on absolute uniformity of method in pre-paring development plans where alternative methods preferred by local planning authorities! will give the same results with a saving of time.3. Certain amendments were made to the draft Circular on Report of the survey.4. The information at present required by the Ministry in connection withthe areas defined in development plans as areas of comprehensive develop-ment is necessary and the Ministry should be given similar information when an authority wishes to have the Ministers view on the planning proposalsunderlying an application under Section 1 of the Town and Country Plan-ning Act, 1944.5. The Ministry will consider:  (i) The possibility of modifying the administration of the provisions.... -v.       of Circular 39 (Limitations on Land Acquisitions during the
Period of Restrictions) which at present obliges local authoritiesto carry out their acquisitions in a piece-meal fashion,(ii) The proposal that local authorities should be relieved of the need to defend their projects at inquiries at two separate stages, onceon declaration or designation and again on actual compulsory purchase.6. Local planning authorities should examine their organisations dealingwith development control in order to make sure that this work does not take up too much of the time of their technical staffs and divert resources fromthe longer-term duty of preparing a development plan.FINANCE1. With regard to the administration of Section 94 of the Town and country Planning Act, 1947 : (a) No special measures to ease the Ministry&apos;s control can usefully betaken in cases involving compensation arising out of planningactions of local authorities under Part III and Part VIII ofthe Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 or acquisition underSection 19, where the local authority is obliged to purchase landon refusal of permission to develop. In Section .19 cases con-firmation of the purchase notice requiring the local authority topurchase the interest in the land may, unless otherwise statedat the time, be taken as indicating approval in principle for grant.(6) In the case of acquisitions other than under Section 19, annualprogrammes (specifying the parcels of land proposed to be acquired, those which can be acquired by agreement, the pur-pose of the acquisition and the authority for it, together withestimates of the cost of acquisition, clearing and loss or gain) willbe submitted not later than 1st October for grant approval inprinciple where the size of the programme justifies that course,and once approved (or approved as amended) no further refer-ence need, save in exceptional circumstances, be made to theMinistry in respect of grant until the grant claim is submitted.(c) A single block consent to acquisitions by agreement under Section 40of the Act will be given for those items in the annual programmemarked for acquisition in that manner.(d) In the case of acquisitions submitted otherwise than as part of anannual programme, approval for grant will be given concurrently with the decision on the Compulsory Purchase Order or withthe application under Section 40 for consent to acquisition byagreement.2. The Ministry will in due course review the regulations on the adminis-tration of Section 93 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 (which provides for Exchequer grants in respect of acquisition and clearing inredevelopment areas) when adequate experience has been gained of theadministration of the section.3. The Ministry will in due course review the working of Section 19 ofthe Town and Country Planning Act, 1944 (as amended and embodied inthe Eleventh Schedule of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947), which requires the consent of the Minister to disposals of local authority land ;if experience shows that the system cannot be made to work satisfactorily,an opportunity will be sought to revise this section of the Act.
APPENDIX VIMinistry of Transport Sub-committee chairman: Mr. J. R. Willis, M.C. Convener: Mr. H. E. Lunn (CountySurveyor, East Sussex).I. Technical manuals and circulars will be flexible enough to allow forvarying works and site conditions and to encourage enterprise and experiment in new methods and materials.2. The examination of highway authorities&apos; improvements proposals sufo-mitted through qualified engineers will be confined to questions of policyand reasonable conformity- with good practice.3. Forecasts of work which it is proposed to carry out will be submittedannually.4. Claims for grant payment will be deemed to be a sufficient record of progress, but should foe submitted regularly.5. The definition of &quot; maintenance &quot; will be extended to include all worksunder an estimated cost of  5,000 at present defined as &quot;minor improve-ments &quot;, the definition of which will be correspondingly narrowed.6. Estimates for maintenance and minor improvements will in future be divided only as between the class of road, i.e., Class I, II or III; andall minor improvements, as newly defined, will foe scheduled with the location,type of work and total estimated cost for each individual minor improvement.7. Major improvements estimated to cost less than  5,000 will foe submitted on an annual schedule giving the location, type of work and total estimatedcost in respect of each scheme; the schedules will foe discussed between the divisional Road Engineer and the surveyor of the authority and any detailsrequired will foe kept to a minimum; approved schemes &quot;on this schedulewill be the subject of a single comprehensive grant for each class of road.8. Whereas at present grants towards works are not issued below aminimum of  10, this minimum will be increased to  20 in respect of anyone grant application, and the same limit will apply to claims in respectof some minor operations such as the provision and maintenance of speed limit signs and pedestrian crossings.9. Where work is to be carried out by contract, the obtaining and accept-ance of a suitable tender within the approved estimate, together with theexecution of the formal contract documents, will be the responsibility of the highway authority without further reference to the Ministry, provided that: -(a) Invitations to tender are by public advertisement.(b) A tender other than the lowest is not accepted without prior agree-ment by the Ministry.(c) The Ministry&apos;s standard conditions of contract are followed, anyvariations to be approved by the Ministry.(d) A copy of the accepted tender is sent to the Ministry.10. Local authorities will be empowered to erect at their discretion autho-.rised warning or informative traffic signs.II. Subject to general directions from the Minister and provision for appeal,county councils and county borough councils outside the London trafficarea should be empowered by legislation to make substantive Orders, withoutthe need for the Ministers confirmation, imposing &quot;no waiting&quot;, &quot;uni-lateral waiting&quot;, &quot;one-way working&quot; and weight restrictions.12. The law and procedure governing the permanent closure of highwaysand the erection of covered queue barriers should be simplified.
13. The Ministry is considering the possibility of simplifying the detailsrequired to be submitted with applications for proposed origin and destinationsurveys.14. In considering the improvement of the administration of highwaylighting in general, the Ministry should explore the possibility of modifyingtheir supervision of trunk road lighting which is assisted from the Road Fund.15. The Ministry will approach agent authorities to ascertain whether theycould undertake trunk road surveys or works before these are put in handby the Ministry.16. Half-yearly estimates of requirements of stone, slag and lime submittedby highway authorities will be abolished&apos;on the understanding that authorities will notify Divisional Road Engineers of any material variation of theirestimated requirements from the corresponding period of the previous year.17. The sub-committee is considering some matters further, such as thesimplification of trunk roads procedure (including the possibility of trans-ferring to agent authorities work in connection with the conveyancing ofland) and the amendment of forms consequential on acceptedrecommendations.APPENDIX VIIGrant Claims and Loan Sanction Procedure Sub-committee chairman : Mr. P. D. Proctor, C.B.       Convener: Mr. J. Lythgoe, C.B.E.(City Treasurer, Manchester).NOTE BY THE MAIN COMMITTEEOwing to the nature of this report it is, unlike those of other sub-committees, reproduced in full.. In endorsing it we wish to draw attentionto paragraphs 13 and 14, since here the sub-committee did not submitspecific recommendations to us. We take the view that the chief financialofficer is the most appropriate person to sign statements of claim for granton behalf of a local authority (paragraph 13). The view expressed by thedepartmental representatives in paragraph. 14, that the chief financialofficer should as a regular practice be given an opportunity to reviewcontract settlements either... before the technical officer (or professionaladviser) gives his final certificate or restrospectively, raises a question whichis solely the responsibility of each local authority. Nevertheless we commendto local authorities generally the procedure suggested in this paragraph,which we understand is already followed by many authorities. Whether the review takes place before or after the contract settlement, it is intended thatit should be concerned not with the technical aspects of. the contract but with the accuracy of the accounts. We feel in particular that it is undesirable that a local authority should take formal steps which would deny its chieffinancial officer the opportunity to comment on contract settlements atsome stage.REPORT OF THE GRANT CLAIMS AND LOAN SANCTIONPROCEDURE SUB-COMMITTEEI. introduction. We were invited to consider and to report to the Committeeon any questions falling within its terms of reference which related to theadministrative arrangements and procedure for grant claims and requests for loan sanction by local authorities ; and in particular to examine anumber of points raised in the reports of other sub-committees. . ,
II. ADMINISTRATION OF GRANTS2. An examination of the conditions and procedures under which grants are paid by Government Departments in aid of various local authority services reveals a considerable variety of practice between departments and in some cases between different services administered by a single department. This variety is in itself likely to waste manpower in two ways; first because many officers in the financial staffs of local authoritiesare concerned with the accounting workof several grant-aided services (as are also the District Auditors) and will therefore be obliged tbJ master andapply different rules for similar circumstances in different services; secondlybecause when a new grant-aided service is set up or when the grant regula-tions of an established service are under review, time is spent by seniorrepresentatives of loCal authorities and of Government Departments in discussion and negotiation of conditions and procedures for the paymentof grant which have already been settled and tried in other services.3. We therefore accepted as our first principle that greater uniformity of practice in these matters is desirable as an end in itself. With this inview, our intention has been to ensure that within the general framework of grant policy (with which we were not immediately concerned) the practiceshould as far as possible be standardized in a way which conformed withthe general principles set out in the Committee&apos;s Memorandum of guidance and which gave the greatest opportunity and encouragement for economies of manpower.4. In more detail our aims can foe summarised as follows : &apos;(a) to establish logical sequence, form, content and method of handlingin relation to statements of claim rendered by local authorities.In particular we felt that as a matter of orderly accounting state-ments of account in support of grant claims should form anordered series, recognisably linked (or at least easily reconcilable)with the main headings of the Annual Epitomes of Accountssubmitted by loCal authorities under the Local Government Act,1933, and thus ultimately with the annual Summary of LocalGovernment Financial Statistics.(6) To remove, as far as possible, minor points of difficulty which areliable to cause irritation and correspondence out of proportion to their importance.(c) To save time and energy in negotiating, on new services, grantconditions and other points already well settled in other services.id) To render unnecessary the arbitrary modification for grant purposesof well recognised accountancy practices. Grants should bepaid on 1 tlic basis of accounts prepared in a normal manner which the District Auditor is prepared to certify as showingthe actual expenditure incurred on the service under the con-trolling statutes, subject to the proposals discussed below;5. In order to achieve these aims we recommend that a set of general rules should be circulated to the Government Departments concerned withgrant-aided services, laying down for their guidance the standard conditionsof grant payment and procedures which should normally be adopted. we recognise that these rules may not in all respects be appropriate to thecircumstances of every case and that arrangements may be necessary, subjectto the normal consultation with local authorities, for Departments to divergefrom them in particular instances. But we hope that such exceptions neednot be numerous;
6. We have considered in some detail what the content of the proposedgeneral rules should be and our agreed* recommendations are summarised inthe draft heads for general rules set out in the Annex to this report. Themore important, questions which we considered in drawing up these heads are discussed in paragraphs 7 to 18 below.7. It should be made clear from the outset that the proposals embodied in the draft heads raise no new principles and, with one exception (para.12 (b) below), involve no practices with which local authorities are not already familiar. In fact our proposals will probably best be understood by those most concerned if we explain that they extend to grant-aidedservices generally the conditions of grant and procedures for grant claim and payment which are at present (and have for many years been) applied in the case of the main education grant. The chief characteristic of thissystem is that grant is calculated by the Department on the basis of a copy,certified by the District Auditor, of the local authority&apos;s own account, whichis supported by replies to a questionnaire from which the Department obtainsinformation or assurances on particular points affecting the financial con-ditions of grant. By eliminating the preparation by local authorities ofspecial accounts for grant claim purposes and the need for a variety of separate certificates to cover specific points, this system has been foundto be economical of labour in local authorities and Government Departmentsequally. There appears to be no reason why it should not be given general application with equal success.8. The local authority representatives have stressed, and we endorse thepoint unanimously, that this system can be expected to work smoothly and economically only if Departments use discretion in drawing up the question-naires and other necessary forms and bear in mind the need for keeping;them as simple as possible. Any Department which succumbed to the temptation to elaborate these forms by asking for information without,considering sufficiently closely whether it was really needed or sought to use them as a &quot; long-stop &quot; for some other form of control, would clearly belikely to frustrate the purpose of our recommendations. The questionnaireshould be confined to items which might affect the amount of expenditurerecognised for grant.9. We also recognise the importance of allowing local authorities as faras possible to run their own affairs and we think that Departments should exercise restraint in asking for detailed information in support of claims for grant additional to that obtained in the forms submitted for the purpose.In this context we took note of a suggestion made by one of the Othersub-committees that the District Auditors certificate should be accepted bygrant-paying Departments without further investigation of the detailed claim.We are unable to accept this suggestion. The certificate of the DistrictAuditor cannot alter the fact that the Minister concerned with a grant-aidedservi&quot;e is responsible to Parliament for the proper disbursement of the grant.It is tor this reason essential that the Minister (and the Department acting on his behalf) should continue to have the right to make enquiries beforeaccepting a grant claim. But as already stated we are agreed that inpractice it is desirable that such enquiries should be kept to a minimum andwe appreciate that the District Auditors certificate does greatly reduce theneed for them.10. We are agreed on the need for full consultation between departments and local authority representatives on any points of substance which arise in the drafting of grant regulations, claim forms, etc.   We recommend that* Subject to the points referred to in paras. 13 and 14 below.
Departments should be reminded of this important point when the proposedgeneral rules are circulated to them. The departmental representatives have in addition undertaken to make arrangements which will assist in main-taining uniformity of practice in these matters between Departments and facilitate the exchange of experience.11. Our discussions about conditions for grant centred particularly onthe admissibility for grant of appropriate proportions of the central adminis-trative expenses of local authorities. This is a matter in which there hasbeen a marked diversity of practice between (and within) Government Depart-ments and on which there seems to be an unanswerable case for greateruniformity. Our recommendations are summarised briefly in the draft headsfor general rules (Annex, para. 6). In making them it will be seen thatwe have accepted the general principle that all actual expenditure incurredfor the purpose of a grant-aided service should be admitted for grant, irres-pective of whether it relates to work which is decentralised and carried outin a separate department for that service or is carried out centrally inone of the general administrative departments of a local authority. Theadvantages of this principle are that it appears to us to be logical, thatit is in practice comparatively simple to administer, and that it takes account of the different types of local authority organisation and encourageslocal authorities to adopt whichever will toe most efficient and economical.12. The following points of explanation supplement the recommendations on this matter in the Annex :-(a) Salaries of central administrative staffWhile we are agreed that in accordance with the above principle anapportionment of the salaries and wages of staff in central departments should be admitted for grant, we felt that it would be inappropriate for grant to be paid on salaries of chief officers and their deputies (otherthan those appointed for the service in question) in the same way.&apos; This is a matter on which opinions have for long differed (and indeedMr. R. S. McDougall (County Accountant, Hertfordshire) was unable to share the majority view on this point) but bearing in mind that a localauthority is in most cases under a statutory obligation to appoint these officers, most of us felt that it would be out of keeping with the history and traditions of local government for grant to be claimed on the salaries of clerks of councils,, treasurers and other chief officers.(b) Joint use of buildings, land, etc.A suggestion was made by the local authority representatives that where a grant-aided, service occupies premises which are owned by alocal authority, grant should be paid on the true rental value of subhpremises whether or not there happened to be^outstanding debt on thebuildings. This submission was supported not only on the ground of equity, but also because such a charge was necessary to show the trueeconomic cost of the service. Further it often happened that some other service was thereby displaced for which alternative premises had to be(bought or rented. The departmental representatives felt unable to agreeto this suggestion in so far as it related to premises required for adminsitrative (as opposed to operational) purposes, since they main-tained that the suggested rental charge was a notional item of expenditure which did not correspond with any actual outgoings in the localauthority&apos;s books and that serious difficulties both of practice andprinciple would arise in examining and admitting claims of this type.The proposal on which we finally agreed (Annex, para. 6) is therefore in the nature of a compromise, based on the principle that grant shouldbe paid only on actual outgoings incurred.
(c) Supplementary allowances and gratuities under the Local GovernmentSuperannuation Act and equivalent local act powers the local authority representatives suggested that grant should bepaid on those supplementary allowances and gratuities which localauthorities have power to make, under the Local Government Super-annuation Act, 1937 and local act powers, to members of their staffswho do not qualify for pension rights. They claimed that this system had been deliberately framed by Parliament as an integral part of thelocal authorities&apos; code of conditions of service. Indeed in some casesaccount had been taken of the prospect of payments of this type in negotiating wages and conditions with Trade Unions. The departmentalrepresentatives recognised that there was force in this argument and agreed that, although the manpower at issue would not be substantial,this was a small point of irritation which could usefully be eradicated.We accordingly recommend (Annex, para. 6 (/)) that these payments should be recognised for grant.Certification of statements of claim13. It was proposed by the departmental representatives (Annex, para. 7)that as a general practice statements of claim for grant should be signed on behalf of the local authority by the chief financial officer. There is nodisagreement in the sub-committee on this point, but as the local authorityrepresentatives on the sub-committee have felt that they could not properlycommit their Associations on the matter, it is suggested that it can best beconsidered by the main Committee.Contract Settlements14. One further important question was raised by the departmental repre-sentatives which can probably best be considered by the Main Committee.This is the recommendation (Annex, para. 9) that as a standard practiceall proposed contract settlements should be reviewed by the chief financialofficer or his staff before the technical officer gives his final certificate.The local authority representatives on the sub-committee again felt that itwould be inappropriate for them to express a view on this proposal. Butthe departmental members strongly recommend the proposed arrangement(which is already provided for in the standing orders or financial regulations of many local authorities) as a matter of efficient organisation. They feelthat it is no more than a matter of common sense (and in no way, as hassometimes been suggested, derogatory to the competence or professionalstanding of technical officers) to suggest that the finance staff of a localauthority, to whom the handling of figures, contracts, etc., is a &quot;bread and butter&quot; task, may be able on occasions to detect points arising fromthe financial provisions of the contract which the technical staff concerned might excusably overlook. It is recognised that in a few of the largerauthorities such an arrangement might, owing to the sheer volume of thework, involve unacceptable delays and it is suggested that in such casesthe chief financial officer should have the right to carry out retrospectivereviews of contract settlements. The departmental members feel confident that if, as they hope, this proposal is endorsed by the Committee and receivesthe influential support of the local authority Associations, a reduction willbe secured in the number of cases which present difficulties each year inconnection with contract settlements.Application of proposed general rules to particular services15. Although we have been primarily concerned to draw up in outline a set of general rules for the guidance of Departments, attention should be
drawn to several points arising out of the application of these rules to individual services. The first relates to road fund grants made to localhighway authorities by the Ministry of Transport. Although in other services the charging of the overheads of the cost of works has usually been foundto provide the appropriate way of obtaining a basis for grant, in this casegrant-earning expenditure has always been confined broadly speaking tothe cost of works on the site. All establishment expenses and overheadcharges at stores and depots have been excluded; The local authority repre-sentatives consider that an appropriate charge for those overhead expenses,which are in the nature of works on cost, is a proper item of expenditure toinclude as part of the costs of works. The rates of grant were howeverrecently increased after consultation with local authorities on the under-standing that the existing basis would be continued. It would doubtless be reviewed if local authorities desired it, but until, in the light of such a review,new rates of grant are negotiated we do not suggest that there should be anysubstantial change in the existing arrangements. It will follow that certain parts of the proposed general rules (in particular most of paragraph of the Annex) will not be applicable to highway grants.16. Secondly, the administration of Section 93 of the Town and country planning Act, 1947 (which relates to grants for acquisition and clearing inredevelopment areas) was excluded from our consideration by the remit fromthe main Committee. We have accordingly taken no account of theadministration of this section in drawing up our proposals for general rules.17. It was suggested to us that the administration of grants in aid of electoral registration expenses under the Representation of the People Act,should be reviewed to see whether any simplification of the existing proceduresis possible. We have not been able to examine this matter in detail butwe recommend that the Treasury should be invited to discuss it with localauthority representatives with a view to applying the principles of the general rules.18. Finally we were specifically invited to consider a criticism that the examination of claims for grant on the rodent extermination service wasunnecessarily meticulous. We understand that the grant regulations relatingto this service are being revised in consultation with local authority repre-sentatives and we consider that the application of the proposed general rules should obviate the difficulties which have arisen in the past.Other matters referred to the Sub-Committee19. We also examined two further specific proposals which were referredto us from the reports of other sub-committees. The first of these wasa suggestion that the ban on charging to loan the wages, salaries, etc., ofpermanent employees should be removed. We are not able to agree thatthis ban should be completely lifted, but we understand that the rules onthis point will be revised by the Ministry of Health in the near future.20. We were also asked to examine a suggestion that there was unnecessaryduplication of audit between the District Auditors and the Area FinanceOfficers of the Ministry of Transport. We have been informed that as aresult of further enquiries made by the local authority representatives they wish to withdraw their recommendation on this point. We have accordinglynot pursued the matter further and have no recommendation to make on it.III. LOAN SANCTION PROCEDURE21. The second part of our task was to consider a number of commentsand proposals which had been put forward in the reports of other sub-
committees in connection with the loan sanction procedure. In doing this we felt obliged to restrict our review to the administrative proceduresinvolved and we did not therefore examine such major questions as thecourse of future policy with regard to local authority borrowing or thepossible replacement of the loan sanctioning procedure by other formsof control over capital development. We understand that in any casearrangements have been made independently for discussions to take place between representatives of central and local government on future policy withregard to the Local Authorities leans Act, 1945.22. In examining the existing procedure we felt able to base our general approach on the Memorandum of Guidance by the Committee. It is our view that this form of control over the raising of loans should beregarded primarily as a means of ensuring that local authorities bothindividually and collectively adopt a sound and proper policy with regardto incurring future liabilities for present capital development. We considerthat it is undesirable in principle and likely to be wasteful of administrativeeffort that the loan sanctioning procedure should be regarded as a secondarymeans or complementary method of central control.23. With this principle in mind, we have three main recommendations tomake: (a) Our first recommendation relates to those grant-aided services forwhich it is intended that capital development should be approvedby the Departments concerned on the basis of annual programmessubmitted to them by local authorities. We feel that since it isintended that, except in special cases, this approval should carry with it the Departments authority to proceed with the programme without further formal reference, the procedure would be madesimpler if each complete programme were normally covered bya single or &quot;block &quot; sanction, or by not more than two or three&quot; block &quot; sanctions where separation by loan periods is necessary.This system has already been adopted with success in the housingschemes of some of the larger local authorities and we thinkthat it could well be given wider application. There should as aresult be a saving of manpower both in local authorities (someof which at present make as many as 150 or 200 individual appli-cations for loan sanction each year) and in the Government De^-partments which have to scrutinise them. We recognise that the suggested system will involve some practical complications. Forexample since local authorities are frequently unable for various reasons to complete the whole of their programmes in the yearintended, it would be necessary in such cases to adjust the appro-priate part of the block sanction in the programme and sanctionsof the following year, or in some other way. A more practical difficulty may perhaps be the peak load which will fall on theGovernment Departments concerned at the period when annualprogrammes are received. But we do not think that this difficulty,which is to some extent inherent in any system of annual pro-grammes, should prove insuperable. Under the suggested pro-cedure it would for various reasons be necessary that the stepsof obtaining Treasury consent to borrow under the Control of borrowing Order, 1947, and of approval for loans to be borrowedfrom the Public Works Loan Board, which are at present com-bined with the sanctioning of the loan in a single operation,should be taken separately at a later stage. Here again we feel sure that a simple and expeditious procedure can be devised.
One corollary of the new procedure suggested would be to abolish the present system whereby the London County Councilacts under statute as loan-sanctioning authority for most servicesof the Metropolitan Borough Councils (the Ministry of Healthacting for the remainder). The essence of loan control is thatthe power should be vested, in an authority which can review thetotal effect of the debt obligations being undertaken by the localauthority and by similar local authorities; and the present arrangement in London, which dates from 1855, is an anomaly.Moreover application for loan consent is not infrequently accom-panied by application for a compulsory purchase order, whichagain is a matter for the Ministry of Health. We recommend,therefore, that at the earliest suitable opportunity legislation should be introduced to transfer to the Ministry of Health theloan-sanctioning powers of the London County Council. Pendingsuch legislation it might be possible for these powers to betransferred under an agreement.(b) Our second recommendation is that the normal arrangement shouldbe such that approval of a capital project by the department concerned with its merits and responsible for any grant, should carry with it a guarantee of loan sanction from the Ministry ofHealth. It would follow that, as recommended by another sub-committee, the loan application should in all cases be addressedto the Department concerned with the merits. This would makeuniversal a procedure which already operates over a large partof the field (education, highways, etc.). This is primarily a matter for administrative arrangement between the Departments con-cerned and we do not anticipate that it should cause any seriouspractical difficulties.(c) Our third recommendation is that block sanctions might also be givenfor a wide range of projects on non-grant-aided services for whichthe system of annual programmes of capital development has not hitherto been thought appropriate. We suggest that local authori-ties might put forward each year programmes of miscellaneousitems for which block sanctions could be granted. Such a scheme would clearly be inapplicable to a number of projects of a majorcharacter which require individual consideration by reason of technical or other abnormal circumstances, and for them indi-vidual applications would still have to be made. But the Ministryof Health has undertaken to examine this proposal sympatheti-cally with a view to simplifying the present procedure on theselines.Signed on behalf of the Sub-committeeP. D. Proctor.J.
