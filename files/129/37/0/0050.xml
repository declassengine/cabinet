I10TH DECEMBER,  1949CABINETBEOHUAKALAND PROTECTORATE:  SUCCESSION TOCHIEFTAINSHIP OP THE BAMANGWATO TRIBEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations in the memorandum which I circulated on 19th July(CP. (49) 155) I explained-the problem which had arisen fromthe marriage to an English girl of Seretse Khama, the ChiefDesignate of the Bamangwato tribe in the Bechuanaland Protec-torate.     At their meeting on 21st July (C. M. (49) 47thConclusions, Minute 8), the Cabinet decided that a judicial enquiry should be held into,the circumstances attending theelection of Seretse Khama as Chief and that the terms ofreference of the enquiry should be drawn up by the LordChancellor, the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for theColonies and myself.2. The Judicial enquiry was duly constituted under the bechuanaland Native Administration Proclamation and consists ofSir Walter Harragin, C M* G. , K. C. , Judge of the High Court ofBasutoland. the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland(President), Mr. R. S. Hudson, C. M. G. , African Studies Branch,Colonial Office, and Mr.  G. E. Nettleton, C. B. E. , GovernmentSecretary of the Bechuanaland Protectorate.3- After consulting the High Commissioner for.Basutoland,the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, the following terms of reference were agreed:-&quot;(1)   To report whether the kgotla held at Serowe betweenthe 20th and 25th June, 1949? at vrtiich SeretseKhama was designated as Chief of the Bamangwatotribe, was properly convened and assembled, andits proceedings conducted in accordance with nativecustom.(2)   To report on the question whether, having particular regard to the interests and well-being of the tribe,Seretse Khama is a fit and proper person to dis-charge the functions of Chief. &quot;4. The Commission of Enquiry, which began taking evidence on 1st November, has now concluded its hearing and is at present engaged in preparing the report.      Sittings were held at Serowe(the capital of the Bamangwato Reserve), and also at Lobatsi inorder to take evidence from the Regent, Chief Tshekedi, who refused to go to Serowe on the plea that his life would been dangered thereby. &apos;

5195. It is hoped that the report will be available very shortly.      In view of the strength of feeling in the/Union ofSouth Africa and in Southern Rhodesia against the recognitionof Seretse Khama. as Chief, I thought that when deciding uponthe action to be taken as a result of the report it would be aswell that Sir Evelyn Baring, the High Commissioner forBasutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, shouldbe available for consultation, and I have accordingly arranged for his return to this country.      He is due to arrive on 12thDecember..     Sir Evelyn Baring feels, and I agree with him, thathe ought to return to his post in time to be on the spot duringthe crucial period immediately after an announcement is made about the recognition or non-recognition of Seretse.6. The information available to me indicates that the,situation in the Bamangwato Reserve is as satisfactory as canbe expected.     There have been no disturbances, but the HighCommissioner reports that the influence of Chief Tshekedi is ;waning fast and there have been signs, of increasingly openhostility to him.      Tshekedi has ruled with a very firm handand the prospect of getting,rid of him may well be a powerful,factor in the stxpport given by the tribe to Seretse Khama.7&apos; This memorandum is circulated for information only:;I will, of .course, consult my colleagues when the report is received and I have had an opportunity of discussing it with sir Evelyn Baring.P.
