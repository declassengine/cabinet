. .3503 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E 0 R E TQ.?.(49). 236 COPY NO. 3122ND NOVEMBER,  1949CABINETRETAIL TRADE wages memorandum by the Minister of Labour and. National service in CP. (49) 173 of 8th August I submitted to theCabinet tho question of approving the wages regulation proposalsof   the eight &quot;Wages Councils for the retail distributive trades.Originally, at their meeting on 12th August (CM.(49) 52nd&apos;Conclusions, Minute 1), the Cabinet decided that those proposals should not be confirmed and invited me to bring before them anyrevised proposals that might be submitted in future.   Subsequently,at thoir meeting on 29th August (CM. (49) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 2),the Cabinet reversed their earlier decision and authorised me to approve the proposals at intervals over the next few weeks.Following this revised decision, I made Wages Regulation orders to give effect to tho proposals of six of the Wages Councils..2. The Retail Drapery. Outfitting and Footwear TradesWages Council (Great Britain), one of the two outstanding, havenow re-submitted their proposals without change in the rates.The employers&apos; side, however, made strong representations thatthe cut in retailers&apos; margins recently imposed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade made it impossible for them to agree any increase of wages involved in the proposals.   In the circumstances thought it necessary to see separately all three elements of the Wages Council,  the employers&apos;  side, the Trade Union side and the independent members.3. At these discussions, the employers&apos;  representativesopposed confirmation of the rates proposed, while the v/orkors&apos;representatives equally pressed for confirmation.    The Chairman,on behalf of the independent members,  represented to me thatthe two sides of the Council had agreed tho rates in June andthe independent members felt that they were reasonable havingregard to changes in the cost of living.   Further, the rates worecomparable with those fixed for other retail trades, and the indo-Pendcnt members felt that all the &quot;Wages Councils should be dealtwith on a comparable basis and that it would be unreasonable to approve all but this one.    (There would in fact be two, as explained below.)    The independent members felt that the implementation of the proposals v/ould not cause seriousdisturbance to the machinery of distribution, and that, on theother hand,  in view of the comparable rates being paid in otherretail trades, there would be disturbance if the proposals werenot confirmed.4. Having heard the views of tbe two sides and havingregard particularly to the views expressed by the independent members, I am in no doubt that in normal circumstances thiswould be a case in which I should confirm the proposals.    Thequestion arises, however, whether the Cabinet authority of-1-

29th August (referred to in paragraph 1 above) extends to any proposals from this Council and,from the Furnishing and AlliedTrades Wages Council, which has been much behind the others in its deliberations and which only as recently as 1stNovember has submitted its proposals as a result of a unanimous resolution of the Council.5, The rates provided by these two sets of proposalsfit in with those provided by the Orders I have already madefor the other sections of the retail trades under the cabinet authority of 29th August.      Indeed, there are instances wherethe rates in these proposals are lower than the correspondingrates in the Orders.      Whether judged by reference to therates fixed for the lowest class of labour in the older wages councils (Trade Board) Trades/,  or by reference to the presentcost of living, the rates proposed, which are set out in tfee-        annexe^ kab-3re, are on a modest scale.6. I realise, of course, that notwithstanding any decision reached before 18th September,  it is highly necessarythat any proposals now received should be considered in the wider context of our discussions on a standstill for wages.The arguments against confirmation as I see them are asfollows.7/&apos;. These proposals are bound to be described as wage increases, even although in fact only a small percentage ofworkers will be affected, and the proposals do no more than con-firm the voluntary rates already in existence in the largerstores and undertakings.      Opponents of the wage restraintpolicy may point to these cases as showing that the Governmentwill not themselves take the responsibility for enforcing a standstill and that in any case the fact that these Orders aremade will show that the restraint, even if the government desire it, is not absolute,8. It may also be urged that this is not the time to embark on another-large field of wage regulation when clearly the existence of full employment is sufficient to guarantee the workers their rates,9- Despite these arguments, I am of the opinion thatthis case and that of the Furnishing and Allied Trades can be,and should be, treated as exceptional and as being outside thequestion of general wage stabilisation.      These, as already pointed out, formed two of the eight trades whose cases were considered by the Cabinet in August, and they form a part ofthe complete pattern of the retail distributive trades.There is no doubt in my mind that the decision of principle which the Cabinet took on 29th August applied to these two asto the other six trades.      It is only an. accident of time thatthe reconsidered proposals have become available after 18thSeptember rather than before that date.      I am satisfied,therefore, that those proposals can be dealt with and the implementation of the Cabinet decision of principle of 29thAugust completed without prejudice either to the generalstabilisation policy or to the treatment which, within that policy, is to be accorded to the lower paid workers.10. The alternative to confirming the proposals will beto leave two sections of the workers employed in retail distri-bution without the safeguard which has now been afforded tothe other six sections.      If the proposals are not confirmed,a serious breach will have been made in the policy of providingsafeguards to the lower paid unorganised workers in retail distribution which otherwise would have been completed as aresult of the Government*s action since 1945.

11. When I originally saw the Trades- Union Congress onthis matter, I asked them especially whether their policy of wage restraint would be impeded by confirming Orders for theseretail -wages proposals.      I was assured that on the contraryit would be of assistance.      I understand that, on the issueof now confirming the rates proposed by the Retail Drapery andthe Furnishing Trades Councils, the Trades Union Congress takethe view that it would be the completion of a process of wageregulation for the retail trades that has been going for some 1considerable time and that, while the timing is rather awkward,there is no alternative to confirmation.      To refuse to con-firm would,  in their view, create greater difficulties thanconfirmation.12. During the period of stabilisation difficult questions of confirmation of Wages Councils proposals will doubtless arise and will have to be considered in relation tothe stabilisation arrangements.      Until it is known precisely,what these arrangements are I am not in a position to putforward proposals for dealing with this aspect of wages policy.13. ;ss regards the immediate issue, I am of opinion thatI should confirm the proposals of these two retail wages councils without delay, whilst at the same time making itclear that in doing so 1 am simply finally implementing adecision of principle taken by the Cabinet in August andcompleting the work of establishing wage regulation for retail distribution.G.
