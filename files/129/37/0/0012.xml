this document IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet   October 1949 -SECRET Copy No.    31CP. (49) 21221st October, 1949CABINETSOVIET  INTENTIONS  TOWARDS  YUGOSLAVIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recently instructed my Department to examine the question of Sovietintentions towards Yugoslavia. I now circulate for the information of my col-leagues the conclusions reached and a summary of the arguments on which theyare based.Conclusions(a) The Soviet Government regard the disappearance of Tito as more andmore urgently necessary and they have probably made fresh plans within the last few weeks in order to bring this about.(b) These plans are likely to include the active promotion of rebellion in Yugo-slavia, but to stop short of actual armed intervention by the Red Army.(c) The possibility of intervention by the Red Army at some later stage cannotbe entirely excluded, though there are no signs of preparations for an attack at tbemoment.(d) The Yugoslav economic position is more precarious than we had previous-ously thought, but Tito, nevertheless, has a good chance of surviving the winter and, if he does this, nothing short of actual invasion is likely to shake him.ArgumentThe destruction of the Tito heresy has become a matter of supreme importanceto the Soviet Government. Though the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism teachthem that all situations inevitably turn to their advantage in the long run, they arenot likely to be content simply to await the results of the pressure which they havebeen exercising against Yugoslavia during the past fifteen months. Still less is it likely that they will withdraw from the course on which they are set.The probability is that the Soviet Government realised in the course of last summer that they had misjudged the position and that Tito would not come to heelor succumb simply as a result of economic and propagandist pressure. Theirfresh plans certainly include the intensification of the political war of nervesthrough such measures as the denunciation of the treaties of friendship betweenYugoslavia and the satellites, the virtual suspension of diplomatic relations andthe trumping up of charges, against the Yugoslav Government, of territorialdesigns on Hungary and Albania. These political cards have by now nearly all been played and the threat to resort to &apos;&apos; more effective means &apos;&apos; which was con-tained in the Soviet note to Yugoslavia of 18th August is only intelligible on the assumptions either that (a) they intend to attack Yugoslavia or (b) they are confident of an anti-Tito putsch.If the Russians are confident of an anti-Tito putsch, it is difficult to see whatgrounds they have for such confidence. It is just as difficult for an illegal oppo-sition to organise itself successfully in Yugoslavia as in any other totalitariancountry. The army is said to be loyal, the security police are competent and37738
Tito&apos;s popularity is thought to have grown rather than diminished. On the otherhand, Tito&apos;s economic position is known to be bad and it seems likely that this knowledge will encourage the Soviet Government to try to engineer internal risingsbefore they embark on any more open kind of intervention. 0If no rebellion has occurred by next spring the Soviet Government are not likely to be deterred from invading Yugoslavia by regard for world opinion. Thishas never deterred the Soviet Government from anything upon whichthey have set their mind and they would have no difficulty in reconcilingaction against Yugoslavia with their pose of being the champions of world peace. A more likely deterrent is the fear of provoking a generalconflict. They might, however, be reasonably confident that they could take military measures without serious risk of Western armed intervention.The larger the scale of the invasion and the sooner the operations were brought toa conclusion, the smaller the risk would be. We might expect, therefore, that ifthe Soviet Government decide that the Red Army must be used they will mount afull-scale invasion.There are no signs whatever of preparations for an imminent attack by theRed Army and it seems likely that before the Soviet Government decide to commit the Red Army they will pursue a policy of steadily increasing pressure, includingthe infiltration of armed bands to provoke local disturbances.E.
