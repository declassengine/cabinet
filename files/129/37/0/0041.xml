Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1949SECRETCP. (49) 241 (Revise)12th December, 1949cabinetRECOGNITION OF STAFF ASSOCIATIONS IN THE POST office memorandum by the Postmaster general statement of Problem1. I am faced with a difficult and urgent problem concerning official recog-nition of staff associations in the Post Office upon which I should welcome theadvice of my colleagues. On the one hand, four new breakaway associations are seeking recognition (see Appendix A), at least one of which (the EngineeringOfficers&apos; (Telecommunications) Association) has probably already fulfilled the numerical requirement for recognition on the existing basis; on the other hand the two largest recognised associations, the Union of Post Office Workers and thePost Office Engineering Union, have challenged the existing basis of recognitionon the ground that it encourages the growth of breakaway bodies, and they urgemodification. My difficulty is that if I cede the new associations&apos; claim I run aserious risk of losing the established associations&apos; co-operation in promoting pro-productivity, to which I attach the greatest importance; if I refuse, I expose myself toa charge of breach of faith. This matter has already been raised by Question inthe House (see the extracts from Hansard reproduced in Appendix B); the adjournment Debate of which notice was given has hot however taken place. .Background and policy . The present policy governing the recognition of staff associations in thePost Office was formulated by my predecessor in 1946, following a claim from theUnion of Post Office Workers for sole recognition for all rank-and-file manipula-tive grades. The full text of the Postmaster GeneraPs statement, which is repro-duced in Appendix C, was published early in 1947 in the Whitley Bulletin and in several Post Office staff association journals. It had long been the Post Officepractice to regard about 40 per cent, membership of the organised staff of a gradeor grades as a requirement for the consideration of claims to recognition; butthis was the first occasion on which a definite figure was quoted, and since then the so-called &quot; Listowel formula&quot; has obtained general currency. Despite the reservations attached to it, this formula is widely interpreted as automaticallyentitling an association to official recognition as soon as it can establish that itcomprises 40 per cent, of the organised membership of the grade or grades whichit represents.3. The Union of Post Office Workers and the Post Office Engineering Unioncriticise the policy and, in particular, its application on the basis of an individualgrade. They urge that the proper unit for recognition purposes should be a group of related grades, e.g., the rank-and-file engineering grades as a whole, and the rank-and-file manipulative grades as a whole. Their proposal is of course designedto reduce the chance of any n^ew association securing recognition in a field already covered by an existing recogmsepl association.Possible Courses of Action4.   There are, I think, three main courses open to me : (i) I can act on the previous conception of the Listowel formula, recognisenew associations as and when they prqve that they have the requisite[37917]   37995 &quot; copy No.31
proportion of membership under that formula, and accept the hostilityof the existing recognised associations to this decision, with all theconsequences involved.(ii) I can restate Post Office policy on recognition of new associations,but grant recognition to any new associations which have alreadyfulfilled the numerical requirements set out in the Listowel. formulabefore the change is made.(iii) I can restate Post Office policy on recognition of new associations andapply the new criteria currently to all associations not now recognised,whether or not they have already fulfilled the numerical requirementsof the Listowel formula.Consideration of First Course5. The first course would go a long way towards satisfying the Parlia-mentary Opposition. It would, however, arouse bitter resentment on the part ofthe Union of Post Office Workers, the Post Office Engineering Union, the Post.Office Controlling Officers&apos; Association and possibly, to a lesser extent other asso-ciations on the Staff Side of the two Post Office Whitley Councils (engineering and non-Engineering). The repercussions of staff co-operation on productivitycannot be forecast with certainty, but in my opinion we should have to face thewithdrawal of staff co-operation in improving productivity in the Post Officethrough the Joint Production Committees which have been functioning for some two years On the engineering side, and the Joint; Production Council and localCommittees which have been established within the last few months on the mani-pulative side. It is already clear beyond doubt that the Unions have entered upontfiie productivity campaign vnth a genuine and strenuous determination to achieveresults^ and; tfie conversion of this goodwill into hostility would have incalculableresults on the prospects of the Post Office making its proper contribution to national recovery. It would also react in the sphere of wage claims, where somuch depends at the moment upon Union restraint. For these reasons I do not favour this course.Consideration of Second Course6. Under the second course I should propose to Jeaye myself the maximumfreedom for the future, and I set out in Appendix E the terms in which I should propose to formulate my new policy. (These terms have been agreed in discussion at the official level with the Treasury, Ministry pf Labour and Ministry of Health.)This course ought, I think, to give a considerable degree of satisfaction to theUnion of Post Office Workers, which isi the most influential of the three existingunibns concerned and potentially the most effective in the productivity sphere,since the. Unidh could justifiably&quot; regard it as likely to give them some safeguard against&apos; recognition of the National Association Of Postal and Telegraph Officers.Also I should obviate by this means any accusation of sharp practice towardsthe associations which had already fulfilled the numerical requirements of theListowel formula, and by doing this I should take away much of the force Ofthe criticism of the Opposition: I should no doubt still have to face the aceusa-tion that I was taking away a safeguard which had hitherto existed for theprotection of minorities. The answer which \ I should make is that there is nothing in the terms of my new policy which justified such an accusation.   ;7. The serious objection to this course is that it would involverecognising the Engineering Officers&apos; (Telecommunications) Association,a breakaway from the Post Office Engineering Union, and would thusincur the forfeiture of any hope of co-operation or goodwill on the partOf that Union; ! Indeed, coming as it would &quot;on top of the rejection ofthe Uhiotffs recent wage claim, it could not&apos; fail to produce the greatest bitter-&quot;hess and would furnish another ground for unfavourable contrast with the treat-ment meted but&apos;to the larger and more powerful Union of Post Office Workers. Itwould also play into the hands of those elements in the Post Office engineering union which would like to see the Union take a more aggressive and hostile line.Further, it would involve the inconsistency that, on the one hand, we should bejustifying the line we are taking on the ground of the importance of. co-operationwith the Post Office Staff as a whole, while, on the other hand, by recognising the Engineering Officers&apos;  (Telecommum^ should bediscarding the prospect of such ,cd-operation oh the engineering side.
Consideration of the Third Course 18. By adopting the course I should expect to retain the goodwill andco-operation of the existing recognised unions a factor of paramount importancein the present critical position of the country-in the field of productivity, thetreatment of wage claims, and negotiations generally. Nevertheless, I do notunderrate the difficulty involved in following this course or the strengthof the criticism I should have to meet from, the Parliamentary Opposition.Not only would &quot;they criticise my statement of policy as taking away theexisting safeguard for minority rights; they would also accuse hie of : a breach of faith towards the new associations, particularly towards theEngineering Officers&apos; (Telecommunications) Association, whose claihi-so far; as numbers are concerned-would have already been virtually siib-stantiated before the change was made. The question of. minority rights is dealt with iii paragraph 6. I could also put forward a reasoned defence againstthe accusation of breach of faith. In the first place, I could point to the quaiifica-tion attached to the Listowel formula that it was &quot; subject to the prevailingcircumstances on any occasion being similar to those obtaining to-day,&quot; ahacould stress that the circumstances have, in fact, materially changed.5 Secondly,I could emphasise the reference to this aspect of the matter in the correspondence between the Post Office and the Engineering Officers&apos; (Telecommunications)Association.  I could point out that (a) nearly four weeks after publication of the Listowel formula in thePost (the journal of the Union of Post Office Workers) and someten days after its publication in another Post Office association journal,the Engineering Officers&apos; (Telecommunications) Association wrote tothe Post Office asking for &quot;information regarding the rules and regulations concerning the granting of . . recognition,&quot; thusclearly indicating that, if they were relying oh the Listowel formula,they did not regard the 40 per cent, criterion as justifying automaticrecognition; in reply the Post Office wrote on 17th February, 1947,that &quot;no precise rules concerning the grant of recognition are laiddown, but that, as a result of a recent review of the general arrange-ments . . . ., the Postmaster General will not be prepared to considerrequests for recognition from an association unless it can show thatit has in membership at least 40 per cent. . . . .&quot; and        ,   ;(b) in a letter dated 27th August, 1949, in which I offered to reconsider their claim Jn the light of membership figures at the end of 1949, I made it clear that this was proposed on the assumption that &quot; in themeantime there is no change in regard to the principle on which the grade is used as a, basis for considering claims by staff associations to official recognition &quot;; this specific proviso was inserted in the secondletter because, at that time I had received notice that the Union of post Office Workers desired to renew their demand for a change ofpolicy.&apos;Thirdly, and more generally, I could insist on the principle that, whatevernumerical or other conditions are laid down as a pre-requisite to the considerationof any claim for recognition, the decision whether or not to recognise must alwaysrest upon the Ministers discretion. In this connection, I should point out that under the Listowel formula, apart altogether from the possibility of a changeof policy, 40 per cent, membership merely gave entitlement to &quot;consideration.&quot;Critics may seek to refute my argument by reference to the Treasury pamphleten &quot;Staff Relations in the Civil Service.&quot; (Appendix D-see particularly thesecond sentence) The answer which I should make is that this pamphlet onlypurports to give an outline of present policy; it does not, of course, abrogate thepower of Ministers to make changes after proper consultation when due cause isshown.Conclusion &apos;. ,  ; &apos; &apos;&apos;...,9. Of the three courses available I favour the third. Serious difficultiesattach to ali three, but the third course seems to me to be the one most fitted .tothe over-riding national needs of the present time. It offers, as I have explained,room for charges of bad faith, but I consider that they can be resisted. If mycolleagues agree that the defence which I have outlined in paragraph 8 would justify this course at the bar of public opinion, I would propose to follow it.37995 B 2
10. In that event, I would propose to afford the Staff Sides of the national and Departmental Whitley Councils an opportunity to comment on myJ revisedpolicy, as shown in Appendix E. 1 think that it would be accepted by the PostOffice Staff side, but from informal conversation with the Chairman of theNational Staff Side it seems that there may be difficulty in that quarter on theground that the completely wide terms of the new policy are quite inconsistent with the formula governing recognition in the Civil Service set out inEstacode N (a) 3 (reproduced in Appendix F), which says in so many words thatDepartmental recognition depends on the size of membership in the grades orclasses concerned within a Department; and that they may object to the proposed policy unless they can have an assurance that while this is to be the basis of recognition in the Post Office it is not to be imposed outside the Post Office. Ishould propose to give no decision on the E.O. (T.) A. claim until the check of membership figures has been carried out at the end of this year, as already arranged. I nave every reason to think that, when this membership figure hasbeen checked and weighed against the other considerations now specifically set outin my new statement of policy, I shall reach the conclusion that the Association^claim for recognition must be rejected.W.

Boyd-Caryenter asked the Postmaster General whether he has con-;; sidered the application submitted to him on 8th October, 1949, by theEngineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association; and whether, inview of the fact that the membership of this association exceeds! 40 percent, of the total of organised staff in the technical officers: grade, he proposes to grant recognition to this association. .Mr, Wilfred Paling: . . &apos;(When this Association^ earlier claim for recognition was rejected on27th August last, they were informed that the matter would be reconsidered inthe light of membership figures at the end of the year, assuming that in the mean-time there was no change in the principle on which claims for recognition were considered. Iam at present reviewing the basis on which recognition by the PostOffice should be given to new staff associations and pending a conclusion of thatreview I regret I am not in a position to take a decision on the present claim.Mr. Boyd-Carf enter: Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether the claim ofthe association referred to in my Question establishes that they now number 40 percent, of the organised members of this grade,&apos; and has not that figure previously been treated as entitling anybody to recognition ?Mr. Paling: They have made a claim to that extent, but with regard to thefigures only, I must examine the claim of the other union also. .,Mr. W. J. Brown: Inasmuch as the existing rules governing recognition, inwhich the 40 per cent, level figures have operated very satisfactorily for a verylarge number of years in the Post Office, can the Postmaster-General tell us what he has in mind in saying that he is contemplating a revision of those rules?Mr. Paling: The question of the multiplicity of unions brings in its traindifficulties for the Post Office itself also, and I should like to examine the question in the light of the difficulties.Mr. Quintin Hogg: At all events, will the right hon. Gentleman give us an assurance that his review is not being undertaken for the exclusion on political grounds of a union whose basis of membership is otherwise adequate for recognition ?Mr. Paling: I am undertaking this review in the interests of the Post Officegenerally and of the men themselves.Hon. Members: Oh !Mr. Boyd-Carpenter: Is it not a fact that this! organisation now numbers40 per cent, of the members in the grade, and that the rule granting recognition insuch cases is still in effect? On those two assumptions, can - the right, hon.Gentleman say why recognition is now refused, even if the matter is to be reviewed again. &apos;:Mr Gallacher: It is a Communist union. (Amended 17th November : &quot;Itis not a Communist union.&quot;)Mr. Paling: I have already said that, the union has made that claim.   At themoment I am not disputing their figures  1      ;&apos; Mr. Boyd-Carpenter:The right hon.

APPENDIX C:;     .:. &quot;The Listowel Formula&quot;(Extract from Post Office letter to the Union of Post Office Workersdated 30th December, 1946)&quot;As the Union will have realised, consideration of its claim for solerecognition has involved a general review of the arrangements for grantingrecognition to staff associations, and the Postmaster General has considered thematter very carefully in the light of present-day developments. He sees noreason at present for departing from the policy hitherto pursued of considering a request for recognition from an association if it can show that it has in member-ship at least 40 per cent, of the organised staff of the grade or grades concerned.For the future, however, he has decided that the Department should also adoptas a guiding rule that where an association warrants recognition this should begranted for an initial period of three years; at the end of that period, or at anytime subsequently, the question of i withdrawing recognition will arise if the membership falls below 33J per cent.. of the organised staff of the grade. Thequestion of restoring recognition once withdrawn will not be considered untilthe lapse of three years from the date;of withdrawal; The foregoing is, of course,always subject to the prevailing circumstances on any given occasion being similarto those obtaining to-day.&quot;r,\i\ .i\      &apos; ! -  &apos;     &apos; :    Note      &apos;      , &apos; -S&apos;&quot;&apos;--The letter containing the above paragraph was reproduced in full in the Post,the journal of the Union of Post Office Workers, of 4th January, 1947, and in the9th November, 194966.   Mr. Boyd-Carpenter asked the Postmaster General, when he abrogatedthe rule of his department entitling associations of workers numbering40 per cent, of the organised workers in a grade to recognition; and in what form and to whom this abrogation Was communicated.Mr. Wilfred Paling :I have not abrogated any rule. As I recently informed the hon. and gallantmember. I am reviewing the whole situation.Mr. Boyd-Carpenter : May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if it is not a factthat this rule has existed for some time in his Department, and that notwithstand-ing that, he has refused to apply it, though he accepts the figures in the case ofthe Engineering Officers Telecommunications Associations? Can the right hon.Gentleman.therefore distinguish between abrogating a rule and not applying itwhen it is politically inconvenient.-Mr. Paling : It is true that the rule has been in operation a long time andalso that circumstances have cropped up which make it possible to review it.Mr. Quintin Hogg : Is not it a fact that the only circumstance which croppedup was the desire of the right hon. Gentleman to suppress a union not of his ownliking? :,Mr. Henry Strauss : Whatever may be the inconvenience of dealing with several unions, will it not cause far more inconvenience if the right hon. Gentle-man refuses recognition to a trade union which represents 40 per cent, of theworks concerned?Mr. Paling : That remains to be seen.,   Mr. W.J. Btown: May I ask in what respect conditions have changed as*betwieen the date when this scheme of recognition of 40 per cent, was adopted byagreement within the Post Office and the conditions to-day ? In what respect hasthere been any change whatever?Mr. Paling : A lot of conditions have changed in the last twenty years.Mr. Boyd-Carpenter: I beg to give notice, in view of the fact that the non-application of this long-standing rule in one particular case really requires further investigation, that I shall endeavour to raise the matter on the Adjournment.
Whitley Bulletin for February 1947. A similar passage was included in letterssent to other associations, which were reproduced in the following associationjournals: The Counter Clerk (Association of Counter Clerks and Telegraphists) ofJanuary 1947;The Postal Telegraph (Guild of Postal Sorters) of January 1947; andThe Telephonist (National Guild of Telephonists) of February 1947.APPENDIX D(Extract from &quot; Notes on Government Organisation No. 7, Staff Relations in theCivil Service &quot;)To secure recognition an association must show that it is representative ofthe category of staff concerned. In the Civil Service recognition depends solely on numerical strength. The Postmaster General has recently announced that thePost Office will consider a request for recognition if the association making therequest can show that it has in membership at least 40 per cent, of the organisedstaff of the grade or grades concerned; that where an association warrantsrecognition by the Post Office this will be granted for an initial period of threeyears; that at the end of that period or at any time subsequently the questionof withdrawing recognition will arise if the membership falls below 33J per cent,of the organised staff of the grade; and that the question of restoring recognitiononce withdrawn will not be considered until the lapse of three years from thedate of withdrawal. The Treasury has never announced any precise percentageswhich would establish a claim to national recognition or raise the question of with-drawing national recognition, and considers each claim on its merits. Where,,however, there are conflicting claims, actual or potential, steps are taken toascertain fully-paid-up membership figures before recognition is granted: ifnecessary, an association may be asked to allow its membership records to beinspected.APPENDIX EDraft Statement of Revised policy. I have now carefully reviewed the basis on which recognition by the PostOffice should be given to new staff associations.2. My predecessor informed the Union of Post Office Workers inDecember 1946 that he saw no reason at that time for departing from the policyhitherto pursued of considering a request for recognition from an association ifit could show that it had in membership at least 40 per cent, of the organisedstaff of the grade or grades concerned. This statement seems to have been takenin certain quarters to mean that if an association could show a membership of40 per cent, of the organised staff of any particular grade or grades, it would automatically qualify for recognition in respect of that grade or grades. Thatis not the case, nor was it the intention of my predecessor when he made his statement conditional upon the prevailing circumstances on any given occasionbeing similar to those then obtaining.3. In its letter of 27th August, 1949, to the Engineering Officers (Tele-communications) Association, the Post Office stated that further examinationwould be made of their membership figures, for consideration of recognition, onthe assumption that&apos;&apos; in the meantime there is no change in regard to the principle on which the grade is used as a basis for considering claims by staff associationsto official recognition.&quot;       .4. I have carefully considered whether I should make any change in thebasis of recognition. It seems to me to be undeniable that there has been a changein the circumstances affecting recognition a possibility for which, as I have
explained, iriy^predecessors his statement of December i946.Jn ,yiew.iOf, the paramount, need in the present critical national situation toensure harmonious working relationships and measures of co-operation betweenthe Post Office and its staff as a whole, I have reached the conclusion that it isnecessary to restate the policy to be followed in dealing with requests for recognition of new associations in the Post Office.Questions of recognition are not, in my judgment, suitable for settlement by reference to any automatic formula. Each case must be considered individually and in any arrangements which may be made it will be a principal objective toensure that the interests of the Post Office staff are safeguarded. I propose,therefore, to restate my policy in general terms as follows.6. In deciding any particular case it is necessary to take account of such factors as the degree to which the new association is representative of the staffconcerned, how far the grade or grades, in respect of which recognition is claimedcan properly be regarded as a separate entity from the point of view of staff organisation and discussions, and generally the position pf the grade or grades in question in relation to other graces in the same organisation! It may also benecessary to take into account wider questions, such as the effect of a change inrepresentation on the general working relatibrisnips in the Post Office.7. I am considering the application for recognition by E.O. (T.) A. in thelight of the factors which I have now set out.APPENDIX FExtract from Estacode-Section N Relations with Staff(a) Staff Associations* *        ..     * * * *3. Recognised and Unrecognised Associations.-Aa. association Tmay,berecognised either by a department for departmental purposes or by the treasury for national purposes. In either case, the recognised association should have enough members in the grades or classes it claims to represent to enable it to enterinto binding agreements on their behalf. National recognition depends on the size of the association^ membership in the grades or classes concerned inthe Civil Service generally, and departmental recognition on the size of its member-ship in the grades or classes concerned within a department. TheTreasury has not defined with precision the percentages which establish a claim to national recognition or involve its withdrawal; but wherethere are conflicting claims steps are normally taken to ascertain fully paid-upmembership figures before recognition is granted or withdrawn, and, if necessary,an association may be asked to allow its membership records to be inspected.National and departmental recognition need;not, coincide, and there is noquestion of requiring Treasury approval for. the departmental recognition of an association. If an association other than the nationally-recognised association has a larger membership in a given grade in a particular department, it has the better claim so far as that grade in that department, is concerned. , But theNational Staff Side has pointed out that it,would be,embarrassing to: nationally-recognised associations if the, departmental application of a. national agreement were discussed only with a departmentally-recognised association which was in competition with the.association which was party to the agreement, and not withthe latter association. Accordingly it has been agreed that any department inwhich a question arises on the interpretation of a national agreement should ingeneral consult departmental representatives of the nationally-recognised associa-tion as well as any other association which is departmehtally recognised.Recognition gives an association, certain rights-the right to be brought into consultation by the employing authority on proposals affecting the category ofstaff which the recognition is granted; the right to be party to any formal agree-ments affecting their conditions of service; and the right to go to arbitration underthe terms of the Civil Service Arbitration Agreement. (See Arbitration N c 1.)It also involves the association in responsibilities to the extent to which, in theexercises of those rights, it makes itself a party to agreements and understandings
Departments have discretion to deal as thev think fit with correspondencefrom unrecognised associations, as they would with correspondence from any otherquarter. Letters from unrecognised associations on individual cases not involvingmatters of general principle can usually be dealt with, at their face value, butdepartments have discretion to do nothing beyond acknowledging them. Greatcaution should, however, be exercised in dealing with letters from unrecognisedassociations which involve matters of general principle. Departments should bear in mind that they and the recognised associations share the responsibility forthe terms of agreements that have been concluded through Whitley machinery orotherwise. Departments should be careful not to enter into arguments explana-tion or justification with an unrecognised association, especially where it is inobvious rivalry with a recognised one, on any matter which is the subject of anagreement or negotiations with a recognised association or Staff Side, since to do so would appear to give a standing to the unrecognised body, to which, on that particular matter, it had no claim. Above all, departments should refrain frominvoking as an answer to complaints by unrecognised associations the existenceof an agreement with a recognised association or Staff Side, and implying thatthat association or Staff Side is responsible for any defects in the agreement; anagreement is the equal responsibility of both parties to it.* * * * * *
