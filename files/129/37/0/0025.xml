The number in the Forces and on release leave declined over the eleven months by 71,000 and the number of registered unemployed by 43,000.The total in civil employment increased by 157,000 and the total in manufacturing,industries by 109,000. The textile industries gained 27,000 and the clothingindustries 38,000; but there was a. fall of 18,000 in the metals and engineering industries. Both agriculture and coalmining had fewer workers than in September1948.Change in Total Man-Power between September 1948 and August 1949	September	August	Change	1948	1949	Basic industries-	Thousands	Thousands	ThousandsTotal   ...............	4,267	4,262	-   5Agriculture...............	1,240	1,234	-   6Coal-mining...............	787	779	-   8Gas, water and electricity........	299	311	+   12Transport and communication     ......	1,818	1,815	-   3Manufacturing industries 			Total..................	8,173	8,282	+ 109Textiles         ......      ...      ...     -----	961	988	-f- 27Clothing...............	709	747	+ 38Metals, engineering, &amp;c.    .........	3,912	3,894	- 18Building and contracting...      ...      ...      ...	1,509	1,490	- 19Distributive trades.........      ...      ...	2,720	2,789	-f- 69Professional, financial and miscellaneous services	3,920	3,924	*   public administration     ...      ...      ...	1,466	1,465	-   1Total in civil employment       ...      ...      ...	22,055	22,212	. +157Registered unemployed (end of month estimate)	308	265	- 4337734			.B
2. The number of persons registered as unemployed in Great Britain fellfrom 376,000 at 10th January, 1949, to 243,000 on 11th July. There was a riseto 268,000 at 12th September due partly to the number of children who had leftschool in the summer and were still seeking employment. The number of males(inducting casuals) who had been wholly unemployed for more than eight weeksfell further to 90,100 at 12th September, -and the number of females who had beenout of work for the same period to 16,700. The count of persons registered asunemployed on 10th October gave a provisional figure of 300,000 a rise of 32,000on the figure for September.II. Production3. The index of total industrial production (1946=100) for July and august, taken together, declined seasonally to 118, but this was still 7 pointshigher than the average for July and August of last year. This rate of improve-ment over last year has been steadily maintained since February, and there is so far no suggestion of any falling-off in the rising trend of production.4. Building work has been maintained at a higher level this summer althoughthe labour force was slightly lower than in the summer of 1948. The index for building and contracting rose to 131 in each of the three months May, June and july compared with an average of 124 in the same three months of 1948.Interim Index of Industrial Production(Average 1946 ^ 100)All industries Manufacturing industries&apos; Points Points1947-48 1948-49 increase 1947-48 1948-49 increase3rd Quarter     ...... 109 115 6 110 118 8October and November 121 127 6 122 129 7December and January... 117 123 7 117 125 8February......... 123 131 7 124 133 9March and April        ... 121 128 7 123 131 8May and June   ...... 120 132 12 123 136 13July and August        ... ill 118 7 113 121 8Coal5. The seasonal rise in coal production, which usually takes place after the august holidays, has now begun and the output of deep-mined coal rose to4-16 million tons in each of the last two weeks of October. The weekly rate of output in September was 3-2 per cent, greater than in September 1948. total production of deep-mined coal in the 43 weeks ended 22nd October was 2 - 6 percent, above output in the corresponding period of 1948 but 1-1 per cent, belowthe target for the period. To achieve the target of 204 million tons for 1949;output during the remaining 9 weeks of this year would have to increase to ahaverage of 4-26 million tons a week or 8-5 per cent, more than the rate of output in the last 9 weeks of 1948.Output of Deep-mined Coal(Weekly averages)	1947-48	1948^9	Change	Thousand	Thousand	Per	tons	tons	cent.November.......	4,000	4,094	-1-2-4December and January	3,769	3,864	-1-2-5February ...	3,915	4,092	+4-SMarch and April	3,775	3,927	+40May and June	3,810	3,877	+1-8July and August	3,299	3,366	+2-0September        ......	3,842	3,966	-1-3-2October ...	4,002	4,116	. -(-2-86. The number of workers on the colliery books has fallen sharply from727,000 in March to 709,500 in the third week in October. This has been due to areduction in the number of trainees entering the industry, a fall in the inflowfrom other industries and the maintenance at a high level of the outflow of workers from mining to other industries. The number of face workers on the colliery1books has also been falling and in the third week of October was below the level inOctober 1948.
7. Absence from work rose to 13-66 per cent, in August, but declined to12-37 per cent, in the first three weeks of October, compared with 12-10 per cent,in October 1948. The total number of shifts worked has been lower than last yearand the increase in rate of production has been due to the higher output permanshift. &apos;J \ &apos; -    &apos;    &apos;       -Iron and Steel &apos;, .r 8. &apos; The output of steel ingots and castings rose after the holidays to 306,000tons a week in September. Total production for the first nine months amountedto 11-59 million tons 4^ per cent, more than in the same period of last year.;9. Stocks of pig iron rose further to 737,000 tons at the end of Septemberfrom the low level of 434,000 tons in April and stocks of scrap -rose to 805.000 tons.Stocks of imported iron ore have been increasing rapidly and at the end of Sep-tember were 23 per cent, greater than at September 1948.&quot;Textiles . .   ^s^^/^ivoo/j,/  &apos;        u-   &apos; \ i y,&apos;111 10. Textile production in August was affected by the holidays. The outputof worsted yarn and of wool, cotton and rayon fabrics was again below the&quot;targets.&quot;11. The weight of cotton yarn spun recovered from a weekly average of17-95 million lb. in August to 20 - 3 million lb. in the first three weeks of October,but this still fell short of the target of 21-9 million lb. a week for the month.12. Output of rayon yarn and staple fibre in August amounted to 21-7 million lb.   This was 34 per cent, greater than in August 1948.Motor Vehicles13. Output of passenger cars attained a new record level of 8,722 a weekduring September. The number produced for the home market rose to 3,513,aweek and the number produced for the export market (5,209 a week) thoughgreater than in April, was less than in May and in March of this year.14. The value of exports of passenger cars to Canada rose steadily from 306,000 in January to  1,056,000 in July, but fell back to  652,000 in august and  630,000 in September. Exports to the United States have been below 100,000 a month since April.Exports of all Passenger Cars (including Chassis)(Monthly averages or calendar months)  thousand1948 1st Quarter ...       .......2nd Quarter ...3rd Quarter ...      ......4th Quarter. ...      ........1949 1st   Quarter      .........2nd Quarter      ...      ...      ...July        ...     ............August    ..............September...     ...........15. Production of commercial vehicles also reached a new record level of4,505 a week in September. Of these 2,213 were produced for export: this exceeds the previous record of 2,129 a week in March.Merchant Shipbuilding16. The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction, which reached a post-war peak of 2,073,000 tons in June 1948, declined to 1,874,000 tons in July1949, but rose to 1,950,000 tons in September. New vessels laid down have risen from an average of 83,000 tons a month in the first quarter of 1949 to an averageof 114,000 tons a month in each of the second and third quarters. New vesselslaid down against export orders have risen more sharply from an average of37734 b 2Total to all	To	to countries	United States	Canada4,575	286	525,582	360	2514,697	593	4335,233	634	4605,334	205	3825,677	78	6295,782	62	1,0564,145	. 44	6526,876	64	630

There was a marked increase in the number of new permanent houses(excluding aluminium houses) completed, from 14,324 in August to 16,792 inSeptember, but this was well below the figure of 19,157 for September 1948.19. The number of new contracts placed during September fell to 15,870,the smallest monthly figure since April. The number of houses under constructionrose slightly to 198,206 at the end of September, compared with 197,931 at the endof September 1948.IY. External Trade20. The value of United Kingdom exports rose in September to  142-million compared with  137 -1 million in August and  141 - 7 million in July. Thevolume of exports is provisionally estimated at 144 per cent, of the 1938 averagecompared with 138 per cent, in August, 143 per cent, in July and an average of156 per cent, in the first quarter of the year. The value of textiles exported fellin September to  27-6 million the lowest monthly figure since June 1948.21. Owing to the interval between the time when shipments are made anddeclarations received, the September figures of exports do not reflect any effectof the changes in the exchange rates.22. Exports to the United States rose from  3 - 3 million in August to  4 -1 million in September. The monthly average of  3-7 million, in the third quarter-showed a slight improvement on the second quarter, but was still well below theaverage of  5 - 3 million in the first quarter of the year. Exports to Canada were maintained at an average of  6-6 million a month during the first half of thisyear but declined in August to  5-7 million and in September to  5-3 million.United Kingdom Exports to the Western Hemisphere(Monthly averages)	Total to Western Hemisphere o	To United States	To Canada	Per cent, of total United Kingdom exports						To Western Hemisphere o	To United States	To Canada		  million				1938    ......	6-9	1-7	20	17-7	4-4	5-01947    ...	14-9	4-0	3-7	15-7	4-2	3-91948 1st  Quarter	20-5	5-8	51	17-4	4-9	4-4- 2nd Quarter	20-3	5-1	5-8	15-6	3-9	4-53rd Quarter	21-8	5-7	6-2	16-1	4-2	4-64th Quarter	25-5	5-6	6-9	17-6	3-9	4-71949 1st  Quarter	24-6	5-3	6-6	16-0	3-4	4-32nd Quarter	18-9	3-3	6-6	13-1	2-3	4-6July      ...     ...	20-6	3-8	6-7	14-5	2-7	4-7August   ...	22-8	&apos;3-3	5-7	16-6	2-4	4-2September	20-5	4-1	5-3	14-5	2-9	3-8 ,(x) Including Japan and Philippines, but excluding: Sterling Area countries.

Since devaluation there has been a considerable inflow of dollar funds.Part of this has been for purchases of sterling which is accumulating on UnitedStates and other American accounts. Part has, no doubt, been used for settlementof debts previously incurred. So far there has been little recovery in dollarreceipts by sterling area countries, but these are usually low at this time of theyear. . - - .&apos;25. The changes in United Kingdom gold and dollar holdings are shown inthe table below.

The final figures of the United Kingdom general balance of payments for the first half of 1949 were only slightly different from those forecast in theEconomic Survey for 1949. The total deficit was  10 million and imports and exports were almost exactly as forecast. Between the first and second quarters of the year the balance of payments was becoming more unfavourable.   Imports
continued to be high, but exports fell from the rate they achieved in the early months of 1949, largely as a result of South Africah and Indian restrictions on imports. The immediate effect of devaluation will almost certainly be to makethe balance of payments still more unfavourable since &quot;import costs in sterlingincrease immediately, while any increases in the volume and price of exports willbe more gradual.1948	1949	1948	1949	1948	1949	1948	194995	94	96	93	95	90	92	15996	110	93	116	96	101	127	17497	109	94	113	96	101	133	17297	108(0	98	1140	93	1000	145	170027. The whole of the South African gold loan has now been.repaid in sterling. .  &apos;&quot; - ;YL-Stocks28. There has been a marked increase in the level of stocks during the last six months. The index of the volume of stocks of food and animal feeding-stuffs,raw materials and petroleum products (December 1947 ^ 100) increased from94 in March to 110 in August, when it was 14 points above the level in August 1948.Some reduction is expected during the next few months, but the index in Decemberis forecast to be 11 points greater than in December 1948.Index of Volume of Stocks in the United Kingdom(December 1947 ^ 100)Food and animal Raw PetroleumTotal feeding stuffs materials products194March ...August ...SeptemberDecember0 Forecast.*  i VII.-prices import and Export Prices29. The index of export prices (1947^ 100) fell back by one point inSeptember to 113, while the index of import prices fell one point to 111. Althoughthe index of export prices has been almost unchanged at 113 during 1949, pricesof imports have been falling and the index in September was seven points belowthe peak achieved in the early months of the year. The effect of devaluation onthis trend may not be seen for several months.Retail Prices30. The interim index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) rose from 111 inAugust to 112 in September, the rise being chiefly due to a seasonal movement inthe prices of certain vegetables. This is the first movement in the index since may, when the changes in the food subsidies added two points to the index.The chief rises so far this year have been in the food group, which has risen9 points from 108 to 117. The index of clothing prices, which had risen 16 percent, between June 1947 and January 1949. rose only slightly to 119 in September.All other items remained practically unchanged.Wholesale Prices31. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices (1938=100), whichhas been tending to fall since June, rose between one and two points in September,largely owing to the effect of the alteration in the exchange rate on the monthly average prices of non-ferrous metals, raw cotton and imported wheat and flour.The index for food and tobacco alone fell two points, the higher prices for imported wheat and flour being offset by lower prices for certain fruit and vegetables. Industrial materials and manufactures rose three points, largely owing to the rise in basic materials.32. . As the prices used in compiling the index are average prices for themonth, the full impact of changes in the exchange rates is not reflected in the september figures.
Prices in the United States ., -33. Moody&apos;s index1 of staple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 ^ 100)fell from 390 at the beginning of 1949 to about 340 in June, and has fluctuatedaround the June level in subsequent months.34. The United States (Bureau of Labour) index of wholesale prices(1938 = 100) rose one point in September to 195, which is 20 points below the peakreached in August 1948. On the whole, the index has shown a fairly steadydecline over the last twelve months, while the index of wholesale prices of farm products has shown an even more rapid decline. ,-        YIIL^Wage Rates35. The Ministry of Labour index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)remained unchanged in September at 109.36. Increases in wage rates which became effective in September addedapproximately  44,000 to the weekly wage bill of about 230,000 workers. Theprincipal increases were in milk distribution in England and Wales, sugarconfectionery and food preserving, and in the road haulage industry.37. In recent months wage increases have been relatively small. So far thisyear the greatest addition to the national wage hill has been that obtained by agricultural workers,, whose minimum rates were increased between March andMay by 4s. a week for men and 3s. a week for women in Great Britain, and by4.s. a week for adults in Northern Ireland. The increases in agricultural wages were accompanied by a reduction in the normal working hours to which theminimum rates apply.38. The next largest addition to the national wage bill was gained bytextile workers, over half a million of whom have had increases in their wage ratesaveraging about 5s. a week per worker.39. The National union of Railwaymen and the National Union of Mine-workers are both claiming increases in wages for their lowest-paid workers. the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions recently presented to theemployers proposals for a new wages structure involving increases of 4s. a week to unskilled and 13s. to skilled workers. Since then the Confederation haspresented a claim for an all-round flat increase of  1 per week to be met out of profits.IX.-European Recovery programme the Appropriation Act for the European Recovery Programme (April 1949-June1950)40. Although the legislation authorising the continuance of the economic co-operation Administration was passed by Congress in May (as reported in cp. (49) 121), actual funds were not voted until September. (In the interimE.C.A.&apos;s operations were financed by a temporary loan from the ReconstructionFinance Corporation and by other expedients).41. The amounts finally voted were $3,778 million for the financial yearJuly 1949-June 1950 including an amount not exceeding $150 million in the formof loans, and in addition $1,074 million for the final quarter of the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1949.42. $3,778 million is 10 per cent, less than the amount asked for by theAdministration (which itself had been reduced below the original estimate to take account of the drop in some United States prices). As against this reduction,however, it should be noted that, of the many severe restrictions on the use of the funds which were proposed in the course oi the Congressional debate, very fewwere incorporated in the legislation.Division of Aid 1949-5043. The 1949-50 Division of Aid operation in O.E.E.C. proved extremelydifficult.   In the Council of the Organisation many delegates, including the
United Kingdom representative, expressed dissatisfaction with the recommenda-tions of the Working Party set up to screen the programmes submitted by the participating countries. It was therefore agreed that the whole problem shouldbe reconsidered by the Chairman at the official level (Baron Snoy of Belgium) andthe Secretary-General (M. Marjolin of France). Baron Snoy and M. Marjolinassumed that $3,776 million would be available for division between the partici-pants for 1949-50 and prepared a revised allocation of which the United kingdom share was $962 million. The Snoy-Marjolin allocation was accepted by all the delegates to the O.E.E.C. Council.44. The final E.R.P. appropriation for 1949-50 was as stated above $3,778 million. After taking into account E.C.A. administrative expenses and acarry over from the April-June appropriation, the amount available for division between the participants became $3,776 million, the figure assumed by Baron Shoyand M. Marjolin. E.C.A. are, however, insisting that $150 million of this shallbe set aside to form a pool to finance Colonial development and to assist the liberali-sation of European trade. E.C.A. propose that this sum be deducted from the allocations recommended by the O.E.E.C. Council on a, pro rota basis; this wouldhave the effect of reducing the United Kingdom share of Aid for 1949-50 to$920 million.Allotments45. The United Kingdom received allotments totalling $1,619-7 million for the fifteen months&apos; period from April 1948 (the beginning of E.R.P.) to June1949. Against the United Kingdom&apos;s share of Aid for the year July 1949-June 1950 (i.e., an estimated $920 million -see &quot;Division of Aid &quot; above) twoallotments have so far been made, the first of $292-2 million and the second of$351 million (total $643-2 million). -Intra-European Payments Scheme46.   The new Payments Agreement (for 1949-50) was signed on 7th Septem-ber.    It is based on the compromise proposals agreed between Ministers in&quot;July, i.e.: (1) Drawing rights will not be convertible into dollars this year.(2) The Belgian surplus with the O.E.E.C. countries was assessed at. $400million.(3) The latter would be covered by :-Million dollars(a) An E.C.A. unconditional grant of.........      200(&amp;) Drawing rights granted by Belgium  to other.E.E.C. countries against the receipts of con-ditional E.C.A. dollars   ...      ...      ...      ...      112;5(c) Credits granted by Belgium to O.E.E.C. countries on the same terms regarding interest, &amp;c,as E.C.A. loans    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       87-5(4) Only 25 per cent, of the drawing rights granted by one O.E.E.C. countryto another (and consequently only 25 per cent, of conditional aiddollars) will be transferable.. (5) The amount of drawing rights which may be transferred to Belgium maynot exceed $40 million.  .-47. The drawing rights granted by the United Kingdom, of which 25 percent, are transferable, are as follows : Million dollarsAustria ... ...      ... ... .... ... 20France .......... ... ... ... 108Greece ... ...      ... ... ... ... 27Turkey ... ...      ... ... ... ... .    1648. The United Kingdom receives drawing rights on Belgium to the extentof $102 million, of which $28 million are in the form of loans.49. The new agreement contained a provision allowing for a review of its operation after three months.   The possibility of effecting a major change, in the
37734clight of the readjustment of exchange rates and of proposals for a radical altera-tion in the Organisation&apos;! methods of programming, is how under discussion withE.C.A. and O.E.E.C. . - - t    v -        ;\-   1 &apos;Ministerial-Meetings in Parisy2&amp;th October to 2nd November50.. Important meetings-between Ministers of the O.E.E.C. countries andthe Economic Co-operation Administrator (Mr. Hoffman) took place in Parisbeginning 28th October. One of the major results of these meetings was a decisionto, undertake a radical simplification of the programming Work of the Organisa-tidh, which, up to the present time, has imposed so heavy a burden of work on it that it has never been really free to consider its wider and more fundamentalproblems. United Kingdom proposals for the liberalisation of trade were accepted and, as an immediate step, participating Governments agreed to adopt the objec-tive of removing quantitative restrictions before 15th December, 1949, on at least50 per cent, of their total imports on private account from the other participants.-
