(49) 23324th November, 1949CABINETCOMMUNISTS AND FASCISTS : SECRET GOVERNMENT CONTRACTSMemorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Labourand National service on 19th May (CM. (49) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet invited theMinister of Labour to obtain the views of the National Joint Advisory Councilon the arrangements proposed in CP. (49) 107 for excluding untrustworthypersons from participation in secret Government work undertaken by contractors.2. These proposals were duly put to the National Joint Advisory Council at its meeting on 27th July. Some reservations were then expressed as to theirdesirability, and both sides asked for further time to consider their implications.On 26th October the Council again considered the proposed arrangements. Itwas clear that there was considerable opposition to them from both the TradeInion and the Employers&apos; side. While there was no disagreement with the proposition that the security of the State must be paramount, it was thought thatthe proposed policy announcement would cause controversy out of all proportion to the issues involved and that the appeal procedure proposed would cut across the established conciliation machinery in industry. It was pointed out that only avery limited number of cases were likely to arise and that these, in the view ofthe Council, could easily be dealt with as at present on an ad hoc basis between theGovernment Departments concerned (of which there are only two) and the con-tractor. The unanimous advice of the Council was that the problem shouldcontinue to be dealt with&apos;by administrative action between the GovernmentDepartment and the contractor concerned, that the proposed arrangements shouldnot be put into effect and that no public statement should be made.3. We have reconsidered this matter in the light of the consideration givento it by the Council, and, while we do not dissent from their general conclusions,we feel that their recommendations call for some comment. While it is true thatthe number of untrustworthy persons whom the Admiralty and the Ministry ofSupply will wish to remove from access to secret work in the hands of contractorsis comparatively small, these cases will not be confined to persons employed asunskilled or even as skilled workmen whose dismissal or transfer would be unlikely to have such serious consequences to the individual. On the contrary, the type of person whose removal is most urgently required in the interests of national securityis the scientist or professional man who, in the course of his duties, is likely tosecure details not only of a limited, part but often of the whole of a secret process.The transfer to non-secret work or where this is impracticable the discharge ofsuch persons cannot be attributed to the normal custom of the trade and, especially as discharge may mean not only the loss of the existing job but difficulty in finding a new one, it will be most unlikely that we shall avoid public comment andfjnestions to Ministers in a number of these cases.37924
4. We feel, therefore, bound to warn our colleagues that sooner or later a minister will be asked whether he has requested or in any way been associatedwith the removal of one of these persons from his employment. The answer tosuch a question can only be that the Minister has requested the firm, in accordancewith the terms of the contract, to remove the man from secret work. The minister will also have to be prepared to deal with two further points : (a) On what grounds this action was taken.(b) What safeguards have been provided to prevent a miscarriage of justice?5. The grounds for the Ministers action can only be those described in cp. (49) 107, i.e., the need for safeguarding vital defence secrets. In other words,as soon as a cas&apos;e like this becomes a live issue, we cannot, whatever the advice ofthe Council, avoid a policy statement.6. In regard to safeguards the advice of the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil eases the Governments position. It is now clear not only that therewould be the most strenuous objection on the part of Trades Unions as well as of employers to the creation of any special appeal tribunal, but also that theUnions would be content with their normal right to make representations insuch cases. If, therefore, the question of safeguards is raised the Minister can say that this whole problem has been discussed with the Council, who have advised that the appropriate machinery for any employee who considers that he has beenunfairly treated would be for him to make representations through his Unionunder the normal custom of his employment.7. It is fair to point out that such representations by a Union will not,as in the case of a civil servant, lead to any investigation into the justification for the conclusion that the man is a Communist or Fascist, &amp;c. The Union&apos;shelp in safeguarding the man&apos;s interest is to ensure that the employees action is inevitable under his contract and not simply due to prejudice. The Minister ofLabour is, however, satisfied that the Trade Unions accept the position that an employer is bound by the terms of his contract to remove a man from secret workif so requested by the Government Department concerned.8.   We recommend therefore (a) that, in view of the advice given by the National Joint Advisory Council,there should be no immediate statement of policy on the governments intentions in regard to the exclusion of untrustworthy persons from participation in secret Government work undertaken by contractors,and that the idea of a special appeal tribunal should be abandoned;(b) that, where the responsible Minister is satisfied that the removal of anuntrustworthy individual is essential, such removal should take placeby administrative action, the Minister requesting the firm, under theterms of their contract, to remove the man from secret work;(c) that, if and when the question is raised whether a Minister has been associated with the removal of an individual employee, the answer should be on the lines suggested in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.A. V. A.G. A. I.24*a November, 1949.
