(49) 237ifiTH NOVEMBER,  1949COPY NO. 11CABINETGERMANY:  MEETING OF UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES AND FRENCH foreign ministers,  9TH AND 1QTH NOVEMBER,  1949Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe establishment of tho High Commission and of the.German Federal Government at Bonn in September marked the endof a stage in our policy towards Germany.     The progress made during that stage was founded on a whole complex of agreementsnegotiated between the United States Government, the FrenchGovernment and ourselves in June, 1948, and April, 1949.These agreements covered such matters as the occupation statute and the German Basic Law, the establishment of theInternational Authority for the Ruhr and the Military SecurityBoard, reparations and prohibited industries.2. With the establishment of the High Commission andthe German Federal Government a number of new problems inGermany began toSome of these, particularly those relating to the dismantling programme, called for urgent con-sideration by the three Western Occupying Powers.I there-fore decided to invite M.  So human and Mr. Acheson to take theopportunity afforded by the meetings in Paris during the first week in November of the Committee of Ministers of the Councilof Europe and the Consultative Council of the Brussels treaty powers to have a discussion with me on the situation in germany with a view to reaching agreement on our policy and programme for the next stage and on the steps to be taken to bring theGerman people and the German Federal Government by progressivestages into close association with the West,      I felt that theneed to hold such a meeting at a very early date was madestronger by the reports received from the British Zone ofGermany which showed that the dismantling programme, particu-larly in respect of certain of the longer-term plants, was meeting with increasingly serious opposition both from Germanofficials and the German people.     Although the dismantlingpolicy had been agreed between the United States Government,the French Government and ourselves, by far the greatest burdenfell upon the British Zone.3. Mr. Acheson and M.  Schuman at once accepted my proposal to hold a meeting, and this took place in Paris on 9th and 10th November.      The agenda was as follows:I.      Programme for Germany until time comes for theOccupation Statute to be reviewed.II.      Association with the Western world.(a) Conditions under which Germany could participate in the Council of Europe - including the questionof the participation of the Saar.(b) Germany&apos;s participation in other international agencies and organisations,,  including technicalo r gan i s a t i on s.

n ti ri00 IIII.      Security.(a) Dismantling:    Consideration of the proposalsof the Federal Chancellor.(b) Germany&apos;s accession to the International RuhrAuthority.(c) Germany&apos;s acceptance of the Military SecurityBoard.(d) Decartelisation.IV.      Internal German Problems.(a) Operation of the Occupation Statute.(b) Germany&apos;s representation abroad.(c) Termination of state of war with Germany.(d) Attitude to the so-called German democratic republic.h. In spite of certain difficulties, to which I willrefer later, my discussions with M.  Schuman and Mr. Achesonwere very frank and friendly and I v/as very pleased to seehbwmuch of the ground which we covered was common to us all.In particular, we all recognised the need for a new programme to carry us forward until the time comes at the end of next&apos;year for the Occupation Statute to be reviewed, and.it wasalso recognised that we ought all to be ready to make some concessions for the sake of reaching agreement on our jointpolicy.5. The actual decisions which resulted from our talkswere embodied in a Directive to the three High Commissioners,which is annexed.      This Directive is to be used by the high commission as a general guide for the development of allied policy in Germany, aiming eventually at the creation of a more normal situation in Germany and the establishment of more normalrelations between Germany and other countries, subject always to the necessary measures for security.      The Directive is alsoto be used by the High Commission as a basis for negotiation with the German Federal Chancellor with a view to establishingagreement with the Federal Government on the programme which isto be followed.      I do not think it necessary to draw mycolleagues&apos; attention to the details of the Directive, apartfrom certain points mentioned below,6. By far the most important and difficult part of our discussions in Paris was connected with Section III of the directive, which deals with the question of reparations and security,  including the dismantling problem.      This part of the directive raised great problems for M.  Schuman and the FrenchGovernment, since any arrangement which would result in a high level of steel-producing capacity being left in Germany islikely to arouse much opposition in the French Chamber and among the French people.      Moreover any modification of theexisting reparations programme involving a departure from theagreements which had been reached earlier in the year in washington might be expected to cause difficulties with theGovernments represented on the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency.On the other hand the very serious difficulties which we hadbeen encountering in the British Zone in the work of demolition,and the strong probability that the programme v/as likely tobreak down.of its own accord for lack of German labour to carry

it through in its entirety, made it imperative that fresharrangements should he agreed between the three WesternOccupying Powers and embodied in a general settlement withthe Federal German Government.7. After a long discussion it was agreed that,provided the German Government gave the necessary assuranceson security and evidence of their good intentions by agreeing to join the International Ruhr Authority, and declared their intention of co-operating closely with the Military SecurityBoard, the High Commissioners should have authority to remove from the list of plants at present scheduled to be dismantledthe following:(i)   The synthetic oil plants.(ii)    The synthetic rubber plants, less certain speciellaboratory equipment.(iii)    All plants in Berlin at present scheduled to bedismantled.(iv)   The following steel plants:August Thyssen, HambornHuttenwerke Siegerland, CharlottenhutteRuhrstahl, HattingenBochumer Verein, Gusstahlwerke, BochumAugust Thyssen Hutte, Hiederreinische HutteKlockner Werke, DusseldorfDeutsche Edelstahlwerke, Krefeld8. This list includes all the major steel plants except  !the Herman Goering works at Salzgitter and Krupps, Sssen.Although both Mr. Acheson and I would have been agreeable tothe inclusion of the plant at Salzgitter among those in respectof which the High Commissioners have authority to cease dis-mantling, M.  Schuman said that his apolitical life, which was already in danger, would be lost if dismantling ceased at thisplant.      In view of the great efforts which M.&quot;Schuman and theFrench Government had made to meet us on this dismantlingproblem and of the overriding importance of not prejudicingM.  Schuman&apos;s position, Mr. Acheson and I agreed not to press the matter further.      It must also be remembered that this plant was built during the war and operated by forced labour, someof it from France.9. M.  Schuman also put forward, certain other conditions,the most important of which were:-(a) That in order to ensure that the retained list of plants should not cause Gorman steel production to exceed the agreed ceiling (i.e.  11.1 million tons per annum in the three western Zones) these plants should be placed under a specialcontrol and a special Statute;    and(b) That the German Government should be required to compensate the Governments represented on the Inter-AlliedReparations Agency for the loss of reparations by the supplyof plant of an equivalent value.10. On (a), the practical objections were pointed out andit was made clear that there would be very little chance ofsuch a system being able to work in practice.      M.  Schumaneventually agreed to accept a formula which laid down that theHigh Commissioners would automatically put these seven retainedplants out of production if German total steel productionexceeded the existing ceiling of 1.1.1 million tons per annum.-7-a-

11. As to (b), both Mr. ^cheson and I took strongexception to the proposal for payment of compensation to theGovernments represented on the Inter-Allied ReparationsAgency.     We pointed out that the value of the synthetic oil plants and the remainder of the steel plants would run. intomany millions of pounds, that the only way that Germany couldpay the compensation suggested would be by deliveries from current production and that in fact the United States and our-selves would have to find the foreign exchange to do it.     were fused to agree to such a solution, and eventually M. Schumanwithdrew his condition,12c The Americans also raised during our discussions the restrictions which should be imposed upon German shipping.At that time virtual agreement had been reached at theofficial level on the nature of all restrictions with theexception of the speed of exceptional ships, the definition of tonnage, and one or two minor technical matters.      Withregard to speed we and the French wished to restrict the trialspeed of exceptional ships to 16 knots as being in our viewadequate to maintain a sustained sea speed of about 15 knots;the Americans believed 16-g- knots to be necessary for thispurpose and thought that agreement on this figure might be of value in the negotiations with the Federal Chancellor.      Aspart of a satisfactory settlement of the questions under dis-cussion in Paris I thought it wise to recommend to mycolleagues the acceptance of 1.6-g- knots;    in the light of thisagreement a solution of the question of tonnage satisfactory to ourselves has since been reached.13* I feel confident that if the decisions which were reached in Paris can be translated into an agreement with theGerman Federal Government and put into practice as a programmeagreed both by the three Western Occupying Pov/ers and thatGovernment, we ought to make steady progress in Germany duringthe next stage.      Although the Germans may try to obtain further concessions from the High Commission in the course ofthe negotiations I consider that the High Commissioners have got sufficient authority now on all major questions to enablethem to arrive at a satisfactory settlement, provided that they all three stand firm on the essential points and do not giveDr. Adenauer any encouragement to think that he may obtainmore by playing one Allied Government off against another.The first meeting on 15th November between the High Commissionand Dr. Adenauer seems to have been successful and I hope verymuch that the discussions themselves will not be protracted,since I feel sure that the sooner an agreement is reached the better it will be for all concerned and the sooner our present difficulties in the British Zone will disappear.      Our aim should be to use the time between now and the moment when theOccupation Statute is due for review to prepare the ground, forthe further evolution of our policy in Germany, which aims atbinding the German Government and the German people more closelytc the Western world and at the same time making adequate pro-vision for security.E. B.reign Office, S. W. 1.16TH NOVEMBER,  1949.

ANNEXDIRECTIVE TO THE HIGH COMMISSIONERSGENERAL LINES OF POLICY TOWARDS GERMANY(l)     This Directive is intended, to establish a programme for the development of Allied policy in Germany whichaims eventually at creating a more normal situation inGermany and at the establishment of more normalrelations between Germany and other countries subjectto those measures only which are necessary for security,including the retention of supreme authority,(2) . The Occupation Statute will remain in force untilrevieweda(3)     Meanwhile the ground for a smooth evolution shouldbe prepared by a programme for 1950 which will includemeasures outlined in the following paragraphs.ASSOCIATION OP GERMANY WITH THE WESTERN WORLD(a)     Council of europe the admission of Germany to the Council ofEurope is an associate member has alreadyobtained support in principle in the Committeeof Ministers,     It has been approved by thoStanding Committee of the Assembly and also by. - the three Ministers at this meeting.     Finaldecision on the point is expected at the next meeting of the Committee of Ministers,      It ishoped that before then the Governments may heable to advise the High Commissioners that theycan.inform the Federal Chancellor that a request for admission as an associate- member couldopportunely /

opportunely be made, together with the necessarydeclaration accepting the basic principles ofthe Statute   of the Council of Europe,(b)    International 0rganisations.The Ministers gave approval in principle tothe Report of a Working Party set up in washington to examine the question of German participation in certain international bodies.     The high commissioners will take this Report as a guide andwill, in conjunction with the German FederalSovfiPnmant^ examine ^ach. proposal for theparti*^il)atioja at Germany in. an irvfcewAtiaxialbody on its merits.    In addition to the bodieslisted in the Working Party&apos;s Report,, ministers decided that consideration should be given tothe admission of Germany to the Central RhineCommission on the basis of the JJiannhoimConvention of 1868.

III.   1.     The High Commissioners are authorised to reply tothe letter received from Dr. Adenauer by infoiming him that they are prepared to discuss the problem raised inhis letter-with a view to seeking a solution which willprovide a final settlement of the dismantling problem,and at the same time will satisfy the Allied requirementsregarding security.2.     As a first step in the discussions with the federal chancellor, the High Commissioners should tell Dr.Adenauer that in order to afford the necessary assurance of security and evidence of good intentions the GermanGovernment should agree to join the International RuhrAuthority and declare its intention of co-operatingclosely with the Military Security Board.3.     The High Commissioners   should draw the   attention ofthe Chancellor to the importance from the point of viewof security which their Governments attach to thedecartelisation of German industry, and should seek enassurance from him that the Federal Government will-operate in the execution of measures designed to thinend, particularly Military Government Law 75*k.0     As part of a general settlement .the High Cammioolonerswill, at their discretion, take up with the federal chancellor any other points which they consider can usefully be included in this -settlement.     They should at the same time emphasise that their Governments intend to observe continually the methodical development offtheir programme in Germany as set out in their directive;the present settlement is intended to promote thismethodical development and not   as an indication that the pace of development might be accelerated by the presentation of fresh requests.

5.     Provided that the High Commissioners obtain asatisfactory response from the Federal Chancellor onthe matters mentioned in paragraphs 2-4- above, they areauthorized to reach a settlement of the dismantlingissue within the limit of the conditions set out below:(a) They will not make any concessions regardingCategory I war plants or the demilitarizationmeasures which are not part of the reparationsprogramme.(b) To the extent necessary to obtain a final and satisfactory settlement, they may agree to:(i) the removal from the reparations list ofthe synthetic oil plants;(ii) the removal from the reparations list of .the synthetic rubber plants, less certain special laboratory equipment;Hote*   The synthetic&apos; plants referred to in (i) and(ii) above must be so controlled that they do not produceony prohibited products or exceed the limitations, ifany, placed upon the production of any other products.(iii) the limitation of dismantling of the I.Or.Farben plant at Ludwigshaven to thatportion which has already been dismantledto an extent of 40%;(iv) the cessation of all dismantling in Berlin(v) the cessation of dismantling at thefollowing steel plants;August Thyssen, HambornHuttenwerke/

Huttenwerke Siegerland, Charlottenhutte

Ruhrstahl, Hattingen

Bochumer Verein, Gusstahlwerke, Bechum

August Thyssen Hutte, Niederreinische Hutte

Klockner Werke, Dusseldorf

Deutsche Edelstahlwerke, Krefeld.

except that electric furnaces should be destroyed or dismantled save in those cases where the High Commissioners determine that without such electric furnaces the plant cannot reasonably function.

6. The High Commissioners should emphasize to the Federal Chancellor that the established reparations programme, save in so far as it may be modified in accordance with paragraph 5 above, will be carried out. The programme of reparations in the steel processing industry will not be affected by modification now made in the steel producing industry.

7. With reference to paragraph 6 above, the High Commissioners should seek an assurance from the Federal Chancellor that the Federal Government will use its influence and authority to ensure that the execution of the remaining dismantling programme is not obstructed.

8. The High Commissioners will make it clear to the Federal Chancellor that the prohibitions and limitations on production contained in the Washington Agreement on Prohibited and Limited Industries are to remain in force. The Federal Chancellor in his letter has proposed the establishment of a committee to study the question of steel production and requirements. The High Commissioners will inform him that their Governments do not consider that such a committee could do useful work at this time.

9. In enforcement of paragraph 8 above, air re-equipment or modification which increases the capacity of steel producing plants will continue to require license from the Military Security /Board



card and such licences will not be given., save in exceptionalircumstances, while the capacity of the industry remains higherhan that necessary to   produce the annual permitted amount,he High Commissioners should point this out to the Fedenalhsncellor in order that he may understand that the re-equipmentf steel plants which have been wholly or partially dismantiedr destroyed will not be permitted.    The High Commissioners willake any other action which they may deem necessary to ensurehat this principle is observed.0.   The High Commission shall be given a special responsi-ility with regard to the control of production and the allo-ation of the products of the seven steel plants to be taken offhe dismantling list, regaining full powers .in this respect; andpey will take immediate action at these plants if they findat the permitted level of steal production is being exceeded.c   All equipment which has been dismantled by the date which agreement is reached between the High Commissioners and[he Federal Chancellor will be made available to I.A.R.A, asparations.   The High Commissioners shall have discretion toke exceptions only in those cases where a very small amountequipment has already been dismantled and the retentionthis equipment will not materially affect the productionpacity of the plant in question.a   The High Commissioners should endeavour to reach a veryick settlement with the Federal Chancellor.    If their discus-ons with him should appear likely to become protracted, theSh Commissioners may at their discretion slow down, withouteJudice to recommencement at full speed, dismantling atrtain key plants from the list of those on which they areven liberty to negotiate in accordance with the above paragraphs

GSR&amp;AN INTERNAL&apos;PROBLEMS( a)   Germany1 c Representation, abroadThe High Commissioners should inform theFederal Chancellor that they are authorised topermit the gradual establishment by the federal german Republic of consular and commercialrepresentatives in those countries which are preparedto receive them.     They may also approve theauthorisation of a Bureau, probably forming part of theFederal Chancellor&apos;s Office, to control these officials and to co-ordinate instructions to German representativesattending international organisations and conferenisas^These measures do not affect the powers reserved tothe High Commission in the field of foreign affairs,J!b)     fformination of the state of wayThe Foreign Ministers decided that each Governmentconcoruod including the Benelux and commonwealth governments should examine tho prohlem and exchangeviews preparatory to an eventual meeting of a committedof jurists.     In the event that this question Is raisagby tho Federal Chancellor, the High Commissioners will inform him that the continuation of the state of warinvolves technical and.legal problems of a very complicated nature.     They may further advise him in strict confidence that the Ministers have decided tohave this question examined carefully by jurists;at the same time they should warn him that at thepresent time the legal difficulties appear to be considerable.(c)     Attitude to the so-called German democratic republic./The

The Foreign Ministers agreed that it was desirable that the Governments of the Western world should adopt a common attitude towards the so-called German Democratic Republic and should as far as possible avoid any action involving the express or implied recognition of that Republic as a do facto or do juro  government. They agreed that when the Permanent Commission in London of the Brussels Treaty Powers considers the problems arising from trade agreements between the Soviet Zone of Germany and other countries or other matters which might raise the question of such recognition, the United States Government should send a representative to the meetings. They also agreed that the United States Government and the Governments represented on the Permanent Commission should if necessary make representations to other interested Western European Governments. Finally the Foreign Ministers agreed that the High Commissioners should inform the Federal Government of the Ministers&apos; concern in regard to this problem and use their influence to ensure that the action of the Federal Government conformed.



THE SAAR&apos;It is indicated for the information ofthe High Commission that the Ministers recordedthat they could agree to the admission of the saar territory into the Council of Europe as anassociate member on the understanding that thedefinitive status of the Saar shall await thePeace Settlement.^
