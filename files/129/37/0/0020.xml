THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF His  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   &quot;November 1949SECRET Copy No,CP. (49) 2201st November, 1949.31CABINETSTABILISATION OF SALARIES AND WAGES IN THE national health service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofHealth .,-We have been considering the application to the National Health Service ofthe statements about the stabilisation of personal incomes which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer made in the House of Commons on 27th September. An extractfrom his speech is reproduced as. an Appendix to this memorandum. In advanceof any general statement by the Government on wages policy, the Minister ofHealth proposes that the Health Ministers should bring this extract to the special attention of the Whitley Councils for the Health Services (on the ManagementSide of which they are represented)^ and should impress on them that all dis-cussions about salaries and wages must be conducted in accordance with theprinciples it sets out. The Secretary of State for Scotland considers that this might be open to objection as bordering on interference with wage-negotiating&apos;.machinery, and that it would be no less effective if the Chancellors statement were introduced into the discussions on the Whitley Councils by the official members ofthe Management Sides in the usual way.2. Such action will, we hope, lead to claims which are pending being, ingeneral either deferred or rejected. With regard to the claims at present underconsideration, there will in some cases he special difficulties in applying the broadprinciple of income stabilisation to the particular case. We set out below the sort of cases that we have in mind and the lines that we should like to follow in dealing with them.3.   The difficult cases fall into six broad groups : (i) There are a number in which an agreement has already been reachedbut has not yet been published. An example is the basic nursing grades in tuberculosis and fever hospitals. Here new salaries have beenagreed as part of the general settlement covering the basic hospitalgrades (the other parts of which have already been published), but theyare not yet being paid. Our proposal would be to honour agreements of this sort and to proceed with publication.(ii) In at least one instance, an offer has been made by the Management Sidebut has not so far been accepted by the Staff Side. Here again our proposal would be not to withdraw an offer already made.(iii) In another case, an impossible anomaly would be created if the situation were left entirely as at present. This has arisen with nurses&apos; salariesbecause we have dealt with the-basic grades of hospital nurses but havenot touched the higher grades; In accordance with the Chancellor^statement it would not be our intention to carry upwards the amountof the revision which has been made at the bottom, but at the momenta Ward Sister who is promoted to certain higher posts (e.g., Depart-mental Sister) actually loses money, and such an anomaly clearly cannotbe allowed to. continue.37787
(iv) There is another group of cases where a breakdown in an importantservice may have to be faced unless some adjustments are made.  Forexample, the revision of the salaries of the lower nursing grades in, hospital has not yet reached the Nursing Assistant in mental hospitals,,1 .( though it has covered the student and trained nurses in both generaland mental hospitals. To stop short of the Nursing Assistant grademight have serious consequences in the mental hospitals. Similarly,the priority dental services for mothers and young children havealready suffered a set-back through the remuneration of public dental officers employed by local authorities falling out of line with that ofdentists in other branches of the National Health Service, and there might well be a more serious breakdown if nothing is done. difficulties are also being met in recruiting the very limited number of techniciansrequired for the hearing aid service, and an improvement in the presentwage is overdue. On this type of case, it would be our hope thatnecessary adjustments could be made.(v) A further group is provided by certain grades for whom no nationalscale is in existence. Scientists employed in hospitals (e.g., biochemistsand physicists) are an example. In cases where the negotiation ofnational scales would be a help towards economy in administration wewould like authority to proceed.(vi) A final group consists of claims where the Staff Side have strong argu-ments based on precedents which already exist both inside and outsidethe National Health Service, and which, if the claim is rejected, theycould use with great effect before an arbitration tribunal. An exampleis provided by the medical auxiliary grades. Certain minor conces-sions have already been granted to medical laboratory technicians,including the award of London weighting and the ironing out of differences between the scales applying in England and Wales, onthe one hand, and in Scotland on the other. Grades such as the physio-therapists will expect to receive similar concessions, and if they arerefused will have strong arguments to place before an arbitration tribunal.4. This last group raises the question of awards by arbitration tribunals.If we reject claims which can then be taken successfully to arbitration, our action may be nullified unless different standards are adopted at arbitration in future.This goes beyond the special problems arising in the National Health Service and could only be dealt with on a general basis, and we do not suggest that the health service should be made the subject of any special restriction in this respect.5. Details of the particular cases will be furnished if our colleagues so wish,but we thought that it might be enough to describe them in the broad groups into which they fall. We should be glad to have agreement to our proceeding on thelines proposed in (i)-(v) of paragraph 3 above, and guidance on the line we shouldtake on cases falling within (vi) of that paragraph.A. W.A. B.1st November, 1949.appendix extract from Speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in theHouse of Commons on 27th September, 1949*****,*But the present policy demands for its success a great measure of restraintif the,matter. of personal incomes. If it is not made to succeed, then-deflation willbe added to it and we shall have failed to avert mass unemployment and poverty.It is, therefore, of critical importance that nothing and I mean literally nothing should be done to increase personal incomes arising out of profits, wages orsalaries at least until we can see how far our policy has succeeded in bringingnearer a balance in our dollar-sterling trade.* * * &apos; * * ,*
The White Paper policy, which has been a most material part of our dis-inflation drive over the last two years, must now be reinforced. If we were nowto allow costs to rise as a result of higher wages and salaries, we should very rapidly deprive ourselves of all the advantages of our lowered exchange rate. TheWhite Paper must, therefore, be observed strictly, and it is only in the exeptional and genuine cases where some wage survives which, together with all the subsidies and social services, is insufficient to provide a family with a minimum reasonable standard of living, that there can be any possible excuse for going forward witha claim for an increase. -But even if such an increase is given to those at the bottom; we cannot acceptthe maintenance of differentials or relativities as any argument for presentincreases to those who are receiving higher rates. Especially and specificallythere can, in our view, be no justification for any section of workers trying to recoup themselves for any increase in the cost of living due to the altered exchange rate. That is a general burden spread over all, and must be accepted as a very real and essential contribution towards the avoidance of mass unemployment.
