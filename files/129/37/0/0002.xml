HhIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT     ,/t ,^^Bf  tl|l-^-?- y   ? f?&gt;Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1949I      SECRET Copy No.   31I i    CP. (49) 2021&amp;   UfA October,^fl HONG KONGMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIn CP. (49) 136 of 17th June, the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelations summarised the replies received up to that time from other Common-wealth Governments to our approach about Hong Kong.  As my colleagues willrecall, the preliminary view of the Canadian Prime Minister was strongly criticalH   of our intention to retain Hong Kong on the ground that it would be regarded ^^fl^^fl in North America as wrong in principle to endeavour to maintain British ruleby force in a Colony which was geographically part of China.   In his memo-randum of 17th June Mr. Noel-Baker emphasised that this was Mr. St. Laurent&apos;s^^R &apos; first reaction only.   Indeed, his views were given during a hurried week-endI       visit to Ottawa in the middle of an Election campaign, when, in view of theprevious history, it might have been very embarrassing for the Government if theI    issue of Hong Kong had been raised.fl 2.   Mr. St. Laurent promised to study the matter further and to let us havethe considered views of the Canadian Government later.  These have now beenreceived in the form of an aide-memoire dated 2nd September, which was handed^^fl to our High Commissoner at Ottawa, and which is reproduced as an Annex tothis paper.3. It will be seen that the Canadian Government fully appreciate thereasons why, in present circumstances, the United Kingdom has determined tomake of Hong Kong a point where it will demonstrate its intention to resistI       Communist aggression in the Far East, and hope that&apos;&apos; this decision of the UnitedH 1   Kingdom Government to defend Hong Kong will strengthen the will of all thethreatened countries of East Asia to resist Communist infiltration or overtaggression.&quot;   The Canadian Government also pledge their full support to theUnited Kingdom Government, should we feel obliged to draw the attention of theI Security Council to an attack on Hong Kong by the Chinese Communists.4. My colleagues will wish to be aware of the much more forthcoming| attitude now adopted by the Canadian Government, which is in refreshing? contrast to Mr. St. Laurent&apos;s first reactions.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,11th October, 1949.wi [p.t.o.^Hi 37693
ff ANNEXDepartment of External Affairs, Canada |JJH^^|Aide-memoire: Hong KongThe memorandum of 28th May, 1949, and related papers setting forth the Mconsiderations which impelled the United Kingdom Government to decide to sendreinforcements to Hong Kong, in order to be able to deal with any probable attackby the Chinese Communists, nave been studied carefully.The Canadian Government fully appreciates the reasons why the UnitedKingdom Government, under present circumstances, has determined to make ofHong Kong a point where it will demonstrate its intention to resist Communistaggression in the Far East. The threat of Communist domination over allSouth-East Asia carrier far-reaching implications for all free countries. It is^^^B to be hoped that this decision of the United Kingdom Government to defend^^^b Hong Kong will strengthen the will of all the threatened countries of East Asia |i|to resist Communist infiltration or overt aggression.It is noted from the papers prepared for the consideration pf the, United BVH^^^b Kingdom Government that emphasis, is placed, in preparing for the defence of :Y\hbb1BVMVJ Hong Kong, on not unduly provoking Chinese reaction.  The Canadian Govern- BVHment is in sympathy with this point of view.  An aspect of this question is theBvMVJ possibility that the Communists-might make use of the Hong Kong issue to BVHprovqke anti-British and anti-foreign agitation throughout China, which might 9^^^b well jeopardise the safety and welfare of all foreign nationals there.^^^?^ It is looted further that, should the Chinese Communists attack Hong Kong,^^^B^ the United Kingdom Government would draw this action to the attention of the^^^b Security Council of the United Nations.   In such circumstances the Canadiaij^^^B Government would lend its full support to the United Kingdom Government in^^^H the Security Council.It is realised; however, that in the United Nations the Soviet bloc mayHBVH endeavour to fit the Hong Kong issue into the framework of a general contention     H B^Hthat the Western Powers are denying to the inhabitants of Asiatic territories the^^^H right of self-determination and are standing in the way of the progress of Asiatic^^^?^ countries .to full freedom and independence. The Canadian Government, mindful^^^fl of the danger that this type of propaganda may meet with some success,, particu-^^^H larly in South-East Asia, would be glad to learn from the United Kingdom^^^H Government what line it is considering taking in the United Nations to counter^^^H the possible use of the Hong Kong issue by the Soviet bloc for propagandaBBBbI (Jto &gt;Je&apos;&apos;. . j JHBJ?^?H Ottawa, 2nd September, 1949. |t  JAB
