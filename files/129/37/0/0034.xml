S DOCUMENT  IS   THE   PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;8 . GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1949SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 234Hth November, 1949CABINETINDIA (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISION) BILL.Note of-Discussion with Sir Girja BajpaiMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsAs decided by the Cabinet at their meeting on 7th November (CM. (49)64th Conclusions, Minute 2) officials of the Departments concerned met Sir GirjaBajpai on 9th November. Tt appeared that he-had been informed;from Delhithat the Indian Cabinet wished to consider the; various questions, whichwere dealtwith in the Aide-Memoire communicated to him in October, a copy of which was attached to CP. (49) 224, after the return to (India of Pandit Nehru, and there-fore that he was not able to say what- the views of i the Government of india would be.2. It was explained to him that the information received from Delhi thatthe Government of India were likely to enact a citizenship law early in the NewYear and the very short time available in,which legislation could.be consideredby Parliament in the United Kingdom, had led Ministers here to take the viewthat:the,.proposed&apos;Bill should simply be a holding Bill, arid that any legislation which might be necessary to bring United Kingdom nationality law into line with the new position of India should be left over for the time&apos; being. Sir Girjaexpressed the view that thei Government of India.were themselves likely to be impressed by the ^difficulty of - reaching definite decisions,on these complex, issuesat a time when they were; fully occupied;with other, matters, notably the bringing into operation of their new Constitution. He: thought, therefore, that the proposal would be- acceptable&apos; to- them&apos; provided that: the; non-foreign position of indians in the-United Kingdoimand the Colonies could :meanwhile;be safeguarded.-3. An agreed record of the conversation is attached (Annex A). .It willbe-seen that&apos; it was explained to Sir Girja. that, the effect of such a!Bill:as was now contemplated in tne United&apos;Kingdom would be that Indian citizens would continue to British-subjects in the contemplation of the law of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies. Sir Girja thought that, even so, he would have a good chance of persuading his (Ministers to accept this position: as. a temporary situationpending nationality legislation both here and; dm India.4. The opportunity was taken, as &quot;desired by Ministers, to mention: toSir Girja Bajpai that the. effect of continuance of the existing situation would bethat;Indians would remain liable to be called up for National Service in theUnited Kingdom. On the understanding that persons temporarily resident inthe.United&quot; Kingdom, such as students, were normally exempt and-that in theevent of-war breaking out the Government of India would be consulted beforeIndians were conscripted, Sir Girja thought that continuance of the existing position would not be likely to. cause ^difficulty provided that public discussionof it could be avoided or kept to a minimum.5. Sir. Girja has decided to reportthe conversation personally on his returnto- India on.-14th&quot; November.. and not. to telegraph about it.   He was warned oi37850*3 f j
the extreme tightness of the Parliamentary programme here and will endeavourto obtain the views of the Government of India as speedily as possible. TheUnited Kingdom High Commissioner at Delhi is being instructed to keep in close touch with him.6. A revised Bill has been drafted by Parliamentary Counsel on the linesdesired and a copy is attached.P. J. N-B.Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1,lUh November, 1949.ANNEX ANote of an Informal Talk with Sir Girja Bajpai at the commonwealth relations Office on 9th november the following were present: Sir Girja Bajpai.Sir Percivale Liesching, Commonwealth Relations Office.Sir Norman Brook, Cabinet Office.Sir Alan Ellis, First Parliamentary Counsel.Mr. W. S. Murrie, Home Office.Mr. F. F. Turnbull, Commonwealth Relations Office.Mr. B. Cockram, Commonwealth Relations Office.Sir Girja Bajpai explained that he had received a telegram from Indiainforming him that the Cabinet would wish to consider the questions which were raised by the memorandum which had been given to him and of which a copy hadbeen passed to the Department of External Affairs. He was not therefore in aposition to say definitely what the views of the Government of India would be.Sir Percivale Liesching replied that he ought also to tell Sir Girja thatthere had been a slight change of position in the United Kingdom. ministers were inclined to think that the common-sense course would be for them to await the passage of the Indian citizenship law, which it was now understood wouldbe introduced into Parliament in India shortly after the new Constitution came into force, before attempting to decide exactly what legislation would be requiredto fit the existing United Kingdom nationality law to the new circumstances.For this reason they were inclined to confine themselves to the introduction ofa Bill which would continue the existing situation so far as India and Indianswere concerned and provide for such consequential amendment of existing legislation as might be immediately necessary by Orders in Council.Sir Norman Brook emphasised that this change of position related only to legislation dealing with nationality. Ministers recognised that it was essentialto introduce legislation to continue to India and to Indians the privileges whichthey at present enjoyed and which it was agreed at the April conference were,so far as possible, to be continued after India became a Republic. They had.however, had to amend the United Kingdom nationality legislation both in 1948and this year and they would prefer not to embark on further legislation in this field until they had more precise information about the proposed Indiancitizenship law. A further consideration was the extremely tight parliamentary programme; there were only a very few weeks left during which legislation could be passed by Parliament before 26th January.Sir Girja Bajpai said that the Government of India for their part would havefar too much to do in the next few weeks in connection with the completion ofthe constitution, &amp;c. to be able to give the consideration that would be necessaryto drafting a Citizenship Bill.   What was important therefore was that such
action should be taken as was necessary to ensure that Indians would not becomeforeigners, so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, during the interval.The position in the Colonies was also important from the Government of India&apos;spoint of view.Sir Percivale Liescking commented that the effect of a holding Bill would bethat Indians would remain, so far as United Kingdom law was concerned, Britishsubjects until the legal position was changed. He asked Sir Girja whether hethought that there would be any sentimental difficulty in India over the retentionof the status of Commonwealth citizen or British subject. He referred to theprovision in the Indian Constitution by which it was possible for Indiansresident abroad to register as Indian citizens. It was possible that the Govern-ment of India might, on consideration, welcome a few months&apos; delay during which such registration could take place.Sir Girja Bajpai said that it would obviously have been preferable to provide that Indians should be treated as, rather than that they should remain, Britishsubjects, but he thought that the proposal of United Kingdom Ministers wouldbe acceptable provided that existing United Kingdom nationality law included noexpress provisions about allegiance and that Indians could be described as Com-commonwealth citizens.Sir A lan Ellis replied that United Kingdom nationality law did not includeexpress provisions regarding allegiance.Sir Girja Bajpai recognised that some legislation would clearly be necessaryin the United Kingdom. He could see no objection to a terminable law whichwould have the effect of not altering the rights of Indians in the United Kingdomand Colonies, if the intention was to pass such a law. The substance could there-fore be conceded : what was left was the form of words by which effect could begiven to this policy in the United Kingdom. As regards the position of UnitedKingdom citizens in India, the provisions relating to citizenship in the indian constitution applied to Indians and not to other nationals; the position of all others, so far as he knew, was as before, and would remain so until an Indiancitizenship law was adopted. United Kingdom citizens would not be treatedas foreigners.Mr. Murrie asked whether Sir Girja Bajpai could give any estimate of whenthe Indian Citizenship Bill would be likely to be introduced.Sir Girja Bajpai thought that it would be necessary for the Bill to be passedas soon as possible and that the situation ought be cleared up within twelve months.Sir Percivale Liesching said that some information to this effect would be important to the climate of the debate in the United Kingdom Parliament.Sir Girja Bajpai explained that the criminal procedure code had includedspecial procedure for the trial of British subjects, other than Indians, in Indiaand that this procedure had been swept away. This procedure had, however,been in no way reciprocal (i.e., there was no special procedure for the trial of indians in the United Kingdom) and therefore its abolition did not affect thequestion of reciprocal treatment in future.Sir Alan Ellis thought that he should perhaps make clear to Sir Girja thatit was not contemplated that there should be any complete revision of the UnitedKingdom statutes applicable to India; andSir Norman Brook pointed out that, while further legislation would be needed to deal with nationality and certain other matters, there was a wide field,including, for example, trade preferences, where the general declaration whichwould be made in the proposed Bill would suffice. For this reason he thought thatthe United Kingdom Bill ought not to be a terminable one, though Sir Girja had used that phrase.Sir Girja Bajpai replied that, similarly, there was no complete revision being undertaken in India, where also all existing legislation would continue other thansuch laws as might be specifically abolished or revised. He had used the phrase&quot; terminable &quot; legislation as he thought that it was His Majesty&apos;s Government^intention to enact such legislation for the transition ,period.
&quot;Sir Percivale :LMs&apos;6hiriif. - repeated &apos;thEt what was in -mind was the possibilityof providing in the Bill !for such &apos; adaptation of ;existing legislation as might be necessary by Orders in Council. There was one&apos; other point to whichhe ought to draw Sir Girja&apos;s attention. The effect of the continuance of theexisting situation, as regards Indians in the United Kingdom, would be that they&apos;would remain subject to the requirement of National Service. He did riot thinkthat there was very much in this, since the numbers affected would be extremelysmall. It was, of Course, recognised that the Government of India would enjoyreciprocal rights in this respect.Sir Girja Bajpai thought1 that this was not a practical problem. He believedhe was correct in assuming that students and persons temporarily resident in theUnited Kingdom&apos;were normally exenipt.Sir Norman Brook confirmed that this was the position and emphasised1 that sir Girja could be assured that in the event of war breaking1 out there would beno conscription of Indian citizens without prior consultation with the Govern-ment of India.Sir Girja thought that on this basis&apos;the continuance of the existing positionwould not be likely to cause difficulty.   The less public discussion, the better.Mr. Murrie drew attention to the reference in the Aide-Memoire : to ! thedesirability of the&apos; Government of India requesting that&apos; their citizenship law should be regarded as a citizenship law for the purpose ofthe^British nationality act, 1948. He assumed that the Government of India would have no objection to carrying out this procedure in respect of the citizenship law which1&apos; they intended: to introduce.Sir Girja saw no difficulty in; principle. It was the normal procedure to give information for purposes of consultation before action. There could scarcely bean objection of principle to notifying the passage of legislation, i.e., to a communi-cation after action had been taken.Sir Girja said that he did not propose to telegraph any report of the meeting to Delhi, but that1 he would&apos;himself report on it after his return. -HeWOuld bein India by 14th November. It would be necessary for the matter to be studiedcarefully, but he recognised the importance of speed in this matter.Sir Norman Brook explained that the position so far as legislation in theUnited Kingdom was concerned was, roughly, that it would have to be passed before 16th December if it was to be passed at all before India became a &quot;Republic.The time-table was therefore very tight.mIB
