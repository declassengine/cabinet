THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,&apos; December 1949  flThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited    It is issued for the personal use of top SECRET I   Copy No.   31CP. (49) 2458thDecember, 1949 -,. ,&apos;. . ,cabinet defence ESTIMATES, 1950-51Memorandum by the Prime minister the size of the defence budget for 1^50^51 has recently been investigated bythe Defence Committee and I now bring before the Cabinet the upshot of their discussions.2. My colleagues will recall that when, on 24th January, we approved a totalof  760 million for the defence estimates 1949-50 (CM. (49) 6th Conclusions,Minute 1) it was agreed that the Minister of Defence should in due course bring&apos;before the Defence Committee a fully co-ordinated plan for the future defence ofthe country. By arrangement with the Minister, the Chiefs of Staff entrusted thefirst stage of this study to an inter-Service Working Party, who were invited toconsider how an annual defence budget limited to  700 million for the three yearsbeginning April&apos;1950, could best be distributed and what the effects on the fighting strength of the Forces would be. The report suggested many useful economies, butshowed that &apos;the effect of reducing the defence budget to anything in theneighbourhood of  700 million* couldrnot &apos;f ail to be of a mosfciserious character,necessitating major withdrawals all over the World, and equivalent in the politicalfield to a major.disaster in the &quot; cold war/&apos;    1        . 1    13. A new start was required and the Minister of Defence, assisted by theService Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, proceeded to work out new proposals forthe three years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53; designed to avoid the worst of these difficulties. These proposals, which for the first time took the form of a properlyco-ordinated plan, aimed .at mitigating or eliminating the most damagingreductions inevitable under the inter-Service working party&apos;s proposals; and atavoiding default on our obligations under Western Union and the Atlantic Pactwithout placing an intolerable burden on the Exchequer.4.   The main features of the Minister&apos;s proposals, set out at Annex A,are as follows :-(i) Emphasis is placed on winning the &quot; cold war,&apos;&apos; the underlying thoughtbeing that if we succeed in this we may avoid being called upon to fight Iany other kind of war;  (ii) The three main pillars of our strategy are defined, as in earlier studies, Ias the defence of the United Kingdom, of our sea communications, and $of our position in the Middle East;* Subsequent detailed examination  of the report showed that the Committee^ proposals would cost about  50 million more than their initial estimate.37978SB!H1m
(iii) They include an estimate by the Chiefs of Staff of the minimum forces required, and a definition of our requirements on a functional basis inthe following order of urgency : -(a) success in the &quot; cold war;&quot;(b) defence of the United Kingdom against air attack;(c) security of sea communications;(d) retention of the Middle East;(e) provision of forces for Western Union;(/) general build-up for an ultimate offensive.Details are given in the reports at Annexes B and C.(iv) Full account is taken of the economy measures which are now being implemented as recently announced in the House of Commons. These,as my colleagues will recall, included reduction in headquarters staffs,training, maintenance and administrative establishments and in theworks programme. All the suggestions for economy proposed by theinter-Service working party which were found to be practicable havebeen adopted and in many cases where the working party&apos;s suggestionscould not be put into practice alternative economies have been found.These measures will secure economy on a substantial scale, though some of the steps involved \e.g., the closing down of the Naval dock-yard at Bermuda and the drastic reduction in the Naval installationat Trincomalee) may give rise to political difficulties.(v) The plan aims at reducing the man-power in the Services from 739,000(at which it stands at present)-By 1st April, 1950. to 726,000.By 1st April, 1951, to 682,000.By 1st April, 1953, to 677.750.(yi) The Ministers proposals involve the acceptance of some serious risks(see paragraph 12 of Annex A) :-(a) Reliance on a considerable period of warning -before the outbreakof war.   We may not get this warning.(&amp;) The Air Force is comparatively small and its reserves would not last for more than a month of fighting.(c) The impossibility of reinstating the Royal Air Force component of the Berlin Air Lift owing to a two-third reduction in thepresent strength of our air transport forces at home.(d) The lack of any margin with which to cope with any intensificationin the &quot; cold war.&quot;(e) Inability to ,press on at the desired speed with the research anddevelopment on which we rely for our lead in all forms of technical equipment.(vii) Taken as a whole, the Minister&apos;s proposals offer the prospect of con-tinuing (with American - co-operation) to meet our principalresponsibilities throughout the world and in particular of providing the forces needed for the &quot; cold war &quot; at its present intensity.5. After taking account of the economies referred to in paragraph 4 (iv), theMinister&apos;s proposals for the three years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 amountto  810 million per year. This is a substantial increase over the  760 millionvoted for the defence budget for 1949-50. The principal factors which make anincrease of this kind inevitable are the heavy expenditure to which we are committed in connection with Western Union extra production, the fall of about 20 million in appropriations-in-aid (largely due to dwindling sales of surplus war equipment) and additional commitments such as the reinforcements forHong Kong. The Minister &apos;s proposals take no account of devaluation, and anadditional sum (not yet evaluated precisely but probably between  15 million and  20 million) would have to be added to the  810 million.6. In the course of the Defence Committee&apos;s discussion the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that in present economic and financial circumstances it was
impossible for him to meet in full the cost of the Minister of Defence&apos;s proposals.The Committee therefore directed their attention to the possibility of securingsome reduction in the Ministers figure. &apos;The possible discarding of responsibilities - ...    *      &apos;.7. The Defence Committee first considered whether the problem could notbe eased by discarding some of our existing responsibilities.8. The provision made in the Minister&apos;s plan for the defence of the UnitedKingdom, particularly the provision made for air defence where the risk of defeatwould be most immediate in the event of war, cannot be regarded as excessive forthe purpose.9. In Western Europe our Armed Forces are discharging the responsibilities which flowed from our victory in the recent war and are at the same time playingtheir role under Western Union and so helping to build up a united and resoluteWestern Europe as the first line of defence against another war. Any contractionof our efforts in this area would have most serious political consequences.10. In the Far East our task is to hold back the Communist threat and toprevent its spread over South-East Asia. This is an area of immense economicsignificance to the Western world in general and to the United Kingdom inparticular.  We cannot do less without pulling out altogether.11. Finally, there is the Middle East. This is an area which the Chiefsof Staff regard as vital from the strategic point of view, and it is an area in which our armed forces are fulfilling far more than a military role. They providestability in an area which, like the Far East, is of vital economic consequence tous; they occupy a position in the centre of the Commonwealth and of the Moslemworld, withdrawal from which could hardly fail to split the Empire and leadeventually to the loss of Africa to the Communists. The Committee agreed,therefore, that there, could be no question of our withdrawing from the middle east. They were, however, of the opinion that, as war does not at presentappear imminent and as reinforcements could be sent out from the UnitedKingdom at fairly short notice if required, there was a case for making a smallreduction in the size of the present peace-time garrison in the Middle East.Orders have accordingly been given that the British forces in Tripolitania shouldbe reduced to the numbers required to provide for internal security, the forcesthus released being returned to the United Kingdom.12. Thus the Defence Committee came to the conclusion that they could not recommend the discarding of any of our main responsibilities as a means of easingthe problem.A administrative Economies13. The Defence Committee next considered whether there was hope of achieving the same military effect more cheaply by exercising greater drive andimagination in the matter of administrative economies. The plan put forward by the Minister of Defence is the end product of a study of the size and shape of the Armed Forces which has been in progress for the past year. During thisperiod a continuous whittling process has been at work and the Service Depart-ments have been forced to make certain drastic economies in order to get withinthe proposed financial limits. Service Departments would not have proposed someof the economies put forward for example, the reduction in the scale of war reserves and the size of the air transport force if less damaging alternatives hadbeen available.National Service14. The Defence Committee considered the possibility of achieving economyeither by abolishing National Service or by changing its character. They were satisfied that neither suggestion is practicable. The Army and Air Force rely on National Service for a little less than half the total number of men now serving with the colours. Without it, therefore, neither the Army nor the RoyalAir Force could discharge their present responsibilities. The required numberscould not be found by increasing the intake of Regulars because volunteers are
10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,8th December, 1949.not obtainable in sufficient numbers. Indeed, the problem at present is to main-tain our existing force of Regulars. Changes in the character of National Service,in the direction of adopting some form of Selective Service, are politicallyob j ectionable.Equipment15. Finally, the Defence Committee discussed the provision made for equip-ment in the Minister of Defence&apos;s plan. Some increase&apos; in 1950-51 over theprovision made for equipment last year is inevitable. War stocks, on which somuch reliance has hitherto been placed and for the sale of which we have in thepast received substantial sums, are running out and new orders must be placed;there must be some modest expenditure on modernisation if the equipment ofthe Services is not to grow progressively out of date; and we are committed to aconsiderable programme of production in connection with Western Union. TheCommittee agreed, however, to look very closely at the equipment programmes of all three Services. ;Defence Committee&apos;s general conclusion16. After studying the Minister of Defence:s proposals in detail the DefenceCommittee as a whole concluded that it would be very difficult to meet the fullBill which he had submitted. They agreed instead to recommend to the Cabinet-&apos;&apos; That the provision for defence in the 1950-51 Estimates should amountto  780 million, on the understanding that if this amount was shown to be insufficient to meet the expenditure on essential equipment which the DefenceCommittee might hereafter agree to be necessary for the Services, thenecessary balance should be made by way of supplementary estimates. no work should be undertaken which would require finance by supplementary estimate without the approval of the Defence Committee being firstobtained.&quot;17.   The Minister of Defence proposed a three-year defence budget, but in* present circumstances it is difficult for the Government to commit themselvesbeyond the year 1950-51.18. As my colleagues are aware, when announcing the recent economy measures in the House of Commons and making public the decision to cut the1949-50 defence expenditure at the annual rate of  30 million, I reserved ourposition in respect of the 1950^-51 defence budget. After listening to thediscussions in the Defence Committee I am satisfied that bearing in mind ourwide responsibilities, we cannot make a smaller financial provision than that now suggested by the Defence Committee. In reaching, this conclusion, I haveparticularly in mind the obligations we have assumed under the Brussels treaty and the Atlantic Pact. I am confident that the development of an integrateddefence plan under these two treaties will strengthen our ability and that of our allies not only to resist aggression but, what is more important, to prevent war.All the countries concerned are, however, in varying degrees lacking in equipment or trained man-power and, until these deficiencies have been made good,co-ordinated planning, necessaiy as it is for true defence, cannot be expectedto reduce the current levels of defence expenditure.19.   I accordingly invite the Cabinet: (1) To  endorse  the conclusion of  the  Defence  Committee  quoted  inparagraph 16 above.(2) To take note of the general strategic conception on which the provisionfor defence will be based, as outlined by the Chiefs of Staff in annex C, and the particular military risks which are involved,as outlined in paragraph 4 of this paper,(3) To ask the Minister of Defence to bring forward his proposal for athree-year defence budget on some future occasion.C.

TOP secret copy No.ANNEX A[D.O. (49) 6618th October, 1949.]THE REQUIREMENTS OF NATIONAL DEFENCE : SIZE AND shape of THE ARMED FORCES 1950-53Memorandum by the Minister of DefenceIntroductoryMy colleagues will be aware that, ever since the institution of the Ministryof Defence in January 1947, an unremitting effort has been made with the advice of the Chiefs of Staff to elaborate for the approval of Ministers a comprehensivelong-term plan for the three Services to which current expenditure could be related. I now present to my colleagues a 3-Service scheme covering the threeyears 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53-the full details of which will be foundin the Reports by an Inter-Departmental Committee* and by the Chiefs of Staff.tThe scheme contemplates an expenditure of  810 million:): on defence in each of thethree years to which it relates. Expenditure on the scale of  810 million per annum in our present financial state may seem a lot of money to spend on defence, andI must&quot; therefore at the outset explain some of the main reasons which leadme to propose such a sum, not merely as reasonable, but as the inescapable mini-mum consistent with the maintenance of our world position.Basic consider at,ions-the Objective2. Armed Forces are not an end in themselves. They represent the power,actual and potential, which a nation thinks it prudent and necessary to maintainto support its policy or policies. Since the War ended we have had three mainpolicy objectives: First. To provide security for our people against aggression the first duty of any Government.Second. To sustain our foreign policy, including the maintenance of adequate occupation forces in Germany and resistance to the onrush of communist influence at the various points of contact Greece, Trieste,Malaya, Hong Kong, &amp;c; and third. To achieve the most rapid development practicable of our over-seas possessions, since without such Colonial development there can be no major improvement in the standard of living of our own people at home.3.   From the desire to achieve these ends derives the level and structure ofthe Armed Forces which have had to be maintained.   I remind the Committeeof how the Services have had over the past four years to conform to the shiftsand chances of policy as it has developed. Coincident with the rapid demobilisa-tion of our forces which was essential for economic recovery the foreign secretary set himself to reach an understanding with our principal Allies whichwould have included the full development of the provisions of the United nations charter for the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations and the steadyreduction of the burden of armaments.   Patient and persistent efforts in thisdirection have met with repeated frustration. Four years from V.J. Day we havenot peace, but the phenomenon known as the Cold-War. During that period theattitude of Russia has meant disturbance the world over, and we have been em-broiled at many points. Yet resistance to the spread of the influence of Moscow isa cardinal, if not the cardinal, feature of our policy and that of our friendsat this time. In pursuit of this policy the Armed Forces have been obliged-^des-pite all the disorganisation consequent on rapid demobilisation to spreadeaglethemselves across the globe in order to hold many of the outposts of democracy.* Annex B. t Annex C.j This estimate was prepared before de-valuation. (See paragraph 16.)37949 b
The pressure on each of the three Services created by these unstable conditions-producing in each its own particular problems made it virtually impossible&apos;-toreach any co-ordinated long-term plan for all three Services.Some General Propositions4. Before turning to the current proposals I should like to enunciate anumber of general propositions which affect the preparation of Service plans and estimates at the present time, if only to dispel some of the misconceptions currentabout Armed Forces expenditure not all of which are confined to our political opponents.(a) The problem of &quot; teeth and tail.&quot; It is a common habit for critics the leader of the Opposition among them -to point to pre-war Serviceexpenditure and to imply that, even allowing for increased costs, muchcurrent expenditure on the Services must be wasteful, since the avail-able fighting units -regiments, ships, squadrons -are markedly lessnumerous than before the war. This argument ignores the increasingcomplexity of modern equipment in all three Services which has ledinevitably, not merely to increased manning requirements per equip-iheht, but to a great increase in base establishments for servicing andmaintenance and also for training personnel in its efficient use. Radaralone has introduced a new and very exacting requirement in theServices. The modern heavy bomber does hot merely need a bigger crewto operate it, but also makes a very much heavier demand on the groundstaff than its predecessor. The modern destroyer requires a. crewabout one-third stronger than her pre-war counterpart of comparablemain armament. There is thus no valid comparison to be dr*awn ohthis basis with the forces provided for any given outlay of money.   ,(b) Rising nost of equipment.-!?)^ cost of the provision of all this vastlymore complicated equipment is also important. Current requirementscan no longer be met from war-time stocks and we are confronted withthe formidable problem of gradual re-equipment with modern weapons.The cost of both raw materials and finished products over the whole range of stores and equipment has risen sharply since the War. Wecannot measure up to the potential enemy in number of men and wemust offset this deficiency in the only way we can, namely by out-stripping him in the technique and performance of our equipment. it follows that it is of the highest importance that we should aim atequipping whatever forces we maintain atja high standard Of technicalquality. Since the War we have recognised this in the priority given to defence research.(c) Increased pay allowances and costs of maintenance-The wage bill of thethree Services has increased enormously since 1938 as a result of in-creases granted during the war, their consolidation into the New pay code of 1946 and subsequent further increases in line with the generalrise in civilian wages since then. For example, the gross emolumentsof a private soldier in 1938 were  153 per annum, they are  289 to-day, an increase of 89 per cent. Comparable figures for a lieutenantare  292 in 1938,  481 in 1949, ah increase of 6&amp; per cent. The costof maintaining a man in the forces his food, clothing and accommb-dation have increased proportionately. The charges for personnel are a very heavy item in Service budgeting-approximately one-thirdof the total: and are not susceptible of reduction.(d) The growing importance of the air arm. The rise of the R.A.F. to fullstature beside the older Services adds another new element to costs.The disappearance of the traditional concept of an island protected by sea power alone which could always guarantee us the time ih which to prepare for a land campaign after the outbreak of War is now generally accepted. What is less generally understood is that, for all its advances over the last, thirty years, air power, even as we knowit to-day, is not only, developing still greater responsibilities but alsoits ability to meet those responsibilities. The last war ended withthe dropping of the atomic bomb and the introduction of the turbo-jet engine both of these will undoubtedly have far reaching cohse-quences.
(e) The Loss of the Indian Army. The effect on Army organisation of the granting of self-government to India and Pakistan; is often over-looked. For here was a highly trained expandable reserve on whichwe could count in time of emergency or war. While the cost of thisArmy to the United Kingdom in peace was relatively small, it was adefinite factor in our potential military strength.(/) National Service Man-power. The National Service system, thoughessential in present circumstances, is, and must be, an expensive wayof &quot;providing manpower to meet current needs. Of the bptal Rerio$of service a substantial proportion is spent in training. Mpreoyerjthe fact that National Service men have to be used overseas, where their period of service must be short, increases transportation and! similaroverhead costs.(g) The level of expenditure in relation to Western Union and the No,rtftA atlantic Pact. Superficially there is ground for suggesting that t$econclusion of these agreements with like-minded Powers should leaddirectly to some relief of our burdens. So they might, if we had entered into an association with fully armed States, but it is useless to burke the fact that, Canada ancl the United States apart, all our allies in these agreements are either painfully rebuilding their forcesafter the war or, like Portugal and Iceland, have a negligible military strength. In common with us they face the need to make gppd thteireconomic recovery at the same time. Far from these agreementsleading to a reduction of defence expenditure, therefore, they may even entail some increase in pur outlay for some time to come. Quite,apart from the specific Western Union programme, which is attractingassistance in cash and kind from the United States, it must be pla;^that these pacts entail moral obligations to our allies not to suffer a,reduction in our capacity to contribute to the common defence. Thepacts may be expected, as time goes on, to lead to some adjustment^of expenditure by the participants in order to secure the best^possible-distribution of effort, and in so far as British types of equipment arestandardised we may gain economically as well as in terms of war potential. But it would be quite wrong to look for any early net reduction of expenditure. We are seeking with our friends to establishin present world conditions a new concept I might call it thePax Atlantica. To do this we must ourselves do what we shallencourage others to do according to their resources that is to take our proper part in an integrated international scheme of defence andcontribute our fair share to the &quot; hard core in being &quot; of the forcesit demands. And if the price is heavy, how much nipre terrible forour people would be the price of failure not in terms of money alonebut in the destruction of life and perhaps of our democratic society too.(h) The need for a greater effort by the self-governing Dominions. It is often tempting to think, when an effort is called for, that &apos;&apos; the otherfellow &quot; is not pulling his weight. So it is with the Dominions. Wehave given them and shall continue to give them every encouragement to develop their forces Australia with her five-year programme, NewZealand with her recent decision on conscription and Canada with hersubstantial research programme and air defence scheme have shown some signs of responding. But while we can encourage the freecountries of the Commonwealth to develop their defence forces, wecanot command them. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that we can transfer to them anything substantial of our presentburdens.(j) Defence effort in relation to national income. Probably the best com-parison which can be drawn, in view of the great change in moneyvalues and the structure of the national budget with the scale of effortpre-war, is the proportion of aggregate national income which is devoted to defence. In 1938 we devoted about 8 per cent, of our national income to defence and the figure is very much the same in1949. There is no comparison which can be drawn on this basis withthe years immediately after World War I; then there was no possibleenemy in Europe who could in any way threaten us now one of our37949 b 2
former allies exhibits all the symptoms of the potential aggressor. Noone can claim that the world to-day is in a markedly more peacefulcondition than in 1938; we should certainly not devote less of our resources to defence now than then.History of Recent Discussions5. For the year 1948-49 my colleagues will recall that the Defence Budgetwas fixed in the spring of 1948 at  693 million, including  60 million of terminalexpenditure. We decided, when the Berlin situation became acute, to institute a modest re-equipment programme and to retain additional men with the Colours.The effect of these decisions matured in 1949-50, when a Budget of  760 million,including about  14 million terminals, was agreed. This will now be exceeded,due to the special measures in connection with Hong Kong and the additionalWestern Union production programme. It was in the course of the discussionslast autumn that the Chancellor of the Exchequer pressed me strongly to have prepared a long-term defence plan designed to keep our annual financial provisionunder this head down to  700 million. To enable this to be done and with myapproval the Chiefs of Staff set up an inter-Service Committee with a civilianchairman to draw up a plan showing what forces should and could be maintained on this figure over the three years 1950-53. This body was the Harwood Com-mittee, whose report was submitted to the Chiefs of Staff in March last. In June,after careful examination, the Chiefs of Staff reported that they agreed generally with the Committee&apos;s line of approach to the problem remitted to them and thatit would be impossible on  700 million to maintain larger forces than theCommittee proposed. Indeed, subsequent Departmental scrutiny had alreadyrevealed that the Harwood proposals would in fact cost over  750 million. TheChiefs of Staff took the view that the implications of the proposals were so graveand involved the taking of such risks and the abandonment of so many hithertounchallenged commitments that they had no alternative but to seek Ministerialguidance as to which of the risks could be accepted politically.6. The following is a brief statement of the consequences which would have resulted from acceptance of the Harwood proposals : (a) inability to give anything like a satisfactory answer on the UnitedKingdom contribution to Western Union Forces in the next few years;(6) reduction of our Occupation Forces in Germany by April 1951 from58,000 to 47,900 and complete withdrawal from Austria and Triesteby that date with a further reduction of British troops in germany by 1953 to one division (21,600);(c) the reduction of our air strength to a point at which the R.A.F. could take virtually no part in strategic bombing in addition to carryingout its other necessary tasks, with the result that we should have little to offer by way of offset to our limited land forces contribution to western Union;(d) a visible reduction of striking forces of all arms at the very time whenthe Atlantic Pact Organisation is being developed and the UnitedStates are preparing to contribute heavily in money and equipment for the strengthening of the democratic Powers;(e) reliance upon the United States for the defence of the Middle East inwar except for initial covering forces, and reliance on the UnitedStates Navy for the control of sea communications in the Mediter-ranean a policy which subsequent developments have shown to bebased on false assumptions as to American strategic conceptions;(/) reduction of our forces in the Middle East to a level barely sufficient forgarrison purposes; there would have been no kind of reserve for usein emergency. The loss of our whole position in this area and in the territories farther East to which it is the key would surely follow;(g) withdrawal of all United Kingdom forces in peace from the West Indies,South America, South Africa and the Indian Ocean;(A) a proposal to hand over to Australia and New Zealand responsibility for naval forces in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean a respon-sibility which they were in no position to accept and which wouldcertainly have led to serious political difficulties;
(j) the reduction of our garrisons overseas to a point at which they wouldhave been capable of little more than providing for internal security,and a reduction of Naval.forces overseas on which we have alwaysrelied for the rapid reinforcement of threatened points; and(Jc) at Home, the abandonment of defence installations, including dockyardsat Portland, Sheerness and possibly Chatham, and the disbandment of no less than 43 regular regiments in the Army and also of theRoyal Marines. The acceptance of ,such reductions would have shown to the world a serious decline in our military strength and would havehad a deplorable effect both in this country and abroad.7. A preliminary and, at that time, inconclusive discussion of the situationtook place under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship on 5th July last. Beingconvinced myself that no acceptable plan could be devised on the basis of a moneyallocation of  700 million, it seemed to me that the most constructive action i could take would be to discover at what minimum level it would be possible toforeshadow a Defence Budget which, while taking account of all practicableeconomies and proposals by the Harwood Committee and of constant pruningof administrative costs, would permit the avoidance of the worst of the resultsdetailed above. The defence budget approved for 1949-50 is  760 million towhich must be added commitments which we have incurred under the western union arrangements and obligations which we have already assumed in regardto the defence of Hong Kong. Moreover, the findings of the Harwood Committeeand the investigations which followed it made it very plain that, at the present level of expenditure, we are failing to make even the minimum provision forre-equipment necessary to avoid a progressive decline in the fighting quality of our forces. Considering the problem as a whole I felt it to be unrealistic to suppose that any acceptable solution could be sought on a level of less than 800 million. In these circumstances I considered it necessary to initiate afresh study on different assumptions, the main features of which were -(i) A limit on the annual estimates of  800 million, plus a margin of 10 million for contingencies;(ii) A higher priority to the requirements of the Cold War, even if this involved spreading our re-equipment programme over a somewhatlonger period than up to 1957; and(iii) Service man-power to be reduced to 700,000 by 31/3/51 and to 650,000by 31/3/53.8. These assumptions reflected my view, from which I think my colleagues will not dissent, that the dominating feature of world policy to-day is the cold war and that it would be wrong, for the sake of realising our full strength ata later date, to compromise our ability to wage it. My suggestion as regardsman-power was aimed at achieving a practical compromise between continuingwith man-power on the present scale (i.e., in the neighbourhood of 750,000), whichis clearly beyond our means if reasonable provision is to be made for re-equippingthem, and on the other hand of accepting a programme of the character outlined in the Harwood Committee report involving a fall to some 565,000 men andwomen, which subsequent analyses had shown to be unacceptable if the require-ments of the Cold War were to be met.9. In response to these instructions the two reports (Annexes B and C) havebeen prepared. The first is the report of an inter-Service Working Party onthe Defence Budget over the next three years prepared in the light of the seconddocument which is a study by the Chiefs of Staff Committee of the strategicaspects of the matter.10. I consider that these reports represent an important advance towardssecuring a practical and acceptable policy for defence. Their main features maybe summarised as follows : (i) The keynote of the plan is the emphasis it places on winning the Cold Warwith the underlying thought that if this is done we may hope not to becalled upon to fight any other kind of war. The practical effect ofthis principle is that the Army, which cannot simultaneously bear itspresent burden in the Cold War and prepare for a major war, will give
priority to the former. In the Navy and Air Forge, where the sameconflict does not arise to the same extent, the Chiefs of Staff advise that the requirements for a major war should take precedence.(ii) The Chiefs of Staff, as in earlier studies, define the three main pillarsof our strategy as the defence of the United Kingdom, of our sea communications and of our position in the Middle East. The defence services must be organised to coyer the requirements of the Cold Warand in co-operation with our allies in war to secure the main pillarsof our strategy.(iii) The Chiefs of Staff proceed to analyse the main ways in which a russian offensive would be directed and on the basis of this study and of prin-ciples (i) and (ii) above they place such defence requirementsfunctionally in the following order of priority : (a) Success in the Cold War;(b) The defence of the United Kingdom against air attack;(c) The security of sea communications vital to the United Kingdom,and of the approaches to our ports and harbours against miningattack;id) The retention of the Middle East;(e) The provision of forces for Western Europe; and(/) The general build up for an ultimate offensive.11. The effect of translating this policy into actual forces is described inparagraph 19 of the Chiefs of Staff Report (D.O. (49) 65). It will be noted that inconsequence of the more adequate man-power figures which flow from the largerbudgetary limit it is possible to avoid the following undesirable features of theHarwood Report: (a) The rolling up of units of the Army on the scale described in para-graph 6 (k) above and the decline of our Cold War effort which would inevitably follow from the reduction of our overseas garrisons inGermany and elsewhere;(b) The lamentable effect on world opinion of large reductions in the armed forces, in particular on the Atlantic Pact and Brussels Treaty Powers.(c) The sharp decline in our position as a world Power which would followon the reduction of our overseas garrisons and armed forces abroad,for example the scaling down of our forces in the Far East (which isin any case quite impracticable at present); the withdrawal of allUnited Kingdom forces in Greece, the West Indies,, South America,South Africa; and the withdrawal of naval forces from the East Indies-(d) The adverse effect on recruitment and on contentment in the Services ofthese large-scale withdrawals and disbandments.12. It is important that the Committee should understand that the schemewhich T now present involves the acceptance of a number of serious risks. the gravest among them is the fact that we should be in no position to face a waremergency unless a period of warning could be counted upon during which ourrearmament programme could be greatly accelerated. This feature runs throughthe whole programme as it inevitably must in any programme keyed to an exactingfinancial limit. If we are to be more ready for a major war at short notice the CDstwould rise steeply.   Other risks are : (i) The small size of the Air Force in relation to its tasks in war. fighter command, even when expanded as proposed in the programme, willattain between one-third and one-half of the strength recommended bythe Air Defence Committee. The size of Bomber Command and indeed of the front line generally bears a similar relation to its commit-ments. Moreover, the prospective lack of reserves of equipment will be accompanied by a nearly complete absence of reserves of air crew. Ifwar were to come without a considerable warning period during whichreserves and productive capacity could be built up, our air forces wouldnot survive more than a month of intensive fighting.
(ii) An increase in the intensity of the Gold War would find us withoutthe forces necessary to meet the threat. Experience ih the Far Eastduring recent months has shown the dangers which this would involve.(iii) At sea, the much reduced strength of the peacetime Navy would consider-ably slow up the speed of mobilisation of the fleet, while the strengthof our maritime Air Forces would only provide for limited air cover for the sea approaches to the United Kingdom.(iv) On land our forces in the Middle East would be dangerously inadequate,and during the next few years we could not provide any land reinforce-ments for the initial battle in Western Europe,(v) It would be necessary to abolish Transport Command, RAF., and toreduce the air transport in the United Kingdom by two-thirds. Thiswould make it impossible to re-instate the R.A.F. component of the berlin Air Lift.(vi) So far as the Ministry of Supply aspect is concerned not only will there-equipment of the Fortes be delayed but the development of new orimproved weapons and aircraft will be materially set back. A risinglevel of expenditure on research and development had been envisaged by current Service requirements and in the plans made by the Ministryof Supply to meet them, but the allocation of money now proposed for the Ministry of Supply does not provide for the necessary increase.13. The Defence Committee will note that it has not been possible to meetcompletely the man-power limits referred to in paragraph -7, namely 700,000: by 1st April, 1951, and 650;000 by 1st April, 1953. The actual strengths postulatedin the plan are :- By 1st April, 1951    ......      .........      682,000By 1st April, 1953   .................      677,750The short-fall ih 1951 is tb be welcomed from the man-power point of view.I am satisfied that the excess of some 25,000 in the target for 1st April, 1953, is unavoidable.14.   The figures of National Service intake on this basis will be : Intake for 1950-51    ......      .........      158,550Intake for 1951-52   ...      ...      .........      170,690Intake for 1952-53......      ...      ...      ...      164,700It would appear, therefore, that the problem of controlling the NationalService intake is not going to be so grave as was supposed when the Harwoodreport was first under discussion, and it may well be possible to avoid any radicaladjustment in the scheme in order to control the intake and to absorb any sUplusby deferring one or two additional registrations over the next three years.15. I draw attention to the recommendation made by the Working party that, within the total allocations to each Department, adjustments between oneyear and another should be permitted. I recognise that serious difficulties inprinciple for the Chancellor or the Exchequer are involved here. Equally, however,regard mUst.be paid to the difficulty of ensuring that payments fall due at theproper date for a programme as complex as that which we are now discussing.To tell the Service Departments that money which cannot be spent by a prescribeddate must be surrendered to the Exchequer and become a complete loss to thethree-year scheme, is to make a difficult problem into an intractable one. It is most important that ways and means should be found of giving effect to thisproposal.16. All these proposals were worked out before devaluation took place. Theextent of the adjustment entailed is not yet known, but it will be essential thatthe additional money required to cover any increases1 should be provided.Conclusion17. The proposals now before the Committee in the Reports of the working party and of the Chiefs of Staff represent the culmination of many months of intensive work. They are the outcome of a thorough-going attempt to evolve a balanced three-Service plan and represent an integrated defence scheme which
will take us over the next three years. The forces we shall have, if the plan is approved, are not as large as those which the Chiefs of Staff consider necessary on purely military grounds, but equally, they are not so small as to lead to thefrustration, if not abandonment, of some of the major objectives of our foreignpolicy, such as would have been entailed by the Harwood proposals. Risks considerable risks will still have to be taken; numerically smaller forces; theslowing-up of Army re-equipment in order to concentrate on its Cold War role;and, in particular, the reduction of the air forces far below the level which weshould normally deem prudent. If a major war came with inadequate warning,these risks would be particularly grave. To counterbalance these we shall andmust develop a substantial arms export trade to enable us to maintain the indus-trial war potential on which we can call and, if necessary, rapidly expand in emergency.18. Over all these anxious studies of the pattern of our defence services inthe next few years there has loomed the thought of what was the proper burdenthat the country should be asked to carry in its own interests and also in thecommon interest of the peoples who share our political, religious and culturalinheritance. Put shortly, the problem has seemed to me to be whether, after the exhaustion of the war years, the United Kingdom has the power and the resources to maintain armed forces equipped to modern standards such as are required topermit us to play the part of a Great Power. I have always conceded, in public and in private, that the prime necessity for our survival is that we should win the battle for economic recovery. That is fundamental. But what is no less important is to ensure that, in taking the necessary measures to deal with theeconomic situation, no such crippling penalties are inflicted upon the service as would render them inefficient for their manifold current duties and incapable of forming the basis of rapid expansion in time of war. For armed forces areorganic bodies they cannot be mutilated to-day and be recreated by the pen andthe cheque book to-morrow. Drastic measures now would work themselves outinexorably in the years ahead when we as individuals have passed from the scene.Principally, owing to British initiative,Western Union has come into being and,though still far from having reached its full potential, is already a factor in theworld. From this basis the United States have gone on to accept wide responsi-bilities under the Atlantic Pact and the present programmes of military aid.Failure to approve the proposals I am now putting forward will make itimpossible to redeem the promises we have made to our allies, and thus, in myopinion, imperil the whole structure we have been building up together.To my mind the essence of the matter is this. Only by avoiding war can we hope to realise our economic strength; if war should come, we shall surely loseall that we have planned and struggled for in the last few years. To avoid warour best hops lies in the provision of adequate defence services which afford clear evidence to the world of our strength, determination and resolve.Recommendation19.   I accordingly invite the Committee (a) to endorse the proposal that a sum of  810 million (with any upwardadjustment rendered necessary by the devaluation of the  ) be allocated to defence in each of the three financial years 1950-51,1951-52, 1952-53;(6) to approve the underlying strategic conceptions on which it is based asset out by the Chiefs of Staff; and(c) to seek the approval of the Cabinet to the proposals outlined in the tworeports..A.

ANNEX B[D.E./P. (49) 17]Inter-Departmental Committee on Defence EstimatesReportThe Committee was set up to prepare for the consideration of Ministers aco-ordinated Defence Budget for three years from April 1950 to March 1953.Our terms of reference placed a limit of  810 million annually on defence expenditure over this three-year period and laid down that the uniformed man-power strength of the Forces should be reduced to 700,000 by 31st March, 1951,and to 650,000 by 1952-53.2. In submitting its preliminary report on 15th August, the Committeedrew attention to the fact that, after all possible savings had been made,departmental estimates of the minimum expenditure necessary to provide for present planned forces so far exceeded  810 million annually, particularly towardsthe end of the three-year period, that no agreed allocation of money amongdepartments could then be put forward. Further progress depended uponstrategic guidance from the Chiefs of Staff, which would indicate in whichServices and in what proportions cuts should be made and risks taken. A seriesof questions, aimed at obtaining this guidance in a form which would enable theCommittee to proceed with its task, were accordingly put to the Chiefs of Staff.3.   Subsequent discussions by the Chiefs of Staff and in the Committee have resulted in agreement as to where the necessary reductions can best be made sofar as expenditure by the Service Departments themselves is concerned.    the resultant allocation oi resources would give an average annual defence budget of 810 million over the next three years provided that it proves possible to ensurethat there is no more than a moderate rise in the defence element of Ministry ofSupply expenditure.   During the present year this amounts to  57 - 75 million.Estimates for the three years ahead are, however,  66 million,  72 million and 74-5 million respectively, totalling  212-5 million, and to these figures is tobe added the cost of the unrequited Western Union expenditure, which will fall onthe Ministry of Supply Vote, which, in 1950-51 and 1951-52, may amount to 2-25 million and  1-5 million respectively.  The Committee has agreed, and theChiefs of Staff have endorsed this view, that efforts should be made to reduceMinistry of Supply Defence expenditure to no more than  185 million over thethree-year period.   Since the size of this part of the Ministry of supply expenditure is determined in the main by the requirements which have to be fulfilled on behalf of the Service Departments, reductions can only be made ifrequirements are cut. Urgent consultations are therefore taking place between theMinistry of Supply and the Service Departments to see whether, if risks are taken in research and development by the Ministry of Supply of the same order as those which are proposed in the case of the armed forces and the Admiraltyresearch and development programme, defence expenditure in the Minister ofSupply can be reduced to a total of  185 million over the next three years.   Onthis assumption the allocation of money to departments, together with theuniformed man-power strength, of the three Services over the next three years,would be as follows : (a) Money  (  million)Royal Navy     .........Army     .........R.A.F.............Western Union unrequited pro-duction (a) of air equipment...(b) In the Ministry of SupplyVote   ...Ministry of Supply and Ministryof Defence    .........Totals       .........379491949-50	1950-51	1951-52	1952-53	Totals(for comparison only) (189-25) (304-70) (207-45)	201 307 233	201 304 237	201 302 244	603 913 714-	7-5	4-5	0-5	12-5-	2-25	1-5	X	1-75+X(58-46)	60-25	61 0	62-5-X	183-75-X(759-86)	811-00	809-00	810-00	2,430-0

This applies particularly to the Stores Vote, where production difficulties are involved. Thetotal allocations which are proposed above are the minimum in some cases belowthe minimum necessary to provide for our defence needs over the three-year period. It is therefore of the utmost importance that departments should beauthorised to carry forward from year to year any money which they have not found it possible or desirable to spend. Only if this is allowed will the proposedannual allocations be properly and economically spent.4. It has been necessary, in order not to exceed the annual total of 810 million, to keep expenditure on equipment well below a level which would ensure our ability to expand production quickly in an emergency. This effect would be considerably diminished, without incurring additional expenditure,if an armament export trade were to be built up in peace-time on a considerable scale.5. The acceptance of the above allocations of money and men involves seriousrisks in regard to the adequacy of the Forces and in the field of research anddevelopment. Details of the proposed Forces during the next three years, ofthe commitments which they will be able to undertake and of the risks whichwill have to be accepted are given in a parallel report by the Chiefs of staff committee.6. It should be noted that the recent reduction in the exchange value of sterling against the dollar will result in considerable increases in service department expenditure. It is, however, impossible as yet to estimate whatthe effect will be on the figures in paragraph 3 (a) above. Our recommendationshave therefore had to be made without taking account of this development.7.   The Committee recommend : (i) that the provisional Defence Budget for the three years beginning-April 1950 shall be as set out in paragraph 3 (a) above.(ii) that within the total allocations to each Department adjustmentsbetween one year and another should be allowed.(iii) that sketch estimates for the financial year 1950-51 should be prepared on the basis of the money allocations in paragraph 3 (a) of this report and that planning for the years 1951-52 and 1952-53 should proceed in accordance with those figures.(iv) that the uniformed man-power figures jjiven in paragraph 3 (b) above should be accepted, and should form the basis of the investigationsof the proposed Working Party, under the Chairmanship ofSir Godfrey Ince, which is to consider the control of the NationalService intake.(Signed) M.

ANNEX C[C.O.S. (49) 313 (Final)]CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEETHE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE ARMED FORCES OVERTHE NEXT THREE YEARSReportWe have considered, as instructed by the Minister of Defence, the questionof the security of this country in relation to an annual allocation of funds for defence purposes amounting to an average of  810 million over the next threeyears. We have first considered the nature of the threat which we must be readyto meet.2. We have two enemies Communism and Russia. We are already at war with Soviet Communism, but not yet with Russia. If Communism wins the cold War which it is now waging, the Western powers will have been defeatedwithout Russia having to resort to force at all. If the Western powers win the cold War, Russia may start a shooting war in desperation or, quite possibly,find us so strong that she dare not attack. Our first political and strategic object,therefore, is to win the Cold War; our second is to make ourselves as strong aspossible to meet the possibility of a shooting war with Russia.The Cold war.   All three services must play their part in the Cold War by : (a) Holding our present possessions and influence against attacks, internalor external, which fall short of Major War.(b) Encouraging other nations to resist Communism.Offensive action in the Cold War is largely a political matter but its implement a-tion requires the backing of the Armed Services.4. In the Cold War, the major weight falls, of necessity, on the Army. Thegreater part of its fighting units are already deployed overseas to meet Cold Warcommitments. There is little prospect of these commitments being reduced thetendency is for them to increase and if they are to continue to be met, there canbe no reduction in the major units of the regular Army nor, unless regularrecruiting greatly improves, in the length of National Service. Unfortunately,the demands of the Cold War are, as far as the Army is concerned, largelyantagonistic to preparation for a Major War. The Army, on any possible Budget,cannot effectively bear the burden of the Cold War and at the same time preparefully for a Major War.  One must have preference; this should be the Cold War.5. Fortunately, neither in the Navy nor in the Royal Air Force is there, tothe same extent, this direct conflict between the needs of the Cold War and a major War. Where conflict does occur in these services, we consider that therequirements for a Major War should take precedence.6. For the Cold War, the highest scale of equipment is not so vitally necessary as for a Major War. It follows that the Army will incline more totrained man-power at the expense of equipment, while the other two services will have, to some extent, to sacrifice man-power to equipment.A Major War7. In war, our strategy has three main pillars the United Kingdom, out-sea communications and our position in the Middle East. The Defence services should therefore be organised in peace to cover the requirements of the Cold Warand, in co-operation with our allies in war, to secure these three pillars.37949 c 2
8. The Russians, besides subsidiary offensives elsewhere, are likely to directtheir main efforts to : (a) A land and air offensive into Western Europe.(6) An air attack on the United Kingdom.(c) An  extensive   mining  campaign  against  our   ports  and  harbourapproaches.(d) A combined submarine and air attack on our sea communications.(e) A land and air offensive in the Middle East.9. The odds against the Western Powers and the risk of defeat are greateston land and least at sea, but the risks of defeat to this country are most immediatein the air, less sudden on sea and longest delayed on land. If our air strengthwas inadequate we could lose the air war in a very short time and, having lostit, no other operation on sea or land in our defence could succeed. If we avoiddefeat in the air, but are unable to maintain our sea communications, we shouldbe denied vital supplies which could lead to our defeat in a few months.&quot; If,however, we avoid defeat in the air war and preserve our vital sea communications,the loss of Western Europe and the Middle East would not necessarily be decisive.These factors must be taken into acount when considering our preparations fora major war.Priorities10. On this basis, we can place our requirements functionally in the follow-ing order of urgency : (a) Success in the Cold War.(&amp;) The defence of the United Kingdom against air attack.(c) The security of sea communications vital to the United Kingdom, and ofthe approaches to our ports and harbours against mining attack.(d) The retention of the Middle East.(e) The provision of forces for Western Europe.(/) The general build-up for an ultimate offensive.Air Defence of Great Britain11. The major burden of the air defence of Great Britain falls on the R.A.F.and requires both defensive and offensive forces. While fighter aircraft, A.A.weapons and an adequate Control and Reporting System are absolutely essentialto enable a heavy toll to be taken of enemy aircraft attacking this country, wecannot rely for our security on local defence alone. An air striking force to takeoffensive action against the immediate sources of the enemy air threat is also necessary, and in any event is our only means of combating attacks by V2 weapons.Long-range air bombardment must be left to the Americans, at least until Britishlong-range bombers with adequate performance are available for this purpose,but in the meantime we must maintain a medium bomber force as a complement toFighter Command for the air defence of this country. Consequently, the strengthand equipment of the air forces required for the defence of this country, togetherwith A.A. Command of the Army, must be our first priority in preparation forwar.Security of Sea Communications12. This is almost entirely the responsibility of the Navy and the R.A.F.The forces required to combat the threat of the submarine, the mine and the aero-plane against sea communications should have equal preference. Full advantage should be taken of American Naval and Air assistance in dealing with thesubmarine and air attack on the high seas.Middle East-13. It appears at present that no American land forces will be available forthe defence of the Middle East in the early stages of a Major War. We shall,therefore, have to hold this area with our own resources aided by such formationsas the other members of the Commonwealth can make available. The smallestreinforcement that can have any effect in this theatre is two British divisions with supporting troops. These should be provided, but it is unlikely that they wouldbe &quot;sufficient to hold the Middle East without considerable further land reinforce-ments and Tactical Air Forces.
Western Europe14. A promise of British reinforcement for Western Europe, sooner or later,is probably a political necessity if Western Union is to develop effectively. Twddivisions should be held against this eventuality. If Western Union collapsedmilitarily before they were ready to embark, it would then be for consideration whether they should be sent to the Middle East.Allocation of Funds15. Against this background we have considered what naval, land and airforces will be required to perform the tasks allotted to the three services, and how the suggested sum of money should be sub-allotted. This difficult and com-plicated problem has been studied by a working party set up by the Ministry ofDefence and we have had the benefit of their advice in reaching our conclusions.16. We have only been able to make reasonable proposals for the security ofthis Country, within the financial limit now suggested, on the assumption that: (a) There will be a period of warning before war breaks out which will enableour re-armament programme to be greatly accelerated.(b) Our plans are fully integrated with those of our Allies, notably theUnited States.(c) Provision will be made for the carry over of any unexpended balance inone year to the following year.(d) Our production potential will be maintained by some means outside theService Estimates, e.g., by placing orders now for aircraft and armyequipment for ready sale to other members of the Commonwealth andto certain Foreign countries.17.   On this basis we recommend the following sub-allocation of funds :   Million1951-52   1952-53   Average201 201 20.1304 302 304^237 244 23862i 621 621809 810 8101950-51Admiralty          ......      ... 201War   Office       ......... 307Air Ministry      ...      ...... 233Unrequited, expenditure on western     Union    airequipment       ...      ... 7 Balance (Ministry of Supply and ministry of Defence         ... 62J. Total    ......... 811Effect of these Proposals18. This allocation of money will enable the Services to maintain the forces and to carry out the tasks shown in the Appendices* to this paper.19. The broad effect on the priority requirements enumerated in para-graph 10 above would be as follows during the three years in question: (a) Cold War. We can provide forces throughout the world needed to resistRussia&apos;s Cold War Tactics on their present scale but these forces would be insufficient if the tempo of the Cold War should increase.(b) Air Defence. We can make some continuous provision for the defenceof the United Kingdom against air attack but a considerable warningperiod would be necessary to enable the requisite air forces to be built up to the strength they must attain by the outbreak of war.There will be no war reserve of fighter or bomber aircraft and, without this period of warning needed to build up such a reserve, our air defence forces could not survive more than about a month of intensivefighting.(c) Sea Communications. Allowing for 50 per cent, participation by theUnited States in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, and for sup-port by the Commonwealth countries and our other Allies, we can provide the bare minimum of naval forces needed to maintain control* Appendices I-III.
of our sea communications in the face of the estimated Soviet threat.The speed at which the Fleet can be mobilised will be slow and ourMaritime air forces would be able to give only limited air cover tothe sea approaches of the United Kingdom.(d) Middle East. The land forces available foi the defence of the middle east will be dangerously inadequate. We are relying on United Statesparticipation in the Air Defence of this theatre and of our line ofcommunication through the Mediterranean. Our ability to defendEgypt will depend partly on the extent to which Anglo-United states air attack on the vulnerable Russian lines of communication delaysthe advance of their land forces and partly on the rate at whichreinforcements can reach this theatre.(e) Western Europe. Present Government Policy is to accept no commitment to send land reinforcement to Western Europe on outbreak of war.Moreover no such forces will be available during the next few years in time to take part in the initial battle, beyond a small increase inTactical Air Forces and in supporting units for B.A.O.R. As notedabove, however, two divisions can be earmarked for possible despatch to Western Europe on decisions made nearer the time.General20. No provision can be made at present for the reserves that would benecessary in war to keep our forces in action during the period in which our industry is switching to a war basis. This lack of reserves will very seriouslycurtail the period for which our forces could fight with what they have got inthe event of a sudden emergency. This is an inescapable risk under an annualdefence budget not exceeding  810 million. Readiness for war in the long termwill depend on increased budgets in future years.Conclusion21. Any substantial reduction in the suggested annual allocation of 810 million can only result in unacceptable defence risks, or in our inability tomeet some of our present commitments with the political consequences that thiswould entail.  There are no appreciable savings to be made by marginal economies.22.   We are unanimously agreed that *(a) The plan evolved is the best that can be made on the basis of the financialrestrictions imposed, and represents a great advance on the proposals contained in the Harwood Report.(b) The sum of  810 million a year for the next three years is, in our opinion,not sufficient to ensure the security of this country either againstsurprise attack or if American aid were to be delayed or limited.(c) The risks run under this plan, particularly in the quantity rather thanthe quality of the R.A.F., are considerable and they are only acceptablebecause of the reliance placed on the assistance we expect to receive from American forces and in the expectation that the strategic air offensive to be undertaken by the Americans will reduce to some extent the full force of the Russian offensive.(d) The plan cannot be implemented on any less sum.(e) Provision must be made for the carry over of any unexpended balance in one year to the following year.(/) Readiness for war in the long term will depend on increased budgets infuture years.(Signed) TEDDER.FRASER.W.

APPENDIX I-NAVYStrength of the Royal Navy on Annual Navy Estimates of  201 million for 1950-51 to 1952-53Man-power \ ,It is intended to reduce the man-power bearing (Vote A) to 124,000 by 1953,the run-down to this figure being as follows :  1st April, 1950        ............... 141,1001st April, 1951        ............      ... 128,3001st April, 1952        ................ 124,8001st April, 1953 ...      ......... 124,0002. These numbers will enable approximately the same number of ships asat present to remain in commission, permit the necessary sea training to be carriedout, and provide the nucleus on which to expand in the event of war. . .3. The National Service intake into the Royal Navy is being reduced to2,000 a year from 1st October, 1949. It will remain at this level for about twoyears, after which it will cease altogether, except for a small number of men tobe trained as pilots and observers. The problem of providing the required numberof Naval Reserves when the National Service entry ceases is being examined bythe Admiralty and a scheme is under consideration for the creation of a NationalService Reserve into which men would be entered direct without any period of full-time service.Peace-time Fleet4. On  201 million it will be possible to maintain the same Fleet in commission as at present for the next three years. When the backlog of shoretraining has been Overtaken, it may be possible to make some increase in the small ships in commission.5. The Navy will therefore maintain the same support to pur Foreign and colonial Policy as now, continue to play its present part in the cold war and carry out training as a preparation for war.6. The peace-time disposition of the Fleet at the present time is givenin Table I.Wartime Fleet7. In the following table is set out the strength of the Fleet in 1950, givingships in commission and in reserve. In the column headed 1957 is given theminimum war Fleet that the Admiralty consider essential for the control of sea communications, it is based on the United States Navy providing half the naval forces required in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean/Middle East area,which is the most they can promise : TypeBattleshipsFleet CarriersLight Fleet CarriersAircraft Repair ShipsCruisers        ...Fast MinelayersDestroyersFrigatesSubmarinesOcean MinesweepersCoastal or Inshore M/SMine-location Craft ...Front-Line Aircraft ...	1950		1957In	In		nmission	Reserve	Total	1	4*	1 + 4*	1 + 4*3	3	6	5 + lt4	2	6	41	0	1	115	12	27	180	3	3	339	15	54	6260	165	225	18233	30	63	5315	46	61	6110	72	82	2500	0	0	36150		150	250* Not to be modernised until guided weapons are in supply,f Modernised for deck landing training only.
8. Comparing the strength of the Fleet in 1950 with that required for warin 1957, it will be seen that in some types there is a shortage of ships while in others there is an excess; the latter the Admiralty proposes to dispose of. Tomake good the shortages new construction is required and the proposed programme for the next three years is given in paragraph 11. It will, however, be necessaryto increase greatly the building programme after 1952-53 if the shortages areto be made good and over-age ships replaced by 1957.9. Although the numerical strength of the war-time Fleet for the next three years is not below the Admiralty&apos;s minimum figure, except for shortagesreferred to above, an average sum of  201 million during this period has aserious effect in later years, as many of our ships are obsolescent and theirre-equipment will be deferred. Also the speed at which the Fleet can be mobilisedwill be slow owing to lack of stockpile of stores and equipment for mobilisation.10. After 1957 the rate at which ships become obsolete is such that therewill be a steady decline of numerical strength of the Navy from then onwards.This remains true even if the rate of new construction from 1952-53 onwards,referred to in paragraph 8 above, were continued.New Construction11. Below is set out the new construction which the Admiralty proposes toput in hand during the next three years; two Fleet Carriers, four Light FleetCarriers and eight Destroyers, at present under construction, are not shown inthe table.New Construction1950-51 1951-52   1952-53 Totalsubmarines     ......... 0 2 0            2Coastal Minesweepers         ... 5 11 g 9fInshore Minesweepers 5 8 8 oiMine Location Craft ... 6 0 8 ilCoastal Forces MTB/MGB  ... 1 4 4            oSeaward Defence A/S Craft ... 2 0 4           612. The above new construction programme is larger than that proposed inthe Harwood Report but smaller than that which the Admiralty hold to be theminimum necessary; it does, however, make some provision for minesweepers aswell as replacing wornout ships.Modernisation and Conversion of Ships13. As many of our ships are rapidly becoming obsolescent, particularly inregard to the weapons used against modern forms of attack, it is necessary tore-equip and modernise them if they are to carry out their tasks; the conversionof a number of our older Fleet Destroyers to fast A/S frigate is required in orderto control the fast submarine.14. The Admiralty propose to put in hand the following modernisation andconversions during the next three years : Modernisation of Fleet Carriers          ...      ...      ... 1Modernisation of Cruisers         ...      ...      ...      ... 1Modernisation of Destroyers      ...      ...       ...      ... 12Modernisation of Frigates         ....      ...      ...      ... 9Convert old Fleet Destroyers to A/S Frigates ...       ... 10Convert &quot; T &quot; Class Submarines to fast battery drive ... 215. The rate of conversion and modernisation is much slower than that whichthe Admiralty hold to be the minimum necessary; the above programme does makea start in re-equipping the Fleet to meet submarine and air attack, but it onlymodernises about one-eighth of the force.Naval Aviation16. A front-line strength of 250 aircraft is considered to be the minimum which will enable Naval Aviation to carry out its prescribed roles in wartime. Itwas planned to reach this strength through gradual expansion by 1957.
17. The reduction of the Naval Vote to  201 million will, however, entailholding the front line at its existing level of 150 aircraft during the next threeyears with a reduced reserve backing.18. During the next three years it is planned that a few squadrons of more modern aircraft will replace some of the existing types now in service; this canbe provided for to a limited extent within the  201 million estimates.War Reserves of Stores19. The Admiralty have planned to allocate some  6-2 million for stock-piling of war reserves of stores for the next three years; this figure has been cut bya third. Should war break out before stocks are built up, many essential stores forfighting and seagoing efficiency would run out after the first few months, andit would only be possible to provide uniforms for a proportion of men called upfor service.A administrative Economies20. The Admiralty have already proposed the most drastic economies in administrative and shore establishments. It is the intention to press on firmlywith these measures, but it is clear that, due to the variety of the interests involved,there will be difficulty in achieving the financial savings planned as early asexpected.Table IStationHomeMediterraneanEast IndiesThe Present Peacetime FleetClass of Ship...

The size of the Army allowed by the available money would just enablesufficient strength to be maintained to meet our estimated commitments providedthat the tempo of the Cold War does not increase. In assessing the size of the garrisons throughout the world, certain assumptions have had to be made as tothe possibility of reducing or even withdrawing various garrisons. Suchassumptions have been based on as realistic an estimate as possible of the world situation over the three-year period. The garrisons which we would be able tomaintain based on these assumptions and with the available money and man-power are as follows : 1st January, 1st April,     1st April,    1st April,1950 1951 1952 1953&apos;   Germany Armoured Division ...      ...      1Infantry Division   ...      ...      1.

For ease of presentation only those independent major units in theUnited Kingdom have been fully listed.)Other Garrisons The minimum possible garrisons would be retained in Gibraltar, Bermuda,and West Indies.Ill1 1 111111 11111 1 112-3 2-31                1 1111               2 12               2 224              24 2426              28 24111
2. The overheads for this active Army would be a bare minimum to providefor the training and administration of the active formations. The units in theUnited Kingdom would be sufficient to give a measure of assistance to theTerritorial Army, though this assistance is necessarily less than was originallyhoped for, owing to the strength of these units having to be reduced. some measure of balance would still be maintained and the disbandment of majorunits would be avoided, so that expansion in case of war would not be prejudicedon this score.Manpower Requirement3. The manpower requirement (men only) of the above forces wouldgradually fall, mainly owing to administrative economies, as follows : 1 April, 1950       1 April, 1951       1 April, 1952       1 April, 1953364,400 339,500 335,750 332,750Size of the Territorial Army4.   The Territorial Army would consist of : (a) Anti-Aircraft 155 A.A. Regiments (T.A.)These would have their R.A. units at only 40 of their existing estab-lishment by 1954, the balance having to be made up on mobilisation, or perhaps during a crisis period preceding general mobilisation.(b) Field Force-1 Armoured Division3 Infantry Divisions2 Independent Armoured Brigades.(c) Home Defence (including the provision of Mobile Columns to assist inCivil Defence) 5 DivisionsEven by 1954 it is unlikely to be possible to fill these divisions to fullestablishment in peacetime.id) Administrative Units These would provide the administrative backing for both the active and Territorial Armies in war.Equipment5.   General(a) The money allotted for new equipment would enable the Army tomaintain existing production of such essential items as tanks,ammunition and modern radar. It should also permit startingproduction of a number of new items when these reach the appro-priate stage of development, though the extent to which this will bepossible is likely to be severely restricted, since the money alloca-tion does not increase year by year. The Army therefore regardsthe ability to carry forward any shortfall in a year&apos;s production programme to the next, thus treating the whole period as a financial entity, as a vitally important feature of the equipmentplanA.A. Command(b) By April of 1953 A.A. Command would have sufficient modern equip-ment for training purposes, and would be capable of mobilising allRegular and Territorial Army regiments with adequate gunspares and test equipment. Modern fire control and tacticalcontrol radar would be about 75 per cent, of requirements. AHthe guns mobilised would be of last war types, though abouta quarter would have been fully modernised, including asmall proportion in the shape of the 3-7-inch Littlejohn gunrecommended by the Air Defence Committee. With few excep-tions, stocks of Heavy Anti-Aircraft ammunition would be well37949 d 2
below the target figure of 3,000 r.p.g., and there would be largedeficiencies in general stores, including uniform. All the vehiclesrequired for mobilisation would have to be impressed, with theexception of those necessary for initial deployment.Active Army(c) By April of 1953 the Active Army would be equipped to war scales,with the exception of certain administrative stores. Armouredregiments would be re-equipped with Centurion Ills, but otherwise, most of the equipment would be of last wartypes. This would also apply to wheeled vehicles, which Wouldbe mainly rebuilt types, with serious deficiencies especially inspecialist categories. Great reliance would have to be placed onthe impressment of civilian type vehicles for an emergency.Territorial A rmy(d) By April of 1953 the Field Force of our divisions (including one armoured) and two armoured brigades would be equipped to warscales including tanks, but excluding certain administrative stores,and wheeled vehicles would be on very reduced scales. Equip-ment would be of last war types. The five remaining TerritorialArmy divisions would be equipped at training scales only, but would be capable of assisting in civil defence or against airbornelandings.War Reserves6. (a) The quantity of stores and vehicles produced would not fully cover the Army&apos;s mobilisation requirements, still less would it makeany provision for the reserves that would be necessary in the early months of war to keep our forces in the field while indusrty was expanding. Any start in the provision of these reserves would necessitate a much larger financial allotment.(b) The effects of this lack of reserves would become less serious in proportion to the development of a healthy armament exportindustry, a course which is strongly advocated.Works7. The original plan was to complete the modernisation of barracks inten years and the provision of married quarters at home in four years. On theassumption that a loan is obtained sufficient to finance the building of at least two-thirds of the married quarters at home it is hoped still to complete that part of the programme in four years; but it will now be necessary to spread the modernisation programme over sixteen years.Increase in Pay8. The financial allotment would allow for no increase in the general ratesof pay nor for any marked improvement in the general conditions within theArmy. The crying need of the Army at the present is an increase in the numberof Regulars. Without the necessary inducements, the Officers and men will notbe forthcoming.Provision of land forcesJor the defence of the Middle East and Western europe on the outbreak of war9. Should war break out in the next three years it is probable that, inview of its world-wide deployment on Cold War commitments, no considerableportion of the Regular Army would be available to reinforce either the middle east or Western Europe. It is, however, possible that the situation in HongKong would be such as to permit the removal from the Far East of up to one infantry Division for service in one of these theatres.The Regular Army is indeed so small that even if the intensity of the boldWar were to diminish considerably little more could be made available m the shape of an Expeditionary Force.We are forced therefore to rely mainly on the four high priority divisions of the Territorial Army. By its very nature the Territorial Army requires a precautionary period in which to get ready.  We are doing our best to speed up
their rate of mobilisation, but owing to lack of equipment and of training itis doubtful whether any of these formations could be made available for the reinforcement of Western Europe in time to be of use. It also remains doubtfulwhether they could be got to the Middle East in time to save the situation unlessconsiderable United States reinforcements were made available soon after theoutbreak of war.By the 1957 period these Territorial formations should have improved bothin equipment and training, though the improvement will be slight unless the cold War materially slackens or the Army budget is increased. No increase inthe total number of formations available is foreseen, so that, in view of probableincreased Russian preparedness, provision of land forces will still be dangerodslyinadequate for the role which we shall be expected to play.APPENDIX III-R.A.F.Service Estimates 1950-53The provision of  233 million,  237 million and  244 million over the next three years would enable the R.A.F. to carry out the expansion of Fighter andBomber Commands already announced in Parliament, to continue the replace-ment of obsolescent aircraft in Fighter Command and to start it in bomber command, and to maintain the front-line of other Commands at their present level, except that the transport force in the United Kingdom would have to bereduced by two-thirds. The R.A.F. (except Transport Command) could continueto play its present part in the Cold War; and our visible show of strength wouldbe considerably increased.2. We should not, however, be able to make any provision for the reserves which would be required to keep the force in operation if war broke out. TheAir Force would be a shop-window Air Force, and in the event of war it could notsurvive more than about a month of intensive fighting.3. The effect on the main components of the R.A.F. of the proposedallocations is described below. The enclosures show the front line during theperiod in question.Bomber Command4. The front-line medium bomber strength of Bomber Command could be expanded from 176 to 280 aircraft. Its main equipment throughout the period would continue to be the Lincoln, except that B.29 aircraft sufficient for a fewsquadrons may be obtained under the United States Military Aid programme and the twin-jet Canberra should start coming into service in 1952.5. Bomber Command would be able, by attacking enemy communications,airfields, troop concentrations, &amp;c, to make a small but essential contributionto the battle for air supremacy which must be won if we are to have any chanceeither of reducing the scale of air attack on this country to bearable proportionsor of holding the enemy in Europe. It could also help in a small measure toprotect our sea communications by attacking coastal targets and by laying mines,and it would be capable of limited reinforcement of the Middle East in emergency.It would also be a nucleus on which an air striking force capable of mountingeffective attacks against the heart of Russia could be developed when modernhigh performance bombers become available.Fighter Command6. The day fighter force is now equipped with Meteors and Vampires,which are as good as any fighters in the world. As announced in Parliament,this force is due to be doubled before the end of 1950.7. It is also planned to increase the night fighter force from 48 aircraft to 120. It is at present equipped with Mosquito aircraft. Apart from theirnumerical inadequacy, the Mosquito night fighters should be good enough to dealwith the majority of the types of bomber which the Russians now have in service,though they would be ineffective above 25,000 ft. against the B.29 type aircraft,of which the Russians already have a limited number. It is hoped that a jetnight fighter will come into service in 1952.
8. Fighter Command includes 32 long-range fighters for intruder and anti-shipping operations. These squadrons are equipped with the Hornet, and it is planned to increase their number to 64 during the period.9. The control and reporting system in the Main Defended Area, which covers only the South-Eastern corner of England, could continue to be strengthenedto some extent; and the system could be extended by 1952 to cover also the north of England, including the Liverpool and Clydeside areas. Air defence of theSouth-West, North-East and North-West Approaches to the country would be virtually non-existent.Coastal Command10. The small Maritime Air Forces would continue to keep alive the tech-nique of anti-submarine operations and of defending our shipping against attacksat sea, and to undertake photographic and meteorological reconnaissance. Intime of war they would be able to give only limited air cover to the sea approachesof the United Kingdom.Transport Command11. Transport Command would have to be abolished as a separate Command,and the transport force in the United Kingdom would have to be reduced from120 to 40 aircraft, of which 8 would be allotted to keeping alive the technique ofairborne support operations. The force would be able to transport small loadsof troops and equipment to overseas theatres if reinforcement at short noticebecame necessary, and it could carry out occasional exercises in air mobility.B.A.F.O. (Germany) and Western Union Tactical Air Force12. B.A.F.O. would continue to support B.A.O.R. in its occupational duties and, as our only existing Tactical Air Force, to keep alive the technique of Army Support. This very small, force has had to be depleted by two squadrons inorder to reinforce Hong Kong and it is not known when they can be replaced.Middle East Air Forces13. Middle East Air Forces would be maintained at about their presentsize, and their re-equipment with modern types should be completed. the command would be able to make some slight show of force against an attack onthe Middle East, though it would be quite inadequate to overcome an attack inany strength.Far East A ir Forces14. Far East Air Forces could continue to provide limited forces for suchair operations as the continuance of the anti-bandit campaign in Malaya or for thedefence of Hong Kong should that Colony be attacked.Economies in Overheads15. Substantial economies are being made in the training organisation, anumber of development units and similar establishments are being abolished or reduced and overheads are being reduced in a variety of other ways. The largereductions in requirements of man-power which result from these measures will,with the help of the cut in Transport Command, counter-balance the demands ofthe expansion of Bomber and Fighter Command and the extension of the Controland Reporting System, and thus allow the total man-power of the force to remainroughly constant.
