THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1949SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 21524th October, 194931CABINETLORD HENDERSON&apos;S VISIT TO GERMANYNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report made to me byLord Henderson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, onhis recent visit to Germany.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,   ; ;24th October, 1949.Note by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Lord Henderson) on his Visit to Germany, 13th-20th September, 1949I spent the period 13th-20th September in Germany, visiting the Ruhr, Bonnand Frankfurt. I held discussions with a number of leading Germans, includingthe Federal Chancellor, the Federal President, Dr. Schumacher, the Minister-President and other Ministers of the Land Government of North Rhine-West-phalia, and representatives of the Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Organisations.I was also able to have discussions with the British and American high commissioners and a short talk with the French High Commissioner.A.-The Trade Unions and the Employers&apos; OrganisationsUnfortunately Dr. Boeckler, the outstanding personality in the german trade Unions, was away from the Ruhr at the time of my visit as he was con-ducting negotiations at Munich for the fusion of the Unions of the western zones into a single Federation. One of the questions I had intended discussing with him was the question of Joint Consultation between employers and the TradeUnions-we have for some time been endeavouring to promote, discussions, butprogress has been slow. I saw his two deputies, Herr vom Hoff and Herr Foecher,who in response to my enquiry told me that talks on Joint Consultation weresoon to be started with representatives of the Employers&apos; Associations. Thiswas confirmed later when I met Herr Lobeck, the Secretary of the Employers&apos;Association for the British Zone, who had visited this country to study our systemof industrial relations, and Herr Bielstein, the Chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia Employers&apos; Association. They assured me that their attitude in thismatter was a sympathetic one. I have arranged to be kept informed of developments.I also saw Herr August Schmidt, the Chairman of the Mineworkers&apos; union in the British Zone. He informed me that a meeting of the Trizonal executive of the Union earlier this morning had approved the decision which had been37746
taken by the Zonal Executive to co-operate with the committees set up by theOccupation Authorities in the reorganisation of the coal-mining industry. this statement on the part of Herr Schmidt was particularly important in view of. the reserve with which our plans had been greeted by Dr. Boeckler, who felt thatthe committees set up did not provide adequately for Trade Union representation.Herr Schmidt said that he expected German coal production to reach the levelof 350,000 tons per day by November.B. Dr. SchumacherThe longest talk I had during my visit was with the leader of the SocialDemocrat Party, Dr. Schumacher. In spite of the strains of the election period,which had only just ended, he struck me as being in better health than when last saw him. Whatever truth there may be in the suggestion that his holdin the Party was weakened as a result of his leadership both during and immediately after-the General Election, it seemed to me that his position issecure. Whatever his temperamental defects, there is no one who denies hisoutstanding intellectual capacity.Before we discussed dismantling, Dr. Schumacher referred to the role ofthe Social Democrat Party (SPD) in the new Federal Parliament. This, hesaid, would be an Opposition without qualification. The SPD intended to force the Federal Government to put through the kind of social policy the SPDwanted.When the conversation turned to dismantling, Dr. Schumacher left muchof the discussion to his three colleagues, Prof. Noelting, Minister of Economics inthe Government of North Rhine-Westphalia, Herr Henssler, Chairman of theParty Executive in North Rhine-Westphalia, and Prof. Baade, the Party experton dismantling.The latter was the chief spokesman, and based his case on the SPD memo-randum addressed to the British Labour Party. Economic, employment, politicaland psychological arguments against dismantling were advanced, and ProfessorBaade added that, as a result of dismantling, at no time since the beginning of theOccupation had such tension eXi&amp;ted between the British and the Germans.Dt. Schumacher referred to the support the SPD were receiving in their fightfrom democratic organisations in Great Britain, the United States and France,and stated that they proposed to carry on with their campaign.In my reply I laid stress on the fact that we were administering a tripartiteand not merely a British policy; that its motive was a desire for security and notto injure the proper competitive ability of Germany; that the dismantling pro-gramme had recently been substantially reduced; and that in concentrating on dis-mantling, which was a diminishing factor, the SPD were in danger of under-estimating the constructive developments in Germany which we had helped tobring about and which were expanding and increasing in importance. I said thatwe recognised their democratic rights and that if they carried on a campaign on constitutional lines against dismantling we could not Object. Dr. Schumacherwas obviously disappointed that I gave no indication of Allied intention eitherto stop or to modify their present dismantling policy. I ended the talk on a more acceptable note by expressing my pleasure at a press statement issued by the SPDa few days earlier which paid tribute to the British as an Occupying Power.I formed the impression that Dr. Schumacher intended to make dismantlingthe first major issue in the Federal Parliament, and that he would press theGovernment to raise the matter with the High Commission at an early date. Heseemed confident of rallying the support of political, trade union, parliamentary,press and Church forces abroad in his campaign.C-- The Federal PresidentIn the course of my talk with the Federal President, who had asked me for my impressions, I said that, during my first visit fifteen months ago, I had given special attention to the question of housing, which, in my view, formed with tnerelated refugee problem the most Urgent social issue in Germany. During m)present Visit I had been disappointed at the lack of evidence of a real drivesonew housing for the people.   I had noticed a good deal of activity in connecuoi
with the rebuilding of churches, town halls and luxury buildings and on the repairsof damaged houses, and I had noted with satisfaction that a considerable amountof tidying up in war-damaged centres had been done. But of new housing I had seen little evidence, though I admitted that this was not proof that new housingconstruction was not being carried on. I said that in Great Britain all thepolitical parties had put forward in their election programmes in 1945 plans for a housing drive, and that under the present Government, apart from the repair of a vast number of damaged dwellings, 1 million Units of new housing accommb-dation had been completed by the end of July this year.The President described what had been done in Western Germany and saidthat the great obstacle was the lack of credit resources. This point was stressedby others. But there is no doubt that both labour and materials are available fora housing drive. On the other hand, building costs have risen steeply, and asrents, even of new houses, are restricted to the pre-war equivalent, private invest-ment is not attracted, as it is not an economic proposition to build houses to rent.Later, in conversation with Frau TeUsch, Minister of Education in North Rhine-Westphalia, I was told that DM.306 million had been allocated out of. the Landbudget for housing, and that a similar allocation was being asked for out of theFederal budget. These together would coVer the provision of about 60,000 new housing units at present building costs. My comment was that it would take manyyears at this rate to break the back of the housing problem.I understand that the SPD had made housing one of the principal items oftheir election programme, but, despite present deplorable housing conditions, itdoes not appear to have exerted an appeal comparable with that in the british general Election of 1945.This confirmed the impression which I had already formed that the germans are not only la very industrious (they are making tremendous productive effortsas the steel and coal figures show) but also a very enduring people. It wouldseem that they are willing to tolerate social conditions which would produceacute political unrest in this country which no party could afford to ignore. Itis, however, only fair to add that housing in Germany is a Land responsibility and that it is only with the creation of a Federal Parliament that it can nowbe properly viewed on a national scale. But I could not refrain in my conversa-tions with some of the German leaders from expressing the view that, if therehad been as much public concern and agitation directed to this question of housing,which is in their hands, as was being devoted to dismantling, more progressmight have been made.The refugee problem is a particularly formidable burden and unless properlyhandled might become a serious political&quot; danger. It is in my opinion not only aGerman but a European problem.D. The Federal ChancellorApart from my conversation with Dr. Schumacher, I consider my talk withthe Federal Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, to have been one of the most important aspects of my visit. I spent about an hour with Dr. Adenauer in his new office in Bonn, and a further hour with him at an official luncheon party at which bothHerr Arnold, President of the Bundesrat, and Dr. Koehler, President of the bundestag, were also present.I have always considered Dr. Adenauer a wily customer (I still so regardhim) and have had little reason hitherto to think him favourably disposed towards us. I would not go so far as to say that assumption of office has made a changedman of Dr. Adenauer, but it has certainly given him greater confidence and hassuperficially at any rate broken down some of his impassive reserve, which inthe past has given him a suspicious and faintly hostile bearing. His interview with myself was his first official engagement with any ministerial representativeol a foreign Government, and I do not think his evident satisfaction at this event was mere politeness! He was in addition extremely anxious to eradicateany impression that he was anti-British and referred with pleasure to your state-ment made to him privately at Ostenwalde that the war was now over and thatthe British and Germans must: work together. His touchiness about the recent?u6 n British press regarding election speeches (which was shared by manyotner Germans I spoke to) appears to me as further evidence of a new-foundanxiety to earn the good opinion of the Western world. Dr. Adenauer accompanied37746 B 2
complaints about the British press with the declared intention of dealing ruthlesslywith Right-wing extremism. He begged us not to increase the notoriety of the&apos;&apos; wild men &apos;&apos; of the Right wing by giving them excessive publicity in our press and asked me several times to assure him that the British Government would beready to grant the Federal Government confidence in advance. He was gratifiedto receive the Prime Minister&apos;s message which I delivered orally at his luncheon,and he took the opportunity to say that he regarded it as evidence of the willing-ness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to accord a measure of confidence in andvance for which he was asking. The fact that Dr. Koehler twice spoke to me aboutthe message before I left for my nexfengagement is an indication of the eagernesswith which they are looking for favourable signs.I was careful not to give the impression that we were ready to make a cleansheet of Germany&apos;s past actions, but said that a sincere hope existed, though with some reservations, that the new Federal Government would make an advance in Germany&apos;s progress towards stable and genuine democracy. The very factthat we had played a leading part in giving practical form to the conception ofa Federal Parliament and Government in Germany was a reflection of the con-fidence which the British people were ready to grant to the new Republic, providedthat Germany by her actions gave cause for confidence. Dr. Adenauer showed that he appreciated this point by aptly quoting : &quot; Ye shall know them by theirfruits.&apos;&apos; In reply to Adenauer&apos;s hope that we would not meet the new Governmentwith clenched fists I said it was our firm hope and desire to see both the militaristand political conceptions of the clenched fist eliminated altogether fromEuropean life.Dr. Adenauer then asked me for my views about Germany&apos;s entry into theCouncil of Europe. He thought that her inability to be represented in the Councilof Ministers should not be an obstacle to participation in the Assembly. Ideliberately refrained from giving Dr. Adenauer a direct answer on this point and told him that many things which were desirable could not always be achievedto one&apos;s own time-table. I, for example, had in July 1948 expressed to him andother German leaders the hope that the Federal Government would become areality in six months, but the preparations had taken twice as long as this; yet the delay had not detracted from the ultimate value of the achievement.Dr. Adenauer took this point and said he knew how to be patient.Indeed, I believe that patience and &quot; a healthy mistrust of everyone &quot; (to quote his own words) are the chief characteristics of the Federal Chancellor.But while he will be patient and prudent, he will also be resolute. In Federal, as opposed to party, office I believe his aims will be to further German interests asmuch as he can by establishing good relations with Western Europe and the americans. It would, however, be totally at variance with his political past and present convictions for him to attempt fco promote Soviet-German friendship.Communism is repugnant to his strong Catholic faith.On the whole Dr. Adenauer impressed me as a shrewd and subtle man withnothing of the demagogue about him. He is, in political experience and intellectualself-confidence, certainly head and shoulders above his colleagues, and for thisreason his manner towards them is somewhat patronising and autocratic, andhe clearly intends to keep the reins of government firmly in his own hands. Itis too early to judge yet whether the skill he has shown in holding his teamtogether and in forming a coalition will also characterise the execution of hisGovernment^ policy. He complained to me in confidence that when forminghis Ministry he had been shocked by &quot; the complete lack of restraint&quot; displayedby some of the aspirants.The only member of Dr. Adenauer&apos;s Government whom I met during my visit was the Minister of the Interior, Herr Heinemann, the Mayor of Essen. Atthe time I saw him, it was still a secret that he was destined for this post and hesaid nothing of it to me. He was the only German member of the ChristianDemocratic Union (CDU) with whom I discussed dismantling and I was impressed by his apparent ability to appreciate the Allied point of view, though I doubt itit modified his own attitude on this issue. He has done very efficient work asMayor of Essen and, though a deeply religious man, is not, like the majority of the  CDU, a Catholic. ,,Dr. Adenauer lacks the warm social feeling which distinguishes Herr Arnom,and he may need all his adroitness to keep the Left wing of the CDU from becoming too restive.   Herr Arnold told me that the Left-wing trade union
element of the CDU is confident that with the co-operation of the SPD they will beable to exert sufficient pressure on the Chancellor to carry through the main points of their social programme. There are, however, other parties further to the Rightthan the CDU in the Bundestag who will certainly oppose this, and while thereare compelling reasons why the SPD and the Left-wing CDU should seek to force the pace on social problems, I am not certain that in the light of the forcescomprising the Bundestag they may not be over-estimating their strength.When one considers the magnitude of the problems facing the new Govern-ment and, with one or two exceptions, the second-rate character of the men whowill have to tackle them, it seems to me that the SPD will enjoy a great advan-tage in not being in the Government. If they play their cards well and act as a constructive Opposition they will escape the odium inseparable from officialresponsibility in the present difficult state of Germany and will gain credit forpressing the Government to adopt a positive progressive policy; thereby winningincreasing recognition as the only possible alternative to a Right-wing Govern-ment. If, however, they were to pursue a policy of opposition for opposition^sake they would risk playing into the hands of both the Communists and extremenationalist elements who are notoriously hostile to parliamentary democracy. the bundestag does not possess the parliamentary traditions which are a vital element in the successful working of the British House of Commons, and the art of corn-promise and conciliation finds little scope in German political life. What is of supreme importance to the achievement of stable democracy in Germany is thatthe Federal Parliamentary institutions should win the confidence of the people and not fall into disrepute by frustration from within. I found an anxiety thatthe new Parliament should be enabled to work effectively on the lines of theBritish model, because it is recognised that the way in which it operates and theresults which it achieves will be used both within Germany and abroad as a yard-stick to measure the present strength and future prospects of the new democratic republic.H.26th September, 1949.
