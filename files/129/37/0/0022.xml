(49) 219? mycolleagues may find it useful to have the attached tablesshowing -(1)    the scales of pay of prison officers in 1939 and subsequent increases;    the Prison Officers&apos;Associations claim;    and the recommendedincreases;(2)   the cost of the Prison. Officers&apos; Association&apos;^claim and of the recommended increases;    and(3)    monthly recruitment to the police forces for theperiod April/September, 1949*2. The figures for recruitment to the police give some indication of the effect of the recent increase in policepay.      The increase was announced on the 26th May, 1949*Since, however, there is normally an interval, of at leastfour weeks between the date when a man applies to join thepolice and his enrolment, the effect of the increase in paycould not be reflected in any figures earlier than those for july.      The table therefore shows figures for three months before the increases in pay could take effect and for threemonths after.      The figures for October are not yet availablebut there are indications that, so far as the provinces areconcerned, the improvement in recruiting will be maintained.Judging by the requests for vacancies for recruits at trainincentres, the November figures will also be high.J. 0. iii*ome Office, S. &apos;.7. 1.2ND NOVEMBER,   1949.
