(1+9)  2kO28TH NOVEMBER.  1949CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMS:  1950 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 16th May (C. M. (1+9) 35thConclusions, Minute 1) the Cabinet considered a provisionallegislative programme for the 1950 Session (CP. (49) 104) whichhad been.drawn up by the Future Legislation Committee.     TheCabinet agreed that the drafting of the Bills included in this programme should proceed, provided that policy had been approved,and they invited the Future Legislation Committee to review fromtime to time the progress made with their preparation.2. The Committee have since carried out a review of theprovisional programme in consultation with the Ministers con-cerned, and they now submit for consideration by the Cabinetthe programme set out in Groups I to VI of Annex A to thismemorandum.3* In view of the present uncertainty regarding thelength of the 1950 Session, and of the fact that even if the session ran its full length the time available for legislation would probably not exceed 30 days, the Committee decided thatthe only possible course would he to submit a list of bills which seemed to them appropriate for introduction in thatSession.      They felt that if this was approved by the cabinet it could afterwards be left to the Legislation Committee, as thenew Session proceeded, to take such steps as seemed to themexpedient in the light of events to regulate the flow of new legislation.4. When drawing up the programme the Committee were .reminded of the absence from it of any attractive Bills, and ministers were accordingly invited to suggest any Bills of amore popular nature which might be added to the programme inthe event of the Session being a lengthy one.      Notes on Billssuggested for this purpose are. embodied in Annex B.5. The Committee felt that the special attention of theCabinet should be drawn to the following points:-(a)   No progress has been possible so far with the prepar-ation of the Court Martial Procedure Bill because the interimreport of the Pilcher Committee is not yet available.      Apartfrom the fact that the Bill seems likely to be highly contentions-tious, the Committee thought it unlikely that it could beintroduced during the 1950 Session because the drafting of a major Bill of this type is a lengthy process and it could hardly be ready early enough to ensure its passage.

(b)    There are some Bills the need for which is not yetcertain (e.g. the Allied Forces Bill) and there are also oneor two Bills which it would be desirable to pass but for whichit is unlikely that time can be found.     All these have beenlisted in Group VI.6. The Committee invite the Cabinet(1)   To approve Groups I to VI of Annex A to thismemorandum as the legislative programme for the1950 Session;    and(2)   To authorise the Legislation Committee, after thecommencement of the new Session, to keep the. programme under constant review and to add toit from time to time, subject to policy approvalhaving been obtained, any of the Bills listed in annex B which may appear likely to pass.H.

ANNEX BBILLS WHICH -IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO ADD TO THE1950 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME IN THE EVENT OF ALENGTHY SESSIONDepartmentLord Chancellor1sDepartmentBillLeaseholdEnfranchisementRemarksThe report of the LeaseholdCommittee is now expected tohe presented at the end ofthis year and it may bedesirable to introduce legis-lation as a result of this,though it seems doubtfulwhether the Bill could be drafted In time.Ministry ofAgricultureand FisheriesMarginal LandBoard of TradeAccountantsA Bill to provide assistance for the improvement of marginal land of a more extensive character than ispossible under the existingmarginal land productionscheme.      There is little doubt that such a Bill would prove popular in rural areas.The accountancy profession havealready prepared a Bill whichthey had hoped might be spon-sored by a Private Member.It is designed to give theman enhanced professionalstatus and the Board o-f trade might be willing to take theBill over as a government measure.Ministry of Townand CountryPlanningPlanningTown and Country A Bill to amend the 1947 Act,The Ministerial Committeewhich has been set up toconsider the principles onwhich development charges are determined might producerecommendations which wouldhave some attraction.      Onthe other hand this is an extremely intricate branch ofthe law and any proposals for amendment require the most careful consideration.Drafting would of course bedifficult and it might be veryhard to restrict the  scope ofthe Bill so as to preventundesirable criticism oramendments.

department ministry of Townand CountryPlanningBillRestoration of iron OreWorkingsRemarksThis Bill might be popular inthe East Midlands but itwould probably involveexpenditure from theExchequer.      Other diffi-culties arise from the complexity of the law andfrom the arrangements for the nationalisation of the ironand steel industry..     Finallythere is the moratorium where-by acquisition by the Stateof development values inminerals is deferred untilJuly, 1951, and the paymentof development charges bymineral operations becomesdue at the same date.
