THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1949CONFIDENTIALCopy Nor. -CP. (49) 21728th October, 1949DEVELOPMENT OF JOINT CONSULTATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in accordance with the undertaking I gave at the meeting of the Cabinet on13th October (CM. (49) 58th Conclusions, Minute 1), I submit herewith a paper on joint consultations. It had already been prepared by my Department forconsideration by the National Joint Advisory Council (N.J.A.C:) at their meeting on 26th October and records in general terms the progress to date. It also includes observations on the obstacles with which my Department is faced.2. The N.J.A.C., after consideration of the paper, passed the followingresolution: &quot;At their meeting in April 1947 the National Joint Advisory Councilapproved the principle of the setting up of joint production committeeswhere they did not already exist for the regular exchange of views between employers and workers, the machinery to be voluntary and advisory and theform of it to be left to be determined by each industry through its ordinarynegotiating arrangements. The British Employers&apos; Confederation (B.E.C.)and the T.U.C. brought this recommendation to the notice of their constituentorganisations and the Council now noted with satisfaction the very substan-tial progress made during the last 2^ years in the establishment of these joint committees. At the same time the Council were conscious of the fact thatsome indifference and even objection was still being encountered and theCouncil agreed that the national organisations should again be asked torecommend to their constituent bodies the urgent desirability of extending aswidely as possible the establishment of this form of joint machinery.&quot;2. I would take the opportunity of reiterating my view that the only hope ofmore substantial further progress lies in a campaign directed by the union executives to their local officials and shop stewards, because the fundamentaldifficulty is the lack of interest on the part of the ordinary rank-and-file employee.3. The subject will be considered further by the Joint Consultative Com-mittee which, with the agreement of the N.J.A.C., is being reformed in order todeal with any general labour issues arising in connection with the necessity forincreased production.G.

ANNEXN.J.C. 66Ministry of Labour and National Service t &quot;National Joint Advisory CouncilDevelopment of Joint Consultation1. A Report (N.J.C. 44) was submitted to the Council in January of thisyear showing the progress which had been made in the setting up of joint consultative machinery in industry and making proposals for further assisting theestablishment and development of such machinery. An Appendix to this papergives an up-to-date account of the position reached in the most important industries at national level with regard to joint consultation; V The following isan account of the additional steps which the Ministry has taken or is taking to stimulate and maintain an interest in this important subject.    .........2. A further approach has been made to a number of Joint industrial councils, mainly those shown in sub-paragraph (d) of the Appendix, which hadearlier taken the view that Joint Consultative Committees in the factory Wereunnecessary because the machinery; of the Council was adequate to deal with matters requiring joint consultation. As a result of this approach three of thejoint organisations agreed that officers of the Ministry should give information and advice on the establishment of joint consultative machinery to individual firms which desired to have it. One industry maintained its original attitude.Final replies from the remainder are awaited.&quot;3. At the meeting of the Council on 26th January, 1949, approval was givento a proposal that a supplement to the Industrial Relations Handbook should bepublished setting out the national agreements on joint consultation in various industries. The supplement, which has involved the collection of information from many sources, will be ready for printing shortly. Where industries havedecided not to recommend any precise form of joint consultative machinery thesupplement will contain an agreed statement setting out the views of the national joint organisation.4. Another proposal adopted by the Council in January was that an oppor-tunity should be given in the Regions for an interchange of views and experiencebetween persons actually engaged in the day-to-day administration of joint consultative bodies. In accordance with this proposal Regional industrial relations Officers, assisted by Personnel Management Advisers, have organisedconferences on &quot;Joint Consultative Machinery How it Works.&quot; Firms knownto have some form of works committee or other joint body have been invited tosend as representatives one or two responsible officials who are concerned withits work. The response has been encouraging; in more than one place the numberof firms interested was so large that it was found necessary to have two extraconferences. ,:.! .Twenty-seven of these &apos;&apos; Know-how&apos;&apos; conferences have already been held in large industrial centres in the Northern, East and West Ridings, London andSouth-Eastern, Southern, South-Western, - Wales, Midlands, North-Western(including 3 for cotton and other textiles) and Scotland Regions. Eleven moreconferences have been arranged to take place before the end of November andothers are being planned. Those held have undoubtedly been useful. The discus-sions, which have included such subjects as the scope and organisation of thecommittees, methods of preparing the agenda and of spreading information afterthe meetings, have, for the most part, been lively and constructive. Difficulties(and how to overcome them) have been frankly discdssed as well as successes. A.-the end of some conferences requests have been made for further meetings; atothers it has been agreed that firms with a written constitution for their joint consultative organisations would send copies to those attending the conference^In some cases invitations have been given by firms with long experience or ,]oincommittees to other firms to attend meetings of their committees as visitors.
5. Earlier this year arrangements were made with the Headquartersorganisation of the Regional Boards for Industry for conferences to be held inthe Regions jointly by the Economic Information Unit and this Ministry, underthe aegis of the Regional Board, on the subjects of works information and joint consultation. The aim of the conferences is to stimulate interest in these subjectsamong firms which have little practical experience of joint consultation,or of a fully developed works information service. A number of conferences have beenheld and it is the general opinion that they have had valuable results. Theservices of the Ministry&apos;s Personnel Management Advisers have been madeavailable to firms which, as a result of the conferences, required more detailed information and advice.6. Considerable progress has been made by socialised industries towardsthe establishment of machinery for joint consultation. The National Coal Boardand the British Electricity Authority have reached agreement with their respectivetrade unions providing for joint consultative councils or committees afc-natibnal,district and local levels. The British Transport Commission has set up a national joint consultative council on which the six executives and the trade unions are represented. In its own sphere the Railway Executive has recently put into effect a scheme for joint consultation with railways staff at national, regional and locallevels. The London Transport Executive operates the joint consultative machinerycreated by the London Passenger Transport Board. The Civil Airways Corpora-tion have made provision for joint consultation through the National joint council for Civil Air Transport and Local Panel Committees; these arrangements are at present under review.A detailed account of the consultative machinery established in the socialised industries will be included in the supplement to the Industrial RelationsHandbook. -7. At the request of the Human Factors Panel of the; Committee on industrial Productivity, the National Institute of Industrial Psychology is carrying out a research into the working of joint consultation at factory level.The enquiry, which began in August 1948, includes detailed investigation intothe practice of joint consultation at a number of factories, and is expected to takenot less than two years.8; Where there are national agreements on joint consultation the degreeof implementation varies from industry to industry and from firm to firm withinthe same industry. In general, the amount of obstruction from employers is small,but there is a much larger degree of indifference hoth oh the part of individual employers and of their workpeople. This springs partly from a misconception on both sides of the real purpose of joint consultation. To many employers it signifiesat the most an opportunity for their workers to take an interest in such matters as welfare and staff canteens and to air their grievances. To many workers it is associated with a drive for increasing output in order to increase the profits ofthe firm. This indifference can only be overcome by a persistent campaign directed to make clear the primary purpose of joint consultation as a means of improvinggeneral relationships in the factory, and by a tabling of information and ideasto encourage mutual confidence and co-operation.As far as individual firms are concerned, the conferences now being organised by this Department and those run under the aegis of Regional Boards are, it isconsidered, a most fruitful means of gaining on the employers&apos; side a widerappreciation of joint consultation. Approval in principle by the employers&apos;national and district associations is of course a prerequisite. On the workers&apos;side experience suggests that in many industries more positive encouragementat national and district levels would do much to dissipate local hesitation andindifference. To this end education in the aims and methods of real joint consulta-tion is a primary necessity. There is evidence to show that where local instruction,f-9-i in technical colleges, has been provided, sometimes as part of a wider coursem industrial organisation and management, the response from workers&apos; repre-sentatives has been encouraging and has shown that there is a genuine desiretor unbiased information arid advice. An extension of this form of educationwould, it is considered, be one of the most effective means of creating real interestand enthusiasm on the workers&apos;side.18th October, 1949.
