HIS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos;S E C R E TCP. (49) 239 COPY NO. J)21 ST NOVEMBER. 1949CABINETPINANOES OF THE BRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Minister of Transport -The operations of the British Transport Commissionduring 1948, which v/as the first year of their existence,resulted in a net revenue deficit of  4? millions.     In their first annual report, which covered this period, the Commissionstated (paragraph 69)that the trends of traffic receipts and ofexpenditure indicated that with the existing levels of fares,rates and charges a marked deterioration of the working resultswas inevitable in 1949*     Events have confirmed this forecast,and the net revenue deficiency for the current year isestimated to be of the order of  25 millions.     The accumulateddeficiency at the end of 1949 will thus be some  30 millions which must, ultimately, be met out of the Commission&apos;srevenues if a charge is not to fall upon the Exchequer.      Inthe view of the Commission the position during 1950 is likelyto deteriorate rather than improve unless they are authorisedto increase certain of their charges.      Since they assumedtheir.responsibilities they have been faced with greatlyincreased costs in regard to both labour and materials.     Theexisting level of charges, which on the railways (which con-stitute by far the largest part of the Commission&apos;s under-taking) are no more than 55 per cent above those made beforethe war, is quite insufficient to meet these costs.      TheCommission stated in their report that it is not possible thatany undertaking which is to pay its way (as the commission are required to do under the Transport Act) should submit toconstant increases in the cost of the services and commodities which it needs, and yet refrain indefinitely from raising itsprices to its customers.2. Apart from increases in the cost of labour, thefigure of 55 per cent by which railway charges have been increased since the outbreak of war may be compared v/ith thefollowing percentage increases in the cost of some of the mostimportant materials used by the Commission:-Percentage Increase,mid-1949 over pre-warIron and Steel 105Coal 180Non-ferrous metals 136Timber 291All other stores 123It is not surprising in view of such figures that theCommission, in spite of every effort to effect economies, areunable to make both ends meet on the basis of their existing powers of charge.

3. The Commission have accordingly, as a matter of urgency, applied to me to exercise my powers under Section 82of the Transport Act to authorise an increase in certain oftheir charges.      The broad effect of the increased powers of charge sought is as follows;-Railway Charges;A general increase of 16.2/3 per cent in the presentcharges applicable to freight train traffic and toparcels, other merchandise and livestock carried by passenger train or other similar service.Dock Charges;(a) Dues on coastwise vessels and cargoes - the present general increase of 25 per cent over charges inforce on 31st August, 1939* to be raised to 50per cent.(b) All other rates, dues and charges - the present general increase of 75 per cent over charges inforce on 31st August, 1939, to be raised to100 per cent.It is estimated that these increases would yieldadditional revenue to the Commission of some  28 millions ayear and I share their view that an addition of this order isnecessary if the Commission are to meet current net revenuedeficiencies without any provision for reserves or for making good past losses.h. The Commission do not propose any increase in passenger fares, as it is their view that this would not resultin an improvement in receipts on the main line railways.      Iam convinced that they are right on this point, apart fromthe effect that any increase in railway passenger fares wouldbe likely to have on public opinion.The Commission inform me, however, that they intendshortly to submit a charges scheme dealing with passenger fares, both road ard rail, in the London Passenger TransportArea.     The increased revenue which they hope to obtain as aresult of this scheme would be required in addition to the 28 millions referred to above.5. The normal procedure laid down in the Transport Actfor determining the Commissions charges is the submission bythem of charges schemes to tho Transport Tribunal.      Thepreparation of such schemesy however, must inevitably in thecase of railway charges take a considerable time, and pendingtheir introduction I am empowered by Section 82 of the transport act to maker regulations authorising an increase in charges ifI think it expedient to do so with a view to ensuring asufficient revenue to the Commission.      The Section is,  infact, desired to deal with just s\ich a situation as has arisen.Before making regulations, however,  I am required to consult with and consider the advice of the permanent members of theTransport Tribunal, acting as a Consultative Committee.6. I have had informal discussions with the Chairmen ofthe Tribunal and of the Commission and propose to ref:r thematter to the Consultative Committee in&quot;the terms given inAppendix a.

7. It is, in my view, desirable that I should make astatement in the House on a matter of such importance, andthe terms.in.which I should propose to make it are indicatedin Appendix. B.8. The Commission&apos;s current net revenue losses are running at over &amp;k million a week and I therefore seek theconcurrence of my colleagues as a matter of urgency to -(a) a reference, in the terms of Appendix A, ofthe Commission&apos;s application to the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal acting as a consultative Committee;(b) my making a statement in the House of commons on the lines of Appendix B.inistry of Transport, W. 1.21 ST NOVEMBER,  1949.

APPENDIX ADRAFT LETTER TO THE CHAIRMANOF THE TRANSPORT TRIBUNALSir,The Minister having received an Application fromthe British Transport Commission to authorise the Commission,with a view to ensuring a sufficient Revenue to theCommission, to make, in respect of certain of the servicesand facilities provided by them, charges estimated to produceadditional gross revenue of  28 millions a year, additional to those in operation under the statutory provisions regul-ating the same, desires to consult with and receive theadvice of   the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal toassist him in determining whether regulations to give effectto the Commission&apos;s proposals, and if so to what extent, oughtin the circumstances to be made under the provisions ofSection 82(1) of the Transport Act, 19h7*      The Minister isin agreement with the Commission that additional revenue ofthis order is necessary.A copy of the British Transport Commission&apos;application is enclosed.     The Minister regards the matter as one of extreme urgency calling for the bringing into forceof any regulations (particularly those relating to railway charges) which it may be expedient to make   at the earliestpossible date.The Commission do not propose any increase in passenger fares and the Minister is in agreement with theirviews on this point.The Minister will be glad if the Committee will consider the British Transport Commission^ application andappoint a day to hear the appropriate officers of theCommission.Having regard to the interests affected by theBritish Transport Commission^ application, the Committeewill no doubt think it desirable to invite the attendance ofsuch representative bodies of traders and shipping as theythink fit and take their views into consideration.I am to add that the Minister does not desire theCommittee&apos;s report on the proposed increases in railway charges to be delayed pending any investigation of those relating to dock charges if the Committee find that they canreport earlier by dealing with the two matters separately.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,

APPENDIX draft STATEMENT TO BE MADE BY&quot;&quot; THE MINISTER OF transport i think that the House will wish to he informedthat the British Transport Commission have made an applica-tion to me to make regulations under Section 82 of theTransport Act for the purpose of authorising an increase incertain of their charges.Honourable Members will be aware that the.Commission^ net revenue deficiency for 1948 was  44 millions and that the Commission indicated in paragraph 69 of their first Annual Report that a further marked deterioration ofthe working results in. 1949 was inevitable.At present it appears likely that the net revenuedeficiency for the current year will be of the order of  25millions and present indications are that it would be greater in 1950 on the basis of existing charges apart from anyquestion of recouping the accrued deficiency.      I therefore consider it expedient with a view to ensuring a sufficientrevenue to the Commission that the question of an increasein their charges should be examined with the least possible delay.I have accordingly, in conformity with the pro-visions of Soction 82 of the Transport Act, decided to consult with and consider the advice in this matter of the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal acting as a consultative committee.      In doing so I have expressed the view that theywill no doubt think it desirable-1o consult with such represen-tative bodies of traders and shipping as they think fit and take their views into consideration.The Commission do not propose any increase in passenger fares and I have informed the Committee that I am inagreement with the Commission on this point.The increased powers of charges sought by theCommission are in effect:-RaiIway Charge s:A general increase of 16.2/3 per cent in the presentcharges applicable to freight train traffic and to parcels,other merchandise and livestock carried by passenger train orother similar service.Dock Charges;(a) Dues on Coastwise vessels and cargoes - the present general increase of 25 per cent over charges inforce on 31 st August, 1939, &quot;to be raised to 50 percent;(b) all other rates, dues, and charges - the present general increase of 75 per cent over charges inforce on that date to be raised to 100 per cent.For the convenience of Honourable Members I am havingcopies of the Commission1s application and the reference to theCommittee placed in the Library.
