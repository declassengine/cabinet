REPRESENTATIVES AND COLONIAL GOVERNORSMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues will recall that on 18th October I circulated to them a memorandum (CP. (49) 207) about our general policy in South East Asia and the Far East.     that memorandum was designed to serve as guidance to the delegatesattending a conference of H. M. Representatives and colonial governors in the area.      In the present memorandum I give, forthe information of my colleagues, an account of the proceedingsof that conference.2. The conference was held from 2nd to 4th Novemberunder the Chairmanship of Mr.  Malcolm MacDonald, Commissioner-General in South East Asia.   - The Ministerial representative ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government was the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for the Colonies, Mr. Rees-Williams, and the ForeignOffice were represented by Mr. M. E.  Dening.      The following were also present:    His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Nanking,Tokyo, Bangkok, Rangoon, and Manila, the Acting British&quot;Consuls-General at Saigon and Batavia, the United Kingdom Deputy HighCommissioner in New Delhi, the Governors of Singapore andHongkong, the High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya,the Chief Secretaries of North Borneo and Sarawak, and theGommanders-in-Chief, Far East.3. The conference was similar in form to the conferenceof His Majesty&apos;s Representatives convened by Mr. MacDonald inNovember, 1948, though wider in scope since,  on this occasion,H. M. Ambassadors in China and Japan, H. M.  Minister in the philippines, and the United Kingdom Deputy High commissioner in New Delhi were present.4. My colleagues will already have seen the telegrams from Singapore reporting the conclusions reached by the con-ference on various subjects.      These conclusions are now being studied.      Where consultation with my colleagues is necessary before action is taken arising out of the conference, I shallcirculate papers dealing with specific subjects.      Inparticular, I shall circulate a further paper about recognitionof the Communist Government of China.3.    &apos; The main purpose of the conference was to exchangeviews, and I think my colleagues will agree that it served thispurpose well and that its conclusions, the substance of whichI give below, deserve careful study.Conclusions of the Conference.6.      Recognition of the Communist Government of China.The conference agreed that British interests in Chinaand Hongkong demanded the earliest possible de jure recognitionof the Communist Government of China.      The general situation-1-

in South East Asia also made it desirable that recognitionshould be accorded before the end of this year.      It was agreedthat recognition should be accompanied by three measures:-(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government should state unilaterallythat they assume that the new Government accept,China&apos;s existing international obligations.(b) At the same time as recognition is granted, resistance-tance to Communism in South East Asia should be strengthened.(c) British propaganda should explain that there isno inconsistency in a policy which recognises the Communist Government in China and at thesame time intensifies resistance to Communismin South East Asia.7.      Probable effects of recognition of Communist China inSouth East Asian countries.It was agreed that, as far as United Kingdom terri-tories were concerned, recognition of Communist China would inno way affect the attitude of the Chinese communities of those territories.      These communities have already tacitly acceptedthe Chinese Communist Government.      The appointment of chinese communist Consuls in colonial territories would present theColonial Governments with a difficult problem, but by itselfthis should not be allowed to delay the granting of recognition.Of the- foreign territories in South East Asia only Burma andIndo-China would be sensibly affected by the granting of recognition.      In Burma it would encourage the near-Communisttendencies of the powerful Burmese Socialism-Party, and in Indo-China it would seriously undermine the (confidence^ of Bao Dai andthe confidence of the Indo-Chinese people-in-Bao Dai (but seeparagraph 9 below).      In the case of India it would be India&apos;responsibility to safeguard the status quo in Tibet as far as this could be done by a unilateral declaration.8.      South East Asian Regional Problems - General.(a) The conference welcomed a statement by Mr. Rees-Williams of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy in South east asia based on the memorandum circulated with CP. (h9) 207*It was agreed that the long-term objective of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s policy in South East Asia should be the creationof a regional pact through which the Governments of the areacould work in partnership with the countries belonging to theNorth Atlantic Pact and also with Australia and New Zealand.Since, however, the present situation in South East Asia wasnot favourable for attempts to create such a pact in the nearfuture an initial approach should be made by the stimulation ofeconomic co-operation in the region.(b) The conference considered that the danger from Communiwas so great and imminent in South East Asia that energeticshort-term action was required irrespective of steps which itmight be possible to take to attain the long-term objective.In the opinion of the conference the Chinese Communists were unlikely to attempt military aggression beyond their frontiers;but it was thought that they could be expected to stimulateconspiracy against and subversion of orderly government inSouth East Asia at the earliest opportunity.(c) It was agreed that Indo-China would probably be theimmediate objective of Communist action in this sense and that thereafter attempts -would be made to overthrow the existingregimes in Slam and Burma.      If these attempts were successfulthe South East Asian Communist Parties would have gained control

over the great rice-growing countries of the world and through them would have a strangle-hold on the whole of Asia.      More-over, the frontiers of Malaya and India would be directlythreatened and the long-term policy of His Majesty1s Governmentwould have become impracticable.(d)    The conference therefore concluded that South east asia should be regarded as a region in which an emergencyexists and that policy towards it should be pursued with a proper consequential note of urgency.9.      Indo-China.The conference concluded that if the Bao Daiexperiment failed French withdrawal from Indo-China would&apos;become inevitable, with disastrous effects on our generalstrategic position in South East Asia.      It was therefore recommended that every possible assistance should be given tothe French in their attempt to rally and consolidate theVietnamese - national movement round Bao Dai.      Specifically,the conference made four recommendations:-(a) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should grant de factorecognition to Bao Dai immediately after thetransfer of power on 1st January, and de jure recognition after ratification by both parties ofthe agreement between the French and Bao Dai;(b) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should encourage theFrench Government to&apos; make all possible concessions to Bao Dai, to transfer Indo-Chinese affairs fromthe Ministry of Overseas   France to the Ministryof Foreign Affairs, and to give assurances that-t-hey would agree to the extension of Vietnamesediplomatic representation abroad;(c) that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment should publish a declaration about theTongkinese frontier similar to Mr. Acheson&apos;declaration about the Honkong frontier (in which he pointed out at a press conference that if Hongkongwere attacked the United States would be preparedto carry out its obligations as a member of theSecurity Council);(d) that the present ban on close co-operation with theFrench authorities in Indo-China with regard toanti-Communist propaganda should be lifted.10.      Siam.The conference considered that it was essential, inview of Siam&apos;s strategic importance, to do everything possibleto strengthen the determination of the present Siamese GOvern-ment to resist Communist, infiltration and pressure.      In orderto do this and in order to maintain the political stability of siam under the existing regime it was recommended that everyeffort should be made to meet Siam&apos;s requirements in the purchaseof military equipment and in the strengthening of her economic position (for example, by permitting her if possible to float apublic loan in London next year, and by allowing, for politicalfactors in negotiations in such matters as British war claims against Siam).11.      Burma.The conference concluded that,  since the chaoticsituation in Burma rendered that country acutely vulnerable toinfiltration and exploitation by the Chinese Communists,  every

effort must &quot;be made to promote a settlement of the dispute between the Burmese Government and the Karens.      It was recommended that :this&apos; matter should be discussed with theGovernment of India with a view to devising some solution atan early date.12.    Machinery for dealing with the emergency in South East AsiaThe conference concluded that measures taken in london to deal with the needs of the South East Asian area needed to be accelerated.      It &quot;was recommended that early steps should betaken to ensure that inter-departmental consultation reachedquick decisions on requests for assistance for South East Asia.13.    United States Representation in South East Asia.The conference considered that United States represen-tation in South East Asia was&quot;not on the whole of very highcalibre and,since it was essential that the United StatesGovernment should be able to see the South East Asian picturecorrectly through the eyes of their own observers, it was hopedthat Dr.  Jessup&apos;s forthcoming tour in South East Asia would leadto a greater realisation hy the United States Government ofthe emergency in South East Asian affairs.E.
