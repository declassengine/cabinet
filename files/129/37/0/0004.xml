COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in CP. (49) 200 of 10th October* gave an account of developments in theCouncil of Europe during its first session at Strasbourg in August and Septemberlast and a summary of the recommendations and resolutions which resulted fromthe work of the Consultative Assembly. I explained that these recommendations and resolutions would come before the Committee of Ministers early in november and I undertook to put forward in a separate paper my suggestion as to the line i might be authorised to adopt in the Committee on that occasion.2. I now circulate as an Annex to this paper a summary of the, mainconclusions from the briefs which have been prepared by various GovernmentDepartments on individual items in the Assembly&apos;s recommendations. these conclusions have for the most part not received ministerial approval and I should like to know that my colleagues now approve them. In order, however, to enable a proper judgment to be formed on these individual matters it is necessary to review in somewhat general terms the nature&apos; and functions xof the Council ofEurope as&apos;it has emerged.from its first session, and to see where His Majesty&apos;sGovernment stand in regard to it. After this review it may be possible to agree on certain broad principles which should guide us in our dealings both with theCommittee of Ministers and with the Assembly and which may also be relevantin the case of other European organisations in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentparticipate.3. I do not expect that at their meeting on 3rd November the Committee ofMinisters will be called upon to accept or reject any of the more far reaching ofthe Assembly&apos;s proposals. Most of these proposals, and particularly those which involve degrees of surrender of sovereignty to a European authority or of financialand economic integration between the participating countries,, will clearly require a great deal of careful study, and the natural Xhing for the Committee of ministers to do will be either to refer them back to the Assembly for further elucidationor to set up some working party or sub-committee of their own to examine them.There are, however, certain important questions on which an early decision willbe required and on which it is desirable-that the views of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be made clear at the outset.  These fall broadly into two parts : (1) Questions affecting the character and functions of the Council of Europeitself, including amendments to the Statute and requests for additionalsessions, standing committees, &amp;c.; and(2) New accessions, including notably the question of:German accession.No clear view can be reached on these questions until the broad lines of policyin regard to our relations with the Council of Europe have been clarified.Summary of recommendations.   The following are the recommendations which I ask my colleagues to approve in connection with the forthcoming meeting of; the Committee of37745 -dPrinted for the Cabinet: October 1949 - 1SECRET 01-.

Ministers. They derive from the general conclusions set out in the later para-graphs of this paper : ;(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to support the Council,ofEurope and to play an active part in its development.(&amp;) Under existing policy, however, we cannot agree to any proposals whichmean our getting involved in the economic affairs of Europe beyondthe point at which we could, if we wished, disengage ourselves. Thereare no grounds for abandoning this policy.(c) Any surrender of political sovereignty in matters of vital importancewould jeopardise our ability to maintain the policy at (b). We must therefore maintain a very strict reserve in regard to schemes for the pooling of sovereignty or the establishment of European supra-nationalmachinery.id) Subject to (b) and (c) above, we should adopt a positive attitude towardsproposals for co-operation in the political, social and cultural fields andshould welcome the development of the Consultative Assembly into a responsible quasi-parliamentary body in which European points of views are advocated. We need not object to amendments to the Statutedesigned to give the Assembly greater independence or to increase its efficiency and prestige, so long^is they do not enable it to stray beyondits &quot;consultative function. (Tnis would mean opposing the proposal that the Assembly should have a veto on new accessions.) By the sametoken we should agree to the provision of finance for the StandingCommittee, the General Affairs Committee and (until its work isfinished) the Committee on Rules of Procedure; but should not providefor the permanent maintenance of the other committees which theAssembly have set up.(e) We should not support the proposal for a Special Session early in1950. ;.,&apos;:&apos;(/) In order to maintain the principle that the elaboration of agreementbetween Governments is the business of the Committee of Ministersrather than of the Assembly, we should support where necessary theestablishment of sub-committees of the Committee of Ministers forthe purpose of studying proposals submitted by the Assembly and of preparing texts for agreement between Governments.(g) Wherever it is clear that proposals under discussion at Strasbourg canmore effectively and economically be dealt with in the context ofO.E.E.C. or other European international organs we should support their reference to those bodies. We should bear in mind at all stagesthe strain placed upon national administrations by the multiplicationof international organisations: i(h) In the cultural and social fields we should support the widest practicabledegree of co-operation between Members. In particular we shouldadvocate the extension of some of the non-military work of the brussels treaty into the wider field of the Council of Europe; and we should look favourably in principle upon the conclusion of a Convention of human Rights.(i) We should endeavour to get the Committee of Ministers to issue a state-ment to the effect that if the German Federal Republic desires to beinvited to join as an Associate Member and accepts the principles ofthe Statute, an invitation will be issued to it. If necessary in orderto secure French agreement to this we could agree to the admissionof the Saar as an Associate Member at the same time! The questionof Austria should be left over until the results of the Peace treaty negotiations are clearer.General Discussion5. His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed by Treaty to support theCouncil of Europe and its aims as defined in the preamble to &quot;the Statute, which include the achievement of &quot; a greater unity between its Members . . . .&quot; Apartfrom this general and paper obligation the Government are committed, if only by the prominent and effective role which Ministers played in the critical opening
session this year,.to encourage the development of the Consultative Assembly as aserious.quasi-parliamentary institution, independent of Governments,but havingthe duty of advocating European points of, view on all matters within itscompetence. j &quot;6. Judged as an experiment in European parliamentary association and within the limits which were set, the Consultative Assembly can be said to havemade a successful start. Many of the fears felt beforehand as to what mightemerge Irdm ah Assembly consisting of delegates hot responsible to their Govern-ments were falsified in the event, and on the whole the Assembly steered its way&quot;successfully between empty talk on the one side and excessive ambition on theother. For this success the British Delegation had a large responsibility. Thevery success of the experiment from the point of view of organisation and publicity, however, may increase our difficulties in dealing with the practical implications. It is inevitable and natural that any body of this kind should tendto favour the creation of supra-national machinery which would in effect increase its own powers; and by its very existence it will constitute a form of pressure infavour of speedier and more radical unification in Europe than Governments are willing to accept.: There will therefore be a growing possibility of conflict between the Governments and the Assembly.7. The Council of Europe is an important element in the structure whichwe have been building up in Europe with the object of creating a feeling ofconfidence and unity amongst the Western.nations. Together with the brussels treaty, the O.E.E.C., and the Atlantic Pact, it is one of the major weapons inthe cold war. Whatever, therefore, may be our opinion as to the ultimate relation-ship between this country and the Continent, or between the continental nations,we should do nothing now to undermine the general hopes of solidarity and co-operation which the Council of Europe has aroused in Europe. Stated in purelystrategical terms, the most immediate task is to prevent war by the double methodof deterring an aggressor and encouraging a mood of resistance in our Allies.Therefore the&quot; cold war &quot; and the building up of Western European morale musthave a high priority in our thinking. Any ostentatious weakening of Britishsupport for the Council of Europe might have disastrous effects oh opinion inFrance, Italy, the Benelux countries and elsewhere. It might also destroy all,hope of bringing Germany into close political association with the West.8. Account must also be taken of American views. It is difficult to estimatewhat United States public opinion or&apos; Congress think about economic union inEurope and the position of the United Kingdom in regard to it, as the balance ofopinion is apt to shift from time to time. There is a strong body of public feeling in the United States which expects Europe, with or without the United Kingdom,to get together politically and economically as a price for the continuance ofUnited States aid. This school of thought has in particular many adherents inthe Economic Co-operation Administration. Any appearance on our part ofsabotaging such enterprises as the Council of Europe would certainly have serious results on American opinion. The truth is probably that most Americans do not expect this country to enter into, any exclusive political or economic association with continental countries, and current American official policy is against it.But we should still be attacked in the United States if we could be shown to bepreventing European unification by what? might be represented as a - selfishattitude.- &apos; : r; /:,:9. It is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government must maintain certain basicreserves in regard to the Council -of Europe. The careful phraseology of theStatute and the obvious caution of the Governments in their approach to itcannot conceal the fact that the Assembly provides a forum where His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be exposed to continuous pressure, not only from the representa-tives of the other counties but also from British enthusiasts for European union,to undertake measures of unification beyond what they consider desirable oracceptable to the British people. Already the Assembly have.declared (para-graph IV (1) of the enclosure to M. Spaak&apos;s letter of 9th September reproducedas Appendix A to the report annexed to C.P.(49) 200) that they regard one oftheir aims and objects as being &quot;the establishment of a European political authority with limited functions but real powers.&quot; We cannot accept such adoctrine as an aim of British policy.   On the economic side in particular our-  37745 T5 o  v&quot;
existing policy, which is set out in E.P.C. (49) 6 of 2 th January, 1949, lays down that, though we may make considerable sacrifices for the sake of European; eco-:nomic co-operation, we should not run risks which would jeopardise our ownchances of survival if the attempt to restore Western Europe should fail, andthat we should not involve ourselves in the economic affairs of Europe beyond thepoint at which we could, if we wished, disengage ourselves., I know of nothing,which should lead us to modify this policy; in fact the recent Conference of commonwealth Finance Ministers and the Washington conversations point rather the other way. The economic implications and justification of this policy lieoutside the scope of this paper. It seems clear.that.our general attitude towardsthe economic resolution of the Assembly should be one of great caution; but fortactical purposes it may well be best, during the forthcoming meeting of theCommittee of Ministers, that I should endeavour to induce my colleagues .toshow their hands first. Otherwise the tendency of the Committee of ministers will, undoubtedly be to try to fasten on the United Kingdom all the blame fortheir inability to proceed with European economic unity on the lines which, theAssembly obviously desires.10. It is clear therefore that there exists a potential conflict between apolicy of full participation in the Council of Europe and the wider Interests whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government are always obliged to keep in mind. Our relationship with the rest of the Commonwealth and, almost equally important, our new relationship with the United States ensure that we must remain, as we have,always been in the past, different in character from Other European nations andfundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them. How soon orhow sharply this conflict may come to light in Strasbourg or elsewhere is bardto say. One of the principal disadvantages of the Council of Europe from thepoint of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that by its nature it brings such issues under the glare of public discussion, where it is much more difficult than itwould be in an ordinary governmental context to sustain the traditional non-committal and two-way facing policy of this country. Much will depend on theextent to which other European Governments, as distinct from their representa-tives in the Assembly, desire to press for the acceptance of proposals involvingpolitical or economic integration. It is not likely that such pressure will ariseat once. Even in the Assembly there was not a majority in favour of schemesfor immediate economic or political union and it was, I understand, largelyfortuitous that the economic recommendations were not remitted for further study to a Standing Committee, as were the various proposals for political union.None of the Governments has declared itself to be in favour of schemes of thiskind and if we show a certain caution we shall certainly not be alone. It is alsoworth noting that there is now a divergence of opinion in the Opposition onthis subject, and that as a purely internal, political proposition the campaign for European Union, as conducted by Mr.. Sandys land the European Movement,is unlikely to commend itself in its extreme form to any party in the House ofCommons.11. It should, in my view, be our object to postpone as long as possible beingfaced with a choice between, on the one hand, overstepping the limits of safetyin integration with Europe and, on the other, appearing&apos; to abandon the ideas ofthe Council of Europe. To this end it will be necessary for us to balance ourcaution in the matter of economic and political integration with a policy ofencouragement and support for co-operation in other fields. There are, I think,three ways in which we can do this. First we can support the requests of theAssembly in regard to its own independence and activities so long as these staywithin the limits of a consultative body. We can agree to the amendments proposed in the Statute for giving the Assembly complete control over its agenda.I do not believe that it is practicable or worth while to oppose the wishes of theAssembly on these issues. The control which the Statute gives the Committee ofMinisters over the Assembly&apos;s agenda is impossible to exercise in practice, andany self-respecting body of parliamentarians would be bound to resist it. Weshould, of course, retain the ban on any discussion relating to defence. We could also well allow the Assembly to abolish substitutes and increase (but not double)the number of representatives, and we could agree to the appointment of anadditional Deputy Secretary-General to serve the Assembly. I think the Com-mittee of Ministers should approve and provide finance for the StandingCommittee and the General Affairs Committee which the Assembly has set up,
because it is only natural that an Assembly ^require some continuingmachinery to prepareits work and: represent its interests;;In addition, it is reasonable to&quot; allow the&apos; Committee ok: Rules of Procedure tomeet out of Session until it has drawn &apos;Up revised&apos;&quot;Rules-of-Procedure for theAssembly. I do not think, however; that we should agree to finance the operation,between Sessions, of the other Committees which the Assembly has set&apos; up. Todo so would be to make the Assembly to all intents and purposes an/all-the-year-round institution, contrary to, the intentionsi of the Statute. We must alsostrongly oppose the suggestion that the Assembly should be given the right of veto over candidates for membership that have been approved by the Committeeof Ministers. To give the Assembly such a right would undoubtedly diminish the power of Governments to take decisions in the field of foreign affairs. after all, the ;Assembly consists .of; individual parliamentarians who only representthemselves, and it seems to follow that Governments cannot possibly divestthemselves of any of their responsibilities in favour of an Assembly constituted in this way. . .y..:.^..i;- -12. Secondly, we should endeavour to be as forthcoming as possible in regardto all proposals which do not involve committing His Majesty&apos;s Government to;political and economic union; In particular we should look favourably upon theidea of a Convention of Human Rights and, in principle, upon the social and cultural resolutions. In these fields the five Brussels Treaty Powers have aparticular contribution to make and I propose to recommend that they.should submit a full report to the Committee of Ministers on the work so far achieved!by them, together with.suggestions as to how this could be expanded to cover the twelve&quot; Members of the Council of Europe;. 13. Thirdly, I think we should do well in the Committee of Ministers tomake arrangements for setting up suitable intergovernmental bodies to examinethe majority of the recommendations which&apos; the Assembly has made. These inter-governmental Committees might meet at intervals at Strasbourg during the coming year for the purpose of investigating such matters as human rights, social security and so on, and their very existence should, I think, do something to discouragethe Assembly from insisting on the establishment of too many Committees on itsown account, and at the same time give it the impression that its recommendations are at any rate being taken seriously by the Governments concerned.New Accessions14. Since the Council of Europe is a focus for European co-operation, it follows that, if we are to implement our promise to incorporate Germany intothe Western system, she must sooner or later be admitted to the organisation. If,as it must, the United Kingdom is going to have to contract out of any closeeconomic union, one effect may be gradually to diminish the attraction which a western orientation would otherwise have for Germany. It is therefore important that the German Federal Republic.should be brought in at the earliestpossible date with our support and encouragement, so that the process of, recon-ciliation between France and Germany, so essential for the building up of Europe,may be begun with our sponsorship and within this wide European framework:The experience of this year shows that the delegations in the Assembly tendnaturally to divide on party, and other special lines and not to form national blocs.This makes the Assembly a particularly suitable forum for the Germans to make their debut in European association. There is at present a strong desire in^Western Germany to join, and it would be most unfortunate if this were allowedto dissipate. Moreover, both we and the French have declared that one of theprincipal adavantages of the Council of Europe is that it will permit of german participation.15. If Germany is to join at all she could either join as an Associate Member,under Article 5 of the Statute (i.e., with seats in the Assembly), or as a full Member.I do not think that in present circumstances there could really berany question of &apos;[Germany joining as a full Member, She does not as yet control her own foreignpolicy, though of course she will do so to an increasing degree as time goes on.Moreover, I have information to the effect that at the moment the, German Chan-jcellor would be perfectly happy if Germany were invited to join as an AssociateMember.   In any case, whatever reasons there may be for suggesting that Germany
should join as a full Member, it is extremely improbable that the French would agree to any such thing. Indeed we may well have difficulties with the french as regards Germany&apos;s admission as an Associate Member., As against this itmust be recognised that the longer a decision to invite Germany as an AssociateMember is postponed the greater the clamour in some quarters will become for heradmission as a full Member;16. Though this is not mentioned specifically in any Assembly resolution or recommendation, the fact remains that the Assembly thought that if the Committeeof Ministers admitted Germany as an Associate Member this year it would be highly desirable to have a Special Session of the Assembly in March or April of next year so that Germany (who would be debarred from attending the Committeeof Ministers) would at any rate be able to take a definite part in the Council ofEurope at a fairly early date. It was also thought that certain other mattersmight be dealt with at this Special Session. I am, however, myself opposed tothe idea of a Special Session of the Assembly in the spring for reasons which Ithink my colleagues will readily appreciate.17. A final difficulty as regards Germany is that it may well be that theFrench will only agree to Germany being invited to join as an Associate Memberif a similar invitation is offered at the same time to the Saar. Provided, however,that we are successful in inducing the French to say that, just as in the case ofGermany, they Would have no objection to the Saar eventually joining as a full member, I should be disposed to agree to this proposal. For if the Saar evershould join as a full Member, it will be clear that as an independent State it wouldpossess the inherent right of eventually choosing between remaining independent,or, alternatively, joining up with either Germany or France. If this position weremade clear to the Germans, they for their part should not raise any objection tothe Saar joining the Council of Europe as an Associate Member. Much, however,will clearly depend on the attitude of the French.. 18. As regards new admissions generally, therefore, I believe that we should endeavour to get the Committee of Ministers to agree as follows : (1) To make a declaration that if the German Federal Republic desires to accede as an Associate Member of the Council of Europe and is pre-pared to subscribe to the provisions of Article 3 of the Statute, theGovernments concerned will at once issue an invitation to it underArticle 5.(2) To make a similar declaration in respect of the Saar on the assumptionthat such action would be necessary in order to induce the FrenchGovernment to agree to (1). (The position of Austria cannot, bedecided until the fate of the Peace Treaty negotiations is more clear.)E. B.Foreign Office,S^th, October, 1949.
ANNEX - ^ &apos;   (Summary-of Main Conclusions from Departmental Briefs on AssemblesRecommendations And ResolutionsA. Recommendations and Resolutions of the Assembly on General. &apos; Affairs; and b General Questions in the Covering Letter of 9th September fromthe President of the Consultative Assembly not covered byParts II-VIH below.I. Recommendations to the Committee of ministers. Amendments to the Statute &apos;&apos;(a) Amendment to Articles 4 and 5 to confer on the. Assembly a right of veto on the admission of new Members and new Associate Members ofthe Council.On the face of it this may seem reasonable, but it is dangerous as suggesting that-the Assembly has a jurisdiction in foreign affairs. This amendment should therefore not be adopted.(b) Amendment to Article 23 to permit the Assembly to settle its ownAgenda.       : txT The Assembly is likely in practice to discuss anything it likes, and theCommittee of Ministers will find it increasingly difficult to exercise this control.i Since the revised wording, by mentioning the aim and scope of the Council, as defined in Chapter I of the Statute, excludes the discussion of Defence matters,\ this amendment may be adopted.(c) Amendments to Articles 25 and 26- to cancel the provisions for Substitutesand to double the number of representatives in the Assembly.The membership of the Assembly should be increased as a price for theabolition of Substitutes, but an increase of 100 per cent, is unnecessarily great.If any lesser increase is to be made, it seems to be a choice between a rough increaseof 25 per cent, or one of 50 per cent, in individual and general representation(Luxembourg remaining in any case at 3); and in view of the greater ease withwhich the existing proportions (particularly as regards the smaller Powers) couldthereby be preserved it is recommended that the second alternative be preferredand that the Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies be instructed&quot; to work out a schemeaccordingly; &quot; &apos; v. u^v- . &apos;(d) Amendment to Articles 36 and 37 to provide for a second Deputy Secre-tary-General for the Assembly.The principle of an additional Deputy Secretary-General should be accepted,but he must be responsible, not to the Assembly but for the Assembly. He and theIDeputy Secretary-General for the Committee of Ministers should be responsible to the Secretary-General, who could be made responsible to the-, Council as awhole, if necessary taking his Oath before the Assembly as well! as before theCommittee of Ministers. If this compromise is approved in the Committee ofMinisters it should be referred to the Secretariat or the Foreign Ministers&apos;Deputies for the drafting of the necessary amendment to the Statute. Thequestion of the personalities involved should be held over for later discussion inthe light of this report. - ..(e) Amendment to Article 41 (d) to permit the provision for the AmendmentI without ratification of Articles 23 to 35, 38 and 39, to come into force immediately instead of only at the conclusion of the Second OrdinaryI Session of the Assembly. .This amendment should be adopted.
(/) Consequential Amendments to Articles 24, 29, 31 and 34.These may not all be necessary in the light of the decision by the Committeeof Ministers on the proposed amendments at (a), (b), (c), (d) and -(e) above, andthere.may be others. This question should therefpre be referred to the Secretariator the Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies to submit recommendations.2. Assembly^ Recommendation that before the next Ordinary or ExtraordinarySession the Committee of. Ministers should consider the question of newadmissions. : -This matter should be considered in accordance with the Assembly&apos;s wishesand the lines on which the Foreign Secretary might speak are discussed in thecovering paper.II. Resolutions of the Assembly1. Establishment of the Standing Committee(a) This Resolution for internal action by the Assembly should be noted, andho exception need be taken to the Committees terms of reference,although the proposal &quot; to create a European Political authority with limited functions but real powers &quot; ought perhaps to have been referred to the General Affairs Commitee (see below) as being more appropriate to that body. This is, however, a matter for the Assembly,and possibly M. Spaak may have wished to have this problem.under his own supervision in the Standing Committee. Additional financeshould be provided for this Committee&apos;s activities.(b) The Standing. Committee is to meet immediately after the Committee ofMinisters. In order to enable it to carry out its terms of referencea fairly full report of the action of the Committee: of Ministers willhave to be available for it. The necessity for this report does not mean,however, that the Committee of Ministers must take firm decisionsnow on all the recommendations of the Consultative Assembly.Provided that it is fairly full, the communique&quot; issued at the end ofthe Committee of Ministers&apos; Meeting should serve the purpose, inaddition to the consultations which will doubtless take place betweenthe Committee of Ministers and M. Spaak, as President of theAssembly and Chairman of the Standing Committee.2. Continuation of the Work of the General Affairs committee this Resolution for internal action by the Assembly should be noted,v andno exception need be taken to the Committee&apos;s terms of reference. Additionalfinance should be provided for its activities. It is, however, undesirable that; theCommittee should have the right &quot; to obtain the assistance of experts &quot; withoutfurther definition; perhaps the Committee of Ministers could suggest that theStanding Committee should add the words &quot;provided that the Authorities towhom the experts are responsible concur.&quot;3. Continuation of the Work of the other Committees of thet assembly the various Resolutions of the Assembly have provided that its already existing Committees should meet in the interval between Sessions to continuethe study of the questions referred to them, by the Assembly. Their meetingswill be regulated by the Standing &quot;Committee, but this Committee will have no control over their work. The only control which the Committee of Ministers hasover the establishment of these Committees is that they must approve any requests for expenditure exceeding the amount already allocated in the budget for theAssembly and its activities. To veto the continuance of these Committees betweenSessions purely on economy grounds, would, however, be undesirable. On theother hand, it is probable that their work, although at a non-governmental level,will overlap seriously with that of existing organisations. This argument, par-ticularly if taken in conjunction with a decision by the Committee of ministers to set up sub-committees to study the various Resolutions of the Assembly, might make the Assembly more ready to accept a decision that only the StandingCommittee, the General Affairs Committee and the Committee of Rules olProcedure, should meet between Sessions.
Recommendations of the Assembly on Cultural, and Scientific AffairsGeneral ,   .       , .;&apos;/&apos;:::.&apos; f. ,(1) For practical reasons many of the proposed activities can be better done,and are already being done,&apos; on a smaller,1 e.g., live-Power (Brussels Treaty), basisthan on a twelve-Power basis, or in a number of cases on a bilateral basis (CulturalConventions). U.N.E.S.C.O. is already handling many of those that are suitablefor international treatment- The Council of Europe: should, not undertake; whatis already being done,vor-can be better done in a smaller field, and by duplicationwaste money and trained man-power (which in many countries is not numerousfor cultural and scientific purposes). It should devote its first attention to havingthose things segregated that can mpst suitably be done on a twelveTPower basis.(2) The proposal for a European Cultural Centre raises all the considerations in&apos;(1) above, and the&quot;;establishment of this Centre should be resisted, There is no suggestion as to how it would be financed, or how it would be co-ordinated withthe machinery of the Council of Europe, and it would be superfluous.:(3) The Council of Europe will, however, heed some machinery, and the setting up, under the Committee of Ministers, of a committee of Cultural and&apos;::Scientific Advisers (or possibly separate Committees for culture and science) isI recommended.&apos;; The Treasury are anxious to avoid anything costly, particularly of a recurrent nature, and this Committee is proposed first of all on an ad hoc\ basis, v&apos; This Committee might prove less costly, as a continuing institution to[advise the Committee of Ministers and harmonise the Council of Europe&apos;s activitieswith those of U.N.E.S.C.O., than the European Cultural Centre.   This Committeewould advise on the necessity or otherwise of a counterpart on the Assembly side,and would draw up the &quot;European plan for cultural co-operation &apos;&apos; (paragraph below). &apos;v;&apos;;&quot;-;-V:-:      &apos;.: v.Particular Recommendations of the Assembly &apos;   &apos;&apos;1 t(4); Recommendations concerning a System of Cultural Conventions.This can be accepted. -     &apos;37745 C.... ., Additional^ .fmance should, therefore,c;not fb,e provided for the work  between now and ihe: next Sessionof any of t e,Ass^Committee, the General Affairs Committee and the Committee, of Rule,s of&apos;Procedure.

It is not anticipated that there will be anysubstantial new development in the near future, but we are open to consider any proposals, which our economic position will allow, that may be made withinthe framework of the Council of Europe.2.   Ratification of International ConventionsThe United Kingdom has ratified nearly all the I.L.O. Conventions on social insurance. They are, however, about to he revised and the present does not appearto be an appropriate moment to press the members of the Council of Europe to ratify them.3.   Reciprocal arrangements(i) In Great Britain none of the new social security schemes (apart fromfamily allowances) take any account of nationality. There are threereciprocity agreements with the Irish Republic and one with France,and similar arrangements are under negotiation with the Netherlands,Belgium and Luxembourg. Within the framework of the brussels treaty we are preparing multilateral agreements on social insurance and financial and medical assistance.
U   -. (ii) Experience of negotiating bilateral agreements under the Brussels Treatysuggests that we might explore the possibility of making similar agree-ments&apos;with the members of the Council of Europe. This&apos;might leadultimately to the conclusion of a multilateral agreement.    -(iii) The problems involved are highly technical and Unsuitable forconsidera-tion by the Committee on Social Questions of the Assembly. (this in any case runs counter to our general policy, that only thePermanent Committee, the General Affairs Committee and t*be Com-mittee on Rules of Procedure and Privilege .should meet betweensessions of the Assembly). If the Committee of Ministers decide that1 the question needs further consideration they may wish to refer itto a sub-committee of experts, who should have an opportunity ofstudying the agreement, negotiated under the Brussels Treaty.II. housing. The Housing Sub-Committee of the Industry and Materials Committee ofthe Economic Commission for Europe (E:C.E.) has done a good deal of work onthe exchange between European countries of technical information in regard to housing. This should not be duplicated; instead,1 arrangements should be made tohave information secured or prepared by the Housing Sub-Committee madeavailable to the Council of Europe. ;;2. The questions of interchanging information concerning the proportion&apos;of personal income devoted to housing, and the methods of control of housing and building societies, have not been.dealt with by E.C.E. It might be difficult torefer this question for study to the E.C.E. Housing Sub-Committee&apos;s working party on Programmes and Resources, as E.C.E. is United Nations body (althoughthe Soviet Union does not take part and few of her satellites show a keen interest).But the Working Party of the Committee of Ministers referred to at 3 belowmight be instructed to explore the possibility of this or alternatively making the study themselves.3. The remaining proposals made by the Consultative Assembly (studies of conditions prevailing in low-cost housing and of the part played by social security organisations on improving policies) are outside the purview of theHousing Sub-Committee of E.C.E. They could be considered by a working party of experts who would report to the Committee of Ministers.j III. Emigration ,Equality of social rights between national and emigrant workersIn the United Kingdom there is no discrimination between foreign and national workers over a wide field of social rights. There are certain limitationsin regard to social security (see I above). If the reference to social rights isintended to cover complete freedom of choice of employment on entry we could not accept this absolutely.Study of problem of Emigration by Committee oh Social questions the proposal that the Assembly^ Committee for Social Questions should undertake a &quot; complete study of the problem &quot; would inevitably cause duplicationand would run counter to His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;^ policy of discouragingCommittees of the Assembly (with certain exceptions) from continuing to sit whenthe Assembly is not in session. It is proposed that the Committee of ministers should instead set up an official working party to review what is,being donealready and consider whether there is any action which the Council can usefullytake.Ratification of I.L.O. Convention on Migration for Employment of July 1949Although His Majesty ^Government in the United Kingdom are generallysympathetic to the objects of the Convention, no. decision has yet been taken as to ratification. - No other State has yet ratified, and the time-limit for ratificationdoes not expire until July 1950 (or; in exceptional circumstances, January 1951).All that appears1 to be required at present is that the members States should be urged to consider without delay whether they can ratify the Convention.37745 jjf
Recommendations for action by the Foreign Secretary on Social Security, housing and EmigrationThe Foreign Secretary should therefore: (a) Suggest the establishment of three sub-committees of experts to considerthe recommendations of the Assembly in these three spheres, takingparticular account of the work already being done an existing inter-governmental organisations and bearing in mind that E.C.E. maynot be prepared to co-operate actively with the Council of Europe,beyond making available information already compiled, and to makea report to the Committee of Ministers.(&amp;) Refuse, pending this study of what is already being done, the additionalfinance for the Social Committee of the Assembly to&apos; work betweensessions.IVResolutions on Procedure and Privilege1. Resolution for the establishment of Sub-Committee to continue compila-tion of Rules of Procedure for Assembly.2.   Resolution on Motions regarding possible breach&apos;of privilege.These are Assembly matters and no action is required by the Committee ofMinisters. The Resolutions can be noted and no objection heed be taken to them.The necessary finance should be provided for this Committee to work betweensessions of the Assembly.Human Rights(1) The Foreign Secretary should accept in principle that a Convention shouldbe drawn up.(2) Subject to paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 below, the Committee of ministers should, if possible, be discouraged from attempting at this stage to deal with thesubstance of the recommendations submitted by the Consultative Assembly, but should confine themselves to setting up a body to study them and report back tothe Committee. In particular they should not give any directions implying thatthe convention should contain all the rights proposed by the Assembly or that itshould contain these rights only. -&quot;&apos; They should leave the expert body as free ahand as possible.(3) This body set up to draft the convention should,consist of one fullyaccredited and responsible representative of each Government, who should when-ever possible be a legal expert.(4) Article 3 (Free elections and toleration of opposition activities) shouldnot be included in the Human Rights convention but in a separate instrument.(5) The proposals for enforcement of the convention by means of a Corn-mission and Court of Human Rights should not be referred to the body set up to draft the convention at this stage. The question of enforcement can only beappropriately considered when sufficient agreement has been reached on the fulldefinition of the rights to be safeguarded and their conditions and limitations.The body appointed to draft the convention should report the results of its workon the first stage with a view to receiving further directions from the Committeeon the question of the appropriate means of enforcement.(6) The Foreign Secretary should, if possible, refrain at the present stagefrom taking up a position on the application of the convention to colonial territories.
I 13VIRecommendation for the Establishment of a European Patent office as a result of preliminary studies we see no great advantage in the Assembly &apos;proposal to establish a European Search Office, from which the United Kingdomincidentally is unlikely to derive any benefit. Moreover, the ConsultativejAssembly&apos;s draft is inadequate. Nevertheless, we ought to be co-operative in thispiatter.It is&apos; therefore recommended that the Foreign Secretary should suggestthat this matter be referred for consideration to a body of technical experts, who should try to produce a workable and economical scheme, and that this study could best take place in O.E.E.C., since it is important that Germany should(participate in it.VIIrecommendation regarding a european passport, and resolution regardingEuropean Nationality1.   Recommendation that the question of a European passport should betudied by each Member State&apos;s appropriate department.It may be that, if this recommendation is seriously pressed; we shall havefto agree to it, but it is, however, clear that the problem is largely an abstract oneImtil progress has been made towards a common European nationality.2.   Resolution that the Standing Committee or any other Committee shouldonsider the question of a common European nationality.This is an Assembly matter and can be noted.   Since we wish to restrictR^ssembly Committees between Sessions, the Standing Committee should be toldBhat no extra finance would be provided for any Committee to study this matter$her than the Standing Committee itself.  Alternatively, since progress on thisuestion must be made before much progress can be made about a EuropeanJpassport, the Committee of Ministers might like to set up a Working Party toonsider on a governmental level what progress can be made on this question ofRationality laws, the Standing Committee of the Assembly being told that theres therefore no need for them to undertake the task.VIIIB&amp;.ssembly&apos;s Resolution that the Secretary-General be asked to Study andReport on the Problem of RefugeesThis is an Assembly matter and the Committee of Ministers need perhaps doSpoi more than take note of the resolution.   But, on the other hand, the problem isj?eing handled with great competence by the International Refugee Organisation,pid it would seem to be a waste of time, and perhaps of money, for the Assemblycause the Secretariat to undertake the study proposed.

(1+9)  20520TH OCTOBERT  1 QiiQCABINETNo.   3 (REDUCTION OF INVESTMENT PROGRAMME AMDGOVERNMENT expenditure memorandum by the Prime minister the Economic Policy Committee have considered at aseries of meetings the memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer on the internal financial situation (E. P. 0.(2+9) 102and 1fo) and on measures to combat inflation (E. P. 0.(2+9) 111).2. The Committee accept as a general diagnosis of thesituation that if we are to take advantage of the opportunitiescreated by re-valuation to expand our exports to hard currencymarkets, we must, alongside positive measures to increase productivity and production, take steps to secure that our .efforts are not frustrated by the pull of the home market.     Tothis end, we must- secure that the increase of inflationary prosuro which there has boon in recent months, arising in partfren increased pjpivate spending and in part from the&quot; growth ofGovernment expenditure&quot;&apos;beyond the budget &quot;estimates, and thefurther increase which will follow diversion of goods to export markets with a consequent diminution in the goods available fortho home market without diminution of jxirsonal incomes, arecorrected by appropriate disinflationary measures at home.3. It is not practicable at the present stage to attemptany precise quantification of the extent of this inflation.The time for such, estimates will be in the spring in prepara-tion for next year&apos;s budget, in which it will be possible toconsider all the measures of a budgetary character which willbe required to meet the situation created by re-valuation asit will then be developing.      It is, hoy/ever, clear thatsignificant contributions to these measures will have to besecured in the form of reductions of the capital investment programme to bring it into line with the savings likely to boavailable to meet it and reductions of Government expenditure to secure a true budget surplus of the amount we require.      Itis equally clear that if measures in these respects, are to be-in operation in time to have a significant effect on nextyear&apos;s budget, they must be started forthwith.k* The judgment of the Economic Policy Committee,after prolonged discussion of the situation, is that we should introduce measures designed to secure as soon as possible economies of between  250 and  300 millions, as compared withthe forecasts under current policies and rates of expenditure,and that this sum should be roughly divided between capital investment and Government expenditure.      But in view of the inevitable uncertainty of&apos;the factors from which this judgmentis formed, the sum aimed at can only be regarded as a guide tothe Cabinet of the magnitude of the measures required.      Presen-tation to Parliament of our conclusions will be on broaderlines without mention of any specific target.
