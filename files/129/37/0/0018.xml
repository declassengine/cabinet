CABINETLiABItiTY, TO MILitARY sMviCE OF INDIAN CITIZENSRESIDENT IN  HE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and the MiNfsTER of Labour and national service. At their Meeting on 29th August (CM. (49) 54th Conclusions. Minute 4)the Cabinet, \Vheri Considering the pMpbsed consequential legislation to deal withthe jposition of Iiidia as a Republic within the Commonwealth, invited theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, in Consultation with the LawOfficers, to submit a memorandum on the liability to military service of Indiancitizens resident in the United Kingdom. The views of the Law Officers on thelegal aspects are given in paragraph 9.The Existing Position2. Under the National Service Act, 1948, male British subjects ordinarily resident in Great Britain are liable to be called tip for service in the Armed ForcesOf the Crowri. The Act provides that men are riot ordinarily resident if they areresident here, only for the purpose of attending a course of education or otherwisefor a temporary purpose only; or if, being men who are either nationals or citizens!of a Commonwealth country or Who were born or are domiciled in any part ofHis Majesty&apos;s dominions outside Great Britain, they have been resident here forless&apos;than two years., There is also an exemption for men who are here solely inthe service of their Government.3. The powers of conscription under the existing National Service Act atpresent apply to men between i8 and 26. It may be noted that the great majorityof Indian citizens between the relevant ages who are resident in this country arelikely to be able to show that they are resident here for a temporary purpose orfor the purpose of education. A draft of a National Service Bill to be enacted in the event of an emergency is now in i preparation and is based on the aboveprinciples.4. The then existing Commonwealth Gpvernments were informed in 1939(in connection with, the Militar-y Training Bill) that our conscription legislation would apply to British subjects ordinarily resident here, and the definition of ordinary residence now in use includes,amendments suggested by South Africa.But at ho stage have other Commonwealth Governments been asked to give or given their positive assent to the relevant provisions.The Position in regard to Indians5. If the legislation approved in principle by the Cabinet on 29th Augustis passed, all existing United Kingdom law, including the National Service Act,1948, will continue to apply to Indian citizens* as, if they were British subjects and they will therefore be liable for military service, though the great majorityan citizens between the, relevant ages, are likely to be exempt, as beingresident here for a temporary purpose or for the purpose of education.   &apos;The, J &apos;*.&amp;&apos;* Indian eonstitufiditf provides that Indians resident outside India may opt to be citizens ofinaia it any of their parents or grandparents were born in India.37792 this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENT *  jPrinted for the Cabinet.

Commonwealth Relations Office consider that, in view of the general attitude ofthe Government of India in foreign policy (which is one of no entanglements) andof their strong dislike of our policy in Malaya, where United Kingdom troops areat present actively employed, it is unlikely that the Government of India willt acquiesce in the conscription of Indian citizens into the United Kingdom forces.j Their objection may well be one of principle that it is inconsistent with theirdignity as a fully independent State that their citizens should be liable to con-scription by another country. Certainly they are likely to resist any such proposalunless it is put on a reciprocal footing and United Kingdom citizens in India aremade liable to conscription in India, &quot;it is unlikely, of course, that they willresort to conscription in India for military service in time of peace. Conscriptionby the Government of India in the event of India being at war (which might be some form of local hostilities not affecting other parts of the world) is a seriouspossibility. The conscription of Europeans into the ranks of the Indian forces under Indian conditions of climate, diet and hygiene and on Indian rates of pay would be an intolerable hardship for those concerned. Any arrangement basedon genuine reciprocity involving an actual call-up would seem therefore to be outof the question in relation to India, and, by implication, to Pakistan and Ceylon.The Position as regards the Irish Republic6. In considering the conscription of Indian citizens, it is necessary tobear in mind the decisions recently reached and announced in regard to citizens of the Irish Republic. Ministers stated in Parliament (see, in particular, the replygiven by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations on 26th Novem-ber, 1948 (Hansard, column 1590)) that citizens of Eire would have under theBritish Nationality Act, 1948, the rights of British subjects under our statute law and that those who were habitually resident in this country would be liable for military service. In the House of Lords on 15th December, 1948 (Hansard,columns 1122-3), the Lord Chancellor said that the position of Eire citizens inrelation to war-time conscription would depend upon the conscription law; thatIrish Republicans could be called up under the existing National Service Act; andtha,t that would continue. When asked if it was the case that there was no intention of altering this position, the Lord Chancellor kept the position openby saying that various amendments of the law might have to be considered. TheLord Privy Seal, in reply to a question by Lord Simon on 8th February, 1949(Hansard, columns 176-7), said that, by virtue of Section 3 (2) of the british nationality Act, the National Service Acts would continue, as now, to apply tocitizens of Eire who were ordinarily resident in Great Britain. The PrimeMinister reiterated this in moving the second reading of the Ireland Bill(Hansard for 11th May, 1949, column 1865), and. the point was several timesmade in the debate that if Irish Republican citizens were to receive the benefits of being treated as if they were British subjects they must also assume theobligations.7. This position has, however, never been accepted formally by the irish republican Government. Mr. Costello, in reply to a question in the Dail on15th December, 1948, stated that Irish citizens were liable under the existingUnited Kingdom National Service Act, but if they did not wish to serve in theBritish Forces they might return to Ireland. He then said that this position had been the subject of protests by the Irish Republican Government, that a new situation would arise on 1st January, 1949, when Irish citizens would no longer be British subjects under the law of Great Britain, and that no doubt this change would in due course be reflected in British legislation dealing with conscription.He did not suppose that in future the British Government would seek to imposecompulsory military obligations on Irish Republican citizens resident in GreatBritain other than those who had chosen the status of British subject or UnitedKingdom citizen.8. The working party of officials which examined questions arisin  inconnection with the Ireland Bill pointed out that, notwithstanding Mr. Costello views, it was desirable that, as a theoretical measure, conscription ot irisnRepublican citizens should continue as it would provide a useful argument inthe International Court in support of the policy that the. Irish Republic is not&quot; foreign &quot; to the United Kingdom.   In practice it was unlikely to give rise w
any difficulty because those who objected to being conscripted could return to theIrish Republic. These recommendations of the working party were approved bythe Cabinet on 12th January, 1948 (CM. (49) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2).Legal and Constitutional Considerations :(This paragraph states the views of the Law Officers.)9. From the purely legal point of view the effect of the draft India(Consequential Provisions) Bill is that the liability of Indian citizens to militaryservice is preserved without their being British subjects (although they of course-remain Commonwealth citizens). This liability may, however, be removed from them by Order-in-Council (under Clause 2 (4) of the Bill). An analysis of theprovisions of the Bill in relation to the liability of Indian citizens to compulsory military service is contained in the Annex to tnis paper.A not dissimilar question might arise in the case of Indian citizens as arose in the case of citizens of the Irish Republic, namely, whether it would be in accord with international comity for Indian citizens to be conscripted in this countryotherwise than in pressing emergency, except with the agreement of India. \Thesituation of an Indian Republic not owing any common allegiance to the Crownyet within the ambit of the Commonwealth is one for which it is difficult to find any precedent in international law. India, however, must probably be treated for this purpose, vis-a-vis the United Kingdom, as an independent sovereigncommunity and the bond of common membership of the Commonwealth would not,it is submitted, give either the United Kingdom or India any rights in the matterof conscripting the citizens of the other without consent which it would not haveagainst a foreign Power. If this is right it would seem not to be in accord withthe principles of international comity for Indian citizens to be conscripted in theUnited Kingdom except with the consent of India, and vice versa.At the same time, if only so long as India remains a member of the Common-wealth and tacitly or otherwise is party to the arrangement whereby under Englishmunicipal law Indian citizens are not treated as aliens in this country, india would presumably be taken to have agreed to her citizens being subjected to the liabilities incumbent on citizens of this country. Such consent could, however,be withdrawn at any time by India, and if it were withdrawn it would seem, ifthe above statements are correct, that from that time onwards her citizens could not longer be conscripted consistently with the observance of international comity.The -Problem for Solution10. We may therefore have to face a refusal by the Government of Indiato agree to conscription of Indian citizens. It is very unlikely that they willoverlook this question. If so, Indian citizens would very probably have to be exempted by legislation. If this is done, it will be still more difficult to maintainconscription of Irish Republican citizens. It is, however, clearly most diffcultto discontinue it, because the number of Irish Republican citizens working inthis country is so large that great ill-feeling will be caused if they are exempt.In peace-time the Indian problem is of very small dimensions, but the Ministerof Labour and National Service is not able to give an assurance that in all casesIndian citizens will qualify for exemption under the provisions of the Actsummarised in paragraph 2 above. Cases are bound to arise in which the Ministryof Labour will be bound to call up Indians, though these will be insignificantin numbers. The Ministry of Labour are prepared to apply to Indians the samearrangement which they apply to citizens of the Irish Republic, namely, to give:them the option of leaving this country instead of being called up.Proposals11. It is clear that no solution is to be found by the exemption of Indiancitizens only. This would make the continued conscription of Irish Republicansmost difficult and might well result in protests from Pakistan, and possibly ceylon and bouth Africa, against the grant of special privileges to Indians. If Indiansare to be exempted the only logical solution is to make the liability for militaryservice apply to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies instead of toBritish subjects. This would exempt all citizens of Commonwealth countries and (contrary to the recently declared policy) citizens of the Irish Republic,ine Minister of Labour considers that it would cause much discontent if personswno enjoy the full rights of United Kingdom citizens in this country escape theirmam liability, and he is, therefore, strongly opposed to this solution.37792 g 2
12. The Lord Privy Seal considers that,, having regard to the; international status now attained by other Commonwealth countries, to the, fact that the bestopinion in international law is that the conscription of citizens of a foreign country is contrary to the comity of nations, and to the new citizenship legislation in ^the Commonwealth, it &quot;will become impossible to continue to conscript the citizens of other Commonwealth countries without the consent of the. Governmentsof those countries. He considers that, if any Commonwealth country were to object to the application of the existing National Service Act to their citizens,there would be no alternative but to exempt them. This would be necessaryboth in. the interests of our relations with that country and because, in the face ofobjections, we could not treat Member States of the Commonwealth less favourablythan we consider ourselves bound by international law to treat foreign countriesIf, however, consents were sought at the present time the Government of theIrish Republic and the Government of India would certainly refuse and the$outh African Government would probably do so also. This might lead to otherrefusals.13. In view of the difficulties seen by the Minister of Labour to the exemption of anyone who enjoys the privileges of a United Kingdom citizen, theonly alterna-tive; course is to endeavour to. seeum ail: understanding: with; the,, Government ofIndia. To have any chance of success such an approach would have to be confined to peace-time conscription under the: existing; Act, and be accompanied by an assurance that only an insignificant number of cases in: which Indian citizenshave to be conscripted will arise in practice, and that alii these persons will be;given the option to leave this, country. It will also be necessary to say that conscription for military service will not be applied to Indian citizens in time ofwar without further consultation, with the Government of India. If the Govern-ment of India say that they must have a reciprocal right to conscript: UnitedKingdom citizens in India, we should, say that we concede the right in; time ofpeace on the understanding that the age groups and the basis of exemption wouldbe the same as in this country and that, in any cases in which a liability is enforced,the person in question will be permitted to leave India and be given reasonable time in which to do so. It is conceivable that the Government of India willacquiesce in an arrangement on this basis and not make an issue of principle ofthe matter, in which case the difficulties about the Irish Republic can be avoided.Lfy as a consequence of making this arrangement with India, any other Common-wealth Government demanded a similar arrangement, it would have to be conceded.14. But the position is essentially different in regard to war-time conscription.In war-time the number of persons liable to military service is much greater andthere is.no doubt: that a. considerable number of Indian, citizens,would becomeliable. This happened,in the last war. It would probably be impracticable toreturn all these people to India; Moreover; the, Government, of Tndia...would, have much stronger objections to their citizens being conscripted if or: war service, at anyrate unless they, were in accord with us in the particular circumstances. Theyare, therefore, very unlikely to accept conscription of their citizens in time of warin advance, of the particular; situation arising. Such consent, may be :more readilyforthcoming from some countries (and-particularly the Irish Republic) in.time ofwar, both because of the force of circumstances and-because itmight be possiblein the case of any Commonwealth country which. declined to j have its citizensconscripted into the military forces to secure its agreement to their conscriptioninto non-combatant forces or their subjection to direction as totheir civil employ-ment. The Lord Privy Seal therefore considers that it should! be accepted inprinciple now that: any legislation providing, for conscription in war-time of citizens of Commonwealth countries in this country will have to be based on theconsent of Commonwealth Governments, to be sought (subject, it may be, to ministerial review; at the time) when, war is considered imminent.15. If it proves possible to obtain an arrangement with the Government ofIndia on the lines indicated in paragraph 13 above, it will clearly be desirablethat it should not receive any publicity. If such an arrangement were maaepublic it would probably increase the difficulties of the Government of India in accepting it and it would certainly become necessary for them to lay great emphasis on the assurance that Indian citizens willhave the option to leave the Unlt^cKingdom if they are called up. This makes it very desirable that the matteshould not be raised in the debates on the proposed India (Consequential rivisions) Bill in Parliament.   The Lord Privy Seal would therefore propose tnat
. ANNEXAnalysis of Legal Position under India (Consequential Provisions) bill. Section 1 of the National Service Act, 1948, provides that British subjects&quot;ordinarily resident in Great Britain&quot; are to be liable to military service.Section 34 (4) of that Act provides that a person who is resident in Great britain is to be deemed &apos;&apos; ordinarily resident&apos;&apos; unless his residence is (1) for purposesof attending an educational course; (2) temporary; (3) in the case of a citizen of&quot; some part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions outside Great Britain,&quot; if he has been resident in Great Britain for less than two years.2.   Section 1 of the British Nationality Act, 1948, provides that a citizen of India shall have the status of a British subject, and may be known indifferentlyeither as a British subject or Commonwealth citizen.  Thus, the combined effectof these two Acts before India declared itself a Republic was that an IndianI citizen who was &apos;&apos; ordinarily resident&apos;&apos; in this country in the sense above described was clearly liable to military service.   When, however, India declareditself a Republic two questions arose :  (1) it was thought that Indians wouldprobably object to being known as British subjects as this would seem to involve an allegiance on their part to the Crown; (2) it was thought that it could no\ longer be said that India was &quot; part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions outside GreatBritain &quot; if India was not, then Indian citizens resident here would lose theI benefit of the exemption above referred to in favour of citizens &quot;of some part ofIHis Majesty&apos;s dominions outside Great Britain&quot; who had been resident hereI for less than two years.i      3.   The proposed Bill is designed inter alia to get over these difficulties, asI follows :^ Clause 1 says that Indian citizens are no longer to be &quot;british   subjects,&quot; but remain Commonwealth citizens.    This relieves them of theI semblance of owing allegiance to the Crown, but it would also, of course, takeI them outside the scope of Section 1 of the National Service Act, 1948, as they  would no longer be liable to military service, not being &quot;British subjects.&quot;Uause 2, however, brings them back within Section 1 of the National service act by saying m effect that, although Indian citizens are no longer Britishsubjects, existing law shall continue to apply to them as if they were and as ifIm in0t become a Republic.   The result of this is that Indian citizensU) are no longer to be known as British subjects; (2) are nevertheless liable toan approach should be made to the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses andto. other leading Opposition personalities who might raise the subject and toexplain to them the delicacy of the position.16. A decision on this matter is necessary now because the subject will haveto be dealt with in discussions with the Government of India on the proposed -consequential legislation about India. These are to be held with Sir G. Bajpai,who will be in the United States until late in November, but has agreed to cometo London for discussion of this subject in the second week of November. TheBill will have to be finalised and introduced immediately thereafter.17.   To sum up, it is proposed (1) To approach the Government of India during the consultations on theproposed India (Consequential Provisions) Bill for an arrangement on the lines indicated in paragraph 13 above.(2) That it be accepted that conscription for military service of citizens of commonwealth countries in war-time may have to be made dependentupon the consent of Commonwealth Governments, to be sought whenwar is imminent.(3) That, if the approach to the Government of India under (1) above fails,the matter should be brought up for further consideration.A.G. A. I.1st November, 1949.
military service; (3) (since the fact that India is a Republic is for this purpose to be disregarded) enjoy the exemption in favour of residents with less than two years&apos; residence. In substance, therefore, their liability to military service is preserved without, their being &quot;British subjects&quot; (although they of courseremain Commonwealth citizens). ,4. &quot;There is one further clause in the Bill to which attention should becalled, and that is Clause 2 (4),&quot; which enables His Majesty by Order-in-Council(subject to annulment by either House bf Parliament) to modify existing law&quot; as may appear to him to be necessary or expedient in view of India&apos;s becoming a Republic. This would enable Indian citizens to be relieved of liability to military service.. . 5, The ijegujl&apos; p^This/lj^l,$w^oe ia.thus to make Indian citizens liable to military service in the same, way as, Britisji subjects, aijthdugfi they are not themselves British subjects, and to enable this liability to be removed from themby Order-in-Council, if need be.
