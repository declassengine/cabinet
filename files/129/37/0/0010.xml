s DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1949SECRETCP. (49) 210 /19th October, 1949CABINETCopy No.    31lNNUAL REPORT  AND ACCOUNTS  OF  THE  OVERSEAS  food corporation, 1948-49  &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of food. I circulate for the information of my colleagues the text of the first annual report of the Overseas Food Corporation, which will be published very shortly,2. The document is in proof form and will be subject to minor amendments,j)ut no changes of substance will be made.3.   The report has been deliberately drafted so as to give a full and franklecount of the progress of the Groundnuts Scheme up to 31st March, 1949.   InIpite of the fact that I have already given the House all the essential informationirhich it contains, the report will come as a disappointment and a shock to manyjjeople who have based their hopes on the original estimates in the White PaperImd. 7030).   Thus it will be shown that during the first two years only a littleIver 46,000 acres had been cleared, while expenditure amounted to more than^21 million.   These compare with figures of 600,000 acres and  6 million giventhe original estimate.   The difficulties of gathering together equipment andransport troubles delayed the start, but the chief cause of the discrepancy has3en the fact that the task of bush clearing has proved much more difficult thanid been anticipated.  Techniques for dealing with the awkward rooting problemive had to be evolved and during the first year the cost per acre of clearinglork is reckoned to have been ten times the original estimate of  3 17s. 4rf. much the  21 million has been spent on buying experience which could be gainedno other way, but which is bound to appear a very expensively bought asset.4.   Nevertheless, I welcome the Corporation^ decision to publish a report; this form.   I am convinced that in no other way could the Corporation haveIcceeded in producing a document which will both tell the essential truth andike the scheme live for men and women who have never seen it.  And this isonly way to secure an understanding of the difficulties which inevitably facelast new project of this kind.5.   I do not propose to comment on the future of the scheme in thislorandum.   The publication of the Corporation^ Report and Accounts willI doubt give rise to a request for an early debate, but before that time I shallIpulate a separate memorandum on the future of the scheme, in the light ofIcussions which are now proceeding with the Treasury, the Colonial Office andI Board of the Corporation.  This will, I hope, enable us to take firm decisionsthe future and to deal effectively with criticisms which will be raised duringdebate. .J. S.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1,19th October, 1949.37729

CHAPTER 1HISTORY AND CONSTITUTIONOF THE O.F.C.1. The Overseas Food Corporation was established by the OverseasResources Development Act, 1948, which received the Royal Assent onFebruary 11, 1948.  The Corporation was charged with the duty of:  &quot;(a) securing the investigation, formulation, and carrying out of projects-for production or processing in places outside the United Kingdomof foodstuffs or agricultural products other than foodstuffs, andfor the marketing of foodstuffs or such products ; and(b) as the first project to be carried out by them, securing the large-scale production of groundnuts, together with crops rotationaltherewith or ancillary thereto, in Colonial territories in Eastand Central Africa, and the marketing thereof.&quot;2. More than a year before the Overseas Resources Development Act waspassed the Minister of Food announced in the&quot; House of Commons onNovember 25, 1946, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that thefirst year&apos;s work on the Scheme for the mechanised production of ground-nuts in East Africa should be launched on a limited commitment while thefull implications of the proposals were being examined by a special section inthe Ministry of Food in co-operation with the other Departments con-cerned. In order that the first year&apos;s work could be started immediately ithad been decided that the United Africa Company Limited should beentrusted with the initial stages of the venture. For this purpose a specialcompany was formed The United Africa Company (Managing Agency)Limited-and under its management the first year&apos;s operations were put in-Jiand.3. It has been the policy from the outset of the Scheme to carry outall land clearing and engineering works and building operations by contract.4. All agricultural operations are conducted directly by the Corporation.Broadly speaking, the Contractors clear the land and hand it over to theCorporation at a stage where agricultural operations can begin. It is atthis stage that the Contractors&apos; employees give place to the Corporation^,employees. .5. The work of the following major Contractors engaged is described ii*Appendix H:  Associated Drilling &amp; Supply Co. (Overseas) Ltd.Balfour Beatty &amp; Co. Ltd.Consolidated Petroleum Co. Ltd.Earthmoving &amp; Construction Ltd.John Mowlem &amp; Co. Ltd.Pauling &amp; Co. Ltd.George Stow &amp; Co. Ltd.Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd.6. While work was going forward in East Africa, invitations were being:issued to the men who were to become Members of the Board. Some ofthem were able to devote all their time to the affairs of the Corporation

before the organisation come formally into existence. It was possible forsome of them to study on the spot the progress which was being made in east Africa and to prepare gradually for the responsibilities which theywere to assume. Sir Leslie Plummer then Mr. L. A. Plummer (theChairman-Designate) and Major-GeneraJ. Desmond Harrison (the Resident.Member in East Africa-Designate) were able to visit East Africa in theautumn of 1947, and Mr. A. J. Wakefield (a Member-Designate of theCorporation) had been appointed Technical Adviser to the ManagingAgency.The Organisation of the Board7. The Board of the Corporation was formally appointed by the Ministerof Food on February 16, 1948, and March 1, 1948, was fixed as the date on which the responsibility of United Africa Co. (Managing Agency) Ltd.to the Ministry of Food for groundnut production in East Africa was to be-transferred to the Corporation. On March 31, 1948, the Corporation took,over the day-to-day direction of operations in East Africa.8. The Board consisted of a Chairman free from departmental responsibilities -ties, a Deputy-Chairman (with departmental responsibilities) and seven otherMembers. Of these four were full-time (with departmental responsibilities)-and three part-time Members.9. In East Africa, the Heads of Departments were responsible to the central management in East Africa and, through it, to the Board in London.10. For reasons which will emerge in a later section of this report (paras..138, 139), it was necessary in January, 1949, for the Chairman to assumetemporarily in East Africa the functions of the Resident Member and he was-joined later by three of the Executive Members of the Board. During thisperiod management decisions, in addition to decisions on policy and organisa-tion, were taken by the Board on the spot. The normal practice of theCorporation however reserves to the Board decisions on policy and the examination of the proposals, plans and budget estimates put forward bythe East African Management, while leaving to them full managerial respon-sibility for the execution of the directions which result from such examination.and policy decisions. It is considered unlikely that further occasions will,arise to vary this practice.11. The Executive Members, besides being in daily contact with each-other, met formally twice a week.12. The part-time Members, Lord Rothschild, Mr. Frank Samuel andSir Frank Stockdale, exercised no executive authority. The full Board ofMembers held 17 meetings during the year.Queensland-British Food Corporation.13. In January, 1948, Mr. Plummer and Mr. Wakefield, with an official of the Ministry of Food, visited Australia to examine the possibilities of undertaking there some schemes for the mechanised production of food.This visit resulted in a provisional agreement being reached with the Premierof Queensland, the Hon. E. M, Hanlon, Member of the Legislative Assembly,for a scheme for the large-scale production of sorghum and pigs for export to the United Kingdom. This proposal was approved by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in March, 1948, and the legislation was passed through theQueensland Parliament to set up the Queensland-British Food corporation to direct this project. The Act setting up this subsidiary of the Overseas-Food Corporation received the Royal Assent on April 2, 1948.

14. Mr. Plummer and Mr, Rosa are Chairman and Member respectivelyof the Queensland-British Food Corporation. It is their responsibility toreport to the Board of the Overseas Food Corporation oh the affairs of theQueensland-British Food Corporation. In this work they are aided by Mr.J. N. McClean, until 1948 Deputy ^President of the National Farmers&apos; Union,and now on the London staff of the Overseas Food Corporation. the overseas Food Corporation has two other representatives on the Board ofthe Queensland-British Food Corporation, which has a total of six members.15. The first Annual Report and Accounts of the Queensland-BritishFood Corporation are in Appendix I.Other Projects16. The White Paper on the Groundnuts Scheme (Cmd. 7030) recommendedthat Units should be developed, both in Kenya and in Northern Rhodesia.The Managing Agency investigated these possibilities in Kenya, and decided-against them.17. In the case of Northern Rhodesia, considerable exploratory work was undertaken by the Corporation in conjunction with the Northern rhodesia government. Proposals for a joint undertaking on a restricted scale weremade to that Government, but the Government was not prepared at that stage to undertake it.18. A number of proposals for other agricultural projects have beenreceived and examined by the Overseas Food Corporation during its first year,but no decision has been taken to extend its commitments beyond EastAfrica and Queensland.Relations with Government Bodies19. The Corporation has succeeded in maintaining a close and cordialrelationship with the Ministry of Food, the Colonial Office and with theother agencies of Government concerned with the development of its work.

CHAPTER 2EVENTS BEFORE O.F.C. took over THE GROUNDNUTSSCHEME20. The Overseas Food Corporation only became responsible for theconduct of the Groundnuts Scheme on March 1, 1948. It was not concernedwith the planning of the project nor with its development prior to that date;but since. April 1, 1948, it has been responsible for its execution and for any modifications to it. When the Corporation took over responsibility for theday-to-day direction of the Scheme in East Africa, work had already beenin progress there for over a year. A considerable amount of equipment hadbeen acquired, a staff had been assembled, the sites for development had been selected and a programme of work put in &quot;hand. These initial operations have influenced subsequent decisions in many important aspects. It will,therefore, be useful to outline the history of the Scheme and to give some indication of the decisions and preliminary work which had already formed the basis upon which the Corporation had to develop its organisation tocontinue the task its constitution required it to assume.World Food Shortage21. The conception of the Scheme centred on one of the most serious difficulties with which the Government was faced! at the end of the war the shortage&apos; of fats and animal feeding stuffs. Domestic consumers in theUnited Kingdom were rationed at 7 ozs. per head per week, and manu-facturers of many important foods were severely hampered by the limit totheir supplies. The situation was the more critical because this was not ashortage which time alone could be expected to remedy. There could be noquestion of waiting for the effects of war to disappear, and of returning then to the pre-war pattern of supply, for there were new factors to be taken intoaccount. The world population had increased since 1939, and was still in-creasing rapidly; in particular, India, which exported an average of 518,000tons of groundnuts a year between 1938 and 1945 to Europe, now wanted allshe could grow to feed her own people. In 1946 she exported to the UnitedKingdom 120,000 tons and in the following year only 12,000 tons. britain was importing 95 per cent, of the oils and fats (excluding butter) which sheused each year, and it was estimated in 1946 that the country was short ofwhat it needed by the equivalent of about one and a quarter million tons ofgroundnuts. Only some new source of supply could remedy this shortage,and it was not at all apparent where this new source of supply was to befound.Mr. SamueFs Plan22. These were the circumstances in which on March 28, 1946, Mr. FrankSamuel, Managing Director of the United Africa Company, presented to theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Food his plan for increasing the production of fats. He had noticed the potentialities of vasttracts of unoccupied virgin land in East Africa, and he was convinced that,by using modern mechanical methods of land-clearing and tillage, it would

be possible to bring into cultivation within a comparatively short time wide areas of land suitable for growing oilseeds. The crop which he favoured wasgroundnuts, partly because of its relatively high oil content and partly because,being an annual, it would yield returns quickly.23. Mr. Samuel&apos;s plan was to clear an area of 2,500,000 acres so that,after allowing for rotational cropping to preserve the land, 1,000,000 acrescould be kept under permanent cultivation. This, he estimated, would yieldabout 400,000 tons of shelled nuts or 160,000 tons of oil each year, The useof mechanical equipment would mean that a comparatively small labour force would be required-about 400 Europeans and 20,000 Africans wouldprobably be able to manage the whole area-and the capital cost of theScheme would be in the region of  8,000,000. The cost of production hadbeen assessed at  7 13s. 2d. per ton of shelled groundnuts f.o.r. Mr. Samuelbelieved that the plan could bring immense benefits both to the UnitedKingdom and to Tanganyika, but that if the project were to be carried forward on the scale and with the intensity necessary to make a contributionto the supplies of fat within a reasonable time, only the resources of Govern-fment would be adequate to launch and run it.The Wa&amp;eSeM Missions .24. The plan was received with profound interest, but the Governmentcould not commit itself to a scheme of this magnitude, involving as it must,very considerable risks, without full investigation, further technical advice and consultation with responsible officials on the spot. Accordingly, anOfficial Mission was sent out to East Africa under the auspices of theColonial Office, and under the leac1 ship of Mr. A. J. Wakefield, formerlyDirector of Agriculture in Tanganyika Territory, and more recently InspectorGeneral of Agriculture in the West Indies. With him were Mr. J. Rosa, ofthe Colonial Office, and Mr. D. L. Martin, head of the Plantation Depart-ment of the United Africa Company. The party left London on June 20,1946, and spent just over nine weeks in Africa, during which time they covered10,000 miles by air, and 3,000 miles by road and rail. On September 20,they presented their report Jo the Secretary of State for the Colonies. it contained the following recommendation:&quot; Now that we have seen for ourselves the great opportunities offered by East and Central Africa .. .. and have discussed the problems involved with the local Administrations and technical departments, we are ableconfidently to support the project, subject to minor modifications and torecommend its immediate adoption.&quot;25. The report went on to give the Mission&apos;s assessment of what could beachieved in terms of production and costs. Their advice was that the Govern-ment should aim at clearing 3,210,000 acres of bush by 1952 (2,400,000 acres of this in Tanganyika) a larger area than had been suggested by Mr.&apos; Samuel.This acreage could be expected to yield slightly over 600,000 torts of shellednuts a year. The aim should be to clear 150,000 acres in 1947 and a further450,000 acres in 1948. The full acreage cleared should be sown to ground-nuts in the autumn of each of the two years, so that a harvest of 56,920 tonscould be expected in 1948 and of 227,676 tons in 1949.26. Total capital expenditure for the entire Scheme wan estimated at 23,975,000 and the cost of clearing an acre of land at  3 17s. 4d. On thebasis of an average yield of 850 lbs. of shelled nuts per acre, the cost of pro-duction f.o.b. an African port, after allowing in full for amortisation, wasassessed at  14 5s. 6d.27. Labour requirements for clearing and planting the first 150,000 acres in 1947 were expected to be about 160 Europeans and 7,500 Africans.

Government Adoption, of the Scheme28. This was, in outline, the project to which Ministers were asked to give their approval. It was presented to them with the recommendation that&quot;for the establishment and operation of this project, the type of organisationnecessary is a corporation which, though entirely owned by H.M. Govern-ment, would be run on commercial lines and would enjoy the maximum possible freedom of action in the actual conduct of its affairs.&quot; The proposalsrepresented the best assessment which the three experts, who had been sent out to investigate possibilities, could at that time make on the basis of theevidence which they had collected. Ministers responsible examined them,discussed them with Colonial interests at home and overseas, and passed themfor detailed examination to officials. On November 25, two months afterthe Missions report had been presented/the Minister of Food informed theHouse of Commons that the Government had decided to proceed with.theScheme, to accept the Mission&apos;s proposed programme for 1947, but to delayany decision about the full scope of the plan until there had been more timeto consider it.The White Paper (Cmd. 7030)29. While operations for the first year were put in hand, a further and much more detailed examination of the plans for subsequent years was made.Ministers took the best advice available to them, and in February, 1947, their final decision was printed in the form of a White Paper entitled &quot; A Plan forthe Mechanised Production of Groundnuts in East and Central Africa&quot;(Cmd. 7030). The Governmenfs view contained in this document was that&quot; the Scheme is a practicable plan for alleviating the world shortage of fats,which is likely to last, for many years ; that it is agriculturally sound ; that,subject to reasonable assumptions, it involves no unjustifiable financial risk ;that labour difficulties can be overcome . . . and that it could prove of great benefit to the African populations as well as to the people of the UnitedKingdom.&quot; It went on to state that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have, there-fore, decided to proceed immediately with the development of approximatelythree and a quarter million acres of land in Tanganyika, Northern rhodesia and Kenya, on the general lines recommended by the Mission.&quot; The dangers of binding the Agency responsible for carrying out the work to the preciseplan recommended by the Mission were, however, foreseen, and it was made clear that the plan was to be subject to &quot; continuous review in the light of fresh information gathered as the work progresses.&quot; Indeed, it was not thought, impossible that the plan might have to be radically re-cast in thelight of experience. The risks involved were underlined, but so also was the government&apos;s conviction that these risks were worth taking because of thebenefits which the Scheme had to offer. At the time when the White paper was published, it was clear that there were difficulties in the way of procuring,overhauling and shipping sufficient tractors and mechanical transport in timefor 150,000 acres to be cleared for planting. But&apos;the advice given to theGovernment by those who had been engaged upon looking into possibilities,was that these difficulties might still be overcome, and, in any event, it was thought advisable to push ahead without loss of time so as to ensure theplanting of the maximum possible acreage of groundnuts in 1948, irrespective of the acreage planted in 1947.The Managing Agency Appointed30. The Government accepted the view that the most suitable body toundertake the management of a project of this kind was a Corporation ownedand financed by the Government.   But the establishment of such a body

would clearly take time, and in order that there should be no delay in launch-ing the Scheme, it was decided to proceed by means of agents responsible tothe Government. The obvious choice was the United Africa Company, be-cause it had been so intimately connected with the project from the start,and because of its experience with large-scale plantations in Africa, and so,on November 6, 1946, at the invitation of the Minister of Food, the United.Africa Company (Managing Agency) Ltd., took charge of the start of the enterprise. The plan was the plan contained in the report of the Mission,but which had been modified in certain respects by the Ministry of Food.Production costs re-assessed on rather less favourable assumptions aboutyield and prices, were now estimated at  17 18s. Od. per ton of shelled nutsf.o.b. an East African port, compared with the Mission&apos;s estimate of 14 5s. 6d. But with the price of groundnuts at around  40 per ton, this estimate presented an encouraging prospect. Moreover, the White Paperdrew attention to the serious situation with which the native population of africa were faced in maintaining even its existing meagre standard of livingunless some such project of large-scale development were initiated. Theplan could be expected to benefit both Africa and the United Kingdom alike.31. Immediately the Managing Agency was appointed, the task of obtaining the necessary equipment and securing the staff for the undertaking was putin hand. At the end of January, 1947, the advance party from the ManagingAsency and the Contractors arrived in Dar-es-Salaam and the work began.32. The original plan envisaged the clearing and planting of 150,000 acres in 1947-48, provided that the necessary machinery was available ori the site in February-March, 1947. Experience has shown that this target couldnot have been achieved in the first year of the Scheme, even if the equipmenthad been available. It may have been a possible target for the first year&apos;sclearing operations, on the assumption that before the clearing was started all.the necessary engineering facilities for the maintenance and supply of themechanised equipment had been provided, and that all the constructionalwork to provide homes, stores, and all the other provisions of a base forsuch a mechanised agricultural operation had been completed. Without anyof these facilities, and with only inadequate supplies of second-hand equip-ment, it soon became apparent that the targets could not be reached. Therewere also technical obstacles which could not. have been foreseen.Why Kongwa was a First Choice33. The Kongwa area of the. Central Province v/as selected by the Manag-ing Agents as the scene for the most intensive effort in preference to theSouthern Province or Urambo since:(a) the supply problems involved in the development of the southern province rendered the large scale development of that area im-practicable until adequate port and rail facilities were established ;(b) railway facilities were already available in the Central Province andKongwa could be linked to the Central Railway Line by construct-ing a short spur railway joining the main line at Msagali, which,lies 16 miles south of Kongwa and 240 miles up the line from,the port of Dar-es-Salaam ;id) although Urambo in the Western Province lies on the Central Rail-way line, the Government of Tanganyika advised the WakefieldMission, in 1946, that it would not be advisable to begin opera-tions in the Urambo Region for a year or eighteen months;because the development of the Mpanda Lead Mine was planned,,and it was thought that all available labour would be absorbed,in extending the Central Railway Line to the Mine ;

7i(d) it was expected that most of the land in the Central Province wouldbe easier to clear than the land in the other two Provinces, wherethe number of trees per acre was greater.Rooting Difficulties at Kongwa34. It had been expected that after the bush at Kongwa had been flattened by   *bulldozers, and the larger trees felled, heavy rooting machines towed behind the tractors could pull out the roots which were left in the ground to a sufli-cient depth for the planting of groundnuts.  Unfortunately, the roots of theKongwa thorn proved unduly obstinate, and presented a much more serious problem than was anticipated, and it was found that heavy duty ploughswere required to cut the roots; at the time such ploughs were obtainableonly from the U.S.A., and were in short supply.  New machines and otherappliances also had to be designed, tested and then re-designed in the light,of experience.  The technique of root ripping had to be reconsidered.  Andinstead of the original cycle of bush flattening, windrowing and ripping, it became necessary to introduce these additional operations in order to leave-the ground ready for agricultural work:  (i) Rootcutting with heavy disc ploughs which replaced ripping except at the height of the dry season, when it was found necessary,,because of extreme soil compaction, to rip first as well;(ii) root-raking, and(iii) levelling which was necessitated by the uneven condition of theground after this sequence of operations.35. All the original estimates were based on the assumption that oneacre of ground could be cleared for agricultural operations in under twotractor hours.  Because conditions in Kongwa were more difficult than hadbeen anticipated, and because it took time to train the machine operators, in:actual fact, during the first year, it took eight hours to clear an acre.   A:new technique had to be found and new experience had to be gained. Andin the light of all the difficulties and experience, it has indeed been possibleto find new ways to make this work more efficient.  But there is no doubtthat for the early pioneering year of the Scheme the clearing problem at.Kongwa proved far more serious than was anticipated. Africa had presented the pioneers with a problem which would only be solved in the hard school of experience.Tractor Difficulties36. The Wakefield Mission in calculating that 150,000 acres could be cleared and planted in the first year had assumed that there would be an effective tractor force of 200 tractors, efficiently driven by skilled operatorsworking 10 hours per day for a 6 day week.  On their calculations, there-fore, from March, 1947, it was assumed that there would be deployed suffi-cient machines on clearing and cultivating operations to procure 12,000operational hours per week.   This target was unattainable because of the inevitable difficulties in securing enough machines and skilled personnel, and building up the necessary base facilities to ensure their effective deployment inthe midst of virgin bush in East Africa, about eight thousand miles by sea from the United Kingdom, with all supplies coming through the smallcongested port of Dar-es-Salaam, then 256 miles up the metre gauge single-track railway of the Tanganyika Central Railway, and then 35 miles northover inadequate roads.   Faced with all the formidable difficulties on the spot, the average number of operational tractor hours achieved in any week in the first sbTmonths was only 1,710, less than one-sixth of the Mission&apos;estimate.   And not all the operational hours could be devoted to clearing

72the bush. The tractors which were available had to meet many demands.New roads and railways had to be built, sites had to be cleared for buildings,and a number of tractors had to be reserved for the vital task of trainingAfrican drivers. Thus, up to the end of November, 1947, the average-number of tractors per week engaged on land clearing was only 57 lessthan one half of the number specified by the Mission.37. Because it had been impossible to obtain new tractors, the ManagingAgency had to search the war-time disposal dumps of the world to findsuitable second-hand tractors. In numbers alone it succeeded in findingall that it required, but their condition, after war-time use, was not satjs-factory. Some tractors - were reconditioned in the United Kingdom, andthen shipped out, but many more were consigned direct to Dar-es-Salaam.Unserviceable tractors dogged the Managing Agents from the beginning. by july 1, 1947, there were 97 heavy tractors delivered in Kongwa, but only44 per cent, of these were operational, and as more and more tractors arrived,the problem of maintaining the &quot; runners &quot; in operation and reconditioning the&quot; non-runners&quot; became more and more serious. In August, 1947, therewere 285 tractors in Kongwa, but only 95 were serviceable, and by november the number had fallen to 65.38. It was not possible to maintain this total fleet of reconditioned tractorswithout heavy-maintenance shops, a full range of spare parts and all theother essentials which in war were needed to keep an armoured division of250 fighting vehicles in full operation. The scale of this maintenance prob-lem had been greatly underestimated, and a corresponding increase of theEuropean personnel became necessary. And above all it took time to recruitand fly out skilled mechanics, time to organise the flow of spare parts largely from U.S.A., time to erect workshops, and time to secure the necessarymachine tools to equip the workshops.Administrative Organisation39. The difficulties of clearing and the problem of tractor maintenancewould have been serious enough to make impossible the realisation of theoriginal targets, but, in addition, the Managing Agents had to face theformidable task of building up the extensive administrative base needed to support the land clearing and agricultural operations. It was necessaryto recruit a new staff for the control of this project. Experienced men couldnot be obtained for all the appointments, and new men had to be given a chance to prove themselves. The individuals assembled had to be weldedinto a team to take on a job in which there were few with previous experience to guide them. Moreover, they had to deal with bottlenecks in supplies,transport, organisation and accommodation. The acquisition of all thevarious machines, parts, materials, tools, furniture, equipment, food, mer-chandise and other stores which were necessary, and their shipment fromall over the world to the port of Dar-es-Salaam with no deep water berthsand limited storage accommodation was no light task. The port was strainedto capacity with the normal increase in post-war traffic, and the additional burden of the groundnut traffic became an insistent problem to the port-authorities. Partly as a consequence of the shipping difficulty, and partly as a result of beginning operations before the administrative services were built up, the problem of handling all the stores became a nightmare. Mobilitywas particularly vital in the case of spare parts for the reconditioned tractors-and motor vehicles. Construction of accommodation for workshops, staffs,.and offices presented another problem which also had apparently beenunderestimated.

40. As a result of all these difficulties the acreage actually under crop for march 31, 1948, was only 7,500 acres. Only 13,746 acres of bush had beenflattened in that year, and not all of it had been windrowed, rooted and-made fit for agricultural operations.Decision thai the Corporation should take over41. In the autumn of 1947 Mr. Plummer and General Harrison visitedTanganyika in company with Mr. William A. Faure, Managing Director ofthe Managing Agency. It became apparent that in dealing with the obviouslyserious administrative problems, the division of responsibility between the managing Agency (with only transitory obligation) and the Members-Designate of the Corporation (who at that time could only advise) was an interim solution Which could not be long continued. The serious natureof the difficulties in East Africa made it imperative that the day-to-daydecisions should be in the hands of the people who were to be ultimatelyresponsible for the Scheme.. 42. As an outcome of this visit the Overseas Food Corporation, at therequest of the Minister of Food, took over responsibility for the directionof the East African Groundnuts Scheme on March 1, 1948. And on April 1,1948, the Corporation took over from the Managing Agents the day-to-daydirection of operations in East Africa.Memorandum on taking over43. When the Overseas Food Corporation took over from the ManagingAgency they prepared a document setting out the position as they found it. This document which was handed to the Ministry of Food is reproducedas Appendix IV. The memorandum set out four of the main problems which the Corporation had to meet:(i) the gravely inadequate repair and maintenance services for thetractors, agricultural machines and motor transport of all kinds ;(ii) the absence in East Africa of a proper system for the receipt, pricingand physical custody of all the various stores required ;(iii) the inadequate organisation for controlling expenditure in EastAfrica;(iv) the inadequacy of control of the Contractors&apos; workValue of the first years work44. Measured against the estimates of the White Paper, progress in thefirst year was small. Reasons have already been given to show why it isdoubtful that these earlier estimates could have been achieved. They werethe vision a splendid vision for Africa, but a vision beyond attainmentby a new organisation in the difficult post-war years, with its shortages and delays of all kinds. Measured against intractable Africa the progress was,. .in fact, considerable. Men and materials had been assembled and experience had been gained, weaknesses had been revealed, but the Scheme in its future development was already and inevitably shaped.45. The Managing Agency in submitting its report to the Minister ofFood on its first year&apos;s work said: &quot; If this year&apos;s achievement were to be measured solely by the acreage planted, the results would not only be dis-appointing, but even discouraging. Such an inference would, however, beill -founded, since it would ignore the major accomplishments of this period.The decision to proceed immediately and in headlong manner on an im-provised basis has been amply justified by the valuable experience gained,,by the acquisition of heavy clearing equipment and other materials which

;would no longer have been available in later years, and most of all by theestablishment during this year of an organisation with the requisite specialistbranches and with a knowledge of the type and scope of the problems tobe encountered. We believe that on this basis it will be possible to develop the whole plan within the broad framework indicated by Command 7030.and to achieve the results anticipated by the end of the six year period.To sum up, the foundations of the Scheme have now been surely laid, andno problems have arisen to disturb our confidence in its final success. Thedifficulties which have been encountered form, in fact, the experience whichis the essential prerequisite for carrying out an undertaking of this magnitude,and should not be considered without reference to their context and to the substantial body of achievement recorded in this report.&quot;46. In setting out the reasons why the first year&apos;s operations were belowthe target, the Corporation would be the last body to underestimate the workwhich had been done by the Managing Agency.  Equipment for the jobhad been assembled in East Africa from all over the world. There were, onFebruary 29, 1948, to name but a few of the principal items: 571 heavytractors, 119 rooters, 214 agricultural tractors, 1,023 ploughs, harrows, discs,-cultivators and other pieces of agricultural machinery, 955 lorries and even10 landing craft engaged on transport of supplies along the coast and upthe Lindi creek. Not all of this equipment was in operating condition; but all had been obtained and shipped to East Africa.  Roads and airstrips hadbeen made.   Men had gained experience.   Buildings were going up fast.jAnd small though the acreage planted had been, a crop of groundnutswas grown.

CHAPTER 3THE CORPORATIONS first year  AND  ORGANISATIONPART I: GENERAL OUTLINE OF PROGRESS47. When the Corporation took control, land-clearing and agriculturaloperations, and building work had begun in Kongwa, Urambo andNachingwea. In addition, staff was working in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and-at the African Training School at Ifunda.48. Kongwa (256 miles by rail from Dar-es-Salaam) is in the Central Pro-vince of Tanganyika, long. 360 35&apos; E., lat, 6&quot; S., in a 20-25 inches rainfall belt,-and is 50 miles from Dodoma, provincial capital, to whioh it is connectedtoy a spur railway, that meets the main central railway at Msagali.49. Because it was decided by the Managing Agency to make the first main-effort at Kongwa, it was a natural consequence that the East African Head-quarters of the Groundnut Scheme and ultimately of the Overseas food corporation should be there. Major-General Harrison and his administrativeheadquarters team exercised supervision over all East African areas fromKongwa.50. Urambo (590 miles toy rail from Dar-es-Salaam) is in the WesternProvince of Tanganyika, long., 310 55&apos; E., lat. 50 S., in &amp; 30-35 inchesrainfall belt. Urambo is 60 miles from Tabora, provincial capital, and ison the central railway that runs from Dar-es-Salaam to Lake Tanganyika.51. Nachingwea (320 miles by road there is no railway from Dar-es-Salaam) is in the Southern Province of Tanganyika, long. 380 45&apos; E.,lat. 10&quot; S., in a 30-40 inches rainfall belt. Nachingwea is 100 miles fromthe nearest port Lindi, and is 30 miles north of the main Lindi-Masasi road.It has no railway facilities : nor was the port of Lindi capable of handling the Corporation^ incoming traffic. Because of this, and pending the con-struction of a harbour and deep water berths at Mtwara, work had started on the construction of a temporary- port at Mkwaya, on the Lukeledi river,seven miles from Lindi. Goods passing through this port had, and still have,to be unloaded into lighters or barges at Lindi, and sent up river toMkwaya.52. Ifunda (375 miles by road from Dar-es-Salaam) the African training school centre, is 11 miles from Iringa, in the Southern Highlands, and is contained in a mud-briGk and thatched housing settlement (originally erectedfor Polish refugees).Land Leases, Etc.53. The terms for the occupation of land for development tentativelyagreed between the Tanganyika Government and the Corporation wereawaiting the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on March 31,1949.  The terms briefly were: (a) Period: Thirty-three years with the right to apply for renewal for two further periods of thirty-three years after the thirty-third and sixty-sixth years. Compensation to be paid for unexhaustedimprovements in the event of non-renewal.

(h) Rent: Five East African cents per acre per annum.(c) Forest Royalties: to be paid on all &quot;fine timbers&quot; utilised by theCorporation and on all timber sold. All timber felled in clearingoperations to be extracted and utilised so far as is practicable.(Extraction plant and saw mills have been provided.)(d) Survey Costs and Registration Fees: to be met by the Corporation.(e) Compensation: on a scale approved by the Governor to be paid toany persons displaced. Removal is subject to alternative suitableland being available and to the agreement of the persons con-cerned. (The number affected has been small. Compensationhas included the provision of water supplies.)(f) Termination: The lease to be subject to termination or variationat-^any time in accordance with any agreement which may be entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand the Government of Tanganyika for the transfer of theCorporation^ undertaking or any part of it to the TanganyikaGovernment.54. The Corporation enjoys no privileges in East Africa that are notenjoyed by other large-scale enterprises,^ and is given no exemption from taxation.A.   KONGWA   REGIONGeneral Description55. The area in which development operations were originally recom-mended consisted of some 500,000 acres of the Central Province of tanganyika which, except for a small percentage of open grassland, knownlocally as Mbuga land, is covered with a thick bush vegetation, consistingmainly of commophifa thicket with scattered acacia spirocarpa trees.56. A site at the foot of the Kiboriani Hills and some six miles south of thedevelopment area was chosen as the base of the Scheme because of the easewith which it could be linked to the Central Railway line by constructinga 16 mile spur from Msagali.57. Poor earth roads linked Kongwa with Dodoma, the provincial capital^and Sagara, fifteen miles to the East, where sweet water was available.58. Kongwa is 3,500 ft. above sea level. The climate is good. Temperaturesvary from 50&quot; F. to 90o F. according to the season and time of day. Rain-fall is spread over a five-six months&apos; season from November to April, usuallywith a short dry spell in January or February. The only rainfall records forKongwa Village itself were compiled by the Church Missionary SocietyMission in the Kongwa Valley ; these had been kept since 1939, and whenthe Wakefield Mission visited the district, covered a period of seven years.The records of the Central Province as a. whole show that the rains areerratic and droughts may be expected one year in seven.  (See para. 95.)Position when the Overseas Food Corporation took over59. On March 31, 1948 the population of Kongwa was:  O.F.C.

60. Land-clearing had been in progress for nearly a year and plans hadbeen based on setting up 10 Units of 30,000 acres each. &quot;The following table shows the progress which had been made in land-clearing.Land-Clearing at March 31,1948Unit 1 Unit 2 Unit 3Bush flattened ...      ...      ...   13,746 acres Nil       NilWindrowed    ...      ...      ...      ...   10,442    ,, Nil       NilRooted ...      ...      ...      ...    4,503 Nil       Nil61. Of the area in Unit 1 which had been completely cleared, 3,400 acresbad been planted with groundnuts. Planting begins with, the early rains which,at Kongwa, usually start early in December. Crops normally ripen for harvestin an average of 113 days. In addition 4J00 acres of Mbuga land (opengrassland with a little scattered scrub) in Unit 2 which required practically no clearing had been planted with groundnuts. There were 289 heavytractors in the Region, of which only 81 were fit for service for land-clearing,instructional purposes, road making and all the other jobs for which they were needed.The 1947-48 Harvest62. The first crop was ready for harvesting in May, 1948. Rainfall hadbeen adequate but cultivation had been inadequate because of insufficienttime being available in which to bring newly cleared land into level agri-cultural condition. This led to poor stands of plants, due to uneven depthsof planting, and to difficulty in carrying out proper cultivations.63. Harvesting began in the middle of May and was finished in August.The groundnuts are first dug out of the ground by a digger. Some difficulties were encountered. The soil, baked by the sun, had become compact andsolid, with the result that there was a tendency for the blades of the digger to fail to penetrate the ground to the required depth and so bring all the nutsto the surface. Secondly, the abrasiveness of the red soils caused excessivewear of the digger biades. (The large size Valencia nut, which has a tendency to separate from the vine, was difficult to dig, for it was found that themajority of the nuts remained in the ground and could only be harvestedby hand gleaning. For this reason it has been decided not to grow thisvariety in future in Kongwa.)64. After digging, side delivery rakes are used to rake the plants (with thenuts attached to them) into rows. Little trouble was experienced with the machine but the uneven ground and shallow trenches left by the diggers made it difficult to ensure collection of all the plants. Where raking was ineffectivethe crop was windrowed by hand.65. Combine harvesters were then used to pick up the plants, and to separately -ate the nuts from the vines and bag them. This operation was successful.66. The yield from the 1947-48 crop was as follows (in lbs.):  Valencia     Natal Common Spanish BunchUnit 1 ...     ....      473,206 686,743 694,560Unit 2 ...      ...      613,938 533,698 506,6971,087,144 1,220,441         1,201,25767. Averages per acre worked out thus: Valencia Natal Common Spanish Bunchlbs. per acre lbs. per acre    lbs. per acreUnit 1         ...      ...        593 604               557Unit 2         .......    436 564               457

with a general average of 528 lbs. per acre. It was. however, estimated that&apos;an average of 181 lbs. per acre were left in the ground. A further 66,472 lbs.of pods were obtained from 234 acres of local Wagogo nuts.Storage of the 1947-48 Crop68. Apart from the small quantity shipped to the United Kingdom for scientific and technical purposes, the whole of the 1947-48 crop was reservedfor Seed for the following year. The bagged nuts were stored by each Unit onraised earth plinths and dunnage and covered with tarpaulins. Anti-termiteprecautions were taken by the application of arsenical preparations tothe earth plinths. No termite infestation was observed during the year.The quality of the 1947-43 Crop69. Free fatty acids develop in vegetable oils through the action of enzymesand moulds. Their presence is a direct loss in terms of food, and their excess-sive formation in hot humid conditions can amount to heavy losses unlessinstallations for pre-heating the oil seeds are provided. Professor T. P.Hilditch, of the Department of Industrial Chemistry, Liverpool University,was commissioned by the Corporation to investigate this problem. The resultsof his research [detailed in Appendix VI (12)] on the 1948 crop at Kongwaare as follows: (a) In colour and in low free acidity the groundnut oils &quot; far surpass anyraw groundnut oil which has hitherto been on the Englishmarket.&quot;(b) Both groundnuts and sunflower seeds stood up well to six monthsstorage in dry conditions.(c) Access of moisture to the seeds activated mould spores causinglipolytic hydrolysis of the fat, and this happened with both pre-heated and untreated seeds of both crops.(d) On the other hand the groundnuts yielded oil of unusually highiodine value.(e) The Kongwa oils contain much more linoleic and much less oleicacid in combination as glycerides than most groundnut oils,but this does not materially affect their value for the edible fatindustry except in so far as:(i) it might make the oil slightly more susceptible to the onset ofoxidative rancidity, and(ii) that correspondingly more hydrogen would be needed to pro-duce a hardened fat of given iodine value.70.  On these results it would appear that:&apos; (a) there is no immediate need for the installation of artificial dryers,but a final decision cannot be -made until further tests have beencarried out in succeeding seasons and -in the three localities;(b) especial care is required to secure suitable dry conditions in bulkstorage and bulk transport, particularly in the ships&apos; holds.71. Professor Hilditch is repeating these investigations with the 1949 crops.Clearing and planting targets-1948-49 season72. The targets which the Corporation found that the Managing Agentshad decided upon for the year 1948-49 were to clear sufficient land in theKongwa Region to plant 45,000 acres of groundnuts and some 31,000 to37,000 acres of sunflower. Sunflower was one of the rotational crops sug-gested by the Wakefield Mission and experience of the first year had shownthat it was especially suitable and economic for production on first-year land.Experience had also shown how difficult and uneconomic it was to plant,cultivate and harvest an underground crop such as groundnuts on newlycleared land, full of roots and stumps, and left in a rough and uneven state.

Land-cleasing73. The sequence and methods of land-clearing operations at Kongwa,although all the land did not require the whole of these operations, were as follows: (a) FlatteningThis operation was carried out with heavy tractors moving through thebush in echelon round a pre-defined area, starting at the outside andmoving in ever narrowing circles. Tractors moved independently^ withbulldozer blades attached and kept raised some two to three feet from theground.(b) Contouring and Windt owingBecause of the necessity for water conservation and anti-erosionmeasures and the need for a line on which to pile flattened bush, con-tours were marked out at nine-foot vertical intervals, followed by wind-rowing, an operation in which all flattened bush is pushed by bulldozerson to the contour lines, thus leaving continuous strips of cleared land.(c) BurningBurning, prior to windrowing, was carried out on as many fields aspossible. This lessened the volume of bush to be moved, and reduced the load on the tractors and speeded-up the windrowing operation.(d) StumpingFollowing windrowing, the removal of any stumps left in the groundwas necessary and had to be conducted as a separate operation, sincethe stumps were, in the main, too big to toe tackled by the equipmentused for breaking up roots left in the ground.At first, the angle dozer was used but later in the year it was foundthat another rooter performed a better job with less strain on both thetractor and the equipment. This rooter consisted of an adaptation of aripper, having a fiat, straight blade welded across the two outer tineswhole assembly set back behind the extremity of the rippermain frame.(e) Rooting .This operation followed the stumping and,was originally effected byuse of a 3 tined ripper, the necessity for single or double ripping toeinggoverned by the varying soil conditions.During the past year, rooting was for the most part carried out bya specially designed rooter. The success of this implement was limitedsince, through the abrasiveness of the soil in dry weather, the wear onthe machines was rapid. In addition, the larger rooters placed a strain on the most highly powered tractors.The most successful machine for rooting at Kongwa was found to bean American heavy duty disc plough, which was used extensivelytowards the end of the year. Nevertheless, the rapid wear of all movingparts (particularly the discs) was considerable, and created a sparesshortage which made it impossible to keep all machines working.(f) RakingAnother operation before ground could be handed over for agri-cultural purposes consisted of the raking together of all roots cut and brought to the surface by the rooters. This operation was performed by a drawn rake specially designed and built for the Corporation.

(g) LevellingA levelling operation was desirable before light-wheeled tractors were put to work. A leveller, made locally by the Corporation, met this needvery efficiently, it is constructed of heavy material, such as rails, inthe shape of a rectangle,- with diagonal ties of the same material;6 in.-8 in. steel pegs in sleeves welded to the frame help to pick up anyroot trash still left. These levellers can be used in pairs dragged behinda heavy crawler tractor.The leveller can be used effectively only during the dry months.Other Regions74. Materially the same land-clearing operations are necessary at Uramboand in the Southern Province.Improvements in Technique75. Much has had to be learned about the technique of bush clearing andthe Corporation has concentrated the work of its Operational Research Uniton this problem.76. The original White Paper estimate of the cost of clearing per acrewas  3 17s. 4d.; in the first year the comparable cost of clearing an acrewas calculated as being ten times this figure. Much of the difference was due to the tasks proving more difficult than was anticipated. other reasons for the disparity were the lack of experience in African bushclearing; the unserviceable condition of the heavy tractors ; the lack of proper equipment to deal with the peculiar root system at Kongwa ; wind-rowing flattened bush when green and so bulldozing an excessive quantityof soil into the windrows, and root ripping in the height of the dry season,with resultant wear and tear on moving parts.77. One great economy has been effected by the introduction of chaincable clearing. This system had originally been tested by the ManagingAgents and the Contractors and rejected. It was again tried experimentally,at Urambo, in January, 1949. This time it was adopted for use in all areas and the technique was improved at Kongwa. A heavy 3 in. chaincable is attached to two heavy tractors which move through the bush20-30 feet apart. A third tractor (&quot;the scrum half&quot; as it has-been named)follows to deal with particularly stout trees which the chain cable cannotpull out of the ground. The use of the chain cable greatly increases thearea of bush which can be flattened in a day.78. The degree of improvement in efficiency and rate of pulling thevegetation out by the roots was so encouraging in the Isoberlinia-Brachystegia-Olher Species Woodland at Urambo under suitable conditionsof soil moisture to a depth of two to four feet that an early trial was organised in the Deciduous Thicket at Kongwa, again with considerable success. Owing to the differences in soil, in soil-moisture and in growth-form of aerial and root portions of the thicket vegetation, the resultsachievable were shown to be less satisfactory than those at Urambo. Towardsthe end of the period under report preliminary trials of the method weremade at Nachingwea, Southern Province, with promising indications for thefuture.79. This improved method of flattening undoubtedly was the outstandingachievement of the past year and holds great promise for future work inthe clearing of vegetation.

80. The chain-cable method of clearing not only reduced the cost offlattening and rooting, but facilitated windrowing and the extraction ofmerchantable timber. .81. The following table shows the estimated time which a tractor took tocomplete each operation at Kongwa towards the end of the year:-Flattening       ...      ...      ...     2.0  acres per tractor hourWindrowing    ....      ...      ...     0.5        ,,       ,,       ,,Stumping       ...      ......      1.43       .,       ,,       ,,Ploughing or Rootcutting   ...      1.0        ,, .,,Raking ...      ...      ...      ...     2.0-    Ripping        ...      ......      1.66Levelling        ...      ...      ...      8.0 ,,       ,,Tractor Maintenance82. The essential problem in preparing the land for agricultural operationsis to keep the heavy tractor fleet in full operation.83. When the Corporation took over there were in Kongwa 208 uhservice-able tractors and the engineering section (paras. 217 et seq.) of this Reportshows the urgent measures which were immediately taken to get these tractorsinto operation and to maintain them in good condition. The experience whichwas gained at considerable cost at Kongwa can now foe applied elsewhere particularly in the Southern Province. During the year it was not possibleto organise the repair services in order to get all the tractors into operation for clearing. Consequently the proportion of unserviceable tractors remainedhigh throughout the year.Agricultural Operations84. The sequence of agricultural operations following the taking over of land from Contractors for agricultural purposes was as follows:  (a) Tandem DiscingThis operation was carried out immediately prior to planting, usingtandem disc harrows.In the main these harrows were used singly behind a 35 h.p. wheeledagricultural tractor, but, under rougher conditions, a more even pull, withconsequently less wear on bearings, was given by using a triple hitchbehind heavy crawler tractors.(b) PloughingDry season ploughing has been carried out this year. On the red soilsthis calls almost exclusively for the use of the heavy duty disc plough.On large areas on Unit 1, prior ripping was necessary in order to getadequate penetration.On the grey or black Mbuga soils, disc ploughs were used almost exclusively; on these soils, or where adequate $penetration can beobtained in dry weather, light ploughs do a satisfactory job.Dry season ploughing with heavy duty disc ploughs as a continuingoperation is costly. The alternative is one-way disc tilling after the firstrains, but this necessitates a large number of extra tractors during the peakplanting period.(c) Planting(i) GroundnutsThis operation was carried out with a power lifted 4-row planter,incorporating fertiliser placement attachments.

The rate of planting was 56 lbs. of seed per aeres giving 3  inchspacemen! in rows 23 inches apart and theoretically 45.000-50,000plants to the acre. Counts of plant population however showed anaverage of about one-third of this figure.(ii) SunflowersThe planting of sunflower was carried out either with drills or with groundnut planters, where the availability of special seed platesallowed. The row spacemen ts ranged from 7 inches to 28 inches,for experimental purposes the bulk being in 14 inches and 21 inchesspacing between rows.(d) WeedingThis was carried out either once or twice, as the state of theground and weeds dictated. The implement used was a spring-tined12 ft. weeder. This was effective when used at the proper time, i.e.within a few days of weed germination. Once weeds had obtained agood hold, the effectiveness of the implement was considerably reduced.(fi)&apos;. CultivatingThis operation caused most anxiety, as the mid-mounted cultivators in use were in no way equal to the job on the hard red soils on unevenland. Various other experimental types were tried with varying success.This year an adaptation to a digger frame, using old and worn diggerblades, gave the best results, throwing a 3 inch-4 inch ridge at the sametime, thereby facilitating digging. These adaptations will be completedfor use almost entirely on the groundnut crop next year.   ,Local Conditionsi85. The important soils (more fully described in Appendix V) are (1) theUpland Red; (2) Upland Pallid (yellow to grey) ; and (3) the alluvial Valleyor Mbuga or semi-Mbuga, which may range from red through chocolate toblackish. To the nearest 1,000 acres the proportionate distribution of thesemain soils is: (1) 44*000; (2) 18,000; (3) 13,000. Much research and sur-Treying has been done regarding these with a view of improving conditionsitfor agricultural operations.86. The drying out and compaction of the red soils at Kongwa preventthe dry season ploughing of the whole acreage.  Where the soils are suffi-ciently friable this operation is completed in the dry season. The ploughing-or one-way disc tilling of the remainder has to await the onset of the rainsin December.  As the optimum planting period after the beginning of the rains is only seven to eight weeks, work has therefore to go on at very heavy pressure. Weeding and light harrowing follow the planting of the crop where necessary, and finally, one or two inter-row cultivations, designed to ridgeup the soil round the growing plants.   This period of cultivation is alsointense.  It is followed by a short break until harvest begins, in late Aprilor early May. Ploughing follows immediately on the harvest in order that asmuch land as possible can toe prepared before the soil hardens.87. By introducing sunflower into the rotation it is possible to extend the planting season, while its tall growth and heavy leafage tend to smotherweeds and reduce the number of post-planting operations, thus relieving the pressure on men and machines at peak periods. It is also possible to delay the harvesting of sunflower longer than that of groundnuts, again-extending the season and enabling more economic use to be made of tractorpower. .

&apos; 88. Because the rainy seasons are longer in the Southern and WesternProvinces than in Kongwa this extension of planting and harvesting seasonsshould be more marked.Working Rates for Agricultural Operations89. The following operating rates were achieved at the end of March, 1949,at Kongwa:  (i) Levelling     ...     ...     8.00 acres per tractor hour(ii) One-way discing	1.06	at      .	**(iii) Tandem discing     ...	. 2.23	99    -	99(iv) Planting groundnuts	1.62	99   -	99(v) Weeding     ...	4.00	99	99(vi) Drag harrowing     ...	4.00	&apos; 1*	99(vii) Cultivating ...	1.46	99	99(viii) Digging      ...      ...	1.00	jf	99,(ix) Raking	2.00	99	99(x) Combining  ...      ...	1.50	99	99(xi) Ploughing: Light ...	0.50	99	99Heavy ...	0.75	99	99Acreage planted at Kongwa90.

The 1948-49 season was marked by a severe drought which affected the greater part of, the African continent. At Kongwa the rains were late in starting and planting was not possible before January 1, 1949, several weeks late. Germination was satisfactory, and with good February rainsthe crops showed promise. The critical growing month of March, however,was disastrous. Practically no effective rain fell after the first ten days, and both groundnut and sunflower plants suffered severely; the earliest sowncrops ripened prematurely, the latest sown were almost completely lost.92. While the Kongwa Region suffered so severely portions of the Northern,Western and&quot; Lake Provinces also suffered and even in the Eastern province the drought was felt. Kenya, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, SouthernRhodesia and the Union of South Africa all experienced in varying degreesthe rigours of severe drought.93. The Urambo Region suffered more from the irregularly distributedand late rainfall than from the total shortfall.94. The Southern Province Region suffered least.

URAMBO   REGION96. When, on April 1, 1948, the Corporation took over control at Urambo,the target for the agricultural year was the clearance and planting of 2,000acres.97;. Of that figure a total of 833 acres had been flattened, 605 acres ofwhich had been to provide a protective tsetse-free belt around the village,and 228 acres of land destined for agricultural production.   The only other.agricultural work being carried out was on two experimental plots.98. During the year 2,789 acres were sown as follows:  Groundnuts     ...      ...     487 acresSunflowers      ...      ...   2,052 acresMaize   ...      ...      ...     250 acres99. Rainfall records of any length of time are confined to those taken atTabora, where the mean value is 33.40 inches based on 40 years&apos; readings.100. These records show the following years which experience rainfallsbelow 20 inches:  1901/02 season ...      ...   10.78 inches1909/10 season ...      ...   18.53 inches1948/49 season ...      ...   18.92 inches101. Otherwise all the seasons except that of 1924/25 (21.73 inches) havehad upwards of 24 inches^102. The soils are of three main types: the red, the grey and the Mbuga(or blackish, of which the first two make up the higher portions and thealluvial soils the sides and the channels of the drainage lines. These soilstend to be patterned on the catena system, their distribution being con-ditioned by topography, but this catena arrangement may, from time totime, be broken.103. In terms of nutrients and depth these soils are less satisfactory thanthose at Kpngwa but in physical characteristics are more amenable to fieldhusbandry operations. Compaction is negligible except in certain circum-stances in the grey soils, while abrasiveness is not a factor of any importance.

104. The depth ranges widely, bnt over wide areas is sufficient for arableagricultural purposes.105. The lower lying alluvial soils tend to become either water-logged orhighly saturated with water during periods of heavy rain; they thus setparticular hazards for agricultural development.106. The type of country at Urambo is quite different from that ofKongwa; being thickly-wooded forest. The clearance of this forest washampered, not only by the difficulty of bringing down the fairly large trees,but also by the special difficulties of rooting. After experiment, the chaincable method of clearing was adopted. During dry weather, however, manytrees, instead of coming out by the roots, snapped off at ground level or above, and the special difficulty remained of grubbing out the roots.107- Mechanical equipment for stumping was limited, and this was thegoverning factor in the rate of clearance of forest and the preparation of the soil for agricultural purposes.108. The following table gives the clearing figures for the twelve monthsup to the end of March 1949:  Acreage flattened ...      ... 11,027 acresPiled and burned ...      ... 5,803 acresStumped and rooted ...      ... 3,524 acresCompleted     ... ...... 4,066 acres109. The chain cable method of flattening brought the rate for thatoperation during the wet season up to 1.43 acres per tractor hour, insteadof .61 acres per tractor hour by the old method.110. At Urambo at the beginning of the year there were 115 heavy tractorsin the Region, of which 8 only were serviceable. At the end of March 1949the number of tractors had increased to 122, of which 76 were serviceableand in daily use.Agriculture111. By the end of the planting season, the &quot;drill&quot; was so well evolvedthat the planting machines were on the heels of the levellers (carrying outthe final clearing operation), and were working in the same field. In onefield, ground which in January was virgin forest, was in March fully sownwith a crop.112. Agricultural equipment was used throughout in the followingsequence:  Groundnuts Sunflowers MaizeOne-way disc One-way disc One-way discPlanter Drill PlanterCultivatorDigger andside rake113. Experience this year shows that two types of groundnuts, NatalCommon and Valencia, both of which are rapidly maturing varieties, arenot best suited to Urambo. Asiriya Mwitunde, a variety grown with some success by local Africans, and which is long maturing, has been selected for future planting.

C.   SOUTHERN   PROVINCE114. It is not possible for the Corporation to give more than a sketchyreport on the conditions existing and the amount and character of thework done in the Southern Province at the time of the take-over from the managing Agency.115. The Contractors, John Mowlem &amp; Co., Ltd., who were engaged for building and land clearing operations, had started work in November, 1947.They had been unable to conduct a stocktaking of the plant, machinery and stores in their custody at February 29, 1948. What operations hadtaken place had depended on inadequate communications, consisting ofa temporary and makeshift harbour, constructed especially for the purposeat Mkwaya, on the Lukeledi river, and one poor road from Mkwaya toNachingwea a road which, because of the badness of its surface, wasdamaging to transport and which, in the rainy season, was impassable. Somework was going on at Mkwaya, an experimental agricultural plot had been started at Nachingwea, experiments had been made in the winching-down oftrees, considerable road work had started, and boring for water had alsobegun, although with little success. Some work was in progress in the con-struction of the new harbour at Mtwara, by Messrs. Balfour Beatty &amp; Co. Ltd.116. At the beginning of March, 1948, the total staff of both the Corpora-tion and the Contractors in the Southern Province was just under 200Europeans and approximately 4,000 Africans,117. This is country of high rainfall: 30 to 40 inches mean annualfall, of the monsoon type, with some proportion of local instability fall.The rains may begin in late October or November and continue until April,in which month they begin tailing off, ceasing in early to mid-May.January, February and March should be the wettest months, December beingnot far behind.118. There are about 100 rainy days and from the few reliable records Masasi (average 28.24 inches), Liwale (average 35.? inches), Songea (average44.4 inches), and Lindi on the coast (average 36.8 inches) and from thenature of the vegetation, it seems that the region experiences a more regular and more bountiful rainfall than Urambo and a very much more satisfactoryone than KongWa. During the season December,&apos; 1948, to early May, 1949,the rainfall recorded at Namanga, Unit 1, was 26.18 inches, which was good considering the continental drought.119. Falls of high intensity may be experienced, making soil conserva-tion measures essential.120. The vegetation is made up of Miombo (Jsoberlinia-BrachystegiaWoodland) somewhat similar to that at Urambo but with various differences in species and in the representation of these. Combretum Other Species,Open Woodland, is quite widely represented in portions, or may be foundin either catena or mosaic relation to the Miombo. In certain portions ofthe Miombo there may be present a dense understorey of Bamboo (Oxyten-anthera abyssinica). Mbuga vegetation grass wiik a thin tree populationfor the greater part exists along the drainage lines and may be extensivelyrepresented or may be attenuated in width if considerable in length.Essential Factors for Developments121. It was clear to the Corporation that the future development of theSouthern Province areas depended in the first instance entirely on com-munications, which were virtually non-existent. (See paras. 51 and 233.) TheCorporation therefore decided that any significant development in the

Southern Province would have to wait until the completion of the railwaythen under construction from Mkwaya to Nachingwea, and Mkwaya itselfimproved as a temporary port by the provision of a second landing hard,three T head piers, a stacking ground, and the requisite number of cranes,plus a railway jetty.122. It was also clear to the Corporation that major developments in theSouthern Province and the consequent demands made by the exporting of crops, necessitated full use of at least one deep water berth at Mtwara,well as a railway from Mtwara to the groundnut areas.123. All the evidence showed quite clearly that a deep water berth atMtwara could not possibly come into operation until the end of 1950 atthe earliest. It was equally clear from the progress being made that therailway from Mtwara would be completed before the harbour work wasfinished. But as the harbour is the dominant factor, this would have been of no immediate benefit to the Corporation. On the other hand, the railwayengineers estimated that the railway from Mtwara to Nachingwea wouldbe finished by the spring of 1949, too late to affect the acreage whichcould be sown at the beginning of 1949. An oil pipeline from Mtwarato the Nachingwea area was being constructed. A contract for this work had been placed by the Managing Agency in 1947. By April, 1948, 70 percent, of the material for it had been shipped or delivered.A Year of Preparation124. In view of all these circumstances, it was therefore decided to use1949 in the planning of the work to be done in the following years, in theimportation and distribution of stores, equipment and merchandise of allkinds, and in the erection of the necessary buildings, workshops, storage accomodation, schools, hospitals, and so on. In addition, 1949 was planned to provide the Corporation with a good deal of experience in the efficiency of the tractors and agricultural machinery destined for use in the southern province, and to undertaking a full survey of the original areas designatedin the first two blocks as being likely to provide suitable land for oilseedproduction.First Results125. For experimental purposes however the efforts of the corporation and the Contractors during the year resulted in the following:  (a) Clearing AcresBush Flattening      ...............    1,200Windrowing or Piling        ...      ...      ......     640Stumping......      ............     350Rooting        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     640(b) Planting.   Five hundred and sixty-four acres were planted to a variety of groundnuts, sunflowers, maize, castor, safflower,sorghum and other crops on an experimental basis only.(c) Heavy Tractors.   At the end of March, 1949, there were 266 heavytractors in the Province, of which 154 were operative.Staffs at March 31, 1949(a) European Staff:European staffs engaged in the Southern Province were:Corporation   ......      ...      ......Contractors59097493

The figures for Contractors&apos; European and African staffs include those employed not only on land-clearing and construction work by JohnMowlem &amp; Co. Ltd., at Nachingwea, but also those employed by the otherContractors engaged in the Southern Province.Mkwaya127. One landing hard was in operation, and progress had been madein the provision of a second. Only one T Head pier had been completed:the stacking ground was unfinished. One of the two port workshops hadbeen finished, and a Technical Stores building almost completed.Mtwara Harbour128. Towards the end of the year a serious shortage of labour in Mtwara,which had slowed up the progress of work, ended. The Contractors how-ever, were a long way behind their schedule. Food shortages in the area had also affected their timetable.129. At the end of March, 1949, very little progress had been made onpermanent work, and the situation was as follows: -	Average	-  Per cent.Nature of work	Number men	completed to	employed	March 31,	March, 1949	1949(a) Temporary Works		i.

On the Mkwaya-Nachingwea section the laying of the line to Mtua,six miles west of Ruo, had been completed, making a total of 20 miles laid atthe end of the year. The total length of the Mkwaya-Nachingwea section is approximately 94 miles.

131. The completion of these communications will contribute considerably to the opening-up of the country.Oil Pipeline132. At March 31, 1949, 116 miles of the oil pipelines had been laid, 88miles welded, and 70 miles tested. The engineers in charge of the work, andthe Contractors responsible for the pipeline construction, estimated at the endof March that the whole length of line would be laid, tested and ready for operation by the end of July, 1949. When in operation the average through-put of the pipeline will be 80/90,000 tons per annum of petrol or fuel oil.Dar-es-Salaam133. The Corporation has 178 employees in Dar-es-Salaam, most of themengaged in transportation and supply work. Some of them are accommo-dated in local hotels; others live in the Corporation^ own houses at OysterBay, a newly-developed residential area to the north of the city, and at Kura-sini, a new suburb south of the harbour. The Corporation owns 40 houses,and rents three, all of which are occupied by the staff. The remainder live in small mud and wattle houses, with grass roofs, in what was originallyan RA.F. Transit Camp. This Camp, which provides messing and allother necessary services, has been kindly lent to the Corporation by the Tanganyika Government.134. The main Stores area is at Pugu Road. This consists of godowns and open stacking spaces.  Pugu Road is served by a railway from the Docks.135. By courtesy of the East African Railways, quantities of prefabricatedbuildings and general building materials are stacked in the railway storagearea, 300 yards from the main stores. The use of this area, which also is served by rail, is gradually diminishing.136. The Corporation has leased a plot of land in Pugu Road, which isundeveloped but has been used as a vehicles park. Medical equipment and stores are also held on this land.137. During the year numbers of heavy tractors, road-making plant, land-clearing equipment etc., were stored at the Corporation^ Tractor Siding adjoining the Docks-but practically the whole of this has now been cleared.D.   ORGANISATION   AND   STAFF.138. In December, 1948, the Resident Member, Major-General DesmondHarrison, became seriously ill in Kongwa. Soon after his deputy also fellill. The doctors reported that the illnesses were likely to be long and thatconvalescence at home was desirable. In January the Chairman flew to EastAfrica and for three months acted as Resident Member in General Harrison&apos;splace.139. Subsequently General Harrison for reasons of health resigned hisposition as a Member of the Board.140. The Groundnuts Scheme had started under a centralised management in Kongwa which exercised complete authority over all operations in allRegions. The size of the Scheme, the speed with which it was launched,and the problems presented by Africa seemed to offer no alternative to this form of direction and control; but in the autumn of 1948, six months fromits taking over control, the Board decided that the time had arrived for acomplete change in the administrative machine and for decentralisation tothe Regional General Managers in Kongwa, Urambo and the southern province. The chart in Appendix III (B) shows the administrative organisa-:tion in existence at the end of 1948: the chart in Appendix III (C) showsthat in existence at April 1, 1949.

HeEceffifcralisissg Administration141. Perhaps the most important administrative change was the vesting of authority in the Regional General Managers. Their technical staffs engineer-ing (both civil and mechanical), agricultural, transportation, labour and per-sonnel for the first time became answerable to them instead of to the techni-cal managers and departmental heads in Kongwa, whose functions were alsoaltered so as to make them advisory to the Regional General Managers.All members of the Regional General Managers&apos; staffs were encouraged bythe Board to take decisions, for themselves ; the Central Management, whichconsists of the General Manager (Agriculture), the General Manager(Engineering) and the Controller of Finance, welcomed this Board policy.142. The Corporation cannot claim that decentralisation was working per-perfectly by the end of the financial year. It was clearly going to take time formen who had been accustomed to exercise considerable authority for executive action to have confidence in the ability of other men, working hundreds ofmiles away, to exercise that authority without their direct supervision. It wasalso going to take time to train men who had hitherto been accustomed to look elsewhere for direction to take full responsibility for their actionsinstead of always referring to the Headquarters Management. Neverthe-less, the policy of decentralisation was welcomed by the majority of the staff and shows every sign of producing a more efficient organisation.Limitation of Programmes143. In February, 1949, the Chairman was joined in East Africa by three off his colleagues, Sir Charles Lockhart, Mr. John Rosa and Mr. A. J.Wakefield. As a result of the information given to them and their investi-gations, it was decided that the programme of development at Kongwa wouldbe limited for the time being to three Units (approximately 90,000 acres).Soil compaction, rooting problems, marginal rainfall and the desire &quot;to makethe main effort in the Southern Province, all influenced this decision, which resulted in notice being given to the Contractors working in the region,Messrs. Pauling &amp; Co. Ltd., of the discontinuance of their services. Itwas also agreed that clearing and development (at Urambo would, forthe time being, also be limited to 90,000 acres. The Board also decided in the light of experience gained at Kongwa and Urambo that more detailedscientific surveys of soil and topographical features in the Southern Provinceshould begin immediately the long grass, which in the summer prevents surveyteams entering the bush, had been burned. It also ordered that the logisticsof large-scale development in the year 1950-51 should be re-studied.144. The decisions to limit developments at Kongwa and Urambo resultedin general retrenchment.&quot; It affected the staff. Some members of the staffs of the Corporation and its Contractors were moved to new or different areas,while others were proved redundant.Staff Relations145. Relations of the Corporation with staff must be viewed in the lightof the conditions under which they live and work. The European staff, includ-ing Contractors&apos; staff, at March 31, 1949, comprised 1,982 men and womenwith families of 371 women and 368 children, a total community of 2,721men, women and children. Only a small&apos;minority had ever been in Africabefore and for the most part they were living in totally unfamiliar surround-ings in small townships and camps which they had created by their own effortsunder the handicaps which this Report discloses, on sites which two years earlier were uninhabited and waterless African bush. It was not only theconditions of life which were unfamiliar, so were, and perhaps more import-predominantly, the conditions of work.  While the staff as a whole had previous

training and experience in their diverse avocations, few, if any, had ever been called upon to apply themselves in the conditions which they necessarilyhad to face. Moreover, few had worked together before and there were notthe customs and traditions which, in an established undertaking, guide thenewcomer and help him to settle down.  The whole staff were newcomers.146. Beyond the exacting conditions of living and of work, including formany prolonged separation from their families, the staff had to face theadditional strain imposed by the unexpected setbacks and the disappointingprogress of the project to which they had devoted themselves. They hadto do so, moreover, without the opportunities for recreation and diversion of interest which established communities provide and to which most hadbeen accustomed. The experiment of creating self-contained living and working communities on such a scale in so short a time and in such exactingand alien conditions in a tropical country might well have failed on the human side. That the majority stood up as they did to the discomforts anddisappointments of these first two years and maintained their loyalty to this new enterprise to which they had set themselves is a tribute to &quot;the spirit inwhich they responded to its inspiration. The test will come when it is seenhow many choose to return when their first term of engagement is com-pleted. This test can already be applied to the Contractors&apos; staff with theirshorter periods of engagement. The proportion applying to return isencouraging for the future.147. The number of Africans in employment on March 31, 1949 was27,836. It was manifestly impossible at the outset to provide for these menanything but the most temporary accommodation without room for their families, nor was it possible to improve conditions rapidly, and although the pace of improvement had been greatly accelerated by the end of the year the Corporation was still unable to offer, except to a small minority, the living conditions provided by long established industries, and certainly not the standards which it is a policy of the Corporation to provide for all as timeallows. The ration scale is adequate and even generous by African standards,but the Corporation has not offered special inducements not provided byother good employers. It has, however, an elaborate trade testing systemdesigned to encourage and reward the man who wishes to better himself byhis own efforts.148. News travels fast in Africa and the African is not much attracted bythe prospects of future benefits when present conditions are hard and onlyslowly improving. Nevertheless, the Corporation has had no difficulty inattracting African labour in the numbers which it requires. That this shouldbe so in a country where there is competition for labour and where labour shortage is regarded by many as a bar to rapid development, is convincing evidence of the relations built up by the Corporation^ European staff withthe African labour. As the Corporation^ long term labour policy maturesit should be possible to consolidate these good relations permanently.PART II:  AGRICULTURE149. Mr. D. L. Martin, who had been one of the members of the WakefieldMission, and who, from its inception until February, 1948, had been theGeneral Manager of the Project in East Africa and thereafter general manager (Agriculture) on secondment from the United Africa Co., Ltd.,relinquished this post in December, 1948, his place being taken by Mr. JohnPhillips, Professor of Botany at Witswatersrand University, Johannesburg.

I 150. Briefly, the objectives were to select, to clear, to prepare, to protectagainst soil deterioration and erosion, and to plant as much suitable acreage[as possible in Kongwa and Urambo, and to survey and experiment in theSouthern Province.H 151. During the year the Corporation set a target for planting for 1948-49Ipf 50,000 acres. As shown in paras. 90, 98 and 125 (b) a total of 49,620 acreswas in fact sown to crops, distributed as follows:  Kougwa      ..................   46,267Urambo       ...      ....      ...      ...      ...      ...    2,789Southern Province.......     ..........      564I 152. The indications at Kongwa and Urambo were that heavy disc ploughswere the most satisfactory of the implements used for root-cutting. During[the year ho adequate experience in root-cutting had been gained in theSouthern Province.I 153. In comparison with the overall standard shown at Kongwa in the season 1947-48, there was in 1948-49 a considerable increase in the efficiency of agricultural operations. At Urambo the standard was fair, while in theSouthern Province it was lower.154. At this early stage in the agricultural operations it was impossibleto lay down, on any scientific basis, a final rotational policy and practice.Local observations and collateral experience gained from similar conditionselsewhere in Africa, however, were called upon. For purposes of planning,a rotation based on Groundnuts and Sunflower, with a grass resting period,has been assumed. Time and local experience within each of the Regionsalone will be able to decide the details of the final policy.155. General observations on soil fertility made by the Scientific Depart-ment suggest that certain of the soils at Kongwa are probably the most satisfactory in the three Regions, so far as nutrients are concerned. Lessfertile conditions are known to occur in the Urambo Region, the southern province being probably intermediate.156. The compaction and abrasiveness of the Upland Red and Pallid soilsat Kongwa (para. 85) are serious factors hot met with in either of the other regions. So serious are these conditions at Kongwa, on these soil types,that they have set a heavy handicap on the efficiency and economic workingof equipment and cause rapid wearing away of moving parts in the dry season.In the rainy season, the compaction and abrasion are negligible.Pests and Diseases157. At Kongwa doubtless due to the less humid conditions there hasbeen ah encouraging freedom from Rosette disease in groundnut plants, butat Urambo the small acreage established this year was severely attacked,particularly when planted late. In the Southern Province, R.osette diseasehas not yet proved a problem.  It may well appear in the future.158. Calidea dregei, a Pentatonid &quot; Stainer&quot;, the so-called &quot;Blue-Bug&quot;,followed up its history of attack on small-scale planting of sorghum at kongwa and Urambo in 1947-48, by a really heavy infestation of sunflower inthese two regions this year. While a heavy toll is taken of young sorghumgrain in the &quot; milk &quot; stage, it is not yet clear how severe the effect is on sun-flower. At Kongwa the effect was slight but at Urambo there was someretarding effect on seed-development.

m159. Puccinia helianthi, &quot;Sunflower Rust&quot;, showed itself on the variety&quot;Mars &quot; at Kongwa but did not do much damage. Under the moister con-ditions of Urambo and the Southern Province this fungus may prove moredestructive on such susceptible varieties as &quot; Mars &quot;.160. According to variety and stage of its development, the fungusCercospora personal a (Black Leaf spot of Groundnut) produced varying degrees of defoliation or loss of leaf-tissue, but, appearing rather late in the stage of development of the crop, did not take any appreciable toll.161. Aspergillus cf.niger, one of the black collar-rots, under moister con-ditidns on parts of Unit 2, Kongwa, killed a small proportion of groundnutseedlings; it was not a major disease in either of the other Regions.Varieties Sown, and some Conclusions162. On a field scale, the main varieties sown were:  -(a) Groundnuts: Natal Common; Valencia; with relatively smallacreages of Spanish Bunch and Virginia Bunch.Natal Common was the most satisfactory, owing to the capacity,of the nuts to adhere to the vines, as against the tendency ofValencia to shed the nuts in the digging and lifting operations.In the moister conditions of Urambo and the Southern Province,this short-period nut would set special, difficulties in harvestingand drying. A long-period variety, such as Virginia Bunch, andsome of the local native variety, are required for these conditions.Valencia is, therefore, considered unsuitable for mechanicalharvesting. Spanish Bunch has yielded poorly. The VirginiaBunch seed utilised was of poor quality and sown too late.(b) Sunflowers: Mauthner&apos;s Dwarf (striped seed) was most largely sown;smaller acreages were devoted to Jupiter, Pole Star and Mars.The behaviour of Mauthner&apos;s Dwarf, Pole Star and Jupiter wasencouraging in terms of evenness of height and maturing ; Mars of mixed origin was less satisfactory but as a &quot; late &quot; varietyholds promise.(c) Maize: Relatively small acreages at Kongwa and Urambo weresown to Hickory King, Potchefstroom Pearl, Kenya Yellow. Fordry conditions, Kenya Yellow is clearly the most suitable.Cattle163. Toward the end of the year, Zebu (African) cattle were bought locallyat Kongwa.  Such live-stock and natural range management work was aimed: at obtaining information about animal husbandry prospects and technique,and at producing meat beef, mutton and pork for European and Africanconsumption.Soil Conservation164. In January, 1949, Regional Conservation Officers were appointedto the three Regions ; three Conservation Officers were posted to the KongwaUnits, and one to Urambo, while an officer with particular aptitude forexperimental work was attached to the Operational Research Unit forland-clearing and soil conservation wo^k. For professional guidance allthese Soil Conservation Officers look to the General Manager (Agriculture).(i) Kongwa Region165. The construction of windrows assisted conservation of moisture andof soil.  Some areas were unsuitable for clearing, either because of excessivesteepness or because of drainage channels.

166. Mapping, in connection with conservation planning for the future,was started. 1       &quot;(ii) Urambo Region167. This Region has been comparatively well reconnoitred and surveyedfor land-usage, and Soil Conservation Officers were able to make a land-usesurvey for land-clearing, agriculture and soil conservation. This helps inthe production of good maps for the guidance of the land-clearing staff.168. Provision was made for the leaving of belts of trees by each field,as water and wind erosion protective measures.(iii) Southern Province169. The high intensity of the rainfall indicates the need for careful con-servation measures in this Region measures designed to drain water off thearable lands, with minimum soil wash and wastage.170. Wind erosion is not likely to be a serious factor but the strips of natural vegetation that are being left around the fields and similar strips along the drainage channels will reduce this.171. Plans were made for replacing the natural vegetation, along the roads,iby oil-bearing trees and shrubs likely to serve the double purpose of conser-vation and of providing a crop.ForestrySurveys of Utilisable Timber172. Surveys indicated that there is a moderate amount of utilisable timberthe Urambo Region and that, while there is a very fair amount in theSouthern Province, its distribution is patchy.173. Important species are:-Pterocarpus spp. (Mninga)Afzelia quanzensis (Rhodesian Mahogany)Dalbergia melanoxylon (East African Ebony)Acacia pollensAfrormosia angolensisBurkea africanaDiospyros mespiliformisErythrophloeum africanum174. Because of their usefulness after adequate drying and impregnation,the various Brachysteiga spp. and Isoberlinia globiflora were studied. Avery fair proportion was observed of large, well-shaped boles of these hithertolittle used species.Agronomic Matters : Kongwa Region175. (a) Varieties and FertilisersGroundnuts of the following varieties were sown on acreages thus:  	Natal Common	Valencia	Spanish Bunch	Virginia BunchUnit 1......			4,850	200Unit 2......	2,488	2,675	2,926	 Unit 3......	8,371	3,405	 	 	10,859	6,080	7,776	200

176. The main varieties and acreages of Sunflowers sown were as follows:--4	Dwarf Hungarian	Mars	Pole Star	JupiterUnitl......, Unit 2 ... Unit 3......	11,157 600 1,115	760 1,730 285	345	1,313 2,221	12,872	2,775	345	3,534177. Fertiliser was used over the following acreages:  			Groundnuts	SunflowersUnit 1............... Unit 2.......    ......... Unit 3............	590 4,004	3,672 413	4,594	4,085(b) Rotation178. As this was the second crop on a relatively small proportion of the acreage planted and the first on the remainder, no rotational sequence couldbe arranged. Where possible, suitable land under crop to nuts in 1947-48was again put to nuts ; all suitable first year land also went to nuts. Landnot considered suitable, for any reason at all, for nuts was put to sunflower.179. The land two years under nuts (1947-48, 1948-49) would next seasongo down to sunflower. Land down to sunflower in 1948-49 would, whereverdesirable, go down to nuts, bearing in mind that the total amount of landsown to nuts should generally be restricted to those portions presentingno difficulties in the harvesting of this crop.Lessons Learnt:180. Among the results gained through experience in the year under reviewwere: (i) Much information regarding the potential of the three Regions;(ii) The policy of limiting Kongwa to three Units at present.   A decision(a) to progress north of the railway at Urambo instead of south as was originally thought best, and (b) to work steadily in theeastern section of the area chosen in the Southern Province beforeattempting any land-clearing in the western section.(iii) The chief contributions resulting from reconnaissance work, that were made to land-clearing and subsequent operations, were:  (a) The decision to limit flattening to the moist season of the year,thus reducing the proportion of roots and stumps left in the soil;(b) The improved chain-cable method ;(c) The use of the heavy disc plough as a root-cutting implement,in the Urambo Region particularly, and to a lesser degree inthe Kongwa Region.id) An improved method of piling or windrowing as practised atUrambo, and an improved method of piling thicket debrisat. Kongwa.(iv) There were, of course, also the gains in knowledge and techniqueaffecting many other kinds of work, and of future co-ordinationof efforts and utilisation of labour.

part III: ENGINEERINGA.   CIVILPurveys181. During the year surveys have been carried out in all Regions, delineat-ing Unit boundaries, roads arid traces, siting installations, locating sources ofwater, etc., according to the availability of staff and weather conditions.Kongwa is ahead of all other areas in the matter of survey, although towardsthe end of the year work at Urambo had progressed rapidly. In the southern province the task is much more difficult, trot steady progress was maintained,and additional staff made it possible to attain greater speed in covering vastareas of trackless and uninhabited country.Road Construction182. (i) Kongwa: All roads are of the consolidated earth type and needeaconstant maintenance to keep them fit for the great amount of heavy trafficusing them. Eleven miles of major roads and 372 miles of secondary roads-were constructed.183. In addition, considerable maintenance was carried out on the fourteenmile stretch of Government road, between Kongwa and Sagara, in order tokeep this road open to water tankers, and to lorries bringing meat and vege-tables from Mlala, 20 miles east of Sagara. Also, a short stretch of road onthe up-wind side of the tented hospital was metalled and surfaced, in orderto mitigate the dust nuisance and as an experiment in all-weather road-construction.184. (ii) Urambo: All roads here are earth roads. Twenty-eight miles of major roads and thirty-one miles of secondary roads were constructed.185. (iii) Southern Province: The keeping open of the Government road from Mkwaya to Nachingwea has been a major task. The Corporation hasbad to maintain and improve the road, and traffic interruptions have beenfew. A proposal to metal and surface the whole length of this vital road was rejected mainly because of the high cost. A number of secondary roads havebeen cut and compacted.Water Supply186. (i) Kongwa: During the year the Kongwa township was provided witha piped water supply, initially from the saline boreholes on the Mbuga, latersupplemented by more drinkable water from deep boreholes in the MissionValley. Until December, many pump breakdowns were experienced andKongwa was often short of water. With the installation of electric sub-mersible pumps in early December, these water shortages ceased. As moreboreholes were sunk, the piped service was increased and improved, until bythe end of March, a completely reticulated system was in operation. It isstill necessary to restrict supplies of water to nine hours a day as the growth of the township is faster than that of the production and storage of water.187. Further boreholes have been sunk in the Units but the quality of thewater from them is poor and water for drinking must still be tankered to the units from Kongwa and Sagara.188. (ii) Urambo: The water supply improved throughout the year.Industrial water for building purposes was drawn from shallow wells near theRailway Station, and was adequate. Regional Headquarters was served by four deep boreholes, with a fifth as a stand-by, and their total yield of 1,600gallons an hour proved sufficient, although more will be necessary beforelarge-scale operations can be sustained.

97189. (iii) Southern Province: The Corporation had suffered some anxiety-as a result of a near failure of water in the Nachingwea-Ruponda area inJune of 1948. The Regional Manager then in charge of operations took an-early and rather rapid decision, which resulted in the evacuation of most members of the European staff of the Corporation and of the Contractors toLindi, which step held up all work for some three weeks or more. At theend of that time, although water shortage had not materially lessened, thestaff returned to work and a water rationing scheme was somewhat belatedlyfinto operation. As a result of this alarm new boreholes were sunk, andthe end of the year there was sufficient water to meet requirements, andthe geological and geophysical surveys showed that new boreholes cominginto operation should be sufficient to supply the needs of the next two orthree years. Despite this, detailed surveys were made of the possibilities ofobtaining water from other sources, and one scheme, estimated to supply400,000 gallons a day was being studied at the end of the year.190. At first water supplies to Mkwaya were brought by tanker from small stream several miles away, but this temporary arrangement ended,^and a proper piped supply drawn from the Lukuledi river, sedimented,passed through a sand filter and chlorinated, is now in operation.  Chlorina-tion was being done by hand pending the arrival of automatic equipment.Bnildmg Construction191. (i) Kongwa: The provision of houses had first priority, but in-addition much other work was undertaken.192. Work completed during the year was:(a) European HousesMarried Quarters, 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms 196Single Quarters   ............ 290(b) African HousesCamp* Structures, including latrines ... 460Married Quarters, kitchens, ablutions ... 628Single Quarters, dhobi houses, etc. ... 400(c) Tented AccommodationConcrete bases for tents ......     60,480 sq. ft.(d) Storage Accommodation     .........      27,321 sq. ft.(e) Workshops Accommodation ......     44,835 sq. ft.193. In addition a new European shop and a 400-bed hospital were built. The hospital wards and administrative buildings are of pre-fabricatedtimber sections and the Operating Theatre, Pathological Laboratory, Kitchens,Laundry and Mortuary are of Landcrete block construction. The hospitalreplaced by the end of the year the original tented hospital, and was completed in six months.194. A timber-built European day school of five classrooms opened onNovember 1, 1948.195. (ii) Urambo: Urambo is more fortunate than Kongwa in the avail-ability of local building materials. Utilising the simplest form of constructionknown, i.e., mud and wattle with thatched roofs, the building programmeachieved creditable and pleasing results.196. Owing to the nature of the soil, mud bricks proved satisfactory, andsome storage sheds were built from this material with roofs of corrugatedsheeting on locally made Belfast trusses.m

197. Work completed during the year was : (a) European HousesMarried Quarters, 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms 18Double rondavals        ......     ... 18Single Quarters   ...      ...      ...... 69(b) African HousesCamp Structures............ 16Single Quarters (other than tents)     ... 386Married Quarters (other than tents)    ... 350(c) Asian, etc..

In addition a new European Ward to the Hospital was built, a newPathological Laboratory completed and a start made on a new African Ward.Two new shops were built, one being used temporarily as a EuropeanSchool.199. (hi) Southern Province: Progress had been limited by the lack of road and rail facilities. In addition an appreciable portion of the Corpora-tion&apos;s mechanical equipment was diverted on loan to the construction ofthe railway.200. Work completed during the year was:(a) European HousesMarried Quarters.........     ... 29Single Quarters   ....      ...      ...... 42(b) African HousesCamps and Structures (2 camps of 100) 200Camps and Structures (3 camps of 400) 1,200Single Quarters (other than tents) ... 1,400Married Quarters (other than tents) ... 100(c) Tented AccommodationConcrete bases for tents.........       1,200 sq. ft.(d) Storage Accommodation     .........      12,960 sq. ft.(e) Workshop Accommodation.........       5,000 sq. ft.201. (iv) Ifunda Training Centre: Civil Engineering work began inJanuary, 1949. A small amount of plant and machinery was received, oldbuildings were improved and a few new ones constructed.202. For the three months of 1949, work completed was :(a) European HousesMarried Quarters............ 2Married   Quarters   (conversions   fromSingle Quarters)        ...      ...... 3(b) African HousesRenovations and maintenance only     ...

203. Building work which was carried out by trainees was of a high orderof workmanship.204. (v) Dar-es-Salaam: Ten permanent houses at Oyster Bay were com-pleted and twenty-one were acquired or erected at Kurasini. Work beganon another sixteen houses at Kurasini. Additional bandas and servants-quarters were erected at the Corporation^ Transit Camp.205. Five thousand and forty sq. ft. of additional covered storage wereouilt at Pugu Road..Electricity Supply206. (i) Kongwa: High-speed field type generating sets were installed and electricity is now laid on in both the Koc^va base and in the Units. to conserve fuel oil and to save wear and tear of the generators current is supplied each day for only eleven hours out of the twenty-four.207. (ii) Urambo: Work began on the building of a Power Station and considerable additions to the plant were made.208. (iii) Southern Province: A limited scale of domestic electrificationwas provided at Mkwaya, Mohumbika and Nachingwea, but the scale wasbelow that of Kongwa and Urambo.Sawmills209. A sawmill at Urambo, despite age and inadequacy, produced 160,000board feet of timber, all of Which was consumed. Impregnation againsttermites was carried out by means of dipping tanks, which were installedduring the year.    ,210. Good use was made of a sawmill in the Southern Province. Thedifferent natures of the timber encountered make it necessary to instalrobust and varied plant for successful exploitation. The situation was expected to improve in April when a new and modern sawmill was to comeinto operation at Noli.Quarrying211. The production of ground lime for agricultural purposes and burntlime for building was started with creditable results in the middle of June,1948, at Lugufu, 134 miles west of Urambo.212. Quarrying at Kongwa and in the Southern Province consisted chieflyof the production of crushed and broken stone for construction purposes.In these two regions the arrival during the year of mechanical loaders andcrushers enabled production to get, and keep, ahead of demand.Airfields213. Airstrips were constructed at Nachingwea and at Urambo, both ofwhich were in constant use throughout the greater part of the year.Research214. Experiments in soil stablisation, termite control in buildings, the utilisation of waste products (e.g., groundnut husks) as fuel and many otherpieces of research were conducted.

B.   MECHANICALTransport215. In the early part of the year there was a shortage of mechanical transport because of the non-arrival of new vehicles to take the place of machines bought from Surplus Disposals Stores and which became unservice-able. By special efforts the Mechanical Engineering Department and the contractors managed to mitigate serious breakdowns. Towards the endof the year 325 new and complete Bedford lorries and 344 Bedford chassisarrived. Arrangements were made for bodies for these chassis to be made inNairobi.216. The Agricultural and Mechanical Transport Workshops at Kongwawere developed on a temporary basis and carried out major repairs to 1,519vehicles.Heavy Repair Shop217. During the year the Heavy Repair Shop at Kongwa in which repairs to heavy clearing tractors are made was taken over from the ContractorsTvho had been responsible for its operation, and its size and scope were increased. By June, 1948, the Heavy Repair Shop was able to keep the contractors equipped with heavy tractors and during the year overhauled289,Wastage of Tractors218. The chain cable clearing method of bush flattening recently adoptedhas in Kongwa increased the wastage of tractors. The thorn bush at Kongwais dense. The tractors travelling through it are constantly having theirradiators and their engines covered with falling leaves and light brush.The result is that the engines boil, with consequent damage. As the groundto be cleared at Urambo and in the Southern Province is covered withtrees and the growth is far less dense than at Kongwa, it is not anticipatedthat the chain cable clearing method will of itself necessitate similar increasedrepairs. Already it has been found at Urambo that the breakdown of tractorsused in this operation is less than it was when more traditional methodsof clearing were being used.219..At the end of March, 1949, there was a total of 429 serviceable heavytractors in all areas. At the beginning of the year there were 91.Unit Workshops220. At Kongwa, three Unit workshops were established, staffed and equipped to service, maintain and repair agricultural machinery and thetransport used on the Units together with a service station designed to meetthe needs of Headquarters&apos; and Contractors&apos; transport.221. At Urambo a Unit workshop was established before the end of 1948.As at Kongwa, this workshop supported the agricultural operations andrepaired Unit transport. Repairs to heavy tractors were not the responsibilityof the Mechanical Engineering Department. These were effected by the Con-tractors. The situation here differed from Kongwa, where repairs were carriedout directly by the Corporation.. 222. In the Southern Province little progress was made, in the building ofworkshops at Mkwaya and Nachingwea.223. In Dar-es-Salaam a tractor siding, adjacent to the Docks, wheretractors were retained on arrival for inspection and where necessary for lightrepairs, before being sent to Kongwa or Urambo, was taken over from the

firm of Contractors who had been responsible for it. In addition, workshopsused also for the assembly of incoming lorries were established. Repairs toand maintenance of transport Used by the Corporation in Dar-es-Salaam were also carried out.Land-Clearing Equipment and Agricultural Machinery224. It was the responsibility of the Mechanical Engineering Departmentto assemble all specially developed equipment and agricultural machinery.The Department was responsibe for the formation of an African MechanicalEngineering Training Wing at Ifunda. Nearly 100 trainees from the schoolhave been received in the workshops and their progress is being charted.PART IV: TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONSThe Port of Dar-es-Salaam225. The most serious transportation problem in 1948-49 resulted from the inability of the port of Dar-es-Salaam to cope With the rush of post-wartraffic and the requirements of the Groundnut Scheme. There are no deep-water berths in the port and all ocean-going vessels have to discharge their cargoes into lighters.. The port area itself was congested and insufficientspace was available for the discharge and storage of goods. The averagetonnage of imported goods handled each month in the last year before thewar was 7,150. In March, 1948, the imports were 28,000 tons. This increasein traffic had overwhelmed the port facilities. The quays and storage shedswere choked with goods. Ships were sometimes held for weeks before theycould be discharged. The daily rate of discharge had fallen from 450 tons per working day to 300 tons.226. These delays in handling cargoes urgently required for operations in east Africa were a constant menace to the smooth build-up of the essential supplies and equipment. Regular meetings were held in Dar-es-Salaambetween the Corporation, the Port Authority, and representatives of the east african Conference Lines. Representatives of the Ministry of Transport alsovisited the port. Immediate attention was given to short-term measureswhich would reduce congestion in the port and enable it to be workedefficiently at the optimum rate for its existing facilities. There was no immediate alternative but to limit the loadings which the East AfricanConference Lines would accept each month for Dar-es-Salaam. In April,1948, this monthly total was 11,000 tons general cargo and 3,500 tons vehiclesof which 2,750 and 875 tons respectively were allocated to the Overseas food corporation.Conference in London, January, 1949227. It is vital that the capac:&apos; of Dar-es-Salaam port should be increased,and the Corporation has taken a full part in all the official discussions todetermine what long-term improvements can be made to the port. these discussions culminated in a conference in London in January, 1949, underthe chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and which was attended by:The Minister of Food,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Transport,Sir Philip Mitchell, Governor of Kenya,Mr. E. R. E. Surridge, Acting Governor of Tanganyika,

Sir Reginald Robins, Member for Transport, East African High Corn-mission,Mr. A. Dalton, General Manager, East African Railways and Harbours,Mr. J. R. Farquharson, Deputy General Manager, East African Railwaysand Harbours,Mr. Roger Norton, East African Commissioner,Representatives of the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Food,the Colonial Office, and the Chairman and two Members of theCorporation.Improvements to the Port228. The Conference favoured a scheme for the construction of deep-waterberths at Dar-es-Salaam and for other improvements to the port facilities.As the biggest commercial user of the port of Dar-es-Salaam the Corporationattaches great importance to these new developments.229. Other measures were adopted for improving the port facilities. Addi-tional barges and lighters were provided. New cranes were erected and additional machinery and storage space was made available. An experiencedport manager was appointed. All these measures, combined with a generalreorganisation of the working of the port, increased the ability of Dar-es-Salaam to handle its traffic. It was agreed that Conference Lines trafficcould be increased to 15,000 tons per month of which the Overseas food corporation^ share was 4,500 tons general cargo, 1,000 tons vehicles and1,000 tons of cement.Shipping to Tanganyika230. During the thirteen months ended March 31, 1949, a total of 95,474freight tons of supplies and equipment for the Corporation was shipped toTanganyika from the United Kingdom in 60 ships. This included 41,398tons of general cargo, 15,906 tons of cement and 2,063 vehicles weighing38,170 freight tons. Of the total 47,516, 36,952, 8,598 and 2,408 tons respec-tively were for Dar-es-Salaam, Lindi, Mikidani and Mombasa. The greaterpart of these shipments consisted of goods purchased directly by the Corpora-tion, but supplies purchased by Contractors for their own contracts or for* common-user purposes are also included where the Corporation controlledpriority of shipment and arranged the provision of shipping space. The totalnumber of consignments was about 50,000 a ad of units of cargo about 320,000.231. Shipment to Tanganyika was arranged of a wide variety of cargoesfrom 22 foreign and Imperial countries in all five continents. These included a Whole shipload frOm Alexandria, carrying the majority of the remainingsupplies from Disposals sources in the Middle East. Among other itemswere shipments of seed, of petrol and diesel oil from South Africa, waterpiping and other material from India, agricultural machinery from Canada andthe U.S.A., and foodstuffs from Australia. Wherever possible, cargoes forthe Southern Province were routed so as to avoid Dar-es-Salaam.Quicker Turn-round of Ships232. The Corporation made a substantial contribution to the improvementof performance at all the ports concerned. Special arrangements were madeto give quick turn-round to the special chartered ships. Lighterage, for operation by the Harbour Administration, was provided at heavy expense,and sufficient storage was maintained at Dar-es-Salaam to make it possibleto clear the Corporation^ cargoes quickly off the quays. The arrival ofthe more difficult cargoes was planned in phases to avoid overwhelming theport facilities.

Coastwise traffic233. Almost all the goods required for the development of the southern province had to be shipped through Lindi. A rough road can be usedbetween Dar-es-Salaam and Lindi during the dry weather only. The journeyby lorry takes three days.234. Lindi provides a sheltered anchorage for ocean-going vessels and asmall stone lighterage jetty with one light steam crane. Five landing craft were used for the movement of heavy equipment and supplies to Mkwaya.Freight rates for the normal transfer of equipment were prohibitive. It cost 148 to ship a heavy tractor the two hundred miles from Dar-es-Salaam toLindi as compared with  178 from London to Dar-es-Salaam, a distance of8,060 miles. And the services of the local coastwise vessels were so irregularthat it sometimes took three months to move urgently required supplies food for example from Dar-es-Salaam to Lindi.235. Towards, the end of the year the coastal shipping position improved,and economies were effected by despatching equipment on ships direct from london to Lindi, thus by-passing Dar-es-Salaam and easing the burden atthat port.Railways236. Dar-es-Salaam and Kongwa.and Urambo are linked by the CentralRailway Line. This is a single track metre-gauge railway which handlestraffic between the coast and Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria, and also carriestraffic for the Belgian Congo.237. The increased traffic of the post-war years combined with the factthat there had been little renewal of rolling stock during the war threw avery heavy strain on the Central Line when the opening up of Kongwa andUrambo began.238. The shortage of engines and rolling stock had resulted in a sub-stantial build-up of stores in Dar-es-Salaam. The position improved duringthe year; for the arrival of new and second-hand rolling stock, includingfour * practically new locomotives, trebled the capacity of the Central Line.239. The Corporation^ rail tonnages from Dar-es-Salaam showed a pro-gressive increase, as the following, the weekly average of rail tonnage move-ments, shows:  Kongwa: First half of 1948 ...      .........   313 tonsSecond half of 1948        .........   548First quarter of 1949      .........   828   ,,Urambo: First half of 1948 .........      ...   138   ,,Second half of 1948.........   262   ,,First quarter of 1949      .........   363   ,,Motor Transport240. The Corporation tooJk over from the Managing Agents 955 lorries, 76jeeps and 18 motor cars. Almost all of these were obtained from surplus war stores and were not expected to remain serviceable for long. Newvehicles were ordered to replace them but their arrival was delayed and themaintenance of adequate motor transport service in the summer of 1948 pro-vided a serious problem. The position did not ease until 200 new trucksarrived in October, 1948. At the end of March, 1949, there were 1,536lorries in East Africa of which 1,082 were new.241. As the jeeps purchased from the surplus war-time dumps wear outthey are being replaced by a British equivalent, 400 of which have been ordered for the Corporation. At the end of March 185 of these machines were in East Africa, all of which were in use.

Air Transport242. Because the distances between the various areas are so great and because other transport services are so inadequate the Corporation, like allother commercial enterprises in similar areas, had to rely a good deal on air transport. An arrangement was made with the East African airways corporation for the charter of aircraft for the use of the Corporation. the charter aircraft were used for the regular transport of staff and urgentstores. In addition regular service aircraft were used. As a temporary measurea freight aircraft was chartered in March, 1948, to fly fresh fruit and vegetables from the Southern Highlands to those parts of the southern province where the shortage of fresh food was acute, and also to transportAfrican labour between Dar-es-Salaam and Lindi.243. During the year a contract was entered into with a British CharterCompany to fly members of the staff of the Corporation and of the Con-tractors, and others, between Britain and East Africa. This contract resultedin a considerable economy to the Corporation.Tele-Communications in Tanganyika244. During the year Kongwa was connected by telephone with Dar-es-Salaam and also with Urambo. Services are restricted, and it is seldompossible to use the inter-territorial telephone more than twice a day. Theservice is poor, and subject to frequent breakdowns, which are aften reported as being due to the depredations of giraffe.245. Offices in Kongwa and in Urambo are linked by local field telephoneequipments. That in the Kongwa region has been augmented by some radio-telephone sets. Provision was made also for radio-telephone control of the oil pipeline in the Southern Province. There is no telephone communicationwith Nachingwea, Mkwaya or Mtwara.246. Telegraph services within the Territory are irregular and slow. the contents of telegrams are frequently distorted owing io the incapacity ofnon-European telegraph clerks to transcribe the messages accurately.Postal Services247. Postal services are also slow and irregular. At times it takes a week for a letter to travel from Kongwa to Dar-es-Salaam a distance of 256miles and despite the frequency of air services to Britain, which do the journey from Dar-es-Salaam to London in a day-and-a-half, letters to andfrom Kongwa and London have taken eleven to twelve days. The G.P.O.is assisting the Corporation by sorting all mail destined for Kongwa inLondon, and forwarding it in one bag. The East African Post Office isinvestigating the possibility of making greater use of air services to speedthe delivery of mail.PART V: supplies the Base248. The Supplies Department in East Africa is based on Dar-es-Salaam.It is responsible for the ordering from London and local purchase of supplies in East Africa, and then storage. This task is complicated by the slow and difficult methods of communication between various centres in East africa and the long delay involved in securing goods from the United Kingdom.249. It had proved impossible for the Managing Agency to establish orderin the stores organisation by the time the Corporation took over from them.Consequently the Corporation did not receive a record of the stores it was taking over.

Inadequate Records of Stores250. Plant, equipment and stores had been received in East Africa without proper documentation ; this applied particularly to stores purchased fromDisposals Boards. It was not until October, 1948, that final prices wereavailable for many of the items received before February 29, 1948, andeven then in many cases no detailed breakdown of the agreed aggregatesum for a number of items was provided. A considerable volume of storesstill remained to be sorted, housed, binned and recorded. Stores recordswere fragmentary, and were not kept on a uniform basis. There was noproper documentation of stores issued, nor were all issues priced. Theabsence of a comprehensive priced Vocabulary created not only difficulties of identification, but also discrepancies in values. It was consequently impossibleto keep a financial record of, or to exercise any financial control over,the utilisation of stores. A stocktaking as at February 29, 1948, was undertaken some time after that date, but in the conditions described above,and in view of the short time which could be devoted to it, it was impossibleto make it either comprehensive or accurate. All these differences havebeen taken up in the Accounts presented with this Report, as explained in chapter 5.Stores Organisation Built Up251. It took time to recruit and train the staff, and to provide them withthe buildings needed to make the stores organisation efficient. At the endof the year the position was not entirely satisfactory, nevertheless substantial progress had been made.252. An experienced Chief Supplies Officer was recruited. His staff was organised under three managers General, Technical, and Petrol Oils andLubricants. A Chief Buyer in Nairobi directed the purchase of goods in east Africa. &apos;253. There was sufficient covered storage space for all the base stores atDar-es-Salaam. At Kongwa, although the covered storage space was in-creased, many valuable stores had to be kept under tarpaulins. At Urambono buildings were available for storage when the Corporation took over and stores were kept in marquees. By the end of the year 19,300 square feet ofcovered storage space had been provided and a suitable Supplies Officeerected. In the Southern Province, the stores were operated by the Con-tractors and held in marquees or in the open. Towards the end of the yearsome aluminium huts were provided for use as stores.254. To avoid unnecessary duplication and to escape the danger of creating a bottleneck, it is the policy of the Corporation to decentralise provisioningand storekeeping to the areas of operations, retaining in the ports little mor,than a forwarding organisation. This change in policy, and the properintegration of supplies, transportation and accounts, were introduced by stages.During the year all stores were sorted and either binned or stacked, and asystem was devised for the recording of all stores receipts and issues andfor pricing them. Consequently, at March 31, 1949, a complete and detailedstocktaking and valuation of all stores was made. Pricing, for the purposesof accounting and financial control, necessitated the preparation of a pricedVocabulary. This was undertaken by the London Office as a task of high priority, and in six months a detailed priced Vocabulary covering at least50,000 items was prepared. The values in the Vocabulary served as the basis for- the stocktaking at March 31, 1949, and are currently in use for pricingall receipts and issues.

255, All Petrol Oil and Lubricant supplies for the Southern Province were sent in drums, and although supplies were sent in rail tankers to Kongwaand Urambo, the fuel had there to be decanted into drums for storage and-eventual distribution. This was a wasteful practice and the Corporation began to install the equipment necessary for&quot; economic distribution.Immense Variety of Purchases256. Among the hundreds of items, which had to be bought were thevarious consumable stores of different departments.; a great variety of build-ing materials ; special instruments and equipment for the scientific and techni-cal work ; all kinds of medical supplies and equipment;. jute goods ; seeds, fer-tilisers and chemicals ; water-supplies equipment such as storage tanks andsteel casing for the use of well-boring contractors ; hundreds of vehicles ofall kinds ; tractors, cranes and much other machinery and spare parts.At the London End257. Before March 31, 1948, supplies for East Africa were purchased bythe United Africa Company&apos;s Buying Department on demands received from east Africa. On April 1, 1948, the Corporation decided to introduce directbuying, and this came into force on April 20, 1948, after which a minimum of goods was purchased through buying agents.258. Purchases from Ministry of Supply disposals sources diminished duringthe year, partly due to their stocks becoming exhausted and partly due to new equipment becoming more readily available.PART VI: SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHOperational Research Unit259. In January, 1949, the Board decided to establish an OperationalResearch Unit, with headquarters at Kongwa. Tests made in Great britain of machinery, plant and equipment designed for use in East Africa had notbeen of practical value, for soil and weather conditions at home are seldomcomparable with those in East Africa. Yet there was no organisation in thatcountry equipped and in existence for the sole purpose of conducting objectiveresearch into machines, processes and techniques that were being offered toor used by the Corporation.260. The Operational Research Unit was given the duty of carrying outresearch into land-clearing, agricultural, civil engineering and transportproblems, and the plant and machinery used by these departments, and tomake economic assessments of new processes and methods of development.For the time being it was placed under the overall direction of the general manager (Agriculture) while its staff of twelve men was drawn from experi-experienced members of the land-clearing, engineering and agricultural departments.A cost accountant was added to the staff. The Unit receives advice from theChief Scientific Officer, the Corporation^ Geologist, and the General Manager(Engineering).261. The Unit has concentrated mainly on applied research on equipmentalready held by the Corporation, particularly on much of the harvestingmachinery now in use. Great credit is due to the O.R.U. for the successfulwork that it did in the development and improvement of the chain cablemethod of flattening.262. Work has begun on the building of a workshop and laboratory forthe Unit.

4 iThe Scientific Department263. A very wide range of scientific, educational and other activities, isundertaken by the Scientific Department. Its main and constant purpose is&quot;the collection and study of data aimed at the development on scientific linesof an economically sound system of mechanised agriculture suited to the varying conditions of those areas of East Africa in which the Corporationoperates. The burden of the work is concerned with crop production, butas the inclusion of animal husbandry in the agricultural system becomesphysically possible it will be necessary to include studies of mixed agriculture in the Department^ programmes. At present, all matters involving animalhusbandry are specifically excluded.264. Up to the present, studies of individual crops, with the object of determining the most economic and cultural methods for their productionhave taken precedence. It is felt that the scientific study of rotations, whichis in any case a long-term project, must await accurate knowledge of theproduction of the individual crops which may enter the rotations in thevarious areas.265. The present organisation of the Department is being decentralisedto a high degree of regional autonomy in the execution of the annual pro-gramme, but not in its formation which remains centrally directed. It is theintention to maintain at the headquarters of the Department a team of wellqualified specialists, a statistical section, a central library, a central adminis-trative organisation, and central laboratories for all special investigations.The execution of field programmes will be carried out by regional staffs, based,on regional experiment farms with full mechanical equipment, but operating in the production fields as well by arrangement with the agricultural staff. Itis intended to provide each regional staff with a field biological and chemicallaboratory, mainly for routine operations, but obviously these laboratoriesmay have to be expanded in certain respects to deal with specific local prob-lems which cannot be attacked centrally. Only time will show the extentto which the centralisation of major laboratory facilities is economic, but itis worth pointing out that the permanent central laboratory will ultimately be established somewhere in the heart of the development area in the southern province, so that it will work in conditions essentially typical of those ofthe greater part of the Scheme, and will be adjacent to the great productionareas to be developed there.266. A Scientific Committee was appointed to advise the Chief ScientificOfficer on his programme of work. Its Chairman is the General Manager(Agriculture), and it includes Dr. B. A. Keen, F.R.S., Director, East AfricanAgricultural Research Organisation, Dr. H. H. Storey, F.R.S, and the Directorof Agriculture, Tanganyika. The Chief Scientific Officer is also a memberof the Committee.267. A laboratory opened in March, was by the end of 1948 carrying outroutine work on soil analysis and oil content determination, as well as indi-vidual chemical determination of a very wide range of types.268. Meteorological work covered rainfall studies only. In addition toregistered gauges at Kongwa, Urambo and Namanga, a grid of gauges was established at two-mile intervals and on the three production units at Kongwato study spatial distribution of rainfall in the 1948-49 season and to enableUnit managers to be advised of rainfall conditions from day to day. just under 50 gauges were used for this grid, and the results have been accumulatedcentrally as well as on the Units.

-.   108z69. Close relations have been maintained throughout with the East AfricanAgricultural Research Organisation, with the Tanganyika Department ofAgriculture and with the East African Agricultural Research Institute atAmani.Past Lines of Work, 1947-48270. The work of the Department from the date of its inception up to july 30, 1948, is presented in a detailed report Appendix V.Work in London271. The Agricultural, Research and Technical Department in Londonhas been concerned with crop and animal husbandry, the storage of products and other technical and scientific matters arising out of the agriculturalactivities of the Corporation. It is a link with the Corporation^ ScientificDepartment in East Africa and provides information and advice to the Boardand to the appropriate departments in London and in East Africa, and tothe Queensland-British Food Corporation. Part of the function of the Depart-ment is the distribution of information of latest developments in agriculture,science and machinery. To obtain this information, close liaison is main-tained with agricultural and scientific authorities and institutions at home and overseas, particularly in the U.S.A.272. During the year the Department advised on recruitment of scientificstaff, agricultural machinery, pollination, use of crop by-products, pest andweed control, fertilisers, fibres, land-clearing, laboratory equipment, fieldsurvey equipment, meteorology, nutrition, seed varieties, storage and move-ment of crops, rotation policy and tobacco production.

CHAPTER 4EMPLOYEES AND THEIR WELFAREPART I: PERSONNEL AND LABOUREuropean Staff273. There was a substantial increase as the work developed in the numberof European staff employed during the year. The London staff increased from119 to 232 and the staff in East Africa increased from 440 to 967.274. There is in general no shortage of applicants for work with the Cor-poration. During the year 19,500 applications were received. difficulties were experienced in obtaining accountants, field surveyors, quantity surveyors,engineering draughtsmen and agricultural scientists.275. The turnover of European employees in East Africa did not presentany serious problem. During the year there were 61 resignations, 10 summarydismissals and 27 contracts were terminated by the Corporation.. In view ofall the difficulties which the new recruit for work in tropical countries hasto face, this rate of staff turnover is satisfactory.276. A Provident Fund and a Pension Fund for employees abroad and aSuperannuation Fund for London staff were introduced. Staff councils were established in Dar-es-Salaam, Kongwa, Urambo and London.African Labour277. The Scheme will be dependent on the ability to recruit and maintain in steady employment large numbers of African labour. The White Paperestimated that the peak native labour force would be 57,100. A strongexperienced department has therefore been built up in East Africa to dealwith this part of the enterprise. Contrary to some expectations, no serious difficulties have been encountered in the recruitment of skilled or unskilled labour either for the Corporation or its Contractors. African labour strengthfigures for May, 1948, and April, 1949, compare as follows:  	Skilled	Unskilled	Total(a) May 1,1948		*	6,942Kongwa     ............	4,157	2,785	Urambo     ............	787	929	1,716Southern Province.........	1,341	2,913	4,254Dar-Es-Salaam     .........	552	554	1,106Dodoma     ............	7	3	10Totals.........	6,844	7,184	14,028(b) April 1,1949		5,060	11,963Kongwa     .............	6,903		Urambo     ............	2,527	2,046	4,573Southern Province.........	3,006	6,413	9,419Dar-Es-Salaam     .........	948	550	1,498Ifunda       ............	215	136	351Nairobi      ............	20	12	32Totals .........	13,619	14,217	27,836

278. In addition, 463 non-African and 445 trainees were in the employ ofthe Corporation. It will be noted that the labour force doubled during theyear.279. The African has shown a capacity and a willingness to learn. He hasbeen particularly adaptable at transport driving and simple maintenance, also at light and heavy tractor driving, and he has shown skill in the operationof agricultural and land-clearing equipment. Simple mechanical work ofa repetitive kind is well within his ability, and many Africans have maderapid progress in carpentry and joinery. Naturally, the African has muchto learn, and too many who show early promise fail to stay the course.Problem of &quot; Skilled &quot; Workers280. The chief drawback has been the quality of the &quot; skilled &quot; labour.That drawn from labour exchanges has been getting progressively worse.At Urambo, for example, the performance of skilled labour was, on the whole,rather poor. Jalua and Wakamba tribesmen from Kenya, and the Wasukumatribesmen from Tanganyika, showed the greatest promise. But nowhere canit be said that a skilled African is comparable to a skilled European or askilled Asian.281. Certain types of skilled workers cannot be obtained from among EastAfricans, e.g., superior clerks and technicians such as generator operators,refrigerator repairers, mechanics and carpenters. As the local Indian is not an applicant for employment, the Corporation turned to Mauritius and theSeychelles for this type of labour, and 200 men were obtained. Suchskilled African workers as are available were obtained chiefly fromTanganyika and Kenya. Many offered their services at the doorstep, andthousands of written applications were received. The Labour departments of the Governments of Tanganyika and Kenya rendered great assistance and did all they could to meet the Corporation^ needs.282. Kunda Training Centre [see paras. 311 et seq.] started to turn outpartially trained workers. They are apprenticed to the Corporation for fouryears and as they complete only a six months&apos; course at Ifunda, the onus of on-training rests on the foremen arid supervisors to whom they are posted.Unskilled Labour283. Unskilled labour offered itself in sufficient quantity in all Regions tosatisfy the needs of the Corporation and its Contractors. A severe shortagewas, however, felt by the Contractors engaged in constructing the railway fromMkwaya and Mtwara to Nachingwea, and the Port of Mtwara. The twochief causes of this shortage were: -(a) The African in the Southern Province grows sufficient foodstuffs tomaintain both himself and his family, with a surplus for sale. Hecan, therefore, maintain his standard of living and pay his taxeswithout having to work.(b) The railway construction entails hard manual labour and is unpopular.284. The railway labour position has improved, largely due to a temporaryfood shortage in the Province, improved man-management, and recruitingefforts made by the Corporation.Labour Utilisation285. The utilisation of Labour was far from satisfactory. There is little doubt that the Labour force could have been considerably reduced hadproper utilisation been employed in all Departments. The Corporation hada large number of Europeans working with the Africans who did not know

the language and who had never before worked with Africans. In thesecircumstances, it was obvious that the best was not being got from the african. Instructions were issued to ensure that European employees learnedKi-Swahili, the lingua franca, and some improvements in utilisation were achieved. At the end of March, 1949, the Corporation invited an AfricanLabour expert, Colonel C. V. Merritt, of Kenya, to visit the Regions and advise on methods of Labour utilisation. As a result of his report, a LabourUtilisation Department is being established under the control of a trained and experienced man.African Labour Turnover286. The African unskilled labour turnover for the year has averaged about10 per cent, per month, indicating a complete turnover of labour everyten months. This figure appears excessively high, as indeed it is. against this is the fact that all labour, unless under contract, is entitled to quit atthe end of any one month. Many Africans do so in order to go to their homes to cultivate their own holdings, and many of them return. There isa tendency for Africans throughout East Africa constantly to change their employment and few make a career with any one firm.287. In an attempt to reduce the high wastage an experiment was carriedout in Kongwa Region whereby all labour, both skilled and unskilled, was required to sign a contract of nine months duration. Although the menaccepted employment under these conditions, the experiment proved a failure.Many; particularly among the unskilled labour, did not honour the contract and deserted when they felt so inclined. The experiment was thereforeabandoned.288. The Corporation believes that one practical way to reduce wastageis to offer to Africans good living and working conditions, both for themen and their families.Wage Rates289. There is in Tanganyika Territory no machinery for wage fixing and accordingly wages vary greatly in different parts of the Territory. Forinstance, a labourer in a town such as Dar-es-Salaam obtains a considerably higher wage than a labourer at remote Nachingwea, 100 miles inland fromLindi. The wages paid by the Corporation are in line with those paid bythe Government and leading commercial concerns. Furthermore, the degreeof skill of so-called artisans varies greatly. The vast majority of them,judged by British standards, are no more than learners or, at the best,apprentices. In an attempt to standardise wage rates throughout the project,a system of Classification of trades into groups, and trade testing within eachtrade has been devised. Promotion in any group from one class to anotherentails passing a trade test. As nearly all unskilled labour is obtained locally,it has been found impossible to insist on a standard rate of pay for allRegions and areas. The Provincial Commissioner of the Southern Provincehas established a Wage Rates and Tasks Board with the object ofstandardising wages in his Province, and thus preventing labour continuallyshifting from one employer to another in search of the maximum wage forthe minimum of work. The Corporation^ Regional Managers have authorityto adjust wages for unskilled labour as they consider necessary.Domestic Councils and Works Committees290. The East African worker, and particularly the unskilled field worker,likes his grievances to be heard, discussed and settled on the spot, ratherthan by some distant machinery, of the working of which he is unaware.

291. What has been required for some considerable time has been machinerywhereby all non-European employees, however and wherever employed, canvoice their grievances ; in other words, a Management and Employees Council.The other requirement has been machinery to enable the Africans to settleby arbitration their own affairs such as matrimonial disputes, petty quarrels,etc., and to give them the opportunity of participating in the organisation oftheir lives and recreational pursuits. Two types of council, known as&quot; Domestic Councils &quot; and &quot; Works Committees,&quot; were set up in all units and equivalent centres of activity in the Kongwa and Urambo Regions. TheseCouncils will also be set up in the Southern Province Region.292. Domestic councils are entirely African. Their object is to delegate to Africans responsibility for organising their communal life. The mainfunctions of these councils are to settle domestic differences, to improve thewell-being of the members of each community, and to attempt mediation inall cases of civil differences. They work in close liaison with the Govern-ment African Courts, but do not usurp the latter&apos;s powers.293. Works Committees consist of representatives of Management and men.The former are nominated, the latter elected. The main object is to provide an organised means of consultation between the Administration and the employees.  Functions include:  (a) Co-operation between Units Management and the employees, withthe object of achieving and increasing the efficiency and well-being of the employees.(b) Conditions of service.(c) Settlement of grievances.(d) Physical welfare at places of work.(e) Co-operation with Sports Committees, Welfare Committees, and domestic Councils.294. These Councils and Committees were formed after full consultationwith the Tanganyika Government, and enjoy the support of the Government.They proved a success and had the advantage of making numbers of europeans at all levels take an interest in the affairs of their Africanemployees. At the same time, the African learnt to assume a greater degreeof responsibility for the conduct of his own affairs. In fact, machinery hasnow been set up whereby tribal laws and customs can be replaced by a newcivil and communal responsibility.Other Bodies295. Other Councils in operation were:  (a) Mauritian Staff Councils.(b) The O.F.C. and Associated Companies Asian Employees Associa-tion, which is a registered Trade Union in Dar-es-Salaam.(c) An O.F.C. African Employees Committee in Dar-es-Salaam, whichfunctions similarly to those of a Works Committee.Police Force296. As the Tanganyika Police Force were unable to provide adequate safeguards in the remote areas in which the Corporation operates, it wasconsidered essential to take special measures to protect the Corporation^property against theft and malicious damage and to keep the peace. Inconsequence, an ex-Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Force was engaged to organise a Security Department.

297. On August 7, an Auxiliary Police Force was established by theGovernment of Tanganyika for service in areas occupied by the Corporation.The cost of this Force is wholly borne by the Corporation. The Chief Officerof the Force has a dual responsibility. He is answerable to the governor and Commissioner of Police for the proper functioning of the Force, and is responsible to the Board of the Corporation for the protection of its per-sonnel and property. Every member of the Force is a sworn Constableunder the Ordinance, and is obliged to conform to a Code of Discipline. a police training school was established at Ifunda. The Force numbered nearly200. .298. In December, 1948, an Officer was posted to Urambo and in February,1949, two Officers were posted to the Southern Province, one to NachingweaArea and the other to Mkwaya.299. There is evidence that the Force has done good work, as shown bythe statistics below:  Number ofCases Reported728Number of   Number of        Value of PropertyArrests      Convictions      Stolen       Recovered518 427     Shs. 137,516    Shs. 61,175PART II: CATERING AND SHOPSFood300. It is the policy of the Corporation to feed all its African employees who are in receipt of a monthly wage of Shs. 140 or less. The scale of rations per head recommended by the Tanganlika Government and authorised by the Corporation was as follows:  Maize mealBeansGroundnutsSugar    .......Meat or fish in lieu   .Red palm oil   ...Other vegetable oilsGreen leafy vegetablesSalt       .......24 oz. per day4 oz. ,,2 oz. ,,8 oz. per week2 lb.   ,,    ,,2 oz.   ,,2 oz.   ,,2 lb.   ,,    ,,4 oz. ..301. This scale provides 3,500 calories a day and costs the Corporation18s. 6d. a month.302. These foods were also on sale in the Corporation^ shops to thosewho did not qualify for free rations.303. In Kongwa, communal cooking, organised by the Catering andMerchandise Department, was the practice in the main camps. Ten Euro-pean messes were established, which catered for numbers varying between20 and 150, according to location. There were nine communal feeding points for African workers.304. In Urambo, five European messes were opened during the year, butAfrican communal messing was not started and rations were issued to the africans.  Two European messes were established in Ifunda.

305. The Southern Province presented the greatest difficulty.306. Small supplies of vegetables were grown by the Corporation atNamanga, but these were insufficient to supply everybody. Vegetables were flown in from the Southern Highlands at considerable expense, but these,while giving the Europeans a reasonable ration, allowed only an occasionalallocation to the Africans. A small Corporation vegetable farm at Mahiwahas produced little and transport difficulties complicated distribution. Towardsthe end of the year, African rations improved. Fresh meat was seldomavailable, and tinned meat and dried fish had to take its place. Thiswas of reasonable quality and well-liked. Tinned meat was of the typespecially supplied for use as African rations. In Appendix VI is a report-of the result of a survey of African nutrition made during the year.Shopping Facilities307. The Corporation found itself in control of the shops in existence inthe Kongwa Region and decided instead to transfer the ownership to privatetraders. It is the policy of the Corporation to transfer ownership of all itsremaining shops to private traders and to invite them to open new oneswhere they are found to be necessary. The Corporation is encouraging com-petition and discouraging any attempts at monopoly.308. A mobile shop, operated by the Corporation, served the needs ofthe staff in the bush, while nine African shops catered for the everydayneeds of the men and their families.309. In Urambo, one shop catered for the complete needs of the Euro-pean staff. A shop for Africans was opened in 1948, but owing to the lack of European supervision, stealing was so great that it was closed, andanother and smaller shop in the forward labour camp was opened in its place.310. Towards the end of the year the first European shop was opened inMkwaya and, a little later, one in Nachingwea. Both foodstuffs and merehan-dise were on sale.PART III: EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LIFEThe Ifunda Training Centre311. It has been the aim of the Corporation to ensure that the Projectprovides an outlet for the ambitious and capable African. The great needhas been to obtain skilled and semi-skilled men and to do this the Cor-poration decided to set up its own training centre.312. For this purpose the Corporation took over from the TanganyikaGovernment in June, 1948, a Polish Refugee Camp at Ifunda in the SouthernHighlands. It is somewhat remote from the three groundnut Regions; the camp was built for occupation by individual families, not as a training centre; and capital development will be necessary before the centre isproperly equipped with workshops, bays and stores.313. It was decided to aim at the training of 1,000 artisans per year 100 clerks, 250 civil engineering artisans, and 650 mechanical engineering-artisans. In addition recruits are trained at Ifunda for the Auxiliary police service and for the Hospital and Sanitary Services. The cost of the training-centre is estimated at  80,000 in a full year.

314. All trainees must have passed Std. VI before entry ; they are in-ventured for four years, given six months&apos; training, and sent to Units,workshops, building development areas and offices for further training for\ years. The Tanganyika schools, unfortunately, have failed to send enoughtrainees, and men have been brought to Ifunda from Kenya ; but it is hoped to attract more trainees from Tanganyika, and so to raise the wage-earning capacity of the Territory, which is its primary need in its development programme. It is possible that Government may wish to send students tothe Medical School at Ifunda, as it is the only school of its sort in the Territory.Teaching of Swahili315. The efficient use of native labour is impossible unless the Europeansresponsible for their control are able to speak Swahili. The Corporationtook special measures to encourage the staff to learn the language. Classeswere organised in each Region and each European employee is required topass an elementary examination in Swahili before receiving an increment.European Education316. The arrival of Corporation and Contractors&apos; European staff and then-wives and families created an educational problem which the Governmenteducational system was unable to handle. There is no secondary schoolingin Tanganyika, and children have to be sent to Kenya-at a cost beyondthe pockets of most employees ; there are only two Government primary schools, and these were full and expensive; the only education was of thepreparatory school and public school type, and the boarding school; andmany of the staff wanted day-schools and cheap schools. To meet thispressing human problem, the Corporation agreed to build, equip, staff and administer schools at Kongwa and Urambo, and Government agreed to pay100 per cent, of the recurrent costs of them. The Kongwa School openedon October 1, with a Headmaster and student-teacher recruited from England,assisted by f our * wives resident at Kongwa who have teaching qualifications and experience. The school followed a primary syllabus to 11 -f ; thereafter,the children were divided into three streams, one preparing for the KenyaPreliminary Entrance to secondary schools, one for the School Certificateand one for general education with a technical bias. A European Apprentice-ship Scheme was being considered. The number of children attending rose from 30 to 120 in six months.317. The Urambo School had a similar pattern ; numbers were smaller.T)ut were expected to increase to 120.318. In the Southern Province children, scattered in small groups, used the Tanganyika Governmenfs Schools Correspondence Course ; but all parentswere encouraged to send their children to Government Primary BoardingSchools, and to apply for remission of fees or for bursaries.African Education319. African community and school education could not begin until some measure of stabilisation had been achieved, and this depended on the arrival of families, and so on the building of villages. Urambo, first with its Africanhousing programme, was first with its School. The emphasis was, and willhe, on community rather than school education.320. At Kongwa, a Nissen hut became the African Community Centre;each evening there were lectures in English for English-speaking Africans onsubjects chosen by themselves: Advanced English, Political Science and

Agriculture, and an Art Class. Each evening at a later hour, educated Africansbecame voluntary teachers of some 150 other Africans anxious to learnEnglish, arithmetic, and to read and write. Each member paid 15s. a year,and each class student 3s. There is a library.321. There were three African schools in the Kongwa Region, all of themin tents.322. The Tanganyika Government will pay 90 per cent, of the salary billsof these Corporation African schools, and give a grant to the cost of school buildings. Government African schools are free ; but in all CorporationAfrican schools fees must be paid; and a system of fee-paying new to thecolonies was introduced by reducing the fees as a child passed up the school,until schooling became free ; hard work and merit were thus rewarded, notpenalised. There is some hope that the wastage after the first year or two the curse of African educational systems will be arrested. The schoolsare planned to give four years of primary schooling and four years of practicaleducation in handwork, farming, hygiene and the improvement of home andvillage life.Welfare323. A report made to the Board by the Education and Social ScienceDepartment in May, 1948, strongly emphasised that the separation of welfarefrom general man-management was wrong in principle and socially harmful inpractice; the report recommended, and the Board agreed, that welfare mustbe the responsibility of the Management, of each Head of Department, andof every user of African labour; it was also recommended and agreed thatthere should not be a Welfare Department or a Chief Welfare Officer. Thisfundamental principle of welfare was not successfully applied by all Headsof Departments, and users of African labour.324. This fault is receiving the attention of the Central Management.W.V.S.325. To meet the human needs and problems consequent on the arrival of wives and families at Dar-es-Salaam, Kongwa and Urambo, the Women&apos;sVoluntary Services, at the invitation of the Corporation, sent out a team offive voluntary workers in July. The team did most valuable work in thethree Regions. It prepared for the arrival&apos; of and welcomed wives and families, provided information, acted as escorts, and visited families and Units.The human and welfare side of the Project, so far as Europeans are concerned,owes much to the Women&apos;s Voluntary Services. The experiment of using the Service in this new colonial enterprise was abundantly justified.Social Life326. Social life in the Corporation^ Regions is organised by members of the staffs. The Corporation has been responsible for supplying capital equipment-club houses, tennis courts, open-air cinemas, etc. For example, in Korigwathe Corporation built and furnished a club and presented it to the staff, acommittee of which is responsible for its administration. The club holdsweekly dances, gives gramophone recitals, offers indoor games, and sentesas a meeting place.

327. Cinema performances are presented by the Army KinematographCorporation. Showings take place not less than once a week, at some placestwice a week, and shows are given in the forward areas as well as the bases.No charge is made to the staff for these performances.328. Similar social activities took place on a comparable scale in theSouthern Province.Spiritual Life329. The spiritual needs of the Christian communities were met by theChurch Missionary Society, the Universities&apos; Mission to Central Africa, andby the Roman Catholic Church. In Kongwa, a start was made on the building of a church by members of the staff, who are making themselves responsiblefor all costs.330. On the Units at Kongwa the necessary facilities have been given toAfricans working at catechists and teachers.331. At Urambo contacts with African Christians were made by theMoravian Church, and at Ifunda by the Swedish Mission.332. The Bishop in Central Tanganyika and his chaplains made periodicvisits to Kongwa, Urambo and Ifunda. Similar visits were paid to the southern province areas by Archdeacon Capper, who lives in Lindi.Information Division333. A daily newspaper, the Kongwa Daily News, a roneoed journal of up to eight pages, is published each day by the Information Division andalso a weekly news summary in Swahili. The monthly journal of the overseas food Corporation-&quot; Our World &quot; began publication in East Africa inAugust, 1948. And in February, 1949, the publication of a Swahili monthly &quot; Watangulizi&quot; was( started.  -334. The Information Division is also responsible for the reception and care of visitors.. 335. During the year these included members of the United Nations Trustee-ship Council&apos;s Visiting Mission to Tanganyika, the Rt. Hon. John Strachey.M.P.; Mr. D. R. Rees-Williams, M.P.; Mr. Anthony Hurd, M.P.; Mr. J.Henderson Stewart, M.P.; Mr. R. S. Hudson, M.P.; Earl de la Warr; Mr.John Hare, M.P.; Dr. Mont Follick, M.P.; Mr. W. T. Proctor, M.P.; MM.P. Coleno and M. Rossin of the French Colonial Office (Agricultural Depart-ment); M. Pierre Staner, Director of Agriculture, Belgian Colonial Office;Dr. Bredo (International Locust Control); Mr. G. F. Clay, AgriculturalAdviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies ; Dr. C. G. Trapnell,Government Ecologist, N. Rhodesia ; Sir William Gavin ; Colonel E. S.Grogan ; Mr. Julian D. Marks, Chairman, United Premier .Oil Cake Co.;Professor G. E. Blackman ; a Parliamentary Delegation consisting of Mr.J. B. Hynd, M.P., Mr. G. McAllister, M.P., Mr. W. H. Mainwaring, M.P..Brigadier Prior-Palmer, M.P., Mr. A. H. Skeffington, M.P., and Major S.Wingfield Digby, M.P.; and technicians and journalists, broadcasters and newsreel representatives from Great Britain, South Africa, the United States ofAmerica, France, Belgium and Holland.336. A film unit from &quot; This Modern Age &quot; a J. Arthur Rank organisa-tion made a commercial film of the Groundnuts Scheme &quot; Harvest fromthe Wilderness,&quot; which was released in Britain in December.

PART IV: HEALTH337. One of the problems with which the Corporation has been faced isthat of maintaining the health of its employees, and the most careful attention has been paid to services for preventing and dealing with sickness and disease.338. On the whole the health of Europeans and Africans has been good.There have been small outbreaks of epidemics, such as typhoid, amoebicdysentry, but none reached any serious proportions.339. There is no doubt that modern insecticides have saved a tremendousamount of sickness. No one will be able to calculate what the Corporationowes to these preparations, for whereas the standards of hygiene have beenpoor, the degree of fly infestation has been remarkably low in most areas.340. A table showing incidence of disease is in Appendix VI (1).THE   HEALTH   SERVICE341. The organisation of the health service was divided into two sectionsunder the direction of a Headquarters in Kongwa which was responsible for advising the Management on policy.Preventive Medicine342. The first endeavour of the Health Service was to prevent illness inspite of the risks to which workers were exposed. This preventive service was controlled in each Region by the Regional Health Officer or medical officer of Health responsible for advising the Area or Regional Managerin local health matters outside the hospital, and for carrying out such preven-tive medicine measures in the area as require medical knowledge and equip-ment. The Regional Health Officer was also responsible for the supervision and control of unit health centres within the area.343. The staff of the Regional Health Officer depended on the size and difficulties that have been encountered, but has consisted of British HealthInspectors and Health Visitors who were responsible for the supervision ofall technical preventive medicine measures, such as malaria control, tsetsecontrol, the inspection of dwelling places and workshops. They were helped by a number of African Health Assistants whose duties lay chiefly in the inspection of African dwelling quarters, African sanitation, tsetse, rodentand malaria control, water and spraying duties.344. The regional health staff undertook nutritional surveys, and organisedsystems of town cleansing, etc., the regional health office were responsiblefor the provision and distribution of insecticides and other hygiene appliancesfor the use of the general population.Diseases Various345. Respiratory diseases have been the biggest single disease throughoutthe year, as the table in Appendix VI (1) shows. Although living conditions and general sanitation have not been fully satisfactory, preventive medicineservices have been active and no considerable outbreak of disease has occurred.In Kongwa, two cases of typhoid, one in an Asian, and one in an African,

occurred in April, and a further fourteen African cases in August. No furthercases occurred, and no other sources of infection could be traced, thoughone European case was diagnosed in September. Kongwa also suffered froman outbreak of minor infectious disease in September, there being 300 casesof chickenpox and 250 cases of mumps among Africans.Malaria346. Malaria has not been a problem in Kongwa or Urambo. In theSouthern Province, as was expected, with the heavier rainfall, and a longermosquito-breeding season, there has been a higher rate of infection than inthe other Regions. Malarious areas round all of the camps have beencontrolled by the Regional Health Officer, and, in spite of considerable laxityon the part of the European population in taking paludrine and adoptingpersonal anti-malarial precautions, the incidence has not been heavy.Smallpox347. Routine vaccination of all was carried out, and although there ismuch smallpox in the Southern Province, very few cases occurred in Cor-poration personnel.Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness)348. This disease has not been contracted by any European or African inany of the Regions.Amoebic Dysentery349. There were two outbreaks of amoebic dysentery in Kongwa, one inJuly and August, when 13 people were infected, and the other during Novem-ber and March, when 20 people were infected.Hospitals350. Equal in importance to the preventive service was the care of the sick and injured. It was not easy to provide sufficient hospital accommoda-tion, and the existing hospitals, housed mainly in tents, were at times over-crowded.(i) Accommodation351. On April 1,1948, three hospitals were in existence at Kongwa, Uramboand Nachingwea, with beds for 19 Europeans and 247 non-Europeans.  by march 31, 1949, two more hospitals had been established at Mkwaya andIfunda, and accommodation had considerably increased, the number of bedsavailable being as follows:  Hospital	European	Non-European	TotalsKongwa     .........	46	260	306Urambo      ......	12	114	126Nachingwea.........	26	96	122Mkwaya     .........	24	76	100Ifunda         .......	8	30	38Totals ...	116	576	692352. The above figures are for beds already equipped; but accommoda-tion was completed for a total of 930 hospital beds in the whole territory ofthe Scheme. The new Kongwa hospital which opened in March, 1949, pro-vided better conditions for the treatment of prolonged illness, serious

3120operations and nursing in a cooler climate, and cases were referred fromother Regions so that the bulk of major investigations and treatment wereperformed at Kongwa. The other hospitals were housed mainly in E.P.I.P.tents or more recently in hospital extending marquees, ex-Army stock, withconcrete floors, and with electric light and water laid on.353. The Corporation^ hospitals provided a service to thousands of africans who are not employed by the Corporation or by any of the Con-tractors. Together with their families they flocked for treatment, and itwas impossible to deny it to them. Upwards of 800 a week applied for treatment men, women and children some of whom walked 100 miles inthe hope of being cured. During the year the Kongwa hospital was treating425 a week. Payment for treatment was virtually impossible to collect. the Tanganyika Government is discussing with the Corporation the possibilityof making a token payment towards the cost of meeting this service to thesenon-employed Africans.354. Since March, 1949, the building of bandas or rondavals for staffquarters has gone ahead in all areas. The hardship of night sisters attempting to sleep in the day in hot tents is about to be eliminated everywhere.(ii) Staff355. The Hospitals were staffed by European Doctors, Sisters andTechnicians assisted by African Orderlies. There were Surgical and MedicalSpecialists at Kongwa and in the Southern Province, and a Pathologist andOphthalmologist as Scheme Specialists at Kongwa. The European Staffincreased from 50 to 101 by the end of the year.(iii) Admission Rates and Treatment356. See Tables Appendix VI, 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c).Ophthalmic Services357. An ophthalmologist was appointed during the year. He has been based at Kongwa, but has visited all areas on a monthly basis, for consulta-tive work and refractions.Other details are in Appendix VI (4).Dental services358. Two Dental Surgeons, one located at Kongwa and the other atNachingwea, have operated throughout the year. Shortages of dental equip-ment have occasioned some delay in providing treatment.359. Urambo and Ifunda were visited periodically by the Dental Surgeon at kongwa, while Mkwaya was visited by the Dental Surgeon at Nachingwea.360. A dental laboratory with a European Dental Technician was estab-lished at Kongwa for the manufacture of all dental appliances.Dental Statistics361. These are given in Appendix VI (4).X-ray Services362. Details and statistics are in Appendix VI (5).Consultant Work363. With the arrival of more staff, more time was spent in purely con-6ultant work.  It was possible to visit all the Regions.

121Laboratory and Research Work364. A laboratory service, headed by the Pathologist to the Scheme, was established in connection with each hospital, but those attached to the tem-porary hospitals were naturally not on the same scale as the new KongwaCentral Training Laboratory which was occupied in March, 1949. (SeeAppendix VI (7).)Staff365. Four European technicians were employed, two of them Fellows ofthe Institute of Laboratory Technology.366. There were eleven African Laboratory Assistants under training.Seven were stationed at Kongwa, one at Urambo, one at Mkwaya and twoat Nachingwea.367. The laboratory service was the largest employer in the corporation of the more highly educated Tanganyikan.Special Surveys368. Special surveys were carried&apos; out, dealing with Tuberculosis andNutrition.Reports on these appear in Appendix VI, 6 (a), (b).Malarial Surveys369. Malarial surveys were carried out by the Pathologist in co-operationwith the resident medical staff in Kongwa, Nachingwea, Mkwaya and at Ruo,Mtama and Nanganga.Surgery370. A great amount of work was done, some details of which are inAppendix VI (8).

CHAPTER 5FINANCE AND ACCOUNTS371. At the time the Overseas Food Corporation took control, over 7,000,000 had already been spent and expenditure was continuing at an increasing rate. The accounts organisations of both the Managing agency and many of its Contractors were unequal to the heavy demands made on them.372. After a review of the situation it became apparent that immediate action was required, especially in the following directions:  (a) to introduce a proper accounts system, capable of providing the regional Managers, the Central Management in East Africa,and the Board in London with the accounting information requiredfor the administration of the Corporation ;(b) to recruit staff of the right calibre and in adequate numbers to clear up the backlog, to keep abreast of the current work, to introduce the new accounts system, and to ensure its continued efficientoperation;(c) to set up an Internal Audit Department, whose main function inthe early stages would be to audit. the Contractors&apos; books andcontrol their expenditure ; and(d) to set up a financial control of expenditure.East African Accounts373. In July, 1947, Cooper Brothers &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, hadbeen commissioned to examine the operations of the Groundnuts Scheme andto recommend what system of accounts should be adopted. They carriedout an extensive investigation and in February, 1948, submitted their report and recommendations. .374. Owing to the shortage of staff it was not found possible to introduceimmediately these recommendations whereby decentralised accounting organi-sations were to be set up in each Region.375. The shortage of experienced accountants made recruitment slow andit was only towards the end of the year that the necessary complement of staff was available in East African376. To facilitate disposing of the arrears of work caused by lack of staff and to expedite the preparation of the Balance Sheet at March 31, 1949, itwas decided to centralise the Regional accounts and to defer adopting therecommendation made by Cooper Bothers &amp; Co. for a decentralised systemof accounts.377. This centralisation has been carried out and the arrears are beingeliminated.London Accounts378. The Accounts Department in London had virtually to be created.This was not due to any omission on the part of the Managing Agency,but to the fact that during their period of control the bulk of accountingwork was done for them by their parent company, the United Africa Co.Limited.

379. The relationship between the Accounts Department in Londonand the Accounts Department in East Africa is that of most London Depart-ments and their corresponding Departments overseas. The Corporation^ ChiefAccountant in East Africa is not responsible to his opposite number inLondon, but, through the Controller of Finance, to the East African Manage-ment and through it to the Board in London.Audit380. When the Corporation took over, no Internal Audit Department wasin existence in East Africa. This was because the Internal Audit Divisionof the Ministry of Food had been carrying out these duties for the ManagingAgency to February 29, 1948, and no independent Audit Department hadbeen set up.381. For this department too, recruiting was difficult and it was not finallyset up until September, 1948. Its main function was to audit the Contractors&apos;accounts and generally to supervise their expenditure. While responsible in general to the Controller of Finance in East Africa, the Chief InternalAuditor has direct access to the Board, to which copies of all his reports are sent.382. The Minister of Food appointed Messrs. Cooper Brothers &amp; Co.,Chartered Accountants, as Auditors to the Corporation for the period from march 1, 1948 to March 31, 1949, in accordance with the provisions ofSection 16 (3) of the Overseas Resources Development Act, 1948.Financial Control383. It is the Corporation^ policy to exercise financial control by a Budgetapproved by the Board and the implementation of which is the responsibilityof the East African Central Management. Complete budgetary controldepends on an accounts organisation capable of producing detailed returns of actual expenditure. It therefore had to wait until the accounts situation had been rectified. Nevertheless, for the purpose of making financial esti-mates of the Corporation^ future requirements, Budget offices were opened in London and East Africa, whose responsibilities included the production offinancial plans and the ad hoc critical examination of major items of expendi-ture or proposed expenditure.384. The Budget Office in London was set up in April, 1948, and that in east Africa in May, 1948.385. While East Africa has been able at all times to obtain financialdirection and advice from the Board and the London Office, it was obviouslynecessary to have available in East Africa at the Central Management level,an officer capable of dealing With the numerous and frequent financial ques-tions which could not, and indeed should not, be referred to London. Thepost of Controller of Finance was therefore created. The Controller is amember of the Central Management in East Africa.386. Early in 1949, a Budget was produced for the financial year ending march 31, 1950, and was approved by the Board. It was put into operation on April 1, 1949.Queensland-British Food Corporation387. The Balance Sheet as at March 31, 1949, and Accounts of theQueensland-British Food Corporation, are contained in the report of its activities which appears in Appendix I.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO BE READ INCONJUNCTION WITH THE BALANCE SHEETGENERALNote 1The Accounts for the period from the inception of the Scheme to february-ary 29, 1948, were the responsibility of the United Africa Company (ManagingAgency) Ltd., and were submitted by them to the Ministry of Food onMarch 7, 1949. A copy of the Balance Sheet at February 29, 1948, and the managing Agency&apos;s Report thereon is attached. (See Schedule IV.)The conditions obtaining at the beginning of the period are described in that report, and those obtaining throughout the period are described in Chapter Vof this report.As a result of these conditions, the Corporation and some of its Con-tractors did not find it possible to maintain for all aspects of their operations the proper books of account that are necessary to give a true and fair viewof the state of the Corporation^ affairs, and to explain its transactions.Note 2. Rates of ExchangeEast African and Australian currencies have been converted at the ratesruling at the date of the Balance Sheet.FIXED ASSETSNote 3. Title Deeds to Land in East africa the Corporation is in negotiation with the Tanganyika Government andthe Colonial Office on the details of Land Leases. (See para. 53 of thegeneral report.)Note 4. Buildings and InstallationsIt was decided to carry out a revaluation of these assets, because (a), their cost was inflated by exceptional expenditure incurred in initiating a newventure of this character, and (b), it has proved impossible to record actualcosts.The basis of the valuation, which has been agreed with the Contractorsconcerned, is the estimated cost of erecting these assets by contract under normal conditions in East Africa computed by reference to the cost oflabour, materials and overhead charges ruling at the time the valuationwas made.At the date of the Balance Sheet, the revaluation had been completed forKONGWA, URAMBO, DAR-ES-SALAAM, IFUNDA and NAIROBI.The Corporation is of the opinion that this valuation will form the basis for a proper charge for depreciation in this and future years.As regards the Accounts now under review, depreciation has been written off the valuation figures from the date on which the particular building orinstallation was completed at rates which are considered to be sufficient toextinguish the cost of the assets over their expected life.The difference between the total of the valuation and the total cost asfurnished by the Contractors has been transferred to &quot; Development, Land-Clearing and Agricultural Expenditure.&quot;

Note 5The valuation in the SOUTHERN PROVINCE could not be completed intime for inclusion in the Balance Sheet. Buildings and installations for this region have, therefore, been shown at the cost of erection according to the books of the Contractors concerned. For the reasons given in Note 1, theallocation of costs made by the Contractors to these assets is arbitrary ;however, a valuation will be completed in the year ending March 31, 1950, inaccordance with the principles adopted in other Regions.Note 6. Plant, Machinery and VehiclesA census of these assets has been taken throughout all the areas of opera-tions in East Africa. The assets so disclosed have been valued at the landedcost in East Africa, or where the landed costs were not available at estimatedlanded costs.The valuation showed a deficit over the recorded costs which has beentransferred to &quot; Development, Land-Clearing and Agricultural Expenditure.&quot;Note 7.   Furniture and Office EquipmentThe gross figure in the Balance Sheet is made up as follows :  -  (a) London Office furniture and equipment at cost ...       26,364(b) East African furniture and office equipment atcost, as recorded in the books ...      ...      ...     423,932 450,296For the reasons set out in Note 1 full information regarding the value of east African furniture and office equipment was not available, and cannotbe made, available until an inventory has been completed.A provision for depreciation of  51,139 has been made representing:  (a)  1,139 for London Office furniture and equipment.(b)  50,000 for East Africa furniture and office equipment.Note 8. Development, Land-Clearing and Agricultural ExpenditureSince the Corporation&apos;^ activities are still largely in the development stage,all expenditure of a Revenue nature, and such expenditure on Capital Accountas has not been allocated to individual assets, has been charged to this account.These charges include the cost of Land-Clearing, and when adequateexperience of this operation in East Africa has been obtained an appro-priate transfer will be made to a Land-Clearing Account.CURRENT  ASSETSNote 9. Expenditure recoverable from East African Railways and HarboursThis represents the cost to the Corporation of the work carried out on thenew harbour at MTWARA, the railway line in the SOUTHERN PROVINCE,and the branch from the Central Line to KONGWA.These assets are to be taken over by East African Railways and Harbours.

Note 10. stocks for the reasons set out in the general note on the Accounts, full records of the movement of stocks of stores and materials were not maintained.A physical count of all stocks in East Africa was undertaken during March,1949.Stocks in East Africa have been valued at landed cost, estimated cost or local purchase price together with an estimated addition, in certain cases,to cover handling charges at port and up-country freight.The value of the stocks issued has been arrived at by deducting the valueof the stocks in hand at March 31, 1949, from the aggregate of the stocks in hand at February 29, 1948 (as described in the notes attached to the february 29, 1948, Accounts) and the cost of shipments received and localpurchases made since that date, together with landing charges and up-countryfreight.The available records of issues for use on Capital works either to Con-tractors or the Corporation^ own departments and issues for sale to outsideparties have been evaluated and the &quot;appropriate charges made. The balanceof  2,542,360 has been charged to &quot; Development, Land-Clearing and Agri-cultural Expenditure&quot; ; this sum covers stores consumed, losses due towastage or pilferage and the writing down of unserviceable material.Stocks in the United Kingdom and in transit have been valued at cost.Note 11.   Cultivation in ProgressThe value of growing crops has been calculated on the basis of the esti-mated crop valued at selling price agreed with the Ministry of Food, less theestimated cost of harvesting and selling..    CURRENT  LIABILITIESNote 12.   CommitmentsThe Corporation has commitments on contracts and orders outstandingamounting to approximately  2,000,000. In addition, there are commit-ments under existing contracts for the feature delivery of goods and services.These commitments, which are considerable, are largely in respect of work tobe carried out as directed from time to time on a cost plus fee basis and thefinancial commitment cannot, therefore, be assessed.The Corporation is a contributor with the Queensland Government underthe Queensland British Food Production Act, 1948, to the financing of theQueensland British Food Corporation.Note 13. Interest on Advances from the Minister of food the advances by the Minister of Food, made under Section 12 (1) of the overseas Resources Development Act, 1948.. are repayable by annuities com-mencing at a date to be agreed after the end of a development period. Therate of interest to be used in computing the annuity repayments has still tobe settled.   No provision has been made for interest in these accounts.

SCHEDULE IVC. F. Huntley, Esq., March 7, 1949.Ministry of Food,Montagu House,Whitehall, S.W.1.Dear Sir,In submitting the accounts of the East African Groundnut Scheme covering the period from inception to February 29, 1948, we have the following com-ments to offer:-Conditions in East Africa, and the speed and nature &apos;of these operations,considerably handicapped the keeping of detailed records. Despite everyeffort to do so, it was not possible under the circumstances to compile acomplete inventory at. February 29. It is considered, however, having regardto the inventories which were compiled and subsequent checks, that the fixed and Current Assets shown on the Balance Sheet were in existenceat February 29.It was impossible to carry out an expert examination of each individualAsset and therefore no write-off has been made to cover depreciation,deterioration or other wastage except in the specific cases mentioned below..In our view, having regard to service conditions in East Africa, the appli-cation of normal commercial depreciation rates might be misleading, especially as second-hand material constitutes a large part of the Assets.No provision has been made in, or note made on, the accounts in respectof commitments under existing contracts for the future delivery of goods or services. These commitments, which are considerable, are largely in respectof work to be carried out as directed from time to time on a Cost plus Feebasis, and the financial commitment cannot therefore be assessed.The following notes are in further explanaton of the figures shown: -Note 1. Development of Land, Buildings and Installations at Cost(a) In the absence of a fully developed costing system, it has been impossible to allocate many of the general expenses to the in-dividual assets produced and these expenses have therefore beengrouped with the Overhead and General Administration expensesincluded in Schedule 1.(b) The deficiencies as detailed at the foot of Schedule 1, have been included in Development Expenditure as they represent lossesinseparable from the launching of a pioneering venture of this nature. The basis of valuation of these deficiencies is explainedelsewhere.(c) The items, Land Clearing, Roads, Buildings and Installations, OilPipeline, Water Supplies and Landing Grounds shown on the face of the Balance Sheet are Prime Costs in so far as these have been allocated.Note 2. Tractors, Vehicles, Machinery and Equipment at cost for the reasons given above, no attempt has been made to reflect the condition of these assets in the figures given and landed cost in EastAfrica has been retained as the basis, and, apart from items in transitand awaiting shipment valued at cost, the basis landed cost in EastAfrica has been used.

Note 3. Stocks(a) General. Although physical stocktaking was not complete in every respect, such a wide field was covered that it has been possibleto assess with reasonable accuracy the cost of stores consumed butnot allocated, and general stores deficiencies at  216,926, whichfigure has been included under Development Expenditure onSchedule 1. The basis of valuation of the inventories for thispurpose was cost, or if it was not possible to identify the costdue to lack of full documentation, an estimate of cost was made.Subject to (6), (c), (d), and (e) below, no financial provision waspossible to cover loss of physical condition.(b) Merchandise. Stocks of merchandise held for re-sale have beenvalued at cost less  20,000 provided for loss of condition. This 20,000 has been added to the deficiency on trading of  30,381and transferred to Development Expenditure.(c) Fertiliser. Fertiliser stocks held in East Africa have been reducedto 10 per cent, below cost to cover estimated wastage and Fertiliserstocks in Holland have been reduced by  30,000 to bring these to market value. This total write-off of  53,920 has been transferredto Development Expenditure.(d) Empty Drums. The stock of empty drums in use in East Africahas been valued at half cost and the amount written off has beentransferred to Development Expenditure.(e) Seed. Groundnut seed held in stock at February 29 and sold sub-sequently has been valued at the sum realised.Note A. DebtorsA provision of  6,250 has been made in respect of Debts due fromemployees or ex-emplbyees, which may not be recoverable. Other debtorsare believed to be good.Yours faithfully,For United Africa Company (Managing Agency) Ltd.,(Signed)     G. W. Webster, Director.

Their advisers pointed out that world food production is relatively stationary, while demand has increased considerably due to the rapid growth of world population. Unless active steps are taken to increase the supplyof food it will not be possible to maintain existing rations of food, let alone makethe necessary improvements, in food standards that many countries urgently requireand that are most desirable in every country seeking an improved standard ofliving generally.Unlike the situation after the first world war, there are not now available hugetracts of easily cultivated land in temperate zones, such as were developed inthe 1920&apos;s in North and South America and Australia. It therefore has becomemost important to find additional large areas for food production, which mustnecessarily be sought outside the cooler temperate regions used for growing wintercereals.The Government of the United Kingdom, for these reasons, set up and financedthe Overseas Food Corporation, which is now embarked on a very large-scaleproject for growing groundnuts (peanuts) and other oil seed crops in East Africa.The Government of Queensland has been most anxious to develop&apos; areassuitable for growing agricultural crops on a predominantly summer rainfull suchas experienced over most of the State. The Government therefore invited a delegation from the Overseas Food Corporation to visit Queensland in order tosee areas that it was thought could be rapidly developed to provide additionalfood for the British people.t

143initial InvestigationsA delegation consisting of Messrs. L. A. Plummer and A. J. Wakefield, ofthe Overseas Food Corporation, and Mr; F. Hollins of the United KingdomMinistry of Food, visited Australia in. January, 1948. After preliminary discus-sions with Commonwealth Government representatives the delegation came toQueensland at the end of January.  .The primary purpose of the delegation was to find, if possible, additional large areas suitable for peanut production, owing to the very high oil and proteinyield of this crop per acre. Discussions with Queensland Government officers,and a charter flight through various districts, convinced them that no suitablepeanut areas were available in Queensland except those which require substantialclearing. The Overseas Food Corporation did not at this date wish to undertakesuch work in Queensland or elsewhere in Australia as the East African project was using all available heavy clearing equipment.However, the delegation was also interested in the production of fodder grainsthat could be used for meat and. fat production. They visited the grain areasof the Darling Downs, as guests of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock (Hon.H. H. Collins, M.L.A.), accompanied by the Co-coordinator-General of PublicWorks. Here they were able to see land developed for grain growing and alsoland of similar quality undeveloped thus giving them a yardstick by which to measure other areas of suitable soil and somewhat similar rainfall conditions.The open downs grasslands in Central West Queensland, occurring betweenRolleston and Clermont, appeared the most suitable of these other areas forthe production of grain sorghum, which could be used either for pig productionin Queensland and/or for export to Great Britain, and for sunflower and possiblyother oilseed production.After their return from a ground inspection trip early in February discussions were arranged by the Co-coordinator-General of Public Works between the membersof the delegation and leading experts in land utilisation, grain and animal produc-tion, soil erosion and allied matters, from the Department of Agriculture and Stock,the Department of Public Lands, the Bureau of Industry, and the Bureau of investigation of Land and Water Resources.These discussions covered all aspects of the problem, including suitability ofclimate, methods of cultivation, costs of production, transport and other require-ments for such a large-scale farming undertaking.Decision to start activities in QueenslandThe delegation had full discussions with the Premier of Queensland, and both parties were satisfied with the prospects of success of such an undertaking. OnFebruary 25, 1948, the Premier, on behalf of the Queensland Government, andthe representatives of the Overseas Food Corporation, signed a tentative agree-ment covering the following points:A joint authority would be formed, consisting of representatives of the Over-seas Food Corporation and of the Queensland Government. This authority would be created by statute, with power to operate the undertaking.The Queensland Government would supply one-quarter of the capital required,up to a limit of  500,000, and the balance would be supplied by the overseas food Corporation.Representation on the new authority would be on the basis of capital supplied.It was proposed by Mr. L. A. Plummer, Chairman of the Overseas food corporation, that he should be Chairman, and that Mr. J. R. Kemp, QueenslandCo-coordinator-General of Public Works, should be Vice-chairman.The Queensland Government would acquire suitable land and lease it to thenew authority.The target would be set at 250,000 acres for cultivation. An effort would be madeto get at least 20,000 acres under crop for the next year.Immediately on authority being given, Mr. Kemp would co-opt the servicesof officers of State Departments in order to start the work of cultivation.

Cultivation would be done by large-scale, scientific methods of agriculture.For the first few years sorghum would be the main crop grown, and this wouldbe used in conjunction with green feed and other protein rations for fatteningpigs in Central Queensland, surplus grain production being available for export to Britain as feeding stuffs. Sunflowers would also be grown as an oilseed forexport to Britain.Personnel to operate the scheme would come from Queensland and the UnitedKingdom, preferably suitable farm workers and ex-servicemen. Not later than seven years after the establishment of the undertaking a review would be madeas to whether the undertaking should continue, or whether it should be con-verted into a co-operative undertaking, or in the case of tihe grain farms, intoindividual holdings. In the latter case preference would be given to employees of the undertaking.Action taken prior to the establishment of the corporation in order that no time should be lost, and in accordance with the tentativeagreement, the Co-coordinator-General of Public Works immediately initiated actionalong a number of lines:A survey party of experts in agriculture and land visited the Central Westarea and made a close inspection of the Peak Downs property, and an inspection of certain other properties. A valuer from the Valuer-General&apos;s Departmentvalued the Peak Downs property. The Lands Department obtained firm offersfor several potentially suitable freehold properties.Main Roads Commission officers inspected the area and reported on roadwork necessary for its development as farming land.The Co-coordinator-General and Mr. Hollins of the United Kingdom Ministryof Food consulted with the Parliamentary Draftsman concerning his drawing upof suitable legislation.The nucleus of an administrative office of the scheme was set up in Brisbane,and a small staff engaged, with two senior officers seconded from the StateGovernment Service.Orders were placed for farm machinery necessary for the first season&apos;operations.Discussions were commenced with a large contracting firm with a view toan early start to ploughing.The Chairman of the Overseas Food Corporation was continuously consulted about the above lines of action.Legislation setting up the CorporationA Bill was introduced by the Honourable the Premier (Mr. E. M. Hanlon)into the State Parliament on March 24, 1948, and passed all stages on thatdate.Royal Assent was given on April 2, 1948, and the Act is known as &quot;TheQueensland-British Food Production Act&quot;. A summary of the chief provisionsof the Act is as follows :The Act provides for the Development and Extension of Primary industries by establishing a Corporation (The Queensland-British Food Corporation), havingthe general duty of securing the production, processing and marketing of food-stuffs, and in particular the special duty of increasing the supply thereof to theUnited Kingdom.The Corporation shall consist of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman, and eitherfour or seven other members appointed by the Governor in Council, holdingoffice for a term not exceeding seven years, two-thirds of whom shall be nomineesof the Overseas Food Corporation. The Corporation shall be a body corporateand may set up its organisation. The Corporation may determine salaries and wages of its officers and employees, subject to applicable Industrial Awards.The Corporation shall be charged with the duty of carrying out projects forthe production, processing and marketing of foodstuffs, and may carry on allactivities which appear to them requisite in this connection.

i145The Corporation shall publish a full report at the end of each financial year.The Corporation shall establish a reserve fund.The Corporation shall keep proper accounts conforming with the best com-mercial standards, and auditors shall he appointed by the Corporation with theapproval of the Auditor-General.Superannuation funds may be established.All lands other than Crown Lands which are required for the activities of theCorporation may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, be resumed and acquired by the Co-coordinator-General, under the provisions of the StateDevelopment and Public Works Organisation Acts, 1938-40, from the owners.Such land shall vest in the Crown, but all costs of acquiring such land shallbe paid by the Corporation, and the lease shall be granted at a peppercorn rental.Crown Lands required shall be leased to the Corporation.The Corporation may borrow sums required by them for meeting any of their obligations or discharging any of their functions, including initial expenses and provision of working capital. The Corporation may borrow from the overseas food Corporation, and, subject to appropriation by Parliament from theTreasurer, or in. any other manner agreed upon between the Minister and the-Overseas Food Corporation. The Treasurer may make advances to the Cor-poration up to one-third of the aggregate sum outstanding at that time in respectof advances made to the Corporation by the Overseas Food Corporation; or 500,000, whichever is the less.The Corporation shall repay to the Treasurer or to the Overseas Food Cor-poration advances made to the Corporation, and shall pay interest on advancesoutstanding.The Minister and the Overseas Food Corporation may enter into agreementsdesirable for the performance of the duties of the Corporation, such as sharefarming, leasing of land, subdivision of land and establishing a Co-operative society to take over its duties.Any person holding office under any other Act may be appointed a memberof the Corporation, or with the approval of the Governor in Council be employedby the Corporation.The Corporation is not exempt from liability for any tax, duty, rate, levy-or any other charge whatsoever.The Governor in Council may make regulations as he deems necessary forthe purpose of carrying this Act into execution.Establishment of the corporation the Governor in Council, on April 8, 1948, appointed the following membersof the Corporation, thus establishing the Corporation from this date:L. A. Plummer, Chairman; Overseas Food Corporation nominee.J. R. Kemp, Deputy Chairman; Queensland Government nominee.J. Rosa, Member; Overseas Food Corporation nominee.R. E. Hewat, Member; Overseas Food Corporation nominee.G. H. Rushworth, Member; Overseas Food Corporation nominee.E. A. Crosser, Member; Queensland Government nominee.Following his appointment as Auditor-General Mr. A. E. Crosser resigned hismembership of the Corporation as from December 31, 1948. Mr. R. L. Murray,Under-Secretary to the Queensland Treasury, was appointed in his stead.The Corporation has had seven meetings during the year, the inaugural meetingtaking place on April 30, 1948.staff the staff of the Corporation originally consisted of Mr. W. A. Rogers, B.Com.,A.A.U.Q., A.F.I.A., Secretary to the Co-coordinator-General&apos;s Department, andMr. H. W. Herbert, k.D.A., Economist, Bureau of Industry, who were secondedfrom the State Government Service.

Subsequently these officers resigned from the State Service and were appointedAdministrative Manager and Assistant Administrative Manager of the Corporationrespectively.Mr. W. J. Young, A.M.I.E.(Aust.), Commissioner, State Housing Commission,was seconded shortly after for duty, and he also subsequently resigned from theState Service, and is now General Field Manager of the Corporation.Mr. C. J. McKeon, Q.D.A., State Director of Agriculture, was appointed FoodProduction Manager, being still on secondment from the State Public Service.Mr. J. A. B. Saxelby, Q.D.S., a prominent pig breeder, was secured as theCorporation^ Chief Pig Officer.Mr. V. H. Wettenhall, one of the best-known sheep and cattle men in Queens-land, will shortly take up duties as Stock Manager. In the meantime he is acting in certain directions for the Corporation, by kind permission of his principals,Messrs. Taylor Bros. At March 31 there were 27 employees on the staff of theCorporation in Brisbane and in the field. This figure does not include wagesemployees.Acquisition of property for grain production the freehold pastoral property known as Peak Downs, adjoining the Emerald-Blair Athol Railway and the Inland Defence Road, near Capella, in the CentralWestern District, was the first area resumed by the Government for the use of theCorporation. The property, which comprises 92,596 acres, fenced and improvedfor pastoral purposes, was secured for  86,000, including fixed assets and plant.The price was negotiated with the owners prior to actual resumption.Shortly afterwards two further properties were resumed: Cullin-la-Ringo, anaggregation of 118,089 acres, largely freehold, immediately to the west of therailway from Emerald to Springsure, and the Inderi section of Meteor Downs, an area of 51,372 acres, also largely freehold, located just off the Springsure-RollestonRoad. Terms of acquisition have been settled for a further property, Wolfang, an area of 52,208 acres, near Clermont, and resumption will take place shortly.All of the above properties have been obtained, by negotiation prior to resump-tion, at prices, including plant and improvements, well below  1 an acre.It is estimated that they contain altogether some 180,000 acres of arable land the balance (plus stubbles from grain crops) will be available for grazing.To fulfil the target of 250,000 acres under crop each year substantial further,areas are required, and active negotiations are now proceeding aimed at theacquisition of several other large holdings situated in the Central Western area.Agricultural operationsA preliminary target of 20,000 acres under crop at Peak Downs was set for the1948-49 season. The Corporation^ own tractor requirements were not immediately in sight, but a number of ploughs were available, and a contract was made with messrs. Thiess Bros. (Q&apos;land) Pty. Ltd., large earth-moving and road contractors,for ploughing on the basis of the Corporation supplying the ploughs and the firm tractors and men. Thiess Bros, quickly moved three heavy diesel tractorsto the site, and prepared hitching gear to enable each tractor to pull severalploughs.The contract was on the basis of 7s. 6d. per acre for a preliminary area of5,000 acres, the price to be adjusted in the light of experience gained duringoperations. Ploughing commenced on May 22, 1948, and after the first 5,000acres had been done two further contracts were awarded, the area finally com-pleted by the firm amounting to 30,498 acres.The work was finished on October 29, 1948, the average contract price per acre working out at 8s. 6d.During the progress of operations the. Corporation^ own tractors arrivedand were employed in cultivating to remove weed growth. In addition the Cor-poration itself ploughed a further area of 907 acres with its own -machinery,,making a total area ploughed of 31,405 acres.

Moderate early and midwinter rains had fallen on the property and as the weather warmed up during spring a fairly heavy weed growth occurred on the areajust ploughed. The spring was exceptionally dry, enabling this weed growth tobe successfully dealt with. The hot, dry spring broke in mid-November resulting in falls from 60 to 160 points over the property. This caused germination ofmore weeds, which were removed by further cultivation. While there were lightfalls in late November and December there was insufficient rain to permit thecommencement of seeding although everything was in complete readiness forthe operation.It is interesting to note that, until seeding rains fell in mid-January the summerwas one of the driest ever experienced on Peak Downs over the period of rainfallrecords (60 years). However, up to two inches of rain fell in mid-January, and thedecision was made to commence planting. The Corporation undertook theoperation itself with its own plant and workmen. The operation was Conductedover two 10-hour shifts each day, the two-hour periods between shifts being used for servicing equipment. Work proceeded without major interruption for10 days when planting was discontinued due to the drying out of the seed bed.At that stage 22,000 acres had been seeded.Sufficient further rains fell on February 3 and 4, and planting was recommencedand carried to completion. The total area planted to grain sorghums amountedto 29,286 acres, the balance being sown with experimental crops and grasses.Two main varieties were sown, Kalo (18,941 acres) and Wheatland (10,345acres). A seeding rate of 5-6 lb. per acre was adopted, this low rate necessitatingthe use of special gears in seeding combines.During seeding operations experimental plots were sown for testing the suita-bility under Central West conditions of approximately 100 sorghum varietiesand crosses with seed supplied by the Department of Agriculture and Stock.Sowings were also made of several varieties of sunflower and soya beans,velvet and Mauritius bean, cow peas, etc.Experimental areas for erosion control have also been selected and laid outin consultation with Government experts. The contours of the land ploughedhowever are such that any serious general erosion is unlikely.Following seeding operations excellent rains have fallen to date the seasondeveloping from one of the driest to one of the wettest on record. Since seedingcommenced until March 31 the total rainfall at Peak Downs amounted to nearly19 in. This has resulted in excellent growth of the crop which at the close of the financial year shows every prospect of a yield of not less than 1 million bushels.Great credit is due to officers and men alike for the keenness and devotionto duty displayed in the conduct of operations which to date have been under-taken with no major hitch of any kind.Construction operations the buildings available at Peak Downs were those normally found on apastoral property. Although they have been useful they are by no meanssuitable for the Corporation^ purposes and side by side with agricultural opera-tions a building and construction programme has had to be put in hand.The two homesteads on the property have been made more habitable for occupation by staff and a housing programme has been commenced. particular attention has been paid to flyproofing and to improvements to lavatory, ablutionand lighting facilities. For the time being workmen have been accomodated in the shearers&apos; quarters supplemented by hutments and tents. A central sitehas been selected for an Operations Centre, and this, when completed, will contain machinery, seed, oil and grease stores, workshops, offices and quarters for single staff. A large prefabricated steel igloo was obtained and. at the endof the year erection was about half completed. The workshop has also been commenced.Three large grain stores at Capella capable of containing 20,000 tons ofbagged grain were designed and let by contract to a Rockhampton contractor.

At March 31 two sheds had been completed, and the third was well towardscompletion. A railway siding has been commenced to connect these sheds to themain line.The Main Roads Commission has partly completed by contract an all-weatheraccess road from Capella to Peak Downs, as the first section of a main roadextending easterly to Cotherstone.During the period between seeding and harvesting the Corporation^ staff was engaged on fencing, clearing and general farm improvement work.The construction of a cattle dip is well in hand and several new bores arebeing sunk by contract.*At the Moura piggery clearing of site has been undertaken and material is onthe ground ready for an early commencement of the piggery! The IrrigationCommission is undertaking the clearing and grading of the area to be irrigated.A contract is being let for the construction of a grain store at Bajool toserve the dual purpose of a holding store for grain for piggeries and for ashuttle rail service either to Port Alma or Gladstone for grain export as required.Plans are now being formulated for storage and other facilities required onproperties to be cropped during 1949-50.Plant, equipment and supplies generally the full complement of tractors, combines and harrows necessary to dealwith somewhat more than 30,000 acres was all on hand by. December 31, 1948.At the close of the financial year all headers ordered were in Brisbane ready for despatch to Peak Downs.Six jeeps were procured in England by the Overseas Food Corporation andhave proved invaluable during all phases of operations. They have been particularly useful for intra-farm operations during wet weather. Several utilitiesand heavy trucks and a number of flat-top trailers were procured for generalfarm work while a small power grader and a drawn grader were securedfor erosion control and road works. A seed grader was purchased for treatingseed grain, while two bag-stacking machines and other items of plant andequipment too numerous to specify individually have been sent to the property.The Corporation was fortunate in securing a number of buildings from an ex-R.A.A.F. station in the Charters Towers area. With the co-operation of theMain Roads Commission the buildings were all dismantled and transported toPeak Downs and elsewhere, where they have proved invaluable in the implement a-tion of the building programme.Timber, cement, roofing materials, piping, all of which are in short supply,have been obtained from various sources in reasonable quantities having regardto the heavy demand.A heavy future programme of building work is faced on other propertiesand it probably will be necessary to import building materials from overseas.Already a large order for aluminium roofing has been lodged on the Corporation^behalf by the Overseas Food Corporation.Ample supplies of camp equipment for use as temporary accommodationhave been placed in stock.A large quantity of new and second-hand bags has been placed in storeat Peak Downs and the thanks of the Corporation are due to the State WheatBoard for its help in arranging supplies.Orders for agricultural machinery for the 1949-50 season have been lodged,the aim being 100,000 acres under crop. Whether this target will be realiseddepend on the success achieved in obtaining plant. The Overseas Food Cor-poration is offering needed assistance in the supply of reconditioned tractors from england.

mEstablishment of piggeriesAs stated previously, the Corporation^ final objective is the production of pigs for export to Britain. Grain sorghum will be an essential constituent inthe pigs&apos; diet, which will be supplemented with green feed and other proteinrations.It was decided as a matter of policy that the pig-raising side of the Cor-poration&apos;s activities would proceed cautiously the main emphasis for the first year or so being placed on the production of grain sorghum a large task initself. However, it was decided that five experimental pig units should beestablished in selected localities in order thoroughly to test conditions and costs in various areas, methods of feeding, most suitable breeds and so on.As previously mentioned thie first piggery site has been selected on the DawsonRiver at Moura where there is an abundant water supply and suitable land both for the growth of pasture under irrigation and for the piggeries.At the close of the financial year the design of the piggery had been completed and preliminary work done in preparing the site.An organisation has been decided upon to enable the work to proceed as early as possible in the new financial year.The piggery will be on a 200-sow basis, and a supply of breeding sowshas been secured for transfer to the property as soon as work is sufficiently far advanced.A site suitable for several further piggeries has been secured, by agree-ment with the owners in the Bajool area south of Rockhampton. Here againthere is a good water supply and land both for irrigation and piggery sites.Final arrangements regarding the transfer of the land to the Corporation werebeing made at March 31.A further area has been selected along the Nogoa River in the vicinity ofEmerald and proceedings for acquisition * are about to commence. The StateGovernment proposes a new weir on the river convenient to this site thusassuring an ample supply of water for irrigation and other purposes.The possibilities for pig-raising of several other sites both on the&apos;coast andinland are being closely investigated.FinanceIn accordance with the provisions of the Queensland-British Food Produc-tion Act a system of accounts based on best commercial practice has beenadopted after consultation with the Overseas Food Corporation and their auditors,Messrs. Cooper Bros. &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, London, through (theirassociated office, Messrs. Cooper Brothers, Savage &amp; Co., Queensland.The results of transactions for the year appear in the Revenue and Expendi-ture Account, Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet (pp. 89-90).Owing to the financial year ending before the harvesting of the crop, theCorporation was faced with the problem of valuing standing crops. After full consideration it was decided to adopt a prudent policy and bring the growingcrops into the balance sheet at the actual expenditure incurred at the farms.This will enable the expenditure to be carried forward into next financial yearand correctly charged against the return from the crops to which it relates.Expenditure by Head Office amounting to  15,225 17s. Od. has also beencarried forward to the next year.It is pointed out that the whole of this expenditure has been incurred inconnection with the establishment and administration of the Head Office of theCorporation. Whilst it is usual for the preliminary expenses of an undertaking to be temporarily capitalised and written off over a period of years, the Cor-poration has decided to carry the amount forward and charge it against therevenue from the first crop.Having regard to the useful life of the various assets full provision hasbeen made in the Revenue and Expenditure Account for depreciation. provision has also been included for interest and accrued charges.

Works under construction  11,061 7s. lid represent actual expenditure todate on buildings in the course of erection and works under construction. Whencompleted final costs will be transferred to the relative asset accounts.The amount of  232,500 owing to the Co-coordinator-General of Public Worksrepresents the purchase price of Peak Downs, Cullin-la-Ringo and Inderi. Theseproperties were resumed for the Corporation, but execution of the instruments of Lease to the Corporation could not be finalised before the end of the year.Grazing activitiesAs the properties so far acquired and to be acquired for the Corporation^purposes have all a proportion of non^arable land it follows that the Corporationmust undertake grazing activities in order that the whole of its properties willbe fully utilised.In addition there will be considerable value in the stubbles remaining afterharvesting.As a matter of policy therefore, the Corporation has decided to undertakegrazing to an extent economically justifiable by feed available.Up to March 31, 1949, some 1,605 cattle had been purchased mostly on the open market. The prices were reasonable having regard to the demand which exists for store cattle following the widespread rains.It is confidently expected that the Corporation will produce a greater numberof stock from the properties acquired than were produced previously. This willbe in addition to its production-of grain sorghums.Appointment of auditors and solicitorsMessrs. Cooper Brothers, Savage &amp; Co., Brisbane, Chartered Accountants, were appointed Auditors to the Corporation for the year 1948-49.Messsrs. Thynne &amp; Macartney of Brisbane have been appointed as theCorporation^ Solicitors.Acknowledgment iIt is desired here to acknowledge the very great help given to the Corporationby the Hon. the Premier of Queensland (Hon. Mr. E. M. Hanlon, M.L.A.).His enthusiasm for the project and his personal interest in activities have beena stimulation to all concerned.State Government Departments, including the Department of the Co-coordinator-.General of Public Works, the Main Roads Commission, the Railways Depart-ment, the Lands Department, the Irrigation Commission, the Valuer-General&apos;department, the Bureau of Investigation of Land and Water Resources, the bureau of Industry, and the State Wheat Board have been most co-operative,and the results of this year as herein recorded could not have been achieved without their help.The Press have been fair and helpful in their comments on the progress ofthe scheme which has attracted.a good deal of public interest.Local Councils and Harbour Boards have also been most helpful.The work of the staff and workmen has already been acknowledged.On behalf of the Corporation &apos;(Sgd.)

153APPENDIX IIMAJOR contractors and THEIR work  the Contractors referred to in para. 5 undertook the work described below:  Pauling &amp; Co. Ltd. for land-clearing in the Kongwa Region, the con-struction of administrative buildings, storehouses, dwellings etc., togetherwith such ancillary services as may be required and the construction andmaintenance of all roads within the area, but excluding trunk roads for whichseparate contracts have to be made. Preliminary work on this contract began in April, 1947.Experience of work on this scale in Tanganyika was inadequate to enablefixed price contracts to be made, and the work was necessarily begun ona cost-plus basis. This stage was to terminate on June 30, 1949, and bereplaced by a fixed price contract on terms to be negotiated. Owing to therestriction of development in the Kongwa Region to three units, i.e., a totalof 90,000 acres, this contract should terminate by the end of 1949 and thecost-plus stage has been extended to the date of termination.John Mowlem &amp; Co. Ltd. have a contract in similar terms for land-clearing, building constructions etc., in the Southern Province of Tanganyikaexcept that the terminating date of the cost-plus stage of the contract isDecember 31, 1949. Preliminary work on this contract began in November,1947.Earthmoving &amp; Construction Ltd. (an East African Company) have aaimilar contract for the Urambo Region with the terminating date of thecost-plus stage at June 30, 1949. On March 30, 1949, the shares of this company were acquired by the Overseas Food Corporation. preliminary work under this contract began in October, 1947.The Consolidated Petroleum Co.

APPENDIX IVMEMORANDUMPresented by the Chairman of the overseas Food Corporation toThe Rt. Hon. John Strachey, M.P., Minister of food on theTRANSFER OF THE EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTSSCHEME TO THE OVERSEAS FOOD CORPORATION1. The Overseas Food Corporation, at the request of the Minister of Food,took over responsibility for the direction of the East African Groundnuts scheme from February 29, 1948. From that date the Managing Agency become answer-able to the Corporation instead of the Minister of Food. And on March 31,1948, the Corporation took over from the Managing Agents the day to daydirection of operations in East Africa.2. This decision to transfer responsibility to the Overseas Food Corporationas soon as practicable was in harmony with the early discussions between theMinistry of Food and the United Africa Company who agreed to undertake the duties of the Managing Agents for the time required by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to establish the Overseas Food Corporation. Under the original arrange-nients the Managing Agents with only a transitory responsibility were aloneable to exercise the functions of management while the Members Designate oftfie Corporation could merely advise. Although the Members Designate receivedfull and free co-operation from the Managing Agents, and their advice wasinvariably sought in matters concerning policy, this interim arrangement couldnot be continued indefinitely without weakening the temporary Managementsrower of decision and action.3 While administrative efficiency made the speedy transfer of responsibility to the Overseas Food Corporation desirable, the serious nature of the many diffi-culties being encountered in East Africa made it imperative that the responsibilityfor day to day decisions should be in the hands of the people who were tobe ultimately responsible for the Scheme. It had become apparent from an early,dale that operations could not go according to the plans envisaged by theWakcrield Mission&apos;s report. The principal contributory factors to this whichCi;&apos;would not have been foreseen at the time the Mission reported were, first, thecondition of the essential mechanical equipment the heavy tractors obtainedfrom surplus war stores on which the whole operation depended was muchw-nr^e than had been anticipated. Many machines required a thorough overhaulbefore they could be kept at work. Spares for these overhauls were not readilyavailahle. Second, the technical problems of clearing the Kongwa Jhorn busharid preparing the ground for sowing proved much more serious than had been anticipated. These difficulties were aggravated by the fact that Kongwa is atthe end of a long and difficult line of communication through the very congestedport of Dar-es-Salaam. It took months to shift stores of all kinds to Kongwafrom overseas.4. These various difficulties were apparent and dominated the situation when mr. Plummer and General Harrison, together with Mr. Faure, of the ManagingAgency, paid a visit to East Africa in the autumn of 1947. To avert the riskof an administrative breakdown it was then decided to reorientate the immediateprogramme by bringing the scope of operations more in line with the actual

supply position and thereby to counteract the effect on morale, which thefrustration, resulting from continued difficulties, was having on the staff. Thedifficulties of commencing an enterprise of this magnitude on a basis of improvisa-tion, without a prior adequate period of preparation, were having their effect and had resulted in:  (i) An incomplete overall plan of operation ;(ii) incomplete integration between the operations ;(iii) over-centralisation and the  absence of an  adequate  administrativemachine.5. All these circumstances rendered the transfer of day to day management to the Corporation at the earliest possible date very desirable. Not havingbeen submerged in the detailed day to day decisions, the Corporation was betterplaced to see the Scheme in perspective.6. In normal circumstances the transfer of responsibility would have been accompanied by detailed audited accounts at the date of transfer, but, in thecircumstances in which the Scheme was started it was apparent that there mustbe many gaps in the accounting records so as to make the preparation of suchcomplete accounts impracticable.For these reasons the Corporation had to agree to take over on the basis of a-skeleton check of major assets only.7. Some of the more serious problems which the Corporation has to meetare:-(i) the gravely inadequate repair and maintenance services for the tractors,agricultural machines and motor transport of all kinds ;(ii) the absence in East Africa of a proper system for the receipt, pricingand physical custody of all the various stores required ;(iii) the inadequate organisation for controlling expenditure in East Africa;(iv) the inadequacy of control of contractors&apos; work.8. The purpose of this memorandum is to set out the more serious problems with which the Corporation was faced at the time it assumed control of theScheme, without attempting to set out the underlying factors which had causedthem. It does not imply criticism of the management of the Scheme by the managing Agents during the period of their responsibility. Further measuresbeyond those already taken to rectify the present position are in hand but theMinister should understand that a considerable time must elapse before these measures can become fully effective.L. A. Plummer,Chairman.September 23, 1948.

PART I.   GENERAL SUMMARY AND conclusions. FORMATION, TERMS OF REFERENCE AND organisation the Department was initiated by the appointment of the Chief ScientificOfficer on January 30, 1947, with the following terms of reference: &quot;The principal responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer in the initialyears will be to carry out research and collect scientific data to form thebasis of the agricultural and soil preserving methods to be followed.&quot;The first object is the institution of agricultural methods capable ofgiving maximum yields consistent with the maintenance of soil fertility.Investigation of the production of other food crops will have to be pursuedconcurrently, both to feed the personnel and as a basis for the future developments outlined in the Mission&apos;s report, should these be undertaken.&quot; The Chief Scientific Officer will be assisted by a specialist staff and willbe responsible for directing the work of such scientific personnel as may benecessary.&quot;Following these instructions, the Chief Scientific Officer travelled to Tanganyikawith the advance party on January 30, 1947. Later in the year a secretary,a chemist, three soil surveyors, a soil chemist, an analyst, an agronomist, a statis-tician and an entomologist joined the staff of the Department, and at various times field assistants were seconded from the agricultural staff for work in theDepartment. African assistants were engaged for training and are becomingproficient in both field and laboratory work.An experimental farm of about 100 acres was developed at Kongwa, and experimental areas totalling 20 acres at Urambo (Western Province) and 7acres at Namanga (Southern Province) were also controlled by the Department.No laboratory facilities were available until March, 1948, when a temporarychemical laboratory in two tents was opened at Kongwa. The DepartmentalLibrary and offices were also housed in tents throughout the period.The work and staff of the Department is organised in six divisions as follows:  (a) Headquarters and Administration  (Chief  Scientific  Officer:   A.  H.Bunting, M.Sc, D.Phil.)(b) Soils(c) Experimental Crop Studies(d) Plant Protection(e) Laboratory(f) StatisticsMr. A. Walter (formerly Director, British East African Meteorological Service)was Meteorological Adviser to the Scheme during the year.The programme for the year included as principal items the following:- (a) Rapid reconnaissance surveys of areas in East Africa proposed for development by the Corporation (section&apos; 2),(fe) Soil fertility and fertiliser studies based in part on the surveys(sections 4, 11).(c) Experimental  crop  work  on  groundnuts  and  many   other  crops(sections 6, 7, 12, 13).(d) Preliminary surveys of insect and disease attacks on groundnuts and othercrops (sections 8, 14).(e) Routine laboratory investigation of soils and of the oil content of oilseeds(sections 4, 9, 11, 15).

2. SURVEYSThe first task of the Department was the survey and appraisal of the areassuggested for development.   These surveys had of necessity to be brief and directed to essentials&quot; only, and they have done no more than establish the mainvegetation and soil types of the areas and their probable extent. They have served, however, to site the main areas and to guide later investigations, particu-larly soil fertility studies and more detailed surveys.Five criteria have been adopted on which to judge proposed areas. Firstly,the area must be, in general climatic terms, one in which groundnuts and othertropical oilseeds will grow. In particular, rainfall must be adequate in amount and suitably distributed, giving over a number of years an average of not lessthan 20 in. falling in a five-month period, or longer in the case of largertotals. In many instances vegetation has had to be used as a guide in applying the data from distant stations to the rainfall conditions. of a particular area.Secondly, the soils must be medium loams or lighter in texture, since although many other crops than groundnuts are to be grown, the groundnut will be themost important oil producer and its needs must be given first consideration.Thirdly, drainage must be good. These last two considerations do not, of course,rule out the use of heavier and less well-drained soils, within any selected area,for other crops. Fourthly, soils must be such that no harmful chemical condi-tions exist, for example salinity, and any deficiencies in plant foods must be-capable of being met by the use of reasonable amounts of fertilisers and oflime. Fifthly, the general topography must be such that large scale mechanicaloperations will not involve excessive capital expenditure on soil conservation,measures.Naturally, no area could be selected where communications were inadequate-or incapable of improvement at reasonable cost, or where the vegetation was such that clearing operations would be prohibitively expensive. So important is the communications question that in future development of this kind it maywell prove best first to select a suitable port with good actual or potential interiorcommunications, and then explore its hinterland for suitable land.Eight areas have been surveyed from these points of view in the period. They-are:  Tanganyika:Kongwa (Mpwapwa district), Urambo (Tabora district),&apos;Southern Province Block A (Lindi and Masasi districts),Southern Province Block B (Liwale district),Korogwe/Handeni area (Korogwe and Handeni districts),Kenya:Malindi/Garsen area (Malindi district),Mackinnon Road (Voi district).northern rhodesia:Mumbwa area (Mumbwa and Broken Hill districts).Kongwa Region, Mpwapwa district, TanganyikaThis was the first area to be developed, and. during 1947-48 was the only one in which significant areas of land became available for agriculture. The originaltrading centre of Kongwa lies a few miles due north of Mpwapwa in the CentralProvince of Tanganyika, from which it is however separated by the Kiborianimountain block. The Kongwa Region of the Scheme lies well to the north ofKongwa itself, the nearest boundary of the cleared land being about 7 milesdistant, and running roughly east and west parallel with the Kiboriani mountain.The western boundary is roughly parallel with the northwesterly line of theChinene Hills, again at a few miles distance. The area as a whole forms thesouthernmost extension of the Masai steppe. Rainfall conditions are not accur-ately known, but at Kongwa mission, four miles from Kongwa towards the

Kiboriani Hills, the average from 1938-46 was 24 in. (see section 3, Climateand Meteorology). The wet season is from December to April, with an average&quot;dry gap&quot; of about 14 days in late January or February. The altitude of the region is in general between 3,500 and 4,500 feet above sea level. The topo-jjraphy is fairly mature, with the beds of former shallow lakes on the south side and scattered inselbergs and granitic outcrops throughout the area. The Kiborianiand Chinene hills, however, have been uplifted, at least in part, in the not toodistant past, and this has rejuvenated the topography in their neighbourhood.The main parent rocks range from granitic gneiss to hornblende-gneiss rich inbases. In general, the area is base-rich, and there are extensive lacustrine lime-stone deposits up to thirty feet thick containing small fossil shellfish.Three main groups of soils occur in the Kongwa Region. From the horn-blende-gneiss is derived a warm red sandy loam of distinctly high fertility whichcompacts on pressure and on drying. This soil shows no visual difference inprofile from the surface to parent rock, which may be as shallow as two feet, but is usually deeper. The more granitic rocks, occurring usually on the crests of thegentle ridges, yield a pallid yellow or buff to grey sandy soil (the upland pallidtype) often with iron-stained quartz in the layers immediately above the parentrock. In this soil type, or in a coarse variant of it with small ironstone con-cretions, water holes frequently occur. The third group contains the soils ofvalley bottoms and lake beds; these are brown to grey and black, and areheavy and often calcareous. Typical chemical-analyses are given in section 11.Borehole water in these areas is very hard and somewhat saline.The main vegetation of the Kongwa Region is a dense deciduous thicket,occurring on the red and upland pallid soils, containing several species ofCommiphora, with some Acacia spirocarpa, particularly on drainage lines, andscattered Adansonia digitata (Baobab). Many other species are also present.The thicket, which has been described by Hornby and Hornby (1942) has several-distinct communities within it. It is for the most part up to 15 feet high, andis impenetrable except along native paths and cattle or game tracks. Old lakebed areas form open grassy plains with locally scattered tall trees and limitedareas of various types of scrub. As in the rest of the areas, systematic botanicalwork in these interesting communities has not so far been possible.The presence of numerous overgrown water holes or hafirs, with earth walls-often built up to 20 feet high and of a similar thickness at base (occurring insome areas as frequently as one to every two square miles), and of very largeacacias and baobabs, taken together with the reaction of the thicket to clearingand to fire, leads to the belief that the country in the Kongwa Region wasformerly more densely&apos;populated by a well organised people, and that it was at that time far more open? Whether the thickening of the vegetation is dueto overgrazing by the cattle, leading to failure of fire to control regenerationof thicket species, or to the incursion of thicket into areas of former cultivation,is at present an open question.There is sufficient suitable land in the Kongwa Region for from 15 to 20 units(450,000 to .600,000 acres in all) and possibly more, but the scale of final develop-ment will depend on levels of yield and the state of communications, particularly the capacity of the Central Line railway and the port of Dar-es-Salaam to evacuate the produce.Urambo Region, Tabor a district, TanganyikaUrambo, on the Central Line railway, lies about 60 miles west of Tabora inthe Western Province of Tanganyika. The altitude is about 3.500 feet, andrainfall in the area (for which there are no previous records) is believed to lie between 30 in. and 35 in. annually, falling from December to May.The topography is extremely mature and peneplanated. The drainage linesare almost completely filled in and take the form today of wide open grassyor lightly wooded areas, swampy in the wet season, but with little or no flow,of water.

mincised water courses are not found, and outcrops arc few and far between.The main rock of the area is a coarse granitic rock of the Basement complex.The soils of the area belong to Milne&apos;s group of plateau soils (Milne, 1936,1947). Three main types are of practical importance.On the crests of higher ridges a red medium loam is found lying on thegranite. A massive ironstone layer is often observed in the profile in immediatecontact with the granite, and filling the inequalities in its surface. Apart fromorganic matter accumulation in the surface layers the profile is otherwise uniform.The greater part of the Region, however, is covered by a pallid grey leachedsandy topsoil, darkened by organic matter in the surface layers, overlying atsix to twelve inches a.horizon of considerable depth, which may range frombright red to pale yellow in colour, depending largely on the position of theexposure on the long, gentle slopes. In the infilled drainage channels is founda complex range of dark coloured alluvial soils varying in texture at the surfacefrom sands to-stiff clays. The lower layers are almost always heavy.Nodular calcium carbonate does not.appear in the soils of these areas exceptin the bases of the great termite mounds, where the accumulations may reach a thickness of several feet. This is particularly the case in the drainage areasouth of Ussinge. A few analytical figures for these soil types are available(section 11). Borehole water is in general soft.The Urambo Region shows two important broad types of vegetation. Themain type, covering with its many variants almost all of the Region, is theBrachygstegla-lsoberlinia open woodland (&quot;miombo&quot;), which is here seen not far from the nprthermost limit of its extent. Pterocarpus angolensis (&quot; mlinga &quot;or &quot; muninga &quot;), which in Rhodesia and South Africa is not a common miomboconstituent, is the most important economic timber. The woodland is fromIS to 40 feet high, and has a grass covered floor. The trees are typically spacedfrom 10 to 3b feet apart, and in the dry season a light vehicle can travelanywhere in the woods. The leaf canopy, although nearly continuous, is notdense, so that the woodland is not dark. Fierce fires sweep annually throughthe woods in the dry season. This community is the home of several speciesof tsetse fly, and in many sections of the Urambo area the infestation is very heavy.The second main vegetation type of the area is the seasonally swampygrassland of the drainage lines. At the margins of the grassland there is oftena zone in which trees are restricted to the termite mounds, giving a parklikeappearance.Land of this general type extends over many thousands of square miles in&quot;western Tanganyika, but communication difficulties will probably limit theUrambo development to a small number of units for some time to come.*Southern Province areas, Tanganyika (General)The vast areas proposed for development in the Southern Province are as yet imperfectly known and little reliable topographic work has been done. Thewhole area lies in a rainfall zone of 30 to 40 inches, falling in a single seasonfrom late November to May, and at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 feetabove sea level.. Topographically much of the area is in an advanced stage of peneplanation,particularly in the lands north of the Mbemkuru river and to the east of theLiwale-Tunduru scarp. The soils are varied, and for the most part not sofar advanced towards senescence as those of the Urambo Region. Many areindeed still in a stage of late maturity. The main plant formations can beincluded under the headings of Brachystegia-Isoberlinia open woodland(&quot; miombo &quot;) of several types, Combretum other species light open savannah, andswamp or drainage line grasslands. Pterocarpus angolensis occurs in both miomboand savannah.

Southern Province, Block A area, Lindi and Masasi districts, TanganyikaThis block is roughly contained by the Ruponda-Lukuledi road, the Lukulediriver, the Londo hills, the Mbemkuru river and the Ruponda-Liwale road. Itis gently undulating rather than fiat. There are few broad open drainage zones,the majority of the streams being incised. Granitic rock of the basement complexoutcrops on some of the ridges. A coarse crystalline limestone occurs atNamanga. near Ruponda, and at other places. The main soils range from redand red brown light and medium loams, found on the higher ground and near the bases of hills to rich brown loams and to grey sandy loams, with heavy cracking clays in the depressions. Analyses of a few Block A soils aregiven in section 11. Vegetation is almost entirely miombo, with bamboo inthe wetter sites, particularly on old farms, but the type varies from heavyin the western areas approaching the Liwale-Tunduru scarp, to light in the centre of the block.Southern Province, Block B area, Liwale district, TanganyikaThis area lies north of the Ruponda-Liwale road, and includes the Mtondovalley and the watershed areas between the Mtondo and the Mbemkuru. this area is again rather undulating than flat, but contains several large open drainagelines with heavy soils and grassy vegetation. Much of the area is light opensavannah thickening on the ridges to light miombo. Granite outcrops have been seen, but the area is unsurveyed geologically.The soils of the higher areas are warm red-brown to brown light loams.(The white sands of the Liwale district, with their heavy miombo and secondarythicket vegetation, are excluded by the western boundary.) There are sectionswhose pedology is not yet clear, of black humic sandy sous covered by a layerof coarse sand wash, in the Mtondo valley. In general, Block B is a much easier area to clear than Block A.Handeni area, Korogwe and Handem districts, TanganyikaThis area in north-east. Tanganyika was rejected. It lies at about 1,500 to2,000 feet above sea level, in the upper valley of the Pangani river. Rainfallis about 30 in. annually. It was found to be inadequate in area, being badlybroken towards the east, and the principal soil, a heavy red loam, is unsuitable for the mechanical cultivation of groundnuts.Malindi area, Malindi district, KenyaThe area, which has been rejected for the time being, lies between 20 and60 miles north of Malindi on the Garsen road, and stretches inland from the6ea for 10 to 30 miles. The soils (red to yellow sandy loams with calciumcarbonate in the subsoil at places) are suitable, and the vegetation, an openscrub with much Acacia and Commiphora, is fairly light. The rainfall was,however, regarded as inadequate. Although the average at Malindi is 41 in.,the total evidently falls off to the north and west. This total is divided between two seasons in each year, and the risk of a shortfall in any one season was con-sidcred serious. Further, communications are very poor. Trial plots have, how-fever, given fairly good yields, and the area is still under observation by theDepartment.Mackinnon Road area, Voi district, KenyaThe area proposed here lies about 60 miles from Mombasa on the kenya and Uganda railway. It is at about 1,500 feet, and the average rainfall for Mackin-non Road station is 28 in. This precipitation is, however, spread over eight monthsof the year, again with two maxima, and the danger of drought led to the rejection of the area. The soils are mostly bright red light loams, with ironstoneconcretions in the subsoil. Vegetation is a light Commiphora scrub. Ground wateris stated to be saline.  The area is now under development as a military base.

ISMumbwa area, Mumbwa district, Northern RhodesiaThis area is bounded, about 35 miles west of Lusaka, by the Mwembeshi river,and continues in a long, narrow strip, somewhat broken by the drainage, for about 70 miles between the vast seasonally flooded flats of the Kafue river to thesouth and the boundary of the heavy miombo on grey-white plateau soils 15 to20 miles to the north. Rainfall is from 25 to 35 in. in a single season from december to April. Apart from the limestone hills and granite ridges of thenorthern edge, and scattered outliers of the same formations in the area, thetopography is extremely level. The soils are distinctly sub-tropical in type, varying from silty, light grey to heavy red loams on the higher ground to heavy grey and black clay loams in the valleys. The area of red soil is relatively small, greyand brown loams being more typical. The vegetation is very varied, but mostlylight, consisting of a number of types of light open woodland and parkland orsavannah with Combretum, Peltophorum, Afromosia and other species, and withtall grass. On the more broken ground and in a few areas on level ground out-liers of miombo stretch from the northern boundary.Although the soils are somewhat heavier than those of the Tanganyika areas,excellent yields were obtained on trial plots conducted by the Northern RhodesianDepartment of Agriculture. The heavier types seem likely to be well suited tosunflowers and maize. The area is hot likely to be developed until the futureof the transport situation in the Rhodesias can be more confidently foreseen.3. CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGYAlthough little formal meteorological work has been possible, mainly due to lack of equipment, some general observations.may be of value in amplifying the description of the areas in Section 2.All of the areas in which the scheme is operating are semi-arid, in that theirclimates are all marked by a practically rainless season of at least six months.The rainy seasons are in general more or less continuous from December to theend of April, but there is a tendency to the development of a double rainfallmaximum in the Central and Western Provinces, and there is a distinct periodof scattered rain in October, in the Southern and Western Provinces.KongwaThe 1947-48 season was a relatively dry one throughout the Central Province.Failures of maize and bulrush millet, due to the drought, were common. Themidseason gap was a very long one, lasting at Kongwa from about January 20to the beginning of March, and this was a factor of great importance in con-sidering the results of the agricultural operations, since it covered the early growthperiod of many of the plantings. Rainfall was recorded during the season at kongwa headquarters, and at Units 1 and 2. The results were as follows, ininches: -	Nov.	Dec.	Jan.	Feb.	Mar.	Apr.	May	June	July	Season totalKongwa H.Q.   ... Kongwa, Unit 1...

Individual storms are frequently confined toan area only a mile wide, although their path may run for several miles. Rainreaches the units at Kongwa very largely from the north and north-east. Somecomes in from the west, due to orographic precipitation started on the Chinenehills. Kongwa itself receives a certain amount of rain from clouds which movealong Kiboriani mountain from the east or cross it from the south-east, but suchrain has not been observed to reach the plains to the north. It appears, therefore,that the rain shadow of the Kiboriani block in respect of rain coming from thesouth-east is practically complete.

Some of these points were further illustrated by a series of four gauges placed -in February, 1948, at 2-mile intervals on an east-west line on Unit 1. The threeeasterly gauges, on higher ground, showed similar readings and received rain onthe same days and in comparable quantities. The westernmost gauge, oh theslope leading to the Kinyasungwe depression, and facing the Chinene hills, was apparently being affected by an entirely different rainfall system, although thetotal was not very different from that received by the other gauges.In the coming season, rain gauges will be set up throughout the cleared area at the same density of one for 4 square miles in order to continue these studiesand to provide the Unit staffs with more precise indications day by day of rainfalldistribution.Many visitors to Kongwa have commented on the supposedly marginal natureof the Kongwa climate, particularly in respect of low total amount, seasonalvariability and bad distribution of the rainfall. Evidence has been adduced fromRecords at uodoma both of rainfull and of famine and scarcity years in theProvince.It is true that of the three Tanganyika areas, Kongwa.has the lowest and leastcertain rainfall. In assessing this matter, however, the following facts must betaken into account:  The rainfall situation in the production areas at Kongwa, as distinct from thatat Dodoma, SO miles to the west, is evidently influenced by the Chinene hills onthe western boundary of the area. These hills are effective in intercepting rainfallcarried on the prevailing rain-bearing easterly winds.In the 1947-48 crop season, although African crops, particularly of maize,were largely a failure in the Kongwa area for lack of rain, maize and othergrain crops of suitable varieties were successful in plantings made by the ScientificDepartment. This is in part due to better agricultural methods, but must also be influenced by the factors considered below.Although at Kongwa total rainfall is low, it is compressed into a season of4  to 5 months. The average rainfall per week is thus higher than might beassumed. The variability of rainfall may be expected to be offset to some extent by effective water conservation measures. Investigations on the Kongwa Experi-ment Station have shown that under standing bush the soil is dry in August toa depth of at least 6 feet. On the other hand, on cleared and contoured fields,down a long slope, most of which were not planted in 1947-48, and carried adense growth of weeds through the season (until ploughed in late April), moisturewas present at 4 feet depth in the upper fields, rising lower down to as littleaw 18 in. The average quantity present down the slope was shown by samplingto be equivalent approximately to 4 in. of rainfall. Therefore, by eliminatingrunoff, moisture can be stored in the soil at Kongwa, in spite of weed growth,which must have used far more water during the season than a well-kept crop of groundnuts would have done. If this general result is confirmed by more precise investigations, which are to be undertaken, it may well transform theestimation of the climatic possibilities at Kongwa, in regard to both cropproduction and water supplies.Concern has been expressed, too, at the high winds of Kongwa itself duringthe 1948 dry season. These v/ere far more severe than the winds in the produc-tion areas 7 miles and over to the north of Kongwa. It seems likely, therefore,that whether or not the gales are a regular annual phenomenon (which accordingto experience and observation is open to serious doubt), they are much intensifiedby the turbulence induced by Kiboriani mountain.UramboThe Urambo Region has a rainfall of 30 in. to 35 in. per year. It seems to&apos;have shared the relatively dry season experienced by Kongwa in 1947-48. Humi-commodities appear to remain high during rainless periods, but it is not known whether

Ais will continue to be the case when extensive clearings have been made. Therainfall, in inches, at Urambo from January to July, 1948, was as follows:  January	February	March	April	May	June	July	Total January to July7-51	3-65	8-59	6-46	Nil	Nil	Nil	26-11The dry gap in February and the sudden cessation of the rains are well shown.Southern province the climate of the Southern Province is in many ways similar to that of theWestern Province. It has, however, a less marked,dry gap in the early part ofthe season, the October rains are more pronounced and the rainfall appears tobe more reliable from year to year. Humidities are generally higher, and thereare more cloudy days. These features are undoubtedly connected with loweraltitude (1,500-2,000 feet only, as against 3,500 feet in the Western Province) andproximity to the sea. Rainfall records were kept in 1948 at Namanga, nearRuponda, from February onwards, with the following results (in inches): February	March	April	May	June	July	Total February to July7-35	5-43	1-61	006	0-07	Nil	14-52For practical purposes the rains ceased at the end of March, the subsequentrains being scattered. This is not usual, for in many seasons the rains continueinto May. In most respects the Southern Province area has the most suitableclimate for agricultural purposes of all the Tanganyika areas.4. SOIL FERTILITY STUDIES AND FERTILISER POLICYFertiliser policyFertiliser policy for the 1947-48 season, in which groundnuts were to be themain crop, had to be laid down at the end of 1946 with no detailed informationwhatever on the soil conditions of the areas. On general tropical experience,and after a review of American investigations on groundnuts, it was concluded that deficiencies of P2Os, available N and Ca were to be expected, and thatplacement drilling at the same level as the seed and two inches to either side of it would give more efficient utilisation of fertiliser than broadcasting.Combine drilling of fertiliser (in contact with the seed) was ruled out by american results. The fertiliser specification recommended provided for phos-phate at the rate of 0.4 to 0.5 cwt. P2Os per acre, with 0.1 cwt. per acre of N,both in water soluble form in a granular and concentrated fertiliser. The smallN dressing was intended to meet the needs of rapid growth in the crop in theearly weeks before N supply from the root nodules become effective. Lime wasto be applied at a. low rate (8 cwt. per acre) where soil acidity and available Cadeterminations indicated the need. Two materials only were commercially avail-able which met the fertiliser specification.   They were:  	Percentage N	Percentage P2O5	Rate per acreAmmonium phosphate    ......     ... Mixture of sulphate of ammonia and triple superphosphate............	11 6	48 30	1 cwt. 1$ cwt.Supplies of these materials were secured for the 1947-48 season.

Soil analysisOne of the first tasks of the Department was to secure analytical data for thesoils to be developed, particularly in respect of acidity (pH), and availableP3O5, N, Ca arid K. A considerable volume of analytical work was accordinglycarried out, using indicators for pH and a rapid extraction method for &quot; avail-able &quot; plant foods. The method used, which is due to. Truog, suffers from thecommon defect of all such methods, that its results are only of use in so fairas the method is calibrated by field experiments. It had, however, proved of use.in the rapid detection of phosphate deficiency in British soils, and on this basis itwas adopted. The important thing was to make a start with a technique that could be used at once to give general impressions, rather than to delay the workuntil more complicated methods (of equally unknown validity) could be adopted..More recently, of course, standard laboratory methods, including the glasselectrode for pH measurement, have been introduced, and the majority of thesoils have been analysed again, at least for Ca.A detailed summary of the results of these analyses is presented in section 11.It shows that all the Kongwa soils are low in available P and high in available K.The characteristic pH values for the red soils and the upland pallid soils at kongwa are in the neighbourhood of 6.0 and 6.5 respectively. The mean availableCa content for each group is about 85 most. available Ca per 100 gm. of soil.The valley soils are highly calcareous, having a mean available Ca content of220 most. per 100 gm. of soil, and consequently these soils have generally higherpH values (6.6 to 8.0) than those of the other two groups. Available Mg contentis roughly equal to available Ca content in red and upland pallid soils, but is only about one half of available Ca content in the valley soils. The Kongwa soilsthus exhibit the usual characteristics of the soils of semi-arid regions.Very few soil samples from the Urambo Region and the Southern Provincehave so far been analysed, but the soils in these areas may prove to be deficientin P but to have adequate K. At Urambo most of the grey soils have very lowavailable Ca contents, although they are only slightly acid.Soil fertility experiments1 Four types of experiments were designed to elucidate the main require-ments of the groundnut crop, on&apos;which fertility studies &quot;in the year underreview were concentrated. Each of these types was repeated eight times inthe production area at Kongwa, once on grey and once on red soils at Uramboand once on a somewhat atypical heavy red loam at Namanga in the southern province (Block A), making 44 experiments in all. These types were asfollows:  General exploratory experimentsThese were designed to test the effects of N, P205, K20 and Ca, and theplacement drilling of N and P2Os. The rates of application of plant foodswere:  .0-1 cwt. N per acre as i cwt. of sulphate of ammonia.0-5 cwt. P2O5 per acre as 2  cwt. of superphosphate.0-6 cwt. K2O per acre as 1 cwt. muriate of potash.8 cwt. per acre of ground limestone from Sagara, Kongwa district.The detailed results of these experiments, at all centres, appear in section 11.The most important features of the results at Kongwa are shown in the followingtable, .in which the figures for the eight experiments are averaged: -Table 1: Averaged results of 8 exploratory experiments, groundnuts, Kongwa,1947-48.

N has been of little value, even when placed; but P2Os has given nearly80 lbs. additional nuts when broadcast alone, and when placed it has given a further 68 lbs., making 148 lbs. in all. The effect of P2Os was also shown to be reduced by the presence of N, particularly when the fertilisers were placed,so that not only did N have little effect alone, but it reduced the effect ofP205. There was thus considerable justification on the first year&apos;s results foreliminating N from the fertiliser prescription for groundnuts at Kongwa.At Urambo, on the grey soil type, the exploratory experiment was to someextent vitiated, since the fertiliser was placed by hand too close to the seedand planting conditions were adverse. Nevertheless, on the red soil type a usefuleffect of placed P2Os was obtained, while K20 appeared to be effective on thegrey soil.At Namanga, on the heavy red soil type, planting was very late, and theteed germinated very poorly (possibly owing to a long delay in humid conditions at Dar-es-Salaam in transit, the seed having been decorticated at Kongwa), sothat stands were very poor. The local staff sought to remedy this defectby planting up the gaps with fiwi bean. This crop was harvested separately,and weighed green at harvest, and the results give some indication of soilconditions. In the exploratory experiment a strong effect of P2Os was shown.Results for the groundnut crop in the experiments at Namanga are not availableowing to errors after harvest.Experiments on types of phosphateAs stated above, it was assumed at the outset (and later proved) that phosphatewould be of value for increasing groundnut yields. It was, therefore, of importanceto discover what type of P2Os would yield the best economic return. Thiswould not only be affected by the availability of the phosphate in the fertiliserto the groundnut crop on the soils to be developed, but also by the cost, includingthe cost of transport. The second type of experiment, of which six exampleswere brought to harvest at Kongwa, was aimed at this problem. It compareda wide range of processed and rock phosphates with superphosphate, the materialsall being broadcast by hand on the plots.The materials tested were superphosphate at approximately 1, 2 and 4 cwt.per acre (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 cwt. P2Os per acre) and triple superphosphate,ammonium phosphate, a mixture of sulphate of ammonia and triple super-phosphate, a nitrophosphate (prepared by treating phosphate rock with nitricacid instead of sulphuric acid, as in the case of superphosphate), Uganda rockphosphate from Tororo, a soda phosphate prepared from the Uganda rockphosphate&apos; (by heat treatment with so.da ash), Algerian rock phosphate fromGafsa (a standard material in the manufacture of phosphatic fertilisers aswell as in research), Christmas Island rock phosphate, Saphos (Egyptian)Took phosphate, and a mixture of equal weights of Gafsa rock P2Os withsuperphosphate. In this last material the availability of the originally watersoluble P20, in the superphosphate is reduced by a reaction (called reversion)with the rock phosphate. All these materials were applied at rates calculated togive 0.5 cwt. P-Oj per acre ; and differences in N content were balanced up with sulphate of ammonia.These materials cover a wide range in the availability of the phosphate theycontain. The superphosphate, triple superphosphate, ammonium phosphate, andsulphate of ammonia/triple superphosphate mixture have over 90 per cent,of their P2Os in water soluble forms, and practically all of it is soluble in1 per cent, citric acid, a standard reagent in the testing of phosphatic materials.The Gafsa/superphosphate mixture has about two-fifths of its phosphate watersoluble, and nearly two-thirds citric soluble. The P2Os in the nitro-phosphateis one-tenth water soluble and three-fifths citric soluble. None of the othershas any appreciable content of water soluble P2Os, and their citric solubleP205 ranges from over 70 per cent, in the soda P2Os to 17 per cent, in theoriginal Uganda rock phosphate.   These points are tabulated in section 11.

Materials of high citric but low water soluble P2Oj content may be of special importance. Soils are known, and are believed to be common in the wettertropics, which react with water soluble P2Os in ways that greatly reduce itsavailability to crops. Citric soluble (but water insoluble) phosphate, which isgenerally available to crops, reacts more slowly with the soil, and may thus be of higher efficiency on such reactive soils.The results at Kongwa indicate broadly that the effectiveness of the materialsdecreases with decreasing water or citric solubility. The average increase ofyields from highly water soluble phosphates was from 60 to - 80 lb. per acre,much as in the broadcast phosphate treatment of the exploratory experiment at kongwa (above). The lowest average increase (2 lb.) was from Uganda rock.Nitrophosphate was an exception to this general result, giving a far smallerincrease in yield than would have been expected from the citric solubility.The design employed in these experiments was inefficient statistically, andthe results varied widely from one site to another. Further, the materials werebroadcast, which has now been shown to be less effective than placement drilling,at least for water soluble fertiliser. The results cannot be regarded as givingmore than a general indication of the relative usefulness of the materials.At Urambo the results of the corresponding experiment on the grey soilwere inconclusive. On the red soil there was a general increase in yield withsuperphosphate of about 60 lb., but other materials appear to have been less effective. At Namanga the fiwi bean weights from the phosphate experimentShow considerable general improvements with phosphate which were againbroadly related to the citric solubility values of the materials.In the 1948-49 season an improved design has been adopted for experimentson these questions, and all materials are being placement drilled.Experiments on rate of application of standard fertiliserThe standard fertiliser used for groundnuts at Kongwa was a mixture ofsulphate of ammonia and triple superphosphate containing 6 per cent. Nand 30 per cent. P2Os. Experiments were set out to supplement those already described by testing the effect of varying the rate of application of this standardmaterial. The fertiliser was applied with the placement drill at the standard rate of If cwt. per acre (0.5 cwt. Pa05 per acre) and at one quarter and one halfof this rate.The average results of seven experiments at Kongwa were as follows:-Table 2. Average results of seven experiments on rate of applicationof standard fertiliser, groundnuts, Kongwa, 1947-48No fertiliserQuarter rateHalf rate ...Full rate   ...Yield kernels,lbs. per acre678654724817Yield difference kernels,lbs. per acre-24+ A6+ 139The reduction in yield at the lowest rate was even more marked in someof the individual experiments, and there is some indication that adverse andbeneficial effects were working in opposition. This may well be related tothe reduction by nitrogen of the effect of phosphate (and vice versa), whichwas shown in the Kongwa exploratory experiments (page 106); and it illustrates the inadvisability of testing fertiliser mixtures when the actions and interactionsof the components are not fully understood.At Urambo, on both red and grey soils, the fertiliser in the correspondingexperiments gave improvements in yield which rose with the rate of application,but again there was some indication of adverse interactions. The fiwi beanfigures from the plots of the experiment at Namanga varied in the same way,showing marked improvements in yield.

ftExperiments on the calcium nutrition of groundnutsAmerican experiments (for example Col well and Brady, 1945) have shownthat on certain soils very deficient in lime (Ca) considerable increases in yieldmay be obtained by dusting the plants with gypsum (calcium sulphate) atthe early flowering stage. These increases may be far greater than thoseobtained by broadcasting ground limestone before planting or by combine drillinglimestone with the seed. It is known that developing groundnut pods, in theirearly stages, have structures like root hairs (Pettit, 1895, Reed, 1924), and thatthey absorb plant foods and water independently of the main root system ; andit has been shown that in some varieties of groundnut, at least, Ca is of thehighest importance for kernel formation (Burkhart and Collins, 1941). It maybe that under the relatively humid conditions of the south-eastern United Statesgypsum has special advantages for the groundnut crop, being rapidly absorbed by the nuts when applied to the surface of the soil just as their development is beginning.This question was examined by means of a series of experiments in whichlimestone was applied at 1, 4 and 8 cwt. per acre, while on other plots gypsumwas applied at rates giving equivalent Ca. Each of these treatments was applied in three ways: broadcast before sowing, drilled with the seed, and spreadover the plants at first flowering six to eight weeks after sowing. All plotsreceived a uniform dressing of phosphate.At Kongwa, where acutely Ca deficient or acid soils are rare, and at Uramboon the red soil, no benefit was obtained from either lime or gypsum, and sometreatments reduced yields. On the grey soil at Urambo the crop was some-what improved by low rates of gypsum, but the most marked increases, from781 to over 900 lb., were from 4 cwt. of limestone, which also seemed to have its best effects when broadcast before sowing.At Namanga fiwi bean showed large responses to limestone and smaller onesto gypsum applications.It seems, therefore, that there is no case for general applications of limestoneat Kongwa, but that limestone may be required for parts at least of the Uramboand Southern Province areas, where the matter is under further examination.Recommendations on fertiliser policy at KongwaWith present costs of P and N the results of the majority of the fertiliserexperiments on groundnuts at Kongwa lead to the conclusion that P:05 appearsto be the only plant food whose large-scale application to the groundnut cropat Kongwa is likely to be economic, and that N often reduces the effective-ness of P2O5. The average benefit from the placement drilling there of 0.5 cwt..PsOs as water soluble granular fertiliser was 148 lbs. kernels per acre. (It isnot yet known whether this can be still further increased by raising plantpopulation.) At an assumed future price of  41 0s. Od. per ton of groundnuts,f.o.b. Dar-es-Salaam, as a basis, and deducting  6 0s. Od. per ton for decortication,bags, railing and handling charges, this quantity is worth just over 46 shillings.The cost of the fertiliser required to produce this result is shown in the followingtable:-Table 3.

The S.A. type of superphosphate can probably be produced in Tanganyika,which should further increase its profitability; but this is to some extent offset by rather higher storage and transport costs per acre owing to the greaterbulk needed.It is too early to attempt the corresponding calculation for groundnuts inother areas.The fertiliser requirements of other crops likely to be grown (such as sunflower)are probably very different from those of groundnuts, particularly in regardto nitrogen. Pending the result of investigations, it may be expected that thesecrops will require a fertiliser containing a higher proportion of nitrogen than is contained in the fertiliser at present in use ; probably a 1; 1 ratio of N : Pas highly concentrated as 25:25 (which could be secured approximately bymixing ammonium phosphate with ammonium nitrate) would be suitable.(Ammonium nitrate in the prilled form is an entirely practicable fertilisermaterial under Kongwa conditions.) With the industrial development of new types of phosphate, even mote concentrated materials may be possible, but their higher cost may not offset the saving in transport and storage charges.Investigations are proceeding into the placement drilling of cheaper phos-phatic materials, which may further increase the profitability of the use of fertilisers.Liming at Kongwa should be confined to the limited areas where acidity orCa deficiency are demonstrated by analysis.5. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONAlthough in the present division of responsibilities conservation is not partof the duty of the Scientific Department, some experience has accumulated overthe period under review as a result of operations on the Kongwa ExperimentStation and elsewhere.The conservation system at present in use at Kongwa is based bn the necessityof removing flattened bush and roots from the cultivated area, of preventingerosion, and of conserving as much water as possible by inducing it to percolateinto the ground. Accordingly, level contours were laid out at 9-foot vertical inter-vals and the Clearing debris together with some earth was pushed on to the contourfines, forming the so-called windrows. Wherever it has been correctly appliedit can be claimed that this system has prevented major erosion damage duringthe crop season 1947-48. There has, however, been some tendency for wash,to occur within the contour strips, particularly where slight inequalities of theground concentrate the rain water, or where occasional extremely heavy stormsat the rate of li. to 2 inches per hour over periods of up to 45 minutes, areexperienced. Although recording gauge data are not available, it seems thatthe general storm intensity Is of the order of one inch per hour, and that fallsat a rate over two inches per hour are distinctly uncommon. These heavierstorms appear to be in all instances of considerably less than one hour&apos;sduration. It should be noted that the foregoing data apply to Kongwa only:in the Western and Southern Provinces, where total annual falls are higher,storms have been experienced of considerably longer duration.It would seem advisable to plan in future for the gradual replacement ofthe windrows by properly constructed broad-based terraces, while intermediateterraces should be put in, giving a general vertical contour interval of 4  feetor less. These might well be developed by ploughing, and should be of suchconstruction, that farm operations can proceed over them. The present windrowshave the further disadvantage that they are a breeding-ground for weeds, par-ticulafly species of Ipomoea and Cynodon plectostachyum which Spread bystolons or runners. They may also become the source of insect infestations,particularly of the blue plant-sucking bug, Catidea dregei, referred to in sections and 14?Other measures necessary are the location and grassing-up of minor gullies.In areas of particularly steep slopes (over 3 per cent.) it may well be an advan-tage to develop variable grade terraces, discharging into the larger gullies, in

-which a system of small dams would be used to retain the water. These damswould provide a valuable addition to the water resources of the Units, whichin the absence of surface (and roof) collection of various types are likely to bemeagre in the Kongwa Region,The soil and water conservation system thus developed will certainly form part of a general land and water utilisation policy aimed at the optimum develop-ment of the whole region under the Corporation^ control. In particular, thispolicy will be necessary for the provision of water and grazing for the cattleherds required to feed the staff of the Units, and for irrigation water, in particu-larly suitable areas, for vegetable production.Evidently^ however, many of these developments must await the completionof clearing before any significant quantity of heavy machinery is available fortheir execution; and they must turn, too, on the full practical demonstrationthat the technical success of the agricultural aspects of the scheme is certain.A word needs to be said about wind erosion. Those who have had bitterexperience of the dust raised from camps and roads in the turbulence zone ofKiboriani mountain, in which Kongwa itself lies, have talked of the developmentof dust-bowls. In fact, no wind erosion has been observed onv the productionUnits except where ill-made and unsurfaced tracks have been pounded intodust by fast and heavy traffic. The natural tendency of the majority ofthe Kongwa soils to compact on drying is a valuable safeguard against move-ment of the soil by wind in the dry season.In the Western and probably in the Southern Province, the ,erosion situationis different from that at Kongwa. Firstly, the total precipitation is higher,and storms seem to be of rather longer duration. The extremely eventopography particularly at Urambo opposes quick run-off of surplus rain-water, and where natural depressions or tree-stump cavities occurred, poolswere frequently left for long periods, particularly in the grey&apos; soil. It seems certain that variable grade terraces, discharging into grassed-up water-courses, will have to be the standard pattern of conservation policy, but therewill be the difficulty that the topography does not provide many obvious gullies.Ploughing will have to be carried out to leave marked open furrows, to aiddrainage, and ridge cultivation will be of great value.The broad, open, infilled drainage channels which occur in the Urambo region and in Block B, Southern Province, will present considerable possibilities for riceand even fish-farming, provided they are developed in such a way as to takeadvantage of surplus water discharged from the terrace outfalls6. GROUNDNUT PRODUCTIONPlant populationAmerican experience (Stansel, 1935 ; Lovvorn and Kime, 1939; Parham, 1942 ;Department of Botany, Georgia Experimental Station, 1945) indicates that oneof the most important factors in securing maximum groundnut yields is theestablishment of a high plant population. It was evident before planting began,that the bad seed-bed conditions on the units and the general inexperienceof the staff engaged on the planting work would make the establishmentof satisfactory stands of plants difficult at Kongwa, particularly whenthe spasmodic character of the rainfall and the high temperature and evapora-tion rates of the sowing season were taken into account. Accordingly, a survey was undertaken by the Department, with the assistance of Unit staff, todetermine the actual plant population on the production fields. This survey was carried out during January, 1948.Planting was in 28 in. rows, using at first a spacing in the row of 5i in.(theoretical population about 41,000). After a few days it became apparent that the factors mentioned above, together with the poor quality of the seedHI

produced by the decorticators, the tendency of the planter to clog when work-mg in wet ground and to harm the seed when operated at too high a speed,and the incidence of Aspergillus rot in certain areas, were in fact resulting inthe establishment of a population far below expectation. The survey showedan actual average establishment of 13,000 plants per acre only. The spacingwas accordingly reduced to 3 in. (theoretical population 64,000 per acre), anda population of 24,000 was produced.Overall, a mean establishment of 18,000 plants per acre, corresponding toabout one-third of the seed used, was found. The establishment turned in parton variety, Spanish Bunch (from Texas) giving an establishment percentage of 27,while Natal Common and Valencia (known in South Africa as Virginia Bunch),gave respectively 36 per cent, and 39 per cent.At harvest time yields were recorded field by field, and it was then possibleto correlate the yields with the plant population. In addition, similar datawere provided by the results of fertility trials carried out by the Scientific De-partment in the production areas. These data are plotted in Fig. 1 for fieldsand experiments planted with the varieties Valencia and Spanish Bunch (Texas)JNatal Common showed a much greater variability and there was no obviousrelationship between yield and plant number. The diagram shows clearly thatfor Spanish Bunch and Valencia a considerable increase in yield can be ex-pected with an increase in plant population. With further data a similarresult may well be obtained for Natal Common.This increase appears to be more marked on the experimental plots thanon the units, which would imply that the Departments staff, who were ableto give more systematic care to the plots, were able to secure a higher yieldper plant. Some of the difference may also be due, at least in part, to more efficient harvesting and picking; which was done by hand on the experimentalplots (owing to their small size) and by machine on the units. It should benoted that in this diagram the yields on the units have been adjusted for theestimated weight of nuts left in the ground.5 10 IS 20 25 30 35Fig.1.

175&apos;An experiment at the Kongwa Experiment Station, testing various plantpopulations, showed maximum yields in the neighbourhood of 50,000 plantsper acre. Populations of this magnitude cannot be realised in single rowplanting without crowding the plants unduly unless the row width is 18 in.pr less. Such narrow rows could not with present equipment and staff becultivated efficiently. The most efficient method of planting may consist of sowingpaired rows 6 in. apart, with 36 in. between the midpoints of pairs. These pairswould be treated as single rows in the later cultivations and harvesting. Fertilisercould be placed in a single band at the midpoint of each pair, a procedure whichmight result in a more efficient utilisation of the fertiliser.In general, the evidence shows that the achievement of a high plant population is of the first importance. It may prove to be more critical than any other factoraffecting yield per acre in the Kongwa Region. This may also apply to the other areas.Following the population survey, experiments were set out at the KongwaExperiment Station to measure the effect on groundnut germination of a numberof possible adverse factors. Where planting was followed by a wet period the germination was 46 per cent.; but where conditions after planting weredry, the figure fell to 19 per cent. (In another experiment, which was carried through to harvest, yields of Spanish Bunch were reduced from 1,094 to 845lb. kernels per acre by dry post-planting conditions.) Natal Common withstooddry post-planting conditions better than Valencia, giving 26 per cent, germinationas against 13 per cent, for Valencia, although under wet post-planting conditions the two varieties gave similar values of 44 per cent, and 49 per cent, respec-tively. Under dry conditions, depth of planting made little difference togermination, but under wet conditions seed planted at 4 in. gave 40 per cent,germination only as against 53 per cent, at 2 in.Date of plantingIn the 1947-48 season no planting was possible on the Kongwa ExperimentStation until December 24, owing to late clearing. Planting had, however,begun on the main fields on December 15, and there were areas in whichrain adequate for germination had fallen as early as December 3. Con-sequently, the planting date trial conducted at the Kongwa station does not fully represent the range of planting dates possible. In this experiment, fivevarieties Spanish, Natal Common, Valencia, Virginia Bunch and a local mixedvariety known as Kongwa (equivalent to Mgogo in certain Unit records) were sown on four dates, December 24, and January 2, 14 and 28.The results are overwhelmingly in favour of early planting, particularly forthe varieties which tend to the runner type. The three varieties best suited to the Kongwa conditions are Valencia, Natal Common and Spanish. Theweak adherence of the mature Valencia pods to the vine makes mechanicalharvesting difficult. Virginia Bunch is clearly better adapted to areas of longerseason, while the Kpngwa variety which, being mostly a runner, is not readilyhandled with the present equipment is probably of most use as a source ofbreeding or selection material adapted to local conditions. This applies par-ticularly to the more upright component of the mixture, which may be aValencia strain. The full evaluation of the results of this experiment is presented in section 12. It may be summarised by saying that the runner and semi-runnervarieties, Kongwa and Virginia Bunch, yielded about 1,500 and 1,600 lbs.kernels per acre at the earliest planting, 1,200 and 1,000 lbs. at the second, andthen fell off sharply ; while the more upright varieties, Natal Common and spanish, which can use a shorter season, yielded 1,200 and 1,300 lbs. kernelsper acre at the first planting and were still producing 1,000 and 900 lbs. kernelsper acre at the third. Valencia probably behaves similarly, with a slightly greaterpreference for early planting, but the results in this particular experiment wereobscured by large and probably fortuitous variations in plant population. Itshould be pointed out that the fourth planting took place early in the mid-seasongap in the rains, which in the 1947-48 season lasted for five weeks. This is undoubtedly responsible at least in part for the poor stands, and so for the pooryields at the last date, but it is shown in section 12 that the yielding capacity perplant also declined with the late plantings.

Oil yields varied in the same way&apos; as kernel yields, the average at the firstplanting being 544 lbs. per acre and at the last 220 lbs. per acre.At Urambo, experiments on both red and grey soil compared mid-seasonand late plantings of Virginia Bunch, Natal Common, Spanish Bunch andValencia groundnuts. The relevant dates were 6th and 16th February for early and late plantings on the grey soil, and 14th January and 11th Februaryfor early and late plantings on the red soil. All these plantings except theearlier one on the red soil were later than any at Kongwa, and too late forsatisfactory yields, particularly in a season in which February was distinctly dry.Even so, the decline with, later planting was shown for all varieties. Atthe early date, yields varied on the red soil from 600 lbs. kernels per acre(Spanish) to 1,000 lbs. (Valencia), while at the later date the best yield wasunder 400 lbs. (Valencia). On the grey soil, Valencia, the best yielder, pro-duced only 400 lbs. at the early planting, and 300 lbs. at the later.When the effects of varying plant populations are roughly eliminated fromthe yields, by the somewhat crude device of calculating the performance values(yield per 1,000 plants), and these values are plotted against planting date,characteristic falling curves result for all varieties (Fig. II). The mean curvefor Urambo (neglecting for this purpose the difference between red and greyBoil) has the same slope as the mean Kongwa curve, indicating that theplanting date/yield relationship is to some extent independent of the climaticdifference between Urambo and Kongwa (section 12).&apos; It is therefore reason-able to suppose that earlier plantings at Urambo would have given consider-ably better yields, particularly since good rains fell there in late december and January. This also explains the poorer results generally obtained on thegrey soil on which no plantings were possible owing to excess of water until29th January.Cultivation methods and harvestingThe effect of ridging was tested at Kongwa in a hand-planted experimentwhich compared ridge planting, flat planting and planting in the furrow.(Other treatments, whose effects were negligible in this experiment, tested limingat different rates and broadcast application of P2Os.)  The results were as follows in lbs. kernels per acre adjusted for plant number variations:Ridge planting ..       ..       ..      ..      1,161Flat planting    ..      ..      ..      ...      ...    1,028Furrow planting        ..      ..      ..      ..        786Standard Error i 34-8 lbs.Ridge planting is significantly better than flat planting and flat planting issignificantly better than furrow planting. The ridged plants escaped the water-logging in early stages of growth which affected the flat and furrow plantedplots. It would, however, be unwise to recommend ridge planting on the resultsof a single experiment, particularly as it would make impossible the very valuableearly harrowings on the fiat.Late ridging on Virginia Bunch nuts, at Kongwa, had no effect on yieldsbut facilitated harvesting.In addition to improving yields, early ridging after planting and harrow-ing on the flat will probably be of value in aiding harvesting on compactingsoils, such as the Kongwa red type, and will help in water conservation andin erosion control, particularly when it is combined with tie ridging (basinlisting), a practice which under dry land conditions at Ukiriguru in the LakeProvince of Tanganyika, has given striking benefits. Further, in the wetter areasridging may well help to reduce the dangers of excess water. So far as can beseen at present, the method of planting outlined above, using the twin rowtechnique on the flat, should be immediately preceded by a light harrowing and immediately followed by another. After ten days or so, a further light harrow-ing should be used to knock down weeds, and subsequent cultivation shouldridge up the double rows, so that they come to harvest on either side of a ridge.Harvesting would then consist of breaking down the ridge rather than as at

present digging into a flat more or less compacted soil surface. The problemof harvesting from the ridge would be similar in many ways to&apos; that involvedin the mechanical harvesting of potatoes with a broad flat share, as in the Oliverdigger. It is hoped that equipment for the experimental investigation of these suggestions will be available in the coming season. It may prove necessaryto follow the harvesting operation closely by ploughing in order to prevent com-paction, but there is also the possibility that harvesting from the ridge will of itselfhelp to eliminate compaction, since compaction seems to be in part a con-sequence of the drying-out of the soil on the flat. These suggestions are naturallytentative at the present stage.Groundnut varietiesWith the co-operation of the Tanganyika Territory Department of Agri-culture, the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation (Nyasaland), Mr. J. Sellschop(Potchefstroom College of Agriculture, Transvaal, South Africa), and numerousother departments and individuals in all parts of the world, a considerable numberof varieties of groundnuts were represented in the variety collection at Kongwain the 1947-48 season.The principal variety trial tested 21 varieties or strains of varieties, some beingplanted both with and without hand-picking of the seed, The varieties includedSpanish Bunch, four types of Valencia, two types of Natal Common, VirginiaBunch, Kidang (from Java), and three types Of Manyema, from among the moreupright types, and eight runner and semi-runner types from various parts of tanganyika. Planting (in 28 in. rows at 5  in. spacing) and all operationsup to and including the digging of the bunch varieties, were conducted withstandard machinery. 1Apart from the Valencia type, which was unerringly picked out and damaged by wild pigs from among the randomised plots, all varieties yielded well. Ofthe upright types, which averaged 1,150 lbs. kernels per acre, Spanish gave957 lbs. kernels per acre for partly shelled unpicked seed, but proper shelling andpicking raised this figure to 1,138 lbs., partly by increasing plant population.Natal Common figures ranged from 1,000 to 1,300 lbs. per acre. Virginia Bunchgave 1,268 lbs,, and Kidang just under 1,000 lbs. The Manyema types averaged1,200 lbs. Runner and semi-runner types yielded from over 1,100 to 1,500 lbs.per acre, with an average value of over 1,250 lbs. kernels per acre.Twenty other varieties were planted in multiplication rows.The experiments confirm the broad suitability in the Kongwa Region of thepresent main varieties, particularly Natal Common. They indicate, however,that some of the other introductions, particularly Manyema Bunch, havepromise. In general, the conditions of the main experiment were favourableboth in respect of weather and of soil conditions, the nuts having been very carefully picked off by hand. There is no reason, however, to expect that similarlevels of yield could not be obtained generally in practice, under good conditions,although under more adverse conditions greater differences between varietiesmight have emerged. Some of the Tanganyika varieties of Valencia showedconsiderable vegetative vigour, which marked also the varieties Japanese andKidang. There is evidently a wide field for selection and breeding studies in thegroundnut crop, particularly for the development of varieties well suited to themore humid longer season conditions of the Southern and Western Provinces.Oil content of groundnut varietiesAnalyses of samples of kernels from the main groundnut variety trial showthat, in general, the oil content varies with the degree of uprightness of thevariety, being highest in the more upright (bunch) varieties, and lowest in the true runner types. The following table shows the main results of this trial inrespect of yield of kernels per acre (summarised above), oil content, and yield of oil per acre. The oil content values can be strictly compared, since they havebeen obtained from a statistically. designed experiment conducted under re-latively uniform conditions, and not merely by the analyses of samples of differentvarieties grown in production areas or under other uncontrolled conditions.

178fable 4. Kernel Yields, Oil Content and Oil Yields of the more importantGroundnut Varieties, Kongwa, 1947-48 SeasonVariety	Habit	Kernel yield (lbs. per acre)	Oil content (per cent, of kernels)	Oil yield, (lbs. per acre)Spanish Bunch......	upright	1,048	48-3	506Natal Common	upright	1,170	47-8	559Valencia&quot;	bushy upright	 	45-4	 Manyema      ......	bushy upright	1,199	45-9	539Virginia Bunch	open upright	1,268	40-3	511Runner and semi-runner				types ...		1,267	41-4	524The higher kernel yields of the runner types in this experiment are roughlybalanced by their lower oil content, so that average oil production per acre issimilar for the various types.Additional results for other varieties will be found in Section 14.Since the less upright varieties are in general adapted to longer seasons than are experienced at Kongwa, it is not unlikely that the lower oil content of theirkernels, compared with those of the shorter season upright types, may be due tothe higher proportion of immature nuts of lower oil content occurring in the produce at harvest.   This matter is to be investigated further.Effect of heat treatment on free fatty acid content of groundnut and sunflower oilIt was suggested during the season that a significant part of the free fatty acidcontent of the oil from commercial shipments of groundnuts or sunflowers reach-ing the U.K. might arise from the action of fat-splitting enzymes, (Upases) presentin the cells of the groundnut kernels or sunflower seeds. Should this be thecase, it should be possible to secure reductions in free fatty acid content by heatingthe seeds or kernels before shipment sufficiently to inactivate the lipases.This matter was examined by Professor T. P. Hilditch, D.Sc, F.R.S., of theDepartment of Industrial Chemistry, Liverpool University. Samples of ground-nuts were taken from freshly-dug plants and from sun-cured plants, and heattreatment (700 C.) was applied to both shelled and unshelled portions of thesun-cured sample. These portions were further sub-divided and parts of eachwere sent to England by air freight and by parcel post to provide a contrast of transit conditions.The results showed that in all cases the oils were uniformly light in colour,with very low free fatty acid contents, and of very high quality. It may be concluded that lipase action is of no importance provided the groundnuts are carefully harvested, well dried and shelled and shipped in such a wfCy as toavoid mechanical damage. This last condition is difficult or impossible torealise in large scale practice; but it is probably of great importance sincemechanical damage will not only liberate any fat-splitting enzymes which arepresent in the nuts, but will also permit attack by moulds and insects leading to the development of free fatty acid. Further, even if fat-splitting enzymeswithin the seeds were eliminated by heat treatment^ mould and insects attack would still follow mechanical damage, so that it seems unlikely that heattreatment would be of any value in reducing free fatty acid content of the expressed oil.* All Valencia plots were badly damaged by wild pig, and yield figures are accordinglyomitted from this Table.

Similar conclusions were reached in the case of sunflower seed, of which,heated and unheated samples were sent by air and sea.7. ALTERNATE CROP STUDIESThe original White Paper, on which the Scheme is based, suggested a rotationconsisting of two consecutive years of groundnuts followed by two years of agrass ley. The ley was intended primarily to improve soil structure by rootaction, in accordance with the results of research in Uganda. From work atUkiriguru, such effects are less likely on the more sandy soil types whichcharacterise a considerable part of the Corporation^ areas in Tanganyika. Also,the economic use of the grass ley involves the building up of cattle herds and ofwater supplies. Nevertheless, on the heavier, compacting soils, crop residues androot action may have a considerable part to play.It is also economically desirable to increase the proportion of cash crops in. the rotation, and it was accordingly decided at an early stage to devote a con-siderable volume of work to studies of other rotation crops and to investigate thotechnical possibilities of rotations with a high proportion of cash crops. In the season under review, a wide range of crops and varieties was planted on experi-mental plots, mostly in the Kongwa Region.SunflowerAt Kongwa, two mid-January plantings of the Hungarian dwarf variety yielded1,160 and 1,320 lbs. seed per1 acre, and Pole Star and Saturn, also planted in mid-January, gave 1,255 and 1,153 lbs. per acre. Other varieties planted at thesame time gave from 450 to nearly 800 lbs. Later plantings of Hungarian,towards the end of February, gave much poorer yields, probably due in part todrought.A variety trial planted almost at the end of the rains in mid-March gave yieldsranging from 350 (Hungarian) to 136 lbs. seed per acre (Sunrise). Pole Stargave 260 lbs. and Advance Hybrid 170 lbs. These results are not of directeconomic interest except in so far as they confirm the greater suitability ofHungarian and Pole Star to the conditions of the Kongwa area.A second late-planted experiment (8th March) compared drilling at 2 and 6 lbs.seed per acre with broadcasting at 37  and 75 lbs. per acre. All yields were low,the best being 280 lbs. per acre at the 6 lbs. level. Two lbs. of seed gave 217 lbs.per acre of cropland the broadcast treatments gave 173 lbs. and 122 lbs. for 37 and 75 lbs. respectively. A larger scale broadcasting trial at similar rates gave200 lbs. per acre.In the 1947-48 season, all plantings at Kongwa later than mid-January gavepoor results doubtless owing partly to the arid conditions throughout February,and the somewhat early cessation of the rains. It seems clear that even in normalseasons the results of March planting of sunflowers will be uncertain, except inso far as subsoil reserves of moisture can be built up, on which the crop can drawin April and May. It is known from Rhodesian experience that a good sunflowercrop can be produced on as little as 6 ins. of rain on favourable sites. Much will depend on correct choice of variety and the determination of the optimum spacing.At Urambo, sunflowers were planted on experimental plots on both red andgrey soils. They all showed conspicuous signs, such as yellowing and earlyshedding of leaves, of nutritional, perhaps nitrogen, deficiency. Nevertheless,yields in excess of 600 lbs. per acre were obtained from Hungarian, Pole Star,Saturn and the grey and black seeded Varieties. At Namanga, Saturn (359 lbs.per acre), Pole Star (382 lbs. per acre), and Black seeded (488 lbs. per acre) werepromising.   All plantings were late.Oil content of sunflower varietiesIt has not been possible to secure strictly comparable data for sunflower oilcontents in the same way as for groundnuts (p. 116).  However, a considerable

number of analyses have been performed, the main results of which are shownin the following table:  Table 5. Percentage of Oil in Sunflower Seeds (Undried), Kongwa,1947-48 SeasonVariety	Oil per cent, of seeds	Variety	Oil per cent, of seedsHungarian       ......	26-7	Jupiter  ......	28-2Advance Hybrid......	29-9	Saturn   ...	26-6Sunrise   ...     ......	290	Southern Cross ...	26-5Black seeded     ......	26-8	Grey seeded    ......	26 0Pole Star......	28-9		Further data are given in Section 13.Effect of heat treatment of seed on free fatty acid content of sunflower oilSee p. 117 (Section 6).SorghumSorghum is one of the most important grain crops of tropical and sub-tropical countries, and much selection and breeding work has been done on it.Sorghum varieties show a marked degree of local and climatic adaptation, sothat in selecting types to be grown in a new area the preliminary testing of a verylarge number of varieties is usually necessary. A considerable collection of types(mostly dwarf) was assembled during the season from Tanganyika, Kenya, SouthAfrica, the Sudan, Queensland, the United States, and the Argentine. Observa-tion plots were planted in January, February and March at Kongwa, and at various dates in the Western and Southern Provinces. In the latter two areasall plantings were late and also showed signs of severe nutritional deficiency(possibly of P2Ob or N) so that no conclusion can be drawn from the results.At KongWa the crop did best when planted in January and february and March plantings all yielded relatively poorly. This may well be due tothe extremely long dry spell which lasted until the end of February. Thesolitary exception was the Sudanese Feterita Managil which gave 705 lbs.per acre in 168 days when planted on 5th February.In the January planting the most successful varieties were the east african Semi-dwarf types Dobbs (873 lbs. per acre in 139 days) and BuhuraMahemba (939 lbs. per acre in 179 days) the Sudanese dwarfs Feterita&quot;Managil (1,060 lbs. per acre in 114 days) and Dwarf Hegari (760 lbs. per acrein 113 days), the Queensland dwarfs Kalo (1,420 lbs. per acre in 121 days)and Wheatland Milo (1,210 lbs. per acre in 121 days (see below)), the Ameri-can Dwarf Kafir 44-14, a new type from Oklahoma (1,320 lbs. per acre in115 days), and the Argentinian giants Minnesota (2,040 lbs. per acre in 114days) and Azucarado Akafirado (1,760 lbs. per acre in 114 days).The. possibilities Of increasing these yields by use of fertilisers and by establishing the optimum plant populations were not investigated in 1947/48,but they may be considerable.The Queensland varieties were outstanding in respect of uniformity andadaptation to combining. Like other varieties with small glumes and exposedgrain, they were very heavily attacked by blue plant-sucking bugs (Calideadregei), which makes their encouraging yield even more remarkable. Itseems reasonable to expect that when the intensity of attack by this pest ha9been reduced (by control measures or selection) many of the dwarf types will prove to be high yielders of great value in the drier areas of East Africa.Soya BeanA wide range of Soya bean varieties was tested at Kongwa. Most ofthem came from the United States, but two varieties were received fromBatavia.

181The American types all flowered and set seed when very small not morethan 6 inches to 8 inches high-and it is possible that this may be a response tothe tropical day-length, which is short by comparison with the length of summerdays in the regions of the United States where soya is grown. Most of theyields were poor, but Red Tanner and Ogden yielded 530 and 455 lbs. per acre respectively in about 90 days from early February plantings.The Batavian Kedele types which were planted at the same time (February,1948) grew vigorously and sturdily up to 18 inches in height, and thenflowered all down the stem. The Kedele yellow variety yielded 500 lbs. per acre of well-filled mature seed in 114 days, but the Kedele black variety, whichgrew very well but obviously had a longer growth period, yielded a smallquantity only of immature seed at the end of the rains.At Urambo, a number of soya varieties were planted late in February.Tokio (ex United States) yielded around 400 lbs. per acre in 103 to 130 days,but the outstanding performance was that of the Batavian Kedele black, which gave 840 lbs. per acre in 122 days.It is evident that the Batavian types deserve much further study.All soya plantings were made with inoculated seed.MaizeUseful trials of maize were possible in the Kongwa Region only. TheCentral Province is not, in the usual meaning of the phrase, a maize area.Plantings in the 1947-48 season were mostly failures through drought.Yet on observation plots a Tanganyika variety, Katumbili, gave 1,401 lbs.per acre in 129 days from a planting on 18th February,. and Hickory Kingproduced 1,236 lbs. per acre in 207 days from a planting on 21st December,in spite of being severely checked by drought in February. The most signifi-cant results were obtained from two short season yellow varieties, KenyaYellow and Yellow Bushman (from South Africa). These were planted on 3rd and 12th March respectively, on a site at the lower end of the Kongwaexperiment station and where, owing to the water conservation measuresdescribed above (3, Climate and. Meteorology) moisture conditions may havebeen rather more favourable than elsewhere, although the site was not in any sense swampy. The ability of these two varieties to form a useful crop in thecompletely dry weather of May and June was most impressive, and theyyielded 806 and 910 lbs. grain respectively in about 150 days. It seems clearthat the growing of suitable varieties of maize on carefully selected sites inthe Kongwa Region should receive further attention.Other CropsSafflower, planted in February, grew well, but yields were disappointing.The best figure was 453 lbs. per acre, given by Nebraska 79. The crop wassown in 28 inch rows, but in American dryland practice a wheat drill is com-monly used, giving far higher population. The low yield at Kongwa may thuspartly be explained by the poor stand, but earlier planting will also be tested.Castor oil. The castor oil plants found in cultivation in most countries are tall bushes up to 12 feet or more in height, and are perennials or biennials.They have spiny fruits which shatter when ripe, and since the plant is not anannual it may bear flowers and immature and mature fruit at the same time.For all these reasons the crop usually presents great difficulty in mechanicalharvesting. The firm of Mauthner, in Budapest, has, however, produced adwarf (2-3 feet) variety with smooth non-shattering pods ; and about half ofthe plants are true annuals. The Department was fortunate in securing asmall quantity of seed of this type from Mr. Sellschop at Potchefstroom. Ina first planting, at a wide spacing, made on 7th January, 600 lbs. of seed per acre were given at harvest, commencing on 14th April, a growth period of98 days. A March planting, made to increase seed stocks, yielded 154 lbs.to the acre only. When optimum population for this crop is known it seems likely that it will be of considerable value to the scheme, and it is the opinionof the Massey Harris technicians that it can be handled by the &quot;Clipper&quot;combine.1 ;9

Linseed. A poor stand yielded 150 lbs. per acre. The crop is difficult toestablish at Kongwa, but with very thick planting may be of value.Cotton. Two varieties, Ilonga and MU 18, obtained from the Empire CottonGrowing Corporation Stations in Tanganyika, gave 135 and 265 lbs. of seedcotton respectively per acre. The growth was vigorous and good, but until the crop can be economically mechanised it is of little interest at Kongwa, where inany case conditions are probably too dry.Niger oil. Seed of this crop was obtained from Southern Rhodesia, where itis in use as a green manure. The crop grew vigorously and covered the groundwell. Planting was on February .13, and the crop was ready on June 2, a periodof 110 days. The yields were 429 lbs. in one part of the field and 285 lbs. only in another. Further, the oil content was 26 per cent, only, against the usual valueof about 40 per cent. Seed of an Abyssian variety, with an oil content of 46 percent., has now been secured, and further trials will be carried out on account ofthe crop&apos;s ready growth and potentially high oil yield.Sesame failed through insect attack, but in any case the Nebraskan seed usedseemed ill-adapted to Kongwa conditions, perhaps on account of inadequate daylength.Various food legumes were tested, but were mostly failures owing to heavyinsect attack. The few tolerably good yields per acre were of chickpea (500 lbs.),dwarf beans (182 lbs.), Lubia beans (230 lbs.), and green gram (225 lbs.).Green manure crops. Lupins failed through insect damage, and beggar-weedgave about 200 lbs. per acre of seed from a poor stand. Sunnhemp gave a very good cover. Kavirondo fodder sorghum, Sudan grass (grain yield, 1,120 lbs. per acre in one case), Johnson grass (Sorghum alumum) (grain yield 1,580 lbs. per acre in one case) and Star grass (Cynodon plectostachyum) all did extremely well.Yellow manna arrived late, but grew vigorously and will be tested further next season. A planting of this crop on March 25 gave 186 lbs. per acre of grainin 87 days (harvest June 21). 1Dwarf millet (Panicum miliare) produced a small crop (220 lbs. per acre) of grain in six weeks, but probably it is not of practical importance at Kongwaexcept as a possible fill-in crop after an early-harvested main crop. It wouldbe difficult to mechanise. pBulrush millet, was a failure in the Kongwa area in the 1947-48 season, both innative production and at the Kongwa Experiment Station, owing to a failureof the rains at a critical period.Buckwheat was practically a failure, having been sown in dry weather, but alater broadcast plot showed promise.   Early planting should give better results.Sweet potatoes grow well in spite of recurrent insect attacks, but the cropwas completely harvested when ready by wild pigs.Thatching grass (Hyparrhenia sp.) grew well at the Kongwa Experiment Station,but the culms were not long enough for use as thatch. It will be tried again ina damper situation.Rotation experimentsA rotation experiment, testing 12 different rotations, was set out at Kongwa,but owing to the failure of some of the ciops planted, and to other factors,it is not to be continued in the 1948-49 season. It seems better to concentratefirst on establishing the correct cultural conditions in the various areas for a range of possible crops, by intensive experimentation. The results of this work could then be applied on a field scale as a tentative rotation policy, the while formaltests of various alternative rotations, and particularly of the best use of fertiliserin the rotation (which will in any case take a number of years to complete) couldbe instituted. The policy of the Department in these matters views the develop-ment of systems of farming, suited to the conditions of the various Regions inwhich the Corporation is interested, as the ultimate objective. To this enddetailed studies of the behaviour of as wide a range of crops as possible willbe pushed forward. The composition and testing of rotation sequences will thendevelop naturally and on a scientific basis from this work.

The question of the place of livestock in a mechanised semi-arid tropicalsystem of farming must of necessity be approached in the same way. The firsttask of the Corporation in this direction is the provision of animal products forthe feeding of .the European and African staff of the project. The development ofthe necessary herds and flocks, together with that of the food and water suppliesthey will need, is already under way. The experience gained from this workwill make it possible to consider whether long-term economic advantage is tobe expected from the incorporation of livestock in the main rotation policy, andto devise the necessary experiments.It may be said at once that the Department does not accept the view thatthe inclusion of livestock in the rotation is essential on technical grounds suchas the maintenance of soil fertility. Livestock are unquestionably needed fornutritional reasons, as suggested above, but the land required to maintain thenecessary numbers on each Unit is a small fraction only of the area of the Unit.It v/ould be most dangerous to apply preconceived or sentimental notions on thissubject, derived from experience in temperate or even sub-tropical climates tofully tropical and semi-arid conditions in Tanganyika without sound experimenta-tion and full proof that the proposed system would succeed technically and economically.8.   PLANT PROTECTIONWork in this field has been largely confined to the entomological investigationsconducted by Dr. Evans, since it has not been possible to secure an appointment to the vacant senior post of Plant Pathologist. However, Dr. Wallace, of the Tanganyika Territory Department of Agriculture (Coffee Research Station), andMr. Sellschop (Potchefstroom School of Agriculture); on visits to Kongwa, gaveinvaluable help on plant pathology.Plant PathologyGroundnuts. The virus disease Rosette, which is probably the most seriousdisease of groundnuts occurring in Africa, is dealt with under Entomology (below).Black or crown rot (Aspergillus sp.), was serious on some areas of Unit 2, at kongwa, and was present on Unit 1, where scattered individual plants were notedto be attacked at various stages during growth. On some of the wetter areasof Unit 2 it was estimated that up to 30 per cent, of the plants were affected.The incidence of the disease would appear to be correlated with inadequateburying of grass. Localisation of the disease to former grassland areas supportsthis view, but there are probably other factors such as local moisture conditions on lower lying areas.Leaf-spot (Cercospora personata Ellis) appeared on the mature plants just before they were ready for harvest, but probably caused little or no reductionin yield. A bacterial root rot of the main root some 2-3 inches below the collarwas also found.On certain areas it was suspected that a fungus attack on the early maturednuts during March caused them to germinate. At harvest time a count ofgerminated and ungerminated nuts was made on the varieties Natal Common,Spanish Bunch and Valencia in the 25 variety experiment at the Kongwa Experi-ment Station. The association of germination with either fungus or insect attackor with no obvious cause was recorded. The results show that a mean attack of 10 per cent, by fungi and 2 per cent, by insects had occurred, and - that approximately 15 per cent, of the nuts attacked by fungi or insects germinatedand only H per cent, of the healthy nuts. In the latter case germination was almost entirely confined to one variety, Spanish Bunch. It is clear that germina-tion is greatly increased by insect or fungus damage to the pods.An experiment to test the value of a range of seed dressings was unsuccessfulsince a-dry spell followed the planting of certain treatments and had an adverse effect on germination. It was, however, clear that certain treatments, includingtrimethyl thiuram disulphide dust, had a beneficial effect on percentage establish-ment.

MiSorghums. Grain smut, Sphacelotheca sorghi, and Head smut, 5. reiliana,were fairly common. Some heads infected with long smut, TelyposporiumEhrenbergii, were noted. Downy mildew, Sclerospora sorghi, and rust, Pucciniapurpurea, were common, but in view of the severe attack by insects experiencedby this crop it was not possible to assess the probable reduction in yield.Other crops. Streak was recorded in a small number of plants of maize onthe Kongwa Experiment Station. Spotting of the leaves of Niger oil plants byAlternaria sp. was fairly common, but was not destructive. A leaf rust attacked a late sowing of castor oil. None of these diseases occurred on a serious scale-EntomologyThe results of a detailed survey appear in Section 14 of this report.It is too early yet to decide what pests constitute definite threats to successful&apos;,agricultural production by the Corporation, but the following appear to meritclose attention.The most serious threat to groundnut production in the Central and Westernprovinces is the presence of Hilda pqtruelis in the area to be developed. Insecti-cidal measures against this pest might prove costly, and so cultural methodsshould be tried. This will mean the rigorous control of weeds on which the-insect can feed, in fields and windrows.In the Western and Southern provinces, Rosette disease of groundnuts is certain to be a major problem at least for a number of years. It is possible that whenthe bush is cleared infection may be limited to the boundaries. At present, theonly counter measure which can be adopted is close planting, at least in therows. It is hoped that research on the dry season host or hosts of the vector,on the natural reservoirs of the virus and on the epidemiology of the disease willprovide further methods, such as selective felling of alternate hosts in wind breaks,,drainage channels and uncleared areas of bush on steeply sloping ground.Successful sorghum production in all areas may depend on the centre! of thecentral-shoot-fly, stem-borers and perhaps the blue bug, Calidea dregei. Controlof the latter is again tied up with weed control, in this case of Hibiscus sp., whichflourishes on cleared but unplanted land. Should commercial varieties of Hibiscusbe grown the siting of the fields in relation to those of sorghum and sunflower will need careful consideration. It is possible that some varieties of sorghum maybe able to produce high yields in spite of high stem-borer incidence and thatcultural methods &quot;of limiting the population may be adequate, such as ploughingin the stems as soon after harvest as possible to kill the hibernating caterpillars^and adjusting the planting date to a period when the number of egg-laying mothsis at a minimum. Control of the central-shoot-fly may prove to be more diffi-cult, since it is quite possible that a high population exists in the indigenousgrasses.   Here again adequate weed control in fields and windrows may help.In view of the importance of bees for pollinating sunflowers and the consider-able reduction of nesting sites and colony size as a result of extensive bushclearance, it is possible that special measures will have to be taken to ensure asufficient supply of bees at the time when the sunflowers are in bloom.9.   MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES(a) Clearing Committee. In 1947 a committee was set up under the chairman-ship of the Chief Scientific Officer to consider the technical problems of landclearing at Kongwa and to conduct trials of the equipment available. The-Unit and Area managers and the Chief Soil Conservation Officer were members.The following broad conclusions were reached:  (i) Initial flattening must be selective. The bulldozers should not attemptto fell the large trees, but should leave them for special treatment^.By this means stumping can be reduced.

(ii) The rooting problem can only be attacked efficiently by machines which,combine a vertical and a horizontal cut. This condition is met by theDavis plough, which has proved very valuable at Kongwa; and itis interesting to note that the principle is incorporated in the newHarrison-Blaw-Knox root cutter.       ;(b) Experiments on tree poisoning. Sodium arsenite applied in frills tomiombo trees at Urambo was no more efficient in killing the aerial parts thansimple frilling without arsenite, but it remains to be seen whether the under-ground parts are killed. When applied in holes bored in the trunk arsenite was less efficient than frilling. Baobabs at Kongwa were killed by arsenite placed inholes at 18 in. intervals round the bole, the effect being that of ringing.(c) The Chief Scientific Officer acted for a time in 1947-48 as chairman of a.committee on building priorities.(d) The Chief Scientific Officer spent June, 1947, in the Gambia, West Africa,in connection with experiments on rice and groundnut mechanisation being con-ducted there by the Human Nutrition Research Unit, Medical Research Council.(e) Close and friendly relations have been maintained with the East AfricanAgricultural Research Organisation. The Soil Chemist is a member of theOrganisation^ committee on soil analysis. Members of the staff have visited theEast African Agricultural Research Station at Amani, the Tanganyika TerritoryCoffee Research Station at Lyamungu, Moshi, and the East African industrial research Board&apos;s Laboratories at Nairobi.(f) The Entomologist served on a committee on termite control in houses, setup by the Civil Engineering Department(g) The Department established and maintained nurseries for the productionof planting material of ornamental and economic trees and shrubs at Unit 1,.and later at Sagara, and plants of over 30 species were produced. Vegetable-seed and planting material of tropical fruit trees were secured for the southern province.(h) The Statistician prepared a report on the statistical needs of the scheme as a Whole. In particular, the statistics of labour utilisation and hospitalattendances were outlined in collaboration with departmental officers. A surveyshowed that on any one day about 10 per cent, of the individuals in the labour force were not thei persons whose work tickets they held. An exploratorystudy was made of the statistics of tractor performance.PART 2.   SURVEY RESULTS AND TECHNICAL DATA10. SURVEYSThe Catena at KongwaThe Kongwa Region is for the most part a rolling plain, with steeper slopesonly in the neighbourhood of the Kiboriani and Chinene hills, which bound itto the south and west, or of the inselbergs which stand out of it at many points..The topography is thus far more level than that of the classical home of the concept of the catena in the foothills of the Usambara mountains.The climate of Kongwa is arid, total rainfall being 25 in. per year or below,in a single rainy season of less than six months. The country dries up com-pletely in the long dry season, principally as a result of transpiration by theCommiphora scrub, and there are no permanent watercourses, the drainage beingalmost completely dead.The rocks of the area are principally gneisses of the Basement Complex. Thetwo types of major significance for soil formation are a pale granitic gneiss anda dark, often nearly black, hornblende gneiss. The granitic gneiss being theharder of the two types, tends to occur below, or even to outcrop at, the crestsof the gentle ridges, while the hornblende gneiss underlies the slopes.

This geological diversity naturally complicates the catenary succession. the soil of the crests pr ridges, which has been termed the Upland Pallid type, istypically a light grey, yellow, buff or even pale red coloured sandy loam, ofclay content insufficient to cause serious compaction on drying. The subsoil isoccasionally rather brighter in colour than the topsoil and there is frequently alayer of ironstained quartz about the granite. It would thus appear that thegranitic gneiss is relatively impermeable to water. This view is further supportedby the fact that wells, in the Kongwa Region, are entirely confined to uplandpallid soil areas, where they tend to occur in groups. Many of these wells, forexample those at Hogoro, have been excavated to a depth of forty feet ormore, and are used in the dry season by villagers, who often walk several miles to them. The soil of the areas in which the wells occur is often somewhatcoarse, with much iron staining of the larger particles and pebbles.Below the.upland pallid soils, in a typical traverse from crest to drainage line,are found the soils derived from hornblende gneiss. They usually exhibit atypical catenary succession. The first product of hornblende gneiss weatheringis probably a greyish skeletal soil, but this is seldom seen since outcrops of therock occur only on sites of geologically recent disturbance. The main products of weathering are a series of rich red loams with sufficient clay to compact them on pressure and drying. These constitute the Kongwa Red soil type, the various members of which differ mainly in mechanical composition.The red soils show no marked differences in appearance from surface to parentrock, although there is an increase in clay content, in some instances at least.Compaction on these types may be very severe, particularly where the soils havebeen beaten down by rain or otherwise compressed before drying out. Thecompaction typically affects only the first three to five inches of the soil, butthis is sufficient to constitute a major obstacle to dry season working. Theeffect of compaction can, however, be reduced by breaking the soil before it driesout at the end of the wet season.&quot;Below the red soils, on the long gentle slopes, lie a range of paler types,in which the top soil is brown, yellow or even grey, and is more sandy in texturethan the mature red. These mechanically fractionated and transported types arenot very extensive, and are of greater pedological than economic interest at kongwa.The lowest levels of the catena are represented by the Valley soils, a group ofdrainage line and former lake bed soils, covering many thousands- of acres-These range in colour from rich brown to black, and in texture they are heavysilty loams to stifj cracking clays. Many of the black clays show the &quot; crab-hole&quot; phenomenon, presumably, where the infilling of dry season cracks withcoarse material has prevented them from closing completely when the soilsbecome wet. The pressure of the clay then appears to force up the soil betweenthe cracks so that a very broken appearance of the surface results. The majorityof these soils contain calcium carbonate, either as nodules or, in the case of old.lake beds, in massive form with fossil inclusions. Some, particularly the blackcracking clays, are saline.It. is clear that in earlier times bases have been leached from the soils of higher elevation and redeposited in the drainage lines. There are no indications of former base accumulation in the upper soils. Thus, although the catenaas a whole was pedocalic in character, the main mature type was subject toleaching and loss of bases.At the present time with a lower rainfall (indicated in part by the dryingUP of the former lakes) and heavy transpiration by the Commiphora bush which covers the higher soil types, little or no leaching can occur. The upper soils areof distinctly high base status and crops on them do not in general respond toliming. It remains to be discovered whether there is in any of these soils a,profile zone of maximum pH or base accumulation as suggested by Milne-(1947).

The Catena at UramboThe soils of the Urambo Region belong to the Plateau soils group of Milne(1947).   They are derived from a granitic gneiss of the Basement Complex, in:country which was peneplanated in very early times and subsequently uplifted..Slopes are slight, the drainage is almost dead and many of the drainage lines,are infilled and wooded.  The miombo vegetation (Brachystegia-Isoberlinia openwoodland, &quot; trockenwald&quot; of the German authors) is apparently extremelyefficient in transpiration and dries out the soil, according to investigations bythe Tanganyika Tsetse Research Department, to about 20 feet.   In spite of a.rainfall averaging 35 in. per year over thousands of square miles, river drainageis relatively small.The parent granite is not often exposed, but around the rare outcrops greyskeletal soils are found. The mature type on the gentle, ridges is a rich redloam, which compacts to some extent on drying. At the foot of the profilemassive ironstone is often found lying on the granite and filling in the inequalities.in its surface. Useful deposits of nodular ironstone also occur in this type.Otherwise the appearance of the profile is uniform.Below the ridge tops the red soil type grades in to a series of buff, yellowand grey sandy soils. When they are first encountered, in a traverse fromcrest to hollow, these lighter coloured soils overiie at a few inches only abright red subsoil essentially similar to that of the higher red soil; but as th*drainage line is approached the top soil layer becomes thicker and the subsoilbegins to lighten in colour to pale red, to yellow and ultimately to grey. thus the changes in the top soil are followed lower down the slope by broadly similarchanges below. The subsoils appear, however, to be richer in clay materials thanthe. topsoils.The drainage line soils present a somewhat bewildering complexity of clays,,silts and sands, although their subsoils are all heavy and they are all dark incolour ranging from grey-brown to black. The presence of much sand or siltin the topsoils of some of them may perhaps best be explained by assuming:,that these catenas of extremely mature topography have been in process offormation for so long that the clay has been followed to the lower levels by themore slowly moving sand, which now overlies the finer material. Thus the mechanical separation has been followed by a redeposition of the various fractions-in more or less distinct layers, with the finer materials lower down.The Urambo country is poor in bases and there is no general accumulation of limestone in the soils of lower levels. The great termite heaps which occur in the neighbourhood of the drainage line margins are, however, base accumu-lating, as shown by analysis, and usually have a zone of calcium carbonate nodulesbelow them. This is particularly marked west and south of Ussinge, near theconfluence of the two main drainages of the region, the Ugalla and Malagarasirivers.II.   SOIL  FERTILITY  AND  FERTILISER  STUDIESTwo main lines of activity have been pursued in these-fields.  Some hundreds of soils were analysed by rapid methods, and 44 field experiments were set out to examine fertiliser and liming effects on the groundnut crop.   No fertiliserexperiments on other crops were carried out.Soil analysisSoil analysis has been confined to the estimation of pH and of certain plant,foods (Ca, P, K, Mg) extracted from the soil in two minutes shaking by 6.3NHC1. pH was measured in most cases by means of indicators, using bariumsulphate mixed with the soil to speed up sedimentation. A few determinationswere made with the glass electrode. Analysis of soil extracts was carried outby the following standard procedures. Ca was determined at first by a rough turbidimetric method, but later a more precise oxalate-permanganatemethod was used. P205 was determined by stannous chloride reduction ofphospho-molybdate, the intensity of the resulting blue colour being read on acomparator or on a Spekker absorptiometer.   K was determined by a rough

188turbidimetric cobaltinitrite method. Mg was determined coiorimetrically in acomparator by a Titan yellow method. The original rough methods are rapidlybeing improved.The results of the analysis of some hundreds of soils from the Kongwa area are summarised in the following table:  Table 6.

JThe pH and Ca and Mg values for the three main groups of soils illustratewell the accumulation of bases in the soils at lower elevations, and the figurestaken as a whole indicate the general richness in bases of the area, which is confirmed by the results of field experiments. The bulk of the P values are low,which is in accordance with the results of field experiments. It might be expected,however, that the more calcareous valley soils would give higher P values thanthey in fact do. This may reflect the inadequacy of acid extraction methodson such soils. An interesting further feature is the small group of high phosphatesoils in each soil type, possibly due to the chance sampling of old habitation sites,defunct termite mounds, or cattle bomas, in all of which phosphate tends to accumulate. It is noteworthy, too, that extracted Mg values in the soils, of higher elevations are of the same order as extracted Ca, and even in the vaileysoils represents 8 milli-equivalents of Mg as against 11m. eq. of Ca. The ratio of Mg to Ca is thus higher than is usual in British soils. K shows low valuesonly on the valley soils ; but this may be a defect of extraction and analyticalprocedures on high Ca soils.Only the grey soils at Urambo have been examined in sufficient numbers tojustify generalisation.   These show the following features.Of 16 samples whose pH was examined, 6 were between pH 4.6 and 5.5and 9 between 5.6 and 6.5, which range covers the more typical soils in thesmall number examined. Of 14 soils examined for phosphate 12 were below0.5 most. extracted P per 100 gm., the two remaining, soils showing valuesover 1.0 most./100 gm. Ca was below 25 mg./100 gm. in 7 of 14 soilsexamined and below 100 most. in the remainder, with only one high exception,over 300 most./100 gm., from a habitation site. Mg values were mostlyfrom 26 to 100 most./100 gm., and KaO lay between 5 and 12 most., no soilslow in this element being encountered. The overall picture is .of a light leachedsoil, very deficient in PaO, . and Ca., . but not acutely acid. The pHfigure has presumably been maintained at a fairly high level by the annualaddition of potash to the top soil in the fires which sweep through the woods inthe dry season.Four Urambo red soils examined show rather low pH values, three of thembeing below pH 5.5, with an extracted P below 0.5 most./100 gm., and bothCa and Mg below 50 most./100 gm. Potash values were all high, between9 and 12 most.K/100 gm. The rather lower pH of these soils, as comparedwith the grey soils, may reflect their heavier texture.The heavier red soils of Namanga, Southern province, give results very similarto the Urambo red soils, but here again the numbers analysed in 1947-48 werelow. More attention was devoted to the brown silty soils of Block B. Theseare only slightly acid, all values being above pH 5.6, while Ca values are all above 25 most./100 gm., with a mean value of 65 most./100 gm. K,0may, however, be low, the mean value being 6 most./100 gm.. with 5 soils outof 11 below 4 most./100 gm.Soil fertility experiments in the presentation of the results of these experiments, the yields have been adjusted so as to eliminate the effects of fortuitous variations in plant population from plot to plot. Where plant population was itself significantly affected bytreatment such adjustment is not permissible and has accordingly not been made.The method followed was that of Finney (1946).In the tables the following abbreviations have been used for varieties:  Valencia Val.Spanish Bunch Sp.Natal Common    N.C.Four types of experiments were designed to elucidate the main soil fertilityrequirements of the groundnut crop. Each of these types was repeated eighttimes in the production area at Kongwa, once on grey and once on red soils atUrambo and once on a heavy red soil at Namanga in the Southern Province(Block A).

190General exploratory experimentsThese experiments were intended to test the response of groundnuts to N,P205, K20 and CaO, and the effect of the placement drilling of N andP2Oj. The design adopted was a 2s factorial, the drilling treatment being treatedas a separate factor. Since drilling was not, in fact, combined with two of thefour remaining factors a number of dummy contrasts are introduced into the design, which complicates analysis and presentation. The levels of applicationof plant foods were :-Nitrogen:    Nil and 0-1 cwt. N per acre as sulphate of ammonia. -Phosphate: Nil and 0-5 cwt. P2O5 per acre as superphosphate.Potassium:  Nil and 0-6 cwt. K2O per acre as muriate of potash.Lime: Nil and 8    cwt. per acre of ground limestone from Sagara, Kongwa district.All K and CaO and half the N and P2Os applications were broadcast by hand.The remainder of the N and P2Os applications were applied through a standardplacement drill. Plot size was 4 rows (1 drill width) x 114 links or 0.016 acre.The results of the experiments at Kongwa are shown in the following tables:  Table 7.

P, Ca and Kwere determined in 2 minute 0.3 N HC1 extracts. P was determined by reductionof phosphomolybdate and measurement of blue colour on an electrophotometer.Ca was determined by a rough turbidimetric method for experiments 5, 11, 12,16 and 7a, and by an oxalate^permanganate method for the remainder. K was determined by a rough turbidimetric cobaltinitrite method.The most general and significant result is the response to phosphate. Thisis most marked where the fertiliser was placed and where nitrogen was not given.There is some connection between response to phosphate and extractable soilphosphate. Nitrogen has been ineffective, and the NP interaction is in most cases small or negative. There is only one significant positive NP interaction,on a soil very low in lime and phosphate, although not acid. Lime is effectiveonly on this soil (5), which bears out the general result of the liming experimentsset out below (page 134). The effect of potash is significant on one soil only (11)of low potash analysis. A second soil (34) of even lower extractable potash,did not respond to potash fertiliser but it was an alkaline soii of high calciumeontent, so that analytical results may not be reliable.rAt Urambo one experiment of this type was conducted on red soil and one on grey. The experiments were both planted late on somewhat uneven ground.Owing to wet conditions at planting time, the placement machinery couldnot be used on the grey soil and nitrogen and phosphate were applied to place-ment plots by hand along the rows.At Namanga a single exploratory experiment, on heavy red loam, was setout. A very poor stand was established, and the local staff, in an endeavourto save the experiment, planted up the gaps with fiwi bean (Dolichos lablab).At harvest, groundnuts and fiwi bean were taken separately, the latter beingweighed green. Owing to a series of mischances, no data for groundnuts canbe presented, but the fiwi bean figures give some indication of the likelydeficiencies of the soil. For obvious reasons they cannot be treated rigorouslyand no standard error has been computed.The results of these experiments, together with relevant soil data are presented in Table 9.

The Urambo grey soilhas provided no response to P205 spread immediately above the seed, and there,is a nearly significant effect of potash.Experiments on types of phosphateThe response of the groundnut crop to a range of different types of phosphate-may be expected to throw light on several different problems. From thepractical point of view, materials cheaper per unit of P2Os than processedphosphates may be found. Secondly, information may be obtained on the-types of P compound which under&apos; the given soil conditions can yield P.Os to thegroundnut crop Thirdly, reactions between phosphates and the soil, leading toimmobilisation of soluble P2Os may be indicated.

133To gain knowledge on these questions, ten phosphatic materials were testedin a series of experiments. They were applied broadcast at 0.5 cwt. P2Os per acre, and compared with a superphosphate scale at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 cwts. P205per acre. Two plots receiving no phosphate were incorporated in each of thetwo randomised blocks in each experiment. Plot size was 0.0125 acre. N dressingswere made up throughout to 0.117 cwt. per acre with sulphate of ammonia,,andlimestone at 8 cwt. per acre was given, to all plots on sites where analysisindicated a possible deficiency- of Ca.The materials tested, the water and citric solubilities of the phosphate theycontained, and the mean response in six experiments at Kongwa are shown inTable 10.The ammonium phosphate was Canadian ; the mixture of sulphate of ammoniaand triple superphosphate was a commercial mixture prepared in Holland ; thenitrophosphate was prepared experimentally at R.O.F. Pembrey, Wales. TheUganda rock was a sample from Tororo in Uganda, and the soda phosphatewas prepared from the same batch by a rotary kiln heat treatment at thelaboratories of the E.A. Industrial Research Board in Nairobi. Gafsa andChristmas Island rock phosphate were the normal commercial products fromthose places. Saphos is an &quot;Egyptian rock phosphate similar in many ways toGafsa, and the Gafsa plus superphosphate mixture was made of equal parts \ byweight of the two components.Table 10.

The superphosphate scale isvalueless, but it is of some interest that the average responses to the materialsdecrease roughly in order of decreasing citric solubility of the phosphate they-contain. The order of the response to 0.5 cwt. water-soluble phosphate, broad-cast, is similar to that obtained in the general exploratory experiments at kongwa.At Urambo, on the grey soil, yields in the corresponding experiment werelow and responses not significant, with the exception of an apparent depres-sion of yield by Christmas Island rock phosphate. This accords with theresults of soil analysis. On the Urambo red soil, although there was some indication that certain of the water-soluble materials were effective, results were very variable and no responses were significant. At Namanga, the fiwibean fresh weight, figures (see page 129) show large responses to many of the materials.* Effects of this size are not likely to arise by chance in more than 1 in 20 cases,t ,,        ,,1 in 100 cases.

a196Although the results are somewhat variable, there is some tendency forresponses to be lower at the lower rates than would be expected from the response to the top rate. It is noteworthy that the response at top rate issimilar to that obtained in the exploratory experiments at the comparable rateof placement of N and P.Results for groundnuts of Urambo and fiwi bean weights at Namanga showsimilar trends:-Table 14.-Results of Experiments on Rate of Application of StandardFertiliser at Urambo and Namanga, 1947-48Centre        ...Soil typeCrop ...Unit......Plant No?

The limestone and gypsum were placed using standard equipment witha modification to make the application of the middle rate possible. To place thehighest rate it was necessary to run over the plots twice, delivering half theapplication on each run, and sowing seed on the second run. . These experiments,also served to give further information on the lime requirements of the soils.The limestone used was a lacustrine magnesian limestone from Sagara, Kongwadistrict (CaO 40 per cent. MgO 3.2 per cent.), and it was applied at 2, 4 and cwt. per acre. Gypsum, from Mkomazi, Korogwe district, was applied at rates,calculated to give equivalent CaO. The design used was a 3x3x3 design in three blocks, plot size being 0.014 acre. The results at Kongwa are shown in.Table 15.Table 15.

19In the absence of any effects of either calcium supplying material, there is no need to examine the data in further detail. It is clear from results and fromthose of the general exploratory experiment that calcium need only be suppliedat Kongwa at extracted values below about 20 most./100 gm. or 1 m. eq./100 gm.Since such soils are rare in the Kongwa Region, there is no case for a generalpolicy of liming at Kongwa.On the red soil at Urambo, no general response was obtained to either lime-stone or gypsum. On the grey soil, however, there was some evidence that benefitwas obtained, particularly from limestone.   The results were as shown in Table 16.Table 16* Results of Experiment on Calcium Nutrition of Groundnuts, UramboGrey Soil, 1947-48(Yield : lbs. kernels per acre)Variety: ValenciaNo added Ca, 781 lbs. per acre	Ro	Ri	r2	MeanLimestone......	842	915	867	874Gypsum     ......	858	819	806	828Mean        ......	850	867	836	851	To	Ti	T2	Limestone  ......	929	806	888	874Gypsum     ......	712	896	875	828Mean        ......	821	851	881	851Ro 2 cwt. limestone or equal Ca as gypsum.

In this experiment the largest response tophosphate in the series, and the only significant response to lime, were recorded.Oil content was determined on duplicate 10 gm. sub-samples drawn from amain sample of 200 gm. of kernels, reduced for analysis by means of a nutmeggrater. Extraction was carried out with petrol ether (B.P. 40-60oC.) in standardSoxhlet equipment. The extraction was interrupted after some hours and thekernel residues were ground with sand in a pestle and mortar, subsequently being returned to the apparatus and further extracted.

The general tendency is for treatments to reduce oil content.This question was further examined by the analysis of kernel samples from three experiments, Nos. 7, 15 and 17 (Table 13), on the rate of application of standard fertilisers. In these experiments considerable yield differences were obtained, although only one was significant.   The results were as follows:  Table 18.- Kernel Yield (lbs. per acre), Oil Percentage and Oil Yield (lbs. per acre), Groundnuts, Experiments 7, 15 and 17, Kongwa, 1947-48	No added fertiliser	Response to  46        93        186 lb.*fertiliser per acre			Standard errors (responses)I.

This may account for the rather largedepressions of oil content by fertilisers, and for the large standard errors.Only in one case (Experiment 17) does a difference in oil content reachsignificance. In these experiments all but one of the fertiliser effects are negative,which reinforces the inference from Experiment 5. In all these experiments theeffects apparently produced by fertiliser treatment are small compared with those associated with varietal differences (see p. 142).. * Effects of this size are not likely to arise by chance in more than 1 in 20 cases,t Effects of this size are not likely to arise by chance in more than 1 in 100 cases.

9199Tentative general conclusion on soil fertility in the three RegionsThe evidence gained in 1947-48 would appear to indicate that the soils of theKongwa Region are not deficient in lime but tend to deficiency in phosphate.At Urambo the red soil is sharply deficient in phosphate but not acutely so inlime ; while the grey soil, at least at the lower levels, needs liming, but is notdeficient in phosphate. It would, however, be dangerous to apply this conclusion to all the grey soil at Urambo, since the site of the 1947-48 grey soil plot wason the edge of a drainage line. The red loam at Namanga is acutely phosphatedeficient and acid, and may well prove to be calcium deficient as well.These conclusions are broadly in accordance with the expected effects of the soil-forming factors operating in the Regions. The Kongwa soils are typical semi-arid steppe soils, while the Namanga soils and the ancient plateau soils of Urambohave been formed under conditions of heavy leaching leading to removal oflime, with acidity and low availability of phosphate.The extraction for two minutes with 0.3N HC1 has proved of some general usein indicating these conditions, at least where soil types have been repeatedlysampled and a general impression has become possible. It is not, however,claimed that the conditions of a particular site can be forecast with confidencefrom one or two samples.12. GROUNDNUT production the general results of experiments in this Section have been covered in fairdetail in Section 6. This section presents the more important experimental datain full with the minimum of discussion. Unless otherwise stated, all experimentswere machine-planted.Plant populationAn experiment was set out on a fairly typical medium red loam at KongwaExperiment Station, to examine the relationship between plant population andyield. Population was varied by reducing the spacing between rows, the planterspacing within the row being kept constant at 4 in. The design also incorporatedfactorial N, P20., and limestone treatments, broadcast on the plots and harrowedin shortly before planting. The layout used was a confounded randomised blockdesign in four blocks of eight plots each, plot size being .035 acre.Owing to heavy rain during planting, three of the 14 in. row plots were notplanted until some days later than the rest, under less favourable conditions,resulting in a lower percentage establishment and somewhat poorer growth.The vegetative development of plants in both 14 in. and 18 in. rows was noticeablyless than at the wider spacings throughout the season. This is reflected in the performance values.The results were as follows: - Table 19. Results of Spacing, Lime and Fertiliser Trial, Groundnuts,Kongwa Experiment Station, 1947-48Variety: ValenciaI.

The main yield differences are those corresponding to population

200differences. The best yield has been produced in the neighbourhood of50.000 plants per acre. The performance values (yield per 1,000 plants)evidently vary with population, but no detailed conclusions can be drawn fromthese results since the general form of the relation between plant population and performance is not known. It is evident on theoretical grounds, however,,that for more or less upright varieties, where lower population is less readilycompensated by greater runner growth, the relation cannot be simple.Planting conditions the more important results of the experiment testing a wide range of variablesin mechanical planting conditions and technique referred to on page 113 appear in Table 20. Planting was very late, on 13th and 26th March, and the experi-ment was not intended to provide more than germination data.Table 20.

The reasons for fluctuations in the Valencia figures, par-ticularly the low population achieved on December 24, are not fully explained.The exceptional decline in establishment of Spanish Bunch at the last dateaccords with general experience at Kongwa, which suggests that this varietyds more sensitive to dry conditions at or after planting than the others tested.The fairly uniform establishment of Kongwa throughout, by comparison withother types, may reflect an adaptation to dry conditions, although the quality of the seed was poor, leading to a generally lower population level. Theyields (section II) are strongly influenced by plant population, so that section IIcannot be interpreted alone. The behaviour of the varieties is best illustrated by the somewhat crude device of calculating . performance values (yield per1,000 plants), in section III. In the absence of information on the variation of performance&apos; values with population (which may be expected in general to have a sigmoid form), this procedure is evidently somewhat questionable,but it does appear to give a somewhat better picture of the essential differences in the reaction of the varieties to varying planting dates, than can be obtained by the direct examination of the yield data. The main error introduced isprobably in the direction of overstressing the significance of the high perform-ance value for Valencia on December 24.In general, the longer season requirements of the less upright types wouldseem to be well demonstrated. These types are potentially higher yielders thanthe upright types, provided they are planted early; but mid-season plantingsrob them of their advantages in this respect, while at late planting dates

2they are inferior. The upright types maintain their performance values until january 14, while those of the more spreading types are distinctly lower atthat date.The oil percentages show characteristic results (see below) related to varietyand growth habit, the more upright types having higher oil contents. Kongwashows an intermediate value as might be expected of a mixed stock. Oilyields within any one variety broadly follow kernel yields, though the tendency for oil percentages associated with the earliest and latest plantings to be lower than those associated with intermediate plantings seems fairly consistent. Onlyin the case of the earliest plantings did the oil yield of the long season varietiesequal or exceed that of the short season ones. These differences may, how-ever, be associated with differences in the proportion of immature nuts in the produce of the different varieties at harvest.At Urambo, experiments testing mid- and late-season plantings of Spanish,Natal Common, Virginia Bunch and Valencia groundnuts were carried out on both red and grey soils.   The results were as follows:  Table 22. Results of Time of Planting Experiments, Groundnuts, Urambo Greyand Red Soils, 1947-48Variety	Valencia	Spanish	Natal Common	Virginia Bunch	MeanI.

February was a dry month in 1948 at Urambo, and the inability of Spanish to withstand the dry planting;conditions is once again clearly shown. The fall in yield and in performancevalues with later planting is also marked.The performance values derived from these experiments, both at Kongwa.and at Urambo, are plotted against planting dates in Figure 2.It will be noted that the curves have in the main the same slope and are quite close to each other, even though the data are. drawn from different soiltypes in widely separated areas of differing climate. This may indicate thatthe poor groundnut yields at Urambo in 1947-48 are not necessarily representa-tive of what might be achieved by earlier and better planting.

20SAll yields in the experiment are satisfactory, partly owing to the good standsachieved. Planting was at 28 in. x 5i in. (theoretical population about 41,000%and was followed by good rains. The yield of runner varieties or varietiestending towards the runner habit (including Virginia Bunch) is distinctly higherthan that of upright types (due perhaps to higher plant population), but thisis offset, in this experiment, by the lower oil contents of the more spreadingtypes, so that oil yields per acre are fairly uniform. Valencia and Manyema,which are rather open bunch types, have intermediate characteristics. Thecommercial varieties Natal Common and Spanish are evidently superior to other-varieties in oil content, but it would appear that the conditions of the experimentwere sufficiently favourable for all varieties to yield well. Perhaps the mostdisappointing result was the relatively low yield (at a high plant population)of the very even variety Kidang, the vigour of whose early growth had been most encouraging.The following varieties were multiplied in single rows: Variety	Source	Oil content Per cent.Castle Cary bunch ...      ......

It was suggested duringthe season that this hydrolysis might in part be due to the action of lipases inthe kernels. If this were the case, heat treatment to destroy the lipases beforeshipment might result in the production of oil of lower FFA content and con- -sequently higher commercial value.This question was examined in co-operation with Professor T. P. Hilditch,.Department of Industrial Chemistry, Liverpool University.Three varieties of groundnuts, Valencia (V), Natal Common (NC), and spanish Bunch (SB), were studied.   Samples were taken as follows:  Treatment	Condition	Pods or	Heat treated (-f)	Sent by airSymbol	at harvest	Kernels	or not (-)	or surface post0	Freshly dug	Pods	   .

In colour and in low free acidity the oils from the &apos;cured&apos; nuts inseries 1 and 2 far surpass any raw groundnut oil which has hitherto been on the English market. If this can be maintained on the full scale, with corresponding care in avoiding damp and mould-infestation during storage and transport of the bulk deliveries, it will be an outstanding achievementand an &apos; eye-opener&apos; to the English groundnut oil trade.&quot; The specimens are a complete proof of the thesis that nature producesthe seed oils in an almost neutral colourless state, and that any deterioration-tion is due to bad and inefficient handling.&quot; 2. The three varieties submitted yielded oil of unusually high iodine- value.   If other varieties are being grown which give oils with iodine values of 85-90, it might be better, ceteris paribus, to concentrate on the latter.&quot;13. ALTERNATE CROP STUDIESSunflowersNo pure seed of any variety except the somewhat heterozygous Hungarianwas obtained sufficiently early in the season to have a fair trial. The seed ofother varieties used in the earlier plantings had been derived from the produce of a variety trial, and the evident unevenness of the crops was probably due to

outcrossing. Hungarian proved very uneven in ripening, some of the headsbeing green at a time when others had been fully dry for two weeks. Thiscreated serious difficulties in combining.The results from sunflower observation plots are given in Table 25.Table 25.

At Kongwa, late plantings in a some-what dry season gave relatively poor yields, but the January plantings were satisfactory.

2A late-planted (15th March) sunflower variety trial at Kongwa gave the follow-in g results:  Table 26.

P. Hilditch as part of an investiga-tion into the possible advantages of heat treatment of sunflower seed beforeshipment (see p. 116).Four samples were sent, all of the Hungarian variety, from a harvest in lateJuly, 1948.

So far itwould appear that heat treatment is unnecessary if the standards of harvestingand drying already achieved can be maintained on the production scale.

21214.  PLANT PROTECTIONEntomologyDuring the season the Entomologist carried out a survey of insect pests of crops in the Central, Western and Southern Province areas in Tanganyika. Thefollowing is the text of his report, the conclusions having already been presentedon page 122.Central Province(a) Groundnuts. The present position is satisfactory. Several species of insectshave been observed feeding on haulms, roots and nuts, but none has reachedepidemic population. Curl grubs were responsible for a loss of about 2 per cent,of the plants on certain areas of Unit 2, and various soil insects damaged about1 per cent, of the kernels on both Units. Caterpillars and young grasshopperswere observed on the haulm. A few small colonies of aphides were observedduring January, but these were exterminated by the larvae of Syrphids andCoccinellids.Only a few isolated plants showing rosette disease were found towards theend of the growing season. Neither aphides nor traces of a previous infestationwere found on any of these plants, but white flies and. leaf-hoppers were present on some. (In the Belgian Congo, white flies are still suspected as vectors ofrosette.) Rosette has thus been practically absent from both African crops andunit production of groundnuts at kongwa for two seasons, since very little rosette(and that late in the season) was seen in the very wet season of 1945-47.Hilda patruelis Stal., a leaf-hopper, feeds on the roots and underground por-tions of the pegs, and has caused serious damage in parts, of Tanganyika. Ithas been found on late-planted groundnuts and on leguminous and compositeweeds at. the Kongwa Experiment Station, on nearby flattened areas and on Unit 2.Although numerous eggs, both unhatched and hatched, have been found, nymphswere rarely present. It is possible that the dry condition of the soil during lateMay-June was unfavourable.(b) Sunflowers. Several species of plant bugs have been observed feeding onthe stem and back of the heads, but. no evidence of damage was seen.(c) Sorghums. Aphides were found in considerable numbers on the youngplants, but were later almost completely exterminated by the larvae of Syrphidflies. The later-sown imported dwarf combine varieties, and the local tall type,Buhura Mahemba, were* severely damaged by the larva? of a fly, Atherigonaindica infuscata, which bored into and killed the growing points of main shootsand tillers. This not only reduced the stand but also lengthened the growingperiod, since the plant had to produce new tillers, some of which did not inthe time available develop sufficiently to produce heads.The eariy-sown dwarf combine varieties at Kongwa Experiment Station, whichin 1947-8 . had standing bush down two opposite sides, were heavily damaged asthe grain was filling out by so-called &quot; blue bugs &quot; (Calidea dregei) which fed onthe maturing grain and stopped or held back its development. Damage was not so severe on plots in an area of former open grassland (on Unit 2), perhaps on.account of the greater distance of the crop from standing bush.The maturing heads of two later sowings of Feterita Managil and Martin&apos;sMilo, sown on 9th March, were not attacked by adult Calidea, which evidentlypreferred the adjacent sunflowers on which they were found in large numbers.Calidea bred in large numbers on a wild Hibiscus sp. which grew abundantly oncleared areas which had not been sufficiently prepared for planting. The close proximity of sorghum or sunflower to Hibiscus is evidently very favourable toCalidea. The adults first appeared on sorghum and sunflowers in March andfed on the developing heads of the two crops. When the ovaries matured inApril, they flew to the Hibiscus, on which the eggs were laid and the immaturestages fed. The adults of this generation returned to sunflowers chiefly, but were observed to feed on the developing pods of legumes, castor oil, cotton, safflowsr-and various weeds.

213All varieties were severely attacked by stem-borers. A survey on 7th April-showed that 70-100 per cent, of the stems were infested. Eventually the infesta-tion reached 100 per cent, in nearly all varieties. Very few heads were killed:in spite of the heavy borer attack and the varieties would have yielded wellwere it not for Calidea damage. The outstanding exceptions were the two plotsof Feterita Managil and Martin&apos;s Milo sown on 9th March. These had 50 percent. and 20 per cent, infested stems respectively, but the caterpillars found were so small that damage was neglible.The heads of sorghums which did not emerge completely from the boot wereoften severely damaged by caterpillars of the stem-borer and other moths. The .heads of varieties which have the grain tightly packed were damaged by eater-pillars of a small moth, Eublemma gayneri, but those of varieties with more-open heads were not attacked, perhaps on account of the different environmentconditions in these heads.Stem-borer infestations of 100 per cent, were recorded on several native farms,,but blue bugs were not seen.(d) Maize.  The several varieties grown were only lightly infested by borers.(e) Castor oil. Caterpillars caused serious damage to this crop, completelydefoliating the early-sown plants. Leaves, inflorescences and developing pods,were all attacked.(f) Sesame.   Flea beetles seriously damaged the seedlings and caterpillarsseverely damaged the remaining plants when they were setting seed.(g) Safflower.  No appreciable damage occurred, although some plots carrieda fairly high population of Aphides.(h) Cotton. Cotton-stainers appeared in numbers when the bolls had set and-some staining occurred.(i) Niger oil. This crop was not damaged by insects during the growth period,,but numbers of weevils were found in the ripened heads.(j) Soya bean. This crop was remarkably free from insect attack.(k) Lupins.  The plots on Units 1 and 2 were defoliated completely by eater-pillars when they reached the flowering stage.(1) Sweet potatoes. The six varieties under trial were completely defoliated.by hawk-moth caterpillars from the windrows. Several instances were observed,of the caterpillars adopting a diet of sunflower leaves and completing growth.(m) Various legumes. Cowpeas on the experimental plots were severely damaged by various caterpillars and brown stink-bugs at the flowering and earlypod stages. About 90 per cent, of the pods were totally or severely damaged.An earlier commercial sowing produced a fair crop, but damage was done bythe above insects and a leaf-eating beetle and its larvae in addition. Fiwi beanswere also damaged by caterpillars and brown stink-bugs. The yield of chick-peas was reduced somewhat by caterpillars which fed on the developing seeds.Pigeon-pea and sunnhemp were not damaged.Southern Province(a) Groundnuts. Rosette disease was generally present. On the 25 varietytrial the infection was estimated to be 1.000 plants per acre. Aphide infestationwas definite but slight. On native plantings in the Masasi area, the number ofrosetted plants varied between 250-3,250 per acre.(b) Sunflowers. At least eight species of plant bugs were feeding on this crop,and of these, three were breeding.   No damage could be attributed to them.(c) Sorghums. Damage by stem-borers was not so great as in the CentralProvince, and no blue bugs were seen. Central shoot-fly caused a considerable reduction in stand.(d) Maize.  No stem-borers were present.

Western Province(a) Groundnuts. Rosette disease was present and was estimated to have affected about 2,000 plants per acre. Hilda patruelis was found on leguminousand composite weeds.(b) Sunflowers.  Several species of plant bugs were found feeding on the crop,but no damage was done.(c) Sorghums.  Stem-borer attack was prevalent, but caused little loss of heads.Central shoot-fly reduced the stand considerably.15.

OPHTHALMIC services the diseases have been the usual ones encountered in England. No ophthalmicdisease of definitely tropical origin has as yet been encountered in any European.Among African and Asiatic patients the main work has been diseases. Out-patient attendances at Kongwa have been approximately 30 daily.All the usual ophthalmic diseases were encountered, purulent conjunctivitisbeing the most noticeable. Trachoma is estimated to be present in some 60per cent, of the non-European population (which compares favourably with eitherEgypt or Palestine).There was a reasonable proportion of injuries due to flying metallic splintersfrom the workshops and a few severe eye injuries due to the very sharp thorns,particularly in the tractor drivers clearing the bush.Thirty-three ophthalmic operations have been performed.The main cases of blindness in the African population are as follows:  1.

SPECIAL SURVEYS CARRIED OUT IN TANGANYIKA(a) Tuberculin SurveyIn March and April, 1949, a small tuberculin survey was carried out in theKongwa Region, with the assistance of Dr. Rosemary Jackson, a Colonial medical research worker employed in Tanganyika. The results of this survey are shownin the table below:  	Total Number Examined	Percentage * Positive	Percentage NegativeAll tribes    ......      ......	216	60	40Wagogo (all ages).........	112	38&apos;	62Wagogo (adults)    .........	92	43	57Wagogo (children 0-15)   ......	20	15	85Other tribes ...      .......	104	84	16* A positive reaction is interpreted as the production in 48 hours of a visible and palpablearea of oedema 5 mm. or more in diameter following the intradernal injection of 0-1 mlof    1     dilution of Koch&apos;s Old Tuberculin.100,000The inference from the above figures is that the Wagogo tribe, when removed from their normal environment and herded together in camps with members ofother tribes, will be in a relatively precarious position. It is, in point of fact,difficult to assess the real significance of this survey. The Wagogo were studied in their normal environment, and the figures for this tribe included both employedlabour and unemployed inhabitants of Kongwa village. It may thus be assumed that the figures present a fairly accurate picture of the degree of sensitisation ofthe Wagogo as a whole to the tubercule bacillus.(b) Nutritional SurveyA survey was carried out at Mkwaya Labour Camp on October 20, 1948, as some members of the hospital staff had complained of inadequate and poor quality food. The results below provide no evidence of either inadequate ordeficient diet.The survey was carried out among 50 employees who had worked at Mkwayafor a period of at least six months and were on the local ration scale.By comparison with the children and adults (non-employees) who had been examined at Kongwa village in a previous survey, the condition of the skin ofthe whole of this group was strikingly good. No cases of pharynoderma, frankor incipient, were seen. One case of cheilosis (2 per cent.) was seen, two cases(4 per cent.) of Bitots&apos; spots and one (2 per cent.) of circumcaneal injection. Allother findings were negative. The Labour Officer in charge volunteered theinformation that he had noticed a marked improvement in the condition of thelabour after they had been 2-3 months in the camp, particularly with referenceto the condition of the skin. The implication is that such cases of probablevitamin deficiency as were seen were, in all likelihood, regressive.1. Case Returns:Europeans    ...Non-Europeans
