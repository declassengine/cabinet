SCOTTISH affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandl think it right to let ray colleagues know thatthe protagonists of Parliamentary devolution are at presentvery active in Scotland;    but for the moment my view is thatno further action by the Government is called for,2. There have, of course, been nationalist parties ofvarious kinds in Scotland for a long time;    so far none ofthem has achieved a large membership or any great influence.Within the last few years a. new body, calling itself &apos;&apos;&apos;ScottishConvention&quot; has come into being.    It represents&quot;itself as all-party in character, although only the Liberal and CommunistParties are officially represented.    Its object is to&apos; bring-about a measure of Scottish Home Rule,   Since 19kl it hasconvened a &quot;National Assembly&quot;, to which has been submitted a scheme of Parliamentary Home Rule based on the NorthernIreland model but going, in certain respects, beyond it.This year the Assembly adopted a &quot;covenant&quot; - which it is claimed 500,000 people have already signed - pledging support for the policy of the Convention.   The promoters no doubt intend to submit the covenant in due course with as many signaturesas they can collect, and they will seek to time this so as to cause the maximum embarrassment before the General Election.3. The Labour Party in Scotland has, on several occasionsin the past, pledged itself on the question of a separateParliament for Scottish domestic affairs;    and, at the lastGeneral Election, by adopting the official model electionaddress issued by the Scottish council of the Labour Party?a number of the present Members did so specifically.   more recently there have been, demands at the Annual Conference ofthe Scottish Labour Parts?&apos;, and from other quarters, for an enquiry into the possibilities of Parliamentary andadministrative devolution to Scotland and into the financialand economic relationships between Scotland and the rest ofGreat Britain.   At the Scottish Labour Party Conferences,191+5-1+7, resolutions in favour of suoh an enquiry were carried; -but in &quot;191+8 the conference decided that a fair trial shouldbe given to the policy set out in the Government&apos;s White paper on Scottish Affairs (coroniand 7308).   At the Conference of thisyear the 191+8 decision was endorsed and a further resolution in favour of an enquiry was overwhelmingly defeated becausethe Party were determined not to allow this issue to confusethe real conflict at the General Election.1+, On the main question of Scottish Home Rule, I have,since I became Secretary of state, taken and expressed strongly the view that the present time is not opportime for its con-sideration;    and that indeed those who are pressing for it are doing Britain a dis-servioe abroad at a time when Britain&apos;s-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)secret*P*(Ii.9) 251 COPY NO.J1I2TH DECEMBER,  19^9CABINET

522united influence is a vital factor in the safeguarding of worlddemocracy.    I have indicated that the Government are anxious tomeet the reasonable desire of all Parties in Scotland for a closer oversight of Scottish affairs.   In pursuance of that policy, as set out in Command 7308, wo have arranged for theScottish Estimates to bo dobatod in the Scottish Grand Committee,and for the second reading of certain Bills to be discussedthere;    and through the setting up of the Scottish EconomicConference representatives of all the main bodies concernedwith the economic life of Scotland have been brought togetherunder my chairmanship.So far as they have gone, these arrangements aroaccepted as having worked &apos;well and fulfilled a need.5* As regards tho demand for an enquiry into the.financial and economic position, I havo so far resisted it onthe ground that what factual information there is reasonablyavailable at present is already published;   that the investigation of the financial relations between Scotland andthe rest of Great Britain would involve a serious diversion of effort and. would produce results necessarily based, to someextent, on conjecture;    and. that any further factual information about industry and commerce north and south of the Border must await the results of the Census of Production and the Census of distribution.   In the meantime I have undertaken to publishannually - and have done so for each of the past three years -a White Paper about Scotland&apos;s economic position in whichavailable statistics are set out;    and we have also arranged to publish in the near future a handbook outlining thepresent administrative arrangements for the conduct ofGovernment business in Scotland.6. The position of the other political parties is thatthe Liberals are committed to Home Rule for Scotland -and thatthe Conservatives are not.   The Conservatives&apos; position has just been explained in a document, obviously for use at theGeneral Election.   They reject the idea of a separate ScottishParliament at present, but promise to appoint a RoyalCommission to review the whole position as between Scotlandand England in the light of modern developments, and to makerecommendatiens.   What the recommendations are to be about isnot clear;   but the main campaign has been directed againstthe &quot;London&apos;&quot;&apos; control of the nationalised industries and of former local authority undertakings.   The Conservatives mean-while propose a second Scottish Minister of Cabinet rank whowould be mainly resident in Scotland, and would act as theSecretary of State&apos;s Deputy over the whole field.   They alsowant a third Parliamentary Under-Secretar:/ of state forScotland - probably in the Lords*.   As regards the nationalised industries - the establishment of which on a Great Britainbasis has been widely criticised in Scotland - they propose anall-Scottish Electricity Board answerable to the Secretaryof state;    a Gas Commission also answerable to the Secretaryof state, which would supervise and co-ordinate the work ofthe various gas undertakings - over which local authorities would be allowed to resume responsibility if they wanted to;a Scottish Railways Board somehow integrated with the british transport Commission;    and an independent Scottish coal Boardequal in status to the English Board.    In the case of civilaviation they contemplate some restoration of private enterprise and. promise an enquiry into the position including the questionof the development of Prestwick as an international airport.Prestwick has all along been made a symbol of nationalistagitation.

7. The subjects of Scottish Homo Rule and of a &apos;commission of enquiry %are&apos; bound to be widely canvassed atthe forthcoming General Election;    and, while our IVUPs, haveagreed to concentrate on the inter-party issues, I must reportthat in some cases I have persuaded them against their willand that some are genuinely apprehensive of this campaign.On the other hand, I anticipate that, with the Conservativedeclaration, the Press in Scotland will moderate their&quot;plugging11 of devolution,8* Subject to the views of my colleagues, my intention is to stand on the lino I have indicated inparagraphs h. jgil 5 of this paper,9* These campaigns obtain their success becauseinterest in the subject in Scotland is always present,widespread and sincere.    It is accordingly essential that every support should be given to the great body of reasonableopinion in Scotland which&apos; does not support drastic changes but which is liable to be shaken by any action which can berepresented as imposing on Scotland decisions in the making of which she appears to have had no real voice, or as being-designed primarily to meet conditions south of the Border,I hope my colleagues will keep this danger in mind and bevigilant when they are dealing with, matters affecting -Scotland,    I think it is also true to say that there have beenoccasions on which decisions concerning Scotland, which couldnot be questioned on merits, have been announced in a way which made it possible to misrepresent them.   My own Departmenthave a good deal of experience of the problem of xoresentingthings to public opinion in Scotland in the best light;and they will, of course, be very ready to co-operate at anytime in regard to the timing and form of announcements of scottish interest.A,W,Scottish Office, S.W.I.,12th December, 19^9,
