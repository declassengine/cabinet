&quot;fe^oAoJCaii       II&apos;       *t 8 H29313 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(h9)  2298TH NOVEMBER,  19k9CABINETFESTIVAL OF BRITAIN,  1951Memorandum by the Lord President of the council when the Economic Policy Committee and later theCabinet discussed the treatment of the Festival of britain in relation to the economic cuts, it was generally agreedthat we ought not to spoil the ship for a ha&apos;p&apos;orth of tar.I said (CM.(49)  6lst Conclusions, Minute 2(f))  that on this&quot;basis I was confident of being able to secure economiesamounting to 5600,000, and hoped that it might be possibleto reach the full saving of  1 million proposed by theEconomic Policy Committee.2. Since the meeting I have with great difficulty securedsavings of  700,000 in the gross cost of the Festival, and Ihave pressed strongly for the&quot;&quot; full  1 million.    In order tosecure any greater saving some large item would have to be dropped from the Festival programme, and the selection of theitem would constitutionally be a matter, not for theGovernment but for the all-Party Council of the Festival of britain.   I think my colleagues should know of the followingdifficulties which this course would involve.3. On the most favourable assumption the saving couldbe achieved by dropping the land travelling exhibition, as was suggested to me by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    the festival Council, again on the most favourable assumption,might agree to this, but the effect v/ould be that the citiesof Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Nottingham would be wholly cut out of the Festival Exhibition programme,  thusdepriving fully half the population of England of any reasonable access to any major Festival event.    This would almost certainly be regarded as a repudiation of theGovernment1 s assurance that the rest of the country as wellas London would be given a real share in the Festival events,and the storm of criticism which would arise in the midlands and the North would be very difficult to meet, and wouldseverely prejudice the atmosphere of goodwill without whichthe Festival cannot succeed.h* That is the most favourable assumption.    There is inaddition a real risk that the Festival Council,  or at any rateseveral of its key members, would resign if they were pressed to agree to a course which they would feel inconsistent withthe assurances of Government support on which they were willing to serve.   We could not prevent these resignations,and if they occurred they might have such repercussions onthe staff and on public opinion that the Festival would bedoomed to become a flop.COPY NO.

5- On the other hand, I learn that the chairman of theCouncil, Lord Ismay,  has,  since the last Council meeting,obtained the most categorical assurance of Oppositionsupport from Mr. R.A. Butler, and that Mr. Butler is willingto reaffirm this support publicly in the House of Commonsif a Government statement is made in the terais of the annex.6. I therefore feel, while most reluctant to foregothe last  300,000 of the saving in gross cost originallyenvisaged,  that the risks involved in pushing the matterany further would far outweigh any possible benefits.This need not affect the main objective of reducing the net cost of the Festival to the Exchequer:    this can equallywell be reduced to  9 millions by finding additional revenue ofat least  300,000.   This might be done, without prejudice to the principle that exhibits for the Festival exhibitionswill be chosen entirely on merits, by subsequently levying asuitable charge on firms whose products are chosen for exhibit ion,or by other -means.   Whatever objections in principle may be felt to this course by the Council of Industrial Designshould, I suggest, be re-examined in the interests of economy in public expenditure, and such a charge should be imposed unless the Festival Office can find an alternativeway of raising an equivalent additional revenue, and thusmaintaining the Festival&apos;s contribution of si million to the cuts in public expenditure announced.by the Prime Minister.7. I therefore ask the Cabinet;(a) to agree that the Festival contribution to the cuts announced by the Prime Minister shouldbe made as proposed in paragraph 6 above;(b) to agree that I should make a statement in theHouse of Commons in the terms of the Annex.H.M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.,8th November, 1949*

ANNEXFESTIVAL OF BRITAIN,  1951As I told the House in the Debate on the27th October, the projects originally proposed by theCouncil of the Festival of Britain, 1951* would have involved a cost to the Exchequer of about  14 million,   I had to insist on this figure being reduced,  and after discussion by the Festival Council in July cuts were made which reduced the total to  12, 300,000 .    Since then a further cut of 1 million has been imposed, as announced by the PrimeMinister in his statement on 24th October, giving a finalgross total of  11,300,000, which includes a margin for contingencies.   Against this, revenue is estimated at 2 million, without taking account of receipts for thedisposal of assets, giving a not expenditure, in round figures,of  9 million spread over this and the two coming financial years.    Substantial economies have been made in variousancillary services to the Festival exhibitions, but thefinal figure of  11.3 million has not been reached without some curtailment of the programme which had been envisaged.The various exhibition projects will,  however, go forwardbroadly as planned, and there will be no reduction in the indus-trial content of the South Bank and Glasgow Exhibitions.   I am satisfied that with enterprise, ingenuity and care the festival organisation will be able to put on a first-rateeffort for the money available.Of the gross expenditure,  10,035,000 will fall ohtho vote of the Festival of. Britain Office,  and  585,000&apos;on that of the Ministry of Transport.    The balance is made upby expenditure on account of the Festival by the Arts Councilof Great Britain ( 380,000),  the Council of IndustrialDesign ( 285,000), and the British Film Institute ( 15,000).The principal item of expenditure by the Festival of britain Office will, of course, be the main 1951 Exhibitionon the South Bank, which is estimated at  6 million.    this sum will cover expenditure on site work, the construction and equipment of buildings, exhibition displays, operatingand maintenance costs and all other services.The other principal items in the estimate are 450,000 for the Science Exhibition at south Kensington, 380,000 for the Exhibition of Heavy Engineering at theKelvin Hall, Glasgow,  240,000 for the :;Live;t ArchitectureExhibition at Poplar, and  850,000 for the two Travelling-Exhibitions which will be visiting fourteen centres in theUnited Kingdom.    The remainder of the expenditure will be inrespect of various supplementary services necessary to thesuccess of these exhibitions,  and also, of course,  the salaries and overheads of the Festival Headquarters.The Government will make loans to Festival Gardens Ltd.,which will construct and operate the Pleasure Gardens inBattersea Park.   As the House is aware? the total outlay hasbeen estimated at  770,000, and the Festival Office andthe London County Council will advance the suras required inthe ratio of 60 : 40, with a limit to the loan by the LondonCounty Council of  200,000.    The total of  11.3 million,however,  only includes a figure of  60,000 in respect of the festival Gardens, which is an estimate of the loss theGovernment might have to bear.

These die tails are, I think, sufficient to givethe House a clear picture of the distribution ofexpenditure between the various Festival projects.    the festival Office have already made public some account oftheir plans, and I understand that they are now issuing a fairly detailed account of the scope, character and content of the South Bank Exhibition.    This will be followed in due course by detailed announcements about other parts of theprogramme as they mature.
