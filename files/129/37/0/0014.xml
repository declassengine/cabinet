THIS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1949 t        22Copy No.CABINETRECOGNITION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST government memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Communist Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China, which was set up on 1st October, 1949, has expressed a desire to enter into diplomatic relations with foreign Powers. The Soviet Union and satellite Powers havealready accorded de jure recognition. We shall have to make up our minds in&apos;due course whether or not to recognise the Communist Government as the de jureGovernment of China, but before we do so we are committed to consultation withother Commonwealth countries, with the United States and with other friendlyPowers. Since our interests in China are very much greater than those of theother Powers, we should not necessarily feel bound by the views of other Powers,but it is obviously desirable to obtain the largest measure of agreement possible and in particular the agreement of other Commonwealth countries.2. The question of recognition is to some extent bound up with the complaint to the United Nations Assembly of the Nationalist Government of China. this item is on the agenda of the Political Committee, and the attitude of the powers in that Committee will necessarily have some bearing on their attitude towards theCommunist Government. I set out in the following paragraphs the considerations which I think should govern our own attitude towards these two related questions.I.1 RecognitionArgument3. The Nationalist Government were our former allies in the war and sincethe war they have been a useful friend in the United Nations. To-day, however,they are no longer representative of anything but their ruling clique and their control over the remaining metropolitan territories after the fall of Canton istenuous. British interests can reap no advantage from continued recognition ofthis shadowy Government, since they lie almost entirely within Communist control.In the United Nations Organisation the continued recognition of the nationalist government offers the temporary advantage of a vote which in the past has usuallybeen cast in our favour, whereas a Communist vote is likely to be cast against us.But this is hardly an advantage which can be maintained indefinitely.4. For the time being the Communist Government of the People&apos;republic of China is the only alternative. The Communists are now the rulers of most of China. The fall of Canton has brought them to the Hong Kong frontier.It would be a mistake to disregard the fact that they are, on their own statements,orthodox Marxist-Leninists who openly declare their strong partiality for theSoviet Union and its methods. How long they will last, how &quot; orthodox &quot; theirmethods will be and how strong their leadership will prove is yet to be seen. Theyhave trade to offer and we have an immovable stake in their territory which canonly be maintained by trade. Too long delay in according them recognitioncannot fail to make them ill-disposed towards us. We may thereby gratuitouslyvitiate our future relations. Similarly, delay will increase the existing tendency37744SECRETCP. (39) 21414tth October, 1949
of the Communist Government to look to the SovietMm&amp;jx, and may induce thefeeling that they can tighten their belts and do without Western economic assistance. A considerable number of Russian technicians have already arrived in North China and it may be expected that the Soviet Union will take full advantage of the fact that they are first in the field. It is possible that in due course friction may develop between the Russians and the Chinese, but we cannottake advantage of this unless we are in relations with the Communist Government.5. As regards our own trading interests, we have advocated the policy of keeping a foot in the door. If this policy is to bear fruit (and British firms areremitting sterling from London to the tune of  360,000 a month for maintenance)it can only be done by according full and early recognition. On political as wellas practical grounds we should therefore decide to recognise the new regime.6. I am advised by the Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office that the recog-nition of the Chinese Communist Government as the de jure Government of China in the present circumstances cannot be said to be contrary to the principles and practice of international law, having regard to the proportion of Chinese territorycontrolled by the Communist Government, the firmness of its control there on theone hand and the small proportion of Chinese territory held by the Nationalistsand the tenuous nature of Nationalist control, where it exists, on the other hand.The hest writer on recognition in international law says; &quot; Sp Jong as.the revolu-tipn has not heen fully successful, and sp long as the lawful Gwerhment, howeveradversely affected by the fortunes cf the civil war, remains within national terri-tpry and asserts its authority, it as presumed to represent the State as a whole ....So long as the lawful Government offers resistance which is not ostensibly hopelessor purely nominal, thede jure recognition pf the Revolutionary Party as a Govern-ment constitutes premature recognition which the lawful Government is entitledto regard as an ,act of intervention contrary to international law.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;7. I consider that it can be asserted that the resistance pf the nationalist government in China is now ostensibly hopeless, and its control over any portionof Chinese territory on the mainland hardly more than nominal, and on thispolitical appreciation of the facts of the situation my Legal Adviser considersde jure recognition of the Communist Government to be legally justifiable.$. Our present positipn in regard to recognition is that His Majesty&apos;sConsul-General in Peking has made a cpmrounication in the following terms tothe Chinese Communist Government&quot; His Majjesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are carefullystudying the situation resulting from the formation of the Central PeopledGovernment. Friendly and mutually advantageous relations, both commer-cial and political, have existed between Britain and China for many genera-tions. It is hoped that these will continue in the future. His Majesty^Government in the United Kingdom therefore suggest that pending comple-tion of their study of the situation, informal relations should be established between His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers and the appropriate authorities inthe territory under the control of the Central Peoples Government for thegreater convenience of both Governments and promotion of trade betweenthe two countries.&quot;I am advised that this message can be interpreted as according recognition tothe Communist Government as the de facto Government of the territories whichthey control, but no reply has been received from the Communist Government andour original assumption that the Communists would be satisfied with nothing lessthan de jure recognition appears to be correct. In.my speech to the United nations assembly on 26th September I stated that China had entered into certain inter-national obligations which we feel must be honoured, and that a wise approach to the handling of these problems will be in the interest of the whole world. Iherehas been no further public indication of our attitude towards the question orrecognition.A attitude of other Powers9.   India  and Australia have made communications  to  the  V^nes?Communist Government similar in nature to that quoted above, and Portugaand Denmark have instructed their representatives to do the same.
10. It is clear from the talks which I had in Washington with Mr. Achesonand M, Schuman that the United States are not in favour of early de jure recogni-tion ,iand that France, because of her position in Indo-China, is afraid of theconsequences of such recognition, The attitude of the State Department isinfluenced by the attacks in Congress upon its China policy. In an effort to meet these attacks the State. Department published on 30th July a voluminous White,Paper pn China which, however, failed to stifle the critics and indeed providedthem with further ammunition. In the circumstances it must be recognised thatthe State Department will be influenced in its attitude more by internal Americanpolitics jthan by the realities of the situation in China. The French are influenced by the views of their High Commissioner in Indo-China, who appears to believethat de jure recognition of the Communist Government will endanger theconstitutional structure which has recently been set up under the Emperor BaoDai. This view is not shared by the French Ambassador in China, but it is never-theless likely to influence the French Government in the direction of deferringde jure recognition.11. Of the other foreign Powers with whom we have been in consultation,the Dutch may conceivably hesitate t,o recognise the Chinese Communist Govern-ment in view of the Indonesian situation, though this is not certain. The other european Powers may be expected to follow our lead..12. Of the other Commonwealth Powers, Canada may be reluctant to takea line unpalatable to the United States. Her interests in China are not extensive,and she may feel that in the circumstances hphe can afford to be out of step with the rest of the Commonwealth. Australia and India are believed to be infavour of early recognition. The other members of the Commonwealth have no direct representation in China, but will probably keep in line with the UnitedKingdom.13. It will be necessary to consult both with other Commonwealth countries and other friendly foreign Powers before reaching a decision to recognise theChinese Communist Government. Other Commonwealth Governments might beinvited to instruct their High Commissioners in London to confer with me, thusaffording evidence of the principle of Commonwealth consultation.II. Chinese Nationalist Motion in United Nations Assembly14. There is the related question of the Nationalist Governmenfs complaint to the United Nations Assembly. They have secured time in the First Committeeto invite attention to the infringements by the Soviet Union of the terms andspirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship of 1945. The question may come up for debate about mid-November. It is extremely doubtful if the Chinese can make a case against the U.S.S.R., and the move can only have for object a vainand belated attempt to make political capital. We have told the Chinese that wewould consider supporting their case if they can make one. The United StatesGovernment were initially rather more forthcoming, but have since realised the weakness of their position. Their White Paper on China has unfortunatelyprovided abundant material to show the extent of American intervention inChina and the rottenness and corruption which have led to the defeat of theNationalist Government and to the assumption of power by the Communists.The State Department now realise that the Soviet Union is likely to take full advantage of the opportunity thus provided, and it may be expected that therewill be a violent attack upon the status of the Nationalist Government and itsclaim to represent China in the United Nations Organisation.15. If we hold the views outlined in Section I of this paper and in conse-quence propose eventually to recognise the Communist Government, it follows that we should no longer support in any degree this Chinese resolution. Anythingwe say, however anodyne, can hardly&quot; fail to be embarrassing vis-a-vis the new regime, while our support of the Nationalist Government could not fail to makeus ridiculous in the face of the available evidence. Our best course would thereforeseem to be to instruct the United Kingdom representative to take no part whateverin the debate and to abstain from voting. We should explain our intentions andour reasons to Commonwealth Governments and other friendly Powers in advance.
III. Timing of Recognition16. It is clear from the preceding paragraphs that we cannot take a decision as to the date when de jure recognition should be accorded to the chinese communist Government until we have consulted with other Powers. We havealso to consider the impact of recognition upon United Kingdom interests inthe Far East. There is to be a conference at Singapore from 2nd-4th Novemberunder the chairmanship of Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, which will be attended byall His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Far East, including His Majesty&apos;ambassador to China, and also by the three Far Eastern Commanders-in-Chief.This will afford a suitable opportunity to discuss the implications of recognition,and it is desirable therefore to await the outcome of this conference before reaching a decision.Recommendations17.   I invite my colleagues to agree that (1) I should consult with the United States and other friendly Powers on thebasis of this paper;(2) our views be communicated to other Commonwealth Governments and thatthey be invited to instruct their High Commissioners in London toconfer with me on the,?question of recognition:.(3) no decision as to the date of recognition be taken until the results of these consultations are known and until a report is received on the outcome of the Singapore conference.E.
