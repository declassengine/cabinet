ujf (u* jU-\THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)setting-:Q R B TC. P. (49) 231 COPY NO.   If11TH NOVEMBER,  1949CABINETTHE BAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTS scheme memorandum by the Minister of FoodWhen I circulated the final Annual Report of the overseas Food Corporation (C P. (49) 210) I undertook to submitray proposals for the future development of the East AfricanGroundnuts Scheme.-     The programme for the next four yearsprepared by the Overseas Food Corporation has been examined indetail by my officials and, although commercial considerationsalone do not provide justification for its acceptance, theyhave recommended that it should be adopted, having regard tothe wider implications mentioned in this memorandum,      I have discussed the plan with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and secretary of State for the Colonies and they are agreed thatthe&apos; plan should be adopted.      I therefore seek the authorityof my colleagues for the following proposals for the further development of the East African Groundnuts Scheme.Reasons for the present proposals. It became apparent at the beginning of 1949 thatoriginal estimates (both those made in Mr. Frank Samuel&apos;original Scheme, and in the report of the Wakefield/Rosa/MartinMission) of the cost of clearing the African bush were sofaulty that there was no prospect of attaining the originalWhite Paper (Cmd, 7030) estimates of cleared acres within thelimits of the financial resources for which the corporation had Parliamentary authority.     The Corporation^ firstproposals (made in the light of their knowledge of actualclearing costs) envisaged a borrowing of some  67 million to clear 1,200,000 acres.      But since their borrowing power is limited under the Overseas Resources Development Act to  50million (plus  5 million which may be borrowed on short term)the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I felt unable to accept their programme and they were asked to put forward revised proposals v/hich kept expenditure, within the limits of theirborrowing powers.The present proposals3, The proposals which I have received from the Over-seas Food Corporation are set out in the annex to thismemorandum.      It represents what they consider to be the most economical use of the resources available to them for contin-uing their development work.      Briefly, what they propose isthat they should be authorised to proceed with development inthe period up to 1954 on the basis that by the end of thattime they will have achieved the&apos;clearing of 600,000 acres ata total estimated borrowing of about  47.6 million.      after allowing for the  2 million already required for the promising-Queensland Sorghum Scheme this will virtually commit.thepresent financial resources of the Corporation.4. The Corporation propose to make the most economic useof the resources which they have available to them. This willenable them to have cleared, by the end of 1953, 90,000 acres

at Kongwa, 90,000 acres at Urambo and 420,000 acres in theSouthern Province.      By the end of 1950 there will be cleared -90,000 acres at Kongwa, 90s00O acres at Urambo and 22,000acres in the Southern Province.      In other words, clearinghas already been completed at Kongwa and will be completed intwelve months&apos; time at Urambo.     Prom then onwards the wholeclearing effort of the Corporation will be concentrated inthe Southern Province which the agricultural experts believe to be much the most promising of the three areas.5. The Corporation^ programme shows a sharp reductionin the rate at which they will require to borrow money.Their borrowing in the current year (ending 31st March, 1950)is estimated at  10,650,000 compared with  13,350,000 in1948-49, and  8,000,000 in 1947-48.     Their further require-ments are;- 1950-51 4,500,0.001951-52 4,000,0001952-53 3,300,0001953-54 800,000In addition a further  3,000,000 are earmarked forreserves to cover the risk of losses on agricultural operations on the newly cleared lands during the development years of thescheme to 1954.     The greater part of the expenditure from1950 onwards v/ill be for wages and local materials.     the corporations programme therefore fulfils a further condition which the Chancellor invited me urgently.to request them toprovide for;    it provides, that is to say, for a very rapidfall in the rate of investment,of money.      This rate of investment falls from  14 million a year in the first quarterof this year to  4*5 million during 1950/51.     Indeed, it isonly possible to come down next year to less than one-thirdof the peak annual investment of last year because the maincapital works are at length almost completed.Is the Corporation*s plan feasible?6. Technical Problems.      I asked my officials toexamine, in so far as they were able, the technical bases ofthe new plan.      They report that there seems no reason why thedevelopment programme submitted by the Coloration shouldnot be achieved within the time allowed.      It is true that theprogramme calls for a rapid increase in the annual extent of clearing in the Southern Province where there has so far beenleast experience, and one naturally remembers the contrastbetween expectation and experience in the clearing of Kongwa.But there are substantial grounds for believing that thesedisappointments will not be repeated.      There is available the accumulated wealth of experience at Kongwa, and at Urambo(where vegetation conditions are very similar to those in theSouthern Province and where clearing has been proceeding forthe last six months at the estimated speed and cost):    therehas been a natural increase of efficiency in the organisationand deployment of tractor operations:;    there have beenexhaustive surveys of the initial 20,000 acres to be clearedand there is to be selective and not block clearing:communications in the shape of the railway (which is nowrunning on the essential 90 mile stretch between the temporaryport and the area being cleared)- pipe-line, etc.  have been built up in advance and the water supplies seem assured.      Ofcourse,&quot;there are still risks as there must inevitably be withany large-scale enterprise of this kind in tropical Africa.Unexpected difficulties may arise, but what is clear is that inputting forward their proposals the Corporation have been atpains fully to examine the doubtful and difficult factors andto frame their plans on realistic assumptions.

7. The capital requirements of the new plant      Myofficials are also satisfied that the programme should be capable of fulfilment v/ithin the Corporation^ borrowing powers, even if it is assumed that in some instances theCorporation have been optimistic in their cost estimates.      Itis, of course, impossible to make absolutely reliableestimates of all the unknowns.      The Corporation estimate that their&apos; plan can be carried, through by total borrowings of h7,600,000 of -which  3,000,000 are earmarked as a reserve tocover the risk of loss on actual agricultural operations duringthe development period.      My officials have checked over thiscalculation and,after making some adjustments which they feelreasonable but which it is not clear would be wholly acceptable to the Corporation;, they conclude that the total borrowingsrequired to complete the plan will be  h8,h30,000.      Bothestimates agree therefore that the plan can be.carried throughwithin the limit of the resources which have already beenapproved.      And my colleagues will welcome the assurance thatthese new estimates are based on actual experience in EastAfrica to a far greater extent than has been possible hitherto.The original calculations were made without the benefit of any practical experience in the actual operations.      The Corpora-tion, in framing thar new programme, have had the benefit of allthe hard won and costly experience of the past three years,8. The earning power of the new Scheme.      What sort ofasset will the Corporation have in East Africa when their development programme is completed?     By the end of 1953 therewill be 600,000 acres -cleared, and 540,000 acres will be undercrop in 195k&apos;      It is a formidable task to make any reasonableestimate, of what the earning power of 540,000 acres will be four years hence.      The major uncertainty results from two mainvariables - the actual yield per acre of oilseeds, and the.price of oilseeds in the years ahead.      In their case theCorporation have produced thdr own estimate and another indepen-dent estimate has been produced by ray officials.The Corporation&apos;s Estimate9.      (a)   The Development Period.      In making their estimateson agricultural operations during the development period(1950-54) the Corporation have assumed yields of 750 lbs. per acre of both groundnuts and sunflower.      They have alsoassumed the current price of oilseeds of  55 per ton for ground-nuts and  35 per ton for sunflower seed.      If they had accepted a &quot;safe&quot; estimate of yields (580 lbs. per acre) and if theestimate of oilseed prices prepared by my Ministry (falling to  1+0 per ton for groundnuts in 1953-54) had also been used,there would be a loss on agricultural operations over thefour years of  4,500,000.      Against this the Corporation haveearmarked  3,000,000 in the belief that both pessimisticassumptions will not be fully realised simultaneously, and because they are determined to secure that the deficiency on agricultural operations in this period does not exceed this figure.(b)   The First Post Development Year.      The Corporation^estimate for 1954-55 shows an operating profit for that year(after allowing for depreciation but not for interest oramortisation of capital) of  1,097,000.      In reaching this figure they have again assumed yields of 750 lbs. per acre, ofboth groundnuts and sunflower.      They have also again assumed the current price of oilseeds of  55 per ton for groundnutsand  35 per ton for sunflower seed.      The Corporation have recognised that this profit could easily be turned into a lossif lower yields and if lower prices were assumed.      But because there is hardly a limit to the assumptions which can be made forthe purpose of these hypothetical calculations the Corporationretain the present prices at the yields which the expertsbelieve will be attained, given experience.

The Ministry of Food&apos;s Estimate10. My officials have made a calculation of what theearning power of the scheme might be in a typical post-development year - not the year 1954-55.      On this assumptionand allowing for yields of 750 lbs.  an acre and their estimateof price of  ho per ton for groundnuts and o 27 per ton forsunflower, they estimate that there will be a deficit of 775*000 per year before charging any interests and withoutamort i sat i on.The vital assumptions of yields and price11.    (a)   Yields,     The experts still maintain that averageyields of 750 lbs- per acre of both groundnuts and sunflowercan be attained.     While they have suggested that it ?/ould be prudent not to rely on yields of more than 580 lbs.  in thedevelopment period the agricultural general manager in EastAfrica has assured me that he has not yet found any ground for believing that the 750 lbs, per acre cannot be achieved when thescheme is fully developed and the men are experienced.      Ofcourse, like all other farmers they have to accept the hazardsof the weather, but in making the estimate of 750 lbs,  due regard has been paid to this factor.     While as laymen we mayapproach the experts&apos; figure with caution, I cannot see anyvalid reason on which we can challenge their opinion.(b)    Prices.      Forward estimates of commodity prices arealways precarious and while I recognise that my own expertsare as capable as anyone in making an estimate I cannot fail to stress the margin of error to which these estimates are subject.     When I submitted my original proposal for thisscheme my experts advised that the price of groundnuts would&quot;not fall below  20 per ton&quot; this year.      At the moment wehave contracted to pay  53 per ton - a price even higher thanthat at which we were buying groundnuts in 1947.      I use thatillustration to show the danger of clinging too closely to ahypothetical balance sheet without regard to the uncertainty of the main assumption..     On the Corporation^ very favourableestimate of price the scheme will earn a margin of  1,000,000a year;    on the Ministry&apos;s more pessimistic estimate the scheme will lose  775,000 a year.      There is so much uncertainty about these assumptions that no real decisive conclusions, inrny opinion, can be drawn from the financial estimates.     Thescheme might make a surplus, or a loss, mainly according tothe prices reached for the product.Is the new scheme &quot;economic&quot;?12. One thing that is certain, however, is that theearning power of a 600,000 acre scheme will not be able tocarry the overhead costs which were thought appropriate for1,200,000 acre scheme (as was proposed a year-ago) or 3,000,000acre scheme (as originally suggested).      Both the above calcu-lations have been made on the assumption that no allowance isprovided for interest or amortisation of capital.      Indeed thevarious calculations show that it cannot even be certain,because of variable factors of price and yield, that the600,000 acre scheme will actually earn a surplus on current account.      Therefore on purely financial grounds the scheme isnot at all attractive.     &quot; 32,000,000 has already been spent,and a further  16,000,000 is needed over the next four years to produce an asset which cannot even be guaranteed to coverits own operating costs.      My officials feel that, in view ofthe uncertainties about price, on purely financial grounds itwould not be possible to i^ecommend the acceptance of theCorporation^ plan, but they feel that the future of the scheme must be determined by references to wider considerations.

\that* are the alternative policies?13. The Corporation set out in paragraph 9 of their memorandum their considered view that there are only two alternative courses of action - either to adopt the plan whichthey have proposed or to abandon the whole scheme forthwith.But is no middle course possible?     At first sight such a middle course appears to have much to commend it.      Its adop-tion would avoid either of the drastic alternatives postulatedby the Corporation - the termination of the scheme, with allthat this would involve or a further large scale programmeinvolving the borrowing of another  15-17 million at a diffi-cult juncture in our financial history.     Would it not bebetter to clear in the next two years some &quot;minimum&quot; economicacreage in the Southern Province (say 30,000 to 50,000 acres)and then - unless both the general financial position in theUnited Kingdom and the prospect of the scheme itself werebrighter than now - for the Corporation to settle down forsome time to operatettelr total holdings of say 300,000 acres in the most economic manner possible?     This would give theCorporation an opportunity of testing and deciding what wouldbe the most effective longer-term use of the cleared land andit would be in the light of their knowledge that, at a later date, the Government and the Corporation would be able todetermine whether the time was ripe for further development work to be undertaken in the Southern Province.      Such aview might commend a good deal of support at the present time,when we are being obliged to restrict capital investment.My officials have considered this possibility but have putforward what seem to mo very cogent reasons for rejecting it.14. Firstly the Corporation have greatly improved theefficiency of their organisation in East Africa.      They havealready built up the ancillary services such as communications and workshops which will be needed for going on with compar-atively large scale development work.      They have available a &quot;striking force&quot; of experienced staff and equipment whichis capable of carrying through a clearing effort - which thoughsmall in comparison with the original plan will yet employ all their existing resources.      It would obviously be wasteful to under-employ this force in what would be no more than a relatively small scale clearing operation.      Moreover, adecision to curtail development work would almost certainlyresult in breaking the force up.      It would be the signal tothe able men in East Africa to seek a new job elsewhere.They would feel that the scheme had seen its death sentence.And once the team of experienced men was dissipated it wouldbe almost impossible to build it up again.15. And the resulting asset would have far less chanceof successful and economic operation than a total area of600,000 acres.      It would burden the scheme with even greateroverheads because the capital expenditure required per clearedacre would be even more disproportionate if spread over only300,000 acres.      Much the larger proportion of capital outlayin the Corporation^ programme occurs during the next two years at the end of which, the cleared acreage is expected to havereached 300,000 acres, and, although this expenditure is gearedto a programme of 600,000 acres,  it is very probable indeedthat a disproportionate amount, in addition to the sums alreadyspent on preparation, would be involved in undertaking a smallerprogramme.16. Furthermore,  a reduced programme would not give thescheme a satisfactory trial.      It would of necessity limitdevelopment in the Southern Province.      180,000 acres would be cleared in Kongwa and Urambo and therefore there would only bethe balance to be cleared, in the Southern Province which is themost promising area of the three. .   Any chance of the schemeproving its viability would be severely prejudiced, if not lost.

What would&quot;closing down&quot;mean?17* What v/ould be involved in a decision to &quot;close down&quot;the scheme- immediately?     If this were done on financial groundsit would require the immediate cancellation of all contracts for the supply of equipment, the dismissal of all the staffin East Africa save those who would be required for the dis-posal of all equipment and the immediate cessation of all workthere,.      It is most unlikely that more than a small proportionof the cleared land could be used by the Government of tanganyika.      The assets in East Africa would consist of apartly constructed port and nearly completed railway in theSouthern Province (the purpose for v/hich would have vanished),several considerable settlements ranging from the new town ofKongwa (which is already the second largest town In Tanganyika) and various scattered housing developments through-out the territory.      These towns and townships have each con-siderable public works in the way of water supply, drainage,electric light and the like - none of them, in the absence ofthe groundnut scheme itself, would serve any visible purpose;many hundreds of miles of new roads - some, no doubt, ofthese would be of some use to the community, but in the absenceof the groundnut scheme they would also be, to a large extent,wrongly sited:    some 100,000 acres of cleared area at Kongwain the Central Province, in -what is proving the least promisingbecause the least well watered area of the three, 20^000&quot;cleared acres at Urambo in the Western Province and some,000 cleared acres in the Southern Province.      It is very doubtful whether these cleared acres on these sites would in themselves represent a workable proposition from the agri-cultural point of view.     There can be no reason for questioningthe Corporation^ views that if the scheme is abandoned nowthere will be a loss of  30 million.     And abandonment of thegroundnut scheme will mean the end of the Overseas PoodCorporation at a time when there is every sign that they are really taking a grip of the scheme.      Mistakes have been made   &apos;but the great majority of our difficulties result from theearly years of the scheme before experience had been built up and when all were working to unattainable targets.     TheCorporation took over effective control of the scheme on31st March, 194-8, and I have been encouraged by the way inwhich they have overcome many of the problems which theyinherited.Can His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to a closing down policy?18. Is this course of closing dov/n the scheme a policy to which the Government can subscribe?     We embarked on thisjob with due realisation of the risks which we had to run.In my paper recommending the adoption of the scheme (CP. (4/; 10dated 4th January, 1947) I said:    &quot;My colleagues will see thatthis is a big enterprise;    it has to be if it is to meet evena substantial, part of. our desperate need for fats.      Mycolleagues would not believe me if I tried to pretend to themthat such a scheme was free from risk.      Of course,  serious difficulties and delays, many of them unforeseeable, may arise in the course of a great undertaking of this sort.&quot;      It was because the risks were so high that we selected a public cor-poration to tackle the enterprise.      An enterprise of this nature involves considerable risks and I think it would be disastrous for the prospects and prestige of public enterpriseif we were to abandon the East African Groundnuts Scheme because some of the risks in the opening years have gone against it.How many of the really large business concerns have been successful right from the outset?     Surely commercial experience shows that many of the really great businesses have only been built up after years of extraordinary difficulty - years with-out dividends, years when capital wi s written down - but yetsuccessful in the end.      Our policy necessarily implies that only public enterprise will be available to.take the really

big risks involved in opening up new frontiers in our colonial Empire.      It is vital, therefore, that v/e shouldpersevere with our efforts unless we are to discredit the very-principle of public enterprise, at any rate in this field.19. And, above all, how could we, after having spent 30 million, abandon the Scheme at this stage, before we have enough experience to judge whether it will prove a success ornot?     We have no grounds whatever for   saying that it will fail, any more than we can &quot;prove&quot; its ultimate success.     Wecannot use the costs during the first two years as a sound basis on which to estimate the final operating costs of theScheme.      Until we have allowed development to go on long enough for more reliable estimates of costs to be made, how canv/e make any real estimate of the final outcome?     Surely weshould lay ourselves open to every sort of criticism if wewere to give up now.     Not only should we be abandoning a project which had not had a chance of proving itself, but weshould be dealing a severe blow to enterprise throughout theCommonwealth.      For the groundnuts scheme has come to be looked upon as a prototype for this kind of large scale development.The world needs more food20. The Chief Scientific Officer of the Ministry ofAgriculture recently gave it as his opinion that because thepopulation of the v/orld is increasing at the rate of 20 million a year it will be-necessary to double the world&apos;s food produc-tion in the next 26 years.      If v/e are to plan for a satis-factory food supply for the housewives of this country, and forthe population of our Colonial territories, v/e must not try to ignore the effect which this increase in world population,coupled with a general acceptance of the fact that the pre-warstandard of nutrition is unacceptable, will have on the world food situation.      If we are to plan for plenty we must baseour plan on increased xjroduction.     This means that new-frontiers must be opened up.     The East African GroundnutScheme is a pioneering effort to use modern equipment to bringmarginal land into service for the jjroduction of food and ifnecessary other raw materials.      The real need for the increasedsupply of food is no.less urgent today than it was when thescheme was launched and to abandon it now would only make oureventual long term food problem more difficult.      If we can make this project succeed we will have provided a prototype for similar developments elsewhere throughout the world.      We willhave developed and demonstrated a new clearing and productiontechnique for tropical countries.The effects of abandonment on our Colonial Territories21. The Groundnut Scheme has become an important symbolin our Colonial Empire.      It is a bold experiment to raise theeconomic productivity of the African territories by replacing the primitive hoe by modern mechanical agricultural machines.The output per head of the agricultural worker can be liftedsubstantially and so provides an economic base for the develop-ment of a higher standard of life.      The work provides openingsfor skilled and semi-skilled labour.      One of the morespectacular successes of the scheme has been the way in whichit has been possible to recruit and train local labour for manyskilled jobs.      Men have trekked from all over TanganyikaTerritory to secure jobs.      The possibilities for the Africansare considerable.      If we abandon all this and break up thescheme, the Africans not only in Tanganyika but throughout thewhole of East Africa will suffer a great disappointment and itwill be an other blow for British prestige.

22. The effect in the United^States.   Some americans have watched tho development of this scheme with closeinterest.   It represents firstly a convincing proof of our determination to develop sterling sources of food supply.Secondly it is a real demonstration of our belief in&quot; thedevelopment of our backward, territories.   We are hoping to take full advantage of any opportunities which may arise for UnitedStates capital investment in the British Colonies.    It would greatly discourage United States help in this field if weabandoned the one really large scale food production projectwhich we have started since the end of the war.   Kow could we expect United States investors to take the kind of risks which we admit to be too great?23. I feel that it is on these wider grounds of policy that our decision must be based.      Our detailed estimates of probable income and expenditure are essential - but not the decisive - evidence.      It is not possible to demonstrate thata 600,000 acre scheme will be able to cover its costs - butat the same time it is not possible to prove that it would lose money.      The outcome depends on factors which we cannotestimate with any degree of precision.      I would be the first to admit that for as far as we can see at the moment we cannotjustify the scheme as a purely commercial venture in the precise sense that, allowing for the risks,  it is likeljr toprovide a rate of profit in the accepted business sense ofthat term.      The original estimates of costs contained in theWakefield/Rosa report were too far out for this.      But I thinkthat there is every jusification for going ahead with thescheme on the sharply reduced basis now proposed when the wider aspects have been taken into account.24. In making this recommendation that the scheme should go forward on the lines proposed by the Corporation I would ask my colleagues to bear in mind the very great differences between these proposals and those which we had when we firstconsidered the project.      The present proposals are based on three years&apos; practical work in the bush under tropical con-ditions in East Africa.      They are put forward by men whohave now had years of experience on the job.      The plans are based on lessons which have been learnt and in the sureknowledge that the administrative base to support the enterprise has been safely established.      The communications,the workshops, the spare parts and all the other administrativefacilities which did not exist in 1947 have now been provided.Experienced men now have the tools with which to finish the job.      And the Overseas Pood Corporation, although it onlytook over responsibility eighteen months ago, has alreadyshown itself capable of more sustained leadership and effectiveorganisation in East Africa than the Managing Agency.25. I believe, however, that it is essential to strengthen the Board of the Corporation.      For obvious reasons I do not want to go into details in this paper, but I will indicateorally to my colleagues the changes which I have in mind andwhich I have discussed with the Chancellor.      I am confident that the result of these changes will be to secure a Board,which will ensure not only that the approved programme iscarried out with vigour but that the maximum economies in organisation are achieved.26. In particular the strengthened Board will have to payspecial attention to the pressing problem of improving the accouting arrangements of the Corporation.      It is, of course,very unsatisfactory that the Auditors should have had to qualify the 191+8-194-9 accounts.      Undoubtedly there wereextenuating circumstances of considerable significance:    thebulk purchase of surplus stores, difficulties of accommodation,an acute shortage of experienced staff.      But some part of the

failure has been clue to an inadequate appreciation of theproblem on the part of the Managing Agency and of theCorporation itself at the early stages.      The Board is already taking emergency measures to deal with the back-log of accounts, and.to strengthen its staff and overhaul itsaccounting organisation in East Africa.      I have formallydrawn their attention to the urgent importance of doing- every-thing possible to avoid a position in which the 19h9-50accounts are also subject to qualification by the Auditors,27. On the agricultural side I am making arrangements to broaden the advisory field on which the Corporation draws.This will ensure that all the technical matters, such asrotation and selection of crops, are fully explored in thelight of experience elsewhere, and that the experimental work is such as to yield results which can be used as a reliableguide for future plans.      In particular I am arranging for regular consultation between the Corporation &apos;s experts and theColonial Secretary&apos;s agricultural advisers whose experiencewill, I believe, contribute materially to the development ofthe Scheme on the right lines.Summary of the problem28. It may be helpful if, in conclusion, I endeavour toset out the essence of the problem as I see it.(i)    By the end of this financial year, the corporation will have cleared and planted 112,000 acres and the clearingof a further 90,000 acres will be in train.      The borrowingsby the Corporation in the same period will have amounted to approximately  32 million.      The Corporation propose that theyshould be authorised to proceed with further development plansover the ensuing four year period designed to bring the totalcleared area up to 600,000 acres.      They estimate that such a programme would involve a total borrowing of the order of if?&apos; 6 million.(ii)    The Corporation state that in their view thealternative to this programme is to close the scheme down,involving an estimated loss of . 30 million.(iii)    My Department has examined the Corporation^proposals and, broadly speaking, are satisfied with the physical and financial assumptions underlying the capital development programme.      But they have re-assessed theCorporation^ estimate of earnings in a typical post-develop-ment year in the light of what they considered to be more realistic assumptions of price and total crop.      On this basis the surplus envisaged by the Corporation would become a deficit.(iv)    They have also examined the possibility of a policyof limited liability - e.g.  a four year development programmeinvolving a total cleared area of 300,000 acres.      But their conclusion is that although this would involve a modest saving of capital (say of the order of  5 million including the totalcost of clearing the 300,000 acres cut from the target) the resultant net revenue would be more than halved owing to the impossibility of bringing down the operating overheadsproportionately.      In addition to this there would be a seriouswaste of the new railway and port installations built in theSouthern Province.      Under the Corporation&apos;s proposals these

would handle the produce of 4-20,000 acres,- whereas under a300,000 acre scheme the acreage in that Province will helimited to 120,000 acres - i. e.  there would he a reductionof 72 per cent in payable freight.(v)   The conclusion is that - quite apart from theeffect of a smaller scheme 011 the morale of the Corporationsstaff in East Africa - a limited objective would involve an uneconomic use of resources and increase the financial difficulties of the scheme.RECOMMENDATION *29. I therefore recommend that the Overseas PoodCorporation should be authorised to proceed with theirrevised programme to clear 600,000 acres of bush in EastAfrica for agricultural production by November, 1953*J.

STRICTLY   OCKFIIJENlI/iLThe .first Annual Report and Accounts of the \ overseas food Career at ion. now being available, the Corporation have made are-assessment &quot;of ihe Scheme in the: light of iho financial results ofthe first two years, the scale of expenditure, now being incurred underthe I94.9/50 budget and the operational experience to date the natureof this re-assessment,&apos; although still tentative in many&apos; respe cts,inevitably calls into que stion the whole basis of the Scheme.2. .      &quot;Operations in East Africa. Commenced at; the beginning of&apos;1947, oh the plan set out in Cmd.7030.   When therGorpbrati ori;assumed-OxecTutiye direotion on the 1st April, ,1948, decisions had-.been &quot;taken(including the location of the three main production centres and thenew port and railway) and action was completed or in hand (includingth?.purchase . of ^equipment and the engagement of personnel) which hadalready .fixed the pattern of future development in accordance with the/original&apos;&apos;plan.   V/hile it was obvious at once that this plan could hot &apos;&apos;be implemented as it stood, the Corporation accepted at - the outset the-view expressed-by the Managing Agency, in -their report&apos; on the first&apos;yearnsperformance, to the effect that it should be. possible to develop the vh;bieplan within the broad framework of Cmd.7030 i:and to achieve-the resultsanticipated by the end of the six year, period;   Roasons&quot;to doubt thisyieiv soon arose3*, one/;.of,.th2 first tasks of the Corporation was. to prcduoea detailed plan of development, and later to cost it. -/This plan&apos;,-asfinally presented in&quot;December, 1948, was designed -to&apos; produce on a revisedagricuitural-rptation&apos; the quantity of oil aimed-:at under the original scheme but frbrn,&apos;the&apos;clearance of 2,355,000 acres &apos;to 31st &quot;March, 1958, asagainst  3,210,.000 Vacres to 3,1st March, 1953* .Thc capital expendituretotalled  95 millions, with a maximum cash drawing of; &amp;7 millions, thedifference representing estimated surplus earnings to 31st March, 1957V:An informal discussion of this plan with the. Chancellor of the Exchequer-/made, it clear that .there was. no.-prospect&apos; of;the Corporations borrowing powers ( 50 millions on long term and  5 millions on short term) being&apos;extended at this stage, and that a. programme must be produced within thepresent limits.  ,This has now been done with.results which show a furtherupward revision in capital cost and a downward revision in estimatedearnings.4?        &apos; The. position on the. capital side, is summarised in. Appendix :1to uhis memorandum.. In round sums, the- figures show that  32 millions will,have been expended in the period to the: 31st ;March, 1950, wHen 100,000 acresmil be available for agriculture, and-that a further  13 millions expendedin the period 1st April,. 1950, to 31st March, 1954, are estimated to produce an. additional 500,000 acres, making 600,000&apos;Acres in all for a total capitalexpenditure of., 45. cilli &quot;hay.- &apos;;ii statement -showing the contrast between thesefigures and. those of Gmd. 7030 is at Appendix 11.&apos;5.   .. ..... The difficulties which have confronted the scheme to the 3lst March1949, are fully set out in the., Annual, Report and heed/hot,be^repeated. Therewere,., amongst other things, serious defects in management over that period buit will/be apparent from the figures in Appendices 1 and 11 that the problems involved go far beyond, 4ue.st.i0ns -of. managment- Or organizatloh. -   Nothing that/the ManagingM.274-9/25/9.WDB&apos;memorandum oneast; aerican .GR0UNDNUT scheme
the Managing Agents^ ,vkhe Corporation or the Contractors could have done, otherthan to suspend or drastiballjr&quot;curtail operations, would have produced a situation radically different from that -which faces us to-day;   in particular,little more knowledge as to the economic  irospects of agricultural production could have been&apos; provided than we now possess.     The plain fact is that therewere fundamental miscalculations in the Scheme as originally approved,     The-capital expenditure necessitated by the present plan in the four/years, fromthe 1st april 1950, -which is,broadly estimated to produce 500,000 acres fora further  13 millions ;of capital, is at a rate of four times that estimated in the original Scheme after allowance for such improvements in ^operatingtechnique and such economies in administrative costs as are regarded as;capable of realization vd thin, that period,     The figures maybe capable ofimprovement in the future, but it:would be unsafe to anticipate further reductions now.    Grave as the capital figures are, the balance of advantage would obviously lie, given that at least  30 millions have already been committed resulting in an. asset, of about 100,00.0 acres, in gsing to  45ndllidnsuto secure 600,000 acres, provided, of course, that&apos;there is-areasonable prospect of cultivating the additional 500,000 acres on ah;&apos;Veconomic basis.     This,prospect depends on so many factors at present unknownthat it is a matter on which,the Corporation can give no firm assurance atthis1 stage *     ; /..&apos; &quot;&quot; &apos;.:&apos;6. The year 1948/49 - waip the first in which agriculture was carriedout on - any- scale,, and it coincided with a severe dr ught.     In. any &quot;case, itwas not on a large enough scale for reliable conclusions to he drawn about future operations.-.   - in 1949/50 three full units will be cultivated at kongwa and this will apply the first test of any value to the operation oflarge scale agriculture.    At Appendix 111 vdll.be fcund estimates of thecost of operations for the four years from trio 1st *April, 1950, :and at appendix IV an estimate, with important qualifications, of income and &apos;expenditure thereafter for the twenty units which should be cleared by thatdate. . On the expenditure side these are the best estimates -which theCorporation can make, but it is.reasonable to ,suppose that they will be improved upon in time.     The Scheme cannot carry a European staff on. &quot;thepresent scale or on that provided for over the four year period.    during that period the Corporation will be.carrying out a comprehensive, and. in theboth Buropcran: and  African, lacks -experience.     Significant oocnomies  -ohoula result as intimate farming knowledge grows and improvements in agricultural equipment and technique will undoubtedly be made in the lightof experience and the experimental results of the Operational Research Unit.But there is at this stage no reliable data on which a further-re-assessment of&apos;costs is. possible.     Some allowance for improvement has already been made.Jllowance has also been made for the economies in adrinistrative costs nowbeing carried out, but there should be scope for further reduction -when thedevelopment stage is over.1 * On&apos;; &quot;the. income, side the East African Management has assumed in preparing the , figures of the plan a yield of 750 lbs. per acre of bclhgroundnuts and \ sunflowers with c.&amp; f. prices of  55 and&apos;  35 a ton respectively,that is those now current...   In regard to yields, it is essential for the-future of the Scheme that, these estimates should be realized on the average,and certainly in the case..of siinflowers, improved upon.   . The estimates allow 44,000 a year for fertiliser in the operating costs of each 30,000 acres, -which averages 30% of such cost.     It is obvious that the use of artificialfertiliser would be unjustified on yields below/those estimated, but for a variety of reasons it is doubtful -whether &apos;this output can be reached in &quot;thefirst few years.    It is. obviously prudent also to allow for a fall incurrent prices.     J. revision of the estimates which, reduce the yields tothe average over,the four year period considered to be&apos; a 3afe one by theHast African iana.cement and the prices to&apos;-those forecast by the Linistryof Pool would leave a cash deficiency in -the ostimtes as presented of 44- millions.     The fact is that there are factors affecting both incorce/and expehditire
and expenditure which, are outside accurate estimation, and in anycase the Corporation would not &quot;be prepared, to recommend facing a       -deficiency of this order over the four year period.   They&apos;recommend,therefore, that  3 millions only be reserved on&apos;the understanding that&apos;&apos;agricultural operations must bo conducted oh a cash&apos;doficicncy not.exceeding this, figure within the period, which must &quot;be regarded as a development one.&apos;&apos;     .&apos;&apos;.&quot;-8. ...   The income; from the operation of twenty units (Appendix IV)is similarly estimated..&apos; . It will be seen that &quot;after allowing for depreciation a margin of  1 million is forecast, but it must be made clearthat on a prudent estimate of prices this would be converted into a deficitprovided that, when the time comes, the estimated yields and the ratio ofgroundnuts-to sunflowers cannot be*Increased and the estimated expenditurereduced. . The fact is that there is no data at present available for these areas which allows reliable conclusions to be drawn, but nor is there as yet firm ground, for the assumption that agricultural production cannot, intime, be conducted at a profit,9* The alternatives now open, In the Corporation^ view, areas follows :- &apos;.&apos; &apos;(A) To close down at once.   Allowing for the re-assumption of liability for the port and railways (now assumed by theEast African Railways), notice and leave pay to staff, theeffect of a mass sale of plant and stores, the negligiblevalue for any other purpose of most of the buildings and/installations which would become redundant, compensationfor cancelled contracts arid so f orth, it is unlikely that .total net expenditure would be loss&apos; than  30 millions.   Itmight, be more.    The area then available to the Corporation  - &apos;for agricultural production would be 112,000 acres, mostly . ;    &apos;in.the less promising Kbngwa region.   It could make no appreciable contribution to charges on a-debt of this order.Something like  30 millions would therefore bo a dead loss.(B) To proceed on the linos of the latest East African plan(with such modifications and provisos as may bo decided upon);a plan which estimates a capital expenditure of  32 -millions to 31st March, 1950. (of which at least  30 millions isalready committed) with a further  13 millions over the fouryears to 31st March, 1954; bringing the area cleared for agriculture from 112,000 acres as at 31st March, 1950, to600,000 acres as at 31st March, 1954, and requires, inaddition, a reserve of  3 millions to cover the&apos; risk of -losses in agricultural production over the four year period;that is a total estimated liability of  48 millions.10. In considering the recommendation that they are to make,the Corporation must have regard to the obligations, /imposed upon them bySection 15 (1) of the Overseas. Resources Development Act, which requiresthem to secure that their revenues arc not less than sufficient to meet all sums properly chargeable to&apos; the revenue account taking one year with another.    It will be plain from tho preceding paragraphs that theCorporation are in no position at the present time to put forward longrange estimates which show this result or to predict when, if ever, sucha result can be attained.    Experience has demonstrated that whenagricultural industries are put to a test which threatens their survivalvery drastic economies can bo made, and on the face of it there seems a margin in the present-estimates for such economies over and above thosewhich are incorporated in them,   Vfloile on broad.grounds therefore, theCorporation sees no reason to suppose that given time the agriculturaloperations on 600,000 acres cannot be conducted at a profit, they canhold out little hope that this profit will ever carry debt and redemptioncharges on the full capital, which at that stage will approach  50 millions./ 11. Provided that
/Provided that the implications of the foregoingqualification-are accepted, the Corporation would propose proceeding :,with the present plan, on the following grounds &apos;:**:&apos;,-.Tho plan is actively in hand and it includes&apos; for the first.        -time- large-, scale clearing and large scale cultivation.    It \ -also includes for the first time conditions which give the operators a fair chance.   It is true that they have not all&apos;&quot; the knowledge and experimental results or all the specialised .equipment which would be desirable, but they have more than before..- If the attempt, is not - continued now it may never be known conclusively whether this means of development in Africa ;is economically feasible or not.   Pilot schemes will nevergive, the full answer.   Each succeeding year will show; results,operational, agricultural and financial, from which far clearerlessons can be drawn than are possible to-day, and the fruitswill be seen of the administrative reorganization andretrenchment now&apos;in hand.   The expenditure of, say, another 16 millions to quintuple the productive asset and to applythese vital tests must be considered in relation to the sumalready risked and, on any other alternative, lost.   progress will, of course, be held under constant review and if at anytime abandonment seems&apos;the lesser evil it is not excluded.It is tho urgent need, - in tho wider interest of&apos;the Commonwealth,to secure some new means of developing Africa and its people and of opening up new areas of food production - with all thatflows directly and&apos; indirectly from such development .-. which,justifies, in. the Corporations view, the recommendation that,having gone so far, the further risk be taken.12.   - -       The detailed amplification of the figures in -the Appendicesto this memorandum will be found in the First Report and Accounts of theCorporation and in the Development - Plan prepared by the East AfricanManagement.. &quot; &apos;   . .       -LONDON28th September, 194-9
