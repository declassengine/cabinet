Copy No. 31CABINETPRIVATE CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN FOREIGN countries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Foreign Secretary and I have for some time had proposals before theEconomic Policy Committee (E.P.C. (49) 95, 98 (Revise) and 100) for a Bill, tobe introduced this Session, to cover three connected subjects :-(a) The appropriation of certain Russian and Baltic assets, and their division(in whole or in part) among British claimants against Russia and theBaltic States by a special Commission to be set up under the Bill.(b) The division by the same Commission among the various claimants ofcompensation for nationalised property to be paid by czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.(c) The use of pre-war German assets in this country to pay a dividend onpre-war claims by United Kingdom residents on Germany.The first two subjects are mainly the Foreign Secretary&apos;s concern, the last onemainly mine.2. More pressing business has so far prevented the Committee from con-sidering our papers. Meanwhile the Legislation Committee have provisionallyearmarked space in this Session&apos;s programme only for &quot;a Bill on the distributionof assets nationalised abroad (H.P.C. (49) 22nd Meeting, Minute 1): the rest,subject to further consideration, stands over to the 1950 programme. All these points are of real importance, but not all of them can be dealt with during thepresent Parliament. I would like before it is too late to look at them afresh andpick out what is really urgent from what can stand over.3. I understand that the Foreign Secretary thinks it most undesirable to dealwith the Yugoslav compensation in one Bill and the Russian assets in another.In addition, the Bill covering Yugoslavia could not be ready in time for this session, because there are questions to be agreed with other commonwealth countries (Canada and others) before the Bill can be produced. The foreign secretary will therefore not be asking at all for legislation on either subject duringthis Session, but will ask that it should be agreed (a) that a Bill on both subjects should be introduced during next Session; and(&amp;) that he can announce this Session that a Bill covering the division ofYugoslav compensation will be introduced next Session (nothing need be said now about the Russian and Baltic claims).4. There remains the problem of the German claims and assets. This is dealt with at length in my paper E.P.C. (49) 95, but can be summarised as follows.There are pre-war German assets of about  15 million in the hands of the Cus-todian of Enemy Property. Under our inter-Allied agreements, they are oursas reparation; we can do what we like with them. They could be paid into theExchequer; but there are strong arguments for making them available to thepre-war creditors of Germany (there are contractual claims of between  100 and37739SECRETCP.

 120 million). This is the precedent of the Treaty of Versailles and of the peace treaties with the satellite States after this war. We owe special consideration tomany of the debtors : nearly all arise from pre-1933 contracts and a large partarise from obligations entered into because of the direct encouragement of theGovernment of the day.5. I favour making these assets available to the pre-war creditors. The costto the Exchequer will be less than the sums paid out, since much will come backas tax. I should propose to lay down only the broad lines of the scheme in theBill; the details would, be filled in by Order in Council after consultation between a representative Advisory Committee and the Administrator appointed by theBoard of Trade, with whom the final responsibility would lie. -The cost of theoperation should be met from the assets.6. The matter is now of considerable urgency and I still hope that it can betaken this Session. The question was first raised in the House in January last;I have been pressed for a statement; and on 18th October, in answer to a question,I promised one soon. I shall be embarrassed if I have to temporise any further on this matter, which has been outstanding for so long, and I am anxious to get it settled during the life of the present Parliament. If I cannot take this oppor-tunity I shall have to give up all chance of carrying it through, unless I am tooverburden the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Bill, which is quite long enough for a sessionof uncertain length. I am therefore asking the Legislation Committee to agreethat a place should be reserved in this Session&apos;s programme for a Bill on theGerman assets and claims alone.7. Subject to this proving possible and to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s agreeing to be responsible for a separate Bill to dispose of the Yugoslav and Czechoslovakcompensation and the Russian and Baltic assets, I ask (a) that my proposals for the disposal of the pre-war German assets, as setout in paragraphs 4-6 above, should be approved; and(b) that I should be authorised to introduce a Bill as soon as possible in this session to cover this subject alone.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st October, 1949.
