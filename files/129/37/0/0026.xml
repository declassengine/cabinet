Copy No-cabinetTITLE AND STATUS OF COMMONWEALTH HIGHCOMMISSIONERSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal at the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers held in October 1948rthere was considerable discussion as to the title and status of High Commissionersexchanged between Commonwealth countries. The majority view was against the title &quot; High Commissioner,&quot; but agreement could not be reached on an alternativetitle. South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon favoured the adoption of the title&quot;Ambassador.&quot; Canada and Australia were prepared to agree to this: NewZealand, India and the United Kingdom opposed it. The United Kingdom Dele-gation, supported strongly by New Zealand, used the following arguments : (a) that this title carried with it by tradition and practice the implication.that its holder was the representative of a foreign State;(b) that the relation of Commonwealth Governments to one another is quite different in character from the relationship of foreign countries, andthat this difference should be emphasised by the use of a different titlefor their representatives from that used by foreign countries;(c) that the treatment accorded to Commonwealth High Commissioners andtheir staffs is essentially different from that accorded to foreign repre-sentatives, and if the same title were accorded to both, the represen-tatives of foreign countries might claim the same treatment as those of commonwealth countries.As agreement could not be reached on the question of title, the matter was left over for discussion at a further meeting. The Meeting agreed to make certain changes in the status of High Commissioners, particularly as regards pre-cedence, in order to indicate clearly that they hold equivalent status to that heldby Ambassadors.2. Recently there have been developments which make it necessary to recoh-sider the question of the title and position of High Commissioners. These are as.follows : (1) The United Kingdom High Commisssioner in India has reported that ithas been indicated to him informally by the Government of India thatwhen India becomes a Republic (on 26th January, 1950) the Govern-ment of India are likely to suggest that their representatives in other commonwealth countries should be given the title of &quot; Ambassador &quot;and receive full diplomatic immunities such as are accorded to therepresentatives of foreign states. In another connection the Govern-ment of India have formally represented in strong terms their dissatis-faction with the existing position under which representatives of commonwealth countries do not receive the diplomatic immunityaccorded to the representatives of foreign states.   Sir Archibald Nye37817&apos; &apos; b &apos;;&apos;: .SECRETCP. (49) 2263rd November, 1949THIS * DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S &apos; GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1949
has expressed a strong view that he should be put in the position toaccept the proposed change of title as soon as it is intimated to him in a formal manner, and his advice is that we should &quot;go more than half-way to meet India and not risk appearing to give grudgingacquiescence as the result of pressure.&quot;(2) The Government of the Irish Republic have announced that Mr. KrishnaMenon, who has been appointed Indian Ambassador to the Republic(and who is the first Ambassador to be accredited to the Irish Republic),will be accorded precedence over the United Kingdom representative and other representatives of Commonwealth countries, to whom theyaccord only the status of Minister. In response to representations,the Irish Republican Government have indicated that they have alwaysconsidered that our representative should be styled &quot; Ambassador,&quot;and that it would be most difficult for the question of precedence to be resolved in any other way. The High Commissioner for the republic of Ireland in London enjoys the same precedence as foreign Ambas-sadors and other High Commissioners. The withdrawal of thisprecedence is the only sanction open to us against the present attitudeof the Irish Republican Government. It would, however, be difficulton personal grounds to deal with Mr. Dulanty (who is next to theDoyen of the Diplomatic Corps in seniority) in this way, and if we did so it would be open to the Irish Republic to withdraw him andinsist on appointing an Ambassador or Minister. It is necessary thatthis situation should be resolved in the fairly near future. Thequestion of precedence has not arisen in a practical form hithertobecause Mr. Krishna Menon is not resident in Dublin and has not beenthere since his appointment. It is, however, likely to arise in apractical form before the end of the year. The difficulties may alsobe enhanced if the United States, as is possible, appoint an ambassador to Dublin.3. The principal argument against the use of the title &quot; Ambassador &quot; bythe representative of one Commonwealth country in another is that advanced atthe 1948 Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, namely, that it denotes a foreign relationship.For this reason we insisted on the use of the title &apos;&apos; Representative &apos;&apos; for our representative in the Irish Republic in order to strengthen our case for maintaining that our new relationship with the Irish Republic was not a foreignrelationship. A minor technical argument against accepting the title&quot; Ambassador &quot; for the representatives exchanged between commonwealth countries has been that the King cannot accredit an Ambassador to himself. this argument does not apply in the case of the Irish Republic and will not apply inthe case of India when it becomes a republic. It would probably not be insuperableif it were thought desirable to adopt the title &quot; Ambassador &quot; for all representa-tives of Commonwealth countries. The crucial question is whether the adoptionof the title Ambassador will so weaken the Commonwealth relationship byappearing to assimilate it more closely to a foreign relationship that it ought tobe resisted.4. The Board of Trade feel strongly that the use of the title &quot; HighCommissioner &quot; is an important visible symbol of the non-foreign status which commonwealth countries enjoy in relation to one another. They therefore feelthat such a change of title in respect of India and the Irish Republic would greatlyweaken our ability to defend the continuance of tariff preferences. While thisis of less practical importance to United Kingdom trade in regard to the irish republic than in regard to India, the Board of Trade consider that an attemptought to be made to dissuade both Governments, and particularly the indian government, from pressing for the exchange of Ambassadors. To prevent sucha change in the case of India is, in their view, specially important because a challenge in respect of preference in the Indian market is a serious risk a,ndbecause India&apos;s example is likely to be followed by other Commonwealth countries.A general change made by all Commonwealth countries would weaken the claimto non-foreign status in respect of the Commonwealth in general. The Board ofTrade have therefore suggested that this matter might be discussed between thePrime Minister and Pandit Nehru when he is in London on the basis that fulldiplomatic immunity and the same status as an Ambassador in all.other respectswould be granted to the Indian High Commissioner.    The Commonwealth
Relations Office are, however, advised by the United Kingdom High commissioner in India that in his view it would be hopeless and also harmful to our relationswith the Government of India to endeavour to persuade them to forgo the title of Ambassador; that this would still be so if it were explained to them thatdiplomatic immunity would be granted; and that to make such a request would only be to court a rebuff.5. It appears to me exceedingly difficult to resist the Indian, claim. Wecould, of course; reason with the Government of India and see whether we canpersuade them to accept the title &quot; High Commissioner.&quot; Sir Archibald Nye,however, clearly regards any such attempt as hopeless. If my colleagues agreewith the further proposals which I make later in this paper as regards the grantof diplomatic immunity to Commonwealth representatives, we could accompanythis attempt with an assurance that immunity will be granted, but I think thatthe prospect of such an attempt succeeding is so small that it is not worthpursuing. In my view we should, as Sir Archibald Nye advises, acquiesce in theIndian proposals without demur. If this is accepted, I see little reason for maintaining our attitude in the case of the Irish Republic. To accept theexchange of Ambassadors would get us out of a troublesome difficulty about theprecedence of our Representative. We can hardly accept a position under whichhe and other Commonwealth representatives are given an inferior status merely because they are not styled &quot; Ambassador,&quot; and we may well find that we shouldnot have the support of Other Commonwealth countries, particularly Australia, in refusing to accept the title Ambassador. The argument that to concede this titlewould weaken our case for asserting that our relationship with the Irish Republicis not a foreign relationship is no longer so forcible, since in fact no challenge tothis proposition has been raised by any other country.6. If these arguments are accepted, the question arises whether we should propose to other Commonwealth Governments that the title &quot; Ambassador shouldbe adopted for all representatives exchanged between Commonwealth countries.Against this course there are the following arguments: (a) The general argument for preserving a distinguishing title for Common-wealth representatives which differentiates them from foreign repre-sentatives, reinforced by the general argument in relation to tariffpreference advanced by the Board of Trade (see paragraph 4 above).(b) We should be leaving the New Zealand Government, who are the strong-est supporters of Commonwealth integrity, in a minority of one ona matter in which they have strongly supported us in maintaining a valuable distinguishing mark of the Commonwealth relationship.(c) It would be practicable to draw a distinction in this matter between Indiaand other Commonwealth countries, since India alone will not oweallegiance to the Crown.On the other hand we know from the 1948 discussions that the Governments ofAustralia, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon desire to adopt the title &apos;&apos; Ambas-ambassador,&quot; and from more recent indications that Canada would raise no objectionto doing so. We shall have to consult other Commonwealth countries before we agree to the adoption of this title in the case of India. This may lead some ofthem, e.g., South Africa, to press strongly for the same treatment. Thus we maybe driven to adopt the title Ambassador for most Commonwealth representativesif not all. The Foreign Office consider that it would be preferable to make thechange universally rather than piecemeal.7. I recommend to my colleagues that we should approach all commonwealth governments on this subject as in the draft telegram in Annex A and leave themto express their views. If, as well may be, the majority are in favour of uniformadoption of the title &quot; Ambassador,&quot; we should have to press the New zealand government to agree to this course, but could do so on the basis that this isthe majority view. If not, I hope that we could hold the position that it isonly in the case of representatives exchanged between India and other Common-weaolth countries that the title &quot;Ambassador&quot; is used.8. If it is agreed to accept the title &quot; Ambassador &quot;in the Irish Republic,is is desirable to make the change without waiting until the same change is madefor India.   The Canadian Government are known to be disposed to accede to a-   37817 &apos; -   - -      - B 2:., ...
request which is being formed by the Irish Republic for the exchange of ambassadors, and once it become known that we propose to make this changecertain foreign countries which are now considering appointing Ambassadors may do so at once in order to secure precedence.9. There remains the question of the grant of diplomatic immunity to therepresentatives of Commonwealth countries. High Commissioners and seniormembers of their staffs already receive the various privileges in respect of freedom from customs duties, taxation and so on which are accorded to foreign diplomatic representatives. They do not, however, receive the immunity from suit which isaccorded to representatives of foreign powers. This point has become an issuewith the Government of India over the case of Mr. Thivy, their representative in Malaya, who has been sued for libel in respect of actions committed in a privatecapacity before he was appointed as India&apos;s representative. The Government ofIndia have, as a result, made strong representations to our High commissioner to the effect that they regard it as a matter of national prestige that theirrepresentatives in other Commonwealth countries should have the same diplomaticimmunity as they would have in a non-Commonwealth country. Our HighCommissioner in India has urged in this connection that it is most desirablethat he and his staff should have diplomatic immunity since, if at any timerelations between this country and India should become strained, our representa-tives there might be severely harassed by legal proceedings taken against themin Indian Courts.  The same considerations apply in Pakistan.10. On the Prime Ministers instructions the case of Mr. Thivy was referredto the Law Officers for advice. The Law Officers have advised that, althoughimmunity would not in any event have been available to Mr. Thivy in the circum-stanees of his case, serious consideration should be given to the question whetherrepresentatives of Commonwealth countries ought not to be accorded similarimmunities to those extended to foreign representatives, and that, while thisquestion must in the last resort be decided by considerations of policy in their view the legal position would quite possibly justify an affirmative conclusion.The relevant parts of the Law Officers&apos; opinion whicK deal with the legal position on this subject are set out in Annex B. The Law Officers indicate that in fact the question whether Commonwealth representatives are entitled to immunityhas never been tested in the courts, and that, if it were, the courts might decide that these representatives are already entitled to such immunity. If they decidedotherwise, legislation would be necessary. It will no doubt be agreed that if we decide that immunity should be granted&apos;, this should be done by legislation with-out waiting for the matter to be tested in the courts.11. The question of granting immunity has been considered by officials, whohave reached the conclusion that there is no administrative reason why this shouldnot be granted and that, for the reasons given by the Law Officers, it is desirablethat it should be done. It would, of course, be on a basis of reciprocity. It is contemplated that the High Commissioner and his staff at the capital of thecountry would be treated for the purpose of immunity (irrespective of the decision taken about his title) on the same footing as an Ambassador. commonwealth representatives at places other than the capital or independent territories (e.g.,the United Kingdom Deputy High Commissioners in Calcutta and Bombay andthe Indian and Australian representatives in Malaya) would be treated on thesame footing as Consuls.The first step is to consult commonwealth Governments as to the general pro-posal. Subsequently, it will be necessary to consult with them in greater detailas to precisely which members of the staffs of their High Commissioners and ourown should be granted immunity, and as to the detailed working of the arrange-ment. In general the proposal is to follow as closely as possible the Foreign Officepractice, and to make the actual immunity dependent upon a certificate by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations that a particular individual is received in a certain capacity.12. I recommend to my colleagues that this proposal should be approved inprinciple, that Commonwealth Governments should be approached in regard to itsimultaneously but independently of the communication to them about the title of High Commissioners, and that it should be made clear that immunity shouldbe granted irrespective of the decision taken on the question of the title.

Title of commonwealth representatives at Dublin.1. In connection with grant of precedence over other Commonwealth repre-sentatives to newly appointed Indian Ambassador, United Kingdom representa-tive to Republic of Ireland has been informed by Minister of External affairs that Government of Irish Republic consider title of High Commissioner orRepresentative to be anomalous in present circumstances, that they would preferall representatives from Commonwealth countries at Dublin to be styledAmbassador, and that they would find it most difficult now to go to the diplomatic corps (with whom they had had difficulty in arranging for treatment of Common-wealth Representatives as if they were foreign ministers) with proposal to give them same precedence as Ambassadors if they did not have that title.2. United Kingdom Representative warned Minister that, if it was notpossible to grant United Kingdom Representative in Dublin the appropriateAmbassadorial precedence, it would probably be exceedingly difficult to justifyits continuation to the Irish High Commissioner in London. He promised,however, to report the Ministers views.3. United Kingdom High Commissioner in India has reported, and thishas been confirmed by a conversation between United Kingdom High Com-missioner in Canada and his Indian colleague, that Government of India arelikely to suggest that when India becomes a Republic title of representativesexchanged between India and other Commonwealth countries should be changed to Ambassador.4. Agreement could not be reached at Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in 1948 on change of title of High Commissioners, and Mr. Attleesummarised the position at the end of that meeting as follows : &quot; As agreement37817 B 3outcome of this consultation is satisfactory, the Commonwealth Relations Office-should be authorised to promote legislation for this purpose early in the New Year.It is not part of my proposals that any changes agreed upon should apply to southern Rhodesia, which does not control its own external relations. Theposition would be explained to the Southern Rhodesian Government at a later-stage.13.   To sum up, I recommend i(a) that we should decide in principle to exchange Ambassadors with Indiaand the Irish Republic, in the case of India from the date on whichIndia becomes a Republic;(&amp;) that Commonwealth Governments other than India should be consulted as in Annex A forthwith, and that the decision whether to adopt thestyle &quot;Ambassador&quot; generally instead of &quot; High Commissioner&quot;should await the outcome of this consultation;(c) that the Commonwealth Relations Office should be authorised to consultCommonwealth Governments on the proposal to grant diplomatic and consular immunity on a reciprocal basis and subsequently to introduce legislation to grant such immunity to the representatives of all Com-commonwealth countries which are prepared to grant comparable immunityto our own representatives.USSMZ-A ZMfM M      : - $MM        -a. ^ -2nd November, 1949.
had not been reached it seemed best to leave the matter over for another meeting.The United Kingdom Government were not opposed to the idea of finding analternative title : but that of &apos; Ambassador&apos; carried with it by tradition and practice the implication that its holder was the representative of a foreign State.&quot;The meeting agreed that representatives of Commonwealth countries to Common-wealth countries ought not to be accredited, as Ambassadors are, by Letters ofCredence signed by The King. It is therefore necessary that Governments ofother Commonwealth countries should be consulted before any change is agreedto in respect of Irish Republic or India.5. Position of both Eire and India has changed since 1948. Former is are public outside the Commonwealth, and India will be a Republic within theCommonwealth. United Kingdom Government had attached importance to there being no change of title of Commonwealth representatives in Irish Republic inorder to strengthen the hands of both Governments should foreign Governmentsclaim that their relationship is now such that no more preferential treatment islegitimate than that given to most favoured nations. The appointment of an indian Ambassador to Ireland has weakened this argument, no claims have in fact been made by foreign Governments, and the Minister of External Affairs informed the United Kingdom Representative that he did not attach importance to it. india will cease in January to owe allegiance to The King, and Indian Ambassadors will presumably be accredited by the President of the Indian Republic. There would therefore be no technical difficulty about exchange of Ambassadors between Indiaand other Commonwealth countries. &apos;6. Government of India have in another connection made strong formalrepresentations that full diplomatic immunities should be accorded to all indian representatives in other Commonwealth countries. I am addressing you separatelyon this subject. It is not considered, however, that this is the main motive behindIndian Governmenfs request for change of title or that they would be satisfied with grant of immunities only.7. The United Kingdom Government consider that the Government ofIndia&apos;s desire to exchange Ambassadors with other Commonwealth countries willhave to be acceded to. Differentiation in the case of India could be justified onthe basis that India has ceased to owe allegiance to the Crown, a consideration which does not apply in the other countries of the Commonwealth, though thereare obvious objections to cessation of a uniform practice as between countries of theCommonwealth. As regards the Irish Republic, the Government would be disposed to accede to their request. Before taking action, however, United KingdomGovernment wish to receive views of other Commonwealth Governments.8. Differentiation would be avoided if title of representatives of other commonwealth Governments to whichever Commonwealth country they may beaccredited were also changed to &quot;Ambassador.&quot; This course would, however,be open to objections which Mr. Attlee and other United Kingdom Ministersexpressed at the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in October 1948. The United KingdomGovernment still consider that these objections have substantial force and would,therefore, prefer to adhere to the title High Commissioner except in the caseof India. They consider, however, that it is essential to preserve uniformity of practice between Commonwealth countries which owe allegiance. Moreover,differentiation may make it more difficult to maintain that India is entitled, asa member of the Commonwealth, to give to and receive from other commonwealth countries the same preferences as those countries give to each other.9. It should be noted and if necessary made clear that any alteration whichmay be adopted in regard to titles of representatives of Commonwealth countriesor the representative of the Irish Republic would make no alteration in theexisting responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationsor the Commonwealth Relations Office.10. United Kingdom High Commissioners in Ottawa, Canberra, Welling-ton, Pretoria, Karachi and Colombo are asked to bring above to immediate noticeof Commonwealth Government concerned, with a view to securing expression oftheir views with as little delay as possible. This telegram is addressed to UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Delhi and United Kingdom Representative atDublin for information only at this stage.
ANNEX BReport of the Law Officers of the Crown, We are asked to advise whether a Mr. Thivy, stated to be the representativeof the Government of India in Malaya, enjoys there any immunity from suit.The question seems to us to raise, in an immediate form, the whole problem of thestatus of representatives of the Commonwealth countries. This is a matter of constitutional and political importance and as, on the view we take, the course to be chosen depends on policy, we think the matter should be referred to theCabinet before the Attorney-General of Malaya submits the views of HisMajesty&apos;s- Government to the Malayan Court. This necessitates some effortbeing made to postpone the further hearing of the matter in Malaya.(1) The nature of the immunities to which a State representative is entitledin another State is based on international law and the comity of Nations although in practice it depends on the extent to which the rules of international law areembodied and applied by the municipal law of the country in which the immunityis claimed. We do not advise upon the law now current in Malaya, but thegeneral position is that a diplomatic Envoy such as an Ambassador has whilstholding his office a complete immunity from suit both civil and criminal whetheror not the subject matter of the suit arose either before or after he was appointedor related to his official office, the immunity probably continuing in relation toprior official acts after his appointment has come to an end. In the case of consular representatives the immunity relates to his official acts only. In thepractice of the English Courts it is for His Majesty to certify in what capacity and character the Agent comes to this country.Musman v. Engelke (1928) A.C. p. 433. It is for the Courts to decide thenature of the immunity then attaching to him in that character. Hitherto theCourts have only considered these immunities in relation to Agents of foreign states, the locus classieus as to their entitlement to immunity being MagdalenaSteam Navigation Co. v. Martin 1859 2 E &amp; E 94. Since the rule itself was based on international law which has only recently accepted the Common-wealth countries as being fully sovereign States entitled to the right of legationthe Courts have not had occasion to consider whether it applied to the repre-sentatives of countries within the Commonwealth and there are, indeed, instancesin the books where suit has been brought against such representatives withoutany questions of immunity being raised (e.g., Isaacs v. Cook 1925 2 K.B. 391).Moreover, the text writers have hitherto taken the view that the ordinary diplo-matic immunities do not attach to the representatives of Commonwealth countries(c/. Oppenheim Vol. I International Law 7th Ed. p. 692).(2) It seems to us, however, that the precedents of the last century, and indeed those prior to the Statute of Westminster have little relation to the facts of the existing relationship between the Commonwealth countries and might at the least be given a broad interpretation by the Courts if the matter came before them. It is, therefore, now for serious consideration whether the repre-sentatives of Commonwealth countries ought not to be accorded similar immunitiesto those extended to foreign representatives and, if so, how this result shouldbe brought about. The question must in the last resort be decided by considera-tions of policy but in our view the legal position would quite possibly justify an affirmative conclusion.(3) Whilst it is, of course, of importance that nothing should be done whichwould lend support to the view that the Commonwealth countries are foreign inrelation to each other, it cannot now be doubted that they are accepted by the law of nations as fully sovereign and independent States united with each other ina special association. This is particularly true of the present and anticipatedposition of India. Since 1919 the different Commonwealth countries have beenaccepted as possessing and have frequently exercised the right of legation, andalthough in Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s declaration of 1920 this was stated to be subject to&quot; the principle of the diplomatic unity of the British Empire &quot; this doctrine has,we think, long since passed away. But whilst Commonwealth countries are beyond doubt entitled to send and receive diplomatic Envoys to and from countries outsidethe Commonwealth it does not follow that the representatives they exchangebetween themselves are entitled- to that status.   The two manifest objections in
law to the recognition of the diplomatic status in such cases are that, except inthe case of * India, the recognition would involve His Majesty in accrediting orreceiving representatives to or from himself and that the diplomatic immunity,arising as it does from international law, can only exist between foreign states which, in their relations with each other, the Commonwealth countries are not.We are not impressed by the difficulty of the first point.   The so-called divisibilityof the Crown was demonstrated by certain of the Dominions in connection withthe abdication of King Edward VIII, and became the more real during the war when His Majesty was both at war and at peace.   Recent Ministerial discussions on the possible alteration of the Royal Title have confirmed the view that The Kingmust be regarded as acting in separate capacities as Monarch of his several nations.We do not think there is now any valid theoretical objection on this score.    the objection that diplomatic immunities have existed and can exist only betweenforeign States is more formidable and the argument against it, if carried too far,could prove embarrassing.   Without embarking upon any detailed examinationof the books it may perhaps be argued that ultimately the basis of diplomaticimmunity flows from the fact that independent sovereign States have no power or control over each other by law par in parem non habet imperium- and thatthe relations between them can, therefore, only be settled by negotiation, a functionwhich their representatives could only efficiently carry out if they received theprotection of jurisdictional immunity whilst in the territory of each other.   Thisreasoning would seem to embrace the present States of the commonwealth countries.   Whilst it is true that, as a matter of English theory, the imperial parliament could undo what it has done in the Statute of Westminster, 1931, andthe Indian Independence Act, 1947 (British Coal Corporation v. The King, J935,A.C. 500 p. 520), the conventional principles of the Commonwealth stated in theDeclaration of Conventional Equality of Status in 1926 and embodied in theStatute of Westminster leave no doubt that in practice the several countries ofthe Commonwealth although not regarding each other as foreign are independent and sovereign, par inter pares, and incapable of ordering their relations with eachother save by negotiation.   Such negotiations may occasionally be conductedthrough Prime Ministers or other responsible Ministers but are normally carriedout by the High Commissioners who are, as it seems to us, in effect diplomatic representatives.  It is true that they are not accredited and received in the sameAvay as Ambassadors, but this is a matter of procedure. They are, in fact, receivedby His Majesty&apos;s Government as the representatives of their States and for thepurpose of conducting relationships with those States.   We do not think that thefact that they are not to be regarded as foreign in relation to each other shouldprevent the Commonwealth countries possessing a right of legation in relationto each other, and indeed a somewhat stronger case existed before the first world war when the member states of the Federal State of Germany sent and receiveddiplomatic Envoys not only in intercourse with one another but also with outsideStates.   The truth is, we think, that whilst the Commonwealth is sui generis therepresentatives of the various Commonwealth countries do now perform inter sewhat is in principle essentially a diplomatic function to which immunities could we think ourselves should quite properly be attached, but which owing to pastpractice and the gradual evolution to the present position does not automaticallyattract that protection.   We shall refer later to the alternative courses of actionto which this view might lead.(4) There is, however, one respect in which we think that the position ofthe Commonwealth countries differs from that of foreign States. In the case ofthe latter, the English Court accepts a certificate from the Crown as to theirsovereign independent status as conclusive. (Duff v. Kelantan, 1924, A.C. 797.)This is not only because it is convenient that there should be no divergence between his Majesty&apos;s Courts and His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in such a matter but because etheir status does not depend on English law and is peculiarly within the knowledge and prerogative of the Crown in the conduct of foreign affairs. That status ofthe Commonwealth countries is, on the contrary, derived from Statutes of theUnited Kingdom Parliament and the Courts might perhaps go behind acertificate from the Secretary of State if one were to be given.(5) On the basis of the above view it is now necessary to consider the positionof Mr. Thivy. Full diplomatic Representatives, such as Ambassadors, ministers and Charge- d&apos;Affaires, are received only at the seat of the Government of the sovereign State to which they are accredited and, in the case of an Empire, atthe seat of the Metropolitan Government.  This is so of the Commonwealth High
Commissioners and it follows that Mr. Thivy cannot on any view be entitled to full diplomatic status. It remains true that he has been received in Malaya asthe representative of the State of India. We are not very fully informed as tohis precise functions, but they seem to correspond broadly and indeed to be larger than those discharged by Consuls. Whilst, therefore, the claim of theIndian Government to full diplomatic immunity in respect of him seems untenableit seems difficult to deny him such immunities as attach to Consuls, although,indeed, these would afford him insufficient protection in the circumstances of thepresent suit.(6) It remains to consider what should be done. There appear to be three courses open (i) To instruct the Attorney-General of Malaya to inform the Court thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government does not accept Mr. Thivy in Malaya inthe status of a High Commissioner in a diplomatic or consularcapacity. Simultaneously, a communication might be addressed tothe Government of India that the communication which the Attorney-General of Malaya made to the Court was in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the only communication that he could have been instructedto make in view of the hitherto existing practice that diplomaticimmunities have never been recognised as attaching to commonwealth representatives within the Commonwealth.(ii) To instruct the Attorney-General to inform the Court that Mr. Thivyis (following the actual language of the proposal of the Indian Govern-ment accepted in August 1947) accepted by His Majesty&apos;s government as the representative in Malaya of the Government of India chargedwith the duty of maintaining liaison with the Malayan Government inall matters affecting Indian interests and Indians of all classes (notmerely labour) and working for the promotion of better and moreharmonious relations between the two countries and constituting thenormal channel of communications between the Government of Indiaand the Government of Malaya.If this second course were adopted it would be for the Court to decide whether in view of the Attorney-General&apos;s statement any diplomatic or consular immunityattached to Mr. Thivy by virtue of his office, and the Attorney-General shouldalso be instructed to present arguments to the Court to enable the Court to cometo a conclusion as to whether any such privilege arose. The arguments should,of course, objectively present the considerations which could be suggested infavour and against the existence of any such privilege without formallycommitting himself or His Majesty&apos;s Government to any concluded view.(iii) To introduce legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament creatingimmunity in favour of Commonwealth representatives.We favour the first course, which we think is probably most in accord withthe existing state of the law on this topic. But since the Indian Government maywell resent this somewhat negative attitude, the note to the Government of india should also state (i) that even if High Commissioners should now be regarded as entitled to full diplomatic immunity, His Majesty&apos;s Government felt thatMr. Thivy would in any event not be entitled.to such immunity since his status was at the most broadly analagous to that of a Consul and high Commissioners were only received at the Metropolitan. seat ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and the result,therefore, would be that in the particular case in question he couldnot be given any effective immunity since consular immunity would notbe sufficient to protect him against the suit in question;(ii) that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom felt that the time had come to review the whole question of the diplomatic status of commonwealth representatives, it being hardly consistent with thereal relationship between Commonwealth countries that high commissioners-and possibly subordinate representatives should not be invested with extra territorial immunity, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom proposed accordingly to initiateconversation with the other Commonwealth countries with a view to agreement on a common policy on the nature and extent of theimmunities to be accorded to each country&apos;s representatives.
(7) We have suggested the above procedure since we feel that it is appro-priate in this particular case and also because we think that the whole matter should now be taken into consideration with a view to an accord between theCommonwealth countries for the reciprocal recognition of their respectiverepresentatives as entitled to the normal extra territorial immunity attaching tothe diplomatic and consular envoys of sovereign States. We advise, therefore,that the matters should be submitted to the Cabinet with a view to their deciding whether action should be taken on the lines suggested. If an affirmative decision is reached and a basis acceptable to all Commonwealth countries is eventuallyarrived at in the subsequent conversations, it will remain to be settled, in thelight of what is agreed, whether the matter should first be raised in a test actionbefore the Courts or by the introduction of legislation.(Signed) HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.FRANK SOSKICE.Law Officers&apos; Department,28th July, 1949.
