The necessity for legislation by the United Kingdomarises in the following manner.      The Canadian Constitution isembodied in the British North America Act, 1867, and varioussubsequent amending Acts.      While the Statute of Westminster,1931 9 gave Canada (like the other Dominions specified in theStatute) full power to amend United Kingdom Acts applying to canada, a provision (section 7) was included in the Statute,at the express request of Canada, to the effect that this wasnot to apply to the British North America Acts.      These can therefore only be amended by the United Kingdom Parliament.3. It has long been recognised, both in this country andin Canada, that a situation in which Canada has not the power,which all other Commonwealth countries of similar status nowpossess, of amending her Constitution without recourse to the parliament of another Commonwealth country,  is anomalous andembarrassing to both countries.      The difficulty in alteringthis procedure has been the impossibility of devising a pro-cedure for alteration of the Constitution of Canada itself,having regard to questions arising as to the relations betweenthe Federal Government and Parliament and those of the CanadianProvinces.The course which the Canadian Government have now is that the Constitution should be capable of amendmentthe Canadian Federal Parliament in relation to matters solelyh.proposedwithin the jurisdiction of that Parliament, and that thequestion of procedure for amendment of the Constitution inrelation to matters of joint Federal and Provincial concernshould be discussed at a Conference of representatives of theDominion and Provincial Governments which is to meet on the10th January.      The legislation for which the Canadian Parliamentare now asking would give effect to the first of these objects.5.
