(49) 225).R. S. C.-Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,.10** December, 1949.ECONOMIC REPORTImI. Man-power the total working population rose during October by 46,000 (15,000 males and31,000 females). The size of the Forces was reduced by 6,000, and the number ofmen and women on release leave who had not yet taken up employment fell by7,000 to 14,000 during the month. The number of registered unemployed rose by34,000. The net result of these changes was that the number in civil employmentincreased further by 25,000.2.   Employment in the manufacturing industries increased by 42,000 in HOctober. The number employed in metals, engineering and vehicles, which hadbeen falling steadily since January, rose in September by 7,000 and in Octoberby 11,000. Employment in textiles increased by 9,000-2,000 in cotton, 2,000 inwool and 5,000 in other textiles. I&apos;3.   The number of persons registered as unemployed in Great Britain rose Mfurther from 300,000 at 10th October to 323,600 at 14th November. The numberof males who- had been unemployed for more than 8 weeks rose between these twodates from 98,000 to 103,000. Unemployment, both of boys and of girls under 18,was lower than in October. BII. Production il4. The general level of industrial production, after allowing for seasonalfactors, continues to rise. The index of total industrial production (1946 ^ 100)rose in September to 132-8 points more than in September 1948. The index for manufacturing industries was 136 compared with 127 in September 1948.37948 b
5. The index for building and contracting rose to 133 in September-itshighest level since the war.Interim Index of Industrial Production(average 1946 = 100)	All industries			Manufacturing industries			1947-48	1948-49	Points increase	1947-48	1948-49	Points increaseDecember and January	117	123	6	117	125;	v    8   ,February    .........	123	130	7	124	133	9March and April......	121	128	7	123	.  131	.8.May and June      ......	120	132	12	123	136	13July and August   ...	111	&apos;   118	7	113	121	8September   .........	124	132	8	127	136	9Coal6. Output of deep-mined coal rose to a weekly average of 4-27 million tonsin November. This was 4 - 3 per cent, greater than output in the correspondingperiod of 1948. During the week ended 3rd December, output rose even further to 4-36 million tons. Although the number of wage-earners on colliery booksdeclined further from 710,000 at the end of October lx) 708,000 at 19th November,the number of&quot; workers at the coal face was maintained at 294,000-^-the same asat November 1948, but 5,000 less than in March of this year.j\ Number of wage-earners on colliery books(Thousands). ...        , Workers atTotal coal fdce1948- -November.........      ........  724 2941949-March       .........      ,..... 727 299November 19      ......   ...      ...      ... /      708 2947. The rate of absenteeism for&quot; all workers fell to 11-45 per cent, inNovember, i.e., to slightly less than the rate in November 1948, and Output perman-shift overall rose to 1-21 tons.8. Overseas shipments and bunkers rose to an average of 455,000 tons a week in October and in the first week of November exceeded 500,000 tons. this compares with a weekly average of 889,000 tons in 1938.Iron and Steel -----9. The output of steel ingots and castings in September and October wasabout 2 per cent, below the target of 312,000 tons a Week, but output increased inNovember and was equal to the target rate.10.   Stocks of pig iron and of scrap continue to rise.Textiles: ll. The output of wool textiles made a good recovery in September afterthe summer holidays. Production of worsted yarn was 17-4 million lb.^-2 percent, below the peak figure reached in March. Deliveries of woven wool fabricsreached 24 - 8 million linear yards in September compared with the previous record of 24 - 6 million linear yards in March.12. There was a sharp increase in output of rayon yarn to a new record levelof 27 million lb. in September. Output for the nine months to Septemberamounted to 208 million lb.   The target for the year is 300 million lb.13. Output of cotton yarn rose to 20-85 million lb. in the fourth week ofNovember-the highest level since the war. Total production for the first 47 weeks of 1949 was 4-3 per cent, greater than in the corresponding period of 1948. the target for 1949 requires an increase over actual production in 1948 of 9^ per cent.
Motor Vehicles *   -14. A hew record output of 9,420 passenger cars a week was achieve?! inOctober. Of these, 6,116 a week were produced for export compared with 5;209a week in September and the previous record of 5,344 a week in May. this increase in October was almost entirely in small cars of up to 1,600 c.c. Thenumber of large cars (over 2,200ic.c) for export, however, rose slightly to ;a&apos; newrecord of 846 a week.15. The value of our exports of all passenger cars (including chassis) rose from  6-88 million in September tc a new record of  7-82 million in October.Although the value of exports to Canada declined to  592,000, exports to theUnited States rose from the low level of  57,000 a month in the third quarterto  192,000 in October. This is still well below the rate of  634,000 a monthachieved in the last quarter of 1948.Exports of all passenger cars (including chassis)(Monthly averages or calendar months)  thousand	Total to all countries&quot;	To United States	To Canada1948 4th Quarter   ...      ...	5,233	.634	.4601949 1st Quarter   ...	5,334	205	3822nd Quarter   ...	5,677	78	6293rd Quarter   .v      ...	5,601	57	. 779 : \   ,October        ...     ...	7,824	192	&apos;   592   ...16. Production of commercial vehicles also increased from .an average of4,505 a week in September to a new record of 4,940 a week in October and thenumber produced for export increased further to 2,518 a week.III.-Building17. The number of new permanent houses (excluding aluminium houses)completed in Great Britain declined slightly in October to 16,372. For localauthorities 13,293 new houses were completed and construction was begun on13,322 houses during the month. New contracts for local authority houses, whichhad fallen from 17,832 in July to 12,634 in September, rose to 15,022 in October.IY. External Trade18. The value of British exports rose to  156 million in October the highest level since March. The volume of -these exports is provisionally estimated at158 per cent, of the 1938 average compared with 144 per cent, in September and156 per cent, in the first quarter of the year.19. The value of imports rose to  198-9 million in October. Althoughexports were greater both in value and in volume in October, the increase in thevalue of imports (mainly food imports) was largely the result of an increase inprices. Imports invoiced in foreign currencies have for the most part been enteredat values converted at the new exchange rates. These increases do not necessarilyrepresent increases in ther prices paid for goods imported in October since, for someof them, payment will have been made at the old exchange rates.20. Exports of metal goods rose to  79-4 million in October almost equalto the record level achieved in January. Although exports of textiles were slightlybetter than in September they were still lower in Value than in any other monthof this year. Exports of coal rose to 1-41 million tons (valued at  5 05 million)in October the highest figure since 1940.21. British exports to the Western Hemisphere rose from 14-3 per cent, ofthe value of total exports in September to 17-7 per cent, in October. Exportsto the United States increased to  5 - 6 million in October the highest figure since january.   Compared with September there were increases in exports of whisky,37948 b 2
raw wool, tin, woollen and worsted piece-goods, linen piece-goods and motor cars.Exports to Canada, which had been falling since July, also rose in October to 6-4 million. ,22.Y. Balance of payments the changes this year in our gold and dollar deficit are shown below.Net Gold and Dollar Deficit (*)(United States $ million)Weekly averages:-1949 1st Quarter	26April    ......	34May     ......	52June     .......	56July     ......	53August ...	45Weeks ended: 	September 3  ...	5610  ...	7217  ...	4324   ...	.....17Devaluation18th September(*) Met by drawings on the Canadian Credit and the International Monetary Fund, by assistance under the European Recovery Programme and by drafts on our gold and dollar holdings.23. Receipts from Americans for settlement of previous debts, and for purchases (that had been deferred and are now being made), of sterling goods,have continued at a diminished rate. It is not yet possible to say to what extentany more permanent increase in the rate of purchases has taken place, and there-fore what the future course of the deficit will be. American Account sterlingdecreased in November but there was no reconversion into dollars, and the sterlingwas probably, therefore, spent on the increased purchases mentioned above.Changes in United Kingdom Gold and Dollar Holdings(United States $/million)	Decrease	Increase1949 1st Quarter		56April.........	43	May.....	...     125	June.........	93	July   .........	...     153	August       ......	81	Weeks ended: 		September 3	29	10	56	17	14	24		4Devaluation18th SeptemberNote. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will be making an oral statement to his colleaguesregarding the more recent figures of: (i) The net gold and dollar deficit;(ii) The changes in the United Kingdom gold and dollar holdings;(iii) Reserves and liabilities.General balance of payments *24. Heavy payments for imports and invisibles (partly in order to anticipatedevaluation), and the tendency to defer inward payments, caused a steep increasein United Kingdom sterling liabilities to the non-sterling area in the third quarterof the year (Table 11), while liabilities to the sterling area fell by a smaller amountthan has been the case recently.YI.-Stocks25. After rising from 93 in March to 108 in September, the index of volumeof stocks of food and animal feeding-stuffs, raw materials and petroleum products(December 1947 = 100) is expected to decline to 103 in January 1950. this reduction reflects an expected fall in the index of food and animal feeding-stuffs
from 113 in September to 104 in January. No significant change is expected inthe level of raw material stocks and only a small decline in stocks of petroleum products during the last quarter of the year. ., .Index of Volume of Stocks in the United Kingdom(December 1947 = 100)	Total	Food and animal feeding-stuffs	Raw materials	Petroleum products	1948-49   1949-50	1948-49   1949-50	1948-49   1949-50	1948-49   1949-50March September October January	95        93 97       108 96       107 96       103O	96        93 94       113 95       114 98       104O	95        88 96       100 94        99 91         980	92       159 133       173 138       162 143       163C)(*) Forecast.YII.-prices import and Export Prices26. The index of prices of United Kingdom exports (1947 = 100) wasunchanged in October at 113 compared with 112 in October 1948. The Octoberindex of export prices reflects largely the prices of goods shipped under pre-devaluation contracts.27. The index of import prices, however, rose sharply from 111 in september to 121 in October. In general the index of import prices represents the sterlingequivalent at the new exchange rates of the prices paid for goods which arrived in October. It is estimated that changes in the prices charged by overseas suppliers in terms of their own currencies accounted for a rise of nearly 2 per cent,in the total index of import prices and that the remainder of the increase about per cent.) was due to the rise in the sterling equivalent of prices of UnitedKingdom imports as the direct result of the change in exchange rates.Retail Prices28. The index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) Was unchanged at 112 inOctober.29. The index of food prices rose by 2 per cent, to 119 owing mainly to theincrease in the maximum permitted prices of bread and flour, on 25th September.30. The index of clothing prices, which had risen steadily to 119 in Septemberdeclined in October to 117. It is expected that the recent reductions in themaximum prices of utility clothing, footwear and household textiles should besufficient to offset increases in the prices of other items of clothing and householddurable goods during the rest of this year. There was a small rise in the fuel and light index due mainly to seasonal increases.Interim Index of Retail Prices(17th June, 1947 = 100)	October	June	September	October	1948	1949	1949	1949All items        ......	108	111	112	112Food     .........	108	116	117	119Rent and rates	100	100	100	100Clothing         ......	114	118	119	117Fuel and light ...	112	113	113	114Household durable goods	109	108	108	108Miscellaneous goods ...	109	113	113	113Ssrvices.........	105	105	106	106Drink and tobacco	111	108	108	108
Wholesale Prices -     \-31. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices (1938 = 100) rose by 2-8per cent, from 226-5 in September to 232-8 in October. The index for food and tobacco increased from 205-2 to 215-3, reflecting partly the effects of devaluationand partly seasonal rises in fruit and vegetable prices. The index for industrial materials and manufactures rose from 238-3 to 242-3, the most importantincreases being in non-ferrous metals, cotton, wool, petroleum products and rubber.The total index of wholesale prices rose further in November to 236 - 3.YIII.-Wage Rates32. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)remained unchanged in October at 109.33. Increases in wage rates which became effective in October added approxi-mately  134,000 to the weekly wage of about 783,000 workers. This is much larger than the average monthly increase of  90,000 from January to September. Theprincipal increases were in building and contracting, where labourers received thefirst instalment of Is. l()d. per week of the increase of 5.?. 6d. per week agreedlast April, and in the retail food sections of the distributive trades where new statutory minimum rates came into force.34. The National Arbitration Tribunal has considered the claim for a sub7stantial wage increase in the electrical contracting industry and has refused tomake an award for six months. The Tribunal has recommended that the two parties should consider the introduction of production incentive schemes whichthe Tribunal had recommended when it awarded a Wage increase in November 1948.35. During the ten months January to October there has been a net increaseof about  946,000 in the weekly wages of 4,976,000 work people. This compares with an increase of  1,748,000 in the weekly wages of 7,159,000 work people inthe corresponding period of 1948.
