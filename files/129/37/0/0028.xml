(THIS DOCUMENT IS TIE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret. (49)  22    , COPY NO.    18TH NOVEMBER,  1949 .CABINETPUB LI0 expenditure memorandum by the chancellor&apos; of- the exchequer it may assist my colleagues in their consideration ofthe helpful memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(CP. (49) 221) if they have before them my comments on someof the points which the memorandum makes and a description ofthe instructions which I had already given for carrying forward the process of securing economies under Treasuryadministration reinforced by the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions of 4th August (CP. (49) 170) and 26th October (CP. (49) 216).2. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his memorandum the lord president- proposes that I should.-bring before the economic policy Committee a list of departments and problems which merithigh level investigation with a view to more economicaladministration,   as my colleagues know,  the whole of theadministrative machine is under constant scrutiny by theEstablislament side of the Treasury, which&apos; has just put intoforce new arrangements for control of numbers and for staffinspection.    The Organisation and Methods branches are engaged in reviewing the whole organisation of each Department,in many cases under the guidance of a Commit tee which, like theFrench Committee on the cost of Home Information Services,includes members from outside Government Service.  ^examples are the Quig Committee which has reviewed the whole structure and organisation of the Air Ministry and a similar body whichis at work in the Inland Revenue.These arrangements which are already in operation should ensure that we secure such economies as are possiblein the field of administration.   But they do not go beyond that;and given what has already been done, we cannot expect them to achieve big savings.    It is essential, if it is desired tosecure big additional economies, that investigation should go beyond administration and-examine policies.    The french committee in some degree did this.    But it was operating in a quite peculiar field;    it had to study the scope and propercost of an administrative service rendered centrally to alarge number of Ministers.    Other fields of policy involvinglarge expenditure are generally the responsibility of asingle Minister, and indeed form the essence of his duty.If I were to list, with a view to further study of economy,such activities as education,  defence,  housing, town piaiming,health,  civil aviation (these are only examples), I imagine that my colleagues would all take the view/ that the policiesinvolved were quite inappropriate for remission to bodies which included -!outsiders;! and could indeed only properly be examined by Ministers themselves, whether individuallyo r in c o.; memorandum 11 e e s....

Um In paragraph 10 of his memorandum,  the lord president refers to planning Government expenditure forseveral years ahead.    There are,  of course, some services which lend themselves to actuarial calculation.   estimates for many years ahead have been published for such services.Others again can he rapidly altered in amount by decisions fromtime to time,  bo that they can he kept to prescribed targets *But to a considerable extent future Government expenditure is determined by policy which cannot easily be radicallyaltered at short notice and whose cost year by year depends mthe working out of factors difficult to estimate in advancewith precision.5* The difficulties notwithstanding, I am in lullsympathy with, the idea of planning future expenditure.    Itwas with this end in mind that I laid before the economic policy Committee in July a forecast of budget expenditurein 1950/51 ahd 19:31/52 (3.P.0 * (h9) 76), with some very general observations on the trend of expenditure thereafter.I propose to make future forecasting a regular feature of treasury administration by arranging for a forecast ahead to bemade twice each year on the general lines of the fore-cast of last July.    One such forecast will be made in thecourse of the examination each January of the annual estimates,v,hen the expenditure of all Departments for the follov/ingfinancial year is closely reviewed and when it mil be specially useful to have the longer term trend set out inorder that it may be taken into account in the considerationof any measures which are necessary.   The other wouldconveniently be made early in July in time for consideration before the summer recess so that it can be taken intoaccount in deciding upon the Legislative Programme for thecoming Session.    Such forecasts will enable us the better to assess our ability to finance such new proposals as may be putforward.    They may also show the need to modify some of our existing policies.6.        Finally, my colleagues should know that to implement the Prime Minister1 s instruction of 26th October (CP.(h9) 216),I have instructed all divisions of the Treasury to take up with departments the securing of the economies which were put forward in reply to the instruction of the hth August (O.P. (US) 170),and in addition to advance all practicable proposals forfurther measures of administrative economy over and above those comprised in the measures covered by the announcement in Parliament on 20th October.    I am sure that I can rely upon my colleagues to give the Treasury the fullestco-operation in the securing of economies from their departments.&quot;n   c   rtTreasury Chambers, 3.W.I.,8th November, 1949.
