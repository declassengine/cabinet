ANNEX    &apos;Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament,1948-49 session my Lords and Members of the House of Commons : ^  -The long Session which is now ending has been marked by a continuanceof the economic difficulties with which we have been confronted since the end Of thewar. Fortunately there is work for all, and through the sustained efforts ofMy People a notable increase in production has been achieved. I pray that,under the guidance of Almighty God, we shall overcome the difficulties that stillbeset us and reach the goal of a stable and prosperous economy.During last winter our overseas account as a whole was brought intobalance. Trade with North America still presented special problems, but the size of the gap between receipts and payments in respect of that area was beingprogressively reduced as the drive to increase direct and indirect dollar earningsgathered momentum. Thanks to generous assistance from the Governments and peoples of the United States and Canada, together with the continued efforts ofMy People, there was every reason to believe that the gap would be closed.In the early part of 1949 a fall in demand for goods from the UnitedKingdom, and from the other countries linked with sterling, seriously affected ourearnings of dollars and the resultant difficulties were much intensified by a widespread belief that there would be an alteration in the value of the poundsterling in terms of the United States dollar. My Ministers took prompt actionto reduce imports and to initiate discussions on some of the wider aspects of theproblem. In July, a meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers was held inLondon to exchange views on the urgent economic problems confronting us. InSeptember, My Ministers in the United Kingdom and Canada met representativesof the United States Government in Washington, and discussed with them thetrade and financial relations between the sterling and dollar areas. Completeunderstanding was achieved in these talks. There was recbghitibhthat the; freerdevelopment of world trade required the sustained effort, not only of these three countries, but of all other countries which desired to promote a free exchange ofgoods throughout the world.Before the Washington discussions began My Ministers had reached theconclusion that a radical adjustment would be necessary in the rate of exchangebetween sterling and the dollar, and ah alteration in the rate was announced on18th September. In order to make the devaluation of sterling an effective aid inforeign trade, My Ministers decided upon substantial reductions in government expenditure and capital investment, thus maintaining their policy of disinflationas well as encouraging an increase in exports, especially to the dollar and otherhard-currency areas.An outstanding event during the Session was the conclusion of the north atlantic Treaty, a defensive alliance of twelve Powers, each of whom has agreed,in harmony with the Charter of the United Nations, to give mutual assistance incase of armed attack. I am convinced that this Treaty will be a powerful aid to the preservation of peace and the defence of freedom.My Government, in association with the other Governments signatory tothe Brussels Treaty, have strengthened and developed the various organisations setup under that Treaty and My Navy and Air Force have taken part in jointWestern Union exercises.Persuaded of the need for closer unity between European Nations,My Government also decided to join with other European Powers in theestablishment of a Council of Europe Members of both Houses of Parliamentattended the first meeting of the Consultative Assembly at Strasbourg in Augustas representatives from the United Kingdom. I shall watch with close interest the progress of this venture in international co-operation.My Government have continued to play their full part in the work ofthe Organisation for European P^economic Co-operation and nave taken the lead,both in proposals and in action, to free a substantial part of international trade from import controls.
My Government will continue to give whole-hearted support to the&quot;purposes and principles of the United Nations.In Germany considerable progress has been achieved by My Governmentin close collaboration with the Governments of the United States and France.The German Federal Government has been established after free elections anda. wide measure of responsibility has now been transferred to the german authorities. I welcome particularly the Petersberg Agreement recently concluded, between&apos; the Allied High Commission and the Federal Chancellor.After Berlin had been sustained for eleven months by the Allied airlift,&apos; adequatetransport services were restored and: the city has established closer relations &apos;with the Federal Republic. My Government, together with the United Statesand French Governments, have continued, unhappily without success so far,their efforts to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on fundamentalproblems affecting Germany. ,lMy Forces continue to bear throughout the world heavy responsibilities in maintaining order and preserving the peace. In Hong Kong, Malaya and elsewhere they are discharging their duties with their accustomed efficiency anddevotion. &apos;The Queen and I greatly regret,that it was not possible for us to visitAustralia and New Zealand this year, as we had hoped : and I look forward to the time when I shall have an opportunity of meeting again My Peoples inthose parts of the Commonwealth.A special conference of the Prime Ministers and other Ministers of the self-governing members;,of the. British Commonwealth was held in London inApril and I am happy to record the historic agreement then reached wherebyIndia, whilst assuming the status of a sovereign independent Republic, willcontinue in full membership of the Commonwealth, with the good will of all its members. ; In consequence I have assented to an Act which will preserveto India and her citizens the privileges of Commonwealth status under the laws of the United Kingdom and Colonies.On 31st March, Newfoundland became a province of Canada. My good wishes attend this union of the two countries which I pray may bring themlasting prosperity and well-being.I have learned with pleasure of the further generous gift which my government in the United Kingdom have received from My Government inAustralia. &apos; - &quot; &apos;        &quot;        &apos;   ;;&quot;/ &apos;The steady progress of My Colonial Peoples towards self-government within the Commonwealth has recently been demonstrated by the importantproposals for constitutional advance in the Gold Coast. I warmly welcomed thesuccess of the Colonial Month and Exhibition which I inaugurated in Londonlast June. &apos;Members of the House of Commons :     -I thank you for the provision which you have made for the public services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :I have given My Assent to a measure to amend the Parliament Act, 1911,which reduces the period during which the House of Lords may delay legislative proposals in cases of disagreement&apos; between the two Chambers.

Theco-operation of employers and workers in giving effect to this policy deserveshigh praise.An Act has been passed to give My Government the necessary powersto implement the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of life at Sea.Important changes have been made in the laws relating to patents forinventions and to registered industrial designs.Legislation has been passed for the better protection of the coast againsterosion.I have given My Assent to an Act enabling National Parks to beestablished in England and Wales and nature reserves to be provided in GreatBritain for the better protection of wild life.Preparations for the Festival of Britain, 1951, are now taking shapewith the cordial support of local authorities and voluntary organisations in all parts of the United Kingdom.I have given My Assent to legislation to improve water supplies inScotland; to protect the tenants of shops; and to amend the criminal law inScotland and the law relating to education in that country.A measure has been passed to make further provision for the organisationof civil defence.The arrangements for dealing with Welsh affairs have been strengthened by the establishment of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire.An Act has been passed to improve the administrative and financial arrangements for magistrates&apos; courts in England and Wales and to amend thelaw relating to justices of the peace.
