Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1950SECRET n Oi.- Copy No, O 1CP. (50) 1225?fA January, 1950CABINETLEGISLATION IN THE 1948-49 SESSIONNote by the Lord President of the CouncilIn the 1948-49 Session, which lasted for 42 weeks, 106 Acts were passed;this figure (which includes 5 Private Members&apos; Bills passed into law) compares with the 68 Acts which reached the Statute &quot;Book during 1947-48. The cabinet will appreciate what a heavy load the carrying through of the 1948-49 programmeof legislation has thrown on Ministers, and I may perhaps be permitted to mentionparticularly the burden borne by the Leader of the House of Lords and the Whipsin both Houses.2. My colleagues may be interested to see the attached classified List(Annex &quot;A&quot;) of the Acts which received the Royal Assent in the 1948-49Session.   I have grouped these under the following heads : (a) Legislation foreshadowed in The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament.(b) Other important legislation (i.e., essential, major or medium-sized Acts)not foreshadowed in The King&apos;s Speech.(c) Minor Acts.(d) Routine Acts.(e) Consolidation Acts.(/) Private Members&apos; Acts.3. During the course of the Session it was found necessary to pass 27 Actsnot included in the Legislative Programme, approved by the Cabinet inOctober 1948 (CM. (48) 64th Conclusions, Minute 1). On the other hand, asshown in Annex &quot; B,&quot; 13 Bills which were either included in the programme approved by the Cabinet or added to it during the course of the Session wereeventually abandoned or postponed until a hater Session.4. Eleven Consolidation Bills were passed during the Session and a statute law Revision Bill. This further excellent progress with consolidation was helped by the passage into law, and subsequent use, of the Consolidation of Enactments(Procedure) Act, 1949.H.
