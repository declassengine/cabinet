CUSTODY OF CABINET DOCUMENTSNote by the Prime MinisterMinisters relinquishing office should hand over to their successors all cabinet documents required for current administration, and should return to the cabinet office all Cabinet documents not required for that purpose.I am satisfied that under modern conditions general compliance with thisrale is necessary, in the interests of efficient administration and the safe custody of Cabinet documents.I therefore ask that Ministers relinquishing office shall not take away withthem any copies of Cabinet papers or Cabinet Committee papers now held by them.This request applies to the papers which a Minister submitted himself, as wellas to papers submitted by other Ministers.Any former Minister may at any time have access in the Cabinet Office to copies of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers issued to him while he was in office; and the services of the Secretary&apos; of the Cabinet and his staff will continueto be available to former Ministers for this purpose.C.
