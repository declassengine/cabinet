(50) 201st March, 1950CABINETTHE KING&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the council I circulate herewith, fpr consideration by the Cabinet, a draft of The King&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament which has been prepared by the Committeeon The King&apos;s Speeches. The Lord Chancellor was good enough to undertake the final revision of the draft.2. The references in the Speech to proposed legislation are consistent withthe Legislative Programme for a 1950 Session of the last Parliament, proposedby the Future Legislation Committee in CP. (49) 240 and approved by the Cabineton 1st December (CM. (49) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5). The following Billsare mentioned in the Speech : Allotments.Allotments (Scotland).Medical.Midwives.Public Utilities (Street Works).Highways (Provision of Cattle Grids)Merchant Shipping.Distribution of Industry (Amendment)Statute Law Revision Bill.Consolidation Bills.The Legislative Programme includes various essential and minor Bills which arenot mentioned in the Speech. A number of the minor Bills are unlikely to be needed, and some may not be ready for introduction until the autumn.3. The draft Speech includes, among the references to foreign affairs, a passage about the international control of atomic energy; and His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington is being consulted about the inclusion of this reference to atomic energy in the Speech. I should also draw attention to the paragraph dealing with the parliamentary situation resulting from the GeneralElection : this has been so worded as to leave it open to the Government tointroduce in the forthcoming session controversial legislation (for example,making permanent the economic controls) if this proves to be desirable.4. The Committee on The King&apos;s Speeches agreed that reference to theCoal Mining (Subsidence) Bill should be omitted from the Speech because it isdoubtful whether, in the present parliamentary situation, it would be possibleto resist amendments which would extend the scope of the Bill and so increasethe charges on the Exchequer and the National Coal Board. In these circum-stances it might be undesirable to be committed, by the terms of the Speech, tointroduce the Bill. Negotiations with interested parties may, later in the Session,indicate the feasibility of legislation on this subject.5. Several of the Bills included in the Legislative Programme have alreadybeen approved by the Legislation Committee and I am arranging for the com-pletion and submission of the remainder to the Committee at an early date.H, M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,1st March, 1950.38359
