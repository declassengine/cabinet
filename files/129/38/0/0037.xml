Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRETCP. (50) 37llth March, 1950CABINETINDO-PAKISTAN relations memorandum by the Secretary or State for Commonwealth relations think I ought to draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the fact that a potentiallydangerous situation has arisen between India and Pakistan, and I attacH anote giving the main facts, so far as they can be ascertained, about the recent disturbances in Bengal. What precisely touched off the recent conflagration isimmaterial. The fundamental cause is the deep-seated mistrust between thecountries.2. Indo-Pakistan relations have never been good, and we have alwaysrecognised that it would take time for the centuries-old feud between Hindu and moslem to die down. But the situation has been aggravated by a series ofpeculiarly intractable disputes, some of which are still acute, and relations havedeteriorated recently to such an extent that there is virtually a &quot; cold war &quot;between the countries.3. Perhaps the most serious dispute is that over the future of Kashmir.The United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan which was sent out tothe sub-Continent by the Security Council in the middle of 1948 succeeded in bringing about a cease-fire agreement and in securing agreement in principle forthe holding of a plebiscite with Admiral Nimitz as Administrator, but completelyfailed to resolve the stubborn differences that arose over the implementation ofthe Truce Agreement. In August, 1949, the Prime Minister and president truman sent messages to the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan urging themto submit these differences to arbitration: Pakistan accepted, but India refused.The matter is now before the Security Council and a resolution has beensponsored by the United Kingdom and other Delegations; this is based on theproposals of General McNaughton (who, as President of the Security Councillast December, held discussions with the two parties) and provides for(a) demilitarisation, and (b) the despatch of a United Nations representative.Pakistan is likely to accept the resolution : India (clearly after an intense internalstruggle) has indicated her willingness to do so, but seems likely to hedge heracceptance about with so many reservations that Pakistan may, in turn, feel itnecessary to adopt a more rigid attitude. The debate is due to be resumed on14th March.4. The economic warfare, arising from the failure of the two countries toagree on a rate of exchange following the devaluation of sterling, is equallydangerous. At Colombo Ministers made strenuous efforts to bring the two parties together and these were followed up at the official level. We must, if only inour own interests, continue to see if there is any way of breaking the deadlock.Proposals will be submitted separately to the Economic Policy Committee.5. There are also awkward disputes about the Punjab Canal waters andevacuee property, both of which are intimately connected with the Kashmirdispute.Into this already embittered atmosphere has now been injected the bloodshedin Bengal.38425Copy No. 3 2
Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1,Uth March, 1950.ANNEXCommunal Disturbances in BengalA dangerous situation has developed in East and West Bengal, where therehave been a series of Hindu-Muslim clashes resulting in considerable loss of life and destruction of property. Similar disturbances before the transfer of powerproduced a chain reaction culminating in the massacres in the Punjab in theautumn of 1947. The recent disturbances have caused Pandit Nehru to talk ofwar and the Indian Government to make military dispositions which the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Karachi considers will produce violent reactions in Pakistan when they become known. .   .2. East Bengal contains a minority of about 12 million Hindus and WestBengal a minority of 5 Or 6 million Muslims, a large number of whom are in Calcutta. The Hindus in East Bengal have shown considerable nervousnesssince partition and there have been periods when this has resulted in large-scalemovements of refugees across the border into Calcutta and other parts of west Bengal. The Government of India have done their best to persuade Hindusin East Bengal to regard themselves as Pakistan citizens and to look to. the pakistan Government to protect their interests.   Since the end of 1948 minority6. The most serious feature is the evidence of military preparations by india. Even if these are purely precautionary defence measures, it is obviousthat, when they become public property, they could have disastrous consequences.Fortunately the latest reports show that the tension is lessening somewhat andour acting High Commissioner at New Delhi has reported after a talk withPandit Nehru that the latter ruled out war and has no intention of resorting to force.7. It is tempting to think that the United Kingdom alone or with otherMembers of the Commonwealth should attempt to get the parties to sink their differences in the face of the wider problems that confront Hindu and Moslemalike, so that the sub-Continent, instead of being plagued by dissensions andworse, could devote its attention to raising the standard of living and so effectivelymeet the threat of Communism which threatens all countries in Asia. But our high Commissioner in India has strongly recommended that we should not atthis stage send any message to Pandit Nehru about the Bengal disturbances. Ithink this advice is sound, particularly while the two Prime Ministers themselves are in direct touch. Our attempts at intervention in the past have not beenfruitful; we have addressed counsels of moderation to both sides : Pakistan hasalways welcomed a Commonwealth initiative, but this is apt to be resented in new Delhi. Meanwhile, our High Commissioners both in New Delhi and Karachiare watching the situation very carefully and are in close contact with one another;both have spoken effectively to the two Prime Ministers.8. There is little more we can do about Kashmir while the dispute is stillbefore the Security Council. Our policy is described in paragraph 3 above and,in my view, we should stand absolutely firm on this, while continuing to make every effort to secure acceptance by both parties of the resolution at present beforethe Security Council. There is evidence that our firm stand in recent monthsis beginning to bring about a change in the Indian attitude.9. In the economic sphere, however, there are certain further steps wemay be able to take, and I suggest that it would be best to concentrate our efforts on these, since they are most likely to lead to practical results.P. C. G.-W.
committees have been established and there have been regular conferences between representatives of the East and West Bengal Governments. As a resultconfidence seemed to be returning and the movement of Hindus from East Bengalhad almost stopped until the recent disturbances flared up.3. The present disturbances began with an incident in the Khulna districton 20th December, when, as a result of action by the Pakistan police, Hindusleft the district in large numbers and fled across the border into West Bengal.From about 20th January there were anti-Muslim riots in West Bengal, notably in Calcutta, This led to anti-Hindu riots in Dacca and these were followed by further widespread attacks on Muslims and Muslim property in Calcutta. Noimpartial estimate of the casualties is available; the Government of India admit76 deaths in West Bengal up to 3rd March; the Government of Pakistan admit221 killed in East Bengal up to 27th February. There has undoubtedly beenwidespread damage to property by arson and looting.4. In February the Indian Prime Minister proposed to the Prime Ministerof Pakistan (a) that a fact-finding Commission should be appointed to investigate the disturbances, and (b) that the two Prime Ministers should make a joint tourof the affected areas. Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan rejected (a) on the grounds that theIndian Deputy High Commissioner in East Bengal already had full facilities to report on the facts to his Government and that a fact-finding Commission would inevitably develop into a fault-finding Commission which would exacerbate feeling-still further. He rejected (&amp;) on the ground that a similar tour of the Punjabin 1947 had served no useful purpose. The two Prime Ministers have continuedto exchange proposals for dealing with the situation and have agreed that theymust regard a settlement as a matter of the greatest urgency. Agreement is within sight for a joint declaration by the two Prime Ministers which will coversuch points as : (a) the discovery and punishment of persons guilty of murder, arson,looting, &amp;c.;(b) the recovery of looted property and abducted women;(c) the rehabilitation of evacuees in their former homes;(d) the adequate protection of minority communities; and\e) the discouragement of rumours and inflammatory propaganda by the press of both countries.Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan has also accepted an Indian proposal that internation red Cross representatives should visit the disturbed areas in the two Bengals.This is to be arranged very soon. In addition, Pandit Nehru has recently visitedCalcutta and proposes to return again shortly, and the Pakistan Governor-General has been touring East Bengal. Both have made strong appeals for therestoration of good relations between the two communities and riave stressed theneed for their Governments to protect minorities.5. A disturbing development is, however, a reported decision by theGovernment of India to put Indian armed forces in a state of readiness for operations against Pakistan. Urgent demands have been placed for special fuelfor armoured vehicles and the Navy in quantities greatly in excess of normal requirements. Indian troops and armour have been ordered towards the WestPunjab border and forces have also been sent to the border of East Bengal. TheAir Staff have been instructed to set up advanced air headquarters in the Punjaband at Bombay, Jammu, and Calcutta. No similar preparations have so far beenmade by the Pakistan Government. The Deputy High Commissioner at Delhidoes not believe that the Government of India are seriously contemplating resort to war. On the other hand the High Commissioner in Karachi believes that when these measures become known to the Pakistan Government their reactions arelikely to b^ violent. It seems clear that the Indian armed forces have been making preparations to meet all possible eventualities and that their presentdispositions, even if they are intended to be no more than a move in a war ofnerves, are such as would enable them at short notice to make simultaneous attacksinto both East and West Pakistan.6. Pandit Nehru is known to be under pressure&apos; from the less responsiblemembers of Congress to adopt a &quot;stronger&quot; attitude towards Pakistan. the hindu Mahasabha and the R.S.S.S. (an extremist militant Hindu organisation)have for some time been demanding an exchange of minority populations and the
&quot; reabsorption &quot; of East Bengal into the Indian Union. Sardar Patel, on theother hand, is believed to have been urging Pandit Nehru to reach a settlement with Pakistan on all outstanding issues. It is possible that the Indian military dispositions have been made as a result of the influence of Sardar Baldur Singh,the Sikh Defence Minister, who in recent speeches has shown himself to be in nomood to compromise with Pakistan; in that case they need not be taken as indicating that Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel have changed their minds aboutthe urgent need for a detente.Commonwealth Relations Offvce,Uth March, 1950.
