^^c^xJ^U  fitJ^o (8NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE : CHARGE FOR PRESCRIPTIONSMemorandum by the Minister of health i was unavoidably absent when the Lord Presidents Committee, on 20thJanuary, considered the paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this subject[L.P. (50) 3]. I have noted, with great misgiving, the conclusions reached andrecorded in the minutes of that meeting [L.P. (50) 1st Meeting, Minute 4], andI feel that I must bring the matter to the attention of the Cabinet as a whole.2. If I am to carry out the conclusions reached at the Committee&apos;&quot;s meeting,it means that I must immediately approach the medical and pharmaceuticalprofessions, inform them in detail of the procedure proposed by the treasury memorandum attached to L.P. (50) 3, and of the Governments decision to go ahead immediately with some procedure upon those lines. This would come ata moment when they are particularly ready to be disgruntled and hostile the doctors, in particular, in view of my recent rejection of their higher pay claims and when they would be quick to see the fruitful possibilities of working up an agitation, among the public no less than among themselves, within the next fewweeks.3. This would seem a most unfortunate timing. Nor, we must remember,could anything effective result in the way of introducing the charge in any case before March because no regulation could be laid while Parliament was dissolved,quite apart from the pledges already given that nothing would be done exceptwhile Parliament was sitting.4. That is my first observation on the Committee&apos;s decision that it is, tosay the least, tactically unfortunate. But I have a much more radical commentto offer as well.5. I have, not long ago, proposed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer thatimmediately after the Election we should conduct a new and thorough scrutiny of the whole of the health service and its present organisation, to see how and where economies could be effected by some changes in its detailed structure andpossibly in its legislative background. The particular matter of the charge forprescriptions ought to be re-examined as part of such a wider review.6. When it was first proposed, the shilling charge was contemplated as asingle all-round charge. The pressure for various exemptions from it has sincehad two serious effects, apart from the loss of time involved. First, it results as the Treasury memorandum demonstrates-in a complicated machinery, capable01. expensive abuse, to achieve a relatively small end. Second, it means that the^ginal estimate of a  10 million saving loses reality, and indeed I think weshould be lucky if the actual saving proved to be of the order of  5 million or so.7- Add to this that the measure would amount to singling out one particular&quot;ranch of the health service for economy cuts, and inevitable hardship cases,without any outstanding reason for discriminating against this one section of38182, ...

Ministry of Health, S. W.1,26th January, 1950.the service in this way. I am already putting in hand the major review, to whichI have just referred,;;ahd tovmy mind it would be unwise at this moment to anticipate it with this one particular, and extremely unpopular, piecemeal measure.And this, particularly, at a time when nothing practical could be done about that$measure^ - any way, in the absence of Parliament; and when such unpopularMeasure;?: would afford unfortunate opportunities to our critics in the hext^weeks.8. I ask the authority of my colleagues, therefore, in spite of the conclusion!of the Lord President^ Committee, to merge this proposal for charges foeprescriptions into the wider and more balanced review which I propose to under-take, and the results of which I hope will be available to my colleagues soon afterthe Election. ,A.
