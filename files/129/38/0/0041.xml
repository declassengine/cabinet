annex report by the Official Committee on EconomicDeveTLopment (Overseas)   *-  The Conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers atColombo approved recommendations to the participating governments on economic development in South and South-EastAsxa (text at Appendix A).      These included a recommendation for the establishment of a Consultative Committee,  the firstmeeting of which would be convened by the australian government.      The Australian Government have now for their part accepted the recommendations on this subject and havesuggested to the United Kingdom and other commonwealth governments that the first meeting of the consultative committee should be held in Canberra, beginning on 15th Mayand lasting about two weeks.      The Governments.of Canada andNew Zealand have already agreed to the suggestion of a consultative Committee, the latter proposing to be represented by a Minister.      This paper seeks Ministerial decisions solely on the immediate question of the reply which should be sent tothe Australian Government about:-(a) The proposal to hold a meeting of the consultative Committee in Canberra(b)-Tbe date) of the meeting(c) The level of representation. . .2,      The whole question of economic development in South andSouth-East Asia raises complex and critical issues forthe United Kingdom.      Ministers have already endorsed theimportance of economic development in this area (E.P.G. (h9) 152and E.p.C.(h9) 51st Meeting, Minute 1+) , while stressing the limitations on the possibilities of further financialassistance from the United. Kingdom and the central part whichwill have to be played by the United States if progress isto be made.      The general United Kingdom position was made clear at Colombo by the Foreign Secretary.      There is a very close relationship between the handling of this topic andthat of sterling balances which is to be discussed further with the United&quot;States Government.3.      These matters are being examined inter-Departmentally inorder that the issues involved can be presented to ministers for decision before Easter.      But an immediate reply must besent to  the invitation from the Australian Government.      It is recommended that the invitation should be accepted.      whatever the limitations of future action, the setting up of thisConsultative Committee is in accordance with the generalpolicy endorsed by Ministers,  and it would in any case be

undesirable to give the impression that we were going backon the attitude adopted at Colombo.      Moreover, howeverthings develop,  discussions within the Commonwealth willbe necessary and the Consultative Committee would providea convenient mechanism.k.      On the timing of the Conference, it is recommended-also that the Australian Government suggestion should beaccepted.      An earlier meeting would not be practicable inview of the time needed for considering policy here,  andalso for having informal discussions with the-United States Administration if this is considered desirable.On the other hand the meeting should not be unduly delayed,in view of the urgency of the situation in South andSouth-East Asia and the time which inevitably must elapse before any American aid could materialise.      It is importantalso to try to forestall any ill considered approach to the americans by some other Commonwealth Government.5-      Level of representation.      The Australian Governmenthave suggested that the meeting should be attended by ministers,  and it is expected that a New Zealand minister will attend.      Nevertheless we recommend that theUnited Kingdom should be represented at the official level.The United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canberra has reported that there is, amongst Australians,  some support for the view that the first meeting should be on the official level and it is understood that Canada has already indicated that it will not be possible for a Canadian Minister toattend.      Apart from the general difficulty of Ministers beingabsent from the United Kingdom in present circumstances webelieve that the work to be done at the first meeting will beessentially of the type for officials.      A further reasonagainst a Ministerial meeting is that it is important to discourage undue hopes being entertained, about the rate of progress in the early stages of the Consultative Committee;the presence of Ministers&apos;on the other hand will inevitablysuggest that something more is to be expected from themeeting than, we believe,  can possibly be the case.6.      In the reply to Australia and the other commonwealth governments,  it will be necessary for the United KingdomGovernment to refer to their attitude on the recommendations&quot;in Appendix A as a whole.      Their implications will need tobe studied in detail before the Canberra meeting,  though theyare all couched in very general terms.      The only specificobligation is that under A(iii)  &quot;to contribute to the,technical assistance work of the United Nations and itsSpecialised Agencies&quot;, and the United Kingdom is already doing so.      It is recommended,  therefore, that without formallyreserving our position on the recommendations we should makeit clear&quot;that their detailed implications need to be discussed by the Consultative Committee,7.      In the light of the above considerations it is recommended that Ministers should approve the draft telegramat Appendix B, which:-(i) accepts the invitation and agrees to theproposed date;(ii) proposes representation at the official level;(iii) safeguards our position on the implications of the recommendations by Indicating thatwe expect these to be discussed at the consultative Committee when it meets.

8.      We should add that the South African Governmenthave said that they will he unable to take part in thework of the Consultative Committee because of theircommitments in Africa.      We believe that South Africamight, neverthelessj be able to provide useful technicalexperience.      We therefore recommend that the australian government should be invited to try to get South Africa to reconsider her suggestion; and that the United kingdom should use her own -influence in this-direction.16th March, 1950.(Signed) E. N.   PLOWDENChairman

THE COLOMBO RECOMMENDATIONS ON ECONOMIC POLICYIN SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST ASIAA. &apos; The Conference, of Commonwealth Foreign Ministersrecommends that the participating Government should.-(i)  examine the possibility of making financial assistanceavailable for essential productive purposes inSouth and South East Asia, taking into accounttheir existing commitments;(ii)   support as high a priority as possible for projectspresented to the International Bank for reconstruction and Development which would contribute to theeconomic well being of the area and would be inaccordance with the Bank&apos;s objectives;(iii)  contribute to the technical assistance work of theUnited Nations and its Specialised Agencies,  and tosupport in these organisations as high a priority aspossible for the needs of South and South East Asia;(iv)  examine the possibility of making supplementarybilateral arrangements in. appropriate cases for theprovision of direct technical and other assistance^(v)  generally,  consider proposals for the economic development of the area, keeping in view thepossibilities of mutual assistance.B. With a view to the implementation of these recommendations the Conference further recommends the  establishment of a consultative   Committee,  membership   of which will be open toall Commonwealth Governments which wish to participate, withthe following terms of references(i)  to receive from Governments an indication of theaction which they consider it feasible to  take in response to the recommendations in Section A.(ii)  to approach the Governments of countries outsidethe Commonwealth interested in the area with aview to enlisting their collaboration.(iii)  to examine the methods of co-ordinating developmentactivities in South and South East Asia, in association with international and regional organisa-tions concerned with the object or raising the level ofproduction and the standard of living in the area.(iv)  to examine the desirability of promoting international commodity agreements for basic products, which would benefit the area and could be recommended forconsideration under the Havana Charter.(v)  to consider whether the economic development of under-developed countries of the area would be assisted bythe drawing up of a co-ordinated plan of development and by the establishment of special machinery.(vi)  to make recommend at ions to Governments.C. If these recommendations are accepted the australian government would be pleased to accept the responsibility ofconvening the first meeting of the Consultative Committee inAustralia.

Recommendations of-the Colombo Conference.1.      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom acceptthe recommendation to establish a Consultative Committee andare glad to accept your invitation to the first meeting ofthe Committee.      We agree that this should be held as soonas practicable and accept your suggestion that it should begin on 15th May.2.      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom assume that the Consultative Committee will consider in greater detail the implications of the recommendations made at themeeting in Colombo on 13th January.3.      We are inclined to think that the work at the firstmeeting will be essentially of the sort to be done by officials, and in any case we should find it very difficult in present circumstances to arrange for a Minister to attend.We are therefore arranging for senior officials to representthe United Kingdom.
