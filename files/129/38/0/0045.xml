CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW.   19*50Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department,  the Minister of AgricultureFisheries and the Secretary of state for sbo^land at their meeting on 9th March (c.M.(50) 9thConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet agreed that the agriculture ministers should open the annual review of agricultural priceson the basis of price recoupment to farmers of  12^ millions in respeot of estimated increases in costs of some  37i millions.2* The subsequent discussions with the leaders of thethree Farmers1 Unions of the United Kingdom revealed thatthere was no possibility of agreement on this basis.   Theleaders of the Farmers&apos; Unions at first claimed price recoup-ment of some  30 millions to meet the total increased costs of 37&apos;2&quot; millions,  -and then held out strongly for a figure of atleast  22 millions.   After consultation with the Minister ofState for Economic Affairs and the Minister of Food we instructedour officials to explore with the Unions the practicability of supplementing the direct price recoupment proposals (of  12^millions) by short-term grant-aided schemes designed to giveeffect to the desire of the Cabinet to promote greater productivity from grassland and marginal land.    The Ministerof Food,  in giving his assent to this approach, reserved hisposition regarding possible effects on the cost of food tothe consumer.3- We are now able to report that after detailed and difficult negotiations our officials have informed us thatGovernment decisions as follows would be accepted by the farmers&apos; leaders and commended by them to the fanning community as a reasonable settlement in present circumstances:(a) Increases in prices of sheep, cattle, pigs and milk.    It is proposed to cease acreage payments on early potatoesand to use this saving of  2f millions,  together with the 12^: millions authorised by the Cabinet, to raise the pricesof these livestock products.(b) No price increase for eggs, or any crops.(c) Schemes,  estimated to cost (for the United kingdom as a Y/hole)  5 millions in the year July, 1950 - June,  1951,for encouraging the application of fertilisers to grass andmarginal land, and the ploughing up of old grassland forre-seeding and the growing of arable crops.(d) An extension of the existing Marginal Production Schemeto afford relief to small producers of milk, pigs and eggs whoare heavily dependent on purchased feedingstuffs and whose farmsare of such a size or character that they have little opportunityS E C R E T j/CP.

by means of grassland improvement or otherwise to make themselvesreasonably.self-sufficient,   ho benefit would go to largefarmers or those whoso other sources of income were such thatthey could reasonably afford to bear the higher cost of feeding-stuffs.    The total annual cost of this proposal would belimited to  1.33 millions in the United Kingdom,(e)    A further extension of the existing Marginal ProductionScheme to give additional stimulus to the reclamation of smallareas of some-derelict land, etc.    (Maximum cost  670,000.)h. The salient feature of the proposed price decisions((a) and (b)  in the preceding paragraph)  is that the whole ofthe sum available would be applied as a contribution torecouping cost increases on those livestock products (otherthan eggs) which will be most affected by higher feedingstuffsprices and the production of which it is most necessary to stimulate.5. The grants proposed under (o),  (d)  and (e)  above are designed to promote agricultural efficiency and productivity, and should not in our vie?/ count againstthe total food subsidy ceiling or, unlike the  12-j; millions for direct recoupment for farm prices,  involve any additionto consumer prices of food.6* The fertiliser schemes (b) would take effect from 1st July next and will require legislation in due course.    Boththe fertiliser and the marginal production schemes willrequire supplementary estimates for 1950/51*    The extent towhich farmers,  in the face of substantially higher costs ofproduction, will take advantage of these grants,  is,  however,highly speculative.   We believe that it will take some little time for farmers to realise the benefit which they can obtain from these sources, and that in the first year at least actual expenditure may fall below our estimates.   Expiry dates wouldbe discussed with the Treasury before being embodied in.legislation or Statutory Instruments.    They would probably bevarying dates in 1953, with provision for possible extension-after a review in 1952.7. The extension of the existing short-term marginal production Scheme is not proposed in substitution for the wider and long-term proposals for reconditioning marginal landreferred to in. paragraph 21 of CPs. (50)  2h*    These proposals are nearing completion and will be the subject of -a further memorandum, as the Cabinet requested on 9th March(C*M.(50) 9th Conclusions, Minute 2(2)).    They will require legislation;    thoy willxmainly affect landownersT and nottenants&apos; expenditure;    and it will inevitably take years beforethe schemes result in an increase of products (mainly meat)  forsale off the farm.

8&quot; Summarised, the price review proposals are as follows/ \   ^.&apos;   millionsla;    Direct price recoupmenti piGrant-aided production schemes         millions(b) Fertilisers on grasslandand marginal land h(c) Fertilisers on ploughed-up old grassland 1(d) Extension of marginal production Scheme toassist purchase offe edings tuffs 1.33(e) Extension of marginal production Scheme toencourage reclamationof semi-derelict landetc. .67 7Total reimbursement towards _^meeting the increased costs of 37&apos;ii millions 19?* Additional to the existing provision of 600,000 por annum in Great Britain.9* We strongly recommend a settlement on this basis as a very reasonable solution to an extremely difficult problem.    We feel that the farmers&apos; leaders have shown courageand statesmanship in undertaking to commend to their members&quot;decisions which will involve influential,  and vociferous,sections of the farming community in meeting substantial increases in costs with no recoupment.   We accordingly inviteour colleagues to endorse these proposals and authorise us to announce forthwith the new schedule of prices and the accompanyingmeasures for improving the productivity of grass and marginalland and for easing the difficulties that would otherwise ariseto a large number of small marginal producers of milk, pigs and eggs.Minimum Prices10. The Agricultural Act, 19h7, obliges us,  some time during 1950, to fix and announce guaranteed minimum prices for milk,  fat cattle,  sheep and pigs, and eggs for 1952/53 and 1953/5h*Difficult questions of policy will need to be settled before these minimum prices can be determined and we are proposing to submit,   in conjunction with the Minister of Pood, amemorandum to our colleagues on the subject.    In the meantimewe have agreed with the Farmers1 Unions to postponeconsideration of this matter for four or five weeks.  -J . C . lb .T.W.H.McN.
