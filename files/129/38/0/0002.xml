Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1950.secret copy No.3iCP. (50) 24th January, 1950CABINETTOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS MARKETING scheme memorandum by the President oe the Board of trade. The Official Committee on Restrictive Practices by Supervisory boards have recently reported on a draft Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme,but they have been unable to reach agreement on any of the important restrictiveaspects of the Scheme. (A copy of the report is annexed.) At their meeting on16th December, 1949, the Lord Presidents Committee, after discussing my memorandum on the Scheme (L.P, (49) 96), invited me to submit the issues raised to the Cabinet (L.P. (49) 22nd Meeting, Minute 1 (4)).2. The Tomatoes and Cucumbers Scheme has been the first new scheme tobe considered by the Official Committee since the passing of the agricultural marketing Act, 1949. The failure of the Official Committee to achieve any agreedconclusion from their examination of the Scheme is due to a conflict about a major issue of principle, and it is this issue to which I invite the considerationof my colleagues.3. The Official Committee&apos;s difficulty has been to reconcile their terms ofreference, as derived from a decision of the Lord Presidents Committee on21st February, 1947, (L.P. (47) 6th Meeting, Minute 3), with the policy under-lying the Agricultural Marketing Acts, especially the new Act of 1949. Theterms of reference are that &quot; existing restrictive powers &quot;(of boards supervisingand operating statutory schemes of control of production or marketing inprivately-owned industries) &quot; and proposals for the granting of new powers should be examined and continued or given only when there is no better way of achieving a particular object and only when this object is important enough tojustify the risks entailed!&quot; This wording, and other passages of the final report of an Interdepartmental Committee on Restrictive Practices by Super-visory Boards (L.P. (47) 1) from which it is taken, can bear no other interpretationthan that restrictive powers should be given, to marketing boards only as a very exceptional measure and only when it is clear that really important objectivescannot be attained in any other way. On the other hand, the agricultural marketing Acts list a number of restrictive powers which Parliament has thoughtit appropriate for marketing boards to exercise, always subject, of course, to the overriding supervisory functions of the Ministers responsible for agriculture.The clear implication here is that the grant of restrictive powers would not beunusual.4. The above-mentioned decision of the Lord Presidents Committee on21st February, 1947, has been reinforced by a later decision. The Jay Committeeon Food Distribution, while welcoming the new powers of supervision to be givento the Agriculture Ministers in the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1949, recom-ended, as a further safeguard, that restrictive provisions in marketing schemesfor non-guaranteed-price products should continue to be examined by the official committee and submitted to Ministers for approval. The adoption of thatrecommendation at a meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on 24th September,1948 (L.P. (48) 14th Meeting, Minute 1) is the latest specific Ministerial directiveon the subject. It lends weight to the view that the Official Committee should puta strict interpretation on its terms of reference : and this is the line taken,broadly speaking, by the Ministry of Food representative and the economistmembers of the Official Committee.
5. Against this, the Departments of Agriculture point out that the Agri-cultural Marketing Bill passed through most of its stages after the meetingof the Lord Presidents Committee on 24th September, 1948. When in 1947the Government introduced their policy of guaranteed prices and assured markets for the main agricultural products, horticultural products were excluded fromthese benefits on the ground of insuperable administrative difficulty. But anundertaking was then given that the Government intended the same generalobjective to apply to the whole industry, and that other means of attaining itwould be devised for non-guaranteed-price products. One main, way of carryingout this policy is through marketing schemes; and the contention is that theCabinet and Parliament would not have approved the 1949 Act, nor given the agriculture Ministers close supervisory powers over the operations of marketing boards, unless there was a general expectation that the powers in question wouldfrequently be made available to marketing boards. Consequently, the departments of Agriculture put much more stress on the supervisory functions of their ministers over the actual exercise of powers than on the initial examination ofthe powers sought. It is true that the Minister of Agriculture, on the secondreading of. the Agricultural Marketing Bill, 1949, said that &quot; all proposalsinvolving the granting of new or amended restrictive powers are subjected tothorough examination by the Board of Trade.&quot; He added that this would beho formality; and presumably he had in mind the work of the Official Committeewhen referring to &quot;examination by the Board of Trade.&quot; Nevertheless, theDepartments of Agriculture point out that, as a matter of administration, tidepowers to be granted to marketing boards cannot be defined very closely at the start, since any amendment or extension found to be required in practice can beachieved only at the cost of the usual delays of statutory procedure.. 6. These two views are hard to reconcile. Each side feels that it is particii-larly important to maintain its position on the tomatoes scheme because this isthe first new scheme to be examined and the final decision on this case may well become a precedent for several more agricultural marketing schemes which theindustry propose to put forward.7. I feel that, with my general responsibility for policy on monopolies and restrictive practices, I should now try to help towards a solution of the present difficulty by relating the problem to the main lines of policy in this field. the monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, is the vehicle of this policy as it applies to private industry. The doctrine on which this legislation is based is that restrictive business practices can be neither condonednor condemned by a Government department as a matter of policy. It is recognisedthat they may do harm to the public interest and that the Government should be ina position to refer prima facie cases of restrictive practices to an independent bodycharged with the duty of discovering the facts and reporting on their impact on certain defined aspects of public interest. Hence we have set up the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission.8. It is obviously important that statutory bodies should not be permitted toindulge in practices which, if carried on in private industry, would be reported asdetrimental to the public interest by the Monopolies Commission. On the otherhand, it is unreasonable that statutory bodies should be prevented from doing what their sponsors believe to be in the public interest simply on a chance that similar practices in private industry would be adversely, reported on. Until the monopolies Commission has reported on several references, there is no case law to guide us.9. I have been looking at the process of reference and investigation by the monopolies Commission to see whether there is any similar procedure which mightbe applied to supervisory boards. Under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1949,any marketing board exercises its statutory powers subject to the supervision ofthe. Minister of Agriculture. Should the Minister find that any activity of aBoard in the exercise of restrictive powers appears to be contrary to the publicinterest, he may give directions to the Board to remedy the situation. But before he&quot; doe&quot;s so, the Board are entitled to ask that the matter in question be referredto a Committee of Investigation.. 10. It can be argued that this procedure of letting the Board exercise powersuntil they appear to have overstepped the mark, and then referring the matter
for investigation by an independent body, is a close parallel to the procedurewhereby the Board of Trade refer restrictive practices in private industry to the monopolies Commission. The parallel is underlined by the fact that a memberof the Monopolies Commission has been appointed to the Committee of Investi-gatidn under the Agricultural Marketing Act in order to secure a similarity of approach to the problems which come before the two bodies.11. If a Monopolies Commission report shows that restrictive practices have operated contrary to the public interest, and Parliament endorses this view, then the appropriate Department may make an Order declaring them illegal, i.e,,stopping them altogether. The analogy of the Monopolies Commission procedure,when applied to marketing boards, assumes that a number of instances will occurof a board operating in a way which seems to the Minister injurious to the publicinterest. The Minister will then arrange for a full examination by the Committeeof Investigation; and, if the findings of the Committee agree with the Ministersadverse view, then the Minister may amend the scheme so as to take away fromthe board the misused powers, or revoke the scheme altogether.12. The analogy is, of course, very broad and is by no means perfect. Thepractices which are within the scope of the Monopolies Act have grown up byfree decision of private industry and without any statutory or Governmentalsanction. The powers granted to a marketing board, on the other hand, are granted as an act of Government. Consequently, if the board are found subse-quently to be operating in a way harmful to the public interest, and using their powers to compel producers to participate in the operation, this might well berepresented as lack of foresight and judgment on the part of the Government. Asagainst this, the Ministry of Agriculture assert that the powers already grantedto marketing boards have never been abused.13. Under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1949, the Minister of Agri-culture has a responsibility for current supervision of the activities of marketing boards. If the Minister considers that an act or omission of the board is or willbe contrary to the public interest, then he may take remedial measures by a direction which, if challenged by the board, has to be referred to the Committeeof Investigation before being brought into effect. He may also issue temporarydirections in cases where restraint has to be placed on the board before a fullinvestigation can be held. In contrast to this, there are, under the Monopolies Act,no similar powers of current supervision which the Board of Trade or othercompetent authorities can exercise prior to an investigation by the monopolies commission.14. The opponents of the tomatoes scheme have, however, expressed grave doubts whether effective supervision currently by the Minister would be practicable in respect of the price of any perishable produce. If the effect of the Board&apos;operations in a glut period were to raise the price to the ordinary consumer above.what it would otherwise be, this adverse effect on the public interest might lastonly for a few days. It is doubtful (so the argument runs) whether the Ministersintervention, even by temporary direction, could have effect until the situationgiving rise to it had passed. Moreover, the onus would be on the Minister toestablish his case against the Board&apos;s price operations; and since, by hypothesis,the Board&apos;s prices would be in force at the time of his intervention, he would find it difficult to prove that the prices would have been lower but for theBoard&apos;s action.15. It is in face of these difficulties that the Minister of Agriculture wouldhave to use his powers of swift intervention in order to discharge his responsi-bilities to the consumer as well as to the producer. Action by means of temporarydirection, which might appear arbitrary except where the Board&apos;s activities were :flagrantly injurious, might result in strained relations with the industry. Asimilar, and perhaps more serious situation, might arise when the Minister usedhis most effective sanction his powers to amend or to revoke the marketing scheme on a report from a Committee of Investigation. All these factors will have to betaken into account if all the restrictive provisions of the tomatoes scheme areto be accepted on the ground that reliance solely upon the Ministers powers is a ;sufficient safeguard of the consumers&apos; interest.16. Thus the problem before us is whether the policy underlying the 1Agricultural Marketing Acts or the doctrine enunciated in L.P. (47) 1 should
have primacy in this field. A decision in favour of the former would involve a risk that marketing boards, using statutory powers, might, for a time, engage in practices of a kind which may be found harmful by the Monopolies Commissionin industries referred to them: the risk would be limited by the Ministersconstant supervision of the Board&apos;s activities (so far as this is practicable) and hisfinal power to amend a scheme or suspend it altogether. Alternatively, a decision in favour of the doctrine enunciated in L.P. (47) 1 may conflict with undertakings given to the agriculture industry.17. The conclusion we reach on this major issue will, no doubt, govern thedecision (which the Minister of Agriculture is anxious to obtain as soon aspossible) on the question whether the tomatoes and cucumbers scheme, in itspresent form, should be approved.H. W.Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W. 1,4th January, 1950.
ANNEXOFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES BYSUPERVISORY BOARDSReport on the Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing SchemeIntroductory &apos;1. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has asked us to examine the restrictive provisions of the draft Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme.This request was made in accordance with the decision taken by the Lord Presi-dentV Committee on 21st February, 1947 L.P. (47) 6th Meeting, Minute 3 when a recommendation of an earlier official committee was approved. Thisrecommendation was that &quot;existing restrictive powers and proposals for thegrant of new powers should be examined and continued or given only when thereis no better way of achieving a particular object and only when this object isimportant enough to justify the risks entailed.&quot; This recommendation also con-stitutes our terms of reference.2. This is the first new Scheme which we have examined. We have to*report that, although in the view of the majority of the Committee, the restrictivepowers sought under the scheme would not be justified by the criteria laid downin our terms of reference, we are unable to make any unanimous recommendations,as to whether Ministers should approve or reject the scheme.3. Consequently in this report we have simply set out what this Scheme is.and what it aims to do, drawing attention to the restrictive powers which it wouldgrant, and then rehearsing the main arguments which have emerged in our dis-cussions for and against the grant of each particular power.The scheme. In April, 1948, the National Farmers&apos; Union submitted a draft Schemeto the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Secretary of State ForScotland. After notice had been given in the press and six weeks had been allowed for objections to be made, a public inquiry was held by Mr. A. C. Longland, K.C.Mr. Longland recommended a number of amendments to meet points raised byobjectors and the Agriculture Departments prepared a list of amendments basedon his report. In the course of our examination and as a result of discussions between the Ministries of Agriculture and Food and the Board of Trade, further amendments have been drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture to meet points of criticism which have been raised. In this report we consider all these amend-ments as if they were an integral part of the Scheme. We have had before uscopies of Mr. Longland&apos;s report and of explanatory material produced by theNational Farmers&apos; Union.5. The greater part of the Scheme consists of measures designed to make theproduction and marketing of tomatoes and cucumbers more efficient. Many ofthese provisions which deal, for example, with advertising, the collection of statistics, market intelligence and co-operative research, are not restrictive andare not unlike the functions which may be given to a Development Council underthe Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947. We have not, of course,been concerned with this aspect of the Scheme.6.   The text of the restrictive provisions in the draft is given in the Appen-dix to this Report.   There are three restrictive Articles Article 68 prohibits the sale of tomatoes and cucumbers by producerswho are neither registered nor exempt from registration under the Scheme.Article 70 (i) gives the Board power to determine the channels through which tomatoes and cucumbers may be sold and the conditions of sale. (Salesby retail, sales for use and sales to retailers are exempt from this provisionunder Article 70 (2).)Article 73 gives the Board power at any time after the Scheme has comeinto force and on a two-thirds affirmative vote in a poll of producers, toexercise some or all of certain extra powers set out in the Article and to cancel by resolution the exemptions provided under Article 70 (2). TheMinister&apos;s consent is also necessary before the extra powers can be taken.
7.   Three of these extra powers are restrictive Article 73 (A) gives the Board power to decree that all tomatoes andcucumbers (or specified descriptions or quantities of tomatoes or cucumbers)shall be sold only to or through the Board,Article 73 (B) gives the Board power to determine maximum, minimumor fixed prices for sales of tomatoes and cucumbers by producers.Article 73 (F) gives the Board power to lay down compulsory rules forthe grading, packing, storage, insurance, transport, &amp;c, for any descriptionor quantity of tomatoes and cucumbers.8.   The objects of the Scheme are stated by the promoters to be -(a) to lower the cost of production;(b) to increase yield and improve quality, grading and packing; -(c) to encourage the setting up of co-operative marketing societies in certain areas;(d) to lower the cost of marketing;(e) to improve distribution.Although the restrictive powers may have the effect of furthering the first two of these objects, they are said to be designed primarily to achieve the last two.9. We have reached agreement about two points raised by these restrictiveproposals (a) We recommend that Article 68 be approved, because under the Agricul-tural Marketing Act of 1931 registration must be open to any producerwho applies for it and we do not therefore regard this provision asrestrictive in practice.(&amp;) We agree also that Article 73 (F), which gives the Board compulsory powers to lay down methods of grading, might be approved, providedthat the Board use a system of grading which does not prevent anyproperly consumable food from reaching the wholesale market.This narrows the issues in dispute to Articles 70 (1) and 73, which are,however, the essence of the Scheme.The Case for and against Article 70 (1)10. . This Article would enable the Board to compile a list of wholesalers orcommission salesmen and lay it down that producers must sell their goods to or through those on the list. They could also lay down the descriptions of tomatoeswhich could be sold and the terms of sale. For example, under this Article theycould ban sales on commission altogether. Sales direct from the producer toprocessors or retailers or the general public would be exempt under Article 70 (2)from this provision. Any wholesaler or commission salesman who found his nameomitted from the Board&apos;s list, or who subsequently had his name removed, wouldhave the right of appearing before the Board to state his case for inclusion.If this failed, he could complain to the Minister and have his case examined bythe Committee of Investigation under the Agricultural Marketing Acts.11. The promoters of the Scheme want this power in order to be able, intheir own words, to compile a register of &quot; approved commission salesmen whoseintegrity can be relied on and who undertake to observe reasonable commissionand handling rates.&quot; In compiling such a register they would consult with theAdvisory Committee provided for by Article 29a. This Committee would include(distributors, but they would be appointed by the Board itself.12,   The reasons advanced for taking this power are :-       1(a) That a measure of control over wholesale distribution and over the systemof sales on commission has been agreed to be necessary in order to remedy acknowledged defects.(6) The power when coupled with Article 73 (A) would be used to preventthe sale of tomatoes unsuitable for consumption by the general public and detrimental to the. reputation of home-produced tomatoes. Sub-standard tomatoes would be directed to processors or other designatedbuyers.
(c) The machinery of consultation with the Advisory Committee and of appeal by wholesalers left&apos;out of the list are sufficient safeguards against anyabuse of this power.13.   The main objections to this power are as follows : (a) It would be wrong to prevent low grades of tomatoes from reaching thepublic, who so long as they know what they are buying, should beable to decide for themselves in a free market whether. they want to buy such tomatoes at low prices.(b) The exercise of this power really involves a form of licensing of distribu-tors. The Jay Committee recommended against licensing in this field.Moreover, the whole experience of the Ministry of Food has shown thatlicensing, even by a Government Department, tends to be restrictive.It is suggested that licensing by a producers&apos; board would certainly not be less so. Great improvements in supplies to the public at reason-able prices have been obtained by throwing open this trade to themaximum degree of competition, and it is the Governments policy tocontinue this.(c) The safeguards for distributors excluded from the Board&apos;s list are notadequate, since the Board appoints the Advisory Committee and itselfhears appeals. Distributors who are excluded stand to lose their tradenot only in tomatoes and cucumbers, but also in other produce.Article 7314. The extra powers given by Article 73, about which the Committee hasnot reached agreement, would give the Board power to require all producers tosell all or any part of their output only to the Board or through the agency ofthe Board and would allow the Board to fix prices for sales made by producers.15. The case made by the sponsors of the Scheme for these powers rests on three main grounds : (a) Distribution and marketing arrangements are said at present to be unsatisfactory and to compare badly with the arrangements adoptedby the Channel Islands producers. The power to direct sales throughthe agency of the Board is required to reinforce Article 70 (1) so asto enable the Board to plan and carry out a scheme of organisedassembly and distribution which would prevent the wasteful reconsign-ment which now often occurs and the simultaneous existence of localsurpluses and shortages in different parts of the country. Thesponsors expect that this power, when once obtained, would be exercisedgenerally and continuously.(&amp;) General &quot; gluts &quot; occur from time to time. It is desirable that there shouldbe satisfactory arrangements for processing surplus supplies whengluts occur. If a spell of good weather ripens large quantities oftomatoes quickly and is immediately followed by cold weather, whichreduces demand, a state of glut may arise quickly. A glut is saidto exist when the prices which tomatoes will fetch under open market conditions are barely sufficient to cover the costs of packing, picking,transport to the market and selling costs. It is suggested that at suchtimes the Board would step in and direct the surplus to processorsunder Article 70. This is why the assumption of these extra powers would entail the cancellation of the exemptions in Article 70 (2). Bytheir powers of determining grades and descriptions, the Board would ensure that the surplus was made to consist of the lowest grades oftomatoes. But in order to ensure that the producers received reason-able prices, the Board might have to negotiate as sole seller with theprocessors or, if it did not handle the whole of the surplus itself, theBoard might fix prices at which producers made direct sales.(c) In any arrangements to develop sales of perishable goods to processors,who have to plan their programmes ahead, either national price agree-ments or a contract system are necessary. No national price agreement is possible without some price-fixing machinery.
16. The main arguments against the extra powers granted to the board under Article 73 are :- ;(a) The power to require all sales to producers to be made to or throughthe Board is wider than is necessary for the purpose in view. while there may be no intention to establish a monopoly, this power wouldenable the Board to act as a monopolist.(b) These powers, if once given, would require a considerable full-timeadministrative machinery to operate them. They could not, therefore,be turned on and off and would, in fact, tend to be exercised all thetime and without time limit:(c) There might well be no general agreement about the existence of a glutrequiring the special measures outlined above. There might be atendency for the Board to take special measures in order to protect the producer before the public had felt the full benefit of plentiful supplies.The effect might then be to maintain the price to the consumer abovethe point it would reach under market conditions. (There is no evidence of distress among tomato-growers, who are said to havethe highest incomes of all agricultural producers; and, indeed, theScheme is not sponsored on the ground that tomato-growing isunremunerative.)(d) Glut conditions are necessarily those in which the processing firms do their largest buying. Consequently it is not clear what extra measures the Board could take to move tomatoes in a glut when producers wouldin any case be making the largest possible sales to processors.(e) Although it is not part of the objects of the Scheme to do so, the board would be under pressure to exert its price leadership or monopolypower and its price-fixing powers to secure a better return forproducers than is obtainable in comparable classes of investment.Competition from imported produce could not in all circumstanceseliminate the danger of the: public having to pay too much. In anycase the tendency has been for marketing boards of this type to lay stress on the desirability of restricting imports in order &quot;to sustaintheir marketing arrangements.17. The over-riding objection which has been urged against these powers isthat they have not been shown to be the only way or the best way of achieving theends in view, nor have the ends been shown to&apos; be so important as to outweigh the risks. If improved efficiency in distribution is required, methods could beand ought to be found which do not involve the licensing of distributors or the taking of monopoly selling powers. If it is found by experience that processorsin times of good supply can impose low prices on producers, it would be possiblefor the Board to take advantage of their power under the Scheme to set up asa processor. This would not involve price fixing.18. Our Report may thus be summed up as disclosing a fundamental difference of aproach. The sponsors of the Scheme and the Agricultural Depart-ments rest their case for the Scheme on the need for organising marketing anddistribution. They stress the need for compulsory powers without which anyplanning of the process of distribution may be vitiated by minority action orinaction. They contend that Marketing Schemes have not in the past raised prices or operated to the detriment of the consumer. Certainly, they hold, it is the inten-tion of the present Scheme to provide for the consumer a better quality and more plentiful output at reasonable prices. The Board must have powers to operateany workable Scheme, and this fact is recognised in the Agricultural MarketingAct, 1949, recently passed by Parliament.19. Against all this the opponents pf the Scheme say that, however good theirinitial intentions, a producers&apos; Board is not the right body of people to holdpower to restrict entry into distribution, to run licensing schemes which arein any case out of line with the Governments general policy on distribution, orto decide at what point the market price for their own produce is so low as torequire special measures, including the fixing of minimum prices.. Historically, they say, the imperfections of our methods of distribution inthis field are due precisely to protection and restriction and they&apos; compare the advances made in America in methods of distribution through a thorough-goingencouragement of competition. They do not regard the Minister of Agriculture^powers of supervision as likely to be effective when, in the nature of this kind
of produce, the supply and demand situation may change over-night. The board might use its powers in a time of alleged glut in ways contrary to the publicinterest. By the time the Minister could consider the ease for his intervention,the glut would be over and the damage done. .Finally the opponents of the Scheme support any attempt to improvemarketing methods by, for example, co-operative marketing Schemes or byactivities similar to those of a Development Council. If there is a surplus inLondon and a shortage in Manchester, they see no reason why a Marketing board should not purchase supplies and do its best to even out distribution over thecountry. They consider that a great deal could be done in these ways. But theydo not think, on the basis of our terms of reference, that a case has been made out to show that the restrictive powers proposed in the Scheme are necessary or arethe only means of achieving the justifiable objects of the producers.9th December, 1949.Appendix to Official ReportArticle 294 (i)The Board shall set up and appoint an advisory committee which shallconsist of members of the Board and of persons who, in the opinion of the Board,represent the views of wholesale and retail salesmen and processors of tomatoesand cucumbers.Article 68Subject to the provisions of the Acts with respect to existing contracts andto the provisions of this part of the Scheme, a producer who is neither registerednor exempt from registration shall not sell any tomatoes or cucumbers either inGreat Britain or elsewhere.Article 70(1) The Board may from time to time determine the description of tomatoesand cucumbers which may be sold by registered producers and the terms on whichtomatoes and cucumbers or any description; or quantity thereof may be sold asaforesaid and, after consultation with the Advisory Committee established underthe provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 29A of this scheme, the persons to or through the agency whom tomatoes and cucumbers or any description orquantity thereof may be sold as aforesaid : Provided that  .(i) nothing in this Part of this Scheme shall affect the right of registered producers to select from among the persons so determined the persons to or through the agency of whom they sell; and(ii) if the Board propose to remove the name of any person from any list ofpersons so determined as aforesaid or propose not to include in suchlist the name of any person who has notified them in writing of his desire to be included therein, the Board shall give written notice tothat person specifying the action proposed to be taken and informing him of the effect of this proviso and if such person, by notice in writingserved on the Board within twenty-one days after the service of thelast mentioned notice, requires that an opportunity be afforded him ofbeing heard by the Board, such an opportunity shall be afforded to him and the Board shall not take the action in question until they have considered any representations made at the hearing.(2) The following classes of sale shall be exempt from any determination ofthe Board under this paragraph, namely : (a) Sales by retail, which means sales to buyers who buy for domestic consumption without further re-sale;(b) Sales for use, which means sales direct to persons who buy for domestic consumption without further retail;(c) Sales to retailers, which means sales direct to persons whose ordinary business as to tomatoes and cucumbers is to sell them wholly or mainly to buyers who buy for domestic consumption without further re-sale.
