Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRETCP. (50) 3313^ March, 1950CABINETCopyn31RECOGNITION OF staff ASSOCIATIONS IN THE POST office memorandum by the Postmaster-general. At their meeting on 15th December, 1949 (CM. (49) 72nd Conclusions,Minute 4), the Cabinet approved a proposal about recognition of staff associationsin the Post Office submitted by my predecessor in CP. (49) 241 (revise). this involved a restatement of the general policy (omitting all reference to the 40 percent, membership which had hitherto been a prerequisite for considering claims to recognition and laying down certain general factors which would be taken intoaccount in considering such claims) and an undertaking to consider the claim of the Engineering Officers&apos; (Telecommunications) Association claim in thelight of the factors set down. It was expected that this Association^ claim wouldbe rejected and in all probability the other outstanding claims would have beensimilarly rejected. The dissolution of Parliament made it impossible for my predecessor to make his intended restatement of policy in the House and it wasdecided to suspend action until after the election.2. In venturing again to raise this difficult matter with my colleagues I donot disagree in principle with the Cabinet decision, but I suggest that there isa better approach to the problem.3. In my view, the time has now come when the Postmaster-General should no longer assume the function of arbiter in disputes between rival staff associa-tions for official recognition. Post Office practice hitherto followed was appro-priate to a period of development during which the lines of staff representationwere being laid down. But this time is now past. The main lines of staffrepresentation have taken shape and the whole field is occupied. Thirty-threeunions covering the 330,000 employees are recognised. Existing unions (with oneor two minor exceptions) have enjoyed exclusive recognition for many years, andin this situation the admission of new associations should be a matter for staff associations themselves, which, in the Post Office, would be primarily the StaffSides of the two Departmental Whitley Councils. Any other course would be inprinciple an unreasonable interference by the employer in the affairs of the employees, and in practice would be liable to encourage the formation of break-away associations, disrupting organised relations between the management andthe staff.4. That is not to say that the Postmaster-General should disinterest himselfentirely in the matter. On the contrary, he must reserve the right of finaldecision. But, in the first place, it is to be hoped that existing staff associationswill make a broad minded approach to the matter and will show a due sense ofresponsibility. If, in practice, that hope should be disappointed, my course wouldbe to use all the resources at my disposal to influence them in the right direction,and, if that failed, to invite them to submit the matter to arbitration. In thelast resort, I should not hesitate myself to give a ruling I should, in fact, at that stage proceed to a decision based on the considerations already approved by theCabinet.38421B
5. A claim might be made that it is normal practice in industry to placeupon existing unions the responsibility for saying whether any new union shouldbe recognised. But this offers no real parallel with the Civil Service, since in industry any group, whether recognised or not, can in certain circumstances takematters in dispute (including wage claims) to arbitration, while in the CivilService the right is restricted to recognised associations. A real parallel is,however, provided by the industrial staffs in the Civil Service; both the admiralty and the Ministry of Supply, who are very large employers of industrial CivilServants, refer to the Trade Union side of the appropriate Industrial Council:any applications for recognition received from an unrecognised union. The course have outlined involves treating the Post Office staff in this matter on a different basis from non-industrial civil servants in other Government Departments. the distinction is, however, involved in the restatement of policy proposed in cp. (49)&apos; 241 (revise) and approved by the Cabinet, and is justified by the quasi-industrial character of the Post Office.6. The Staff Sides of the two Post Office Whitley Councils have not yet beensounded, as will of course be necessary, but there is ground to believe that theymay welcome a statement on the lines proposed and prefer it to the restatement ofpolicy previously approved (which they were prepared to accept, but with someshow of reluctance). It will also be necessary to consult the National Guild ofTelephonists, a recognised break-away association; this would be done a day or two before I made my statement in the House.7. The course previously decided on by the Cabinet deliberately providedfor a restatement as opposed to a change of policy, in order to preserve publicfaith. I am confident that the line now proposed does not invalidate the defencepreviously available against a charge of breach of faith. The advantages it offersare that it is constructive and that it provides a stronger position to maintain inthe House. I ask my colleagues to concur with the revised draft statement of policycontained in the appendix to this paper.8. The Treasury have been consulted and it is understood that the Chancellorof the Exchequer will indicate his views to the Cabinet.N.

REVISED DRAFT STATEMENT OF POLICY(1) I have now carefully reviewed the basis on which recognition by the PostOffice should be given to new staff associations.(2) My predecessor informed the Union of Post Office Workers in December,1946, that he saw no reason at that time for departing from the policy hithertopursued of considering a request for recognition from an association if it could show that it had in membership at least 40 per cent, of the organised staff of the grade or grades concerned. This statement seems to have been taken in certain quarters to mean that, if an association could show a membership of 40 per cent,of the organised staff of any particular grade or grades, it would automaticallyqualify for recognition in respect of that grade or grades. That is not the case,nor was it the intention of my predecessor when he made his statement conditional upon the prevailing circumstances on any given occasion being similar to thosethen obtaining.(3) In its letter of 27th August, 1949, to the Engineering Officers&apos; (Tele-communications) Association, the Post Office stated that further examinationwould be made of their membership figures, for consideration of recognition, onthe assumption that &apos;&apos; in the meantime there is no change in regard to theprinciple on which the grade is used as a basis for considering claims by staff associations to official recognition.&quot;(4) In considering how to deal with this problem to-day, I recognise that inthe past, during what I might call the formative stages of Trade Unionism, itwas essential for the Postmaster-General to take steps to safeguard the properconsideration of claims from new associations for recognition. Under present-day conditions, however, when the broad basis of Trade Unionism is fully estab-lished, I take the view that the question of recognising new associations is amatter to be settled in the first place by the existing staff organisations them-selves in the case of the Post Office, this would be primarily the Staff Sides ofthe Post Office Whitley Councils. I conceive my role to be not to intervene inany dispute between the staff associations or their members concerning recognitionunless and until I am satisfied that the existing associations have become quiteunrepresentative and that action is called for on my part to ensure that any dispute between contesting parties is equitably settled. I propose to apply thispolicy to outstanding claims for recognition from new associations in thePost Office.13th March, 1950.
