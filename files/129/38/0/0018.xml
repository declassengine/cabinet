Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1950SECRET ..... Copy No.February, 1950.CABINETTHE COLOMBO conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a summary of proceedings at the Commonwealth Meeting on Foreign Affairs at Colombo. the summary has been drawn up in consultation with the Commonwealth relations office.The purpose of the Colombo meeting was to enable the countries of theCommonwealth to exchange views on foreign affairs at the Ministerial level.This purpose was achieved; and, in addition, Ministers agreed to make certain recommendations to governments on economic development in South and South-East Asia, and on preliminary work to be undertaken in regard to a peace treaty with Japan. The Meeting at Colombo had however an added significance by virtue of the fact that it was the first of its kind to be held in Asia, and therecan be no doubt that it demonstrated to a heartening degree the extent of co-operation which can be developed between East and West through the agency ofthe Commonwealth. I consider that the results of the Meeting amply justifiedthe decision to hold it, and that the way has been paved for further meetings as occasion requires.There was a general realisation amongst Commonwealth Ministers thatworld problems are indivisible and that the problems of South and South-east asia are of particular urgency. There was also a remarkable unanimity of view as to the menace of Communism and as to the necessity of improving the standardof life and the social welfare of the peoples of South and South-East Asia inorder to combat this menace.The arrangements made by the Government of Ceylon for the accommodation,welfare and entertainment of visiting Commonwealth Delegations were whollyadmirable. The Government of Ceylon were generous in the extreme and through-out the Meeting were clearly anxious that Commonwealth Delegations should leave Ceylon with the best possible impression of their stay in the country. Theamount of entertainment offered was perhaps excessive, but was evidence of thegenera] goodwill towards visiting Delegations, which was heartily reciprocated.The Conference Secretariat, by arrangement, was provided jointly by theUnited Kingdom and Ceylon. This was a novel and interesting experiment; andit was gratifying to find that such a Joint Secretariat could work so smoothlyand efficiently. The United Kingdom High Commissioner and his staff were ofthe greatest assistance to the United Kingdom Delegation.Certain action remains to be taken on matters raised at Colombo, in particularwith regard to economic development in South-East Asia., to the Working Partyfor a Japanese Peace Treaty and to assistance to Burma. Separate memorandawill be circulated in due course on these subjects.E. B.3]Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1950.38323b
COMMONWEALTH MEETING ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  COLOMBOJANUARY 1950Summary of ProceedingsI. Genesis and Scope of the MeetingAt the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; meeting held in London in October1948 a suggestion was made that in the intervals between meetings of Common-wealth Prime Ministers occasional meetings on foreign affairs should be held ata Ministerial level. The Prime Minister of Ceylon invited commonwealth governments to hold the first of these meetings, which it was then thought wouldtake place in the first half of 1949, in Ceylon, and this invitation was generally welcomed. In the event, the holding of a special meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in April 1949 made it necessary to postpone the projected meeting onforeign affairs.2. In November 1949 Mr. Attlee sent a personal message to Mr. Senanayakesuggesting that the proposed meeting might be held in January 1950. At thesame time he suggested that each Commonwealth delegation should include oneor two senior economic officials who, in addition to advising their Ministers onsuch broad economic questions as might arise in the foreign affairs discussions,would be able to hold a series of meetings amongst themselves for the primary purpose of taking stock of the general balance of payments position of the sterling area as a whole. Mr. Senanayake adopted these suggestions in toto. In issuinghis invitations to other Commonwealth Prime Ministers he also proposed, on thebasis of suggestions made to him by the United Kingdom Government, that theagenda should include (1) a general review of the international situation, including economic aspects;(2) Japanese Peace Treaty;(3) China;(4) South-East Asia;(5) Europe.3. All Commonwealth Governments accepted the invitations and agreed tobe represented at a Ministerial level in the foreign affairs talks. In addition, theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia accepted an invitation to participate at theofficial level in the economic talks. Apart from myself, the United kingdom delegation consisted of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,Mr. Malcolm MacDonald (Commissioner-General for South-East Asia) andSir Walter Hankinson (United Kingdom High Commissioner in Ceylon). the leader of the United Kingdom team of officials for the economic&quot; talks wasSir Henry Wilson Smith (Treasury). Except in the case of South Africa and pakistan, all delegations were led by the Ministers responsible for foreign affairs.The Pakistan delegation was led by Mr. Ghulam Mohammed, Minister of Finance,in the unavoidable absence in New York of Sir Zaf rullah Khan. The Governmentof the Union of South Africa agreed to send a Minister only after a good dealof tactful pressure had been exerted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom. South Africa&apos;s initial unwillingness to participate at a ministerial level appeared to arise partly from genuine difficulties arising out of the factthat legislative sessions were on the point of beginning in Pretoria and partly from a reluctance to participate in a Commonwealth meeting in an Asian countryin which the Asian members were clearly destined to play an important role.II. Proceedings4. The Meeting began on the morning of 9th January and the final meeting was held on the morning of 14th January. The first formal act was to adopt a motion proposed by Pandit Nehru and seconded by me inviting the Prime Ministerof Ceylon to preside. The opening speeches were not entirely confined to the usualexchange of compliments, several delegates stressing the appropriateness of holding a Commonwealth meeting in Ceylon at a time when the emphasis of theworld situation seemed to be shifting from Europe to Asia, where some; of the
gravest international problems of the day were presenting themselves in their most acute form.5.  After the Meeting had agreed the times of meetings, Mr. Senanayakesuggested the following subjects for discussion: (1) General international situation (including current economic situation).(2) China.(3) Japanese Peace Treatv.(4) South-East Asia (incfuding particularly (i) Indo-China, (ii) financialassistance to Burma).(5) Europe.On the understanding that within these broad headings specific limited issuescould be raised, and that further subjects might be added with the agreementof Ministers, this agenda was approved.6. Publicity. The Meeting agreed that the Secretariat should be responsiblefor preparing a daily press communique, to be approved by Ministers before issue,regarding each day&apos;s discussions. In addition to the formal press communiquesa good deal of background information was communicated to the press by appro-priate officers of each delegation, who made themselves generally responsible for maintaining contact with the press of their own country. Considerable importance was attached to ensuring proper coverage of the Colombo meetings in the press ofthe United States and arrangements were made to treat American correspondentson the same footing as the representatives of the London press. By these regularinformal contacts interest in the Meeting, which might otherwise have flaggedbecause of the inevitable meagreness of the information contained in the officialcommuniques, was kept alive. Coverage of the Meeting both in the London press and in United States newspapers serviced by correspondents in Colombo was, onthe whole, excellent.7. Communication of information to the United States Government. Prior to the Meeting the United States Government had expressed a particulardesire to be kept informed of the substance of the discussions. The question ofthe communication of information to the United States Government was raised at the first meeting, but the discussion was inconclusive, and it was realised thatin the absence of a formal decision of the Meeting on the subject other arrange-ments would have to be made. I accordingly authorised His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington to communicate to the State Department in confidence the materialcontained in telegrams despatched by the United Kingdom delegation reporting the day-to-day proceedings. In addition, the United Kingdom delegation main-tained close contact with the United States Ambassador in Ceylon and kept himinformed of the discussions on the proposals for economic development in South-East Asia put forward by the Australian Minister for External Affairs(Mr. Spender). I also saw the United States Ambassador and gave him a personalaccount of some of the proceedings of the Meeting for the confidential informationof his Secretary of State (Mr. Acheson). In particular, the United states ambassador was informed of the result of the discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, and of the discussion I had had with Pandit Nehru and Mr. GhulamMohammed about the economic dispute between India and Pakistan, and he wasalso apprised of the hesitance of Commonwealth Governments to recognise Bao Daiuntil the French had ratified their agreement with him. In general, it is consideredthat adequate steps were taken to ensure that the United States Government were kept informed of the Colombo proceedings.8. General International Situation. The first substantive item on theagenda was a discussion of the general international situation. In my opening speech, I described how Russian designs to overrun Europe had been met by apolicy of Western consolidation and how, by this means, the West had now become strong enough to resist aggression. As a result, Russia had turned herattention to the East. There had been suggestions that the best way to meet thenew threat was by concluding a Pacific pact on the lines of the Atlantic pact.But the proponents of this view overlooked the various special circumstances inthe Eastern situation which made a formal pact inappropriate. The right policy was for like-minded countries with interests in the East to keep in close contactajid to be ready to help each other in resisting any attempt to hinder peacefuldevelopment on democratic lines.   I stressed the close interdependence of East38323 &apos; b 2
and West and the great need for the expansion of capital development and foodproduction in the less-developed countries, and said I hoped that a policy offinancial help without domination could be adopted towards these countries.9. In the ensuing discussion all speakers recognised the urgent need of taking some specific action to counter the expansionist policy of the Soviet UnionIt was generally agreed somewhat reluctantly by the New Zealand Minister(Mr. Doidge) and to a lesser extent by Mr. Spender-that a formal military ordefence pact was inappropriate, at any rate at this stage, and that the most pressing problem was that of devising means to raise economic standards incertain Asian countries. The urgency and importance of action on these lineswas recognised by all Commonwealth Ministers, and the discussion of the practicaleconomic steps that might be taken to help the threatened areas of Asia to resistCommunist encroachments proved to be one of the major tasks of the Conference.The subject was discussed again at a number of subsequent meetings. A detailedaccount of the nature and the results of these discussions is contained in para-graphs 21 to 26 below.10. China. The discussion on the recognition of the new communist government of China was opened by Mr. Spender who expressed regret thatcertain Commonwealth Governments had not been able to postpone recognitionin order to give time for the subject to be discussed at Colombo and complained of lack of consultation. Mr. Doidge, who followed him, echoed these mildreproaches. In reply I pointed out that there had been full and continuousconsultation with the Commonwealth on the subject for several months past,and in the light of the understanding which Mr. Acheson had shown of theUnited Kingdom position in the course of the conversations which we had heldin September, I decried suggestions that recognition on the part of the UnitedKingdom might lead to friction with the United States. Pandit Nehru followedwith a lucid exposition of the reasons which had led India to recognise theChinese Communist Government before all other Commonwealth Governments,No speaker showed any disposition to question the fundamental correctness ofthe decision to accord de jure recognition to the Chinese Communist Governmentand all Commonwealth countries who had not recognised agreed that recognitionsooner or later was inevitable. It Avas generally agreed that there had, in fact,been ample consultation in advance of the United Kingdom Governments act of recognition. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations pointedout that as far as the United States was concerned Mr. Acheson had expressedthe hope that the Commonwealth would not take concerted action.11. Pandit Nehru, who opened the ensuing discussion about future events in China, considered that the Communists had succeeded firstly because of hostility to what was regarded as foreign interference by the Americans and secondlybecause they gave at any rate an appearance of liberating the country. In South-East Asia, too, they might be regarded as a liberating and economic rather than as a military force, and we must do something to counter this. He thought that india&apos;s attitude towards the new China should be to show firmness in anythingaffecting her security, but otherwise to be cautiously friendly. Pandit Nehruwent on to say that foreign influence (which he subsequently corrected to foreigndomination) in South-East Asia was comparable to American interference inChina and might have the same consequences. He referred in particular to theFrench in Indo-China and made a heated allusion to their behaviour over theFrench possessions in India. When I enquired whether Pandit Nehru wanted to exclude the West from the East, he was at pains to explain that he did not mean that the West should go from Asia; on the contrary, he valued Westernco-operation. All that he meant was that Western attempts to dominate by force must cease.12. I followed Pandit Nehru and observed that it was too early to say howthings would develop in China and that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom intended to proceed carefully. We had no illusions, and would not be surprised if the Chinese Communists were to develop along the familiar patternin Eastern Europe. For our part we did not intend to antagonise communist china and would trade and maintain contacts with it as far as we were; able.13. Apart from the discussions of the specific item of China on the agenda,the question of the far-reaching consequences of the communisation of Chinainevitably proved a recurrent theme throughout the Meeting.   There can be
n0 doubt that, as a result of these discussions, Commonwealth Governmentsffill have acquired an increased awareness of the magnitude of the problem and0f the need to proceed cautiously and in consultation if the grave dangers inherent in the situation are to be avoided.14.   Japanese Peace Treaty. In order to provide a concrete basis for thediscussions on the Japanese Peace Treaty, Parts 1 to 4 of the brief annexed toS.A.C. (49) 18 were circulated to the Meeting as a paper by the United kingdom delegation.   I opened the discussion on this subject by giving a brief accountof previous efforts to convene a Peace Conference and went on to refer to my talks with the United States Administration last September, which indicated thattheir minds were now moving in a direction likely to lead to practical results.I emphasised that if the Meeting could reach broad agreement on the need for anew approach of the kind suggested in the United Kingdom paper, it might help the United States to reconcile their own internal differences.   The subsequentdiscussion made it clear that all Commonwealth Governments were in accord onthe extreme importance of the early conclusion of a final settlement with Japan.There was inevitably some difference in approach and emphasis as to the content of the settlement.  As expected, the Australian and New Zealand representativesemphasised the continuing danger of the resurgence of Japan&apos;s military strength,against which precautions must be taken.   Most other Commonwealth countriesagreed with the view (attributed to the United States in the United Kingdompaper) that the real threat now lies in the possibility of some form of association between Japan and the Communist Powers and that a major objective of thesettlement must be to ensure that Japan remains outside the Soviet bloc.   India,Pakistan and Ceylon all stressed the importance of imposing the minimum of restrictions on Japan, since a restrictive settlement might in the long run resultin the Japanese people pursuing the very courses which we were anxious thatthey should avoid.   Though most speakers were aware of the disadvantages of negotiating a Treaty of Peace without the participation of the Soviet union and China, there was general agreement that these disadvantages would be out-weighed by the benefits which would accrue from a final settlement.   As thediscussions revealed certain differences of emphasis in the degree of the menace to security presented by the possibility of the resurgence of Japan&apos;s military strength, I urged the importance of reconciling existing divergences of opinion and suggested that further discussions on the subject should be held with a viewto an eventual approach to the United States.   I particularly stressed theunwisdom of going into an international meeting as long as there remainedimportant differences of opinion among the members of the Commonwealth.  Thisview found general favour and Mr. Spender suggested that the discussions shouldbe continued in London by a working party of officials under the general super-vision, as regards Commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom of high Commissioners.   This proposal was approved by the Meeting.15. South-East Asia (see also paragraphs 21 to 26 below). Pandit Nehru,in opening the discussion on South-East Asia, said that the two principal objec-tives were the complete removal of foreign domination from all the countries inthe region, and the solution of its important and pressing economic problems.To be successful a policy for South-East Asia must satisfy both the nationalurge for freedom from foreign domination and the social urge for the bettermentof the economic conditions of the people. With particular reference to Indo-China, he did not see how any solution of the problem could be found as long asFrench armies were operating on Indo-Chinese soil.16. The Commissioner-General for South-East Asia (Mr. Malcolm Macdonald) described the nature of the threat to South-East Asia arising fromthe establishment of a Communist Government in China. He agreed with pandit nehru that the ideals inspiring the peoples of South-East Asia were politicalfreedom and economic betterment. If the democratic Powers were to succeedln containing the Communist advance, they must make it clear that they too were^ixious to enable the people to attain these objectives. The most important areasin which a political solution had not yet been found were Indo-China and Malaya.*Ir. MacDonald gave an account of the special problems of Malaya. The subjectof Indo-China was given separate and detailed consideration., 17. Indo-China. Mr. MacDonald&apos;s account of the position in Indo-China,based on his recent visit, clearly made a considerable impression on the Meeting.38323 b 3
He considered that Bao Dai personally was worthy of support and was a sincerepatriot and by no means merely a tool of the French. The military situation had turned in his favour and he was now largely dependent on his own local levies incertain areas where most of the French troops had been withdrawn. There couldbe no doubt that the French were sincere in their desire to complete the transferof power to Bao Dai at the earliest possible date. After I had announced theintention of the United Kingdom Government to accord de facto recognition toBao Dai&apos;s Government when the Agreement of 8th March had been ratifiedPandit Nehru expressed doubts as to the strength of Bao Dai&apos;s following and the degree of independence to be accorded to him. He considered that no definiteaction should be taken at this stage. I intervened to emphasise that by recognisingBao Dai we should be helping to bring peace and stability to Indo-China and Ithink that most Commonwealth Governments were convinced that the Bao Dairegime provided the only real practical alternative to Communism, though theywere unhappy about the situation in Indo-China and tended to voice some criticism of the French. The conclusion of the Meeting was that the Delegationswould report to their Governments the exchange of views which had taken place and that all Commonwealth Governments would continue to keep in touch with one another on this question without prejudice to the right of each Common-wealth Government to take its own decisions. Although Pandit Nehru wasin no way disposed to alter his attitude and continued to retain his suspicions ofFrench intentions in Indo-China, his acceptance of the conclusion showed that hewas reconciled to the early de facto recognition of Bao Dai by most Common-wealth Governments.18. Financial Assistance to Burma. There was general recognition by themeeting that Burma is among the more vulnerable of the areas threatened by theCommunist advance and is in immediate need of special assistance. I announcedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were willing to join withother Commonwealth Governments in making a loan of  7-^ million to the Govern-ment of Burma. Towards this total sum the United Kingdom Government wereprepared to make a contribution of  3f million which was intended to be a&quot; ways and means loan.&quot; The representatives of Ceylon, India and Pakistansaid that they would recommend to their Governments that they should contributethe sums of  250,000,  1 million and  500,000 respectively. The previousAustralian Government had declined to take part in Commonwealth aid to Burma.Mr. Spender&apos;s offer to recommend to his Government a contribution of  500,000was in refreshing contrast to his previous attitude, and may well foreshadowa more practical and forthcoming degree of co-operation on the part of Australia.The South African representative regretted that his Government would not beable to contribute. The New Zealand and Canadian representatives undertook to inform their Governments of the matter but could hold out no expectations ofa contribution.19. I referred also to the proposal that the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, India, Pakistan and Ceylon should offer a loan of  3 million to theGovernment of Burma to provide them with finance for the purchase of the exportsurplus of rice. The proposal was that this sum should be shared between thefour Governments according to the amount of rice that each intended to take from burma. The representatives of India and Ceylon both indicated that their governments would be prepared to make their proportionate contribution andMr. Ghulam Mohammed said that the Government of Pakistan would give theproposal early and sympathetic consideration.20. Europe. I gave a general review of the situation in Europe, withparticular reference to the steps which had been taken to resist the menace of soviet imperialism. Summing up, I said that the changes in the world situationcaused by two world wars had made it necessary for the United Kingdom tostrengthen her links with Europe; but in doing so she was anxious to ensure thather association with the rest of the Commonwealth should not be undermined.In any case, the United Kingdom Government would resist ill-considered plans for the integration of the United Kingdom economy with that of other european countries. In the ensuing discussion various delegates paid a tribute to theunflagging efforts made by the United Kingdom Government to stem Communistencroachments in Europe. . Commonwealth Ministers as a whole showed a sympathetic understanding of the special position of the United Kingdom as botha European and a world Power.
21. Economic Development in South and South-East - Asia. As stated inparagraph 9 above, discussion at the first session of the Meeting on the generalsituation soon turned to the practical action which could be taken by Common-wealth countries to meet the menace of Communism by economic action, moreparticularly in the South and South-East Asian area. There was general agree-ment that Communism must be combated and a demand was made for guidance and decision as to the action which should be taken. The Australian representa-tjye, after stressing the interest of Australia in the stability of South-East Asia,with particular reference to Indonesia, asked whether a plan could,not be evolvedto satisfy this need and to assist countries&apos;in South-East Asia in a practical way,by the provision of food, capital equipment and technical assistance. more information about, the. needs of the area was required. This proposal was supported by the Ceylonese representative. The Pakistani representativeresponded to Mr. Spender&apos;s request and gave an account of Pakistani needs for development. The discussion was adjourned at this point to give an opportunityfor the formulation of specific proposals.22. It was ascertained that the Australian Delegation had certain concreteideas on this matter and Sir Percivale Liesching and Sir Roger Makins were instructed to find out whether Mr. Spender would be prepared to take the initiative in tabling proposals before the Meeting. He readily agreed to do this and a draftAustralian paper was submitted for comment to the United Kingdom Delegation.Observations were made but no attempt was made to table a joint proposal orto put any pressure on the Australians.23.   While the Australian paper was in preparation, the Ceylonese finance minister put forward a proposal for a ten-year plan for the development of the under-developed countries in South-East Asia which should include arrangementsfor guaranteeing commodity prices and markets.  This proposal was subsequentlyextended to include a suggestion for the establishment of an O.E.E.C. for South-East Asia.  When the Australian paper and the Ceylonese paper were considered together in connexion with the discussion of South-East Asia on 12th January,a joint resolution for adoption by the Meeting was circulated by the Australian,New Zealand and Ceylonese Delegations.    This resolution suggested certaincourses of action, which should be recommended to Governments, for contributing to the economic development of the area and also the proposed establishment ofa Consultative Committee in Australia to work- out and apply these proposals.In the discussion of this resolution it was clear that the general approach com-manded the unanimous support of the Meeting, though the Indian attitude to theproposal for a .Committee was somewhat cautious.   I entered a caveat howeveron two major points.   The first was that the United Kingdom had already madea very substantial contribution to the area since 1945 (I mentioned an inclusivefigure of  750 million) and could not be expected to give much, if any, further assistance except possibly in respect of Malaya and North Borneo.   Secondly, Idrew attention to the danger of trying to fix a specific priority for one region of&quot; ) world.  The United Kingdom and the international organisations from whichresources might be found to assist the development of the area were bound totake account of the competing claims of other parts of the world on the available&apos;resources.24. At the conclusion of this discussion the Meeting agreed in principle to make recommendations to governments about the need of promoting economic development for South-East Asia on the lines of the resolution submitted by theAustralian, New Zealand and Ceylonese Delegates, and instructed the economicadvisers attached to the Delegations to consider in detail the phrasing of these recommendations and to report their conclusions on the following day. Theeconomic advisers, who met on 14th January under the chairmanship of Sir[Roger Makins, had little difficulty in reaching agreed recommendations exceptone point, namely whether there should be a reference to support of the claimspi South-East Asia in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-nnt. Some doubt was expressed whether the effect of such a paragraph on thepther members and staff of the Internationa! Bank might not be such as to defeat,fosome extent, the object of the proposal, which was to secure a greater measurer support for the area from the International Bank in the future than in thepast. However, Ministers, after discussion, decided to maintain the referencer tfle Bank which appears as paragraph A (ii) in the recommendation topvernments.   Subject to this point and to one change introduced to meet the
views of the Canadian and United Kingdom Delegations, the recommendationsprepared by the officials were adopted by the Conference on 13th January. Asa matter of procedure it was agreed that a reasonable interval should be allowedto elapse to enable governments represented at the Meeting to consider the terrasof the resolution. The Australian Government should then enquire whether other commonwealth Governments accepted the recommendations and were preparedto hold the first meeting of the proposed Consultative Committee in Canberra.The text of the final recommendations is attached at Annex A.25. It will be noted that, while the action of the proposed consultative committee is not circumscribed by its terms of reference, no commitment hasbeen taken by governments as to the contributions which they will make. TheCommittee is to consider any proposals for the economic development of the area.The idea of mutual assistance within the area was specifically introduced intothe recommendation with an eye to United States opinion. As regards the consultative Committee itself, it is asked to approach the other governmentsinterested in the area with a view to enlisting their co-operation and to workin with the Asian, international and regional organisations concerned with theobject of raising the level of production and the standard of living in the area.This last proposal had particularly in view the Economic Commission forAsia and the Far East (E.C.A.F.E.) and it was thought that sometechnical and other assistance might be available through that agency. the membership of the Committee would initially be confined to commonwealth countries and a loophole would be left to enable Canada and South Africa to abstain from membership of the Committee without embarrassment to themselvesor to the rest of the Commonwealth. In fact they are likely to do so at the outset.The eventual participation of non-Commonwealth countries is not excluded.26. Some exaggerated claims were put forward at Colombo as regards thescope of this proposal, which was widely written up as the only concrete achieve-ment of the Meeting. There were also conflicting claims by Ceylon and australia to the credit for putting forward the proposal. More soberly considered, theproposal holds out the promise of useful activity, and might help to enlist UnitedStates assistance in the area. It was also satisfactory to find that the australian government were ready to take the initiative in the action on this question since,in view of the strict limitations on any additional contribution which the UnitedKingdom could make in present circumstances, it would have been difficult forthe United Kingdom Delegation to take the lead in pressing the proposal.27. &quot; Other action arising out of the Meeting. At Annex B is a note of thevarious points (other than those dealt with in paragraphs 21 to 26 above) onwhich action is required as a result of the Meeting.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1950.
. . , :  ANNEX ARecommendations on Economic Policy in South and South-East AsiaA. The Conference of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers recommends thatthe participating Governments should : (i) examine the possibility of making financial assistance available for essential productive purposes in South and South-East Asia, taking into account their existing commitments;(ii) support as high a priority as possible for projects presented to theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development which would contribute to the economic well-being of the area and would be inaccordance with the Bank&apos;s objectives;(iii) contribute to the technical assistance work of the United Nations andits Specialised Agencies, and to support in these organisations as higha priority as possible for the needs of South and South-East Asia;(iv) examine the possibility of making supplementary bilateral arrangements in appropriate cases for the provision of direct technical and other assistance;(v) generally, consider proposals for the economic development of the area,keeping in view the possibilities of mutual assistance.B. With a view to the implementation of these recommendations theConference further recommends the establishment of a Consultative Committee,membership of which will be open to all Commonwealth Governments which wishto participate, with the following terms of reference : (i) to receive from Governments an indication of the action which theyconsider it feasible to take in response to the recommendations inSection A;(ii) to approach the Governments of countries outside the Commonwealthinterested in the.area with a view to enlisting their collaboration;(iii) to examine the methods of co-ordinating development activities inSouth and South-East Asia, in association with international and regional organisations concerned with the object of raising the levelof production and the standard of living in the area;(iv) to examine the desirability of promoting international commodity agreements for basic products, which would benefit the area and couldbe recommended for consideration under the Havana Charter;(v) to consider whether the economic development of under-developed countries of the area would be assisted by the drawing up of aco-ordinated plan of development and by the establishment of special machinery;(vi) to make recommendations to Governments.C. If these recommendations are accepted the Australian Governmentwould be pleased to accept the responsibility of convening the first meeting of the consultative Committee in Australia.
ANNEX BOther Action arising out of the MeetingAlthough the only recommendations to Governments formally adopted bythe Meeting were those relating to economic development in South-East Asiaset out in Annex A, it may be convenient to summarise the remaining actionwhich will arise out of the Meeting : (a) Japanese Peace Treaty.A working party of Commonwealth High Commissioners and officials is tobe set up in London with a view to reconciling any remaining substantialdifferences of opinion between Commonwealth Governments as to the form and content of the Japanese Peace Treaty.-(b) Financial A assistance to Burma.(i) The Delegations of Ceylon, India, Pakistan and Australia are to recom-mend to their Governments that they should contribute the sums of  250,000, 1,000,000,  500,000 and  500,000 respectively to a loan to the Government of burma. The United Kingdom contribution is to be  3f million. The NewZealand and Canadian Delegations, although they could hold out no expectation of a contribution, undertook to inform their Governments fully of the matter.(ii) The Government of Pakistan are to give early and sympathetic con-sideration to a proposal that they should contribute to a loan of  3 million to be offered to the Government of Burma to provide them with finance for the purchaseof the export surplus of rice, this sum to be shared between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan and Ceylon according to the amountof rice that each intends to take from Burma. The Delegations of India and ceylon indicated that their Governments would be prepared to make theirproportionate contribution.(c) Indo-China.It was agreed that Commonwealth Governments would continue to maintainclose contact on the question of the recognition of Bao Dai, without prejudice tothe right of each Commonwealth Government to take its own decisions.
