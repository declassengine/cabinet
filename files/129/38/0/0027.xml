(50)  27 COPY NO.3RD march, 1950CABINETBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE:  CHIEPTAINSHIPOP THE 3AMANGWAT0 TRIBEMemorandum by the Secretary of State forComrnony/ealth Relat 1 ons ..;1In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision of thismorning (C. M. (50) 7th Conclusions, Minute 1), the Lord privy seal and I saw Seretse Khama this afternoon.      As expected,and despite all the arguments which we could bring to bear on him, he adhered to the view that he could not voluntarilyabdicate without consultation with his tribe,      He has agreednot to leave London until after a further discussion which I said I hoped to be able to have with him by Wednesday next.2. I now ask for authority to inform Seretse that aftervery careful consideration of all the circumstances the Govern-ment have decided that they must withhold recognition of hissuccession to the chieftainship for a period of years duringwhich the system of direct rule which will have to be intro-duced will be progressively modified and steps taken to associatethe tribe with the administration;    that it is not possible tostate how long this period will be, but that in the vie?/ of theGovernment it will certainly not be less than five years.3. I am convinced that it will be essential, when wecome to make a public statement, to give a sufficiently clear indication of the period during which the question of recog-nition will not be reconsidered.      Without this the HighCommissioner would have to cope with the intensification offaction feeling, probably leading to unrest and disorder.Moreover, the tribe would not be able to settle down under thenew interim conditions,  and in particular the High Commissionerstates definitely that the leading men of the tribe would be unwilling to come forward to share in the administration.Furthermore, we might well bo in difficulties ourselves throughcontinuous pressure to end the period of non-recognition.h. I would then endeavour to persuade Seretse to sendfor his wife, promising that she would be carefully providedfor on the journey and that an allowance,  and other forms of help, would be given to them in London.      The continuance ofthe allowance would be dependent  on his not  returning to the protectorate except by permission of the Government.      If herefuses, and says that he must return to the Protectorate tobring his wife away,  I desire authority to arrange for him togo to Lobatsi (which is in the Protectorate but outside the bamangwato Reserve) on the understanding that his stay therewould be only temporary and that they would both be requiredto leave the Protectorate at the earliest time consistent withhis wif e &apos; s health.

1245. The question of the date for making public our decision is a further difficulty.      On the one hand, we should avoid any unnecessary delay, with the risks of leakage andlocal agitation.      On the other hand, the public announcementwill require to be made simultaneously here and in the bamangwato Reserve, and for the latter purpose the HighCommissioner will require a week1 a notice to assemble thetribal Kgotla from outlying districts.      The High Commissionerhas heavy responsibilities at a difficult time for the preven-tion of disorder and his advice is entitled to great respect.6. I therefore ask for authority to make a statement in the House on Monday, -13th March.      The terms of the state-men t cannot be finally settled unt-il after my next meeting with Seretse, and I suggest that before settling the statement with the Prime Minister, I should consult the Lord Privy Seal,the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Attorney-General.      I would impress on Seretse the&apos; importance of notdisclosing the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government before thepublic announcement.      In the statement in the House I would propose to say that a White Paper will be laid.P. C. G. -W.Commonwealth Relations OfficeS. W. 13RD MARCH,  1950.-2-
