Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1950CONFIDENTIALCP. (50) 15flth January, 1950CABINETRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVILIAN LIFE AND LIFE IN the armed FORCESProposed Advisory council memorandum by Minister of Labour and National service at their meeting on 7th May, 1948 (L.P. (48) 8th Meeting, Minute 1), theLord Presidents Committee approved the recommendations made by an Inter-Departmental Committee for the settlement in civilian employment of ex-regularmembers of the Armed Forces, and I have recently submitted to the StandingCommittee of Service Ministers a report, Annex B, on the progress made and thelines for further development.2. The resettlement in civilian employment of a regular service man on leaving the Forces is, however, only one part, albeit a most important part, ofthe general problem of securing a close and proper integration between service in the Armed Forces and civilian working life. At present the man whovolunteers to join the Armed Forces tends to be regarded by those he leaves as having chosen a career which cuts him off from ordinary industrial and commercial life. When he comes back after a short or long period of regularservice he is an outsider who has to edge himself back in. If the Forces we needare to be kept up to strength by voluntary means, this must be changed. service in the Forces must be regarded as one part of a normal and continuous career.3. It was clear from the proceedings of the Conference &quot;Ariel&quot; stagedby the R.A.F. in May last, that the Government, Industry (both employers andtrade unionists) and Educational interests were alive to this. They were interested and readjr to recognise that there was something to be done for which each of them had a share of responsibility. It was clear, too, that they had much to learn from one another on the subject. I propose, therefore, in agree-ment with the Minister of Defence, to establish an Advisory Council, withrepresentatives of both sides of industry and of education, whose purpose wouldfie to advise the Government on action which it could take, but also, and veryunportant, to maintain and develop the interest already aroused in industry and educational circles and pave the way to specific action by the responsible bodies1]i their respective spheres.4. My detailed proposals for the constitution of the Committee, which havePeen the subject of inter-departmental discussion and agreement, are set out to Annex A.5.   I seek the approval of my colleagues to the formation of this Council.ij G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,27th January, 1950.Copy No.3138192B

In July the Defence Ministers had before them a Paper by the Secretaryof State for War drawing attention to the importance of this scheme in its bearing on recruitment for the Regular Forces, and urging a more speedy implementation of the recommendations of the Wiles Committee Report-in particular the import-ance of &quot; guaranteed numbers of vacancies &quot; in the nationalised industries was stressed. Since that Paper was before my colleagues, interdepartmental discus-sions have taken place at the official level so as to ensure that the aim is realisedof providing the opportunity for a man to have a continuous career in and outof the Service, in such a way that the civil employment be can obtain is appropriate to his age, experience and ability. In particular a Committee of the Principa&apos;Pefspnttw Officers of the Service Departments and representatives of the Ministryof Defence and Education Departments has been set up under the chairmanship of the: Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour to ensure that theMachinery for bringing about a closer integration of Service and civil life is tberight,, machinery, to review from time to time the progress made, and to stimulateaction as and where necessary. I think that the formation of this Committeeand other administrative arrangements proposed by it should secure the necessaryprogress.
2. It may be convenient now to summarise the action taken to implement thevarious recommendations contained in the Report and to discuss briefly somequestions of policy which have arisen in the course of it. The recommendations,summarised in paragraph 22 of the Wiles Report, were as follows :-(i) Post-Service Resettlement Training(a) The provision of vocational training for skilled trades in industry for men who did not possess that skill but were capable of gain-ing it by an intensive course.-This has been carried out so fax throughthe general scheme of vocational training run by the Ministry of Labour.Since the end of the war this has provided training in about 150 tradesat Government Training Centres, in Technical Colleges or in Employers&apos;Establishments. Statistics of men in training have not been keptseparately for ex-Regulars as distinguished from ex-Service men, but arrangements to do this for future entrants are being made. It is theintention that this scheme shall continue, and ex-Regulars will be coveredby it. In addition, however, the provision by industry of training courses specifically designed for ex-Regulars has been taken up in the approach to individual industries which is discussed later.(6) A scheme for professional and University training for a fewshort service officers and men. This scheme has not been put into forcebecause the Service Departments, on whom the Treasury decided the cost should fall, have not felt able to pay.A Committee of Principal Personnel Officers on Resettlement of ex-Regulars considered this matter further at its meeting on28th November, 1949, and was disturbed that no progress had been made.It considered that such a scheme should not be regarded as a luxury, that failure to put it into effect would impair recruitment, and that it wastherefore important that the recommendations should be implemented.(c) A business training scheme primarily for men over 42.- Thiswas started in April 1949. By August 1949,144 ex-Regulars had startedtraining.(d) The Ministry of Labour should accept responsibility for runningthese schemes. Except in the case of ,(&amp;) the Ministry of Labour has undertaken these responsibilities, in consultation with the Ministry ofEducation and the Service Departments.(ii) Resettlement A dvice and Training during ServiceNo recommendation was made under this head but the Committeewelcomed the declared policy of the Service Departments to make up-to-date and accurate resettlement advice freely available to members of theforces, and to provide facilities for spare-time resettlement education tothe maximum practical extent.In all three Services up-to-date and comprehensive information onresettlement, from Ministry of Labour and other sources, is provided inunits, which receive the Services Resettlement Bulletin, edited by a boardof representatives of all three Services and published monthly by the institute of Army Education.In addition, arrangements in the three Services are as follows v Royal Navy. Whole-time courses to fit men for the civil occu-pation of their choice are provided for pensioners nearing the end oftheir engagements, and for other ratings on regular engagements ifthey can be spared. Up-to-date information on resettlement matters such as training schemes and opportunities for employment is avail-able to any officer or man who desires it.Army. All.regulars with more than three years&apos; service havean annual interview with unit educational staffs, with a final inter-view during the last six months before discharge. At these inter-views guidance is given on the choice of civil occupation, and personnel are advised on the sort of studies they should pursueduring the remainder of their service. Whenever possible, an officerof the Ministry of Labour is present at the final interview.38192 b 2
Facilities for study are afforded by classes in units, at ArmyEducation Centres and Army Colleges and, where practicable, by classesconducted by Local Education Authorities. Opportunities for privatestudy are also provided by the Forces Correspondence Course Scheme:1A limited amount of trade training is given at Army College (North)at Welbeck Abbey under local arrangements in technical units, and underthe auspices of Local Education Authorities.R.A.F. Every airman is interviewed by the Station EducationOfficer eighteen months before the end of his engagement, to enable-\ .&quot;       the latter to judge what help the man may need to prepare him forhis future occupation&quot; and, where possible, to provide this helpduring the remainder of the man&apos;s service.Where the numbers requiring instruction in any subject are sufficient, classes are held in units, though most of the instruction isprovided on an individual basis in local educational institutions.Preparation for professional and semi-professional examinations iscarried out to the prescribed syllabuses of professional bodies, and manycandidates are prepared for such examinations as the Intermediate and final B.Sc. of London University, and the examinations of the CivilService and the technical institutions. Assistance for those wishing totake up industrial occupations takes the form of instruction in the back-ground subjects which will be useful in the chosen trade, or of preparation for post-Service training courses.(iii) Recognition of Service Trade Qualifications by Trade UnionsThe Inter-Services Committee should continue Us work. TheCommittee has now reviewed the whole of the Service Trades, and hasconcluded that in approximately half of them recognition is not a pre-requisite of employment. The majority of the remaining trades havebeen recognised by the Trade Unions as fully skilled for industry.Negotiations with the Trade Unions are still proceeding, and it isexpected that arrangements for the remaining trades in which recognitionis necessary for employment will shortly be satisfactorily concluded.The total number of Regulars serving the Trades which1 had been recognised up to the end of November 1949 is approximately 54,000.Enquiries made throughout Great Britain have shown that ex-Regularswhose skilled trade has been recognised encounter little difficulty inobtaining work at the trade.(iv) Employment of Ex-Regulars in the Home Civil service the Treasury proposals should be agreed. They have been agreed and implemented as follows : Departmentally recruited classes providing posts of a minorcharacter. These were expected to provide about 7,000 posts annually.Detailed statistics of such placings are not available, but fairly compre-hensive figures are maintained by the National Association. These showthat 10,500 placihgs of ex-Regulars were effected in such jobs in 1948-:     Of these, 3,700 were placings as postmen-.Administrative Class. An age allowance is made and the educa-tional requirements modified. No ex-Regular was successful in 1948or 1949.Executive Class. -A special examination for ex-Regulars is held-It was anticipated that this would guarantee 40-60 posts per annum for ex-Regulars. In 1949 37 ex-Regulars were assigned. 160 vacancieswere offered in the competition held at the end of 1949 and it is hoped- that assignments in 195.0, which will be from this competition, will be substantially above those of 1949.Clerical Class.:-A special examination is held ass above.   The-    expectation was that 400-500 posts would be filled annually. In 1949 229ex-Regulars were assigned. 650 vacancies were offered in the competitionheld at the end of 1949 and it is hoped that assignments during 1950,-   which will be from this competition, will be of the order of 600.
Professional, scientific and technical grades. An age allowance&quot;    was to be made, and the experience gained in the Services to be regarded- :  as far as possible as equal to that in civilian life!     This has been implemented.(v) Foreign Service    &apos;Similar arrangements should apply as for the Home Service. these have been implemented. The numbers of candidates successful were fiveand six for the Executive and Clerical Classes respectively. In additionone ex-Regular obtained appointment in Branch A through the recon-struction competition during 1949.(vi) Colonial ServiceNo recommendation was made, but current arrangements providefor the Colonial Office to notify the three Service Departments of vacancies for which there might be technically qualified regulars.(vii) Local Government service the Ministry of Health and Scottish Department should approach&apos; the Local Government Associations and draw to their attention thearrangements being made by Central Government for a quota of vacancies.These Associations have been approached.   The National Joint: ,; Council for Local Authority Administrative, Professional, technical and Clerical Services is considering a special entrance examination andmodified form of promotions examination and the linking of these arrangements with suitable schemes of training in the Services.The two other National Joint Councils, i.e., for Manual workers and for County Council Roadmen, have accepted the general principlefavouring the resettlement of ex-Regulars.   Detailed application of the&apos;i k principle has still to be worked out.  The L.C.C. have provided for ageallowances for administrative and clerical grades, and an; educationali. h. concession for the administrative grade.   It already gives a preference-2c,o to ex-Servicemen when filling posts in the minor grades.  Provision forother grades is being considered.(viii) Police Services   . .      - ,.&apos;An age concession from 30-31 was recommended, and has beenv arranged.   This will enable those who join the Forces as boys, particular-larly the R.N. and whose engagement is for 12 years from age 18, tohave an opportunity to join the Police after leaving the Forces.&apos;(ix) Fire ServicesConsideration of a concrete scheme was to be deferred for about&apos;.V. &quot;. a year.   The Fire Services Advisory Council has been approached to-consider age and other concessions.(x) B.B.C.Agreement had been reached for 50 per cent, of the vacancies for skilled and unskilled manual  workers  to  carry  a preference  forex-Regulars, Other things being equal.   Suitably qualified ex-Regularsuc-U -&apos;6f -all ranks would also be considered for specialised vacancies.   These* arrangements are; in operation.   The B.B.C. have promised a report onthe results of the first year&apos;s working which is just completed. .(xi) Industry &apos; -  &apos; ,-y -: ....... ;-v ,y. .v-.-i,   . :    (a) An approach was to be made,to the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil for approval in principle of the scheme for resettlement and force; the setting up of machinery. Approval was obtained on 28th July,, 1948,o.;    and the machinery proposed was an approach to the appropriate organi-&apos; sations, i.ei, the Joint bodies or the two Sides of individual industries!:   . (b) Consultation with individual industries would probably bev. ; necessary.   This consultation has taken place so far with 9 industries(not counting the nationalised industries).&apos; &apos;38192^;&apos;-:^ vrrv; ^&apos;&apos;hf^W^^h-p)0. b3;
(cj A separate approach&apos; should be made to the nationalised indus-: tries by the Ministry of Labour.   This has been done and detailed negotiations are in progress.(xii) National Association for Employment of ex-RegularsContinued recognition and close co-operation were recommended.This has been done.(xiii) Further action the Ministry of Labour should be responsible for further action,and an Inter-departmental Committee set up. This has been done and!as stated in the first paragraph, the administrative arrangements havebeen strengthened.General comment the Problem of the ex-Officer-3. Throughout the negotiations with nationalised and private industry,the need for finding suitable openings for the ex-regular of Appointments Depart-ment type has been kept well in mind. Owing to the increased cost of living and hightaxation, the great majority of ex-officers now find it necessary to secure employ-ment, whereas, before the war, many of them were able to retire on their pensions.Moreover as marriages of members of the regular Forces under the age of 25are not recognised, many officers retire about the aged of 45 or 50 at the time whenthey are faced with the heaviest expenditure on their children&apos;s education. Fromthe recruiting standpoint, it is very important that suitable openings should befound for ex-officers on retirement, as parents are otherwise likely to do their best to dissuade young men from aiming at commissions in the Forces.4. The problem is, however, one of very special difficulty, especially inrelation to the ex-officer seeking civilian employment for the first time at the ageof 45 or 50. The general shortage of man-power, which was mentioned in theWiles Committee Report as a factor which might assist resettlement, does notapply to the ex-officer, who will generally be seeking a post of managerial, execu-tive or administrative type. There are more persons seeking employment of thiskind than there are vacancies available. The jobs available, moreover, will-often be outside daily travelling distance from many of the places in which ex-officers have been accustomed to settle down. Finally, the problem of the older ex-officersforms part of the larger problem of finding openings of managerial, executive or administrative type for persons in the older age-groups.5. In spite of these difficulties, the Ministry&apos;s efforts to assist ex-regular officers to find suitable employment have not been without success. During theyear ended 10th October, 1949, the Appointments Offices placed 642 ex-regular officers in posts, not necessarily highly paid at the outset, of managerial, executiveor administrative type, and in addition 207 were placed in vacancies of the kinddealt with by Exchanges. The number of unemployed ex-officers on the Appoint-ments Register fell from 2,280 on 11th October, 1948, to 1,594 on 10th October.\ 1949, . ., -      ,r\;.;       .&quot; &apos; . ;6. The curtailment of Government expenditure will increase the difficultyof finding suitable openings for ex-officers, both by increasing the competition andremoving some of the opportunities, but the Ministry will continue to do every-thing possible to fit ex-regular officers into suitable openings. ,.The Problem in Industry&apos;&quot;&apos; 7. It is in Recommendation (xi), the general approach to Industry, that, as might be expected, the largest field is to be covered and the progress is leastsatisfactory. In this connection I think that there are two points of importance on which it would be well to clear pur minds. In addition to its: specific recom-mendations, the Wiles Committee made at the outset a point which is particularly important in relation to the way of implementing its Report. They pointed outthat the shortage of labour and reasonable prospects of full, employment meant that jobs of some kind would be available for ex-Regulars for, a long time to come,and that the important thing was to try and ensure that the ex-Regular found
,i;eemployment fpr which he was best fitted and that he entered it.at.the.level atwhich his qualifications and capacity entitled, him.. It is, of course,:the case that(apart from the special problem of the ex-Officer) there is no lack of employment for ex-Regulars. A recent count of ex-Regulars discharged during the year ending 31st July, 1949, and who were unemployed in November showed that thereffere 446 officers and 442 Other Ranks registered with the Ministry of Labouras unemployed. Among Other Ranks this represented 1-2 per cent, at a timeffhen the rate of unemployment for the country as a whole was 1 - 6 per cent.Among officers the rate was very high, viz., 16:8 per cent., and taken together therate was over 2 per cent.   Further details are given in the Appendix.8i- The consideration of finding employment that is suitable has;thus been kept foremost in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s efforts, to create in respect of individual industries the necessary machinery for the absorption of ex-Regulars which that report envisaged. Secondly, so far as numbers are concerned, estimates of theannual number of vacancies occurring as the result of turnover can be made for industry as a whole, and proposals made to individual industries for the allocation of a proportion of such vacancies as do occur to ex-Regulars, provided they are suitable and available at the time and place required. But such proposals, if accepted by industry, can never be expressed as a guaranteed number of vacancies.The number of the actual vacancies, and the places where they arise, will dependin each industry on the number of retirements, the degree of turnover betweenfas, the extent to which the industry is expanding or contracting, and on thegeneral state of trade. In some industries, including some of the nationalised industries, these factors are of less importance, and can be more exactly forecast,but it would be misleading to express even these as guaranteed vacancies..9. Bearing in mind these two considerations, the method of attack has been as follows : On the first point, that of ensuring that the job is one which will enablethe ex-Regular to make full use of his skill and experience, the following measures are important: Skilled men. The work of the Inter-Services Committee on the Recog-nition of Service Tradesmen by Trade Unions, which was described underRecommendation (iii). The Vocational Training provided by the Ministryof Labour described under Recommendation (i). The Business training scheme specially designed for ex-Regulars described under Recommenda-tion (i). The approach to individual industries to consider special schemesof training for ex-Regulars, even though no arrangements with the Ministryof Labour have been reached for vocational training under the generalscheme. ., &apos;Unskilled and semi-skilled men. The absorption of these men innationalised and private industry in other than the most junior capacity is dependent upon the customs of the industry in recruitment. Up to thepresent there has been a refusal on the part of those industries approachedto consider the absorption of ex-Regulars in anything but the bottom of astarting grade from which they would have to work up by means of promotionin the ordinary way. The extent to which promotion goes by seniority ratherthan merit varies from industry to industry, but in many, particularly theRailways, seniority is the most important factor. This attitude of the Unionsis not in accord with the general principle referred to.above, and the questionof principle has been taken up with the Trades Union Congress.10. On the second issue, that of arrangements for the absorption of definitenumbers of ex-Regulars, irrespective of the type of work, the following line haswen taken:      &apos; &apos; v.For the reasons given above, guaranteed vacancies are not applicable,except over a very narrow field such as the Civil Service, where: there is alarge employer with a centralised and formal method of ; recruitment.Instead, a proposal has emerged from discussions with one of the industries by which a proportion of the vacancies occurring in each year in -individual employers&apos; establishments should be allotted as a minimum to newly dis&apos;charged ex-Regulars. This proportion would be calculated on a basis of thenumbers of ex-Regulars coming out of the Forces in a year in relation t&quot;*
the estimated number of vacancies occurring in industry generallyAllowance would be made for the fact that ex-Regulars would not necessarilysettle down in the first job they took, that in the case of many small employersstaffs are so small and engagements so few that it would not be practicable to expect employers to reserve a! proportion of engagements for ex-Regularsand that men would not, in many instances, be available at the time and placerequired. After taking into account these factors, the proposal would bethat one vacancy in every twenty should be allotted to an ex-Regular. Thisproposal is under discussion with the Service Departments, and thereafterwill be put before individual industries and services for their consideration,It is a practical means of ensuring the allocation of these vacancies in the Inationalised industries and services as well as in the private field.11. It must be emphasised that this can only work through voluntary agree-ment of the industry; that there will be no means of enforcement and no exactstatistical evidence about its effect in particular cases or its general efficacy except the measure of the amount of unemployment amongst ex-Regulars who haverecently left the Forces. It may, however, be practicable to obtain informationof a general character about the degree to which larger employers are carryingout the voluntary agreement applicable to their industry.12. Enquiries have also been made about the position of members of TradeUnions when they undertake a period of voluntary service as a regular memberof His Majesty&apos;s Forces. I am informed by the Trades Union Congress that itmay be taken that, on the whole, choice of a career in the Forces is regardedas similar to a move to work in a different industry from that covered by the fUnion in question. In fact, six Unions with a combined membership of 365,0state that volunteers are regarded as lapsed members or, having changed their employment, as ineligible under their rules. Three other unions (230,000members) require full contributions for volunteer members of the Forces tomaintain their membership, while three more (164,000 members) in the building trade require 7s. 6d., 6s. and 2s. quarterly in contributions respectively for maintenance of membership. Two small unions, however, give clear cards andthe National Society of Operative Printers admit ex-members without question on their return from regular service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces. I propose to discuss with the Trades Union Congress the question whether arrangements of this lattersort can be developed more generally so as to facilitate the integration of a careerin the Forces more closely with civil life.G.
