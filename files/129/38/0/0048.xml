Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 4827th March, 1950CABINETUNITED KINGDOM STOCKS  OF ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFSMemorandum by the Minister op food at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 9th March it was suggested that, as a result of uncertainty about future supplies, there was a tendency to build up excessivestocks of feeding-stuffs, some part of which went bad before they could be used,and I was asked to submit a memorandum on the subject (CM. (50) 9th Conclu-sions, Minute 3 (2)).2. All feeding-stuffs are liable to become infested by insects, mites androdents. These creatures have a remarkable capacity for evading the restrictivecampaign of the most skilfully-run Government Department, and, it must beconfessed, are capable of outwitting even the most astute Cabinet. However, I gather that our record in the Food Ministry has not fallen below the generalstandard of achievement in this ancient war between mice and men. I hope this-report will relieve any anxiety my colleagues may feel in the matter.3. The Cabinet&apos;s livestock expansion programme visualised a progressive-and substantial increase in the number of livestock between 1947 and 1952. Coarse-grains had to be provided to meet the consequent increase in farm rations, a task,,of course, which fell to the Ministry of &quot;Food. The measure of this obligationcan be seen from the fact that feeding-stuffs rations in the year to 30th September,1947, amounted to 2f million tons, while in the year ending next September theywill exceed 6 million tons. The risk of trouble from the rodent forces would,,therefore, go up in the same proportion.4. To ensure the uninterrupted flow of supplies under rationing, minimumworking stocks of about 550,000 tons are necessary. In normal circumstances thiswould provide an adequate margin against all contingencies, but conditions are-far from normal. Until the world exportable surplus of non-dollar grain equalsor exceeds the demand, or we can buy freely for dollars, we shall have to insureagainst the unforeseen, by holding stocks which may at times be well above theconvenient working level. On occasions we have had to ship grain within muchshorter periods than we would have preferred, but the alternative was to lose the^supplies to some buyer able to take earlier delivery.5. Obviously this situation has involved some improvisation of storage. Asa rule the best stores are used for wheat and flour, and the coarse grains have hadto be kept in temporary accommodation, mostly on airfields, but also in the open,,with steel sheeting protection. It is this unusual method of storage that has caused some public concern. But in fact the quantity of grain which has been lost is negligible. In the year April 1948 to March 1949, the latest for which com-plete figures are available, there wras a loss of only 4,117 tons out of 1,670,000&apos;tons taken into store. This figure covers losses from all causes, since it is impossibleto isolate infestation losses. I think my colleagues will agree that a loss of only0-25 per cent, of the total turnover from all sources is far from unsatisfactory.6. The principal risks in storing grain are weevil and insect infestationand the depredations of rats and mice. One difficulty last year was that theArgentine maize which arrived in 1948-49 was more than usually infested with38477
weevil. However, ali imported coarse grains arrive with some degree of infesta-tion, and so far as possible the Ministry of Agriculture fumigate the more heavilyinfested cargoes before they go to inland stores. That Department has also tackledthe rats and mice which are bound to affect the improvised stores. Much of the damage in the past year has been done by mice brought into stores inside bags-of grain. They cannot be detected until the bags collapse and the grain spills.When this happens, however, the damage looks much worse than it really is, and-a member of the public who saw it might be rather shocked. To meet this special problem the Ministry of Agriculture have devised a special technique of fumiga-tion, which has been applied to 300,000 tons of grain and has ! proved very successful.7. To a large extent the problem has solved, or at least is solving, itself,in so far as combined stocks of wheat, flour and coarse grains have now fallen toabout 2-4 million tons, of which only some 609,000 tons are coarse grains, and arelikely to be reduced to about 2-3 million tons by the end of June and about 2-1 million tons by the end of September 1950. At these levels we should not be facedwith the difficulties we have experienced in the last eighteen months. I mightadd, however, that even during the period of peak storage no grain was released by my Department which was unfit for the purpose for which it was intended.8. Looking back it can be seen just what risks were involved. Had myDepartment failed to buy large quantities of grain from soft currency sourceswe would have faced the choice of two unpleasant alternatives the purchase of dollar grain or the breakdown of the livestock expansion programme. That wehave avoided either has been made possible only by the cautious policy of main-taining high stocks in the last eighteen months. I think we can safely argue thatthe little the rats and mice and their fellow-gnawers have got from our stores is-a small price to have paid for the guarantee the public have had that their rationswould be honoured.M.
