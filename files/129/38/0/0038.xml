;,&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950I   SECRET     ,CP. (50) 3816th March, 1950.CABINET.  NATURALISATION policy memorandum by the Home Secretary1. On 9th March, in reply to Mr. Roland Robinson, M.P., who asked mewhether in view of the difficulties arising out of divided allegiance as disclosedby the Fuchs case I would refuse the privilege of naturalisation to foreignerswhere the applicant is known to be a Communist sympathiser, I made thefollowing statement :-&quot;It is my duty to consider each application for naturalisation on its merits. But in exercising the discretion entrusted to me by Parliamentunder the British Nationality Act, 1948, to grant or refuse certificateswithout assigning reasons for my decision I shall, of course, bear in mind the lessons to be learned from the Fuchs case.&quot;The purpose of this memorandum is to let my colleagues know what I conceiveto be the lessons of the Fuchs case and how I propose to apply them.2. Hitherto my policy in dealing with applications for naturalisation hasbeen not to regard membership of the Communist Party or association withCommunist activities, whether past or present, as constituting in themselvesgrounds for refusal, provided that the applicant was of good character and wasnot known to be engaged in any activity detrimental to this country. But allapplications from persons with Communist associations have been scrutinisedwith care by senior officers and doubtful cases have been referred to me or to theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State. This policy was adopted deliberatelyand I have more than once reviewed it, but up to now have felt that the balanceof argument was in favour of its continuance. I did not overlook the increasingevidence that a Communist&apos;s first loyalty is to the Soviet Union or the fact that once a Communist has been naturalised his activities, whether in peace or war,are less easily controlled and he cannot be deported. But against this I had toconsider that so long as a citizen of the United Kingdom may join the CommunistParty without loss of civic rights it is illogical to refuse to confer civic rights onan alien solely because he is a member of the Communist Party, that manyCommunist applicants are stateless and could not in practice be deported and thatthe naturalisation of a few hundred alien Communists would not add very seriously to the security problems presented by our home-bred Communists.3. The revelations of Dr. Fuchs show more clearly than ever before howCommunist convictions will brush aside all other loyalties and how completely aperson who believes that he has an overriding duty to the Soviet Union can dis-semble this belief. And I cannot help feeling that, on the whole, Communistconvictions are likely to find readier victims among persons who have not been bornand brought up in this country, though I have no doubt that there are some natural-born British subjects who would be no less prone to succumb. It therefore seemsto me that some modification of the present policy is needed in order to avoidplacing an unfair burden on those who are responsible for securing the safety of,this country.38431Copy No.
4. I therefore intend for the present to refuse applications for naturalisation-tion from : (a) known members of the British Communist Party or of any foreign Com-,       ,       munist Party;(6)&apos; persons who, though not avowed or known members of a Commiitnst Par ty.are associated with Communist activities in such a way as to cast doubt on their loyalty; and oc &quot;: &apos;(c) persons who in the past have been members of a Communist! Party or havebeen closely associated with Communist activities, if there is reason to suppose that their former associations have implanted in them an en-during loyalty to communism.5. I realise that it will not always be easy to apply this policy and that the tests indicated at (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 leave ia good deal of room for argu-ment in particular cases. And I cannot claim that in applying the proposed new policy I shall not sometimes refuse applications the granting of which would dono harm or grant naturalisation to persons who at the time when they apply seemfree from objection but who later are found to have secretly cherished or to havesubsequently developed a compelling loyalty to communism. I can only say that inexercising the discretion conferred on me by Parliament I will do my best to balance fairly the claims of justice to the individual and the claims of Statesecurity.&apos; 6. I do not propose to make any announcement of the change in policy. Thenew policy will be applied also to any persons associated with Fascist organisationsor activities who may seek naturalisation.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,16th March, 1950
