SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 232nd March, 1950CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION-PROPOSED INCREASE OFCHARGESMemorandum by the Minister of transport. At their meeting on 24th November, 1949 (CM. (49) 68th Conclusion?Minute 5), the Cabinet agreed that I should seek the advice of the transport tribunal on an application of the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) for authority under Section 82 of the Transport Act to increase railway freight charges and dock charges, and that I should consult the Lord President and theChancellor of the Exchequer on the terms of the communication to be sent to theTransport Tribunal.In accordance with these directions I referred the matter, together with asimilar application in respect of the Commission^ canal charges, to the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal who, under the Transport Act, act as a consultative Committee for this purpose.2.   The increases proposed are as follows :  Railway Charges:A general increase of 16f per cent, in the present charges applicable tofreight main traffic and to parcels, other merchandise and livestockby passenger train.Dock Charges:(a) An increase from 25 to 50 per cent, over the charges in force on31st August, 1939, in respect of dues on coastwise vessels andcargoes.(6) An increase from 75 to 100&apos; per cent, over the charges in force on31st August, 1939, in respect of other dock rates, dues and charges.Canal Charges:A general increase of 16f per cent, on present charges.3. The Committee sat in public for thirteen days and heard evidence andarguments concerning the application on behalf of the Commission and a numberof bodies representing users of transport, including the National Coal Board,the British Electricity Authority, the Gas Council, the British Iron and steel federation, the Traders&apos; Dock and Harbour Co-ordinating Committee, which included the Chamber of Shipping, and the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committeeon Transport. The last-named represents seventy-seven national and trade organisations.38372 bPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1950
4. Verbatim reports of the Proceedings have been printed and published and afford ample evidence of the comprehensive and searching nature of theenquiry.   Among the issues examined were(a) The accuracy of the estimates of receipts and expenditure for 1950 andfuture years;(b) the extent to which economies had been and might be expected to be made,including economies from staff reductions, increased productivity andintegration;(c) the revenue which might be expected from the activities of B.T.C otherthan railway, docks and canals;(d) the effect of the proposed increase in charges upon industry, export tradeand cost of living and the possibility of postponing the increase with-out undue detriment to B.T.C&apos;s. long-term financial position;(e) the incidence of the increase in charges, including the question whether there should be an increase in railway passenger fares.5. In their reports to me, copies of which are annexed, and which I proposeto publish, the Committee summarise the evidence and arguments, give their con-clusions upon the various issues, and recommend that I should make regulationsauthorising the increases proposed.6. When authorising me to refer the Commission^ application to theCommittee, the Cabinet asked me to arrange for the preparation of a three-year plan for completing the co-ordination of road and rail transport, to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer means of financing such a plan and to submit the resulting proposals for consideration by the Cabinet. I have been in com-mimication with the Chairman of the Commission on this matter. He has intimated to me that it is not possible for the Commission to determine the paceat which the many complicated arrangements involved, in integration can becarried through and, still less, to estimate ahead the financial results beyond thepresent year. At the same time, he indicated that the financial resources of theCommission should suffice for any programmes on which the Commission are likelyto be allowed, for other reasons, to embark during the next two or three years.So far as capital expenditure is concerned, therefore, it will not be necessary forme to approach the Chancellor of the Exchequer for any financial assistance. TheCommission^ difficulty is not so much a lack of capital resources as a large and continuing deficiency in revenue which they see no hope of meeting in the nearfuture on the basis of their existing level of charges. It is evident that theMembers of the Transport Tribunal share the Commission^ views on this subject.Whatever economies may ultimately result from integration it is, in my view,clear that they are long term and cannot for some time to come relieve theCommission of their present financial embarrassment.7. It is, of course, admitted by all that an increase in transport chargescannot but have an adverse effect upon the economy of the country, but I see no answer to the Commission^ argument that if they have to pay substantially more for their coal, their steel and other materials and their labour, they cannot beexpected to keep their own railway charges to a level of only 55 per cent, above pre-war-war.8. I regard the reports of the Transport Tribunal acting as a Consultative&quot;Committee on this matter as going far to determine the issue. Section 82 of theTransport Act, which authorises me to increase charges pending the submission of Charges Schemes to the Tribunal, was designed to meet just such an emergencyas has, in fact, arisen. But, while a decision whether or not to authorise anincrease in charges during this transitional period rests with me, the decision ofthe Transport Tribunal, when comprehensive Charges Schemes are produced, willbe final and not subject to review. It is, I think, of the first importance in thecircumstances to maintain the high prestige of the Tribunal and to avoid anyweakening of public confidence in it such as would result from a rejection in wholeor in part of their present recommendations. The Commission have, in fact,already submitted to the Tribunal an interim Charges Scheme for the london area which involves adjustments in passenger fares which will yield some increasein revenue and will entail the withdrawal of workmen&apos;s fares as such and their replacement by cheap early morning fares which will extend to buses to which
workmen&apos;s fares are not at present applicable. This scheme will raise con-controversial issues upon which the Tribunal will have to give a final decision. Forthese, among other reasons, I propose to disregard a recommendation by theCentral Transport Consultative Committee (who considered it incumbent upon them to examine this question) that before authorising an increase in freight charges I should give full consideration to the wider interests at stake and that- (a) every encouragement and help should be afforded to the Commission in reducing their costs and overheads;(b) the Government should bear the cost of maintaining strategic communi-cations required for national defence.9. The Chairman of the Commission is naturally most anxious that the increases for which they have applied should become operative at the earliestpossible moment. At present the Commission^ deficiency on net revenue amountsto some &amp;\ million a week, so that the deficiency of some  25 million for the year1949 has already been increased by nearly  5 million during the current year.This accumulating deficit will have to be met sooner or later out of revenue. Ifthe deficit is allowed to become too large, it is bound to affect materially the levels of freight and other charges on which the Commission^ Schemes of Charges tobe submitted to the Tribunal will be based.10. It is, therefore, in my view, a matter of urgency that the increases forwhich the Commission have applied should be allowed in full and at once, and Iseek the concurrence of my colleagues in my making the necessary regulations under the Transport Act forthwith to give effect to them.A.

THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE transport tribunal SITTING AS A CONSULTATIVECOMMITTEETo the Right Hon. Alfred Barnes, M.P.,Minister of Transport.Sir,We, the Permanent Members of the Transport Tribunal, have dividedthis our Report into the following parts:Part I. Preliminary.Part II. The case of the British Transport Commission.Part III. Submissions of the Bodies whose representations we heard.Part IV. The Issues and our Conclusions thereon.Part V. Recommendations.PART IPRELIMINARYOn the 28th November, 1949, we received from you a copy of the Applica-tions of the British Transport Commission to you to authorise them by regulations to make in respect of certain of the services and facilities pro-vided on their Railways, Docks, Harbours, Canals and Inland Waterways,the charges for which are regulated by Statutory provisions, charges additional to those in operation under the said provisions, together with your request for our advice thereon, to assist you in determining whether Regulations togive effect to the Commission^ proposals, and if so, to what extent, oughtin the circumstances to be made under the provisions of Section 82 (1) of theTransport Act, 1947. Since you stated that you regarded the matter as oneof extreme urgency and that you did not desire our report on the proposed increase in Railway Charges to be delayed pending any investigation of those relating to Dock and Canal charges, this Report deals only with the proposed increase in Railway Charges, the general effect of which is to increase by16-f per cent, the Railway Charges (other than those for the conveyance of passengers and their luggage) which are regulated by Statutory provisions, andto introduce a new &quot; Smalls &quot; Scale.On the 29th November, we met and drew up a Memorandum of the Pro-cedure which we proposed to follow. A copy of this was sent to you. Wecaused to be advertised in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes and a numberof newspapers circulating in England, Scotland and Wales a Notice dated30th November, 1949, setting out the terms of your reference to us, statingthat we desired to take into consultation Bodies representing classes of personswho use the services or facilities in respect of which additional charges weresought to be imposed, and also Bodies which, having been constituted for thepurpose of any scheme for the carrying on, under National ownership or con-trol, of any industry, or part of an industry or of any undertaking, use thesaid services or facilities, and to hear the representations and views of such bodies, and requesting any such Body desiring to be taken into consultationto give notice to our Secretary on or before December 12th, 1949. The bodies which gave notice of their desire to be heard are set out in Appendix I.In accordance with the Procedure which we had laid down, copies of all relevant documents were supplied to these Bodies and to the British transport commission.   We also on November 30th, sent to all those Bodies which68119A2

from our previous experience were likely to wish to appear, copies of the applications of the British Transport Commission with the explanatory memorandum annexed thereto, your reference to us, the Memorandum of ourProcedure and our Public Notice.On the 13th December, we met again to consider the responses to ourPublic Notice, and having received representations from the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee on Transport and the British Iron and Steel Federationthat without legal assistance they would be placed in a difficulty, we decided,contrary to our original intention, to hear Counsel or Solicitors on behalf ofany body desiring to be heard. We fixedi the place and date of Hearing atLincolns Inn Old Hall on January 4th, 1950. Notice of these decisionswas given to all parties concerned.,On the 20th December, 1949, the British Transport Commission depositedwith us their Case for their Applications together with statements and estimates; copies of these documents were at once sent to or placed at thedisposal of all who had notified their desire to be taken into consultation.On the 4th January, 1950, we met in Lincoln&apos;s Inn Old Hall, when themajority of the aforementioned Bodies appeared by Counsel, Solicitor orrepresentative. Our Inquiry into the proposed increases in Railway Chargeslasted 11 days and ended on 20th January, when we announced that we wouldsit again at the Institution of Civil Engineers on the 7th February, to hearrepresentations on the proposed increases in Dock and Canal Charges.The Appearances are set out in Appendix II.The documents deposited by the Commission were an estimated Consoli-dated Revenue Account for 1949, a Statement of gross Receipts of BritisnRailways for 1948, and estimates for 1949 and 1950, and a statement of theestimated yield of the proposed 16f per cent, increase from Freight Traffic.These three statements marked R.H.W.1 and D.B.1 and 2 respectively are set out in Appendix III to this Report and were amplified by the evidence ofMr. R. H. Wilson, the Comptroller of the Commission and by Mr. DavidBlee, the member of the Railway Executive responsible for the CommercialAffairs of the Railways. The examination and cross-examination of thesetwo witnesses by Counsel and others occupied 4 days, and the centralfeatures of their evidence were:  1. That the Commission^ deficit for the year 1948 was  4.7m. as appears in their Report and Accounts for that year; that the deficit estimated for1949 is about  20.7m. making the total deficit  25.5m. for the two years.2. That Railway gross receipts (including collection and delivery andother road services and disregarding a relatively small adjustment in respectof carriage of coal and other railway stores) will be found to have beennearly  13m. less in 1949 than in 1948 and that for the year 1950 a further fall of  5m. is forecast at present charges.The estimated loss and gains in 1950 compared with 1949 being asfollows:  PART IIOrdinary PassengersSeasons     ......Parcels, Mils and Parcels PostMinerals, classes 1-6Coal .........Losses m.7.1.1Gains m..4.62.47.82.8

3. That economies of approximately  7m. were effected in 1949, substan-tially contributed to by a reduction of some 27,000 staff in one year to november 1949. That any comparison between present and pre-war staffsmust have regard to the reduction in standard hours of duty, increasedannual leave and other altered conditions of employment introduced afterthe war, which are estimated to have involved an increase in staff of about12-J per cent. Further, that no comparison of the numbers of employeesbefore and after the war can be valid without a knowledge of and taking into account the work done, the numbers employed on work chargeable to capital, and pf maintenance not chargeable to revenue.That in 1950 economies of more than  2 to  3m. following those effected in 1949 are not to be expected.&apos;- 4. That, including a repetition in 1950 of the 1949 deficit of  4m. inrespect of Inland Waterways and Docks, the Commission^ deficit for 1950will be some  30 millions as follows:   m.Estimated deficit as in 1949 ............       21Estimated further decline in Railway Traffics     &apos;...... 5Estimated further increases in Railway costs less economies        2Estimated reductions in contributions from London Trans-port, Passenger road traffic outside London and interestearned ...      ...      ...      ..........      ... 2Estimated deficit in 1950     &apos;...............       30m.5. That upon what is regarded by the Commission as a fair and reason-able apportionment of its Central Charges, Administration, Interest on british Transport Stock, etc., among each of its Principal activities, the maincause of the deficit estimated for 1950 arises from Railways, Inland Water-ways and Docks and that but for the contributions from other activities and sources the Commission would require to raise in 1950 from Railways,Inland Waterways and Docks, additional revenue of some  39m. insteadof the  28m. their proposals are designed to produce.6. That no attempt was now being made to liquidate the deficit of  25 m.for 1948 and 1949 ; that the proposals to secure additional revenue of some 28m. (which made no provision to enable the Commission to comply withits Statutory obligation to create a general reserve or to meet enhanced costs of replacement) were the minimum requirements of the Commission in viewof the uncertainty of the future as to the level of their costs and the imprac-practicability of further substantial economies being made before the integration of Inland Transport, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1947is or is nearly accomplished, if the finances of the Commission are to be prevented from deteriorating further.7. That Railway Charges which produce the bulk of the Commission^gross revenue are now, in general, 55 per cent, over the pre-war chargeswhereas costs of labour and material are about 120 per cent, above pre-warand that this is the primary reason for the present unbalanced state of theirnet revenue.8. As regards the prospect of obtaining additional revenue in 1950 from sources other than those proposed.(i) That from ordinary passenger fares no addition can be expectedsince, having regard to the effect of the 1947 increase on passengerreceipts, the 1949 downward passenger trends and an anticipated reduc-68119A3

tion in marginal spending power in 1950, the Commission believes thata further increase in such fares would not only fail to produce morerevenue but would probably result in less revenue therefrom than isestimated at the present fares.i(ii) That though some additional revenue might be obtained by anincrease in Season Ticket Rates and Workmen&apos;s Fares on British Rail-ways, such an increase now is undesirable and inexpedient because thereis about to be submitted to the Transport Tribunal a Charges Scheme(for all Passenger rail and road fares including British Railways in theLondon Area. About one-half of the total revenue of British Railwaysfrom Season Tickets and Workmen&apos;s Fares arises in the London Area.l(iii) The Scheme for the London Area cannot come into force until some months after it has been settled by the Transport Tribunal, and little, if any, additional revenue from London Transport can be looked for in 1950.(iv) That additional revenue from provincial road passenger trans-port cannot be looked for since the whole of the Commission^ interesttherein consists at present of share holdings in companies whose faresare controlled by the Statutory Licensing Authorities.(v) That no material additional net revenue is to be expected fromroad haulage ; though net traffic receipts may increase by  lm. therewill be extra capital charges of about the same amount. The integra-tion of Road Haulage is far from complete, the Commission is still&apos;engaged in acquiring thousands of undertakings, and consolidatingthem ; the charges are governed almost completely by the local marketsby the competition of &quot; C &quot; licences and other road haulage outside thecontrol of the Commission and that substantial changes in existingcharging arrangements must await the settlement of the Charges Scheme.9. That the only practicable means of obtaining the additional revenuerequired is by an equal percentage addition to freight Charges and that unless steps are now taken to obtain that revenue the accumulated deficitat the end of 1950 is likely to be between  50 and  60m. and looking beyond that to the date, which it is not possible now to specify, when the rail and road activities are integrated and a Charges Scheme therefor brought intoforce a deficit accumulating at the rate of anything like the  30m. forecast for 1950 would have a most disturbing effect on the Scheme.PART iii the SUBMISSIONS OF THE BODIES WHOSE REPRESENTATIONSWE HEARDThe evidence and submissions of the British Iron and Steel Federationwere to the following effect: (A) As regards the effect on Industry of an increase of Railway Rates: 1. That the present is a grave and critical moment in the industrialhistory of this country; it is an anxious moment in the fight forthe economic life of the country and an inopportune one to lay anyburden on industry, and particularly upon the heavy industries whichtake so prominent a part in the attempt to re-establish the countryin the industrial world, unless driven thereto by compulsive reasons.2. That it would have widespread repercussions on a wide range of products, steel itself, things using steel and other products, at a

time when every effort is being made not only by the Steel industry but all other industries to try and keep prices, the cost of living and wages stable, in line with the Government policy.3. That consequent upon devaluation the Steel Industry&apos;s increased costs on imported materials in 1950 will be about  4 m. a year.4. That between August and November, 1949, wholesale prices roseby 5 per cent.; that the cost of living has increased since Augustlast by 2 points to 113, and that the London and Cambridge EconomicServices examining the question in November, 1949, formed the viewthat by the Spring, 1950, a rise of 5 per cent, was to be expected,bringing the cost of living index to the critical figure of 118.5. That the increase of rail rates in 1946 from 16f per cent, to 25 percent, over pre-war resulted in steel prices being increased by 5s. perton and the further rail increase in 1947 to 55 per cent, over pre-war was followed by an increase of 18s. 6d. per ton in the heavy steelsections, of which 10s. 2d. represented the rail increase both increases in price being approved by the Ministry of Supply.6. That the effect of the proposed 16-f- per cent, addition to RailCharges will be to increase the per ton cost of Basic Pig Iron by4s. 8d. ; Hematite Pig Iron by 4s. lOd. and Steel by 9s. 2^d., andthat the latter may go to 10s. if the price of coke rises on accountof the rail increase.7. That an increase in Steel prices in similarly affecting a wide range of other industries may frustrate pro tanto the main benefit sought to be derived from devaluation the cheapening of British goods inrelation to dollar goods, and a strengthening of our competitive positionto rectify the balance between dollar and sterling purchases.8. That the Report of the Steel Division of the Economic commission for Europe lays emphasis on the importance wherever possible of price reductions in Europe, if Europe as a whole is to be successful incompeting with America.(B) As regards the Commission^ estimated deficit of  30m. in the year1950, based on a continuance of the existing level of charges, it was submitted that this was an excessive estimate. The contention being 1. As regards receipts :(a) That in view of the increase in steel production now being obtained and planned to continue, together with the release ofsteel from stock, it was reasonable to expect increased rail carryingsof steel and the raw materials for its production of 1 to \\ million tons.(b) That whereas no additional revenue from road haulage orLondon Transport had been estimated by the Commission, itwas suggested that there ought to be expected an additional  lm.from the former, and from the latter in the last three months ofthe year  1-J-m. ; and it was further said that the Commission in estimating a fall of  7.1m. in Ordinary Passenger receipts had given undue weight to an anticipated reduction of marginal spending power in 1950, and that  4-Jm. was an adequate fall to allow for ;also that additional receipts of  lm. from minerals in classes 1-and  lm. from merchandise in classes 7-21 might be anticipated making an addition of  4-^m. to the Commission^ estimate underthe last three heads.

2. As regards expenditure, that greater economies ought to be achievedthan had been allowed for, and that taking the Transport commission as a whole, economies should be looked for of &quot;  5m. this year and perhaps supported by a further  10m. in 1951, a total of  15m. on present costs. That might be achievable in 1951, and possibly in1952 something like  20m., or  10m. in a half-year looking to the middleof 1952&quot;, on the basis of Transport working on the same lines asindustry in relation to productivity.Great stress was laid on increased productivity. It was pointed out that industry had achieved in 1949 a 5 per cent, increase in productivity, meaningthereby &quot; output per man in a year&quot;, and anticipated a further increaseof 5 per cent, in 1950, and it was submitted that additional economies of 5m. in 1950 and a further  10m. in 1951, in the Commission^ Undertakings,though large figures in themselves, were not large in relation to workingcosts of  312m. and ought to be achievable.The comparison was made between the pre-war position when the staffnumbered 550,000 and freight train traffic was 298m. tons, and 1948 whenthe staff was 650,000 and freight train traffic was 276m. tons.It was submitted that though a reduction in staff was effected in the yearended November, 1949, of 27,000, &quot;it is unsatisfactory and out of line with industrial experience to sit back in 1950 and say we cannot look for morethan  2m. or  3m. altogether, including several hundred thousands on other things &quot; besides staff reductions.The Federation, while contending that additional receipts of some  7m.might possibly be expected in 1950, submitted that if additional receipts of 24m. only were assumed, and additional economies of some  5m. allowed for, the Commission^ estimated deficit of  30m. in 1950 would be reducedto  22)m., and further submitted that in 1951 and 1952 additonal annualreceipts of  6m. from London Transport and  4m. from Road Haulage might reasonably be expected, which with the additional economies of  15m. in1951 and  20m. in 1952, would result in a deficit for 1951 of  5m. and nodeficit for 1952, and this without assuming additional revenue from any source other than London Transport and Road Haulage. We were invitedtherefore to regard the period during which deficits would be made by theCommission as temporary.Upon this submission the accumulated deficit for the years 1948, 1949,1950 and 1951 would be  52% m. or approximately one-half of the deficitenvisioned by the Commission.Confidence was expressed with regard to the financial stability of theCommission when the integration of transport provided for in the transport act has been carried out ; and before that, it was contended, that it was reasonable to assume that as step by step measures of partial integration were carried out additional receipts and economies would result therefrom so thaton the eve of complete integration as provided for by the Act, a material improvement in the finances of the Commission will have been effected.It was recognised that upon the settlement of the Charges Scheme the accumulated deficit, whatever it might be, would have to be liquidated andit was contended that the suggested accumulated deficit of some  50m though in itself a large figure was not an undue burden for the Commission to carrytemporarily having regard to the magnitude of the Commission^ activities,and was one which the Commission was well able to carry.

It was submitted that risks had to be taken whichever conclusion was arrived at by the Committee, on the one hand the risks that the accounts of the Commission would not balance by about 1952, and thus an un-manageable total deficit might accumulate, and on the other hand the severerisk, if these extra freight costs had to be carried by the steel and otherindustries, of hitting industries vital to the recovery of our economic life andof taking one more step in the spiral inflation.We were pressed to take a more optimistic outlook of the position of theCommission, between the present and the time of the completion of integration of rail and road and the coming into force of the Charges Scheme, than thattaken by the Commission, and to advise that no regulations should nowbe made authorising the Commission to increase their present statutorycharges.Alternatively, it was submitted, that if the conclusion is reached that increased charges ought to be levied to prevent the existing deficit of approxi-mately  25^m. being added to, present relationships between freight ratesand passenger  ares ought to be maintained and the rates and fares on alltraffic should be advanced equally and no differential accorded in favourof coal.The National Coal Board, The British Electricity Authority and the gas council did not contest the claim of the Commission to be authorised tomake such additional charges as would enable its accounts to be balanced,and none of their witnesses offered any criticism with regard to the economieseffected or to be effected by the Commission.Each of these Industries by its Statute is required to meet its outgoings ;in the case of the Coal Board on the average of good and bad years and inthe case of the Electricity and Gas Industries, taking one year with another,and to create a reserve.It was said that the effect of a 16f per cent, increase in coal rates wouldbe to put up the cost to the consumer of their respective products, theevidence being:  ,(i) For the Coal Board that the Home Consumer paid the carriagecharges and the delivered price to him would go up on average by Is. 6d.per tgn for the whole country, for London by 3s. Od. on average and up to5s. 7d. on coal carried from Yorkshire to Cornwall, but that upon export coal and bunkers, the price being f.o.b., the increase averaging ll^d. perton would fall on the Board as it is not possible in the conditions oftoday to increase the export selling price. In addition the cost of theincrease averaging 4d. per ton would fall on the Board for coal carriedbetween Collieries and Washeries.(ii) For the Gas Council, that the additional burden the Industry wouldhave to carry was about  2m. a year exclusive of any increase in theprices of their stores and materials ; that the Industry could not absorb the increase, which would have to be passed on to the consumer.(iii) For the British Electricity Authority, that their costs would go upby some  1 Jm. a year exclusive of any increase in the cost of their stores and would have to be passed on to their consumers; in the case ofindustry passed aon immediately upon an increase in the price of coal.But the main and most pressed submission of these three Industries, andto which their evidence was chiefly directed was that their coal traffic wasthe most economical to work of all railway traffics and the most profitable

to the Commission and upon that ground it was contended that the relationship of coal rates to other rates ought properly to be altered in favour of coal,and that whatever additional charges the Commission might be authorisedto make, a differential should be established in favour of coal by imposing a smaller increase on coal rates than on other rates. None of the witnessescalled by these Industries made any suggestions as to what this differentialshould be.For the National Coal Board the claim for the differential treatment oicoal now was made on grounds of public policy and national interest, andin view of the crucial importance of keeping down prices and costs in the basic and exporting industries during the next three years.The contention that a differential in favour -of coal was justified because ofthe economy in working coal traffic and of it being most profitable to theCommission was a matter the Coal Board preferred to he left to he gone into on the submission of the Charges Scheme.Counsel for the Coal Board: suggested&apos; that on the basis of the Commis-sion&apos;.s estimates for 1950, amended to give effect to the evidence of theCoal Board that an increase of charges would not result in any diversion ofcoal from rail, the additional revenue sought could be obtained by anincrease of 8  per cent, in coal rates and an increase of 20 per cent, in therates for other traffic.Dn behalf of the Gas Council it was submitted that a lesser increase shouldbe imposed on coal now, both on1 the ground of National interest and on theground of the economical character of coal traffic as regards railway working.The British. [Electricity Authority submitted on both the grounds referredto above, that differential treatment should now be given to coal, and whileunable to suggest the amount of that differential, submitted that as a minimumit should be 3 per cent, based upon the evidence of the coal interests that anincrease in coal rates would not result in any coal traffic, being diverted fromrail, whereas the Commission had estimated for a 1\ per cent. loss.For the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders at was said that exports of motor vehicles amount to  170m. a year, of which 30 per cent, goto hard currency countries. The direct effect of the proposed increase on export sales would (be to add  4&apos; 11s. 7d. to the cost of a small car and 8 6s. 4d. to the cost of a large oar, in those cases where cars for exporttravelled by rail to the port. Competition was acute, the Seller&apos;s market inthe United States had ended and1 the addition of a few pounds to the pricemay have a marked effect on sales, especially in the United States and inthose countries where import restrictions are related to value.- That Manufacturers feared that, when a Charges Scheme for Rail and road came to be considered, charges will start off at a higher level, if anincrease is now authorised&apos; than they will if no increase is authorised to-day.The Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee on Transport, representative of77 National and Trade Organisations, which includes the Federation ofBritish Industries and the Chambers of Commerce, and on whose behalfthe Technical director of the Federation of British Industries, a member ofthe Committee gave evidence, brought to our notice the representations theyhad received from some of their constituent bodies the Food Manufacturers&apos;Federation, the National Association of Seed Potato Merchants, the BritishMetal Window Manufacturers&apos; Association, the National Federation of Dyersand Cleaners, the British Trawlers Federation, the Association of British

Chemical Manufacturers, the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation, theBritish Non-Ferrous Metals Federation, the Fertilisers&apos; Manufacturers&apos; Asso-ciation and. the National Federation off Clay Industries.The general effect of ail these representations was that the proposed freightincreases must lead to higher prices at home, an increase in the cost ofliving, raising the index towards the critical figure of 118 and a reduction ofthe Export Trade.The Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee also submitted that at this time ofcrisis for British Industry every effort should be made ito avoid an increasein railway freights. That the grave remedy of devaluation had beenadopted in an effort to assist the National economy, land that if prices rise.the benefits of this policy will be lost. That devaluation has inevitably1caused a rise in the price of raw materials obtained from abroad and that industry is trying to absorb these extra costs without increasing prices,but that a rise in railway freights of 16-f per cent, cannot generally be absorbed. That industries able to take advantage of road transport willdesert the railways and, those tied to the railways must increase their prices.That the alternative to raising railway rates is to reduce railway working expenses drastically and at once.That the economies which the Commission expect to achieve in 1950of some  2m. to  3m., being less than 1 per cent, of the working costs ofover  300rn., are inadequate; that economies of a far larger amount areimperative and that if such economies are achieved it should be possibleto avoid any increase in rates between the present time and the intro-duction of the new Charges Schemes.That if the Commission are unable to devise the necessary economies,they should seek the assistance of independent Industrial Consultants.That the enormous rise in railway staff since the War and the fact that part of the Commission^ Undertaking is being run at a loss, suggest thatthere is considerable scope for economy.,We were also given a list of a large number of Associations representingTraders and of Chambers of Commerce protesting against any increase in railway rates on the ground of its effect on prices.On behalf of the Hull Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping,it was submitted that an all-round percentage increase of rates was not thebest method of meeting the deficit. That having effected all possible econo-mies, the Commission should look to those particular services which wereobviously losing money, and put those charges up. The general percentage increase may act inequitably, as for example by magnifying the differencebetween one rate and another which may seriously affect the areas in whichcompeting traders can distribute their products. A system of flat rateincreases would be less harmful and might in addition to earning morerevenue serve to remove anomalies. Alternatively, authority should begiven for graduated percentage increases tapering with the mileage ; if, how-ever, it should be decided to authorise the all-round percentage increases,the pre-war relativity between producing and distributing centres on theone hand and consuming centres on the other should be restored and main-tained by the granting of exceptional rates.Submissions were also made with regard to Canal and Dock Charges, andthese we will take into consideration when later we examine into and reporton those matters

The submission of the National Farmers&apos; Union was that this is a most fortunate time to have chosen for an increase in freight rates. Farmerspay the transport charges on the materials they buy but are unable to passon any increase to the purchasers of their produce. It is estimated that every year 5.8m. tons of fertiliser feeding stuff and seeds are brought to farmsat a cost of  7.8m. and a further sum of  4m. is incurred for freight charges on machinery, livestock, sugar beet and vegetables. Farmers are thereforecalled upon to contribute  2m. directly to the losses of the Transport Corn-mission. These losses should not be passed on to Trade and Industry, but should be borne by the National Exchequer. But if it is decided to authorisethe increases, passengers should contribute.The National Federat&apos;on of Fruit and Potato Trades Limited, reported a perceptible and progressive decline in the purchasing power of the Con-sumer in 1949, and submitted that the proposed increase in freight rates would, if granted, adversely affect the production and consumption of fruit and vegetables, and that in the National interest the existing charges shouldnot be increased.The National Federation of Scrap Iron, Steel and Metal Merchants, in a written statement, submitted that an increase in freight charges at the pre-sent period would raise commodity prices, increase personal spending, may cause an alteration in the cost of living index and is contrary to the Publicinterest. The present position should be treated as an interim period, andthe deficit should be borne by a Treasury loan or a payment from the excess earnings over expenditure retained by the Government during theyears 1941 to 1945. The proposed increases would cost the Scrap Ironand Steel Industry  669,000 a year, and would increase the cost of ScrapIron and Steel by sums varying from Is. 4d. to 4s. 8d. a ton according tothe location of the consuming Works. They also stated that the surpriseof the attack and the short time allowed between the notice and the hearinghad prevented them from examining in greater detail the case put forward by the Commission.The Home Timber Merchants&apos; Association of Scotland, also in a written statement, protested against the proposed increases on the ground that thepresent classification of timber had been accepted under reservation by theHome Timber trade in Scotland, and because the percentage increase willthrow a greater burden on home timber owing to the greater length of haulthan on imported timber.The Hull Fishing Vessel Owners&apos; Association submitted a protest inwriting against the proposed increases. They draw attention to unemploy-ment in the fishing industry and to the fact that trawlers are now being laid up on account of the rising costs of procuring fish coupled with adeclining public demand, and point out that any increase in the cost ofcoal will intensify their problems and make it increasingly difficult to meetforeign competition.PART iv the ISSUES AND OUR conclusions the purpose of this part of our Report is to define by reference to therival contentions of the parties at our Inquiry the issues before us and tostate our conclusions thereon.   Some repetition may be unavoidable.No question was raised in regard to the estimated deficit of  21m. for 1949.

The main question that was debated was whether the Commission ought not in 1950 to show a substantially better result than was estimated fromthe operation of all its activities. The submissions made as to the means by which a better result ought to be secured were common to all the repre-sentative bodies appearing, viz.: by assuming higher receipts and far greater economies than the Commission had allowed for in their estimate:the latter is by far the most important issue.The principal attack on the estimate for 1950 was that of the british iron and Steel Federation, whose submissions covered the objections of practically all the other critics.They urged that in a total for Railway Working Expenses of upwards of  300m. economies of a good deal more than the  2-3m. allowed for oughtto be realisable. They freely admitted that they could only deal with thismatter on broad lines as they were not engaged in the Transport business.They approached the matter from their own experience in industrial manage-ment and as users of Railway Services. The drive for efficiency in industry had produced an increase of some 5 per cent, in productivity per man year.They recognised that the conditions of the Transport Industry are not thesame as those of other industries, but contended that efficient managementshould produce similar economies, though not perhaps at quite such a high level.The question of what can be expected to be achieved by the Commissionin the way of economies in the immediate and in the foreseeable futurewas one of the principal matters dealt with by the Comptroller of theCommission. His evidence was to the following effect:  (a) That the Commission is not operating any of its services; thatis the work of the Executives. It stands apart and so preserves its position as a critic of what is being done in the field of day to day management. The most urgent and exhaustive examinations into theefficiency of all forms of transport are going on the whole time at thehands of the Commission.(b) That the Commission have taken and continue to take all measures that are practicable in the direction of securing economy that are con-sistent with the performance of its statutory duties. That in the main,major economies can be secured only by radical changes in working conditions or as a result of fundamental alterations in the technicalorganisation of transport, and these cannot be obtained until the system has been integrated as conceived by the Transport Act. Meantime,the economies and improvements which can be secured will hardly be large enough to offset the further increases in costs over and abovethe existing level which must be expectedj(c) That economies of some  7m. had been effected in 1949, and areduction of staff of some&quot;( 27,000 in the year ended November, 1949 ;that economies of similar magnitude and reductions in staff of that order could not be expected in 1950 and the following years.That following on the economies and reductions in staff above referred to,greater economies than the  2-3m. allowed for could not be expected. we feel that the material at our disposal for determining this difference is inadequate.The estimated economies in 1950 appear disappointingly small, but inthe circumstances, we can only ^assume that those responsible for the conductof the Commission^ activities are best able to forecast what economiesthey are likely to achieve and we have no justification for rejecting theevidence of the Comptroller of the Commission.

As to the estimated receipts for passenger traffic on British Railways in1950, the Federation submitted that the fall compared with 1949 wouldbe  2.5m. less than the  7m. estimated by the Commission. In view ofthe continuing downward trend in passenger receipts, we think we should adopt the views of the Commission.As to Freight Traffic on British Railways, the Federation thought thatclasses 7 to 21 might produce  lm. more than the Commission^ estimate.But it; is our opinion that, in view of the ever growing competition of vehicles operating under &quot; C&quot; licences, there is doubt whether even theCommission^ estimate will be reached. On a conservative estimate such these vehicles as exceed 1-J tons unladen weight are likely to carry some270m. tons in 1950, against some 130m. tons in 1946, while the total freightcarried by the Railways in 1946 was 263m. tons and the estimate for 1950is 276m. tons. Nevertheless, we are prepared to accept the estimate of theCommission.As to the Mineral Classes 1 to 6, the Federation again thought that theestimate of the Commission was too low by  lm. The Traffic of these classes also suffers from the competition of the &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles, though not to the same degree as the traffic in the higher classes. And trafficinvolved in road construction and building also suffers from the government policy of restricting capital expenditure. We again think we should acceptthe estimate of the Commission.With regard to revenue from the Road Haulage Executive, the Corn-mission took a conservative view contending that if this source should yieldan additional  lm. in 1950, this would only suffice for the interest on thestock issued for the purchase of the vehicles. The Federation submitted thatthe additional revenue from this source should he  2m. in 1950 and  4m.in 1951. The Commission^ Transport Statistics show that the average numberof the Road Haulage Executive vehicles in service in 1949 was between19,000 and 20,000. We were informed that the number at present owned by this Executive is 46,000 and the acquisition of the vehicles of the long distance hauliers is proceeding fast. These figures lead&apos; us to believe that theCommission^ estimate of their revenue from this source may be too low.But the extent to which this may have been underestimated would not wethink materially affect the deficit estimated for 1950.With regard to Road Passenger Services, we were told by the commission that there are practical difficulties in the way of increasing fares ; at present their only voice in the matter was through the shares they held in the operating companies. Each of these companies was a separate legal entity,and could only increase its fares by applying to the Traffic Commissioners. to succeed in such an application it would be necessary to prove a financialneed which generally did not exist.We therefore came to the conclusion that in 1950 neither the receipts northe economies in respect of the operations of the Commission will be greaterthan the Commission allowed for in their estimate, and we are satisfied thata deficiency of approximately  30m. is to be expected in 1950.But in our opinion an important issue we have to determine is whether theconditions which are expected to produce this deficit in 1950 are likely tocontinue or not. For if these conditions are permanent, then it is essential,that the charges should foe increased. We therefore have to consider what arethe prospects of the Commission looking beyond 1950 up to the time when a Charges Scheme has been brought into operation and rail and road trafficcan foe integrated.

100The submission of the Federation, to which we have already referred, that by 1952 the Commission may be expected to be paying its way is one thatwe cannot accept. We consider that in 1951 and 1952, the deficits at presentcharges are not likely to be materially less than estimated for 1950.lOn the basis that a Rail and Road Charges Scheme may, as was suggested,be brought into force in 1952, the accumulated deficit upon the present viewof the Comptroller of the Commission will be in the region of  100m. andthat deficit will have to be liquidated ; we do not consider we are competentor required to express an opinion upon the true meaning of the expression&quot; taking one year with another &quot; in Sections 3 (4) and 85 of the Act of 1947,but looking at the matter as we see it in regard to the interests of the users of the Commission^ services, any attempt to liquidate such a deficit throughthe medium of the Charges Scheme would we think be highly detrimental to such users and to the Commission.Our conclusion is that as far as can now be foreseen, a deficit in the region of  100m. may well have accumulated by the middle or end of 1952 : thatit is in the interest of the users of the Commission^ services and of the Corn-mission that steps should now be taken to secure additional revenue.The next issue for us to determine is how the additional sums requiredcan best be raised. The submission of. all the representative bodies appearing,except the three Nationalised Industries and the Hull Incorporated Chamberof Commerce and Shipping, was that it should be by the appropriate per-centage increase levied on all traffic including passengers.The Commission^ proposal was that they should be authorised to make thesame percentage additions ,to all freight charges on British Railways withoutany addition to Passenger Fares.Ordinary Passenger Fares were excluded because an increase would not produce additional revenue but was more likely to result in less revenue than would be obtained at present fares. The only additional revenue that couldbe expected from Ordinary Passengers was to be looked for, not by increasingfares, but by offering cheap facilities wherever they may be expected to createnew travel. Our attention was drawn to the effect of the increases of 1947which (failed to produce any higher revenue in 1949. There was no sign ofany change in the falling trend of passenger receipts, and marginal spending power available for railway travel seemed likely to decline in 1950.On behalf of the Federation it was submitted that the downward trend of passenger receipts was less pronounced in the later than in the earlier monthsof 1949.Our attention was drawn to the increase in industrial production during1949, an increase which was largely responsible for a somewhat similarpercentage increase in the level of wages. It was submitted that both theseproduction and wages increases might be expected to continue during 1950,and so more money would become available which would enable people to travel in spite of high fares.,We find it very difficult to believe that there will be such an increase inspending power in 1950 that increased railway travel might be expected, nor do we see any convincing signs that the steady decline in receipts from this source has been checked and we agree with the Commission that no additionalreceipts can be obtained by increasing ordinary fares.There was not so much difference of opinion regarding the possibility ofobtaining extra receipts from an increase in Season Ticket Rates and Work-men^ Fares, but we agree with the Commission that it is highly undesirable

to deal with Season Tickets and Workmen&apos;s Fares outside London when thosewithin the London Area are so shortly to be the subject of an inquiry inconnection with the Charges Scheme for the London Transport Area.We therefore accept the reasons put forward by the Commission for exclud-ing all passenger fares from the additional charges which you are now askedto authorise.The National Coal Board, the British Electricity Authority and the gas council did not press for any increase in passenger fares, but were concerned to secure a lower percentage increase on coal rates than on rates for othertraffic.We are not of opinion that a higher&quot; percentage addition should be made atthe present time to other rates in order that a lower percentage should beapplied to coal rates, and we think that whatever case there may be fordifferentiating in favour of coal must be left for consideration when theCharges Scheme is presented.The only other dissent from a uniform percentage on all Freight traffic was that of the Hull Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping.This Body urged us to impose a system of flat rate increases or a system of graduated percentage increases tapering with the mileage. We do not thinkthat this is a suggestion that is practicable to adopt at this juncture.No specific criticism was directed to the proposed &quot; Smalls &quot; Scale. Wehave examined this scale, which appears to bring the charge for Small Parcelsup to approximately 80 per cent, over pre-war. We think this is a fairadjustment in view of the additional charges we are advising you to authorisein the case of other freight charges.One certain effect of increasing charges will be to divert some traffic.The Commission estimate that this diversion will reduce the theoreticaladditional yield of a 16f per cent, increase from  36.2m. to an actual yield of  26.3m. a loss of nearly  10m. as shown in Statement D.B.2 set out inAppendix III.In view of the evidence of the Coal interests that no diversion of coal traffic was to be anticipated, this loss of  10m. may be to some extent overstated.But as we consider that increased charges in other classes of traffic will in-tensify the competition of &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles, a competition more intractablethan that formerly felt from A and B licence holders, we think that the netyield from the increased rates will not exceed the Commission^ estimate.All the bodies with which we consulted represented in the strongest terms the damage they anticipated to the industrial economy of the country fromthe increases proposed, and the consequential effect on the cost of living index.Most of the evidence was of a general character. This is scarcely to bewondered at, but it leaves us unable to do more than offer you our opinionthat this increase must be reflected in some advance in the cost of living index.Earnest representations were made to us as to the serious effect the increase will have on the efforts of industry to increase production, to capture export markets and to restore the economic life of the country.We have therefore considered whether we should advise that the increase should be postponed for a time. We are satisfied that it cannot be postponed until the Charges Schemes are brought into force, and as we see no reason-able hope that conditions may be so changed within say a year that the increase would not then have the effect on industry which is so greatly feared at thepresent time, and having regard to the detriment of such delay on the finances of the Commission, we do not advise postponement.

PART VRECOMMENDATIONOur advice is that you should make regulations authorising the Commissionto make on their Railways the additional charges specified in the Scheduleto their Application.We will advise you with respect to their Canal, Docks and Harbourscharges as soon as we have concluded our Inquiry.W.

MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTREPORT OFDOCKS AND CANALSTransport TribunalLONDON: HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE1950NET

THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE transport tribunal SITTING AS A CONSULTATIVECOMMITTEETo the Right Hon. Alfred Barnes, M.P.,Minister of Transport.Sir,We, the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal, refer to our Reportto you dated the 6th February, 1950, on the Application of the british transport Commission for authority to make additional charges on theirRailways, and we now, in continuation thereof, submit to you our Report onthe Applications of the Commission for authority to make additional charges in respect of their Harbours, Docks and Piers and their Canals and inland waterways.On the 7th and 8th February, we continued our Inquiry at the institution of Civil Engineers, and heard the evidence of the witness for the Commissionand the representations of Counsel for the Commission, the Traders&apos; dock and Harbour Co-ordinating Committee, including the Chamber of Shipping,the National Coal Board and the British Electricity Authority.This Report is divided into the following Parts Part    I Harbours, Docks and Piers.Part   II Canals and Inland Waterways.Part III Our Conclusions and Recommendations.PART IHARBOURS, DOCKS AND PIERSThe Commission^ Docks in the aggregate represent 30 per cent, of the port facilities of the Country, measured on length of Quays, and deal with about40 per cent, of the weight of goods imported and exported foreign and coast-wise.The excess of working expenses over gross receipts in 1948 was  1.3m.,and in 1949 and 1950 is estimated at  lm.Upon the Commission^ apportionment of the central charges to which we made reference in Part II paragraph 5 of our Report of 6th February, the true deficit for each of these years is some  2m. greater.The proposals of the Commission are to increase the surcharge on the pre-war statutory dues on ships and goods from the present 25 per cent, to50 per cent, in the case of coastwise services and from 75 per cent, to 100 percent, in the case of all other dues.These proposals are designed to obtain some  926.000 additional grossreceipts in a full year (of which approximately 87 per cent, would be obtainedfrom foreign going vessels and their cargoes and 13 per cent, from coastwisevessels and their cargoes) and so in a full future year to secure nearly a balance of gross receipts and working expenses: it is not anticipated thatthese increases will have any adverse effect on the volume of traffic passing through the undertakings.The foregoing is taken from the statements which were lodged by theCommission, and which had been in the possession of all interested sincebefore Christmas last, except for one relatively small addition made to theestimate of a future year when what may be regarded as the final results for

ilu1949 were available. This adjustment was an addition of  200,000 to the gross receipts and a like addition to the working expenses, leaving the deficit for a future year  1m. as originally estimated but increasing the yield fromthe proposed increases from the  900,000 originally estimated to  926,000.Sir Robert Letch, the Deputy Chairman of the Docks and Inland Water-ways Executive, gave evidence in support of the Commission^ proposals and dealt comprehensively with all the matters which appeared to us to be relevant. This branch of our Inquiry lasted 1 \ days and Sir Robert&apos;s evidenceunder examination and cross-examination by Counsel on behalf of theChamber of Shipping, the National Coal Board and the British electricity authority occupied one day.Before referring to the evidence of Sir Robert, we think it will be con-venient to set out the matters which were raised by the above three bodies,by the Hull Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping in the earlier part of our Inquiry and by the Hull Fishing Vessel Owners&apos; Association ina written representation.The Chamber of Shipping and the Traders&apos; Dock and HarbourCo-ordinating Committee stressed the overriding requirement of trade andindustry that the best and most efficient facilities should be provided at themost economical cost, and the detrimental effect on trade and industry,- andparticularly on the export trade of an increase of charges at the presentcritical stage of the country&apos;s economic situation. They did not, however,resist the proposed increases, bearing in mind the increased level of chargesauthorised at Non-Commission ports if we were satisfied . that a smallerincrease than that proposed, combined with greater efficiency and further economies, would not suffice to achieve the Commission^ immediate pur-pose.  But the Chamber pressed two submissions (i) That, whereas the effect of the Commission^ proposal with respectto coastwise traffic is to increase the present charges by 20 per cent., theeffect with respect to all other traffic is to increase the present chargesby 14.3 per cent.; that this lessened the differential in favour of coast-wise traffic granted by your Order of the 15th September, 1947, which itwas claimed should be maintained, by reducing the Commission^ pro-posal of a 50 per cent, increase upon coastwise traffic to 43 per cent,and so putting no greater increase on coastwise traffic than on othertraffic.(ii) That Eire had always been treated as within the range of coastal shipping until it was excluded by your above Order, and should now be restored to its traditional position. Among other grounds in supportof this contention it was pointed out that Eire was included in the definition of coastal shipping in Section 125 of the Transport Act, 1947,and that, upon representations being made to the National Coal board at the end of 1947, the Board decided to restore the past shipping practiceof treating Eire as part of the coasting trade in computing coal bunkerprices.The National Coal Board offered no criticism of the conduct of the Corn-mission^ Undertaking, nor did they dispute in any way the necessity for theCommission raising sufficient revenue to balance their budget. It was pointedout that the duty of the Board was not merely to produce coal but also tomake &quot; supplies of coal available - of such qualities and sizes and in suchquantities and at such prices as may seem to them best calculated to further the public interest in all respects.&quot;

In view of this duty the Board considered it proper upon an Inquiry ofthis nature to draw attention to the effect which increased transport charges would have on the price of coal. They accordingly laid before us a statement showing that the proposed increase in dock charges would add 1.18d. per tonto the Board&apos;s cost on coal for export and Foreign bunkers and would add1.17d. per ton to the cost of coal borne coastwise, coastwise bunkers andtrawler bunkers. And their submission was that in so far as increases hadto be made in transport charges which would fall on coal class traffic, theyshould be mitigated as far as possible.The British Electricity Authority made no representation with respect toDock charges.On behalf of the Hull Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shippingit was submitted that instead of an all-round percentage increase of dockdues and charges, it would be better to make selective increases by agreementwith the interests concerned.The Hull Fishing Vessel Owners&apos; Association, Limited, submitted that theproposed increase in dock charges would have a serious effect on the fishing industry and might disrupt it altogether.Sir Robert Letch&apos;s evidence in addition to explaining and amplifying the documents laid before us, was, on the principal matters discussed including those raised by the parties appearing, to the following effect 1. EfficiencyThat efficiency in the case of docks is attained not solely by the efforts of the Port Authority and their staff but by the work of a team comprising the Port Authority and its staff, the Shipowners, the Importers and Exportersand the Trade Unions. That consultative machinery had been devised withShipowners, Importers, Exporters and the Trade Unions at the ports underthe Commission^ control to study individual operations, mechanisation andadaptations of all sorts to increase the productivity of the workers and to expedite operations.That the real test of efficiency was how long a ship has to stay in portto discharge and load cargoes, and that in regard to that, there has been animprovement in the last two years, an improvement up to 10 per cent, atsome of the Commission^ ports and a greater improvement at others, andfurther, that in those years there has undoubtedly been an increase in the productivity of dock workers.That the Commission as Dock Administrators are collaborating withShipowners, Importers, Exporters and Trade Union Leaders in a study of methods to improve the efficiency of ports, and that many proposals are under consideration at the various ports designed to improve efficiency andthat this is a continuing process.That it is the policy of the Commission to include in dock administration the practical area required for dock purposes and not to regard as docks thearea which may have been so defined by statutory provision. That the areasnow regarded as docks are more extensive than the statutory areas, and thatit has not been found possible to relate the staff in the present dock areas with the pre-war dock staff. That there was a small reduction in staff in1949 compared with the two previous years, during which time there had beena progressive increase in the traffic dealt with, but it was not suggestedthat there was any close connection between the permanent staff employed bythe Commission and the traffic passing through the docks.568118 A 2

112. Comparison with Surcharges at Other PortsThat the general level of surcharges on the pre-war actual charges at united Kingdom Ports other than those of the Commission, was in most cases in excess of the surcharges now in force at Commission Ports, and that those now proposed by the Commission will bring them more into relation withthe surcharges in force at other ports, but still materially less than those oncoastwise traffic in force at such ports.In considering the relationship between the increases at the Commissionports and other ports, an important fact has to be borne in mind, namely:before the war the charges in operation at the latter ports were fullyeconomic, being on a level to meet the operating and maintenance costs andto provide a surplus to enable the Port Authority to pay interest and othercapital charges, whereas the charges at. what are now the Commission^ports were not economic in that they did not provide a margin after paying for operating and maintenance costs sufficient to meet the capital charges ofthe undertaking. That before the war the surplus of revenue over operatingand maintenance costs was in consequence of uneconomic base rates,equivalent to only 85 per cent, on the capital expended on the RailwayDocks.That a greater surcharge is required to be applied to uneconomic baserates if the pre-war position is to be restored than is required where the base rates are economic.3. Coastwise Differential and Inclusion of EireThat in regard to the question of a differential in the surcharge in favourof coastwise traffic, that at all ports or practically all ports other than theCommission ports there is in the basic dues on vessels and also on goodsa differential in favour of coastwise traffic and that except in the case ofLeith and Dundee, no further differential had been accorded by imposing a lower surcharge on coastal traffic than on other traffic. That in thecase of the Commission ports the basic dues on coastal vessels were one-fourthor one-fifth of the rate on overseas vessels, but as regards goods, the basic rates contained no differential in favour of coastwise goods except at Barrow.That upon these facts, that while there was no valid reason for a differentialin the surcharge on coastal vessels, the absence of any differential in the basic rates on goods justified some differential in the surcharge on goods,and the Commission regarded their proposal for a 50 per cent, surcharge on coastal vessels and goods and a 100 per cent, surcharge in the case ofall other dues as reasonable in all the circumstances.That the Commission considered that the inclusion of Eire within the range of coasting shipping as pressed for by the Chamber of Shipping was a concession that might be extended to the coasting trade.4. CoalThat taking the Commission^ docks as a whole, there was no doubt thatthe operating costs incurred by the Commission in connection with coalshipments far exceeded the revenue that they derive from the coal trade ;the trade does involve the Commission at present rates in a substantial loss,and that the Commission^ proposals will not redress the adverse balance.5. The Hull RepresentationThat the suggestion made by the Hull Incorporated Chamber of commerce and Shipping, that the all-round percentage method of increase was unsoundand should be abandoned in favour of a system of selective increases by

agreement with the interests concerned, would not enable the Commissionto secure any additional revenue for a considerable time. Negotiations wouldbe necessary in respect of hundreds and possibly thousands of rates, wouldbe a prolonged process, and if agreement were ultimately reached the pro-cedure laid down by the Transport Act would still have to be followed sincethe charges are statutory and cannot by agreement be increased beyondthe present statutory. limits.6. The Trawlers&apos; RepresentationThat in reference to the representation of the Hull Fishing Vessel Owners&apos;Association, that the Commission^ proposals should be rejected, it was estimated that the Fishing Docks at Grimsby and Fleetwood for every  1of revenue received in dock charges on Trawlers and Fish, the Commissionspent  1 14s. to  1 16s. in maintaining and operating the ports andthat at Hull the position was worse. That the Commission^ proposals would increase their revenue by about 3s. and would still leave them with a heavyworking loss on the fishing fleet.FART IICANALS AND INLAND WATERWAYSThe waterways of the Commission are the canals and inland waterwaysmentioned in Part II of the Third Schedule of the Transport Act, 1947, andthe canals formerly owned by the Railway Companies; they comprise mostof the important waterways of the country, the principal exceptions beingthe Manchester Ship Canal, the Bridgwater Canal and certain navigablerivers.The record of the originating tonnage on which tolls are paid shows thatthe traffic passing along these waterways in 1947, 1948 and 1949 is sub-stantially less than in 193&apos;8, the tonnage percentage of 1938 being in 1947,78.8, in 1948, 86.7 and estimated for 1949, 86.4.The working expenses of the waterways exceeded the gross receipts in 1948by  300,000, in 1949 by  400,000 and it is estimated that in 1950 the excesswill again be  400,000 ; the true deficits being for each of the said yearssome  500,000 more, that sum being what the Commission regards as a fair and reasonable apportionment of the central charges.The Commission by their proposal seek your authority to increase thepresent statutory charges by 16f per cent., thus maintaining in view of their proposal with respect to railway charges, the existing relationship with rail-way freight charges.The revenue of the Commission with which we are concerned is that derivedfrom statutory charges, being the tolls levied on the waterways and the changes made for their own carrying operations. The statutory tolls to which theproposed increases would apply as estimated for 1950 total  822,000. Thesetolls at present are at varying levels up to 50 per cent, above pre-war. Thetotal estimated revenue for 1950 from the Commission^ own carrying opera-tions arising from statutory freight charges is  259,000. These charges atpresent being at different levels up to 55 per cent, above pre-war.It is estimated that the net yield from the proposed increases in a futureyear will in the case of tolls amount to approximately  80,000 and in thecase of the Commission^ carrying activities to  20,000. The yield from theproposed increases will therefore fall substantially short of the amount requiredto eliminate the estimated working deficit and all that it is expected to achieve is to reduce the deficit to the figure of  300.000 at which it stood in 1*48.

11The Chamber of Shipping and the Traders&apos; Dock and Harbour Co-ordinating Committee made no representations upon the Commission^ pro-posals with respect to canal charges.The National Coal Board supplied us with a statement based on 1949showing, as regards Canal Tolls, on the assumption that the maximum in-crease of 16f per cent, is generally applied, that the increased cost (i) tothe Board on export coal and foreign bunkers would be 6.86d. per ton, (ii) to consumers on coal carried by canal to inland destinations would be -2.3d. perton, and (iii) to consumers on coal to ports for shipment as coastwise cargoand bunkers and trawler bunkers would be 8.49d. per ton.The Board made no criticism of the Commission^ conduct of their CanalUndertakings and their attitude to the Commission^ proposal was that towhich we have referred in Part I of this Report, namely, that regard beinghad to the prime importance of coal in the economy of the country, it is inthe public interest that if any increases have to be granted in transport charges falling to coal, such increases should be mitigated as far as possible.The British Electricity Authority are probably the largest single users ofcanal transport. Their estimated tonnage carried by canal being some-J- million tons a year, and if the proposed 16J per cent, increase is appliedto the whole of this traffic, the additional cost to them will be some  11,000.They directed our attention to and adopted in regard to the canal proposaltheir submissions made upon the proposed increase of railway charges referredto in our earlier Report, and asked us to consider whether in the proposalfor canal tolls there could not be given to coal traffic some form ofdifferential. It was also suggested on behalf of the Authority that considera-tion should be given to a long-term policy of reducing canal tolls in orderto attract traffic and resuscitate the canals.The Hull Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping represented that the proposed increase in canal tolls would bear particularly heavily onthe Hull area, which makes great use of this form of transport in order to overcome its other geographical disadvantages, and submitted that theproposal should not be proceeded with.The evidence of Sir Robert Letch on behalf of the Commission was to thefollowing effect:  &apos;1. That the gross receipts were  2,168,000 in 1948,  2,394,000 in 1949 and estimated for 1950  2,413,000 at existing charges.2. That in 1948 an operating loss of  300,000 was incurred ; that for 1949 theloss is estimated at  400,000 and the same loss is estimated for 1950 at existingcharges- the increase in the operating loss in 1949 being due in large part tothe Commission having extended their carrying operations, by the integration of subsidiary companies and by the acquisition of the craft of certain private firms, the rates for such carrying operations being unremunerative.3. That the intention is, if the Commission^ proposals are accepted, toapp&apos;ly the 16 2-3 per cent, in full wherever it is practicable, but that from a survey of the trades with which they are concerned and having in mind theirpast inability to apply authorised increases generally, they are satisfied thatthey will not be able now to apply the full increase generally and retain the traffic ; that it is not anticipated that the net yield from the increase proposedwill exceed over all 10 per cent, on the estimated traffic of 1950 and thatmay be an optimistic forecast.That railway rates are the CanaFs limiting factor ; if canal charges goabove railway charges, traffic will leave the canals, long distance traffic will go by rail and short distance by road, and as a considerable part of the coal

passing by canal is short distance, road haulage is an effective competitorand a significant traffic which has left the canals is now carried by roadat rates with which the private canal carrier cannot compete.4. That upwards of 70 per cent, of the carrying on the canals is performed by private firms who pay the Commission a toll but are free themselves to charge whatever rates they can. The Commission, however, must of necessity have regard to the economics of the private carrier by considering whether it is possible for them to pay the full tolls and retain the traffic. Ifthey cannot pay the full tolls and retain the business, the Commission mustbe prepared to meet them as far as they can or let the traffic go from the canals.5. That in 1949 there had been an increase over 1948 of a little under per cent, in the staff employed ; that where possible a reduction of staff hadbeen effected by re-organisation, and that the overall increase resulted fromendeavouring to overtake arrears of maintenance, carrying out by direct labour capital works of improvement, and the expansion of carrying opera-tions involving the taking over of additional boats, and the boatmen, boat-builders and administrative staff of the firms whose boats were acquired.6. That, in regard to the representation of the Hull Chamber of commerce and Shipping, it is anticipated that the toll increase on the whole system willon average amount to 1.7d. per ton and that such an increase will not affectthe movement of traffic to and from Hull.PART IIICONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSUpon the evidence before us there is no ground for thinking that there is any lack of efficiency in the conduct of the Commission^ Dock or inland waterways Undertakings. No suggestion of any such lack of efficiency wasmade in any of the representations made to us neither was any suggestion made that the working deficits anticipated in 1950 were over estimated or that such deficits might be reduced by additional economies and we have no ground for thinking that additional economies can now be effected to securethat end in the immediate future.The representations made to us apart from those on behalf of coastal shipping were almost entirely based upon the additional cost that the accept-ance of the Commission^ proposals would cast upon those using the dock and Waterways services of the Commission and the necessity in the publicinterest of keeping transport charges at the lowest possible level. As regardsthe desirability of keeping down prices in view of the present economicnecessities of the Country the evidence, referred to in our report of 6thFebruary upon the Commission^ proposals in respect of their railway services,is applicable to the present proposals. Nevertheless, bearing in rnind theStatutory obligations of the Commission, their need for additional revenue and that their Dock and Inland Waterways are sources from which some additional revenue can be obtained if additional charges are authorised, weare of opinion that the additional charges sought to be made should beauthorised.With regard to the submission of the Chamber of Shipping and the Traders&apos;Dock and Harbour Co-ordinating Committee that ports in Eire should beincluded in the voyages mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Part II of theCommission^ Application relating to their Harbours, Docks and Piers, sothat Coastal vessels when trading with Eire may obtain the benefit of the differential rates proposed in the said paragraphs ; we think this is a request

116which should be granted and indeed we were informed that the commission would v/elcome Eire being brought into the definition of Coastwise Shippingif we so recommended.,The complaint of the coasting trade to the proposal to increase the surcharge on coasting vessels and cargoes to 50 per cent, was not based so much, if at all, on the increased cost to the coasting trade, as on the fact that theeffect of this surcharge is to increase the present coastwise charges by 20 percent., whereas the effect of the proposed surcharge of 100 per cent, on other vessels and cargoes is to increase the present charges by&apos;only 14.3 percent.We have carefully considered this matter and have come to the conclusionthat the practical way to approach it is to consider the difference betweenthe charges paid on coastwise traffic and on other traffic. Looked at inthis way, it will be seen that if the 50 per cent, surcharge is applied to the basic coastwise charges and 100 per cent, to the basic charges on othertraffic, the relation between the charges paid on coastwise traffic and othertraffic is the same as the relation which the Charges Consultative Committeeadvised in their Report of the 15th November, 1946. We think that relationis a proper one and we do not recommend any reduction in the 50 percent, surcharge proposed in respect of coastwise traffic.We accordingly advise that the appropriate regulations under Section 82of the Transport Act, 1947, should be made authorising the Commission tomake in respect of the services and facilities provided (i) At their Harbours, Docks and Piers, the charges for which areregulated by Statutory provisions (as defined in the said Act) the addi-tional charges specified in Part II of the Schedule of the Commission^Application to you subject to the addition of &quot; Eire &quot; in paragraphs 2and 3 thereof after the words &quot; the Isle of Man &quot;.(ii) On their Canals and Inland Waterways the charges for which areregulated by Statutory provisions (as defined in the said Act) the addi-tional charge mentioned in the Commission^ application to you.Bruce Thomas.Herbert E.
