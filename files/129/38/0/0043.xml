Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRETCP. (50) 4323rd March, 1950CABINETDECARTELISATION  AND  REORGANISATION   OF   THE   german coal,  IRON AND STEEL industries memorandum: by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsStatement of Problem1. My colleagues will remember that in November, 1948, a law was approvedby the Military Governors of the British and United States Zones of Germany forthe deconcentration and reorganisation of the German coal and iron and steel industries (Military Government Law 75). This law was not unsatisfactoryin itself. The preamble, which represented a considerable victory over theAmerican point of view, left the decision on the ownership of the industries inquestion to the future German Government. Apparently adequate provision wasmade for breaking up all the large combines, and for a plan of reorganisationover the whole industry which could include the coal and steel assets of all theprincipal companies outside the combines.2. Implementation of the law of November, 1948, has been very largely held up in the British and United States Zones of Germany as a result of differences of view between General Clay and General Robertson on the procedure to befollowed and on the scope of the reorganisation of the coal industry in particular.The United States authorities attempted, in the operation of the law, to exclude the independent coal companies, no doubt from fear that to include them mighttend to serve as a pointer towards public rather than private ownership.3. With the formation of the High Commission and the Federal Govern-ment covering the whole of Western Germany including the French Zone, law 75had to come up for revision and agreement with the French. Discussions havebeen proceeding since the New Year, and the United States representatives haveshown themselves anxious to obtain substantial revision of the original law. Atthe same time a major difficulty has arisen on the French side, in that the french have hitherto constantly refused to accept a preamble embodying the principlethat the German Government is free to determine the form of ownership in thecoal and iron and steel industries. As a result of prolonged and detailed discussion at the official level, a revised version of law 75 has now been submittedto the Council of the High Commission in Germany for approval.4. I have been giving very careful consideration to the new draft beforesending instructions to the United Kingdom High Commissioner on the attitude which he should take in discussions with his colleagues. Considerable changes of form have been made in the text of the new law, but I am satisfied that in mainthe principles governing the old law have been maintained and the procedure hasnot been radically altered. Subject to one exception discussed in detail below,there is adequate provision for the liquidation of the main combines in the coal and iron and steel industries, and for reorganisation covering almost the entirefield of these industries and including the assets of all important companiesoutside the main combines.38458Copy No.    3
Questions at Issue(a) Ownership - \5. On the main question of ownership we have hopes of a satisfactory solution. The United States authorities, somewhat reluctantly, have reaffirmedthe earlier Anglo-American decision that the question of ownership should beleft for decision to the German Government. The French High Commissionerhas indicated that, while he will wish to record&apos; formally his objection to thedecision on ownership of the coal and iron and steel industries by the federal government, he will probably abide by a majority decision. This would have theeffect of making the decision on ownership applicable to all three Zones of western Germany. A recent approach from the French Embassy suggests thatthe French Government may yet have second thoughts on this question, but Ibelieve that, if faced with a firm Anglo-American front, they will in the last resort give way. General Robertson is, of course, aware that this is a point onwhich there can be no compromise.(b) Other Matters6. The main differences between the new and the old law concern the scopeof liquidation, the procedure to be followed in liquidation, the treatment of claims and interests, and the judicial review of certain aspects of compensation.Except on the first of these, I regard the proposed changes as, in some cases, animprovement, and, in all cases, acceptable.(i) Scope of Liquidation7. The United States authorities wish to remove three firms from the listof those which are definitely scheduled for liquidation and to transfer them tothe list of those whose assets and properties may at best be included in the plans for reorganisation which are being prepared. The firms concerned are Stinnes,Thyssen Bornemisza and Ilseder Hiitte, which are among the smaller combines,the United States authorities giving as the reason for their proposal that these three firms are not excessive concentrations of economic power. In the case ofStinnes, which was included in the original law on United States insistence, thereal motive is probably pressure from the American financial interests involved.The other two firms have probably been added in order to make the reversal ofpolicy in the case of Stinnes less obvious. The practical effect of this proposal might be to exclude these firms from the scope of the law, thus leaving aconsiderable gap in the reorganisation of the industries. More important,however, would be the psychological and political effect of a change for whichthere appears to be no justification except American second thoughts. by including these firms in the original list for liquidation, the United States and united Kingdom Military Governors committed themselves to the view that theywere excessive concentrations of economic power. Nothing has, in fact, happened to change this view and their omission now would give rise to unwarrantedsuspicion in Germany and elsewhere that we were modifying our policy towardsGerman industrial complexes. The High Commissioner has expressed the viewthat the Americans are not likely to give way on this point, but I have, neverthe-less, instructed him to stand firm on the retention of these concerns in the listfor definite liquidation. I should be grateful for an expression of the views ofmy colleagues on this matter, since I am advised that we may be faced with the alternatives of making some concession, or losing the law altogether.(ii) Procedure for Liquidation8. The Ameri cans have been reluctant to provide for the mandatoryappointment of liquidators for those firms which are scheduled for liquidation,on the grounds that the objects of the law could, in some cases, be attained by theremoval of the assets of the firm and its dissolution without any formal liquidation.Again we have felt that any weakening on the mandatory appointment ofliquidators, such as was provided in the old law, might give rise to suspicionsabout our intentions of dealing firmly with the objectionable combines. GeneralEobertson has, however, suggested a formula which, he believes, his United Statescolleague could accept, which will provide that liquidators will be appointedwithin three months except in cases where the Council decides otherwise. Iconsider that this arrangement, which ensures liquidation in all cases, would be satisfactory.
(iii) Treatment of Claims and Interests9. The Article covering this point in the old law was unsatisfactory and wassubjected to severe and justified criticism from the foreign (including British)creditors of the Companies due for liquidation and reorganisation. The relevantarticle in the new law has been amended and considerably improved. these changes may not give the creditors all they would desire, but I consider that theyshould no longer nave any legitimate grievance.(iv) Judicial Review10. The new draft provides for the establishment of a judicial Board ofBeview to deal with certain questions arising from the compensation accorded to creditors and shareholders of Companies due for liquidation and reorganisation.I regard this as a useful piece of machinery for dealing with claims from aggrievedparties.Conclusion11. As a result of the delays in implementing law 75 over the past year theneed for agreement on a revised law has become imperative. The Germans havealready given signs of desiring to take over the responsibility for reorganisationthemselves. If they were to do so, it is very doubtful how far any useful measuresof deconcentration and reorganisation would be achieved. They have been keptquiet for the moment by being told that the High Commission is about to agree a new law. If agreement is delayed we must expect an increase in german resistance and obstruction, extending to those German bodies which under the laware charged with preparing and submitting to the High Commission detailed plans for the reorganisation. Without their co-operation, which we can still hope toobtain if the law is approved in the near future, thy whole procedure will be frustrated. The United States authorities for their part are now anxious to presson with the reorganisation of the industries. Although we still do not see eyeto eye with them on all points regarding the implementation of the law, I believethat the present draft provides as good a foundation from which to argue our case as we are likely to get. Any further delay in approving it might well bring aboutanother of the frequent changes in United States policy, and even our presentagreed objectives would thus be jeopardised.Recommendation12. .In these circumstances I would seek the&quot; approval of my colleagues forauthorising General Robertson to agree to the revised law a-s it now stands, subjectto a satisfactory arrangement in respect of Stinnes, Thyssen Bornemisza andIlseder Hutte (paragraph 7).E.
