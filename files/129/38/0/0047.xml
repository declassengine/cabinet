(50) 4724th March, 1950CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report(CP. (49) 247).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,24th March, 1950.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the total working population increased by 133,000 in 1949; a rise of only15,000 was forecast in the Economic Survey for 1949. The increase was due mainly to the fact that the number of women who remained in or took up work was larger than had been expected. In January 1950 there was a. further rise of 52,000 due mainly to the number of children joining the working population on leaving school. There was a seasonal rise in unemployment during January,but the total number in civil employment rose by 43,000 (33,000 men and 10,000women) to 22-26 million a figure only previously exceeded by that for the endof November 1949.2. The total employed in manufacturing industries increased in Januaryby 38,000. Metals, engineering and vehicles gained 16,000, clothing 10,000, andtextiles 9,000. Changes in the basic industries were smalj,: but included a fall of 2,000 in the total man-power engaged in coalmining.3. The distributive trades lost 9,000 which may be attributed to seasonalcauses. In the professional, financial and miscellaneous, groups, there was a rise of 8,000 against a fall of 7,000 in the previous month.4. The number of persons registered as: unemployed rose slightly from372,266 at J6th January to 372,782 at 13th February. This, compares with360,300 at 14th February, 1949. Both figures this year represent a rate of about1-8 per cent, of the total number of employees insured under.; the National&quot;Insurance schemes. Unemployment in the Development Areas rose from 1447200at 16th January to. 144,400 at 13th February, the&apos;figures representing, a rate, ofabout 4 per cent. - ^ . .-    - -     - -
5. At the middle of February the number of vacancies remaining unfilledon the books of the Employment Exchanges, other Local Offices of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, and the Youth Employment Offices of certain LocalAuthorities, was 348,363. This compares with the figure of 372,782 unemployed persons. At this time of the year the number of vacancies tends to be seasonallylow and unemployment seasonally high.6. Some considerable proportion of the unemployment and of the vacanciesunfilled can be explained by the time lag between leaving one job and taking upanother.  Two-thirds of the unfilled vacancies are for women and juveniles.Vacancies and Unemployment in February 1950Great Britain (Thousands)Total Men Boys Women GirlsUnfilled vacancies       ...... 348 11,9 46 118 65Unemployed     ......      ... 373 258 8 99 87. International comparisons of employment and unemployment conditionscannot be made with any degree of accuracy owing to the different methods usedin compiling and defining the statistics. Nevertheless, a broad comparison canbe made between the rates of 1 - 8 per cent, insured persons unemployed in GreatBritain and 4 per cent, for the Development Areas, and the rates for NorthernIreland and the United States. Out of an estimated number of insured personsin Northern Ireland (at July 1948) of 470,000, the numbers unemployed inJanuary 1950 are given as 31,617 representing a rate of 6-7 per cent. In theUnited States, the civilian labour force in January is estimated as 61,427,000, pfwhich 4,480,000 were unemployed. Unemployment in the United States as a percentage of employees only is estimated at 8 per cent.II. Production8. The index of total industrial production (1946 - 100) rose to 137 inJanuary 13 points greater than in January 1949. The general trend continuesto rise steadily.9. The average level for the last half of 1949 was 129 or 8 points more thanthe index for the second half of 1948. The rate of increase during 1949 was due mainly to the rapid expansion of production in the engineering industries and in particular to increased production of vehicles, for which the index rose from 124 in the last half of 1948 to 154 in the last half of 1949. It is not to beexpected that vehicle production can continue to expand at this rate.Interim Index of Industrial Production(Average 1946 = 100)Total all industries     ............:, Mining and quarrying......      ......Building and contracting      .........Gas, electricity and water      ...      ......Manufacturing industries Total ...      .........Metal manufactureEngineering, shipbuilding and electricalgoods...............Vehicles     ...............Chemicals, &amp;c..........      ...Textile and clothing       .........Food, drink and tobacco ......Coal10. Output of deep-mined coal in 1949 was 3-2 per cent, greater than in1948 and in December 1949 and January 1950 taken together was 3 - 5 per cent.Second half	Second half1948	1949121	129108	112122	-    130107	110123	132114	117135	138124	154120	121120	129112	114
greater than in the corresponding two months of the winter of 1948-49. Out-put rose after the Christmas and New Year holidays to an average of 4-13milhon tons in February, but this was only 1 per cent, greater than in February11. Output per man shift continues to rise slowly but steadily. In Februaryit was 1 - 20 tons per man shift overall, compared with an average of 1-17 tonsin the years 1935 to 1938.12. The decline in man-power continues. The total number of workers onthe colliery books was 704,800 at 11th March--a fall of 22,000 since March 1949.The number of face workers on the colliery books has fallen from 299,000 to291,000 in the same period.13. . Total absenteeism during the first ten weeks of 1950 has averaged12-72 per cent, compared with 12; 83i per cent, during the corresponding periodof last year. Involuntary absence is higher than last year but voluntary absencehas been lower (5 -18 per cent, compared with 5:69 per cent.).Iron and Steel14. Production of steel ingots and castings rose to an average of 325,000 tonsa week in February and to a new record of 336,000 tons in the second week ofMarch. Total output during 1949 amounted to 15,553,000 tons and it is expectedthat output during 1950 will rise to between 15f and16 million tons.15. Stocks of both pig-iron and scrap declined in February but are still very substantially greater than in February of last year.Textiles&apos;. 16., Textile production in January made a good recovery after the holidays.Compared with January 1949 deliveries of cotton yarn, rayon yarn, worsted yarnand woven wool fabrics all showed a greater percentage rise than the increase between 1948 and 1949. Output of rayon yarn was 38 per cent, greater than inJanuary 1949. . Production of woven cotton and rayon fabrics, however, shows no improvement on the rate of increase of 8 per cent, a year.Percentage Change in OutputYears January1948 to 1949 to1949 January 1950Cotton and spun rayon and mixture yarns...      4-4-8 -K 7-3Rayon yarns and staple fibre...      ...      ...      -f23-6 -1-38-5Woven cotton and rayon fabrics    ...      ,..      4- 8-0 4-&apos; 8*1Worsted yarn.........      ...      ...      rf 7-4 +12-9Woven wool fabrics    .........      ...      -f 5-8 4- 9*4Motor vehicles17. The number of passenger cars produced rose to a new record level of10,174 a week in February. The number of these produced for export increasedto 8,155 a week compared with an average of 5,234 a week in 1949. The home market received 2,019 a week in February compared with an average of 2,694 aweek in 1949.18. The value of exports of all passenger cars (including chassis) rose to ahew record of  8-99 million in January and to  10-03 million in February.Exports to Canada increased sharply to  1J million in January and February, butshipments to the United States declined to an average of  194,000 a monthcompared with a monthly average of  276,000 in the last quarter of 1949 and anaverage of  634,000 in the last quarter of 1948.......

Production of commercial vehicles rose in February to a record level of5,158 a week and the number produced for export increased to a new record of3,298 a week. This increase was confined to the smaller vehicles with a carrying capacity of 6 tons or less.Merchant shipping20. The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction declined further inFebruary to 1,803,000 tons. This compares with 1,986,000 tons under construction in February 1949. The tonnage of tankers under construction has risen from645,000 tons in February 1949 to 855,000 tons in February 1950, while the tonnageof other vessels (of 1,600 gross tons and over) has declined in the same period from 1,240,000 to 885,000 tons. New orders for merchant vessels rose sharplyin February to 171,000 tons. This compares with a total of new orders of 331,000tons in the whole of 1949. Most of the ships ordered in February are for Britishowners.21. The tonnage of vessels undergoing repair and conversion, which fell to2-44 million tons at the end of 1949, rose to 2-61 million tons at the end ofFebruary.III. External Trade22. The value of United Kingdom exports reached the highest level everrecorded ( 175-9 million) in January. The volume of exports also rose to a newrecord level of about 175 per cent, of the volume in 1938.23. The value of imports in January ( 201-2 million) was only slightlybelow the record figure for June 1949.24. Exports of metal goods, which rose from a monthly average of  78-million in the last quarter of 1949 to  91-7 million in January were mainly responsible for the increased value of exports. Over half of the increase in exportsof vehicles ( 35 - 4 million in January compared with an average of  29 - 0 million in the fourth quarter of 1949) was due to exceptionally high exports of ships andboats which are always subject to great variations from month to month. Exportsof textiles rose to  31 - 3 million in January only slightly more than the averageof  30-0 million in 1949.25. In the shorter month of February, imports fell to  181-7 million and.exports to  155-8 million. This compares with imports of  162-0 million and exports of  140-7 million in February 1949.26. Exports to the Western Hemisphere rose to  29-3 million in January,and this represented 16-7 per cent, of total United Kingdom exports in themonth the same proportion as in January 1949. Exports to the United Statesamounted to  6-9 million in January and to  6-3 million in February comparedwith  7-2 million in December. Exports to Canada, however, increased from 7-6 to  8-4 million in January and: were  8-0 million in February. In terms of dollars, exports to the United States were lower in January and February 1950than in the corresponding months of 1949, but exports to Canada were greater.

Balance of Payments27.   In 1949 our gold and dollar deficit was as follows :-Net Gold and Dollar Deficit^)(United States % million)Deficit26485345Surplus567243Devaluation17205(b)1161153420318th SeptemberWeekly averages: 1949 1st quarter 2nd Quarter3rd Quarter JulyAugustWeek ended: September 3   ...10 ...17   ...24   ...October     14th   Quarter October   8152229November 5121926December 310172431(a) Met by drawings on the Canadian Credit and the International Monetary Fund, byassistance under the European Recovery Programme and by drafts on our gold and dollarholdings.(b) Including a debit of 20 to Australia (drawings on I.M.F. paid directly into her dollarbalances).28. By the end of the year the gold and dollar reserves had been rebuilt to$1,688 million, from $1,340 million on 17th September and $1,425 million on30th September. The net gold and dollar deficit was $539 million in the thirdquarter of 1949 and $31 million in the fourth. This was a result partly of abnormal factors following devaluation, and partly of recovery in the Americanbusiness situation. The latter, which has continued into 1950, has meant both that united States importers have been rebuilding stocks of sterling area goods, andthat the prices received have been satisfactory. The effect of this stock rebuildingis inevitably temporary, and when it comes to an end receipts from rest of sterling area primary commodities will decline even if the higher prices persist. More-over, receipts from wool and cocoa have been seasonally high.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer will be making an oral statement to his colleaguesregarding the more recent course of: (i) The net gold and dollar deficit;(ii) The changes in the United Kingdom gold and dollar holdings;(Hi)  Reserves and liabilities.General Balance of Payments29. After deteriorating in the summer of 1949, the United Kingdom&apos;s totalbalance of payments improved and was probably running in surplus at the turnof the year. This stronger tendency has been confirmed by the January and february trade figures.Movement of Sterling Liabilities30. In the first half of 1949 there was a downward movement, caused by thehigh rate of United Kingdom exports, aided by some capital reflux from SouthAfrica. This downward movement was reversed in the third quarter, whennon-sterling area residents tended: to defer payments to the sterling area in the expectation of devaluation, while sterling area residents tended to accelerate their payments to the non-sterling area. As there was an incentive to private holders of sterling abroad (including foreign commercialbanks) not to hold more than a minimum working balance, they sold sterlingso far as possible to their Central Banks. In the case of Belgium and switzerland, in particular, this led to increased gold payments by the UnitedKingdom in repurchase of sterling in excess of the gold points in the Agreements.(In the case of the American Accounts, sterling could be used directly to purchasedollars from the United Kingdom, and this happened to a limited extent.)31. After devaluation these movements in the non-sterling area werereversed, and sterling holdings by central banks fell, thus relieving the pressure on the gold points. Private and commercial holdings of sterling were built up,however, leading, in the case of American Accounts, to a sharp influx of dollars.The total liabilities to non-sterling countries were increased by revaluation pay-ments, mainly in September to November, of  60 million.32. There has also been an increase in the sterling holdings of sterling area countries.  This reflects not only the continued movement of funds to Australia
and the resumption of movements to South Africa, but also a striking changein the balance of payments of India, following her import cuts last summer, andbuoyancy of income of all producers of raw materials (e.g., in Australia and theColonies).V. Stocks33. The index of volume of stocks of food and feeding-stuffs, raw materials and petroleum products (December 1947 = 100) has fallen slowly from 109 inSeptember 1949 to 105 at the end of the year, when it was 8 points above the level at the end of 1948. The index of stocks of raw materials has fallen back from101 in September to 94 in December-about the same level as in December 1948.The index of food and feeding-stuffs, however, after rising from 98 in December1948 to 113 in September, increased further to 116 at the end of the year. Overthe whole year 1949 the value of all these stocks (at December 1948 prices) roseby about  55 million, of which  44 million represented food and feeding-stuffs.Incle-x of volume^) of stocks in the United Kingdom(December 1947 = 100)Food and Raw PetroleumTotal               feeding-stuffs materials products1948 December          ...            97                        98 93                   1491949 September          ...           109                      113 101                    173December          ...           105                      116 94                   164(*) Quantities revalued at December 1948 prices.YI. Prices and FinanceImport and Export Prices34. The index of import prices (1947 = 100), which fell sharply from 116in April to 110 in September, rose substantially in October, after devaluation,to 118 and increased further to 124 in January and to 125 in February. After the increases in January there was little change in February in the prices of dollarcommodities and, with the exception of rubber, there was a halt in the risingsterling prices of most non-dollar commodities. American cotton prices continuedto rise, but there was a marked fall in Brazilian and Egyptian cotton prices.35. The index of export prices remained constant during the first ten monthsof the year but has increased from 113 in October to 116 in February.Wholesale Prices36. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices (1938 = 100) rose to242 in February. Compared with February 1949 the index of all articles has risen by 10-9 per cent. The biggest increases over these 12 months have been for cereals, wheat (31-3 per cent.); meat, fish and eggs (25-0 per cent.); cotton(16-7 per cent.) and wool (28-0 per cent.).Retail Prices37. The index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100), which rose from 112 inSeptember 1949 to 113 in December, remained unchanged in January and february.38. The index of food prices rose from 117 in September to 120 in december and to 121 in February.Savings39. During 1949 new small savings fell short of withdrawals by  58 million this compared with an excess of new savings over withdrawals of  46 million in 1948 and  206 million in 1947. In the first eight weeks of this year the excesswas only  10 million compared with an excess of  38 million in the correspondingperiod of 1949.

Wage Rates and Earnings40.   The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947= 100), which has been unchanged at 109 during the last half of 1949, rose to 110 in January a rise of two points over the year.41. During 1949 about 5-2 million workers secured increases in wage rates which added approximately  1 - 07 million to the weekly wage bill. This comparesAvith an addition of  1-90 million to the weekly wages of 7-76 million workersin 1948. About three-fifths of this rise in 1949 was accounted for by increases to workers employed in agriculture, textile manufacture, building and contracting,transport and communications and the distributive trades. About 11 per cent,of the increase of  1 - 07 million a week was effected under sliding scales based onthe index of retail prices and about 33 per cent, by Wages Councils and other statutory Wages Boards.42. In January there was an increase of about  106,000 in the weekly wages of 438,000 workpeople and in February an increase of  178,000 in the weeklywages of about 1,378,000 workers. Most of this rise in February was accountedfor by the increase in the building industry under the cost of living agreement.43. Important claims still outstanding are those in railways, engineering and shipbuilding and coalmining industries. New proposals were presented inDecember by the National Union of Railwaymen for improvements in the pay of lower-paid workers based upon a  5 minimum adult wage per male worker.These have been rejected by the Railway Executive and the Union has decidedto refer them to the Railway Staffs&apos; National Council.44. Three claims for new scales of pay affecting National Health Serviceemployees have been made. Nursing Assistants, Public Health Medical Officersand some grades of hospital technicians are affected.45. It has been announced that the National Union of Teachers and other organisations of school teachers will open negotiations next month under the burnham Committee procedure for new salary scales, which will probably involvea&apos;general increase of about  150 per annum.; 46. The results of the Ministry of Labouhs enquiry into weekly earnings in manufacturing and certain other industries in October 1949 are now available.Average weekly earnings of men (aged 21 and over) including bonus, overtime,&amp;c, and before deduction of income tax or insurance contributions, amounted to142s. 8d... or 107 per cent, more than in October 1938&apos;. This represented a rise of 4s. 9cZ. a week compared with October 1948 or about half the increase of 9s. lOd.a week between October 1947 and October 1948. Average, hours (includingovertime) worked have increased slightly from 46-6 a week iri October 1947 to46 -8 in October 1949.   This compared with 47-7 hours a week in October 1938.Liberalisation of Trade47. Under the decision of the Council of the Organisation for european economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) of 2nd November, 1949 (CP. (49) 225, para-graph 50), participating countries agreed to free from quantitative restrictionsat least 50 per cent, of their private account imports from other O.E.E.C. countriesEarningsVIII. European Recovery Programme
as a group in each of the three main categories of imports taken separately (food and feeding-stuffSj raw materials and manufactured goods), and to report their proposals by 15th December, 1949.48. Most of the more important member-countries of 0:E.E.C. achieved the objective of 50 per cent. (Germany and Denmark were among those which didnot.) In a decision of the Council taken on 31st January, 1950, it was further agreed that participatory countries should, subject to the implementation of asatisfactory payments scheme (i) make it their aim, as: soon as such payments scheme comes; into.&apos;force, to remove quantitative restrictions on at least 60 per cent, oftheir imports on private account in the three main categories of goods;(ii) consider after 30th June, 1950; what further progress could be madfe-during 1950 to attain 75 per cent, liberalisation on imports from otherparticipants taken as a group.49. At the same time participants agreed to examine the possibility offreeing transactions in the &quot; invisible &quot; items of trade and; of- taking steps towards removing other difficulties arising from tariff difficulties, quotas andother trade practices. These questions are now being actively pursued. the impact of certain other trade practices, e.gi, dumping and dual prices; which mightbe held to impede liberalisation, will probably have to be dealt with at a later stage.Anglo-Scandinavian Economic Co-operation50. On the initiative of the United Kingdom discussions took place inDecember and January with officials of the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish Gov-ernments, to explore the possibility lity of closer economic co-operation between thefour countries, and in particular of removing restrictions on payments. Thoughthe Scandinavian Governments were not able to accept our proposals in full,certain useful lines of immediate action were agreed and approved by the ministers concerned in Paris on 31st January. As a result, restrictions were lifted on current payments, existing blocked balances and on the transfer of certain formsof credit, investment capital and personal remittances. A study of further measures on these lines will be pursued by the Anglo-Scandinavian EconomicCommittee which has now been formed.Second Report of O.E.E.C.51. In accordance wth the decision of the Ministerial meetings in Paris atthe end of October, participating countries agreed to submit their national pro-grammes for 1950-51 and 1951-52 on a new and simplified basis. It had alreadybeen agreed that the Division of Aid among participants would be in the same proportion as in 1949-50, and the national programmes were thus designed toshow on the basis of pre-calculated aid and of certain assumptions, e.g., themaintenance of existing levels of United States industrial activity and prices,what the prospects of those countries might be of attaining dollar viability. TheUnited Kingdom memorandum (cmd.. 7862) submitted to the Organisation inDecember 1949 assumed the receipt of E.R.P. Aid of $720 million in 1950-51and- $480 million in 1951-52. The country memoranda formed the main basisof the Second Report of O.E.E.C. issued in February. This Report, whichrecorded the progress and prospects of O.E.E.C. at the &quot; half-way mark &quot; of theE.R.P. period, estimated that the dollar deficit of the participating countries,which for 1949-50 was put at slightly below $4! billion, would in 1950-51 beabout $3J billion, and in 1951-52 about $2^ billion. The Report set out thegeneral lines of policy by which participants hoped to eliminate their dollardeficits after 1952.The 1950-51 E.R.P. Appropriation52. The Economic Co-operation Administration^ request for finance in1950-51 is now being examined in Congress. The figure requested by E.C.A. is$2,950 million, including Western Germany, to which would be added $ 150 million
-carried over from 1949-50. E.C.A. propose to withhold from allocation not lessthan $600 million which will be kept available &quot; to encourage the aggressivepursuit of a programme of liberalised trade and payments&apos;&apos;; part of the sumwould be used to support the European Payments Union, and the balance wouldbe made available directly to the qualifying countries.The European Payments Union53. The future form of the Intra-European Payments Scheme has been thesubject of a report by financial experts in Paris, and the general lines of agreement on : the prerequisites for the scheme were embodied in the Second Report ofO.E.E.C.
