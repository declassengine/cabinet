Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 242nd March, 1950CABINET1950 FARM PRICE review memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State forScotlandIntroduction1. The statutory annual review of the economic condition and prospects of theagricultural industry as required by Section 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, isdue to be held. The review this year will be particularly difficult, primarilybecause of the substantial increases in costs confronting farmers, of which thelarger part arises from the decision of the last Government, announced by thePrime Minister on 24th October, 1949 (Official Report, Col. 1021), to eliminate the remaining part of the subsidy on animal feeding-stuffs. We have thought itdesirable, therefore, to seek the views of our colleagues on the general preliminaryinstructions to be given to our negotiators.2. The matters which will need shortly to be decided by Ministers, in thelight of the review, are :--(a) actual   prices   of   milk,   fatstock   and   eggs   in   the   year   ending31st March, 1951;(b) actual prices of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and sugar-beet of the 1951harvest;(c) minimum guaranteed prices for milk, fatstock and eggs over the two years ending 31st March, 1954.3. The subjects for discussion with the Farmers&apos; Unions, relatingto &quot; the general economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry &quot;are determined partly by precedent and partly by statements which have beenmade by Ministers on behalf of the Government at various times. These subjectsare : (i) agricultural production targets for the periods covered by the prices tobe announced;(ii) farmers&apos; aggregate net income, and for comparison those of others of the rural community;(iii) distribution of farm incomes by size and type of farm;(iv) estimate of farmers&apos; capital expenditure;(v) estimate of aggregate cost changes;(vi) cost changes by individual commodities;(vii) relative prices of comparable home-produced and imported products.Of these the first, second and fifth are by far the most important and the restof this memorandum is chiefly concerned with the issues arising under theseheads.38373
Production Targets4. The Agricultural Output Committee (which includes officials of the agriculture Departments, Treasury (including Central Economic Planning Staff),Ministry of Food, and Economic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat) have recentlyreviewed the progress of the Agricultural Expansion Programme.5. In the light of their report and of recommendations from the economic planning Board the Cabinet at their meeting on 7th February (CM. (50) 4th Con-clusions, Minute 1), decided on certain modifications in published productiontargets, as follows : Wheat.-Target for 1951 to be reduced from 2,750,000 acres to 2,550,000acres.Potatoes. Target for 1951 to be reduced from 1,300,000 acres to1,250,000 acres.Milk. Target for 1952-53 to be raised to 1,965 million gallons.No changes are proposed in the published targets for the remaining price-guaranteed products, namely, barley, oats, sugar-beet, cattle, sheep, pigs and eggs.6. The effect of these decisions is that the broad objectives of the AgriculturalExpansion Programme remained unchanged. The volume of net output is planned by 1952-53 to reach nearly 50 per cent, more than pre-war, and farmers are to be urged and assisted to reach this objective in the national interest. Aspecial propaganda drive has already been started to facilitate the attainment ofthe crop objectives.A ggregate Income, Capital Outlay and Costs and Inferences Therefrom7. The following figures, calculated by methods agreed with the central statistical Office, show the yearly changes in aggregate net income of farmersfor all farm products.* The figures for 1949-50 are still provisional, but are asfinal as they can be made for some months : -Actual or forecasted Aggregate net income adjustedJune   May aggregate net to normal yield andYears income weather conditions1943-44 (peak war year)	  million 237			  million 235f	1946-47     ...........		1834-		2044	1947-48     ...........		2204		228	1948-49     ...........		284-1-		2694	1949-50     ...........		281		2771	8.

For instance if feeding-stuffs prices rise, more money is needed under (b)since farmers have to lock up more capital in livestock before these mature.* The aggregate net income figures given in this and the succeeding paragraphs relate to allfarm production including that part consumed in farmers&apos; own households. That is, they includeincome derived from products (of which the most important are fruit and vegetables) for which thereare no guaranteed markets and prices, and for which, therefore, no question of price recoupmentby Government action for increased costs can arise. These figures give a valuable indication of the trend of total farm incomes, but they are only in part (75 per cent.) relevant to the price-fixing purposesof the February Review.   See paragraphs 9 and 17.t Rough estimate.

Although not strictly relevant to a consideration of farmers&apos; incomes,it should not be overlooked that the elimination of the subsidies on feeding-stuffswill involve domestic pig and poultry producers in extra costs estimated to amountto  1 - 6 million, for which, of course, there can be no question of recoupment. Itis to be expected that there will be vociferous protests from these one and three-quarter million domestic producers.11. The outstanding points in the above tables are that farmers&quot; incomeson a normal yield basis have continued to rise; that farmers are continuing to&apos;plough back in capital outlay a substantial part of that income well above the 40 million per annum injected in 1947-48 and subsequent years; and that thecost increases confronting them are very substantial indeed.12. We have no doubt that the chief and indeed preponderating explanation of the rise in net incomes over the last year or two is improvedefficiency. This development in efficiency became strikingly apparent when the february Review data were examined last year, and since then the trend seemsto have continued. Between 1948-49 and 1949-50 farm incomes should, on thebasis of decisions taken in february,  1949, have fallen by  6-7 million, but actuallyseem likely to have risen by  8 million. More direct evidence of improvedefficiency comes from the increase in livestock output without a proportionate increase in labour and feeding-stuffs the total labour force has indeed declined.The same is probably true of wheat and some other (but not all) crops. In milkthe development of efficiency has been especially outstanding.Proposed Objective for. Review Discussion13. We have now to decide how big a reduction of net incomes we should aim at securing in 1950-51 and on what grounds. It is always difficult at thisFebruary Review to strike a balance between the national requirements of exchequer economy on the one hand and of expanded food production on theother. The task will be exceptionally difficult on this occasion. The policy objec-tive, as laid down under Section 1 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, is &quot;minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in theindustry.&quot; We always have to face the possibility that what is considered&quot;proper remuneration &quot; by the Government on the basis of calculations whichnecessarily treat the United Kingdom as one large homogeneous farm, mayr, whentranslated into commodity prices for the individual farmer, appear to him to bederisory in relation to increased costs, especially when those are substantial.While therefore in the following paragraphs we make a statistical approach tothe problem, for the purpose of giving instructions to our officials, we ask our colleagues to bear in mind that the further expansion in home food production,which is an essential feature of our general balance of payments plan, can onlybe secured if we get a willing response from some 400,000 farmers the majorityof them small men and that psychological factors may well have to be takenmore fully into account at a later stage.* The elimination of feeding-stuffs subsidies is to operate from the beginning of the financialyear, 1950-51. According to existing procedure, however, farmers are only entitled to claim costrecoupment for the extra costs per unit applied to the rather smaller quantities of feeding-stuffs usedin 1949-50.383739. The cost increases confronting farmers on a full year basis (mainly1950-51 are estimated to be :   million
14. The aggregate net income in 1946-47 at normal yields was  204-1 million this was associated at the time with a declining output and was consideredinsufficient, but for the present purpose can be taken as a basis. Since 1946-47the volume of net output has been rising. The actual increase between that yearand 1949-50 is estimated at 12 per cent., but some part of this increase is attributable to the fact that we were starting from a year in which weather conditions were adverse. Making an arbitrary but generous allowance of 4 percent, for abnormally bad weather in the initial year, the increase in the net output at normal yields in the ensuring three years can be conservatively put at8 per cent. It is reasonable and desirable to allow farmers some reward for the extra capital outlay, risks and effort required to produce this increased output.This is consistent with the principles of the White Paper on Personal Incomes,Costs and Prices, which explicitly recognises increased productivity as a reasonwhich would justify an increase in personal incomes. Taking account of this factor, the base income to-day corresponding to  204^ million in 1946-47 wouldbe  221 million.15. To this should be added the  40 million which the Government under-took in 1947 to inject annually into farmers&apos; incomes for five years for the purposeof capital investment. (It should be noted that actual capital outlay by farmershas continued well above this figure see paragraph 8 above). This would thengive  261 million as the target in comparison with the estimated 1949-50 income of  2771 million.16. The effect of the adoption of  261 million as the target income for1950-51 would mean (taking into account the Government&apos;s decisions to eliminatefeeding-stuffs subsidies and reduce by half the subsidy on fertilisers) that the increases in costs would be roughly shared equally between the farmer and theconsumer or Exchequer. We should, however, point out that whatever net income is aimed at it will not necessarily be achieved in 1950-51. The decisions resultingfrom the review (see paragraph 2 above) will not all operate in 1950-51, but will still be producing effects in 1951-52 or later.17. The effects on farm prices for review products of a decision anchored to 261 million of aggregate net income would be as follows :   millionForecast incomes for 1949-50     ............ 2774Target income        .................. 261Proposed reduction in income (all products)    ...... 164Proposed reduction in income (review products only)(1) 124Add cost increases being incurred in 1949-50(2)        ... 8204Cost increases in full year (review products only)      ... 374To be recouped by price increases for review products ... 17(x) This calculation assumes that the income reduction of  164 million is shared between reviewproducts and non-review products respectively in the proportions to the gross incomes of these two groups. This treatment implies that the non-review products will suffer a reduction in net income of  4 million because the prevailing market conditions will be such that they will be unlikely to succeed in gaining recompense for the full increase in costs of  8 million.(2) Some of the cost increases mentioned in paragraph 9 have already taken effect or will take effect before the end of the current farm year (31st May, 1950). In calculating the net farm income for 1949-50 no allowance has been made for any price recoupment. Hence the  8 million involvedrepresents an addition to the proposed reduction in farm income on review products of  \2i million in 1950-51.18. This basis implies that farmers will have to bear no less than 20-g million (55 per cent.) of total cost increases for review commodities of 37-^ million in a full year. In addition; they have lost (since 31st December, 1949)ploughing grants of about  5 million, adjustment on potato acreage payments and other economies in the Estimates of the Agriculture Departments whichmight amount to a further  2 million. The Farmers&apos; Unions will no doubt argue that for the purposes of price recoupment these items should be regarded as inthe same category as cost increases.
11919. We have indicated that it is of outstanding importance to the achieve-ment of the agricultural expansion programme that at least the tacit, if reluctant,acceptance by the farmers&apos; leaders of the final decisions, when they are reached,should be secured and that further endeavour on the part of farmers to make themost efficient use of all their resources should be encouraged. We consider,therefore, that our negotiators should be authorised to discuss the practicability of measures, such as the following, which would mitigate the effects on foodproduction of the under-recoupment of  20^ million now proposed : (i) Fertiliser Subsidy. A continuance of that part of the subsidy which is directly related to grassland and marginal land development, on theunderstanding that this would be one of the factors to be taken intoaccount in determining the increase in farmers&apos; prices,(ii) Marginal Land.-While a substantial reduction in net incomes may bejustified in relation to farming as a whole, it would have a depressing effect on the marginal areas, and some offset in these areas in the formof a subsidised scheme of development would be required. Thedevelopment of these marginal areas offers the main source of increasednumbers of beef cattle and sheep, on which a larger supply of home-produced meat mainly depends, and their importance was expresslyrecognised in the Government&apos;s pre-election manifesto.20. Fertilisers. We have noted that the Economic Planning Board have recommended that any further subsidies on fertilisers should be on a selectivebasis for the development of grassland and marginal land. In England andWales this could, on the grassland side, take the form of a subsidy of one-thirdof farmers&apos; expenditure on nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers for grasslanddevelopment. In Scotland the choice of fertilisers and the method adopted mightbe somewhat different, but again it would be grassland and marginal land whichwould qualify for the rebate. The cost in the United Kingdom would be of theorder of  5 million. Such a scheme would be relatively expensive and difficultto administer equitably throughout the country, but we cannot think of any otherwhich would accord with the principle of selectivity suggested by the economic planning Board. While in respect of grassland such a scheme would be basedprimarily upon the need to develop the grass, it would not necessarily require thatthe subsidised fertilisers should be applied only to those fields actually under grassin any one year, since there may be other stages in a rotation involving grass atwhich the fertiliser should preferably be applied.21. Marginal Land. During recent weeks a working party of officials hasbeen examining this question and the Panel on Import Substitution has also beenconducting a sample scientific survey of the area of marginal land in Englandand Wales that is capable of improvement, including an estimate of the cost involved. Information is already available for Scotland. Both these enquiries are nearing their conclusion, and it is now apparent that if the production offood, and especially of meat, is to be developed to the full extent of our resourcesmuch more use should and can be made of marginal land. It is tentativelyestimated that some 4 million acres of marginal land in Great Britain could be substantially developed and it is thought that the best method would be to intro-duce a scheme of reconditioning such land with the aid of Government grants onthe lines of the Hill Farming Act, 1946. It is unlikely, however, that farmers and landowners would be prepared voluntarily to tackle more than about half thearea mentioned during the next five to ten years, and in that event the annualExchequer commitment (assuming grants of 50 per cent, of the cost) would notexceed an average of more than about  4-^ million, a relatively small increase inthe capital investment programme.22. We should be glad of authority to instruct our officials to negotiate withthe farmers on the lines indicated in paragraphs 14 to 21, the position ofMinisters being fully reserved, as is customary. We expect that the discussionswill have reached a stage in about ten days&apos; time at which it will be appropriate to report the results to a Ministerial Committee in preparation for a further and concluding round of discussions with the farmers. It might be necessary to consult only the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Minister of Food if, as we hope,our colleagues will allow us that measure of discretion.
Summary23. To summarise the points on which decisions are now required, we aslour colleagues to agree that our negotiators in the Price Review be authorised trlenter into discussions with representatives of the National Farmers&apos; Unions oil the following basis (it being understood that the position of Ministers ijreserved) (i) the target income to be kept in mind should be  261 million;(ii) of the cost increases in a full year of  37^ million it should be corjtemplated that the farmers might receive recoupment of  17 million!and no recoupment for the remaining  20^ million;(iii) the practicability of further subsidies for the development of grasslancjand marginal land should be explored during the negotiations.J.
