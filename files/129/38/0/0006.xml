THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT   1&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No3 1CP. (SO) 66th January, 1950CABINETCONTRACTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS and members OF parliament note by the Prime minister should like to impress on Ministers who are in charge of purchasingDepartments the need for care before entering into contracts for the purchase of&apos;goods, produce or materials from Members of Parliament. As we know frompast experience, the law on this subject is very wide but far from clear on many points. Ministers and their Departments should be on their guard against any-thing in the nature of a direct or indirect sale of goods to a Government Depart-ment by a Member of Parliament personally or by his agent or by any firm inwhich he is a partner. Casual over-the-counter transactions are not affected, but any substantial contract, particularly if not manifestly of a transient nature,would probably constitute a contravention by the Member of Parliament of theHouse of Commons (Disqualification) Act, 1782, and other statutory provisions.No such contract should be entered into without prior consultation with theDepartments legal adviser or solicitor.The Solicitor-General is presiding over a Committee which is examining thelaw and practice governing disqualifications from membership of the House ofCommons arising from the holding of offices of profit or from interest undercontracts. Until any fresh legislation has been introduced on the basis of recommendations made by the Solicitor-General&apos;s Committee, special caution isrequired to avoid inadvertent infringement of the existing statutory provisions.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S. IV. 1,(ith January, 1950.38110
