I do notconsider that I can temporise any longer and I attach,for the consideration of my colleagues,  a draft answerwhich I would propose to circulate in the official report.A* 3*Ministry of Health, S.W.I. ,7TH MARCH,  1950.COPY NO. 2J

DRAFT STATEMENT1. The Government have been, considering whetherthey can usefully publish any further information aboutthe extent of the demand and need for houses.2. In the White Paper issued by their predecessorsin 1945 it was estimated that at that time some three quarters of a million dwellings were needed &quot;to afford a separatedwelling for every family which desires to have one&quot;, andthat a further half million houses were needed &quot;to removehouses already condemned as unfit and to abate overcrowdingcondemned since 1935&quot;*3. The estimated increase of population in GreatBritain since the beginning of 1945 is about 1,1-1-00,000,which on an average of, say, 3-g- persons per household,would require some further 400,000 homes.    statistical information as to the increase in the number of separatefamilies is not available4* From the time when the post war housing programme was launched in 1945 the efforts of local authorities were concentrated primarily on the provision of homes for familieswho were without a separate home of their own and who had expressed a desire to have one.5. Towards the end of 194-8 over 800,000 additionalhomes had been provided, and on the basis of the estimatesmade in 1945 and with the knowledge that housing demand was not evenl3r spread throughout the country it would havebeen expected that in many districts the demand fromfamilies without a separate home of their own would havebeen substantially met and that these authorities wouldin the near future be able to turn to the task of abatingovercrowding and the removal of unfit houses.6. The information published locally by localauthorities as to the numbers of applicants did not, however,support this view.    It was, therefore, considered that anattempt should be made to see whether a reliable estimatecould be made of the present effective demand for houses.Local authorities were accordingly asked in November, 1948,to sift their records of housing applications and to informthe Ministry of Health how many of their applicants stilldesired accommodation.;7. As a result of this review there has in manydistricts been a substantial reduction in the number of applicants, a considerable proportion of those on the listsnot replying to the enquiries addressed to them or statingthat they had found their own accommodation.    Moreover the examination centrally of the returns has shown that quite a large number of applicants are on the lists of more thanone authority, thereby inflating both the total numberof applicants and the real numbers for the districtsconcerned.With 1,500 local authorities it is inevitable that there should be much variation in the administrative arrangements for dealing with applications made to them,  amatter which is by statute vested in the individual authorities.    As the reports came in it became apparent that some authorities admit applications to their lists only after enquiry and keep their lists under regular review:others, having accepted applications without enquiry,have no regular arrangements for reviewing the lists as awhole, but bring under review only those cases at the top of the list who come under consideration as houses become available for letting.    Between these two extremes there isa wide variety of practicea-1-

8. The request to the local authorities was couched in as simple a form as possible to avoid undue expenditureof labour and in order to meet the&quot; wishes of the associations of local authorities.    Examination of the replies has shown that the form was not sufficient to iron. out these differences in the administrative arrangementsmade by different local authorities.    For this reason andalso because of the amount of duplication, the informationderived gives an erroneous picture of the effective total demand and also of its distribution between the various local authorities.9, It is, of course,  open to individual localauthorities to give such information as they think fit inregard to the situation in their own area;    in any suchstatements the local authority can indicate the basis oftheir information and the nature of the arrangements madein the particular- district for the initial and periodicalreview of applications6    An attempt to link thesevariations into a single series of centra], statisticswould, however, as already indicated, produce distortedand unreliable figures.     It has, therefore, been decidedthat it would be misleading to publish any figures centrallyas a result of the request made to local authorities,10.- Two conclusions emerge, however, from the attemptwhich was thus made to obtain a preliminary picture ofthe situation -(1)    After making every allowance for variations inthe local arrangements for classifying andreviewing applications, it is clear that theoriginal estimate which was made during thewar was a substantial under-estimate of the true position^   At the time it was necessarilybased on national statistics of a very general character and not on local analyses and no allowance could be made for changes in social and economic conditions after the war.(2)    The number of applicants who have been acceptedby local authorities as requiring a new homeand which are still outstanding will call forthe continuance of the housing programme at thehighest rate that is possible for some time tocome in order to enable a separate home to be offered to each family who desire to have one,11. The experience both of the estimate published in19^+5 and of the sifting of applications in 19^9 confirm the undesirability of making global estimates except bymeans of detailed local analysis prepared on a standardbasis and made according to an uniform procedure in all areas,12, Such an analysis will have to cover both theoccupancy and the condition of existing houses:    it willhave to shew the extent of overcrowding,  the number ofunfit houses, and the extent of the need both for repairs and for improvement.    It can, of course, be secured only by a comprehensive survey of their area by each localauthority with arjpropriate arrangements for keeping theresult of the survey up to date,13* My Department are undertaking preliminaryconsultations with the Associations of local authorities as to the form which such a survey should take in order tosecure the best results,

When these arrangements have been completed,and the necessary forms of record have been settled, theywill be made available to local authorities,  in order thatthey may be used in connection with the currentadministrative work of their staffs,lh. The actual execution of such a survey in each district will depend on the availability of local resourceand it will no doubt be possible both to start and tocomplete such surveys more expeditiously in some districtsthan In others.l.f5. It must, however, be made clear that theexecution of these surveys will take a considerable timeand involve a heavy burden on the staffs of localauthorities.    It will not be possible to require this workto be undertaken at a time when these staffs are heavilyengaged on other urgent tasks and when there is a pressingneed for economy in local government man-power.    some information bearing on these points will become available through the census of population.    The timing for the initiation of the detailed housing surveys will have tobe considered by the Government in consultation with.the Associations of local  authorities with due regard tothese considerations, and a further statement will be made before action is taken to launch the surveys.Ministry of Health,7th March,  1950.
