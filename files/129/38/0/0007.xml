DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)5 C R E Tk (.50) 7 , COPY NO.   ^FH JANUARY, &apos; 1950CABINETTOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS MARKETING scheme memorandum by the Minister of food the memorandum by the President of the Board of trade on the Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme (CP. (50) 2)raises the question of how far the Government are prepared togrant restrictive powers to Marketing Boards which may be usedto increase food prices or to maintain them at a higher level than would be justified by the supplies available.      The case for these restrictive practices was referred to the official committee on Restrictive Practices by Supervisory Boards and theOfficial Committee were not convinced that the case for the restrictive powers had been proved.      I ask my colleagues tosupport the view that no case has been made out to give theproposed Tomato and Cucumber Board the power which it seeksunder Article 70(1) and 73 which, as the Official committee report, would enable the Board:-(a) &quot;to compile a list of wholesalers or commissionsalesmen and lay it down that producers must selltheir goods to or through those on the list.They could also lay down the description oftomatoes which could be sold and the terms of sale. &quot;(b) &quot;to require all producers to sell all or any partof their output only to the Board or through the agency of the Board and would allow the Board to fix prices for sales made by producers.&quot;2. The tomato industry, and in particular,  the glasshousesection which is responsible for promoting this scheme,  is highly profitable.      Brief periods of glut do not alter this general picture, nor do they of themselves justify the settingup of a permanent Board which, to justify its existence, will no doubt exercise some of its restrictive powers continuously.During the public enquiry into the scheme, the Co-operative wholesale Society, one of the largest growers, stated that in19^4-8 out of a production of tomatoes valued at the Y/holesalestage at  /+00,000 they made a net surplus of  162,000.      Iunderstand that in 1949 the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;sresults have again been very good indeed.      The private sectionof the industry do not disclose comparable figures.      The factthat the industry is thriving is confirmed by the steady increasein the glasshouse acreage devoted to tomatoes.      In 1936 the acreage was 1,1+10, in 1939 it was 1,860, in 19kk, at the height of the war-time pressure on glasshouse owners to grow tomatoes,it was 3,300 and today, under conditions of free competitionwhen glasshouse owners are free to grov/ other crops, it iskeeping up to about 3=000 acres.      As for the future, in my view there is no change in prospect which will convert thisprosperous industry to one requiring monopolistic and restric-tive powers for its support.      The prospects of the horticulturalindustry when the country enjoys full employment are vastlydifferent from the difficulties which they encountered in the

depressed decade &quot;before the war when we had nearly 2,000,000&quot;unemployed.      Now the plea for protection is coming from a highly profitable industry.3. At.the same time as the industry as a whole has beenthriving, the consumer has had abundant supplies of tomatoesat reasonable prices.      The abandonment of licensing, which even in the independent hands of my own Ministry tended to haverestrictive results, and the freeing of prices have,  I believe,contributed to the abundance of supplies at reasonable prices which we have been seeing this year in the shops and on thebarrows.      It is significant that the Co-operative wholesale society, one of the largest growers, are strongly opposing thescheme, because it may well have the effect of limiting their&apos;progress in free competition as a cheap, efficient producer and because it may also mean dearer tomatoes for the public.U.      Powers sought by the promotersThe promoters of the scheme seek to maintain and improve these conditions.      What are the powers they seek forthis purpose?      There are several powers covering such matters as market intelligence and research and the collection of statistics, which may well be desirable, but the powers onwhich the scheme would no doubt mainly depend are those des-cribed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Official Committee&apos;sreport.      These would enable the Board to prevent the  sale oftomatoes and cucumbers except by traders whom they havelicensed and,  subject to the approval of these powers by theMinister, to determine maximum, minimum or fixed prices fortomatoes and cucumbers.      In the final resort the Board coulddecree that all or any particular grade of tomatoes andcucumbers shall be sold only to or through the Board.5. I do not suggest that the present promoters of thescheme would use these powers lightly,  for to do so would cause a public outcry.      But their mere existence in the hands of aprivate board, representative, apart from the two nominees ofthe Minister of Agriculture,  of a single interest,  is an openinvitation to that interest to exercise monopolistic pressures on the rest of the community.      It is true that there is now the safeguard of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 19493 underwhich the Minister of Agriculture can give Directions.      Butwe should not place excessive reliance on this.      In practice the Board will always be in a strong tactical position of having the reins in their hands and of having the backing of acompact, well organised and vocal body of producers.       It is because Directions are not a fully satisfactory weapon for preventing the misuse of restrictionist powers that we requireproposals for the granting of such powers to be closelyexamined,  in relation to the particular circumstances of theindustry concerned, by the Board of Trade and by its inter-departmental Committee on Restrictive Practices by SupervisoryBoards.      The Committee has not agreed that the powers sought for controlling the marketing of tomatoes and cucumbers are justified by the criteria which the Government has hithertosought to establish.6. Moreover,  I am not convinced that the restrictivepowers proposed would,  in fact, effect the improvements in marketing which are really needed - the cheapening of distri-bution and the clearing of the blockages which develop in the channels of distribution during the occasional periods of glut.The powers could,  of course, be used in an attempt to concealsuch blockages by preventing growers from marketing part oftheir produce, by requiring preferential terms for sales in one area rather than another or for one purpose rather than another,or, through the issue of conditional licences to wholesalers and

importers, by securing an effective restriction on imports oron sales of particular grades of tomatoes so that prices canbe kept up.      But action on these lines would hardly touch the true marketing problem.      There is much more hope in.theBoard&apos;s non-restrictive powers.      By these it can open up newoutlets, popularise tomatoes,  and improve grading and packing andit is along these lines that I believe a real improvement in marketing and distribution must be sought.       I should welcome such action, whether by private enterprise,  a Marketing board or the Government.7*      General Considerations .As this is the first scheme to be proposed under theAgricultural Marketing Acts since the war we should also,  Ithink, note certain matters of general interest.      The promoters of the scheme draw the attention of the producers to their viewthat  &quot;it would be difficult to argue the case for control ofimports without some organisation of the home industry&quot;.Before the war one of the important activities of Marketing-Boards was to persuade the Government of the day that imports should be restricted to the level required to meet the needs ofthe home market at whatever price level they sought to maintainfor their members.      The Boards were in. a strong position to advocate effectively the restriction of imports in that theywere well-organised and articulate whereas the general consume-ing public were ill-organised and inarticulate.      If severalmore producers Boards are to be established covering a wide range of agricultural and horticultural products - and this seems to be the aim of the farmers&apos;  organisations - the diffi-culties impeding our policies for the liberalisation of trade would be greatly increased.      It is not possible to reconcile the quantitative restriction of imports of horticulturalproduce with our other proposals for the liberalisation ofEuropean trade.8. The application of the Agricultural Marketing Actsto the horticultural group of commodities raises other problems which will need to be examined.      We are asked on this occasion to approve the setting up of a separate Board with powers toimpose levies on producers of tomatoes and cucumbers.      This newsuperstructure on the industry is additional to the present arrangements for marketing and. distribution and its cost mustultimately be borne in the consumer price of these twocommodities.       I understand a similar scheme is in preparation for apples and pears.      Where are we to stop in allowing the setting up of these Boards?      There are many other horticulturalcommodities for which just as strong a case could be made.      Thetotal domestic output of the whole group of fruit and vegetablesindustries excluding potatoes,   is only about  120,000,000.      Itis doubtful whether we should encourage the use of the Agri-cultural Marketing Acts for the setting up of a multiplicityof producers boards each with wide  statutory powers and eachcovering one or two relatively minor commodities.9.      conclusion recommend., therefore,  that the promoters of thetomatoes and cucumbers scheme be informed that the Government are&apos;unable to approve the restrictive powers sought in Articles70(1)  and 73 and that approval of the powers to lay down methodsof grading would be subject to the Board&apos;s undertaking a systemof grading which does not prevent any consumable food from reaching the market.      The promoters,of the scheme must thendecide whether they are prepared to launch a scheme without these restrictive powers.try of Pood. S. v.&quot;. 1.10TH JANUARY,  1930.
