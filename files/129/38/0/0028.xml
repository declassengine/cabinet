(0 The figures for the first five items in this table are averages for 12 months. Theremaining figures are averages for the period January to September, inclusive.5. A simple comparison with the increase of just over 1 per cent, in thenumbers employed in the industries covered by the index shows clearly that the increase in production was largely an increase in output per man.There is very little firm evidence about changes in productivity, and crudecomparisons of production and employment indices provide only a roughguide. Nevertheless, the general inference is supported by more reliablestudies of a more limited field. It is probable that output per man year in business enterprises increased by nearly 4 per cent, compared with theincrease of 2\ per cent, assumed in the National Income forecasts inthe last Survey. In the industries covered by the index of production theincrease seems to have been about 5-^ per cent.Economic Survey for 1950OPART I.-DEVELOPMENTS IN 19491. Introductory. The economic situation at the beginning of 1949 wasanalysed in detail in the last Economic Survey. Production was high and productivity was rising. Current payments on the United Kingdom&apos;s inter-national account had been brought roughly into equality with earnings.The gold and dollar deficit of the sterling area was still very large, but ithad been reduced substantially in 1948. Inflationary pressure, although con-tained, still persisted ; there was excess demand&apos; for consumer and investmentgoods. Government expenditure was rising, and1 pressure for wage increasescontinued. Nevertheless, in spite of the elimination of the: United Kingdom^foreign deficit, inflationary pressure had been reduced during 1948 ; therewere few symptoms of open inflation and prices were fairly stable.2. In the light of this analysis the Survey set out the main tasks for 1949.These were firstly to raise production and productivity still higher and tobring down costs, while maintaining and improving the quality of ourproducts; secondly to continue the battle against inflation ; and thirdly tocontinue to reduce the gold and dollar deficit, particularly by expandingUnited Kingdom exports to Canada and the United States. Emphasis was laid upon the need for international co-operation in finding solutions forthe problems of international trade. The purpose of this opening partof the Economic Survey for 1950 is to assess the progress that was madewith these tasks during 1949. More detailed information on developments in particular sectors of the economy will be found in Part III, which providesstatistical material which can be compared with the programmes and fore-casts of the last Survey.3. Production and Productivity. Total production increased steadily during1949, and substantial advances were made in almost every part of the economy. The rate of growth was most rapid in industrial production andthe interim index of industrial production, which covers industries accounting for roughly half the national income, was nearly &amp;\ per cent, higher duringthe first nine months of 1949 than in the same period of 1948.4. The changes in industrial production were, naturally, very different in different industries but progress was more uniform in 1949 than in theprevious year. A quarter of the total increase in production was attributable to the engineering, shipbuilding and vehicle group as against one-third in1948. The output of several industries increased more rapidly in 1949 thanin 1948, especially the food industries, clothing, paper and! printing and!the furniture industry. Production indices for important industries are shown in Table 1.Production in certain industries(l)

6. Conspicuous increases in output per man appear to have taken placein the motor vehicle industry and some branches of the steel industry, liketubes and wire rods. Factors behind the increase in output per man were&apos;the improvements in the skills of workers and managers and the continuedimprovements in supplies and stocks of raw materials and components, the significance of which is illustrated by the experience of the motor vehicles,aircraft, paper and printing and furniture industries where productivityseems to have increased well above the average.7. It is impossible to estimate how much of the improvement in output per head in 1949 is to be attributed to non-recurrent factors like the dis-appearance of raw material shortages. Nevertheless some part of the pro-gress must have been due to continuing forces. It is probable that the investment of the post-war years began to show results in output per manduring 1949. Both management and workers are more conscious of theimportance of higher productivity in the present economic circumstanceslargely helped by the campaigns organised by the Government employersand the T.U.C. The development of joint consultative machinery hasencouraged interest in this subject at the factory level. Confidence in thecontinuance of conditions of full employment has resulted in a greaterreadiness on the part of the two Sides of industry to adopt improved methodsof work and incentive schemes of payment.8. The Balance of Payments. Some increase in the gold and dollar deficit of the sterling area in the first half of 1949 was forecast in the last Survey.But the deterioration was much greater than was expected.9. There were two main reasons for this. First, although United Kingdompurchases in the dollar area were no greater than forecast, dollar expenditure by the rest of the sterling area rose above the level expected. Second, andmore important, the dollar earnings of the sterling area as a whole fell,whereas it had been hoped that they would continue to increase as in 1948.An important reason for this was a falling off in the level of industrial activity in the United States, which led to sharp reductions in sales of, andin the prices of, the primary products which the sterling area exports. Wide-spread expectation that the pound would have to be devalued produced atendency for sterling area importers to anticipate, and of foreign importersto delay, purchases and payments. The combined effect of all these develop-ments was a deficit greater than could be met by E.R.P. receipts. Therewere, therefore, heavy drawings on the gold and dollar reserves, already ata dangerously low level, and this further weakened confidence in sterling.10. The dollar crisis was not confined to the sterling area. But the scale of the sterling area&apos;s transactions with the dollar area, exceeding the tradewith the dollar area of all other O.E.E.C. countries put together, renderedits difficulties particularly acute.11. Emergency measures were, therefore, adopted. A temporary stop wasordered on further United Kingdom purchases from the dollar area, exceptfor certain special cases. A meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministerswas held in July, and the United Kingdom announced its intention to reduceimports from the dollar area to 75 per cent, of their level in 1948. TheFinance Ministers of all Commonwealth members of the sterling area (apartfrom South Africa whose position is exceptional) agreed to recommend totheir Governments action comparable in its effect to that taken by the UnitedKingdom. It was hoped that these measures would check the loss of reservesquickly enough to restore confidence in sterling, and thus bring about a resumption of purchasing by dollar countries and an end to the- lag inreceipts and anticipation of payments.12.-But the loss of reserves continued in the third quarter of the year.Dollar earnings fell still further and the conviction strengthened abroad thata sterling exchange rate of $4.03 to the   could not be maintained. In thesecircumstances continued efforts to hold this rate might have led to the exhaustion of the reserves, and devaluation of the pound was decided on.By this time the-reserves had fallen from $1,856 million at the beginningof the year to $1,340 million.13. A rate of exchange of $2.80 to the   was selected representing adevaluation of just over 30 per cent. A low i ate was chosen in order both to allay expectations of further devaluation, and to make sterling goodssufficiently competitive in dollar markets to offer the prospect ultimately ofa substantial increase in dollar earnings.14. Many other countries had been expriencing difficulties similar to thoseof the United Kingdom, and the devaluation of the pound was quickly&apos;followed by a general realignment of world currencies.15. A spectacular reduction in the sterling area gold and dollar deficittook place following devaluation. In the fourth quarter of 1949 the deficitwas $31 million as compared with $539 million in the third quarter. about half of this improvement is attributable to purely temporary and non-recurringfactors, the immediate effects of devaluation and American stock-rebuildingafter the reduction of buying earlier in the year. Of the rest of the improve-

Imports of goods and services exceeded exports by about  105 million or by little less than in 1948. The whole of the increase in the national product was taken by expenditure at home.19. The following table gives the value at market prices of the goods and services available to meet domestic expenditure, and shows how much was spent on goods and services by private consumers, how much the Govern-ment bought for current use, and how much was spent for investmentpurposes.NATIONAL RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURE, 1948-49Table 3   millionResources available	1948	1949	Domestic expenditure	1948	1949Gross national product at			Personal consumption ...	8,100	8,370market prices......	12,035	12,675	Government current ex-		Net gifts and loans from			penditure on goods and		abroad and sales of			services .........	1,840	2,040Foreign Assets	110	80	Gross capital formation					at home	2,205	2,345Total resources available			Total domestic expendi-		at market prices	12,145	12,705	ture at market prices ...	12,145	12,75520. Most of tihe increase in expenditure on personal consumption seemsto have been due to price increases so that there was little change in this item in real terms. On the other hand both expenditure by public authorities on goods and services and investment appear to have increased significantlyin real terms and taken together accounted for almost the whole of theincrease in national output.ment some is believed to represent a genuine improvement in the position,but a considerable part must have resulted from factors not directly con-nected with devaluation such as the cuts in import expenditure here and inthe rest of the Commonwealth decided upon during the summer, and froma significant increase in United States consumption and demand for sterling area products. The permanent effect upon export and dollar-earning capacitywill only become fully apparent during 1950. Meanwhile, more than half ofthe reserves lost during the crisis in the summer had been recovered by theend of 1949.16. In the first half of 1949, the United Kingdom&apos;s receipts and payments on current account with the whole of the outside world were approximately equal. There was some deterioration during the year ; nevertheless the deficit for 1949 as a whole was lower than in 1948. Detailed tables on the balanceof payments will be found in Part II.17. The National Income and the Balance of the Economy. The outputof business enterprises appears to have increased by rather more than  400million at 1948 prices, or by about 5 per cent, in real terms. after allowing for price changes as far as they can at present be estimated these increases in output are estimated to have led to an increase in the gross national product of over  600 million. The main constituents of this increaseare shown in Table 2.The Gross National Product 1948-1949

21. Government expenditure on goods and services increased by something like  200 million and there was also an increase in transfer payments. Revenue,however, rose, and exceeded expectations largely because of the increase inprofits in earlier years. Consequently the currnt surplus of public authoritiesincreased from  515 million in 1948 to  585 million in 1949.22. The disinflationary policy during 1949 exercised a restraining influence in the monetary field as is shown by. the moderate scale of growth of Bankcredit in that year.23. The total of deposits, as measured by the liabilities on the Current,Deposit and Other Accounts of the &quot;London Clearing Banks, was virtuallystable in contrast with the increase (itself on a diminishing scale) shown in previous years. The average of the monthly figures for the year was  5,974million, as compared with  5,913 million for 1948, and  5,650 million for 1947, an increase of 1 per cent, as compared with nearly 5 per cent, inthe previous year. By contrast, the &apos;ncrease in the money national incomeduring 1949 was of the order of 7 per cent. In spite of the fact that thedemands of industry and business generally for working capital led to afurther increase in Bank advances during the year, the monthly average ofthe London Clearing Banks&apos; Advances to Customers and Other Accounts roseonly to  1,440 in 1949, against  1,319 in 1948 and  1,107 in 1947, an increase on the year of 9 per cent., as compared with 19 per cent, in the previous year.24. In April, 1949, the Chancellor of the Exchequer issued a further memo-randum of guidance to the Capital Issues Committee, emphasising the need to exercise restraint over capital expenditure, and stressing the importance ofgiving preference to increases cf capacity needed to overcome shortages of basic materials ; projects likely substantially to increase exports to hard cur-rency markets, or to effect savings in imports from hard currency sources ;the development of technical advances, new practices, and research anddevelopment projects contributing to industrial progress ; and projects whichwould yield marked and immediate reductions in costs. As on former occa-sions, the principles laid down in this memorandum were brought to thenotice of the Bankers, in order that their policy in the matter of credit facilities should continue to conform with that of the Capital Issues Com-mittee. A further letter was sent to Bankers in October, 1949, in which, afterrecognising the co-operation which he and his predecessors had received, theChancellor re-emphasised the great importance which he attached to every endeavour to hold inflationary pressures in check.25. There can be little doubt that the pressure of demand was uncomfort-ably high in 1949. Unemployment remained at the same low level as in1948, and with some variation for seasonal reasons averaged about 340,000or about \\ per cent, of the number of insured employees. The number ofunfilled vacancies reported after falling continuously from the middle of 1947to the end of 1948 rose during the first half of 1949 and has since declined.Over the whole year it averaged about 430,000. Measures were adopted inthe Autumn of 1949 to reduce investment and Government expenditure inorder to ease existing pressure and to ensure that the increase in exportswhich devaluation had made possible and necessary was not frustrated by too strong a pull from the home market.26. There are some indications, however, that the pressure of demand waseasing in the later part of the year. The level of exports which has been maintained since devaluation suggests that domestic demand was not aserious obstacle to expanding sales abroad. Although prices rose on theaverage, some prices were reduced. As supplies of other goods increasedconsumers offset increased expenditure on these by reducing their expenditureon drink, tobacco and entertainments. This implies that, during the courseof 1949 the amount which consumers were willing or able to spend did not increase so quickly as supplies available. The increase in the stocks of retaildistributors which seems to have occurred during 1949 provides supportingevidence. In general it seems that the position was easier by the end of1949 than earlier in the year.27. International Co-operation. The last Economic Survey pointedout the close relationship between the problems of the UnitedKingdom and the wider problems of world trade and payments.It is outside the scope of this Survey to deal with internationaldevelopments in detail but mention should be made of the con-ference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in July ; the tripartite discus-sions between the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada in Washing-ton in September ; and the arrangements agreed between members of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation towards freeing intra-European trade and payments.28. At the conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in July complete agreement was reached on immediate measures designed to stem the drain on the reserves, and on positive steps to increase sales of sterling area products in the dollar area in the longer term and to develop substitutes or alternative sources for goods at present imported from hard currency countries.

At the conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in July complete agreement was reached on immediate measures designed to stem the drain on the reserves, and on positive steps to increase sales of sterling area products in the dollar area in the longer term and to develop substitutes or alternative sources for goods at present imported from hard currency countries.   The

Ministers also re-emphasised the need for close and continuous consultation between Governments on economic affaire and made recommendations forthe necessary action to meet this need. At the Colombo meeting in January,1950, further economic discussions were held to exchange information and totake stock of developments since the July meeting.29. During the tripartite discussions in Washington in September the whole range of problems arising from the trade and financial relationships betweenthe sterling area and the dollar area were examined. Agreemenfwas reached on a number of, objectives and on immediate steps to bring those objectivesnearer, involving both separate and joint action. Perhaps most important of all was the explicit recognition by the governments concerned that respon-sibiiity for righting the deep disequilibrium in world trade rests not only onthe debtor countries but also on the creditor countries.30. During 1949 member countries of the O.E.E.C. signed a second Intra-European Payments Agreement for the year ending 30th June, 1950, on afreer, less bilateral basis than the previous one. More important still, they agreed to reduce quantitative restrictions on trade between themselves. TheUnited Kingdom has abolished quantitative controls on the import of alarge number of commodities from O.E.E.C countries. Similar action hasbeen taken by most other participating countries. Belgium, Luxembourg,Switzerland and Western Germany had to be excluded on balance of paymentsgrounds from the benefit of the United Kingdorhs relaxations for the timebeing, since increased imports might lead to increased gold payments. UnitedKingdom relaxations have been extended to Commonwealth Sterling area countries, and a number of other countries. The United Kingdom^ relaxation-tions in the raw materials group (excluding oil) now extend to some 69per cent, of imports on private account in 1948 from all participating countries,in the manufactured goods group to 55 per cent, and in food and feeding-stuffs to 83 per cent. (In calculating the figure for the food and feeding-stuffs group, imports of those horticultural items for which the open importlicence is liable to suspension during certain periods of the year have been included.)PART II PROSPECTS FOR 1950(a) Introductory31. The experience of 1949 underlines the continuing importance in 1950of dealing with the pressure of internal demand and moving towards a more satisfactory balance of payments. For both, increased production at lowerinternal cost is required. The numbers in civil employment are unlikely toincrease in 1950 so that further increases in output and real income canonly come from increased output per head. Lower domestic costs are essen-tial to enable full advantage to be taken of devaluation and to meetincreasing competition from exporters in a number of non-dollar countries.The primary task is, therefore, one of increasing efficiency in order both to reduce costs and increase output.(b) Production and Productivity32. One of the healthiest aspects of the British economy since the war hasbeen the rate of increase of both production and of productivity. Theclaims upon total resources, however, may be expected to increase rapidly in the next few years. Certain government services will cost more because in those years there will be more of the population in the age groups forwhich these services provide e.g., more children of school age, more oldand potentially infirm people. A high rate of investment will be necessaryin order to enable the equipment of British industry to be kept up to date with modern developments. Moreover, a secure and rising standard of living,which can be maintained without special external assistance, is a fundamentalobject of all economic policy.33. There is no easy way to secure the additional output which will be needed. Unless exports to the important markets discussed in the balanceof payments section below can be increased substantially not even essential supplies of food and raw materials will be secure. Yet those exports haveto be sold in the face of keen and growing competition arid every possibleincrease in efficiency and reduction in costs is of urgent importance.34. No specific target is set for productivity. We require and should seek to achieve the greatest possible increases in output per head. Someassumptions about productivity have had to be made for the purpose offorecasting the national income in paragraph below, but the figures thsreadopted are not targets. Production prospects and requirements in a numberof important industries are discussed in Part III.(c) The Balance of Payments35. Introductory The balance of payments will remain the centraleconomic problem in 1950 and in succeeding years. There are two maintasks ; first to close the gap in the dollar accounts of the sterling area, and

secondly to maintain a reasonable balance in the external accounts of theU.K. with the world as a whole. We must solve both these problems ifwe are to make ourselves independent of special external aid and restore the strength of sterling on which so large a part of the world&apos;s trade is based.36. The gold and dollar deficit of the sterling area is made up of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s own deficit with the dollar area, the dollar deficit of the rest ofthe sterling area which falls as a charge on the central reserves, and thegold and dollars paid by the United Kingdom to certain non-dollar countries as a result primarily of the unbalance in the trade and payments relationsbetween these countries and the sterling area as a whole.37. The United Kingdom itself besides having a deficit with the dollar area has in the last few years shown a considerable surplus on current accountwith the non-dollar world. This surplus arises from a number of causes.The most important are the need to export to certain countries in the sterling area to acquire from them part of their gold production ; the flow of investment from this country, which in particular &quot;constitutes one of the major bonds linking the sterling area ; and the assistance to various countriesboth inside and outside the sterling area, to enable them to meet deficits intheir own external accounts.38. The balance of payments of the United Kingdom on current account is the result of the numerical addition of its own deficit with the dollar area and its surplus with the non-dollar area. Though this balance is in itselfan important measure of the extent to which the United Kingdom is or isnot in total adding to its own resources from overseas or making its own resources available overseas, as long as the final outcome is the sum oftwo such disparate elements its significance within fairly broad limits isdiminished. Thus an increase in the overall deficit of the United Kingdomresulting from a reduction in the non-dollar surplus, in turn the result, perhaps,of some reduction in the rate at which some countries are drawing on their sterling assets, cannot in itself be regarded as a cause for concern. Anincrease resulting from a rise in the United Kingdom deficit with thosecountries in the non-dollar area with which it (and the sterling area as awhole) happens to be in deficit, may, on the other hand, be a serious matter,particularly if the currency of the country in question is hard enough to necessitate gold and dollar settlements.39. The Gold and Dollar Deficit of the Sterling Area. By 1952 the dollaraccounts of the sterling area will have to be made to balance without E.R.P.and Canadian aid. Moreover, additional obligations will arise by that dateof finding dollars to meet interest payments and amortisation on the dollarloans made to us since the war.40. Closing the dollar gap is an enormous task which will require great efforts. The lines of action by the United Kingdom were set out in theLong Term Programme submitted to O.E.E.C. (Cmd. 7572) and discussed in last year&apos;s Survey, and in the statement to O.E.E.C. (Cmd. 7862) referredto in paragraph 42 below. But the chances of succeeding depend not onlyon the efforts of the United Kingdom or even on those of the sterling area as a whole. The general level of activity in the United States and otherdollar countries, their readiness to accept imports and the rate of dollarinvestment in the rest of the world, will be equally important factors.41. It is particularly difficult to forecast how much progress will be madein 1950 because the devaluation of last September has profoundly affectedevery aspect of the balance of payments and until more time has elapsedit is impossible to disentangle the short-lived from the more permanenteffects. Any attempt to do so now in the form of apparently precise statisticswould be seriously misleading. Moreover, as in 1949, the amount of aid to be allocated under the European Recovery Programme is still unknownand will have a profound effect on the course of the balance of payments inthe second half of the year. No detailed forecasts of the balance of payments in 1950 are therefore made in this Survey.42. The United Kingdom has, however, already submitted to the O.E.E.C.at its request a statement (Cmd. 7862) which, inter alia, shows the possible course of the sterling area&apos;s gold and dollar position over the next two years on a number of major assumptions laid down for all participating countries,particularly the level of United States activity and the amount of aid each country can expect to receive. The statement also assumed that by mid-1950the temporary effects of devaluation will have disappeared. The figuressubmitted for 1950-51 are discussed in the following paragraph.43. The gold and dollar balance of payments from 1947 to 1949 is setout in Table 4 together with the estimates for 1950-51.

(Cmd. 7862), which is1st July, 1950 to 30th June, 1951.45. In the second half of 1949 the total net gold and dollar deficitamounted to $570 million compared with $962&apos; million in the first half of1949. This primarily the result of the exceptional events of the last quarterof 1949 which have already been mentioned. By 1950-51 a further markedreduction in the gold and dollar deficit is looked for, to keep pace with the expected decline in the amount of assistance from the United States and canada.46. The United Kingdom should make the major contribution to thisdecline in the deficit. A substantial increase in the volume and value of exports should take place, but savings in dollar expenditure on imports arelikely to have the greater effect. Growing supplies from non-dollar sourcesmake these savings possible and it is expected that by 1950-51 the proportionof our total imports from the dollar area will fall to about 20 per cent,compared with 23-J- per cent, in 1938 and 23 per cent, in 1948.47. United Kingdom Exports to North America. Exports to dollarmarkets are not expected to expand sufficiently rapidly in the first halfof 1950 to compensate fully for the fall in their dollar prices following devaluation. In the longer run, however, provided that the improvedposition resulting from devaluation is not dissipated by inflation, thatproductivity continues to improve at least as rapidly as in competingcountries, and that the U.S. continues to be willing to accept increasingimports from the United Kingdom, a substantial increase should be possiblein earnings from direct exports to North America. This is an essential element in the task of closing the dollar gap. Apart from one or two specialitems such as whisky and decorated pottery, the demand for which is well established, a further expansion of United Kingdom exports to the UnitedStates depends on breaking into new and highly competitive markets forconsumers&apos; goods with new commodities or articles of special quality. Successwill largely depend on the willingness of British exporters to take the initiative and accept the considerable risks involved. In Canada, in addition to theproblem of competing for new markets for consumer goods, difficulties onthe supply side will have to be overcome in the field of engineering products,for which the demand appears to be substantial. During the year 1950-51it is hoped that earnings in dollars from exports to the dollar area will again reach the comparatively high levels of the early part of 1949.48. The United Kingdom balance on invisible account with the dollar area has normally been in deficit, since heavy expenditure is incurred onitems such as shipping (both freights and disbursements), interest, profits and dividends on U.S. investment in the U.K., and, above all, on the pro-duction of oil. The deficit for the year 1950-51 is expected to be smaller than before, among other reasons because dependence on U.S. shipping isbeing reduced and a progressive reduction in British Companies&apos; dollar expenditure in oil operations is taking place. (The small surplus in invisibleaccount in the second half of 1949 was due to the exceptional events ofthat period and cannot be expected to continue.)49. The deficit of the rest of the Sterling Area is profoundly affected bychanging economic conditions in the United States. Since devaluation therehas been a significant change for the better ; United States demand hasincreased in response to an increase in the activity of the raw material con-suming industries and stocks have been built up from excessively low levels.Dollar prices have improved and in some cases were back to their pre-devaluation positions by the end of 1949. The dollar deficit has alsobeen reduced as a result of economies in expenditure on dollar imports which followed the decisions of the Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting in London in July.

Table 5 shows the principal means of finance which were availableto the United Kingdom and the sterling area in meeting the gold and dollar deficit in 1947, 1948 and 1949. Though a small increase in the gold and dollar reserves took place in the second half of 1949, there was a furtherloss of $68 million over the year as a whole following the loss of $23 million in 1948. By the end of 1949 the reserves were still some $400 million lessthan at the end of 1947 and over $550 million less than at the end ofMarch, 1948, when assistance under the European Recovery Programmebegan. (See Table VII.) The precise movement of the reserves in futurecannot be predicted because of the uncertainties which have already beendiscussed. But these very uncertainties underline the crucial importance of strengthening the reserves on which the first impact of any unfavourabledevelopments must fall.Gold and Dollar Reserves^)Table 6	In terms of: 			U.S.	  million	  million (at	$ million	(at old rate)	 ^.S. $2.80)31 st December, 1945        .........	2,476	610	-31st December, 1946        .........	2,696	664	-31st December, 1947        .........	2,079	512	-31st March, 1948   ............	2,241	552	 30th June, 1948     ...      .........	1,920	473	30th September, 1948       .........	1,777	437	 31st December, 1948        .........	1,856	457	1 -31st March, 1949,............	1,912	471	 30th June, 1949     ............	1,651	406	 30th September, 1949      .........	1,425	 .	50931st December, 1949       .........	1,688	1	603(0 (Exchange Equalisation Accounts holding of gold, TJ.S. and Canadian dollars.)50. Furthermore, it is hoped that, under arrangements recently made bySouth Africa, it will be possible for the U.K. to earn a substantially larger proportion of the output of new South African gold than has been thecase hitherto. The Government of the Union of South Africa has decidedthat her gold and hard currency resources should be reserved for importsconsidered essential and suppliers in all countries will have a chance of competing on equal terms for this trade. As South Africa&apos;s gold production is valued at approximately $400 million a year the importance of thisreinforcement to the gold and dollar income of the sterling area needs noemphasis.51. On the favourable assumptions already mentioned it is possible to hope that the rest of the sterling area will begin to make a net contributionto the dollar accounts of the sterling area as a whole in 1950-51. A growingsurplus if this kind is essential to the future viability of the sterling area,and will help to restore the pattern of multilateral trade natural to a systemincluding both a highly developed industrial economy and primary producingareas.52. Losses of gold and dollars to non-dollar &quot;hard currency&quot; countries such as Belgium, Switzerland and Persia have been a major element in the sterling area&apos;s dollar accounts for some years. It is hoped that in 1950-51the total loss of gold and dollars to hard currency countries outside the dollar area will be substantially reduced, as a result of the effect of devaluationin improving the competitive power of U.K. exports.Financing of the Sterling Area Net Gold and Dollar DeficitTable 5 U.S. $ million

The General Balance of Payments of the United Kingdom. Althoughthe dollar deficit will be the most intractable, it is not the only balance ofpayments problem confronting the United Kingdom. In exporting to thenon-dollar world the United Kingdom has so far had the benefit not only of the substantial protection from United States competition afforded bythe world-wide dollar shortage, but also of the almost total absence ofGerman and Japanese manufactures from the world market. While the combined effect of devaluation and of the continued dollar-shortage will be favourable factors, the United Kingdom must expect sterner competition fromother non-dollar exporters.1 55. If United Kingdom exports in 1952-53 are to be maintained at the levels required to pay for imports on current scales, there will have to be asubstantial expansion in the volume of world trade in manufactures. this in turn will require a high level of world prosperity (based largely on expand-ing business activity in the United States), and the progressive dismantling oftrade barriers. ,The United Kingdom is pressing forward in schemes for the gradual freeing of world trade and payments, but the success of this policyitself depends on the continuation of world prosperity. jFor these reasons itis necessary to sound a warning about long-term prospects for export earnings.56. The current position on the general balance of payments is set outin Table 7. It must be emphasised that the figures for the second half of1949 are still partly estimated and subject to amendment^1)(?) More definitive figures (though still provisional) will shortly be published in the regularseries of White Papers on the U.K. Balance of Payments.57. It will be seen that by the beginning of 1949 the deficit with the dollar area and some other countries had been reduced to a level at which it wasmatched by other surpluses on current account, particularly with certainsterling area and O.E.E.C. countries. This approximate balance was dis-iturbed in the second half of the year when the total deficit increased from 10 million to an estimated figure of  70 million.. This increased deficit on current account was caused by a reduction in the surplus with the non-dollar area as a result of somewhat higher imports, lower exports and a lower surpluson invisibles account. There was, however, a marked recovery of exports tothe dollar area towards the end of the year, particularly following devalua-tion.58. For the reasons mentioned in paragraph       above, it is impossibleto put forward precise estimates for the general balance of payments in 1950.United Kingdom Balance of Payments on Current and Capital Accountwith all AreasTable 7   million

Given reasonable success in these endeavours it might be possible toraise the value of exports in 1950 to the neighbourhood of  2,000 million ayear, or about  250 million more than in 1949. If it were achieved thereis good hope that the increase in the value of imports might be more thanmatched by expanding exports, with a consequent small reduction in the deficit on visible account below the figure of approximately  170 million in 1949.)62. On invisible account there is reason to hope for a considerable improve-reassessment  compared with 1949. Provided there is no serious reduction in oilprices, a big increase in net earnings from oil can be expected as production and-refinery capacity expand and there should be gains from shipping and tourism.Once again no detailed forecast would be justified but in the circumstancesassumed the surplus on invisibles should be enough and possibly more thanenough, to offset the deficit on visible trade account.,Price trends following devaluation have still not fully worked themselves out.Moreover, the future course of raw material prices is dependent to a largeextent on the level of United&apos; States activity., The experience of 1949 showed the disproportionately large effects produced by comparatively small variations in the United States demand. Another major uncertainty is the effect of therecent action taken to liberalise trade between this country and other membersof O.E.E.C, Only experience can show what is likely to be the level of demand for many of the products now freed from control. (Similar&apos; un-icertainty exists about our own exports, which should benefit from parallelliberalising action taken by other countries.)59. It seems probable that in 1950 there will foe a substantial increase inthe value of imports from the non-dollar area as a whole.. Imports from the dollar area will be limited to approximately 75 per cent, of the 1948 dollarvalue in accordance with undertakings made at the Commonwealth finance ministers&apos; Meetings last July. But the volume of imports from all areas will almost certainly be greater than in 1949 as a result both of the measuresof liberalisation of trade and of increased availabilities of foodstuffs and other supplies of many kinds., Raw material supplies which are drawn to agreater extent from dollar sources, will not increase so much and no greatchange in aggregate is to be expected in other imports..60. The trend of exports in 1950 is also very difficult to predict. Devalua-tion has opened up great opportunities in many markets for United Kingdomexporters in competition with suppliers from hard currency sources., Butmuch depends on the course of United States export prices and the reaction of United States exporters to increased British competition., The trend ofUnited Kingdom export prices is also of vital importance. Some increase in costs has already taken place as a result of the recent rise in sterling pricesof raw materials and it- is inevitable that the prices of our exports of manu-f actured goods should follow suit. But it is of overriding importance that this increase should foe limited to the greatest possible extent, The United King-dom exporters have a decisive part to play in the drive towards dollarviability directly through increased sales to dollar markets and indirectlythrough greater exports of essentials to South Africa to earn gold and by increased sales to sterling area markets to help in maintaining the dollareconomies which all sterling countries have imposed on themselves.

In total, therefore, the United Kingdom balance of payments with allcountries in 1950 might go back to a position of approximate balance oreven show a small surplus on current account. But it is necessary to stressyet again the underlying uncertainties. (Prices aire the most important andthe most uncertain element. An increase of only one point in the importprice index is equivalent to about  20 million on the value of imports and,therefore, on any deficit (or off any surplus) in the total balance. The increasein exports must be made in face of severe competition. Moreover, underlyingall forecasts of the balance of payments is the assumption that a high levelcf United States activity and foreign trade will be maintained and that theUnited Kingdom will continue to receive assistance in meeting its gold and dollar deficit on an adequate scale.id) The National Income and the Balance of the Economy64. It is particularly difficult to assess the problem of maintaining internalstability in 1950. Much of the data, necessary to form a considered view onthe degree of disinflation achieved by the end of 1949, is still incomplete and provisional., As regards 1950, the effects of devaluation on prices and thelevel of trade ; the extent to which the special forces which have contributed to the rapid increase of productivity in recent years will continue ; and the changes which may take place in habits of personal saving can only beguessed. The analysis which follows is based on a number of stated assump-tions. The selection of these is very much a matter of judgment, and themost important depend on the sense of responsibility shown by the people asa whole to the needs of the situation. With different assumptions, the con-clusions themselves would be different. As the year progresses and more databecome available more certain analysis will be possible. Nevertheless, whiletoo much weight should not be placed on the numerical estimates in the tables, they are sufficiently reliable to show the broad outline of the internalfinancial situation with which we must deal in 1950, and what is required ofthe nation if internal Stability is to be maintained.!65. As in the previous years the basis of these forecasts is the estimate ofthe amount by which the national output is likely to increase during thecurrent year. This year it has been possible to provide in Table 10 some detail of the growth of output which has been assumed in particular sectors of the economy. Since the industrial population is expected to be virtuallyconstant between 1949 and 1950, the increase in the national output will depend upon how much productivity increases. It is very difficult to forecast the growth of productivity, and the figure which has been taken is morean assumption than a forecast. It has been assumed that productivity in thefield of business enterprises as a whole will increase by about 2\ per cent,compared with an increase of nearly 4 per cent, in 1949. This corresponds to an increase in productivity in the industries covered by the Index ofProduction of 3-J- per cent, in 1950 compared with about 5\ per cent, in 1949.With an increase in productivity of this magnitude, the output of businessenterprises and the national product would increase in 1950 by about  250million at constant prices,&apos;66. The importance of avoiding any increase in domestic costs and, ifpossible, reducing them has been stressed already. If this aim is to berealised, it is essential that the policy of wage restraint agreed by the TradesUnion Congress should be adhered to strictly. Given such restraint, thendomestic prices should increase only to the extent that the cost of imports is increased by devaluation. Allowance has been made, however, for some increase in sterling prices in the export trade, to take account of cases wherethe price of exports in terms of dollars has not fallen by the full amount of devaluation.67. Making the best allowance possible for price movements, and if produc-tivity moves as suggested above, the value of the gross national product at market prices will increase by  450 million between 1949 and 1950..

Since the estimate of resources available is based on a forecast of output it has been thought more logical to show the gross national product directly. The division of the gross national product into its twocomponents, the national income and provision for depreciation and maintenance, which hasbeen made in previous years, is more appropriate to a forecast made from the side of income.The second departure from previous practice is to show the total of resources available at market prices.69. Total current expenditure on goods and services by all public authorities is expected to increase by about  190 million over the 1949 level. Expenditureon gross capital formation should be rather lower in 1950 than in 1949.Mention has already been made of the steps taken in the autumn of 1949 toreduce the rate of fixed capital expenditure by  140 million. There are many difficulties in bringing about a quick reduction in expenditure on fixed investment, and the full reductions in expenditure will not be achieved untilthe end of 1950. Consequently the investment actually achieved in the calendar year 1950 will fall below that carried out in 1949 by a smalleramount than  140 million. Stocks have grown considerably since the war,and, therefore, there should be less call to increase them further, so that expenditure on stock building should not be large in 1950.70. If Government current expenditure on goods and services and invest-ment, expenditure are at the level assumed above, the value of goods and services available for consumers will increase by some  200 million. are currence of inflationary pressure can be avoided if consumers do not seek to increase their expenditure by more than this amount.71. Consumers&apos; expenditure in 1950 will be limited to this amount providedthat the sums set aside from income, whether through the action of public authorities or by voluntary saving by companies or by persons, are sufficientto cover expenditure by public authorities and projected expenditure on grosscapital formation. Table 12 shows the revenue account of all public autho-rities on the assumption that current rates of taxation continue. It will beseen that, on these assumptions, the surplus of revenue over expenditure willbe little smaller in 1950 than in 1949. This surplus is brought together inTable 13 with estimates of the other sources of saving, and set against a forecast of total expenditure on gross domestic capital formation. It is to be noticed that the estimate of saving through profits put to reserve assumes thecontinuance of dividend limitation. There is no reliable direct information on the level of personal savings and the estimates in Table 13 are, for eachyear, simply the sums required to balance the account. They are affected,therefore, by all the errors made in estimating, or forecasting the other items in the account. For this reason great caution must be exercised in interpretingthe significance of changes in this item from year to year. Nevertheless, it isclear that, if inflation is to be avoided, the need for the highest possible rateof personal saving will remain at least as great in 1950 as in previous years.Revenue Account of Public Authorities!?)Table 12   millionReceipts	1948	1949	1950	Payments	1948	1949	1950Direct taxes on income Direct taxes on capital Indirect taxes Income from property	1,780 215 2,170 135	2,030 255 2,170 150	2,100 200 2,140 160	Current expenditure on goods and services ...

In 1949 supplies reaching the home market were supplemented by asmall surplus of imports over exports. It is important that this balanceof payments deficit should be eliminated in 1950, and a small surplus hasbeen allowed for. In this case more will be sent abroad than is received.Consequendy the total resources available for use at home will increase by only about  300 million. This compares with an increase of about  600million between 1948 and 1949. The amount of this increase available for extra consumption will depend on the level of Government expenditure on goods and services and of investment.National Resources and Expenditure 1949-50(&apos;)Table 11   million

On the other hand, output per manshiftat the face increased during the year and averaged 3.02 tons for the year asa whole or 3.4 per cent, more than in the previous year, exceeding themaximum pre-war level (2.90).(&apos;) Output per man shift is expected to continueto increase in 1950 as a result of further measures of reorganisation. Totaldeep-mined output in 1950 is therefore expected to be between 205 and 210million tons. Opencast production, which amounted to 12.4 million tons in1949, is expected in 1950 to increase to 13 million tons. Total supplies in1950 should, therefore, be between 218 and 223 million tons.73. Home consumption in 1949 was about 195 million tons, considerably less than expected partly because temperatures during the year were abovethe average. Home consumption requirements in 1950 are expected to be between 199 and 201 million tons. There should, therefore, be between 19and 22 million tons of cOal available for exports and bunkers.Coal Output, Consumption and ExportsTable 14 Million tons	1947	1948		1949			1950 (estimated)				Economic Survey for 1949	Actual (52 weeks)		Production -							Deep-mined	187-2	197	5	202-207	202	7	205-210&quot;Opencast ...	10-2	11	7	13	12	4	13Imports	0-7	0	1	 			 Total Supplies	198-1	209	3	215-220	215	1	218-223Home consumption 							Gas       .........	22-7	24	4	 	25	3	 Electricity         ......	27-1	28	8	 	30	0	 Railways          ......	14-6	14	6	 	14	7	 -Coke ovens      ......	19-8	22	3	 .	22	5	 Iron and steel   ......	8-7	8	7	 	8	4	 Other industry   ...	310	33	8	 	34	5	 .Domestic and  miscellaneous-							neous  ...	61 1	61	4	 	59	9	 Total.........	185-0	194	0	198-200	195	3	199-201Exports and foreign bunkers Change in total stocks Stocks at end of year -Distributed       ......

Other raw materials. Table 16 gives estimates of supplies to industry of some other important raw materials in 1949 and 1950. Since in most cases it is not possible to make allowance for changes in stocks in the.handsof industrial consumers, the figures for 1948 and 1949 give a somewhatimperfect indication of the volume of materials which industry actually74. It seems likely that in 1950 there will be continued difficulty in obtaining the necessary labour for certain pits and for certain areas (especially York-shire and the Midlands) which are the most productive. Special steps willhe taken but the task of securing enough man-power of the right type in thelight place remains considerable.75. Electricity. During 1949 700 megawatts of new generating capacitywas commissioned as compared with the 1,000 megawatts forecast in the lastSurvey. This slow progress was due to a continuing unbalance between thedifferent parts of the programme. Since scrapping of some old plant wasunavoidable, the net increase in available capacity was little more than600 megawatts.76. This was rather less than the estimated growth of unrestricted demand and with the colder weather the highest amount shed in the winter of 1949-50was actually about double the maximum shed in 1948-49. Generating plantcommissioned during 1950 is, however, likely considerably to exceed thenormal growth of demand and therefore the winter of 1950-51 should showsome improvement.  [See also paragraph        of the appendix on Investment.]77. Steel. The output of steel ingots and castings rose from 14.9 million tons in 1948 to 15.55 million tons in 1949 just over the upper figure of the range given in the last Survey. Imports of steel at 0.9 million tons were alittle lower and exports at 1.7 million tons rather higher than was expected.Total consumption of steel by home users in 1949 was about 10.36 millionfinished tons, of which about 48 per cent, went to the metal-using industries(engineering, shipbuilding, vehicles and miscellaneous metal industries) andmost of the remainder to various forms of constructional investment.78. Steel furnace capacity in operation will increase&apos; during 1950 by500,000 tons but not all the increase will be operative throughout the year.There is little further scope for more intensive utilisation of capacity so thatit is unlikely that steel production will increase as much in 1950 as it did in1949, and the output for the year is expected to be 15.75 million tons. Therewill, of course, be no question of keeping production down to this figure for it will still he necessary to make as much steel as the supply of raw materialswill allow.79. Domestic requirements are likely to be about 250,000 tons greater, interms of finished steel, than in 1949, since the reduction in the amount ofsteel used for constructional investment will be more than offset by the expected increase of 4-5 per cent, in the output of the metal-using industries.Exports will be considerably higher in 1950 than in 1949 ; there will be asubstantial increase in deliveries to the Commonwealth. To meet the total requirements of steel for export and for home consumption, it may be neces-sary to make some limited drawing on stocks.80. Fortunately, the stock position is good, for since the beginning of1948 total stocks of steel in the hands of producers merchants and consumershave increased by the equivalent of something like 800,000 finished tons. Itshould be possible without any dislocation or serious inconvenience to runthem down, if necessary, by some 300,000 tons and so meet any temporarydeficiency until 1951 when the supply and demand for sjeel should certainly be more nearly balanced. Supplies of sheet and tinplate will, nevertheless,be less than demand, and this deficiency will not be made good until thenew mills at Margam come into operation in 1951.

Agriculture. The expansion programme launched in 1947 was designedto raise agricultural output by 1951-52 to about 20 per cent, above 1946-47(roughly 50 per cent, above pre-war). Substantial progress was made in the crop year 1948-49 when conditions were exceptionally favourable and agri-cultural output was over 9 per cent, above 1946-47, when the expansion programme was launched. In 1949-50 conditions have only been moderatelygood, but preliminary estimates suggest a further increase of about 1  percent-O) The following table gives the main developments:  Agricultural Production in the United kingdom table 17			1949	-50		1947-48	1948-49	Pro-	Pre-	1950-51 (forecast)			gramme	liminary					estimate	Acreage (thousands) 					Bread grains.........	2,199 !	2,340	2,600	2,028	2,350Other grains.........	5,866	6,016	6,200	5,988	6,330Potatoes       .........	1,330	1,548	1,400	1,309	1,300Sugar beet     .........	395	413	400	420	416Linseed............	38	86	200	58	50Production (thousand tons) 					Bread grains.........	1,689	2,408	2,500	2,192	2,370Other grains   ...	4,514	5,508	5,330	5,633	5,640Potatoes	7,766	11,798	9,800&quot;	9,049	9,100 .Sugar beet	2,959	4,319	3,600	3,788	3,827Linseed............	15	35	100	23	20Livestock production (percentage					of pre-war) 					*Milk   ............	109	122	121	126	129Eggs    ............	86	100	108	111	118Beef and Veal         ......	83	87	93	87	102Mutton and lamb    ......	55	67	70	72	75Pig meat       .........	28	47	50	64	71(&apos;) The estimate for 1948-49 is provisional; that for 1949-50 is forecast.83. Within the total programme livestock production made better progressthan crops. Indeed, with the exception of sugar beet, almost all the main crop acreages were below target and less than the area sown in 1948-49.Crop yields generally were high, and in some cases offset the fall in the areasown, but the wheat crop was below that for 1948-49. Flocks and herdsof almost all kinds of livestock increased steadily, and the output of livestock products in many cases exceeded the programme.84. Plans for growing more fodder at home, to replace imported feeding-stuffs, are an important element of the Agricultural Expansion Programme.It is most difficult to measure statistically the progress made so far in thegrassland campaign, especially in view of the long drought in the summer of 1949. But great interest has been aroused among farmers and ultimatelya very large general improvement is expected in grass production and manage-ment and grass conservation. The number of grass, drying units increasedused. This is particularly evident for non-ferrous metals, where uncertaintiesabout future price movements seem to have lead the metal-using industries to reduce their purchases and draw from their stocks, so that for most ofthe metals purchases were lower than in 1948. For most of the materials in Table 16 the forecasts for 1950 represent the quantities for which provision has been made in making the import forecasts for the balance of paymentsestimates. The total volume of imports which will be obtained is inevitablyuncertain and the figures of raw material supplies are therefore somewhatspeculative.

68113 Economic Survey Galley 17notably ; but for the drought, silage production would have been substantially greater than in 1948, and there was progress in increasing grazing and thelength of the grazing season.85. An expansion of wheat acreage and production is expected in 1950,and the elimination of the feeding-stuffs subsidy will increase the incentive to grow grass and coarse grain. The calf-rearing subsidy has led to morecalves being kept for rearing, and a sharp increase in beef and veal production is likely. Pig-meat production is likely to be substantially higher than lastyear. But the number of breeding sows has not been increasing fast enough in the past year to maintain the programme rate of increase in the pigpopulation.86. The Engineering Industries(&apos;) About two-fifths of the exports of raanu-factured goods are made by the engineering industries and these are thereforeexpected to contribute substantially towards the higher level of exportsneeded in 1950.(&apos;) In this context these include mechanical and electrical engineering, electrical goods&apos;the manufacture of road and rail vehicles, scientific instruments and certain metal goods &apos;Shipbuilding, vehicle repairs and metal making are excluded.87. After the end of the war, there was a rapid rise in the output of theengineering industries as factories returned to their normal work. Thisphase has passed and future expansion of output depends mainly on increas-ing productivity. During 1949, however, output increased by 7 per cent,over 1948 and was 55 per cent, above 1946 or some 60 per cent, above 1938.Supplies of materials were generally sufficient to allow a free flow thoughcertain types of steel and special timbers were scarce.88. If the demand remains strong, as seems likely at present, the outputmay increase again by as much as 4 per cent, in 1950 without being limited by labour or materials. The demand for capital goods and durable consumer goods made by the engineering industries has, however, varied rapidly in thepast and it may be expected to decline as the pent-up demand from the war years is satisfied. But, although there may be changes in some sectors in sucha diverse field, no general slackening is expected in 1950.89. The demand for mechanical and electrical capital goods for export shouldbe strong, and the main danger is that the pressure of orders from home and non-dollar markets may prevent industry taking full advantage in the dollarmarkets (e.g. Canada) of the opportunities flowing from devaluation. Manu-facturers are giving priority to orders from North America and seeking thus to build up a market there.90. The capacity for making consumer goods in the engineering industryis ample for a substantial increase in exports without noticeably affectingsupplies to the home market and exporters should find fewer difficulties inselling abroad as a result of the steps taken towards a general freeing ofEuropean trade and of devaluation.91. In order to achieve the overall level of exports needed to balance ourpayments it is intended that supplies to the home market of gapital goods should be slightly less in 1950, so that the difference and any increase in output can be exported.92. In the motor vehicle industry both production and exports have in-creased rapidly since the war. Some 412,000 cars (nearly twice as many asin 1946) and 216,000 commercial vehicles (half as much again as in 1946)were produced in 1949. Exports of cars trebled and exports of commercial vehicles nearly doubled in the same period, and about 258,000 cars and93,000 commercial vehicles went overseas in 1949.93. In spite of the increase in exports, 1949 saw an increase in the rate ofsupply to the home market both of cars and of commercial vehicles. TheGovernment believe that there is more room for economies in this field of investment and consumption than in some others ; moreover one of the resultsof devaluation should be a further increase in the demand for exports. It istherefore intended to limit the supply of cars and to reduce the rate of supplyof commercial vehicles to the home market.94. Textiles. Production in both the wool and cotton textile industriesexpanded considerably in 1949 though in the latter industry the expansionwas not up to expectations. Compared with 1948 there were percentage increases of about 4 per cent, in production of cotton and synthetic yarn,5 per cent, for cotton cloth, 6 per cent, for worsted yarns and 7 per cent,for woven wool cloth. Exports of cotton piecegoods were nearly 20 per cent,higher than in 1948, but most of this increase was due to the export of foreigncloth imported for finishing. Furthermore, exports reached a peak in the first quarter of the year and thereafter declined. Exports of wool piecegoodswere still hampered by import restrictions in many foreign countries and,prior to devaluation, by price resistance and they showed no improvementover 1948. Exports of linen, more than 25 per cent, of which go to the UnitedStates and Canadian markets, declined somewhat in. 1949 due to price resistance-tance, the expectation that sterling would be devalued, and import restrictions in non-dollar countries.

Foicomparison with production figures, wool piece goods exports are converted here to linear yards at the appropriate conversion factor of 3 square for 2 linear yards; for cotton piece goodsthe difference between square and linear yards is currently negligible.95. In 1950, as in 1949, conditions will differ markedly in different branchesof the textile industry. In the cotton industry sufficient raw materials shouldbe available to allow a 3 to 4 per cent, increase in the production of cottonyarns in 1950 over 1949 provided full use can be made by the spinningindustry of the raw cotton available from non-dollar sources. Supplies ofstaple fibre should be sufficient to permit an increase of nearly 30 per cent,in spun rayon and mixture yarns.96. An increase of about 7 per cent, is expected in cotton and rayon clothproduction in 1950. This should be possible because supplies of cottonyarn to weavers will be higher than in 1949 and in addition there will beincreased supplies of continuous filament as well as spun rayon yarn. output per head in the weaving industry should be improved to some extent bythe further installation of automatic looms and by re-deployment on non-automatic looms. Progress here will largely depend on the rate at whichthe new wages structure recommended by the Cotton Manufacturing Corn-mission, and accepted by both sides of the industry at the end of last j&apos;ear,is brought into operation.97. A considerable increase is looked for in exports of cotton piece-goods to dollar and, in particular, Colonial markets. Exports to the formerwere disappointing in 1949 but it should not be beyond the industry&apos;s powerto effect a substantial improvement in 1950. The progressive introductionof the new wages structure referred to above, which makes the weavingof the wider simple cloths, largely required by the Canadian and Colonialmarkets, more remunerative to the operative than at present, would ensurethat the requirements of these markets aire met. A large part of the increasein exports during the past two years has been due to the re-export of Japanese&apos;grey cloth after finishing in Lancashire. The increase in weaving productionin the United Kingdom has been largely in types of cloth suitable for the domestic market or for industrial purposes. Imports of grey cloth willprobably be lower in 1950 that in 1949 and may be expected to declinefurther in later years.i98. Present indications are that if exports are increased as required in1950 the home market will get slightly more non-wool cloth and clothing in total in 1950 than in 1949, but within this total the proportion of rayonto cotton will be rising. Shortages of particular goods, for example goodexport lines, may continue but should not be serious.99. Production capacity for nylon at the end of 1949 was 10 million lbs.of yarn per year. Owing to initial difficulties output has been running at only half this rate but these difficulties are progressively being overcome.100. Devaluation has improved the competitive position of the UnitedKingdom wool industry in hard currency markets, but the demand for woolcloth there was falling in 1949. Prospects for exports to the U.S.A. in1950 are good but the prospects in Canada, a larger market for our exports,are less favourable. The United Kingdom already holds a large share of theworld market but exports could be still further increased if import restric-tions at present barring the way to many markets were removed. production should continue to rise in 1950 and supplies of wool cloth on the home market should continue to be adequate to meet demand.101. Activity in the jute industry was restricted during the first part of1949 by shortage of jute, a cut of 25 per cent, in allocations having to bemade from November, 1948. Activity increased during the latter part of1949, and during 1950 it is hoped that sufficient supplies will be availableto maintain consumption at slightly more than the level reached towards

The stability of the main totals in Table 19, the low level of unemploy-ment and the labour shortage in certain industries, may give a somewhatmisleading impression of rigidity in the pattern of production and lack ofmobility in the labour force. In fact, it is clear from the figures of placingsby the Employment Exchanges that there is considerable movement oflabour. In the course of 1949, the Employment Exchanges effected overA\ million placings which, when compared with a total industrial populationof about 22-]- million, suggests considerable mobility of labour. As mightbe expected, however, workers move much more readily within than betweenbroad industrial groups. The stability of the broad ipattern conceals infact greater changes in the pattern of production and employment within themain groups, although geographical mobility is still hindered by shortage of accommodation. Unemployment nevertheless remains very low partly becausethe labour market in the United Kingdom is highly organised, but also because the demand for labour is very high.(the end of the previous year. On the other hand there is a shortage in supplies of jute goods from India which has necessitated a reduction inallocations.i(b) Manpower102. The total working population was about the same in 1949 as in 1948.Since the numbers in the armed forces and on release leave fell during theyear, the industrial population increased slightly. Outside the development areas the amount of unemployment was extremely small.103. The general pattern of employment remained substantially unchanged.There was a slight fall in employment in basic and investment goods indus-tries and some increase in consumer goods industries and distribution,reflecting the increased material supplies for such industries as food and clothing. Although employment in local government services increasedslightly, there was a fall of 25,000 in the numbers employed by the centralGovernment. More labour was recruited into the textile industries and theincrease forecast in the last Economic Survey were substantially realised.Employment in coal-mining fell. Total employment in agriculture did notrise, but direct recruitment was reasonably satisfactory, and farmers werenot in general hampered by shortage of labour. Table 19 shows the distri-bution of the labour force at the end of 1949 and that forecast for the endof 1950.Distribution of Man-Power in Great Britain, 1948-50Table 19 Thousands

105. The final column of Table 19 gives a forecast, not of the require-ments of the industries listed, but of the changes in the distribution of theworking population which it is expected will &quot;take place, given the con-tinuance of present policies. The distribution expected is&apos; not in all respects the best which could be wished. Certain industries, such as coal, potteryand some branches of the textile industry, could usefully employ more labour,but large changes in the distribution of man-power should not be needed in 1950. None-the-less, constant effort will be necessary to offset wastagefrom some industries and to ensure that branches of industries and individualestablishments engaged on dollar-earning or dollar-saving production do not go short of the labour they require;106. The 1949 Economic Survey forecast a small decrease in the strengthof the Armed Forces: in fact the decrease was larger than expected.Similarly the increase in the number of civilians engaged on defence wassmaller than was anticipated. In 1950 a further decrease in the size of the armed Forces is planned but the numbers in industry engaged on defence work are expected to increase somewhat. The total call on man-power atthe end of 1950 is estimated to be about 1,420,000, of whom 685,000 will bein the Forces and Women&apos;s Services, 235,000 will be non-industrial civilservants in the Defence Departments or industrial staffs not directly engaged on production and research, and some 500,000 will be in industry, either directly employed by the Defence Departments or on contract work. Moredetails are given in the Statement on Defence, 1950 (Cmd. ),107. The analysis in Part II suggests that&quot; the pressure of home demandduring 1950 will continue to be high. Demand for exports is expected toincrease, but foreign importers are likely to become more discriminating asworld supply and demand for manufactured goods move closer into balance.Employment in the building and building materials industries and in public administration is expected to diminish. Provided that there is no generalcontraction in world economic activity, the labour so freed should in generalbe reabsorbed in other industries. The figure for unemployment in Table 19is not intended as a precise forecast but only to indicate broadly the levelthought to be likely.&apos;08. Reliance has been placed on persuasion rather than compulsion to guide labour to the more essential jobs. The main instnuiment used during1949 was the Control of Engagement Order, which requires workers between certain age limits to obtain any change of employment with the consent or through the agency of the Ministry of Labour. Workpeople registering for employment at the Employment Exchanges were offered as wide a choiceas possible of available employment suited to their industrial qualificationsin the &quot; first preference industries &quot;. They were not, however, compelled totake up such employment, if they were prepared to take other employment which, though not classed as first preference, was regarded as essential.Only where a person insisted on taking a job in a non-essential industryafter being offered a choice of four suitable jobs on essential work or askilled worker refused to remain in coal-mining or agriculture was the useof the power of direction considered. This policy of persuasion resulted in490,000 placings being made in first preference vacancies during 1949 (or12 per cent, of the total adult plaoings effected by the Ministry of Labour),while only 162 directions had to be issued during the same period. TheGovernment have extended the life of the Control of Engagement order for another twelve months. The previous restrictions on leaving employmentin coal-mining and agriculture were, however, removed at the beginningof 1950.(c) Fixed Investments109. Provisional estimates indicate that gross fixed investment was some 80- 100 million higher in 1949 than in 1948. Since there was little increase on the average in the price of investment goods the increase in expenditure&apos;represented an increase in the real volume of investment.110. It was suggested in the last Survey that in many of the sectors forwhich forecasts were given actual achievement was likely, for a variety of reasons, to fall somewhat short of the programmes. The estimates inTable 20 show that most of the forecasts did in fact over-estimate theamount of work which could be carried out. A more detailed accountof individual programmes will be found in Appendix I. But investment!in commercial and public service vehicles exceeded the original forecasts.Consequently total investment in the principal sectors did not differ greatlyfrom the forecast. It has already been pointed out that whole productionof vehicles grew substantially during 1949, the expansion of exports was much smaller.

When these measures are fully effective they willhave the effect of reducing the annual rate of investment by about  140million (below that orginally envisaged for 1950 and, as nearly as can be judged, by about the same amount below the rate current at the end of 1949.Changes in the rate of investment, can only be made slowly because thevolume of work for some months ahead is largely determined by commit-ments. The stoppage of building or the construction of plant and machineryon which work has begun is wasteful and disruptive. Work in hand will&apos;therefore be allowed to proceed, and for this reason the diminished rateof investment will not be achieved until the end of 1950. Consequentlycapital expenditure in the calendar year 1950 will exceed the rate to whichit is hoped to reduce investment in the second half of the year.111. In the revised programme new work has had to be reduced propor-tionately more than total investment because expenditure on maintenance and replacement forms a considerable part of gross investment in theUnited Kingdom and must, in many instances, have a first claim on invest-ment resources. Rather more than half the cuts imposed will fall on building and constructional work, and, excluding housing, nearly one-halfon work done for public authorities or nationalised industries.112. On the building side, the level of housing construction will bereduced from the figure of approximately 200,000 at the beginning of theyear to a figure of approximately 185,000. The reduction will fall more on licensed private building than on houses built by local authorities forletting. This fall is less than proportionate to the reduction in expendituresince a greater number of the -Smaller types of house are to be built andsome small economies are expected in other directions. Miscellaneousbuilding investment covers an exceedingly wide field of work, estimated to amount very roughly to  360 million. A proportion of it is maintenance and repair work on houses and commercial premises, much of which con-desists of jobs below the exemption limit for licensing. The saving by theend of the year of  25 million in the rate of expenditure in this field will&apos;require a substantial reduction both in new building and in maintenance work. Building and constructional work for other social services water,sewerage, health services, miscellaneous local government services, schools,universities, Home Departments&apos; services and broadcasting will be limitedapproximately to the rate achieved at the end of 1949. There will also be some economies in constructional work in the transport and communicationsfield. New building in manufacturing industry will be reduced by about 6 million, and this will help to diminish domestic demand for plant and&apos;machinery and so release it for export.113. It is intended that investment at home in engineering products shouldbe slightly less than in 1949, and that the products so released and thewhole of the increment in output in 1950 will be exported. This objectshould be achieved&apos; by some reduction in capital expenditure on plant and machinery by socialised industry, by some limitation of the present rateof industrial building, and by direct arrangement with the appropriatesections of the engineering industry.114. Previous Surveys have emphasised the need for giving first place to investment in those industries and basic services where increased outputor lower Costs will, directly or indirectly, assist the balance of payments.The reductions of investment described above will not interfere with thispolicy except to a minor extent. Details of the revised programmes aregiven in Appendix I.(d) Consumption115. Consumers&apos; expenditure is provisionally estimated to have increasedby about  250 million between 1948 and1 1949.

Expenditure on clothing, following the abolition of rationing, isestimated to have risen by about 11 per cent. After account is taken of price changes, the figures suggest that about 6 per cent, more clothing andfootwear was bought than in 1948. Some utility garments were scarcerthan non-utility, but clothing supplies were generally adequate to meetunrationed demand. The substantial increase in expenditure on household goods reflects the disappearance of shortages of many articles in this field.Supplies of household&apos;electrical goods and radios had already outrun demand at the end of 1948. In 1949 supplies of utility tfurniture increased by about25 per cent., and there were considerable increases in the supplies of floorcoverings and pottery. Shortages of all kinds of undeoorated domesticpottery, glassware (including vacuum flasks), galvanised hollow-ware andcast-iron cookingware, oil cooking appliances and paper goods generallyhad disappeared.117. The fall in spending on drink, tobacco and entertainment, has alreadybeen remarked iupon, as a sign that supplies of consumer goods wereincreasing moire rapidly than the amounts which consumers were willing orable to spend on them.118. If expenditure on food is revalued at 1948 prices no change is shownfcetween 1948 and 1949. Here again the total figure of expenditure concealsan improvement in the composition of the supplies which consumers bought.This is brought out by the following table which shows in physical unitsconsumption per head of some of the main food-stuffs in 1948 and 1949.Food Consumption in the United Kins damTable 22	Pre-war	1948 (provisional)	1949(a) Average daily intake per head 			Protein animal (gm.)......	42-7	41-1	42-0,,    -vegetable (gm.)	37-2	46-4	45-5,,    total (gm.).........	79-9	87-5	87-5Fat (from all sources) (gm.)......	130-2	107-6	118-4Visible fat (butter, margarine, lard, etc., fat content) (gm.)     ......				56-2	47-5	55-6Total energy value calories ...	3,000	2,890	3,000(A) Annual consumption in lb. per head -			Dairy products (milk solids)......	38-3	49-1	51-5Meat (edible weight).........	109-6	73-8	74-5Fish, game, poultry, etc. (edible weight)	32-8	37-2	35-4Eggs and egg products  (shell  egg			equivalent)   ...	24-0	21-3	22-4Oils and fats (fat content)    ......	45-3	38-1	44-6Sugar and syrups (sugar content)	109-9	85-3	90-4Potatoes	176-0	237-2	253-7Pulses and nuts	9-6	5-6	6-9Tomatoes and fruit (fresh equivalent)	141-5	137-4	1350Vegetables      ............	107-4	116-7	115-6Grain products         .........	210-1	249-4	244-6 *Tea, coffee and cocoa         ......	14-7	13-2	13-9119.

APPENDIXCAPITAL INVESTMENT IN 1950id) introductory. The following notes give a brief account of the progress in 1949and of the programmes and prospects for 1950 in the principal sectors offixed investment. The review is not intended to be exhaustive. It excludesa wide range of miscellaneous investment both in building and equipment for which detailed estimates cannot be made.(b) FUEL AND POWERCoal  million1948 1949 1950Deep-mined       ...............      23 27 33Opencast..................       3-6 3 1-92. Investment in 1949 included  6 million spent on new mines and majorreconstruction works ; the greater part of the remainder consisted in thepurchase of plant and machinery for mechanisation schemes andreplacements.3. The programme for 1950 provides for increased expenditure on newmines and reconstruction, both to expand the total output of certain areas and also to maintain output as uneconomic or worked out pits are closed.About three-quarters of the expenditure will be on plant and machinery.More efficient equipment and methods of working are being introduced as rapidly as passible to increase output, reduce costs and improve working conditions.   The standard of coal preparation is being steadily improved.Hard Coke  million1948 1949 1950Coke ovens       ...............       4 1 4-4 8-94. Increasing investment expenditure, both by the National Coal Boardand by the Steel industry, reflects the increasing demand for hard cokeby the steel and chemical industries, and the urgent need to replace obsoleteplants.Electricity(i) British Electricity Authority  million1948 1949 1950Generation        ............      ...      32-5 48-5 54-0Main Transmission       ............       3-3 5-0 5-0Distribution       ...............\   50.0 40-0 35-0Maintenance and repair..........:. J 10-6 8-0Total       ...............      85-8 104-1 102-05. Although the amount of new generating plant commissioned in 1949fell short of the programme, it approached the highest level ever&apos; achievedbefore the war ; the steps taken to speed up the rate of commissioning,including better phasing of the programme and progressing of raw materials and component.equipment, should secure better results next year.6. Even so, the increase in expenditure on generation will not yield sufficientcapacity to close the gap between available capacity and peak demandas quickly as was hoped last year, and if demand continues to grow as rapidly as in the past there is likely to be a deficit of capacity in relationto the winter peak load for several years. Until this gap is closed it willcontinue to be necessary to exercise strict economy in the use of electricityduring peak periods.7. The check to expenditure on distribution in 1950 represents a drasticslowing down in the programme, necessitated by the Governments decision that investment programmes for 1950 should be reduced. There is a large amount of work which will have to be carried out as soon as circumstances permit, in order to prevent deterioration of the service.(ii) North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board  million1948 1949 1950Total Investment...............       7-5 13-3 13-98. The Board&apos;s programmes provide for the installation of 393,000 kilowattsof generating plant by the winter of 1952-53. During the winter of 1949-50,50,000 kilowatts of generating capacity became available for supply to theBritish Electricity Authority; in the winter of 1950-51 an additional 135,000kilowatts capacity is expected to become available. The total expenditurein 1950 includes  9.5 million for generation,  .1 million for main trans-mission and  2.3 million for distribution.

As in 1948, the chief objects of capital expenditure in the gas industry during 1949 were to overtake arrears of maintenance and plant renewal andto meet steadily increasing demand. The increase in total gas manufacturing capacity during 1949 was approximately 5 per cent. Nationalisation of theindustry has enabled investment plans to be reviewed and co-ordinated soas to produce greater efficiency ; it is proposed to link the different areas by mains thereby enabling some less efficient works to be closed. Plans for substantial expansion have however had to be postponed.Petroleum  million1948 1949 1950Investment in the United Kingdom    ...... 9 16 3210. Work continued during 1949 on the expansion of four oil refineriesin the United Kingdom (SheH Haven, Stanlow, Llandarcy and Grangemouth)and a fifth refinery was started in July, 1949, at Fawley.- All these projects,and a sixth one on which it is expected work will start during 1950, willprobably be completed by the end of 1952, when the total refinery capacity in the United Kingdom will be about 18 million tons per annum.11. Work is expected to start in 1950 on an expansion of plant for makinganti-knock compounds containing tetraethyl lead. At present large quantitiesof these compounds have to be bought for dollars. Two plants for themanufacture of chemicals from petroleum started operations in 1949.(c) TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS^)Railways(2)  million	1948	1949	1950Way, Works and Structures     .........	25	28	Rolling Stock (renewals and additions)	28	29	Plant and Machinery (renewals and additions)...	2	3	Building and Civil Engineering Works......	10	10	Total       ...............	65	70	79			NumberUnit numbers constructed or purchased new 			Locomotives	410	400	400Coaching Stock	1,339	1,815	3,080Wagons         ...............	40,814	31,600	23,568			  millionLondon Transport Garages	0-5	0-6	2-3(&apos;) These figures are compiled on a different basis to that used in the Economic survey for 1949. They now exclude running repairs to rolling stock and permanent way repairs and maintenance.(2) And London Transport Executive garages.12. The gross book value of the total physical capital invested in railwaysis over  1,200 million, so that every year substantial expenditure is requiredfor depreciation and maintenance. Only a very small proportion of the verylarge annual total of investment expenditure goes to new development.13. Since the end of the war maintenance expenditure by the railways hasbeen severely limited and it has not been possible to carry out the programme for overtaking wartime arrears. In 1949 only a partial restoration of trackwas achieved, although where possible a few train services were acceleratedand extended. Necessary limitations on the supply of new carriages meant that some carriages which had broken down and passed their normal lifehad to be repaired and returned to service, involving higher costs of opera-tion. The stock of wagons also includes a large number which have passedtheir usual working life, and are expensive to operate, but these are beingslowly replaced.14. The effects of further cuts in investment which have been decided for1950 will be severe, although they will take some time to work out. new development may have to be restricted to the bare level required to carryout works already authorised.Road Vehicles			  million	1948	1949	1950Public Service Passenger vehicles	33	40	33Goods vehicles for road haulage	59	72	52Total       ............	92	112	85

There will be some rise in trunk road expenditure between 1949 and1950 because improvement schemes started before the reduction of the total programme will be allowed to continue. Apart from small improvementsurgently needed to improve conditions at danger spots, other work will ingeneral be restricted both on trunk and classified roads to what is necessaryto provide or maintain essential communications or is otherwise indispensable to other parts of the investment programme. Expenditure of  42.5 on road maintenance work in 1950 will allow only about 62 per cent, of the pre-warvolume of maintenance work per mile of road to be done. It will consequentlybe necessary for all highway authorities to allocate their limited resourcesvery carefully.Ports and Inland Waterways  million1948 1949 1950Ports:Building and civil engineering     ......        8-9 10-8 11-9Plant and machinery        .........       0-6 1-1 2-0Total    .........        9-5 11-9 13-9Inland Waterways............        1-6 1-6 1-718. Ports. During 1949 work continued on the construction of transitsheds at Liverpool and Southampton, the deep water quays at Leith, the dock improvements at Sunderland and the oil berths at Lackenby (RiverTees). The new Waterloo River Entrance Lock at Liverpool, which enablescoasting vessels to enter and leave the docks at all stages of the tide, was completed during 1949 and opened to traffic. An extensive scheme of reconstruction in the Canada dock system and adjacent docks at Liverpoolwas started in 1949 ; this scheme will take several years to complete. other major works authorised to start during the year included the new oil dockat Eastham (Manchester Ship Canal) in connection with the oil refinery atStanlow, and the construction of a new berth for a floating dry dock atFalmouth.19. The programme of port investment for 1950, although larger than therate achieved for 1949 and allowing for the most essential new works, will necessitate the postponement of a number of important schemes of improve-ment, including the rehabilitation of war-damaged quays and warehouses.20. Inland Waterways. No major works were undertaken during 1949 ;certain small schemes were carried out for the improvement of existingwaterways. In 1950 work will be concentrated particularly on improving themaintenance of depths on the waterways to make possible the better loadingof craft, and on the provision of better terminal facilities for loading and unloading,15. Although the home demand for the heavier types of bus is stillpressing, the needs of export and the general shortage of investment resourcesprovide a case for a reduction in the rate of supply of public service vehiclesfor the home market. Accordingly, the manufacturers have been asked toreduce the home sales to an annual rate of 8,000 as soon as possible, andnot later than the second half of 1950, compared with an annual deliveryrate of 11,000 during the second half of 1949. The proportion of light buses,of the type used for excursions and tours, will be reduced in favour of the heavier types.16. The goods vehicles fleet is now numerically sufficient to meet thecountry&apos;s basic needs. It is of course still necessary to maintain a supplyof new vehicles for replacement and development but it is hoped to reducesubstantially the present rate of supply to the home market. During thesecond half of 1949 these vehicles were being delivered to home users atan annual rate of well over 100,000. It is intended that this should bereduced to an annual rate of 65,000 ( 45 million) in the second half of1950. It will be impossible to get down to the reduced rate at once ; duringthe whole year 1950 about  52 million of vehicles will probably reach thehome buyers.Roads  million

More progress than had been anticipated was made during 1949 inthe re-equipment of B.O.A.C. Four additional Stratocruisers were acquiredand the delivery programme of the Canadairs was accelerated so that B.O.A.C.were able to introduce more of these aircraft into service during the year than had been expected.22. The rate of replacement during this year should show a substantial reduction, since the present stage in the re-equipment of B.O.A.C. has made considerable progress.23. The volume of work done on the aerodrome construction programme in 1949 was slightly lower than had been planned. In 1950 the level of investment will be raised but will continue to be confined mainly to workwhich is essential for maintaining international air services and for increasingthe safety of air transport. At London Airport, where the volume of inter-national traffic continues to expand steadily, there will be further work onthe runways system and also a special concentration on the provision ofhangars and technical accommodation. These are necessary to accommodate the new aircraft being brought into service by the British Airways Corpora-tions and will facilitate the centralisation of aircraft operations and main-tenance thus contributing towards greater efficiency and economy of operation.ShippingThousand gross tons completions^&apos;)		1948	1949	1950Dry cargo and passenger	Home	635	656	537vessels           ......

Repairs counted as home investment are estimated at  15 million in 1948, 10 million in 1949 and  5 million in 1950. The values for new construction are for comple-tions of vessels of 100 gross tons and upwards for home owners; the progress of this investmenteach year together and the value of the capital repairs and of vessels under 100 gross tons(estimated at  1 million a year) is shown in Table XIX.24. In 1949 the output of ships was 1,361,000 gross tons. Better suppliesof steel and timber together with the freer flow of equipment and component parts enabled the shipyards to speed up the work of construction at all stages. One-third of the tonnage completed in 1949 was for export andtwo-thirds*for British owners. In 1950 the proportion of tankers to total tonnage built will be even higher than in 1949. The gross tonnage of ships to be completed in the year, excluding those of less than 100 tons, isestimated to be 1,300,000 tons, valued at  95 million. As in 1948 and1949, two-thirds of the tonnage built is expected to go to British owners.Of this, it is estimated that 537,000 tons will be dry cargo and passengervessels and 273,000 tons tankers, with the balance made up principally oftrawlers, barges, tugs, whale-catchers and dredgers. Of the dry cargo and passenger vessels to be completed in 1950 for British owners, 400,000 grosstons will replace tonnage going out of commission through loss orobsolescence. The net addition to the dry cargo fleet by the end of theyear will be about 140,000 gross tons.25. The British tanker fleet is already larger than in 1939 and is expectedto reach 3.8 million gross tons by mid-1950. The European countries whichtraditionally charter their tankers to British oil interests are also increasing their fleets, much of their tonnage being built in British yards. The com-bined effect of these building programmes has enabled the British-controlledoil companies to reduce their expenditure of dollars on chartering tankers.26. In 1948, dollar expenditure on chartering by the British-controlled companies amounted to $27.5 million. In 1949, the total dollar charteringexpenditure of the British-controlled companies was only $9 million.27. The anticipated increase in the world trade of the British companiesmeans, however, that tanker construction continues to be of great importanceCivil Aviation  million

Most of this expenditure is on the telephone service. The programme for 1950 represents an appreciable reduction in volume of investment becausehigher prices are having to be paid for equipment. The Post Office willcontinue severely to restrict its purchases of telephone equipment, since this equipment is a valuable export.29. Under the restricted programme the list of applicants waiting fortelephones is expected to continue to grow longer; it already had reached550,000 at the end of 1949. As in 1949, the needs of industry, commerce and other essential telephone users will continue to receive priority and onlya small proportion of residential applicants will be able to obtain telephone service.30. The margin of spare plant in the Post Office system is small, and steps are being taken to make the full use of existing equipment; in thisconnection, much importance is attached to new cross-connecting devices,designed to provide greater flexibility in the underground cable plant, and aconsiderable extension of the sharing of one telephone line by two subscribers.31. The building programme will be mainly work on the new importanttelephone schemes.id) AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIESAgriculture and Fisheries			  million	1948	1949	1950Agriculture (GreaOBritain):			Building (including farm draining  and			water supplies)          ...      ...      ...     &quot;...	23-9	27-7	30-4Machinery and equipment          ......	53-2	49-3	45-4Total    .........	77-1	77-0	75-8Arterial Watercourses	3-3	4-1	4-5Fisheries   ...	0-6	0-6	1-132.

The prosecution of the agricultural expansion programmerequires increased investment in permanent equipment, such as more build-ings for more livestock, improved water supplies and drainage, the latterparticularly for grassland development. On the other hand, farmers&apos; demands for farm machinery and other portable equipment have somewhat declined.33. Arterial water courses. A number of new major projects have beenpromoted by Catchment Boards, but a reduced rate of investment of  5.millions in 1950 will in some cases delay the start and slow down the rateof work. Schemes already well advanced will not be affected by the cutsin investment.34. Fisheries. Investment in the fishing industry (other than for new fish-ing vessels and fishing gear which does not appear in this programme) in-cludes war damage, plant for ice production for fishing vessels, improvements and reconditioning of fishing harbours and research and development pro-jects carried out by the Herring Industry Board, and represents investment of about  1 million a year.Forestry  million1948 1949 1950Forestry Commission    ............       4-6 4-4 4-9Private woodlands        ............       2-3 2-5 2-7TotalC).........       6-9 6-9 7-6(&apos;) Since planting and upkeep are, for statistical purposes, treated as work in progress,only about  1 million in each year is treated as capital investment.35. At present the country&apos;s resources of growing timber are negligible.Most of the convertible timber has gone and much that is immature isstill having to be cut, and it is important that the reserves of home-growntimber should be increased. The programme of work to be done in 1950is similar to that planned and achieved in 1949.

The monthly rate of completion of houses in1949 averaged 14,000 with minor seasonal fluctuations from month to month.The total number of permanent houses completed during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1949, was 172,000.42. Work was started on new houses at a fairly constant rate month bymonth, and at roughly the same rate at which houses were being completed.At 31st December, 1949, there were 200,000 building and civil engineeringoperatives engaged on new house building and the number of houses under construction was 164,000. The average time required to build a normaltraditional type of house was about eleven months.43. An accurate estimate of the total expenditure on repairs, maintenance and conversion of existing houses is not possible since much of the workdoes not require a licence and is generally undertaken by small firms ofprivate builders on behalf of private individuals. The estimated reductionin the total expenditure in this field for 1950 assumes that there will be somecurtailment of the issue of building licences for works which require them,i.e., those costing over  100.  million1948 1949 1950Total investment ............ 35 45 5036. The year 1950 will be one of continued construction for the various schemes included in the .Steel Industry&apos;s Development Programme. Therewill be some additions to production resulting from the completion of newcoke-ovens, blast furnaces, steel-making furnaces, and rolling mills, theconstruction of which was begun soon after the end of the war. blast furnace capacity should increase by about 575,000 tons, and steel-making capacity by about 400,000-500,000 tons.37. The main scheme in the Development Programme, the erection of anew integrated plant at Margam in South Wales for the production of sheetand tinplate, is making steady progress. A new blast furnace will comeinto operation in 1950 and the remainder of the plant will come into production in 1951.Other Manufacturing Industry  million1948 1949 1950390 400 40038. For 1949 as a whole the volume of new building work, from whichthe progress of investment in manufacturing industry can, at present, be most effectively gauged, was greater than in 1948. As in 1948 emphasiswas laid on those projects which were likely either to encourage exports,especially to North America, or to diminish the need to import goods from difficult currency areas, special attention being given to projectsdesigned, not merely to increase capacity, but to lower costs of production.Within these limitations, room has been found for substantial and pro-gressive improvements in re-equipment and modernisation as well asexpanded capacity in many industries, including chemicals, textiles, pottery,paper, printing and several branches of engineering. In the development areas nearly 10 million square feet of factory space was occupied during1949. .39. Licences have been issued in 1949 only to projects satisfying the criteria laid down in the Economic Survey for 1949 (Cmd. 7647, para-graph 43) ; these criteria have strict regard to the needs of economic recovery.Nevertheless, at a time when investment resources are quite insufficient tomeet all demands upon them, some contribution must be sought in this field. The consequent reduction will fall partly upon building and partlyupon plant and machinery. As, however, the amount of work actuallystarted in 1949 was high, the reduction will not be achieved until the endof the year 1950.40. In the plant and machinery field, it is important, for reasons given inparagraph 91 of the main body of this Survey, that manufacturing resources should be used increasingly to support the export markets, especially dollarand other hard currency countries ; suppliers are accordingly being urged to expand their sales abroad.

44. Scotland. During 1949 a further marked reduction in the volume ofunfinished housing work took place. The number of permanent houses com-pleted, which had risen from 12,000 in 1947 to 21,000 in 1948, rose again to 25,900 in 1949.45. In 1950 it is proposed to reduce housing expenditure partly by increasingthe proportion of houses of the smaller sizes in approved schemes, partly by reducing the number of licences to be issued for the building of houses by private enterprise and partly by effecting building economies which canbe combined with the maintenance of approved standards of construction and accommodation.(g) OTHER SOCIAL SERVICESHealth Services, Water and SewerageEngland and Wales  Hospitals and welfare services(l) ...

The actual expenditure on this group of services during 1949 proved to be somewhat less than the approved programmes forthat year.47. Owing to the changes in hospital administration in 1948 and uncertainty about the amount of money available for hospital purposes, the rate ofcapital investment fell noticeably in the first six months of 1949 but began to rise again in the latter half of the year. In 1950 building will continueto be confined to modernising and adapting existing hospitals and no newhospitals will be built during the year. A continued shortage of cast ironpipes and steel tubes has meant that the progress made on water supply and sewerage schemes during 1949 has been somewhat less than the authorisedprogramme, but many of the schemes which were put in hand during 1949will run on into 1950 and beyond.48. Miscellaneous looal government services include sea defence and a wide range of minor works. These are on a small scale, but often of some local importance.49. The programme for these three groups of services has, in the year 1950,been put at a combined figure of  39.4 millions. Within that total there willbe some increase in the total expenditure on hospitals as compared with theactual expenditure in 1949 though the rate of investment will not be allowedto exceed that for the latter half of 1949, and some decrease in the expendi-ture on water supply and sewerage and miscellaneous local government services.50. Scotland Health Services. The same considerations apply to thesefigures as for England and Wales.51. Scotland Water Supply and Sewerage. Investment in 1949 wascarried out according to plan. Most of it was for water supply schemes. Ithas been decided that, in existing circumstances, it is not possible to let theyearly rate of investment rise above  3.2 million for 1950.Education  million	1948	1949	1950England and Wales 			New places in primary and secondary			schools	12	16-5	30Technical Education        .........	0-7	1-5	3-5School meals         ............	3	4	1-other new work (including plant and machinery)	3-7	9	6-5Maintenance	3	3	3Total    .........	22-4	34	44- scotland 			New places in primary and secondary			schools    ...      ......	2-25	2-6	2-45School meals	0-4	0-6	0-45Technical education	005	0-25	0-35Other work (including approved schools)	0-25	0-2	0-2Maintenance	0-6	0-7	0-65Total    .....	3-55	4-35	4-15Universities	2-5	3-5	4-5

Nearly all the investment in this field is on building for the needs ofthe Police, Prisons and Borstal Institutions, Children&apos;s Homes, ApprovedSchools (in England and Wales), Remand Homes, Probation Hostels andHomes, and Fire Services, excluding houses for staff which are included inthe housing programme. The main emphasis continues to be on maintenance and adaptations but some new building is essential: many buildings are inadequate or unsuitable for present needs, more accommodation is required and requisitioned premises have to be replaced.B.3J.C.			  million	1948	1949	1950Building and civil engineering ...	0-4	0-6	0-7Plant and Machinery	0-4	0-7	1-0Total    ......	0-8	1-3	1-757. Because of the current necessity to avoid making heavy demands on investment resources, investment in 1950 will be confined for the most partjo the extension of television. The B.B.C.&apos;s intention is to start work in1950 on relay stations to serve the North of England and the South ofScotland. A third station will be started to serve S. Wales and partof the West of England. Amongst other projects work will take placeon television studios in London, and on the conversion of premises to provide accommodation for the Corporation^ Overseas Service.(fi) DEFENCE AND ADMINISTRATIONDefence			  million	1948	1949	1950Service Departments(&apos;) -			Building	20	28	33Plant and machinery	2	2	2Total    .....	22	30	35(&apos;) excludes (a) expenditure on armaments and warlike stores, and (b) permanent married quarters, which are included in the National Housing programme.58. In 1949 the Admiralty continued their extensive repair andmaintenance work, particularly in dockyards and at air stations. Owinglargely to staff shortages and unexpected delays in beginning some of thelarger schemes, progress on new works has been slower than had been hoped.52. England and Wales. In 1949 educational building expanded rapidlyto meet essential needs. The value of work started was nearly double the1948 figure but, as much of this work was started later in the year than hadbeen expected, actual expenditure fell short of the amount forecast by 4 million.During 1950 the programme will continue to expand but there will be anincreased concentration of resources on the most urgent tasks. These areto provide the new school places needed for children of statutory school ageas a result of new housing developments and the high birthrate of the years1944-48, and the extension of facilities for technical education which is essen-tial to the improvement of efficiency in industry and commerce.53. In order to concentrate available resources on meeting these require-ments, it has been necessary to postpone the extension of the school mealsservice at existing schools and to defer a number of minor works which,though very desirable, are not essential to the efficiency of the education service. Savings will also be made in the field of school and technical collegebuilding by reducing costs. The cost of school buildings started in 1950 willbe reduced by about 12J per cent, on the 1949 average and further economiesare planned for 1951. The aim is to obtain more school places for lessmoney by building schools of good quality more simply than hitherto.54. The volume of other work, the most important of which is for teachers&apos;training colleges and special schools for handicapped children, will be small.Here too the aim will be to reduce costs and to restrict work to projects of special urgency.55. Scotland. The problems in Scotland, resemble very closely those ofeducation in England, and the general policy for 1950 will be the same as for England.Services Administered by Home Departments  million

In 1949 investment in Government building fell substantially short of the proposed limit of  26.4 million. This was due mainly to difficultiesin obtaining sites for new office and other buildings, and to a reductionin expenditure on camps and hostels, as well as to readjustments in other directions.62. In 1950 work will continue on the construction of new offices, mainly of light or semi-permanent construction, in order to replace requisitionedpremises. The reduction of this kind of investment will, however, make itimpossible to replace all requisitioned premises by the end of 1952 ashad been hoped. Permanent office building will be restricted in the mainto those schemes to which the Ministry of Works was already committed in the autumn of 1949, though preparations will continue for the newColonial Office, on which little will be spent before 1953.63. Expenditure on camps and hostels will be limited to that necessaryto complete work in band. Work on the new House of Commons will becontinued and almost completed, and there will be some increase onlaboratories for scientific and industrial research. It will be necessary toreduce slightly expenditure on the maintenance of Government buildings.(0 NORTHERN IRELAND64. Capital investment in Northern Ireland is not set out in detailbecause much of it is subject to control by the Northern Ireland Govern-ment. There has been consultation between the two Governments to ensurethat the programmes are related to the resources available and that theyare in harmony with the general principles governing the correspondingprogrammes for Great Britain, bearing in mind the leeway which exists between some services in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in GreatBritain.   Investment is expected to be about  36 million.Essential repairs and maintenance of pre-war installations and temporary war-time buildings accounted for the greater part of the expense incurred by theWar Office and Air Ministry.59. In 1950 maintenance will continue to be a heavy drain on theavailable resources of all three Service Departments. The major worksprovided for relate mainly to air fields, research and development estab-lishments, harbour works and dredging for the Admiralty ; to storage and work-shop accommodation for the War Office and to air field and otherdevelopment work necessary for operational efficiency for the Air Ministry.60. The Ministry of Supply undertakes work for defence purposes, mainly in connection with research establishments and Royal Ordnance Factories.The estimated expenditure in 1950 is  28 million.Government Building
