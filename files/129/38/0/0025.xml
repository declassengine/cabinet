THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRET Copy No.     3 j[CP. (50) 252nd March, 1950CABINETTHE DERATIONING OF ANIMAL FEEDING STUFFSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Secretary of Statefor scotland. When the Government decided in October last that the remainingExchequer subsidy on animal feeding stuffs should be eliminated from thebeginning of the next financial year (1st April, 1950), they also asked that the agriculture Ministers should arrange for the possibility of derationing feedingstuffs, either entirely or partially, to be explored.2. The Agricultural Output Committee (comprising officials of the Agricul-ture Departments, Treasury (including Central Economic Planning Staff),Ministry of Food and Economic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat) have accordingly examined this question3. Although rationing has a number of serious disadvantages and its dis-continuance would release a staff of about 1,500 in the Ministry of Food and agriculture Departments, the objections to early derationing are too strong toenable the Committee to recommend this course.The main objections are : (a) Future supplies are in doubt.  Purchases in Argentina in recent months have been appreciably less than was contemplated last summer, andthe crop of Argentine maize that will shortly be harvested is reportedto be light. Russia, the other main supplier, is always an uncertainquantity.(b) It would be impossible to direct supplies of feeding stuffs to those classesof livestock which in the national interest should have priority.(c) If feeding stuffs were derationed it would be difficult to retain price control, and this would have repercussions on the present methods of fixing and operating guaranteed prices for meat, milk and eggs.(d) It would probably be necessary to allow a resumption of private trading in feeding stuffs as a prelude to derationing. This would be difficultat short notice and a new method would have to be devised for implementing guaranteed prices for home-grown barley, oats and rye.4. The Agricultural Output Committee accordingly recommend, and we agree, that in the present supply situation immediate derationing would involvetoo big a risk of further substantial price rises and of upsetting the balance ofour agricultural production among different commodities.5. We recommend instead that steps should be taken to distribute the unusedsurplus of feeding stuffs arising from the tendency of some farmers not to buyup to their individual entitlements. This tendency may well be accentuated withthe rise of feeding stuff prices that will follow the elimination of the subsidy.The best method seems to us to alter the scales of coupon issues so as to increasethe entitlements of some of those classes of farmers who would at present buymore feeding stuffs if allowed to do so.   We should propose to increase these38374
entitlements progressively, starting with an increase of entitlements to pig rationsby, say, 500,000 tons a year. From experience of the proportion of these extraentitlements actually taken up we could then assess whether it would be safe to deration at a later date.6. In operating this proposal it would be necessary to pay continuous regardto the volume of supplies from overseas and the means of paying for them. Itwould, however, put less potential strain on the import programme thanderationing and we accordingly recommend its adoption to our colleagues.J. C. E.T. W.H. McN.2nd March, 1950.
