LOCAL C-OVERNMSNl? BOUNDARY EXTENSIONSMemorandum by the Minister of HealthMy colleagues will remember that, during the debates on the Local Government Boundary Commission (Dissolution) Billon 2nd and. 9th November,  19^-1-9,  I made it clear on behalf of theGovernment that they themselves were considering the wholequestion of the structure of local government and that conse-quently they would in the meantime resist any proposals formaterial alterations in the areas and status of local author-it ies.      Notwithstanding this definite expression of view,sixteen county borough councils and one borough council havepromoted Bills for substantial extension of boundaries and twoborough councils (Luton and Ilford) are seeking County boroughstatus.       (In addition two Bills were promoted but withdrawn onthe reiteration of the Government&apos;s general views.)2. Our deliberations on this subject were interrupted by, the Election.      Clearly, however, we must sooner or- later, takeI the matter into consideration again and-settle our policy, withla view to introducing legislation as soon as circumstances permit.      Until we can do so, it is highly desirable that weshould make every endeavour to maintain existing conditions,except where limited extensions are urgently needed, e.g.  for housing purposes.3&quot; I have accordingly taken steps on Second Reading inthe Commons to block the private Bills commencing there,  andwould propose to do the same if need be when the Bills commencingin the Lords reach the Commons.      It is probable that  in conse-quence most of the promoters will amend their Bills and limit their extensions to urgent needs.      One or two may, however, try to pursue the Second Reading of their Bills.h. The two boroughs, Luton and Ilford, will be reluctant to abandon their attempt to secure higher status.       If Lutonbecame a county borough it would have a most serious effect onthe viability of Bedfordshire and (apart from the general objec-tion because of the Government&apos;s review)  ought not to be con-siclered in the absence of an examination of the county and itssurroundings.      As for Ilford,  its status ought not to be looked at apart from the Greater London problem.      Both Bills aretherefore open to objection from local as well as from generalGovernment con siderations.5. I propose, therefore, if my colleagues agree, tocontinue where necessary to block the Bills,  and, if the promoters persist, to ask the House on Second Reading debate to reject the Bills on the ground that only urgent changes shouldbe made piecemeal pending the result of the Government&apos;consideration of the general question.A.
