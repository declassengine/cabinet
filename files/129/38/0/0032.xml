2. After paragraph 30, insert new paragraphs as follows:--    &quot;The, Roles of Marshall AidThroughout 1949 the economic life of the UnitedKingdom was closely bound up with the development of theEuropean Recovery Programme.      Reference bias already beenmade to the freeing of the flow of trade inside western europe which has been one of the outstanding achievementsof European economic co-operation.      The volume of this trade increased by one-fifth during 194-9 and in the last quarter of the year was about 10 per cent above the pre-war level.      The wider opportunities thus afforded for the. E. E. G.   countries to help one another through theexchange of their products have greatly assisted theprogress of recovery throughout Western Europe.      Exportsof coal, machinery, vehicles, chemicals and other manu-factures from the United Kingdom have enabled othercountries to raise their industrial and agricultural production, and they in turn have been providing theUnited Kingdom with steadily increasing quantities offood and industrial materials, some of which have replaceddollar Imports.      At the same time Marshall Aid has made it possible for Western Europe to go on obtaining from dollar sources essential supplies not available elsewhere.Without these supplies the 0. E. E. G.   countries could never have pushed ahead in 1949 with the massive task of reconstruction and development which was undertaken afterthe end of the war.14 per cent of all United Kingdom imports werefinanced by Marshall Aid in 1949, representing 2.6 percent of the gross national product.      Large items paid for in this way included one-third of all wheat and flour,including home production,  one-quarter of sugar,  one-tenth of bacon, one-quarter of petroleum,  one-third of copper and zinc, four-fifths of virgin aluminium,  one-sixth of load,  one-fifth of wood and timber, two-fifths of raw cotton,  one-half of tobacco and one-eighth of paper-making materials, (bThese supplies have provided a general support to the whole United&quot; Kingdom economy,  and without them itwould have been impossible either to achieve the steady-expansion of industrial production which took place in 1949or to sustain so large a programme of capital investment.It is seldom feasible specifically to relate commodities services received under E. R. P.  to particular recoveryprojects.       It is, however,  safe to say that there is nota single industry or district in the country which has notbenefited in some way from American aid.It has,- of course, never been envisaged that theUnited Kingdom should continue indefinitely to rely on thegenerosity of the United States taxpayer, and all effortsmust be concentrated on the task of achieving full economicindependence by the time that Marshall Aid ends in 1952.That is the central aim and purpose of the european recovery Programme.      At the  same time,   in going on to con-sider the United Kingdom&apos;s prospects in 1950, it is necessaryto bear in mind that these prospects depend upon the contin-uar.ce of American aid, though on a diminishing scale,  duringthe next two years.      This is a basic assumption underlyingeverything that is said in the following pages about thebalance of payments, production,  investment and consumption._____----__(1) A full list of commodities and services received underMarshall Aid is published every three months in thequarterly Reports on Economic Go-operation.

Delete existing paragraphs 7k- and 75 and substitute: -&quot;The outlook for manpower in the coal mining industry is closely bound up with the question of improvingamenities within the industry.      This problem has receivedthe closest attention from the National Coal Board, whoare devoting large sums to the improvement of undergroundconditions, the installation of additional pithead bathsand canteens,  the extension of training schemes and theestablishment of scholarships for advanced technical training.      During 19u9 juvenile recruitment (confinedalmost entirely to the mining areas)  increased to 1h,000,an improvement of some 3,000 over the previous year.Concurrently with this process, a wide-spread further improvement in technical methods and consequent re-deployment In labour undertaken by the National coal board made it possible to effect an overall economy in manpower in a period marked by a substantial increase in output.      The main problem in 1950 will be to secure thatthere shall be sufficient labour for particular pits  inthose areas (especially Yorkshire and the Midlands) whereproductivity is highest and costs of production lowest.Special steps will be taken but the task of securingenough manpower of the right type at the right placeremains considerable.Electricity - Although it did not prove possible to achieve the addition of 1,000 megawatts of new generating capacity that was forecast in the last Survey, new turbo-alternators installed during 19h9 amounted to 823 mega-watts - the highest figure ever reached in this country.Mainly owing to the different rates of progress in theseveral industries concerned in the supply of the equip-ment to the British Electricity Authority,  the actual new capacity commissioned was 703 megawatts.The increase achieved was somewhat  less than theestimated, growth in unrestricted demand but the special measures taken to even out peak demand and to concentratesupplies at points where they were most needed ensuredthat there was no serious interruption in essential supplies.      Turning to 1950,  a further substantial improvement may be expected,  for the amount of new gener-atingcapacity expected to be commissioned will exceed,the growth of demand.      The outlook for the winter of1950/51  is, therefore, brighter than for any winter sincethe end of the war. &quot;!(Ministry of Fuel and Power)Delete existing paragraph 78 and substitute:-&quot;Steel furnace capacity in operation will increase during 1950, but &quot;the rate of increase of output in 1950 will not be as great as in 1SU9, because oflimitations on supplies of raw materials, and Is expectedto be between 15.75 and 16 million tons. &quot;- Delete last sentence of paragraph. 80 and substitute:-&quot;Supplies of sheet and tinplate will, however, be lessthan demand.      The deficiency of tinplate will not bemade good until the new mills at Margam and Trostre comeinto operation in 1951 ;    that of sheet will &quot;be greatly reduced when the new mills at Margam come into operation in 1951, but not entirely made good until the extensionsat Shot toil are completed in 1952.&quot;Table 15, column 5, amend &quot;15,750&quot; to road,750 - 16,000&quot;.

7. Insert new footnote  (3) referring to last two items in Table 15, as follows:-&quot;Production of finished steel is always less than total production of crude steel because of processing.&quot;(Ministry of Supply)8. Delete paragraph 103 and substitute;-&quot;The final column of Table 19 gives a forecast,not of the requirements of the industries listed, but ofthe changes in the distribution of the working population which it is expected will take place.      Certain industries,such as coal, pottery and some branches of the textile industry,  could usefully employ more labour, but largechanges in the distribution, of manpower should not be needed in 1930.      None the less, constant effort will benecessary to reduce and offset wastage from some industries and to ensure that branches of industries and individual establishments engaged on dollar-earning ordollar-saving production do not go short of the labourthey require. &quot;9. Delete existing paragraph 108 and substitute:-&quot;Reliance has been placed on persuasion ratherthan compulsion to guide labour to the more essentialjobs.      During 191+9, under the Control of EngagementOrder, workers between certain age limits were requiredto obtain any change of employment with the consent,  or through&apos; the agency of the Ministry of Labour and RationalService.      There have been progressive relaxations in theadministration of the Order,  and the practice of givingdirections to specified work in order to support its administration has been almost entirely in abeyance.Special restrictions on leaving employment in coalminingand agriculture were removed at the beginning of 1950,and in March the whole Control of Engagement Order was withdrawn and the use of the powers of direction com--pletely discontinued. &quot;(Ministry of Labour)10. After paragraph 111 ,  insert new paragraph as follows:-&quot;During 191+9, 337 new factories and extensionswere completed, in the Development Areas, bringing thetotal number built in these areas  since 191+5 up to 967.&quot;(Board of Trade)11, Delete existing paragraph 119 and substitute;-&quot;Rood consumption in 1949 greatly improved.      Inalmost every section greater quantities and varieties offood became available.      Only the consumption of meat and sugar remained lower than before the war.More oils, fats and eggs were eaten, while therewas a decline in the consumption of flour - developments which clearly indicate that our national diet in 191+9 was more tasteful and attractive.Liquid milk consumption &quot;was nearly 6 per cent higher than in 191+8.      We used .15 per cent more tats(butter, margarine, lard) than in the previous year, andactually got to about 3 per cent below the general pre-war level.

It must be made clear, however, that these broadcomparisons do not bring out the most  significant fact  ofThat fact - and it is of immense socialsignificance - is that there has been a great levellingout of food consumption among the various classes  of thepopulation since the war.      This change is the result ofthe redistribution of income, rationing,  subsidies and price control. &quot;(Ministry of Pood)12.

Housing.As in paragraphs hh/h5 of the Appendix.Water and Sewerage.In 194-9 progress on schemes was well up to expecta-&apos;.tion.      The Department are aiming to complete a programme of 60 -  65 million in fifteen to twenty years.      The bulk ofthis investment is in respect of water supply, on whichindustrial development, the housing programme and the improve-merit of existing housing conditions;, particularly in rural areas, in large measure depend.Health, and welfare services.In 1950 the programme will be increased slightly but will still consist mainly of adaptations and re-equipment at existing hospitals.Education.The main building problems are to provide school places for children in the new housing areas and for the largenumber of additional children who will reach the schools as aresult of the high birth-rate following the war.      As muchbuilding as possible to meet these needs will be accomplishedwithin the permitted allocations of expenditure;    and further provision will be made for developments in technical education.Education authorities have been given detailed advice aboutreductions in school costs in order that the available moneymay provide as many school places as possible.Home Department.Most of this investment is on buildings for thepolice, fire and prisons services, children&apos;s homes, remandhomes, probation hostels and local authority offices.      Itexcludes houses for staff, as these are included in the housing programme.      The main emphasis continues to be on maintenance and adaptations.Ei fisheries.Investment in the fishing industry (other than forvessels and fishing gear, which does not appear in this pro-gramme) includes improvements and reconditioning of fisheryharbours and research and development projects carried out bythe herring industry board.North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.million19hS 1949 1990Total Investment 7*5 13.3 13.9The Board&apos;s programmes provide for the installation of 393,000 kilowatts of generating plant by the winter of1932-33.

The total expenditure in 1950 includes  9*5 million for generation,  2.1 million for main transmission and  2.3 million for distribution.

ANNEX BThe vicissitudes of the past few years have notprevented steady and rapid progress towards most of the funda-mental objectives of national economic policy.      1947 was ayear of great difficulty:    1948 of steady advance:    1949 of less even progress, marked as it was by.the devaluation crisis;But throughout these years the volume of production grew fast,and so, with some fluctuations,  did the level of exports.Indeed both achievements considerably surpassed expectations.In the Bong Term Programme (Cmd.  7572), published inthe autumn of 1948, some fairly detailed figures were given to illustrate the strategy and rate of progress called for to achieve economic independence by the middle of 1952.      the required increase in manufacturing output after four years was set as an increase of about  one-quarter above 1947:    in factduring 1949,  the second year, an increase of one-fifth hadalready been achieved and all the principal industries had made good progress towards the objectives set.      The expansion programme for agriculture, launched in 1947, was designed toraise agricultural output by 1951-52 to about 20 per cent above1946-47-      Preliminary estimates suggest that in 1949-50 thelevel of agricultural output reached will be 1&apos;0-g- per cent over1946-47.      The growth in industrial production during 1949- substantially exceeded the forecast made early that year inthe Economic Survey.      That forecast was based on the expecta-tion of a rise of 4 per cent:    the actual achievement one of6-g- per cent.      Exports, according to the Long Term Programme,should by the middle of 1952 amount to 150 per cent of&quot;the 1938volume:    this figure was actually reached at the beginning of1949 and again after devaluation  (January,  1950).      But the target will now need to be increased sensibly in the light ofthe change in the terms of trade brought about by devaluation.Thus, though we still face major post-war problems, we do so with a record of practical achievement behind us and of realhope&apos;ahead.The fundamental strength of the economy is, as thesefigures show, much greater than it was in 1947*      Our main problem is still the balance of payments but devaluation givesus opportunities which we must seise.      The foregoing Surveyshows that there is now a real possibility of achieving ageneral balance of overseas payments and making good progress towards closing the dollar gap, given the maintenance of world,trade and the completion of the European Recovery Programme as originally planned.      Some increase in dollar earnings:improved sales to other hard currency countries:    the earningof gold from South Africa:    larger receipts from shipping:substantial reductions in expenditure on a range of dollarcommodities and their replacement from sterling and other sources - these are attainable aims for 1950.      Our progresssince September shows this, though part of it,  of course,  isthe result of temporary factors.Pone the less there still remains a formidable taskto be accomplished.      The primary aim of the Long Term Pro-gramme will not have been attained until we are fully self-supporting in our economy.      Three features in the situationmust be emphasised.      First that, while we must  continue to look to the rest of the Sterling Area to earn and. save all thedollars they can, the main hope of progress must rest with, the competitive power of the industry and commerce of the UnitedKingdom - its  ability to earn dollars in North America and toreplace dollar commodities and services in the rest of the

world.      Second, that this competitive power rests todaylargely upon the price advantage resulting from the present rates of exchange and will be diminished with every rise inthe United Kingdom price level.      And third that we mustprevent the home market drawing to itself the production require for the additional exports.Devaluation itself produces some price increase.The import price index is 12 per cent higher than it was sixmonths ago - the general wholesale index 6 per cent higher.These increases must be offset by improved industrial and commercial efficiency.      Failing that they must at least be prevented from multiplying themselves and further handicappingour exports, by leading to successful claims for increasedpersonal incomes, unrelated to higher production, which leadin turn to still higher prices, and so on.Of the three main claims upon national resourcestwo - the investment programme and expenditure on goods and services by the State and other public authorities - account for just over one-third, which they share about equally betweenthem:    personal consumption accounts for the remaining two-thirds.     At a given level of national income the nation cannot afford, an increase in any one of these three sectors unless itis prepared to make a corresponding reduction in the other two combined.      Thus a 10 per cent rise in consumption wouldrequire to offset it a 20 per cent cut in investment and public expenditure, or a 1+0 per cent cut in public expenditure alone.These figures illustrate how rapidly and surely theinternal balance of the economy would be upset by successfulpressure for increases in personal incomes,  always exceptingthose which are directly related to improvements&apos;&apos;in productivity and increases in output.      A rise of  200 million in national income is anticipated in 1950;    expenditure may rise to that extent without ill effect,  and personal -spending will have its share.      But if a greater share is claimed, through increaseddividends, salaries,  or wages, unrelated to increased output,the inevitable result will be a dangerous increase in pressure on the price level, and a handicap upon exporters that may welldefeat the efforts expected of them.The Government,  therefore, regard it as  of vitalimportance that we should continue the major economic andfinancial policies by which we have been guided over the last three years.      Reasonable restraint  in our personal claimsupon production,  increased efficiency and lower costs in.industry, the elimination of all waste in the private andpublic sectors of our economy alike are the necessary pricewith which to attain the economic independence and improvedstandards of living that are our objectives.
