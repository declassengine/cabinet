(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT)secret . P. (50)  35 COPY NO.J5TH MARCH,   1950GAB I NETBUDGET policy note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith, for consideration &quot;by-ray colleagues at our meeting on Friday,  17th March,a memorandum prepared, in the Treasury on the general question whether the Budget should aim at a largesurplus;R a   S a   G iTreasury Chambers,  S. W. 1,15TH MARCH,  1950.

It has been suggested that there is no convincingreason why the Budget should aim at a large surplus, andthat it would be possible to reduce taxation by returning tothe pre-war practice of balancing &quot;above-the-line&quot; or current expenditure from taxes, and borrowing for &quot;below-the-line&quot;or capital expenditure.2. The present practice was initiated by the thenChancellor of the Exchequer in the supplementary Budget ofNovember, 19U-7, and has been continued in the last twoBudgets.      As set out in the last two Budget speeches, theobject is.to maintain a high level of employment but toavoid the pressure of inflation.3. Before the war it was not considered to be the duty,of the Government to maintain the level of employment.Inflation was avoided largely by means of credit policy.A high rate of interest checked investment and led todeflation and unemployment.      But the economic picture was generally a succession of booms and slumps, which few coun-tries managed to avoid, though Sweden adopted a policyrather like the one we are now following.h. The objections to unemplojonent obvious.      Theobjections to inflation are also well-known.      Constantlyrising prices mean that the wage-earner is always behind,while those with pensions, fixed incomes and small savingssuffer a great deal.      The main benefit nearly always goesto profits.      In a country like Great Britain,  dependent onforeign trade, inflation also means that our prices get too high for our customers abroad.      Inflation leads inevitablyto the loss of reserves and eventually to successive currencydevaluations.      The tremendous social upheavals which followedsevere inflations  on the Continent are well-known.5. &apos; It is not going too far to say that it is the first duty of a Government which believes in planning to keep away from inflation and from deflation.      But v/e should never beable to do this without making use of the Budget as an instrument of control.6.   - The Budget is used as a means of economic planning in the following way.      If it appears desirable-to expand thelevel of monetary demand, because there are signs of a slump,then in comparison with the previous year it is desirable tomove in the direction of increased expenditure or reducedtaxation.      This does not necessarily mean a budget deficit.It may mean that, but it may also mean having less of a budgetsurplus,  or it might mean a larger budget deficit.      Converselyif inflationary pressure is too strong, then steps must betaken to reduce monetary demand, and this can be done.byspending less and taxing more.7. It will be generally agreed that, while we havemanaged so far to keep inflation in check, there are certainlyno signs of deflation,  and that on the contrary there arestill signs, of inflationary pressure in our economy.      Theevidence of this is to be found in the continuing very low level of unemployment,  the. tendency of prices to&apos;rise, thehigh level of&apos; profits and the upward pressure on wages.      Thedifficulties which, we are meeting in expanding our exports to north America, in spite of the very high priority &quot;which we attach to this, are also partly due to the strong- pull of thehome market.

8. Accordingly, if now we were to change our policyand content ourselves with a balance or a small surplus onlyon current Government transactions, or what is called &quot;above-the-line&quot; items, we should certainly be releasing very power-ful inflationary pressure on our economy.9. We could describe the present situation&apos; in another way by saying that the size of the investment programme iscertainly in excess of the level of voluntary savings.      Ifthe Government did nothing to close this gap, total expendi-ture would increase and would exceed the current value ofgoods available for consumption, and the pull of the home market would increase and prices would tend to rise.10. Thus Government policy has had to be to removethrough taxation the estimated difference between what people would otherwise spend and what is available for them to buy:to avoid the situation of &quot;too much money chasing too fewgoods&quot;.      This is the same as saying that the Government haveto provide the difference between the needs of the investment programme and the amount of voluntary saving.      In fact theGovernment have to make up by their policy the deficiency in private saving.11. We have been very much helped in the past by UnitedStates and Canadian loans and gifts, which have allowed us tobring in goods for which we did not have to pay by exports.This made more available to buy at home and thus reduced the pressure of monetary demand.      The need to become independentagain has compelled us to expand our exports and reach a balance as quickly as possible.      At present we have almostachieved this and we have been able to meet the calls made onus by the releases from sterling balances which we considered essential to our policies.      With Marshall Aid decliningrapidly, as it must do from now on, we must strengthen our external position.      We can stave off inflation at home aslong as we can meet our difficulties by borrowing from abroad,but it is certain to come upon us with full force again assoon as loans (or gifts)  come to an end, unless we take propersteps to prepare for the  situation.12. It happens that in the fiscal year just ending, theamount of the Budget surplus &quot;above-the-line&quot;  is very close tothe amount required for investment by Government departments and local -authorities,      So that the Budget will be roughly in&quot;overall balance&quot;.      But this result is an incidental feature of our policy.      If the local authority borrowing was less,but the total of investment was  still the same, we should still need a surplus to make up the shortage of saving.      Inthe same way,  if we had to deal with a slump, we should judge the situation by the general deficiency of demand.  -13. Several suggestions have been made about the right7ness or otherwise of&quot;this policy.      First,  it has been saidthat the calculation of what is needed is very speculative.This is certainly true.      But we have now had several years&apos;   -experience of calculations of this kind,  and we have so farkept inflation in check, thus permitting our exports to riseto the level needed to balance o\ir overseas accounts:    yetat the same time we have avoided deflation and so kept up thelevel of employment.      If the calculations had been far out,the errors -would have shown themselves by now,  on one side orthe other.      Indeed it is the success of these very policiesthat we relied upon so much in the recent Election.-2-

14. Secondly, It is suggested that because the Govern-ment are not directly responsible for most of the investment programme, they ought not to concern themselves with theprovision of finance through having large budget surpluses.But the investment programme will be carried through even ifthe^e is no surplus,  and. in fact we  are more likely to haveinvestment when there is inflationary pressure than in other conditions, since it is the excess of demand which makes new investment seem so profitable.      If just as much is spent on investment as before, but budget policy allows larger sumsthan before to be spent on consumption, the consequence mustbe inflation.15. Finally,  it is suggested that if we reduced taxes,people would save the amounts of the reductions and thiswould play the same part as the Budget surplus would havedone.      It is quite true that saving by individuals is just asgood as,  and much more popular than, saving through the Budget.But it is very unlikely that the kind of tax reductions which  /ould be socially desirable would be accompanied by equivalentamounts of saving.      It is difficult to save at all from lowincomes and almost impossible to save 100% of any increase.If we reduced the top level of super-tax, the very rich would-probably give up an equivalent amount of their current expenditure out of past saving.     But this kind of taxreduction would be against the policy of re-distributingincome.16.&apos; To sum up therefore:-(1)    The policy of planning requires the Government tomaintain employment but to avoid inflation.(2)    If we gave way to inflation, we should lose our export position and give up the hope of financial independence.(3)    The tendency to inflation is due to the high levelof investment, which is  socially necessary but which is financed out of past savings.      Currentsavings are not enough to meet our investmentneeds, partly because of the high taxes necessaryin any case to meet high Government expenditure.(U)    We could only avoid this by reducing the current level of investment.(3)    If we reduced taxes, we would get some saving asa result.      But there would not be enough to make up the difference.      The dangers of our externalposition are such that we could not afford totake such a risk.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1 ,13TH MARCH,  1930.
