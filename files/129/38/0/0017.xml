a I! s D0CUMBNT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTAGRICULTURAL PRICES AND FEEDINGSTUFFS RATIONINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agricultureand fisheries. In accordance with previous practice we propose that the statutoryannual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry, as required by Section 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, shall be held as usual in the month of February. The review this year will be particularly difficult,primarily because of the substantial increases in costs confronting farmers, ofwhich the larger part arises from the Governments decision to eliminate theremaining part of the subsidy on animal feedingstuffs. We have thought itdesirable, therefore, to consult our colleagues on the main questions of policy involved before giving general instructions to our negotiators.2. The matters which will need to be decided by Ministers, in the light ofthe Review, are :  (a) actual prices of milk, fatstock and eggs in the year ending 31st March,1951; .(b) actual prices of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and sugar-beet of the 1951harvest;(c) minimum guaranteed prices for milk, fatstock and eggs over the twoyears ending 31st March, 1954.3. The subjects for discussion with the Farmers&apos; Unions, relating to &quot;thegeneral economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry &quot; are determined partly by precedent and partly by statements which we have made onbehalf of the Government at various times.  These subjects are : (i) agricultural production targets for the periods covered by the prices to be announced;(ii) farmers&apos; aggregate net income, and for comparison those of others ofthe rural community;(iii) distribution of farm incomes by size and type of farm;(iv) estimate of farmers&apos; capital expenditure;(v) estimate of aggregate cost changes;(vi) cost changes by individual commodities;(vii) relative prices of comparable home-produced and imported products.Of these the first, second and fifth are by far the most important and therest of this memorandum is chiefly concerned with the issues arising underthese heads:-Printed for the Cabinet.

Production Targets4. On 5th January, 1949, we circulated to our colleagues on the economic policy Committee (E.P.C. (50) 7) a report of the Agricultural Output Committee(which includes officials of the Agriculture Departments, Treasury, Ministry 0fFood, Central Economic Planning Staff and Economic Section of the cabinet secretariat) reviewing the progress of the Agricultural Expansion programme in this report attention was called to certain possible modifications of theagricultural targets which had a bearing not only on the impending Februaryreview but also on import programmes and the general shape of agricultural production policy. Decisions are outstanding on a number of points and are needed before the Review begins, since without firm production targets it will notbe possible to determine whether prices are more or less than are needed to callforth the desired quantities of output.5. Wheat. The published target for 1951 is 2,750,000 acres, but probableperformance is 2,500,000 acres. The Agricultural Output committee recommended that the published target should be maintained but that no majorprice incentive should be applied to reach it. The Economic Planning Board,however, recommended that the target should be reduced to a more realisticfigure. We are disposed to agree with this latter view, and suggest that the target should be reduced to 2,500,000 acres. The volume of wheat production would not be correspondingly smaller, partly because yields per acre are in generaltending to rise, and partly because the acreage that would not be sown would,if it were sown, be on poorer land. Acceptance of 2,500,000 acres as the figure for 1951 will probably imply that the existing price differential in favour ofwheat compared with coarse grains should be maintained but not increased.6.   Barley, Oats, Sugar-beet. The 1951 targets are not in question.7. Potatoes. The Agricultural Output Committee recommended, and theEconomic Planning Board concurred, that the 1950 target should be reduced from1,300,000 acres to 1,250,000. acres. This should allow of some reduction to bemade in growers&apos; gross returns, without diminishing net returns, and also some reduction in administrative costs. There would also be a smaller loss to theExchequer on surplus potatoes if the yield were high. On the other hand, thechange in target would increase the risk of potatoes being somewhat short of demand if the yield were light.8.   Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Eggs. There are no points for decision at this stage.9. Milk. Output in the current agricultural statistical year (June 1949to May 1950) now seems likely to reach 1,965 million gallons compared with the published target of 1,920 million gallons in 1952-53. The Agricultural OutputCommittee have already recommended that this latter be increased to a more realistic figure of 1,965 million gallons. There is now no need to stimulate milk production by price incentives as in former years. Indeed some restraint on milk production is implied, with a consequent transfer of emphasis to meat.10. Our colleagues have already decided on two powerful restraints. one is the impending large rise in feeding-stuffs prices, which will bear hardly onwinter milk production, and the other is the policy of tightening up sanitarystandards of milk production. Whether or not there is any need for further measures of restraint will be discussed at the Review.11. For those commodities for which we have suggested that no immediatedecisions are required, we recommend that the existing published targets, whichhave not been seriously questioned, should still hold good.12. In that case the broad objectives of the Agricultural Expansion Pro-gramme would remain unchanged. The volume of net output is planned by 1952-5^to reach nearly 50 per cent, more than pre-war, and farmers are to be urged and assisted to reach this objective in the national interest A special propagandadrive has already been started to facilitate the attainment of the crop objectives.A ggregate Income, Costs, and Capital Outlay and inferences therefrom13. The following figures, calculated by methods agreed with the central statistical Office, show the yearly changes in aggregate net income of farmed
for allfarmproducts.* The figures for 1949-50 are still; provisional but are asfinal as they can be made for some months.Actual or Aggregate net incomeforecasted adjusted to normalJune-May years               aggregate yield and weathernet income conditions  million   million19^3-44 (peak war year)      ...         237 235f1946-47  ............         1831 204*1947-48  ............         217 22541948-49  ............         2844 269*1949-50  .............         281 211\14.

The cost increases confronting farmers on a full year basis are now estimated to&quot; be rather less than those given in E.P.C.

(Although not strictly relevant to a consideration of farmers&apos; incomes,it should not be overlooked that the elimination of the subsidies on feedingstuffswill involve domestic pig and poultry producers in extra costs estimated to amountto  1 - 6 million, for which of course there can be no question of recoupment. It&apos;s to be expected that there will be vociferous protests from these one and three-quarter million domestic producers.)17.   The outstanding points in the above tables are that farmers&apos;&quot; incomesa normal yield basis have continued to rise; that farmers are continuing to* The aggregate net income figures given in this and the succeeding paragraphs relate to allfarm production including that part consumed in farmers&apos; own households. That is, they include&quot;icotne derived from products (of which the most important are fruit and vegetables) for which therejjre no guaranteed markets and prices, and for which, therefore, no question of price recoupment by government action for increased costs can arise. These figures give a valuable indication of the trend of total farm incomes, but they are only in part (75 per cent.) relevant to the price-fixingPurposes of the February Review.   See paragraphs 16 and 23.t Rough estimate.t Increases operating in a full year, mainly 1950-51.S The elimination of feedingstuffs subsidies is to operate from the beginning of the financialyear 1950-51. According to existing procedure, however, farmers are only entitled to claim costrecoupment for the extra costs per unit applied to the rather smaller quantities of feedinestuffs usedto 1949-50.38237 b 2
plough back in capital outlay a substantial part of that income well above the 40 million per annum injected in 1947-48 and subsequent years; and that thecost increases confronting them are very substantial indeed.18. We have no doubt that the chief and indeed preponderating explana-tion of the rise in net incomes over the last year or two is efficiency. We drew attention to this development in efficiency at this time last year (P.C. (49) 14\when it was particularly striking, and since then the trend seems to have con-tinued. Between 1948-49 and 1949-50 farm incomes should on the basis of decisions taken in February 1949, have fallen by  6-7 million, but actually seeralikely to have risen by  8 million. More direct evidence of efficiency comes fromthe increase in livestock output without a proportionate increase in labour andfeedingstuffs the total labour force has indeed declined. The same is probablytrue of wheat and some other (but not all) crops. In milk the development of efficiency has been especially outstanding.19. We have now to decide how big a reduction of net incomes is to apply in 1950^-51 and on what grounds, and suggest the following :       ;20. The aggregate net income in 1946-47 at normal yields was  204^- million,This was associated at the time with a declining output and was consideredinsufficient, but for the present purposes can be taken as a basis. Since 1948-47the volume of net output has been rising. The actual increase between that yearand 1949-50 is estimated at 12 per cent., but some part of this increase is attributable to the fact that we were starting from a year in which weather conditions were adverse. Making an arbitrary but generous allowance of 4 percent, for abnormally bad weather in the initial year, the increase in the net output at normal yields in the ensuing three years can be conservatively put at8 per cent. It is reasonable and desirable to allow farmers some reward for the extra capital outlay, risks and effort required to produce this increased output.This is consistent with the principles of the White Paper on Personal Incomes,Costs and Prices, which explicitly recognises increased productivity as a reasonwhich would justify an increase in personal incomes. Taking account of this factor, the base income to-day corresponding to  204J million in 1946-47 wouldbe  221 million.21. To this should be added the  40 million which the Government under-took in 1947 to inject annually into farmers&apos; incomes for five years for the purposeof capital investment. (It should be noted that actual capital outlay by farmershas continued well above this figure see paragraph 15 above). This would thengive  261 million as the target in comparison with the estimated 1949-501 income of  2771 million.22. The effect of the adoption of  261 million as the target income for1950-51 would mean that the increases in costs would be roughly shared equally between the farmer and consumer or Exchequer. We should, however, pointout that if a net income of  261 million is aimed at it will not necessarily beachieved in 1950-51. The decisions resulting from the review will not all operate in 1950-51, but will still be producing effects in 1951-52 or later.23. The effects on farm prices for review products of a decision anchoredto  261 million of aggregate net income would be as follows : Forecast incomes for 1949-50 Target income   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...	  million 277% 261Proposed reduction in income (all products) Proposed reduction in income (review products only)(1) Add cost increases being incurred in 1949-50Q   ......	16i \2\ 8Cost increases in full year (review products only)......	20J 38 To be recouped by price increases for review products   ...	18Notes. 0) This calculation assumes that the income reduction of  16  million is shared betweenreview products and non-review products respectively in the proportions to the gross incomes of thesetwo groups. This treatment implies that the non-review products will suffer a reduction in net income of  4 million because the prevailing market conditions are such that they are unlikely to succeed in gaining recompense for the full increase in costs of  8 million.(2) Some of the cost increases mentioned in paragraph 15 have already taken effect or will take effect before the end of the current farm year (31st May, 1950). In calculating the net farm income for 1949-50 no allowance has been made for any price recoupment. Hence the  8 million involvedrepresents an addition to the proposed reduction in farm income on review products of  121 mill&apos;011in 1950-51.
24. This basis implies that farmers will have to bear no less than  20^million (53 per cent.) of total cost increases for review commodities of  38^ millionjn a full year. In addition they have lost (since 31st December, 1949) ploughing(mate of about  5 million, adjustment on potato acreage payments and othereconomies in the Estimates of the Agriculture Departments which might amountto a further  2 million. The Farmers&apos; Unions will no doubt argue that for thepurposes of price recoupment these items should be regarded as in the samecategory as cost increases.25. Last year when we proposed a reduction in farm incomes before the review had begun, we urged &quot; that the reduction should not be such as to lessen the high degree of (farmers&apos;) confidence in the Governments aims . . . , to prejudice the achievement of the agricultural expansion programme or . . . to discourage further endeavour on the part of farmers to make the most efficient use of all their resources.&quot;26. If these remarks were pertinent to under-recoupment of higher coststo the extent of  10 million, they are all the more pertinent to the still greaterunder-recoupment of  20-^ million now proposed. It is important, therefore, thatour negotiators should be authorised to discuss the practicability of measures,such as the following, which would mitigate the effects on food production : (i) Fertiliser subsidy a continuance of that part of the subsidy which is directly related to grassland and marginal land development (seeE.P.C. (50) 2nd Meeting, Minute 2) on such terms that a correspondingdiminution is made to the increase in farmers&apos; prices,(ii) Marginal Land. While a substantial reduction in net incomes may hejustified in relation to farming as a whole it would have a depressing effect on the marginal areas, and some offset in these areas in the formof a subsidised scheme of development would be required. Thedevelopment of these marginal areas offers the main source of increasednumbers of beef cattle and sheep on which a larger supply of home produced meat mainly depends.27. Fertilisers. The Economic Policy Committee at their meeting on 9th January (E.P.C. (50) 2nd Meeting, Minute 2) agreed to consider further thequestion of fertiliser subsidies and implied that a compromise proposal by our-selves would be received sympathetically. In the light of the discussions at theEconomic Planning Board and the Economic Policy Committee we have, there-fore, given preliminary consideration to various possible means of mitigating theeffects of the existing decision.28. The means we favour would be to grant subsidies on a selective basis for the development of grassland and marginal land. In England and Walesthis could, on the grassland side, take the form of a subsidy of one-third of farmers&apos; expenditure on nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers for grasslanddevelopment. In Scotland the choice of fertilisers would be somewhat different,hut again it would be grassland and marginal land which would qualify for therebate. The cost in the United Kingdom would be of the order of  5 million.Such a scheme would be relatively expensive and difficult to administer equitablythroughout the country, but we cannot think of any other which would accord with the principle of selectivity suggested by the Economic Planning Board.While in respect of grassland such a scheme would be based primarily upon theDeed to develop the grass, it would not necessarily require that the subsidisedfertilisers should be applied only to those fields actually under grass in any oneyear, since there may be other stages in a rotation involving grass at which the fertiliser should preferably be applied.We should be glad of authority to negotiate with the farmers on these lines.Further Reference to Ministers29. Provisional arrangements have been made to start discussions between officials and the farmers on 13th February, and by the end of February they willhave reached a stage (without committing Ministers) at which it would be^Ppropriate to report the results to a Ministerial Committee. A provisionalbasis for agreement may not have been reached with the farmers, but the issuesshould have been clarified.   In the latter event we (or our successors) would
presumably approach the Production Committee for further decisions, in pve.paration for a further and concluding round of discussions with the farmersbut it might in the circumstances be necessary to consult only the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and Minister of Food. We seek authority to proceed along theselines, starting negotiations with the farmers on or about 13th February an(]reporting progress shortly after the Election.Part II. Derationing of Feedingstuffs30. The Agricultural Output Committee have considered whether it wouldbe desirable and practicable to discontinue the rationing of animal feedingstuffswhen the Exchequer subsidy is eliminated next April. There are indications thatsome farmers are taking up a smaller proportion of their total ration, entitlementthan hitherto, and this tendency may well be accentuated with the rise in feeding-stuffs prices that will follow the elimination of the subsidy. The AgriculturalOutput Committee recommend, however, and we agree, that on the present supply situation, immediate derationing would involve too big a risk of further sub-stantial price rises and of upsetting the balance of our agricultural productionamong different commodities.31. We recommend instead that steps should be taken to distribute theunused surplus of feedingstuffs referred to above as arising out of a tendency of some farmers not to buy up to their individual entitlements.. The best methodseems to us to alter the scales of coupon issues so as to increase the entitlementsof some of those classes of farmers who would at present buy more if allowed.We should increase these entitlements progressively, starting with an increaseof entitlements to pig rations by, say, 500,000 tons a year. From experience ofthe proportion of these extra entitlements actually taken up, we could then assess the safety of derationing at a later date.32. In operating this proposal it would be necessary to pay continuous,regard to the volume of supplies from overseas and the means of paying for them.The proposal would, however, put less potential strain on the import programmethan derationing would do.Part III. Summary33. To summarise the points on which decisions are now required, we askour colleagues to agree (a) With regard to production targets, that (i) the 1951 target for wheat be reduced to 2,500,000 acres;(ii) the 1950 target for potatoes be reuuced to 1,250,000 acres;(iii) the 1952-53 target for milk be increased to 1,965 million gallons;(&amp;) with regard to the Price Review, that our negotiators be authorised toenter into discussions with representatives of the National FarmersUnions on the following basis (it being understood that the position ofMinisters is reserved) (i) the target income to be kept in mind should be  261 million;(ii) of the cost increases in a full year of  38-^ million, it should becontemplated that the farmers might receive recoupment oi 18 millions and no recoupment for the remaining  20^million;(iii) the practicability of a subsidy (which would be set against the 18 million to be recouped) for the development of grass-land and marginal land should be explored during the negotiations;(c) that consideration of de-rationing of animal feedingstuffs be deferred,but that steps be taken to distribute the present unused surplus.J.
