2(^printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950CONFIDENTIAI Copy No.    32CP. (SO) ,4020th March, 1950CABINETCOUNCIL OF  EUROPE : RELATIONS  BETWEEN  COMMITTEE  OFMINISTERS AND CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRelations between the two organs of the Council of Europe have never been satisfactory. The basic reason for this is probably that the majority of themembers of the Consultative Assembly are enthusiasts for various forms ofEuropean political union. The&apos;Assembly as a whole is predisposed in favour ofsuch schemes to an extent which altogether invalidates its. claim to representEuropean public opinion in general. The Committee of Ministers, as therepresentatives of the independent sovereign states which set up the Council, are constantly forced to remind the Assembly that it is not, and cannot in the fore-seeable future expect to become, the European Parliament that it would like to be.In these circumstances, conflict is inevitable. It is therefore arguable that theproblem is fundamentally insoluble, and that any suggestions that are made canonly palliate the evil without remedying it. Even if this should be so, however,palliation is clearly important.2. Various proposals have been advanced to remedy the present situation.The Secretary-General of the Council, M. Paris, has put forward a plan whichbears a general resemblance to the schemes advocated by the European Movement.This involves transforming the Standing Committee of the Consultative Assemblyinto a &quot; Supra-National Executive Authority.&quot; This new Executive authority would be &quot; elected under a system to be established by both the Assembly and theCommittee of Ministers.&quot; Its numbers might be limited for the present to 11.It would &quot;prepare the work of the Assembly&quot; and see that the latter&apos;s&quot; decisions &quot; were followed up. It would &quot; correspond directly &quot;with the Gov-ernments of Member States and the Secretary-General and his staff would be&quot; under its authority.&quot; It would meet for one week in each month and its decisions would be taken by a simple majority vote. Finally, it would &quot; decide asto whether a proposal brought before; the Assembly would .... possess the force oflaw applicable by Member States or whether it should be regarded as a covenant tobe signed between them, or as a recommendation.&quot; Decisions on such points as thiswould be taken by a two-thirds majority. The only function of the Committee ofMinisters would apparently be to accept or rej ect proposals put up to them bythe Standing Committee after having obtained the approval of the Assembly; theall-important method whereby the Committee of Ministers would vote on this issue is unfortunately so obscure as to be unintelligible.3. It seems quite clear that M. Paris&apos;s plan is not only impracticable butquite unacceptable. In the first place it links the question of improved relationsbetween Ministers and Assembly with that of a European political authority,by attempting to impose on Western Europe a kind of &quot; Executive Authority &quot;in the establishment of which the electorates in the various countries would havehad no say whatever. It thus seems probable that the Committee of ministers would be quite unable to exercise their theoretical veto in view of the pressure to which they would be subject.38446
4. In any observations which it is thought desirable to make on M. Paris&apos;splan, it will, of course, be necessary to state also what constructive counter-proposals should be made, in order to improve relations between the consultative assembly and the Committee of Ministers.5. In the course of correspondence on this subject with the Foreign office the Lord President and his staff have put forward certain suggestions. Theseare briefly : (i) that informal as well as formal contacts between the Ministers and theAssembly might be strengthened; and(ii) that there would be less likelihood of serious divergences between theCommittee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly if we wereto continue the practice of including Ministers among our representa-tives to the latter, and if other countries were to follow our example.While there is force in both these suggestions; it must be pointed out that, in viewof the short duration of meetings, opportunities for informal contacts between ministers and the Assembly are few and fleeting and cannot be compared withthe opportunities that exist, for example, in the House of Commons. As regardsformal contacts, it is true that the Statute of the Council of Europe makes pro-vision for the Committee of Ministers to be represented by one of their number in the Assembly. This provision has not hitherto been invoked, probably becausethe Committee is not a collectively responsible Cabinet and because it has, inpractice, proved impossible for the Committee to choose a Minister who would speak for them, as he might for a national Government. As regards the inclusionof Ministers in national delegations, I consider that the Assembly is, and should remain, a consultative organ which cannot in any way engage the responsibilityof Governments. With Ministers in the Assembly, there must always be a doubt whether they are speaking as individuals or as representatives of the Governmentto which they belong.6. However, I. am still conscious of the desirability of recommending someconstructive step in the direction of creating informal contacts between theMinisters and the Assembly; and it has been suggested to me that there mightbe something to be said for the following scheme. The Committee of Ministersis meeting on 30th and 31st March. The Standing Committee is holding its firstmeeting on the afternoon of 31st March. It might be possible to profit by thiscircumstance so as to arrange for some informal contacts between the Ministers(or some of them) and the Standing Committee (or some of them). Clearly ajoint meeting would be out of the question if only in view of the unwieldy size(twenty-six members) of the Standing Committee. But it might not be out ofthe question for the Ministers, having cast their decisions into the form of aletter to the Chairman of the Standing Committee in accordance with the pro-cedure adopted at the last Committee of Ministers, to have some quite informal discussion with some representatives of the Standing Committee, to be selected by that Committee, in order to discuss the Ministers&apos; decisions. It might also bepossible, during such informal talks, to arrange, in principle, for further informal discussions regarding the work of the Council of Europe as a whole to take place during the year between political representatives of the Ministers and certainrepresentatives of the Assembly. Clearly there could be no question of voting at such meetings nor could there be any question of taking decisions, but such a systemof informal gatherings might still provide the additional liaison which is undoubtedly required and which unfortunately cannot be provided by the secretariat. In any case, if such a system showed signs of developing in undesir-able directions, it could quite easily be abandoned. There are certainly dangersin the scheme in that the Assembly may seek to profit by such contacts to increase their own importance unduly; but on the other hand there are equal, if notgreater, dangers in doing nothing and in allowing the present unsatisfactorysituation to get even worse.7, The &apos;&apos; Paris Plan&apos;&apos; has been communicated to the Brussels treaty powers, who are expected to give their comments on it in writing to the secretariat-General of the Council of Europe. It has been agreed in thePermanent Commission of the Brussels Treaty that it would be desirable ifpossible for the Brussels Treaty Powrers to take a common line when the problem is discussed in the Committee of Ministers.
8. The next meeting of the Committee of Ministers is on 30th March andthe question of the relations between the Committee of Ministers and the assembly is on the agenda. The Permanent Commission of the Brussels Treaty is holding special meeting on 24th March to discuss the problem. Our views should, ifpossible, be notified to the Commission before their meeting.recommendations. If my colleagues agree: with the views expressed in this memorandum I should like authority to instruct the United Kingdom representative on thePermanent Commission-(i) to secure the agreement of his colleagues to the view that the plan putforward by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and setout in paragraph 2 above is both impractical and unacceptable; and(ii) to suggest to his colleagues that the Governments which they representshould all agree together with ourselves to put forward the proposalreferred to in paragraph 6 above at the forthcoming meeting of theCommittee of Ministers.10. If agreement is reached in the Permanent Commission I furtherrecommend that the next step should be to sound the Secretary-General of theCouncil of Europe and the President of the Consultative Assembly (M. Spaak).E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th March, 1950.
