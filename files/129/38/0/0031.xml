/secret^P. (50) 31. COPY NO.   1110TH MARCH,  1950CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE  (ENGLAND AND WALES):CONTROL OF expenditure memorandum by the Minister of Health1. At their meeting on 9th March (C. M. (50) 9th.Conclusions, Minute 1(2)), the Cabinet Invited me to submit amemorandum explaining the existing financial basis of theNational Health Service and the modifications which would haveto be made if the central Government were to be able toexercise closer control over the expenditure incurred on this service.      This paper deals only with England and Wales:there has been no time to consult the Secretary of State forScotland.2. The National Health Service falls into three fairlydistinct parts - the Hosxoital and Specialist Service, theGeneral Practitioner Services, and the Local Health authority services.      For convenience, each can be looked at separatelyand then the picture as a whole can be summarised at the end.Hospital and Specialist Service3. In expenditure this is,  as it must be, the biggestof the three parts.      Current net cost is about  209 millions(out of a total of about  318 millions).      Estimates for thecoming year indicate some  238 millions (out of a total of 351 millions).4. The Minister is directly responsible by statute forthis service.      He administers it through the agency of regional hospital Boards, voluntary and unpaid bodies appointed by him and responsible for the wider general aspects of the serviceover large areas;    and those Boards in turn use the agency oflocal Management Committees, voluntary and unpaid bodiesappointed by the Boards, for the ordinary local running of the hospitals.      Teaching Hospitals are separately run by specialBoards of Governors, voluntary and unpaid bodies appointed bythe Minister, but with a proportion of directly nominated members.5. This delegation of responsibility to voluntary bodieswas always featured, in Parliament and generally, as one of the basic principles of the scheme, and as the preventive of an over-bureaucratised service.      The alternative would have been to give the whole Job to local government, with exchequer grants, but the present local government  structure would havebeen quite unsuitable;    if radical reform of it is ever under-taken, the position should perhaps be considered anew.      As itis,  control of expenditure  rests on the following devices.6. First,  and as the main control, local management committees have to formulate annual estimates, or budgets, oftheir total requirements for each year;    and those, with therequirements of the Regional Boards, have so far had to be put up for the Minister&apos;s examination and approval.      (Boards of

Governors of Teaching Hospitals put theirs up separately, butsimilarly.)      It has now become clear, however, that theMinistry cannot possibly scrutinise,  in enough detail, theestimates of 377 separate Management Committees;    all that hasbeen possible has been to make a broad comparison of oneRegion with another.      This is not good enough.      Therefore,it has now been decided that in future the Committees&apos; budgetswill be dealt with in detail by the Regional Boards, while theMinister will deal with regional totals.      This should secure a much more effective examination.7. Secondly, the validity of a budget cannot be assessedUnless there is some more reliable guide to proper standardsthan has been available under the infinitely varied forms ofrecords and accounts inherited by the Minister in all thevarious hospitals taken over.      This means better &quot;costing&quot;.Too much magic can easily be attributed to detailed hospitalcosting;    in practice, really detailed costing - with, checksand records of every minute transaction - is not practicable in the operation of a hospital, as it may be in a factory.But  some broad,  simpler and more uniform costing system iscertainly wanted.      A working party of selected hospitalofficers has Just produced proposals for this;    the;/ seempromising and are therefore being adopted for the future.      Inaddition, and for the longer term, experimentc  in more detailare about to be carried, out in selected hospitals,  on therecommendation of the Central Health Services Council.      all of this will facilitate a better accuracy in judging the validity of budgets.8. Another control lies in the regulation by the Ministerof the scales of remuneration of hospital staff of all kinds.Whit ley machinery now exists for negotiation of this in almost all fields, and scales of pay are therefore practically allgoverned from the centre and not left to local discretion.      Upto now, however, this governs scales but not numbers ** orestablishments.      This &quot;is a defect.      To prescribe establishments in general,  even for particular classes and kinds of hospitals,is impracticable  (local needs are affected by the shape of a building, size of wards, number of storeys, etc. ).      The only way is to settle an establishment ad hoc for each hospital.This could be done by a small visiting body of experts(probably including some from the Organisation and MethodsDivision of the Treasury) which could go to the hospital andsettle a general establishment for it,  after which the hospitalwould hove to seek approval for any excess of that fixed estab-lishment.      Done as a continuous process,  starting with thepriraa facie worst cases, this could steadily extend over thewhole field.      New and. better forms of staff returns,  resultingfrom the working party of selected hospital officers, referredto in paragraph 7, will now enable the&quot; orima facie worst cases to be pin-pointed.       It is proposed, therefore, that this process of fixing individual establishments should start as soonas possible.9. Economies can sometimes be effected through the centralnegotiation of bulk-buying contracts for some kinds of hospitalsupplies.      This is already applied to some of the most expen-sive items,   such as X-ray apparatus, and the merits of furtherextensions of central supply are being explored.&quot;10. The Central Health Services Council has a specialcommittee to consider the administrative structure of&quot;thehospital service,  and that committee&apos;s report is expected in thenear future.      In addition,  I have oust appointed, a financialexpert,  Sir Cyril Jones, to bring a fresh mind to bear and toundertake a personal and independent examination of the wholefinancial administration of the health service.      I have askedfor his considered views within the next few months.      Withthese two enquiries afoot already,  I should doubt the value of

initiating any other special investigation Toy any new committee at the moment, but this ought to be considered again if theresults of these present enquiries prove unsatisfactory.11. On capital expenditure, of which there is relatively little at- the moment, ail the local bodies engaged in hospitaladministration already have to get Ministerial approval to any work of building: or civil engineering costing more than 10,000.      In addition they have to seek Ministerial authori-sation for any capital work of over  1,000 which is of a kind which falls - as most capital works do - under Part II of the sixth Schedule to the Defence  (General) Regulations.12. These are some of the measures in hand,  or to beput in hand, to improve the control of hospital expenditure.There arc, of course, more drastic possibilities.      the transformation of the treasurers or secretaries of localManagement Committees into come kind of &quot;protected&quot; officersof the Ministry has sometimes been suggested.      But this wouldbo a rather revolutionary change in the main principles andspirit of the original scheme, and if it is ever done it mustemerge naturally from the recommendations of some independent body or comrnitteo and not bo directly initiated by the centralGovernment - for it would provoke a lot of outcry aboutbureaucracy.13- Beyond all this,  the only substantial and effectivereduction in co;::ts would lie in basic changes of the serviceitself, such as the recovery of partial payments from patientsfor their &quot;hotel&quot; maintenance in hospital, or even of paymentstowards the cost of more expensive appliances supplied by the hospitals.      I am sure that such changes (which we have previously considered and rejected) would be open to heavy andlegitimate criticism, and that we certainly have not reachedthe time when they must be considered.      They would also havethe consequence that special provision would have to be made,through National Assistance, to meet all hardship cases,  and my colleagues are well aware of the immense amount of irritationand grievance which would accompany any such return Co the oldprinciples of the means test.14. Allowing for all sensible administrative measures toprevent waste, the plain fact is -chat the cost of the hospital service not only will, but ought to, increase.      Most of the hospitals fall far short of any proper standard;    accommodationneeds to be increased, particularly for tuberculosis and mentalhealth - indeed some of the mental hospitals are very near to apublic scandal and we are lucky that the:/ have not so farattracted more limelight and -publicity.      Throughout the servicethere are piling up arrears of essential capital work.      also it is in this field, particularly, that constant new develop-ments will always be needed to keep pace with research progress(as, recently,  in penicillin,  streptomycin,  cortisone, etc.)and to expand essential specialist services, such as hearing-aids or the hospital ophthalmic cervices.      The position cannotbe evaded that a nationally owned and administered hospital service will always involve a very considerable and expandingExchequer outlay.      If that position cannot, for financial reasons, be faced, then the only alternatives (to my mindthoroughly undesirable) are either to give up - in whole or inpart - the idea of a national responsibility for the hospitalsor else to import into the scheme come regular source of revenuesuch as the recovery of chargoa from those who use it.      I am afraid it is clear that we cannot have it both ways.

15- These, between them, account for a total expenditureof approximately  139 millions in the current year and are estimated at approximately  138 millions for next year.      Theycover the general medical, pharmaceutical, dental and opticalservices.16. Their expenditure lies, almost entirely in the paymentof the doctors,  chemists, dentists and opticians taking part in them and the coot of drugs and materials supplied by them.The Minister is responsible by statute and uses, for local administration, the agency of the 138 Executive Councils.These Councils have little say, however, in the kind ofexpenditure incurred, which is mainly governed by centralregulations about the payment of the various practitioners.With the exception of the doctors, the sise of the actual billin most of these services is very largely determined by the.amount of the public demand for,  and use of,  the facilities provided.      The problem of control is, therefore, one of organ-is at ion to see that their use is reasonable.17. The general feature of all these services at themoment is that, after a period of complete uncertainty as tothe extent of the demand for them and of bewildering fluctua-tions in that demand, in the opening phases, there seems to be good reason now to hope that the level of demand is steadyingand that the future is  reasonably predictable.      Demand isprobably steadying at rather too high a level,  and carefuladministration - with the various measures, about to be mentioned - should serve to lower it to some extent.      But theperiod of unexpected &quot;peaks&quot; is,  I hope, coming to an end.General Medical Practitioners18. General medical services at present cost some 41,745,000 and will probably cost some  42,734,000 next year.19. This service probably warrants no substantial altera-tion at the moment.      Adequate control of the bulk of theexpenditure is secured by the  system under which the doctorsundertake a collective responsibility in return for a fixed,&quot;pool&quot; of remuneration, which is then distributed among them --the share of each broadly depending on the size of his list of patients.      Whether the &quot;pool&quot; is adequate is a matter forperiodic argument with the doctors;    but,  as long as it is fixed, it automatically governs most of the annual bill.20. There is probably some  scope for economy - not  easy to achieve - in the reduction of -unnecessary certification of incapacity, entitling patients to sickness cash benefit.      Anysaving would be reflected in the Vote of the Ministry ofNotional Insurance, not that of the Health Service.      There isno single solution to lax certification, which must be atendency in any scheme whereby popularity with patientsincreases lists and therefore incomes.      The available checkscan be intensified however:    they are (a) an increase in thenumber of doubtful cases referred by the Ministry of national insurance to the medical officers of the Ministry of Health forchecking;    (b) an Increase in the contacts of these medical officers with doctors in areas where absenteeism seems tojustify special enquiry.      Steps on both these lines arealready being taken.

The Chemists and Prescriptions21. The cost of this service is now about  31,700,000and has been estimated at&apos;  28,228,000 for next year.       it covers something like 2o2 million prescriptions a year, anaverage of about 5 per head of the population.      Here there ought to be scope for saving,  if ways and means can be found.While flagrant abuse may be the exception,  it is obvious thatthere is more prescribing than can be really necessary.22. The first approach is to try to check expenditure from the prescribing end.      hny full scrutiny of all prescription-tions, before payment, can be ruled out as utterly impracticable-able, and up to now, checking has been mainly by snap samplesonly.      This is now being supplemented.      First, a specialinvestigating unit is being established, to pick up more of the bad cases;    secondly, efforts are being made to increase thenumber of disciplinary proceedings and the publicity given tothem.23. Within the Central Health Services Council othersteps are being taken.      A sub-committee, under the chairman-ship of Sir Henry Cohen,  is trying to classify drugs andmedicines into some broad system of &quot;white lists&quot; of thosewhich can always bo freely prescribed, and other lists of those for -which special justification may have to be shown.      in theory there should be great opportunities,  in cutting outunnecessary expense  in &quot;proprietary preparations&quot;, for many ofwhich there may bo a cheaper and equally effective alternative.The subject is complicated by the prejudice of doctors against any intervention in their clinical judgment  of their patients&apos;needs;    but it  is clear that no effort ought to be spared toget from this professional committee the utmost possiblebacking on which to base more restrictive regulations.21+. The second approach is to try to cut costs at thedispensing end.      Chemists are paid the cost of the drugs pre-scrlbed, plus a dispensing fee for each prescription and plus&quot;on-cost&quot; allowances for their business overheads.      Thisshould not increase in exact proportion to the great number ofprescriptions now being dispensed.      A case is, therefore, tobe put to the Whitley Council for a reduction in the allowance.25. The cost of drugs has to be approached at the supplyend.      Numerous minor adjustments are already going on toreduce waste,  such as the better suiting of the size of manufacturers&apos; packets to the normal needs of the service;the use of reasonable bulk prescribing in cases,  such asschools or other institutions, where there is a convenientlygrouped need;    the possibilities of stocking doctors&apos; surgerieswith, some of the materials more often required in small amounts(to save prescribing separate packages for each patient).26. When this service was last considered it was decided -and announced - that a charge not exceeding 1/- would be recovered from the patient for each prescription.      Powers were obtained in the amending Bill,      But, as soon as methods ofgiving effect to this were considered in detail,  it becamemanifest that it was far more complicated than was at firstthought, because it would at once involve elaborate machineryfor the exemption of whole classes  of patient (such aspensioners) and because, when all the factors were taken intoaccount, the estimated saving would be reduced from some  10millions to some  5-6 millions.      Moreover,  in my own view,it would be indefensible to introduce the principle of charges for benefits into a &quot;free&quot; health service in this one limitedbranch, of the service alone.      If the principle of charges wereto be accepted., which I. am sure would be -politically unwise,  itshould on merits apply to other branches of the service at least

as much as to this, and there would be no possible justification for upsetting the whole main principle of a comprehensive&quot;free1&apos; service for this relatively paltry saving.      Moreover,in this particular field,  I am sure that we should do better to rely upon the method of controlling prescribing mentioned inparagraph 23 than to adopt this basic change in the  service.J therefore suggest that&quot;we should at least defer action onthis decision for the present.General dental service27. The cost of this service is now about  2+3 millions ayear,  and is estimated at  ki&apos;S millions for next year.      Thedentist is paid on the basis of a scale of fees for each kindof item of service carried out - extractions, dentures, fillingsand the like.      He submits his claim, for the work he considers necessary, to a Dental Estimates Board for approval - after theevent in most cases, before it  in those cases where some priorcheck is needed before he is allowed to begin.      If the Boarddoubt the necessity in any case, they refer it to the Depart-ment&apos;s dental officers, who investigate and advise whether thework is necessary.      When they approve the work, the dentist is paid.28. Thus, control of the validity of expenditure heredepends on the efficient work of the Dental Estimates Board.Here there has been a difficulty.      Although most of the generalsorting out of claims is done,  and can. be done, by a layclerical staff, the pin-pointing of doubtful cases must rest upon professional dental advisers - to whom all prima faciecases  of doubt should be referred.      The Board need some 12 or16 dental advisers for this work, backed by an effective team of Departmental dental officers.      They have at present only 3,while the Department&apos;s dental staff is also under strength.The reason is that the authorised scales of pay for these officers not only will not attract recruits but actually leads to a progressive loss of existing officers.      If reasonableincreases in the authorised scales were adopted now, the saving to the Exchequer in terras of queried claims and resulting cutsin claims&apos;-would, on all the evidence,  amply outweigh the slightextra cost in salaries.      This is now before the Treasury forapproval, and the urgency of allowing these increases cannot beove r-emphas ised.29. There is also a good case for increasing the numberof Dental Services Committees, which exist to investigatecomplaints for disciplinary action agaj.net dentists who abusethe scheme.      The best preventive of abuse is prompt disciplinary action, and publicity to that action.      This is already underdiscussion with the profession itself.30. An investigation is also in progress into the presentwholesale charges for dental materials, under the Ministry&apos;sSupplies Division, and the question of all dental materials,apparatus, and. equipment is now before the Monopolies and restrictive Practices Commission.31. There has already been one substantial cut in thedentists&apos;  remuneration.      A recent -enquiry by a specialCommittee, the &quot;Penman Committee&quot;, now yields further evidencefor pressing a reduction of anything up to 6% in the presentfees, v/hile another proposed investigation into the averageproportion to be allowed for practice expenses in paying thedentists may justify some further cut in the present arrange-ments.      Both of these opportunities are already being fullyexplored.-6-

32. Beyond this, there seem to be no other likely fieldsfor savings in this part of the  scheme unless more drastic changes - involving the imposition of partial charges for theservice to patients - are to be adopted.      These are open tothe  strong objections already mentioned in paragraph 12, andI should deprecate any such basic alteration of the wholeprinciple of the health service on the evidence of these early,and unreliable, experiences of its working.33. A longer term measure for relief of the cost of the dental service lies in more intensive research into theprevention of dental caries, by new methods of using fluoridesand the fluorination of water supplies.      This is being pursuedboth by experiment in this country and by enquiries abroad.Opticians and spectacles34. This is what is known as the Supplementary OphthalmicService, intended ultimately (a long time hence) to give wayto a hospital and specialist eye service.      Its present costis a little under  23 millions a year and is estimated at about 25:k millions for next year.35. There are three elements in the opt in c ions 1 remunera-tibn55 - fees for sight-testing, fees for dispensing, and thecost of the materials (spectacle frames and lenses/ supplied.36. Sight testing fees have already been cut once, andon the whole there is probably not much case for seeking tojustify further reduction.37* Dispensing fees do offer something like the &quot;over-heads&quot; -point which arises with the chemists - 1. e. , there maybe a case for establishing that overheads should not increasein automatic -proportion to the number of dispensings undertaken..This is under investigation how.36. Cost of materials is something to be watched, but little chance of a drop can be foreseen yet, unless the futureovertaking of demand by output  (estimated to occur about mid-summer, 1950) produces a more favourable field fore competitivecutting by manuf acturers.39- Experience has shown that more can probably be done to follow up suspected cases of unnecessary prescribing, with more disciplinary action against the optician, and there couldbe better machinery for discovering and checking the obtainingof duplicate sight tests, duplicate spectacles and unnecessaryfree repairs.      This will be undertaken to whatever extentproves practicable.4-0. Beyond this,  as with the dentists and the chemists,the only substantial cut in the present cost of this service would lie in imposing upon the patient some part-paymenttowards the cost of the spectacles which he obtains.      This is open to the general,  and in my view overwhelming, objectionto a basic alteration in the main principles of the this stage of our rather unreliable experience.Local Health Authority Servicesl+L The chief remaining pieces of-the- Health Service arethose in the hands of the Local Health Authorities - maternityfind child:welfare, home nursing and midwifery, home domestichelps in sickness,  ambulances, vaccination and immunisation,after-care,  the provision of buildings for health centres.These are trie only pieces which are not a total Exchequercharge, although the Exchequer meets 50&apos;/o of their cost in*c    Opticians are referred, to thro^opticM^ tafcej as^redispehsing1or provfsi on b of&quot;ope c t a

grant.      Their total is not, relatively, very large - some 30 millions a year - and on the whole the need is more forfurther development than for retrenchment.      There is no obvious field for economy, or for drastic administrativechanges.1+2. There is probably room for more effort to checkunnecessary use of the free ambulance services.      This is inhand up to a point, hospital authorities being asked to scrutinise more critically the way calls for ambulances and hospital cars are now often being exploited.      There may beopportunity to do something more here.      Also, there may be room for increasing charges made for the use of day nurseries(charges at present are confined to food and articles supplied)But this kind of modification is trivial in relation to the major costs of the Health Service generally.1+3. Domiciliary nursing services, especially midwifery,are relatively cheaper than their corresponding institutionalservices.      Whether there is room for greater emphasis on, anddevelopment of, domiciliary confinements and their related services needs considering with appropriate professionaladvice.kk* Broadly, however, these services seem to lie in afield in which any drastic reorganisation would certainly notbe justified on present merits.hiThiThe General picturethen, is the general picture.      The biggest item of expenditure in the health service lies in the hospital and specialist service.      Here,  the inevitable and proper conse-rjuence of making the service a national responsibility is thatwe must face a substantial and increasing charge on theExchequer.      It has to be emphasised that at present the increases in cost in running the hospital service are matched in theexperience of other comparable countries and are certainly notattributable merely to the fact of the Rational Health service in t!iis country.      The future burden of administration lies, inthis part of the service,  in ensuring that development, year by year, does not extravagantly exceed what is proper and inevitable.It is certainly not true that the cost of the hospital service is uncontrolled.      It would have been, and is, perfectly easy to cut this service&apos;s expenditure at any time,  to any level, butonly if the resulting situation is also accepted - that peopleneeding treatment must be turned away, beds closed and theservice curtailed.      Unless that situation is to be accepted, thegraph of hospital expenditure must tend to be a rising one;    the job of administration is to see that the rate of its climb is reasonable against the background of the national situation asa v/hole.1+6. The next biggest item is in the general medical,pharmaceutical, dental and optical services.      Here the problemso far has been different in kind.      It has been mainly one ofunpredictable demand by the public.      It seems, on our present information,  to be levelling out now so that we know betterwhere we stand for the future. .   It looks as though we now canbe fairly confident of the rate at which these services willrun.      There is good hope of reducing that rate.1+7. The local health authority services arc a relativelyminor part of the scheme.      Apart from any possible futured development of Health Centres, they seem to be already levelledout and to present no major problems of control.-o-

2+8. On this picture, the sensible course seems to be to concentrate on the kinds of administrative control which havebeen described.    To slash the health service now by curtailingbenefit or by importing the principle of&quot; charges to patientscould/.scarcely be justified at this very early stage of the evolution of the service - bearing in mind both the evidence-that the abuses natural to the public !s first enthusiasm forgetting all the benefits available are already levelling out,and also the vital psychological effect (not only at home butin almost all countries overseas) of the admission of failurewhich serious - amendment of the  scheme at this  stage would imply.      Nor would this kind of cutting constitute any trueeconomy, but only a transfer of part of the burden back fromthe public to the private purse.      If the course of the. service can be held steady at this stage, there seems every chance thatthere will be much calmer water ahead, and an ambitious socialadventure will be found to have been amply justified.      It is,in short, too early to. panic;    nor is there any good cause todo so.49* There is no doubt that the  atmosphere of opinionabout the health service has been unfortunately charged by thefact that it had -.unavoidably - in its opening stages to showthree sharp Increases in its estimated costs.     As we know,this was due to the almost complete impossibility of measuringin advance the behaviour pattern of the public in using it.We ore now getting over that stage, and the process of estimating can become more and more reliable as our experiencegrows.50. If the general decisions about the service are to beas I have suggested in this paper,  I can instruct my Depart-- -merit accordingly and we can concentrate now on all the detailedmeasures which, I have described - with any others which, from day to day, present themselves in the ordinary course ofad nun i s t r at i on.51. For convenience, the kinds of detailed administrativemeasure already being adopted or proposed to be adopted Inthis paper can be summarised as follows:-(1)    Hospital Service.(a) More detailed examination of local ManagementCommittee budgets by Regional hoards, theBeards&apos; total budgets then being examined by theMinister (already arranged.).(b) Better hospital costing, enablingapparent extravagance to be more easily detectedin the examination of budgets (already under way).(c) Regulation of hospital staff establishments byad hoc enquiry at each individual hospital, sub-sequent  increases requiring special approval.(d) Extension, as the facts are found to justify it,of central negotiation of bulk-buying contracts for hospital * s supplies lies.(e) Consideration of the report of the;committee onhospital administration of the Central Health.Services Council (expected shortly).(f) Prosecution of a special enquiry into the finance of the health service  (including hospitals) bySir Cyril Jones (recently appointed for thatpurpose).

(g) Continued control of capital expenditure byhospitals.  -(h) A further special enquiry by a new committee onhospital service administration, if the facts are found to warrant it.(2)    General Practit ionery Services.(i) Doctors.(a)    More action, with the Ministry of national insurance, to avert unnecessary certificationfor sickness benefit, with special attention to areas of apparently undue absenteeism (already under way).( ii) Chemists.(a) Special investigation to pick up bad cases ofover-prescribing by doctors, with more disciplin-ary proceedings and publicity for them (already under way).(b) Classification of drugs, with the backing of a professional committee,  for &quot;white list&quot; forprescribing, with others on lists for prescrib-ing only under risk of having to show justifica-tion - particularly in the case of &quot;proprietaries&apos;where a&quot; cheaper alternative exists (awaitingreport of the professional committee).(c) Cuts in the amounts payable for &quot;onecost&quot;overheads for chemists  (case being prepared forWhit ley Council).(d) Various detailed measures to reduce cost of drugs at the supply end (already proceeding).(iii) Dentists.(a) Better pay for dental advisers for the DentalEstimates Board and for dental officers of theDepartment to facilitate recruitment and there-fore enable more &quot;queried&quot; cases of dentists&apos;claims to be investigated (before Treasury now).(b) Increase in number of disciplinary committees for handling complaints of abuse by dentists (already under discussion with the profession).(c) More investigation of wholesale charges fordental materials  (already under way).(d) Move for a reduction in dental fees,  in the lightof the Penman Committee report,  and also an investigation of the &quot;practice expenses&quot; element in dentists&apos; pay (already under way).(iv)  Optical service.(a)    Investigation into present rates paid for&quot;overheads&quot; in the opticians&apos;  remuneration(under review now).

(b) Watch on the cost of supply materials,especially when supply begins to overtakedemand.(c) More action to follow up suspected excessiveprescribing,  and for checking abuse byduplicate eye tests and supply of spectacles.(3)    Local Health Authority Services.(a) Further effort to reduce unnecessary use ofthe free ambulance service.(b) Investigation as to the desirability ofincreasing the development of dornicilarynursing and midwifery services, in relief ofthe demand on hospitals.A.
