S E G R E TG. P. (50)  50 COPY,NO.7TH MARjOHj  1950CABINETHOUSING;    LICENCES FOR ERECTION OF NEW HOUSESMemorandum by the Minister of Health1* I ask for the approval of my colleagues for an amendment in the present system of determining the number of houses for theerection of which licences may be issued by local authorities,I consider that it will be necessary for a statement to be madeon the subject during the Debate on the Address in discussionof the amendment on housing of which, the Opposition have given notice.2, At present each local authority is authorised to issuelicences for houses up to a maximum of one-tenth of the totalnumber of houses allocated to them.    This has replaced the figureof one-fifth operative before the cut in the housing programmelast autumn.    I have come to the conclusion that the fixing ofan uniform maximum for each district takes insufficient accountof their varying requirements and, now that the municipal housing programme is firmly established, I think that we ought to intro-duce greater elasticity into these arrangements,3. For this purpose I think that the principle on which weshould base our action is &quot;consumer need&quot;, and that our arrange-ments should make it possible for each local authority to decideby reference to the ascertained demand from families who are in need of separate homes what proportion of new houses are to be built by themselves or by others under licence.    The total amountof the allocation will,  of course, remain unaffected by any suchdistribution,h* Local authorities already know the number of applicants for Council houses.    They can readily find out how many families in need of a home desire to build one for their own occupation.5. I propose that it should be open to a local authorityto distribute the allocation of houses to be made to them for1951 between houses to be built by the Council and houses to be built under licence In accordance with their judgment of theneeds of the applicants.6. It would bo necessary to allow time for the local  .authority to-weigh up the respective needs of the variousapplicants and to give applicants for licences time to complete their preparations for building before licences were actuallyissued.    For these reasons it would not be feasible to make thearrangements operative before the beginning of 1951, but I should wish to inform local authorities of the arrangements as soon asI am able to inform them of the allocations for 1951*7. I should take administrative action to ensure that localauthorities do not neglect the needs of applicants for council houses,A. B.Minis try of Health, S.W. 1, ,7TH MARCH,  1950.
