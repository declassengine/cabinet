IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)secret . P. (50)  5 COPY NO.   OI9TH JANUARY,  1950CABINETPROPOSED INCREASES  IN PAY FOR medical and DENTAL OFFICERS  IN THE FORGESMemorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 7th November,.1949 (CM. (49) 64thConclusions, Minute 6), the Cabinet considered a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health.(CP. (49) 220) listing various classes of case affecting the health services in which it was difficult to apply the recentstatement&apos; of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that &quot;nothing -and I mean literally nothing - should be done to increasepersonal incomes&quot;.      Included among these (category (iv)) wasa group of cases &quot;where a breakdown in an important service mayhave to be faced unless some adjustments are made&quot;, and in thecourse of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that theService Departments were facing a similar problem in relationto the Forces Medical and Dental Services.2. The Cabinet did not reject the suggestion that increases in pay might have to be granted in the cases des-cribed;    the Health Ministers were invited to discuss them indetail with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3- I understand that the Health Ministers have not yetbeen able to present their detailed proposals to the Chancellorof the Exchequer.      A proposal for increased pay for Servicedoctors and dentists has,  however,  recently been made to theTreasury.      In the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s view thisproposal, if approved, would have very serious reactions on thegeneral stabilisation of incomes policy.      He has thereforedeclined to consider it.4. The increases in pay proposed for Service medical officers range from 3/- to 11/- a day ( 55 to  200 per annum);it is also proposed to increase the additional pay forspecialist medical officers by amounts varying from 3/- to 4/-a day.      These are large increases but, in the view of theService Ministers and myself, they are fully justified not onlyin relation to the current level of earnings of medical officersin the National Health Service but also by the very seriousrecruiting position which has arisen because of the superiorattractions, financial and otherwise, of the National health service.      They are incidentally, considerably lower than the increases&apos; proposed by the British Medical Association, from whomstrong representations on the subject have been received.5. The present  strengths of the Forces Medical services are as f ollows:-PermanentShort ServiceNational ServiceNavy	Army	R. A. F.280	418	20999	163	67115	900	549494	1 ,481	825

For the moment, these strengths are numerically adequate forthe Wavy and R. A.F. , though the Army is 122 medical officersbelow establishment. But the situation is otherwise highly-unsatisfactory in the following respects:-(a) In the Army and R. A. P.   the proportion of NationalService doctors is obviously far too high both forefficiency and for economy.(b) Even the numerical position is steadily deterioratingowing to the serious falling off in recruiting.Moreover,  after the war, priority for admission tothe Medical Schools was given to ex-Service men, andthere is in consequence a continuing tendency for thegreat majority of prospective medical students, whileawaiting vacancies in the Medical Schools, to undergotheir National Service training before embarking ontheir medical training.      The number of NationalService doctors available to the Services will-   therefore inevitably decrease to negligible propor-tions by 1952/3.(c) In the Army a number of short-service and evenpermanent medical officers have applied to resignand are being prevented from doing so only becausethe Royal Army Medical Corps alone has been excluded from an otherwise general removal of thepost-war ban on voluntary resignations and retire-men ts from the Army.(d) National Service doctors cannot,  in view of theirshort periods of service, be trained as specialists,and there is consequently an extremely serious and growing shortage in this sphere.      The figures of specialist strengths as compared with establishmentare as follows:-	Navy	Army	R. A. F.Establishment	95	k37	1 20Strength	95	3+5	9kDeficiency	Nil	122	266, All possible measures have been taken to alleviatethis shortage of specialists, which is most serious in the Army(e,g.   in surgeons the shortage is h3 per cent).      These measuresinclude: . close inter-Service co-operation;    the employment oflocal civilian specialists including those of the ColonialMedical Services overseas:    and, more recently with the agree-ment of the Treasury, the inviting of civilian specialists tojoin the Army Medical Service on short-term engagements ascivilians with rates of pay far in excess of those offered toForces medical officers of comparable ages and qualifications.The response to this offer has been very poor.      Indeed none ofthese measures is likely to afford more than temporary andinadequate relief.7. The fact that there is a serious and increasingshortage of applicants for permanent and short-service commissionsin the Forces Medical Services is well known to the british medical Association and is also becoming known to the House andto the public.      The British Medical Association have indeedonly been restrained with difficulty from publicising the facts and advising the profession of their views on the inadequacy ofthe remuneration offered to medical officers by the Forces.The Chairman of the Parliamentary Medical Group has made repeated

representations to me on this subject.      The shortage ofsurgeons in Malaya was recently the subject of questions in theHouse and of a series of damaging articles in the YorkshirePost.8. The plain facts are therefore that the medical services of the Forces, which include many young National Service,men, and which are both actually and. potentially engaged inactive operations overseas,  are already strained to the limits of safety;    that no measures short of substantial pay increasescan alleviate this situation;    and that if such pay increases are not granted the situation must deteriorate rapidly and aserious breakdown is probable.      The effect on Service morale and efficiency, to say nothing of the political consequences,of such a breakdown need not be stressed.9. A situation not less serious in degree exists in theForces Dental Services, and parallel increases in pay and specialist pay are proposed for them.      The total annual costof the proposals including both Medical and Dental Officers is 395,000, made up of  373,000 for increases in pay and  20,000for increases in specialist pay.10. I fully realise the difficulties which face thatChancellor of the Exchequer in acceding to this proposal.Essentially, however, what is proposed is no more than that the remuneration of one group of doctors in the employment of theState should be brought into reasonable equality with that already established for another group of doctors similarlyemployed.      And I should have thought that,  on these lines, a distinction might be drawn between the generality of claims forincreased pay and a case such as this where increases for aparticular branch of a particular profession are necessary solelybecause another, and numerically the largest, branch of the sameprofession has established rates of remuneration which can only have the effect of drawing people away from a smaller but no less important branch.       It &quot;is clear,  at any rate, that the issues involved for the Services in this matter are so grave&apos; thatI must refer them to the Cabinet.      For my part I must urge thatthe increases proposed should be granted, if following detailed discussions with &quot;the Treasury they are agreed to be justified.11. I ask the Cabinet to agree therefore that the present rates of pay of Medical and Dental Officers in the services should be reviewed and to decide that if it can be established that these rates are inadequate in relation t-o the earnings of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service, they shouldbe increased.A. V. A.Ministry of Defence, S.V/.1.9&apos;TH JANUARY,  1950.
