THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. P. (50) 3 COPY NO.9TH JANUARY,  1950CABINETTOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS MARKETING scheme memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agricultureand fisheries the memorandum by the President of the Board of Tradeabout the Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme (CP. (50) 2)raises some important questions of policy which I wish to bring to the notice of my colleagues.2. Orderly marketing is an essential feature of Govern-ment policy.      The original Agricultural Marketing Act of 1931was initiated by a Labour Government and in the past SessionParliament passed the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1949s whichin effect reaffirmed the general principles of the earlier Actsbut introduced additional safeguards against any possible abuse of their powers by Marketing Boards.      When the 1949 Act wasdrafted, it was regarded by the Cabinet and by Parliament as providing adequate powers to preserve the interests of consumers,and the public interest in general.      If we now decline toinclude in the Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme provisions which the promoters rightly regard as essential to its effectiveoperation, the agricultural industry will conclude that theGovernment have no faith in their own legislation and arerefusing to implement their own policy.3- Restrictive powers are implicit in the provisions ofthe Agricultural Marketing Acts, one of the main objects of whichIis to enable a majority of producers of a commodity to compel arecalcitrant minority to conform to action which is in thegeneral good.      Marketing Boards must take fairly wide powers,otherwise every new activity that experience proves to benecessary would involve an amendment to the Scheme, considerable expense, a delay of at least six months, and   probably   a freshapproach to Parliament.      There are, however, very wide powersof Ministerial intervention in the event of actual or prospectiveabuse of those powers and under Section 4 of the 1949 Act pre-preventive action can be taken by the Agriculture   Ministers at very short notice pending further enquiry if necessary by thestatutory independent Committee of Investigation.      ThisCommittee has functions similar to those of the monopolies commission, and an interlocking membership.4, It is therefore possible to take immediate actionwhere perishable goods, such as fruit or vegetables, are con-cerned, e. g.  if a Marketing Board were to seek to impose minimum prices below which tomatoes could not be sold to the detriment; of consumers.5. No horticultural products enjoy the benefits of: guaranteed prices and assured markets under Part I of the agriculture Act, 1947, but such producers were assured at thetime that other means would be found to enable them to havesimilar stability.      If this class of producer is not to beallowed to frame effective marketing schemes,  including powerto control prices at which producers sell their products, their main opportunity to achieve some measure of stability will be lost.

6. All previous experience shows that Marketing boards have a high sense of responsibility and do not act unreasonably.They have always realised their duty to the public and thattheir function is to facilitate the sale of the maximum quantityof goods.      Production of milk and bacon increased substantially in the five years before the war under the influence of marketing boards.      In general prices were not increased but were stabilisedat a reasonable level to the benefit of both consumers andproducers.7. The  restrictive powers in the Scheme are designed togive the public a better quality article and to improve methodsof marketing and distribution for which there is admittedly con-side rable scope.      For this purpose the Board seeks some controlover channels of sale, grades,, marking, packing and transport.8. The main criticism at the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L. P. (h9) 22nd Meeting, Minute 1) was directed against the granting of price fixing powers to a Marketing Board.      these powers are derived from Section 5(c)(ii) of the 1931 Act.if Parliament and the Cabinet had thought such powers to be undesirable they would have taken the opportunity of the 19k9Bill to rescind them.      No such action, however, was taken andit must be assumed that the new powers of intervention by theAgricultur o   Ministers were then regarded as a sufficient safe-guard against abuse.      Nothing has happened since to invalidatethat assumption.9. Our liberalisation of imports policy is alreadycausing apprehension among fruit and vegetable growers, and ifthis Scheme is rejected or substantially modified, their fearswill be intensified..    This feeling of uncertainty about thefuture has already led to a significant decline in the acreageof vegetables in 194-9 and any further cause for lack of confi-dence is likely to have further adverse repercussions on home production, which would not be confined to horticulture.Moreover,  if we should decide that some regulation of imports is essential to prevent a glut,  regulation of home production would also be necessary in view of our obligations under theHavana Trade Charter, and the latter could best be effectedthrough a Marketing Board.10. I would,  therefore, strongly advise my colleagues to approve this Scheme with the amendments proposed to Articles 70and 73*      I am quite willing to maintain close consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Pood onany questions that may arise as regards the activities of the marketing Board.T.
