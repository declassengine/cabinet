Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1950SECRET Copy No3 1CP. (50) 49th January, 1950CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT MAN-POWERMemorandum by the Minister of Health1. The original discussions between Government Departments and localauthorities on the topics which form the main subject matter of the First Reportof the Local Government Man-power Committee were held under the aegis of myDepartment following a Ministry of Health circular on man-power issued in June1947. It may therefore assist my colleagues in considering the Report if Iindicate shortly the main features which are important from my point of view.2. The principal object of this first stage of the Committee&apos;s work has been to eliminate unnecessarily detailed supervision by Government Departments overthe affairs of local authorities. This is not only desirable for its own sake since otherwise local authorities cannot be expected to develop a proper sense of respon-sibility for the management of their own affairs but it is also a necessary preliminary to any real drive to secure economies of man-power in local government since without some such clearing of the decks the local authorities can arguewith some show of plausibility that they cannot reduce staffs unless Whitehallfirst reduces its requirements in the matter of departmental supervision. Thekeynote, therefore, has been to decentralise detailed control with a view to simpli-f ying the transaction of business and saving man-power both in Whitehall and inthe local authorities. Many of the existing procedures grew up almost byaccident according to the circumstances in which different services were originatedand developed. The purpose of the Committee has been to cut out unnecessaryprocedures wherever possible, while retaining firm control at the points whichreally matter. The guiding principle has been to isolate the key points and to concentrate departmental control at these points, while setting the local authoritiesfree to settle the details. One of the principal methods recommended for doing thisis to work on the basis of annual programmes instead of requiring the submission of every particular scheme or project, however small. This retains for theDepartment all the necessary control over the financial outlay of the local autho-rities and over their investment programmes; and large schemes and projects of anovel or special character will continue to be submitted individually. I am satisfied that the recommendations of the Report will not involve any weakening of essential financial control over local authorities; on the contrary, I think theymay well provide a new incentive to economical management, since they will givethe local authorities a stronger sense of responsibility for running their own affairs.3. The Appendices to the Report are, I understand, condensed summaries ofmore detailed recommendations which have been accepted by the Committee on. thebasis of the Reports submitted by the various Sub-Committees. Though they areno doubt intelligible to those in central and local government who will have to workthem, they do not always give a very clear picture to a reader unfamiliar with thesubject-matter of the effect of the recommendations. I thought, therefore, that itmight be useful to my colleagues to show in tabular form the effect of the changes proposed in one important category of the recommendations, viz., those relating38115
to building schemes. This is given in the Appendix to this note, which sets out some examples of the changes as applied to housing, schools, police stations and road works.4. If, as I hope, the Cabinet accepts the recommendations, I feel that we;can confidently approach the local authorities in the knowledge that the Govern-ment has played its full part in clearing the ground and paving the way foreconomies of man-power. The next stage of the Committee&apos;s work is to see thatthe man-power economies are actually brought about. On the Government sideit will be the responsibility of the Departments themselves and the Treasury tomake sure of this. On the local government side we shall have to keep up the pressure. It is most important that the local authorities should be kept up to the mark in this matter and that they should seriously address themselves to the task of improving their internal efficiency and reducing staffs. I propose to put this to them strongly at a meeting with the Local Authority Associations which I amholding immediately after the Report is published, and I am sure I can count onthe support of those of my colleagues who are concerned with local authority services.A.

Under the Committee&apos;s recommendations local authorities who are local planning authorities will no longer require planning permission for their own work in their own areas.The majority of changes in the Ministry of Education procedures were made in 1949.   For schools, therefore, the &quot; Previously &quot; column shows the procedure in 1948.Roads The changes in procedures for wordworks do not fit into the above table, but are illustrated by the examples given below:PreviouslyEstimates of maintenance required to be split between different roads and particulars given of each minorimprovement above  2,000Maintenance   and   MinorImprovement of RoadsMajor ImprovementsTendersAll major improvement schemes have been subject to individual approval and detailed plans and estimatesrequired for each oneSubmission of tenders for approval before acceptanceIn futureGlobal estimates for each class of road (i.e., Class I, II, or III) will suffice for maintenance including work hitherto defined as &quot;minor improvement&quot;costing less than  5,000.
