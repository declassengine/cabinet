Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1950SECEET Copy No.    3CP. (50) 8\2th January, 1950CABINETPRESS ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS BY ministers note by the Prime minister the normal rules governing Press articles and interviews by Ministers are set out in CP. (49) 95, paragraphs 45-49, as follows : &quot; 45. Ministers are precluded from journalism in any form; but thisprohibition does not extend to authorship of writings of a literary, historical,scientific, philosophical or romantic character. For these there are abundantprecedents.46. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring Ministers fromwriting, on occasion, articles or letters to newspapers, in order to supplement the means already used for enlightening the public in regard to measuresbefore Parliament and other administrative questions affecting the work oftheir Departments.47. Should a Minister deem it necessary to write such an article, heshould not accept payment if it is offered. In deciding whether to write anarticle he should bear in mind his obligations to Parliament. For example,he should be careful not to discuss a Bill before it has received its SecondReading in the House of Commons.48. These rules govern dealings with the foreign as well as the homePress.49. The granting of special interviews to individual Press representa-tives is a matter for the discretion of the Minister concerned. As a general rule, however, the same considerations should apply as for written articles,i.e., if granted, an interview should be confined to elucidating the policy orwork of the Minister and Department concerned. The same considerationsregarding obligations to Parliament also apply, and Ministers should bearin mind that an interview granted to a representative of a single newspaperor agency may arouse jealousy and thus hostility in the rest of the Press.&quot;38133[p.t.o.
2.   In present circumstances greater freedom may properly be allowed,!Ministers may give interviews to the Press, and, in accordance with precedentwhen Parliament has been dissolved they may also write articles in any news-papers in prosecution of the Governments aims, or in defence of its policyNo payment may, however, be received for such articles.3. As soon as the Election is over the normal rules set out in paragraph jabove will again apply.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,12th January, 1950.
