Statement on Defence 1950INTRODUCTION1. The British people wish to live in harmony with other nations and anenduring peace is a necessary foundation for British ideals of social develop-ment. Until world peace can be assured by an effective system of collective security under the United Nations, it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to seek security through the development of collective self-defence,within the framework of the United Nations Charter, in co-operation with theother members of the Commonwealth, the United States of America and otherlike-minded nations. For these purposes adequate defence forces continueto be necessary and no drastic reductions can be made so long as the presentunsettled international situation persists.2. Defence policy is based on the assumption that we should not standalone in resisting aggression. Co-operation and consultation with other mem-bers of the Commonwealth have always been the core of our defence policyand have continued to make satisfactory progress. But now, in addition,specific engagements have been made with other peace-loving nations in the brussels and North Atlantic Treaties. Collective self-defence was embodied in Article IV of the Brussels Treaty and in the Western Union defence organisation set up under it. It was carried a significant stage forward inthe North Atlantic Treaty signed in April 1949.3. The initial stages of Western Union development were set out in lastyear&apos;s Statement on Defence(x) and the work there described has been con-tinued. At a meeting of the Brussels Treaty Consultative Council inMarch 1949 it was agreed that, although United States help would be needed to relieve many of the major deficiencies in the equipment of the western union Powers, those Powers must themselves contribute further to their mutual defence. Plans were accordingly worked out for increased produc-tion of equipment as a contribution to the defence of Western Europe. Thiswill of course assist in the defence of the North Atlantic area. In 1949-50as our first contribution we made available to France, Belgium and theNetherlands considerable quantities of aircraft and related equipment in orderto enable these countries to build up their air defence. In 1950-51 this assistance will be continued and we shall also increase the production of equipment for our own forces, the cost of these measures being, of course,reflected in our own defence budget for 1950-51. In addition, we have continued to give help to other members of the Commonwealth in meetingequipment needs for which they could not themselves provide.4. The signature of the North Atlantic Treaty raised new problems and progress has been made towards their solution during the last twelve months.The necessary organisation has been established and is working from theCouncil and the Defence Committee down to the regional and supplyorganisations. The detailed machinery has already been described in a white paper.(2) An overall strategic concept for the defence of the area has been drawn up and endorsed by the Council of the North Atlantic treaty organisation. The United States Congress has passed a Mutual DefenceAssistance Act.   Under that Act military aid becomes available when the Cmd. 7631.       v      - (2) Cmd. 7883.
overall strategic concept for the defence of the North Atlantic area has beenapproved by the President of the United States and bilateral treaties havebeen negotiated. These requirements having been fulfilled, United States aidwill take two main forms : first, actual equipment, and, secondly,reimbursement of the dollar costs incurred by other North Atlantic treaty powers as a result of increases in their own armament production. Under thefirst head the most important provision so far as the United Kingdom isconcerned is for the equipment of some squadrons in Bomber Command with aircraft of the B. 29 type. Under the second we may recover some of the dollar cost of raw materials used in the additional armament productionundertaken as a contribution to the defence of the North Atlantic area.5. The defence responsibilities of the United Kingdom Government arenot, however, limited to those assumed under the Brussels and North AtlanticTreaties. The Middle East is a vital strategic area and the maintenance ofour position in the tar East is essential to the security and economic well-being of the Commonwealth. We must therefore maintain our position inthese areas. Furthermore, we have to distribute our forces in such a way as to meet the current burdens of garrisoning the occupied territories andreinforcing local security measures. During the past year, though theirincidence has varied, these burdens have not been lightened. We have beenable to withdraw our forces from Greece, but we have had heavily to reinforce Hong Kong. We have not been able to reduce the forces needed in Malaya.6. To meet these heavy responsibilities, expenditure totalling  780million will be required in the next financial year. The numerical strengthof the forces can, however, be reduced : in fact, the main change in theuse of our resources as between 1949-50 and 1950-51 is that we shall havefewer men in the forces but shall spend more on equipment and research.The uniformed strength, which it was previously planned to reduce to750,000 by 1st April, 1950, will now be brought down to 718,800 by thatdate and to 682,100 by 1st April, 1951 more than 100,000 below the strengtha year ago. (See Annex I.) On the other hand, we propose in 1950-51to spend nearly  35 million more on equipment and research than in1949-50.7. This reduction in man-power will not materially affect the strikingpower of our forces. Maintenance and training establishments, alreadyseverely pruned, are being further reduced. Headquarters staffs are beingfurther cut. The reductions are made possible partly by the gradual returnto more normal conditions, and partly by the continuous process ofeconomising in fields of secondary importance in the interest of the strengthof fighting formations. This process has been greatly helped by a compre-hensive inter-Service review of the future development of the forces whichthe Government put in hand just over a year ago in order to establish theroles of the three Services in present circumstances and to ensure that full value was obtained for the money spent on the defence budget. This reviewmade it clear that there were no grounds for any substantial change in therelative roles of the three Services, or for any drastic curtailment of thestrength of any one of them. It was of particular value in estab-lishing priorities and in indicating where reductions could be made with theleast serious consequences.8. Further details with regard to each of the three Services will be givenin the Memoranda appended to the Departmental Estimates but the following paragraphs give a broad summary of the effect of the general plan on theServices as a whole.
9. The allocation of the net defence budget for 1950-51, with com-parative figures for 1949-50, is as follows : admiralty war office air Ministry  ...Ministry of supply ministry of Defence1950-51	1949-50 m.	 m.193 00	189-25299 00	304-70223-00	207-4565 00	57-75-82	-71780-82	759-86An analysis of the estimates is given in Annex II with an indication of themain differences between 1949-50 and 1950-51.Navy10. The new naval construction planned in 1950-51 will consist mainly of the continuation of work on existing programmes and only small ships are due to be laid down. To meet expenditure on essential modernisation of our existing fleet and other essential services it will, however, be necessaryto find economies elsewhere and naval man-power will fall to 127,500 by 1st April, 1951. The reductions will be mainly in man-power ashore and inbase establishments.11. The expansion of naval forces that would be necessary in the eventof war would be achieved by the bringing forward of ships at present in reserve. The maintenance of the Reserve Fleet is accordingly a task of greatimportance, and accounts for an appreciable proportion of naval expenditurein money and men.Army12. By 1st April, 1950, the numbers in the Army will be 15,000 belowthe estimate in the previous Statement on Defence. A further reduction of20,000 will be effected by 1st April, 1951, when the strength will be 356,600.In the main, the reduction will be in headquarters, maintenance and training establishments. The Army is still called upon to fulfil wide commitments allover the world and to some extent therefore the provision of the most modern equipment for future use must yield to the urgent present need for trainedman-power.13. The size of the Territorial Army will start to increase rapidly aftermid-1950 when the inflow of national service men begins. When fully developed it will consist of anti-aircraft artillery units, a Field Force, homedefence units, and administrative units designed to provide backing for both the regular and territorial armies in war. Recruiting for the Supple-mentary Reserve will be opened on an expanded scale.Air Force14. The number of men (202,400) in the Air Force on 1st April, 1950,will be about 10,000 below the planned figure but little further change duringthe year is contemplated. The plan for doubling the jet fighter strength of fighter Command will be completed and the power of Bomber Commandwill be increased  by forming squadrons of B. 29  aircraft as a  result
of American aid. Other Commands, except Transport, will remain broadlyat their present strength. With the gradual build-up of Bomber Commandthere will be a reduction in the air transport force at home but we shallretain enough transport aircraft to enable us to make an important contribu-tion to another airlift operation should that become necessary.Research and Development15. In the past substantial provision has been made under this head andthe provision for 1950-51 will exceed that for the previous year. The research and development programme is co-ordinated and priorities are determined onthe advice of the Defence Research Policy Committee. This is essential.The full list of problems that the Services would like solved would require a far larger part of the total scientific and technical effort of the country than can be justified. It is, therefore, a question of selecting those projects whosesolution is most vital to our defence and seems most likely to be achieved in the not too distant future. Needless to say air defence and anti-submarineresearch are receiving much attention.Colonial Forces16. A review of the colonial forces by the Chiefs of Staff Committeehas been followed by consultations with the Colonial Governments concerned and, in the case of the East and West African colonies, by a conference inLondon. The basic difficulty is that the cost even of the forces required for internal security is often beyond the means of the colony. Means ofbridging the gap are under consideration.Summary17. To sum up: a thorough review has been undertaken from an inter-Service point of view of our present forces and the money allocated for theirupkeep and development. The conclusion reached is that the existing balance between the forces is about right. On the Army and Navy together we shallspend about the same in 1950-51 as in 1949-50. On the Air Force and on research and development (much of which is for the Air Force) we shallspend rather more than an extra  20 million. So long as our present responsi-bilities and commitments remain, our defence budget must be a heavy one,but His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the money to be made avail-able in 1950-51 will be spent to the best possible advantage.MAN-POWER18. In the man-power field there are two issues of prime interest and importance : regular recruitment and national service. All will agree thatas many as possible or our peace-time defence responsibilities should be met by regular forces. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that a position will bereached where we can rely far more on regular personnel to discharge our peace-time defence commitments. The primary object of national service(which will still be necessary in default of some major change in the inter-national outlook) would then be the production of trained reserves. Atpresent, however, we are a long way from this goal and national servicecontinues to meet two vital defence needs.   It provides (i) the only means of building up the large reserve of trained man-powerthat would be needed in a future war ; and(ii) the men needed in the Services to supplement the numbers which canbe raised by recruitment of regulars.
Regular Recruitment19. Table 2 in Annex I shows that a decline is foreseen during 1950-51in the number of men serving on regular engagements in the Navy and Army,and only a small increase in the Air Force. In the Navy this decline will result from a deliberate restriction of intakes to the level necessary to main-tain the approved strength. Limitations on man-power will also reduce to2,000 the Navy&apos;s intake of national service men. In the Army and AirForce, however, there will be a heavy wastage arising from the termina-tion of current engagements, particularly short service and bounty engage-ments. Regular recruiting to the Army during the year will probably not wholly offset this wastage and a fall of 7,000 in the numbers of men servingon regular engagements is expected. In the Air Force it is expected that therewill be an increase of 3,000.20. The recruitment figures for men and boys (other ranks only) for the calendar years 1948 and 1949 excluding those on regular engagements whoextended their period of service are given in the following table. Normalregular engagements and engagements under the short service and bountyschemes are shown separately:  Regular Recruitment 1948 and 19491948 1949Normal Regular Engagements Navy       ........... 18,000 16,200Army               ......... 25,400 18,400Air Force         ......... 9,900 10,300Bounty Engagements Navy       ........... 1,700 100Army      ........... 8,500 5,400Air Force        ......... 3,700 1,900Total-Navy   ......... 19,700 16,300Army......... 33,900 23,800Air Force      ...... 13,600 12,20021. The figures for the Navy represent the fulfilment of the desiredrecruiting programme. The figures for the Army and Air Force, however,fall considerably short of what is required. This is not altogether a matter for surprise. At the end of any great war there is always a general wish toget back to civilian ways of life and a consequent tendency to turn away from service with the forces. Five years after the end of World War I the totaluniformed strength of the armed forces had been reduced to 340,000. to recruit the men necessary to man forces on this scale was then a compara-tively simple matter. Table 2 shows that a far larger number is necessaryto-day. To carry out the Government^ aim to rely as much as possible on regular forces we need to recruit on a scale never before attempted in atime of peace and full employment.22. Clearly, a high level of recruitment cannot be expected unless Serviceconditions compete in attractiveness with those of civilian life. In presentcircumstances there are obviously limits, both practical and financial, to theimprovement of Service conditions but much has been and is being done.The expenditure on major new works to provide accommodation for personnel
in 1950-51 is estimated at  9-44 million, an increase of  2-64 million over the already high provision of  6-80 million in 1949-50. Reductions in the size of the forces have enabled some unsatisfactory accommodation to be evacuated. A considerable amount of work has been done in the redecorating,refurnishing and general rehabilitation of existing barracks, and in theimprovement of messes, both for officers and other ranks. Further schemesof modernisation are planned. Many improvements have been and are beingmade in botti living and working conditions in His Majesty&apos;s ships. Both incomfort, and amenities the post-war troopships are greatly in advance of anything to which the forces and their families have been accustomed inthe past.23. Considerable progress has been made in the provision of married quarters since the war. To enable greater progress to be made in theUnited Kingdom the Armed Forces (Housing Loans) Act was passed in 1949.The sum that can be borrowed under this Act over the next five years is fixed at  40 million. Money will be advanced only for Service quarterswhich are so sited as to be suitable for civilian occupation should theServices no longer require them. The immediate requirement at home is for about 30,000 new permanent houses for the Services as quickly as possible.With the help of the Act the Service Departments aim to complete them inthe next five years. A start will be made on between 6,000 and 7,000 houses in 1950-51. Married quarters for Service families overseas are also badly needed and it is planned to start building about 2,000 more new quartersduring the year 1950-51.24. No less important than the need to attract men into the Services isthe need to persuade them to remain when their original engagementsexpire. A longer average period of service means a smaller annual recruitingproblem. It also results in increased efficiency by conserving for the forcesskill and experience that would otherwise be lost, and increased economyby reducing the expenditure of time, staff and accommodation required fortraining purposes.25. During the past year arrangements for the orderly absorption of ex-regulars in civilian life have been consolidated and developed and this work will continue. Of the 37,500 ex-regular other ranks discharged fromthe forces in the period 1st August, 1948, to 31st July, 1949, only 450 wereunemployed in November, 1949, and of this latter number only 100 had had noemployment since discharge. The position in regard to officers is admittedlyless satisfactory, though even in this field some progress has been made. Theproblem of resettlement was a prominent feature at Conference Ariel held bythe Air Ministry in May, 1949, when there was a full and valuable exchangeof views between the Services, employers, trades unions and educationalinterests. It is clear that the trades unions and employers both approach theproblem with good will. In order to enable them to assist more directlythe Departments concerned, an advisory council has recently been set up under the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour with memberscovering the whole range of interests affected.National Service26. It has been suggested that the Government is confronted with a serious problem in disposing of the numbers available for national service. There isno foundation for this suggestion.   The numbers estimated to be available

An excess of this size cannot be regarded as a major problem.27. It has been the policy hitherto to control the annual intake ofnational service men by omitting when necessary one of the regular quarterlyregistrations. This method, which has the effect of raising the age of call-upby three months, has been applied once already and the present age of call-upis 18 years 3 months. The possible surplus of 40,000 in the intake during thenext three years could be dealt with by raising the age of call-up by anotherthree months over that period. It should not be necessary to raise the age at all during 1950 and 1951. Should it become necessary to raise the ageof call-up in 1952 or 1953, a long period of notice could be given and on present assumptions the minimum age of call-up at the beginning of 1953should not exceed 18 years 6 months.28. The table in paragraph 26 shows that in 1950-51 and succeedingyears a great many young men, whose period of whole-time national service was originally deferred in order that, for example, they might completecourses of training or apprenticeships, will become liable to call-up. The best possible use will be made by the Services of the ability and skill which thesemen have acquired in civil life. This is in the interest of the Servicesthemselves and also helps to ensure that the men return to industry with at all events no less skill than they possessed when they were called up.Some good work has already been done on these lines.29. Nevertheless, there is a limit to what can be done towards relatingthe abilities of the man and the needs of the Services. Despite the changes that have been made, Service trades are not wholly interchangeable withcivilian trades, and between Service and civilian life there is a wide difference in the proportions in which the various classes of tradesmen are required.Reserve and Auxiliary Forces30. The Services rely on their voluntary reserve and auxiliary forces to supplement the skilled men in their regular reserves. The War Office, inaddition, are dependent on the volunteer element in the Territorial army to provide the instructors for training the large numbers of national servicemen who will begin to pass into the Territorial Army for their reserve trainingafter the middle of 1950.   The following table shows the progress that has
	Strength	Strength		at	at		1st Jan. 49	1st Jan. 50	TargetRoyal Naval Volunteer Reserve	3,241	5,150	7,000Royal Marine Forces Volunteer			Reserve	177	500	700Territorial Army and Women&apos;s			Royal Army Corps (T.A.) ...	67,210	82,500	150,000Royal Auxiliary Air Force	3,509	5,900	29,000Royal   Air   Force   Volunteer			Reserve       .........	4,459	8,100	38,00031.   Though the build-up of the	Territorial	Army has	not been as satisfactory as the Government would have wished the quality of the volun-teers coming forward has been excellent, and everything possible is being done to ensure that the national service recruits will be adequately trainedduring their period of reserve training. The expansion of the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force and R.A.F. Volunteer Reserve has also been slow, butit is satisfactory that the number of pilots in these forces is already nearlyup to requirements.32. Important improvements in the organisation and effectiveness ofthe reserve and auxiliary forces were made in December 1949 by the auxiliary and Reserve Forces Act. This measure modernised the constitu-tion and powers of Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations. It alsosimplified the procedure for calling out reserves in a national emergency and provided for an increase in the number of reservists from all three Serviceswho would be readily available to meet minor emergencies overseas.Summary33. Broadly, therefore, the Governments policy for manning the Ser-vices is : first, to encourage by all practicable means regular recruiting and re-engagements ; second, to rely, as they must, on the continuance ofnational service to make up the numbers required to meet current commit -ments and to provide trained reserves ; and third, by ensuring that bothregulars and national service men are employed to the best advantage, tokeep the total numbers in the Services as low as possible, consistent withmeeting our commitments. No other policy is possible at the present time.The theory, for example, that regular recruiting could be improved to suchan extent as to make it unnecessary in the near future to employ nationalservice men otherwise than under training is quite unrealistic. The idea thatthe present principle of universality of national service should be abandonedin favour of a scheme under which a smaller number of men, selected byballot or otherwise, would be required to serve for a period of eighteen months or more is, in the Governments view, equally impracticable andinappropriate in a democratic community.CONCLUSION34: In 1945 the United Kingdom emerged victorious from nearly six years of war-a war in which she fought from the first month to the last.Of all the combatants on the Allied side she achieved the highest degreeStrength of Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, 1st January, 1949,and 1st January, 1950
of military and industrial mobilisation. These efforts, coupled with the directresults of enemy action, created problems of reconstruction sufficient to engage the country&apos;s whole energies for many years of peace. But no respitewas given and we were soon face to face with new problems. We canbe proud of our response to this new challenge. No nation facing our economic difficulties could have done more and our intention to stand firm and to play our proper part has been plain to all. The continued strain on the national resources affects every citizen. The country accepts it froma conviction of its necessity and also from the memory, instilled by past experience, that problems of defence and of national survival cannot be solved by ignoring their existence.

Notes comparing the Totals with those for 1949-501. Pay and Allowances of Service PersonnelA decrease of  13-82 million. Savings result from the decrease in average strength but are to a small extent offset byhigher overseas allowances since revaluation.2. Pay, &amp;c, of ReservesAn increase of  0-21 million.   Increases under this head are an inevitable consequence of the build-up of reserve forces.3.  Pay, Sec., of CiviliansA decrease of  5-35 million. The result of reduction in numbers following the economy measures enforced last autumn.4.  MovementsA decrease of  1 - 26 million. Increased transport charges overseas have partly offset the saving on account of lower strengths.5.  SuppliesA decrease of  0-44 million. This is the net effect of increases since revaluation in the cost particularly of oil and food and of decreases in numbers.6.  Production and ResearchAn increase of  34-43 million. This is largely on account of equipment and stores, particularly in connection with theadditional production programme.7.   WorksAn increase of  6-84 million. In addition up to  9-5 million will be spent on married quarters from the Defence HousingLoan. Terminal charges in the works votes have decreased from  9-16 million to  6-57 million in 1950-51. The main increases are on account of accommodation for the Services and of airfield and other urgent operational requirements.8.  Miscellaneous Effective services a decrease of  2-33 million. Provision is no longer needed for the Polish Resettlement Corps and a number of miscellaneouseconomy measures have been effected.9.   Non-effective ServicesAn increase of  2-68 million.   This trend will continue.Terminal charges the provision for war terminal charges is reduced from  13-26 million in 1949-50 to  7-55 million of which the major items are  6-57 million under the works head and  0-48 million for termination of contracts.QO
