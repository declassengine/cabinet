Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRETCP. (SO) 4927th March, 1950CABINETFUTURE OF EMERGENCY powers memorandum by the Lord President of the Council    &apos; .   11. I think it would be useful if the Cabinet took an early opportunity todiscuss the future of emergency powers, many of which are due to end onlOth December, 1950. The Lord Presidents Committee have three papers beforethem L.P. (50) 1 (Defence Regulations), L.P. (50) 10 (Emergency Statutes) andL.P. (50) 16 (Economic Controls); and I do not think that the Committee candeal with the mass of detailed questions which these papers raise without some general guidance from the Cabinet.2. The various powers which have been continued since the war in temporaryform may be divided into three broad categories : (a) The economic controls rest largely on certain Defence. Regulations whichwere continued in force for peace-time purposes by the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945.The Lord Presidents Committee have before them a report by officers of the Departments concerned (L.P. (50) 16) on the legal powers which would be required to continue present economic policies, andthe broad conclusion of officials is that, with the exception of defence regulation 58A (which relates to labour controls), the main existinglegal powers would have to be retained on a more or less permanent basis. The officials do not think it would be practicable &quot;to continueexisting economic policies on the basis solely of a few major controls(such as exchange control, import licensing and price regulation) ifthe use of other controls, such as those relating to production, werediscontinued. Their view is that, while the use made of the legal powers would vary from time to time, the powers themselves wouldhave to be retained if the Government were to be able to cope with changes in circumstances.A good many questions of machinery will also arise, such as theextent of the Parliamentary supervision of the exercise of Ministerialpowers.(&amp;) A large number of miscellaneous -powers touching almost the whole range of Governmental activities are preserved by defence regulations and by a few temporary Acts which are kept in force bythe Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, and theEmergency Powers (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947.While many of these are relatively unimportant, others deal withsubjects such as requisitioning, the employment of troops to main-tain essential services threatened by strikes and the powers of theMinister of Supply. The Lord Presidents Committee have beforethem two memoranda (L.P. (50) 1 and 10) setting out the views of departments on the length of time for which various Regulations andActs   should   be   retained.     Sorne   are   not   required   beyond38468Copy No. 32
10th December, 1950; others will be required... for a further year;while yet another group will be required &apos;ipr longer periods orpermanently.(c) A number of other temporary Acts were passed just before the war, orin its course, which were expressed as terminable when His Majesty,.m.. &apos; by Order in Council, declared &quot; the emergency which was the^bccasionof the passing of the Act &quot; to be at an end. V(   . v.,   r,   ,Proposals relating to these Acts are also before the! lord presidents Committee (L.P. (50) 10). They cover a very varied field.&apos;Some deal with important subjects, such as rent restriction and national registration, but many are concerned with matters whichexcite little public interest. Unlike the Defence Regulations, there isno fixed date for their termination and the manner in which theyare terminated is not likely to be the subject of legal challenge. Theircontinuance can best be considered on their individual merits as occasion arises.3. The Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, and theEmergency Powers (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947, both contain a provision to the effect that they may be continued in force on a year-to-year basis byAddresses from both Houses. The position is, therefore, that Addresses from both Houses would preserve all the existing emergency powers from 10th Decem-ber, 1950, to 10th December, 1951, and, if both Houses were agreeable, this processcould be repeated annually as long as the powers were required.Parliament would not, however, be willing to renew these powers-based on war-time Defence Regulations indefinitely from year to year. Even if Parlia-ment were willing to do so, Departments would be in a constant state of uncer-tainty as to the continuance of powers on which they depended.4. At some stage, therefore, a comprehensive settlement of the whole subjectmust be made, and the question now at issue is whether the Government do thissooner or later.My view is that the necessary Bill or Bills should be drafted now, for introduction at the beginning of next session, taking permanent powers ofeconomic control and of price regulation, subject to all proper Parliamentarychecks. We would aim at putting this legislation on the statute book before thepresent powers come to an end on 10th December, 1950; but we may not be in aposition to secure this and it may be necessary to ask both Houses to presentAddresses covering the whole field of emergency powers.It will be a matter for discussion whether the residue of temporary powers should be renewed from year to year by means of Addresses or whether they tooshould be the subject of legisdation.Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council, S.W. 1,&apos;   27th March, 1950.
