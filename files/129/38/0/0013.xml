Printed, for the Cabinet.   January 1950SECRETCP. (50) 13%th January, 1950CABINETBECHUANALAND   PROTECTORATE :    SUCCESSION   TOCHIEFTAINSHIP OF THE BAMANGWATO TRIBEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations my colleagues will remember that on 21st July (CM. (49) 47th Conclusions,Minute 8) I laid before them the question of the recognition of Seretse Khama as chief of the Bamangwato Tribe. The Cabinet decided that, before recognitionwas granted or withheld, a judicial enquiry should be held under the provisionsof the Bechuanaland Native Administrative Proclamation into Seretse&apos;ssuitability for the Chieftainship. The minutes of that meeting summarised &apos;&apos; thegeneral view of the Cabinet &quot; as follows : &quot; It could not be supposed that the recognition of Seretse would provide asatisfactory or lasting solution of the problem. The issue was not one of the merits or demerits of mixed marriages, and the Government should vigorouslyrebut any suggestion that their attitude to this question was in any way deter-mined by purely racial considerations. The principal objective of policy must beto safeguard the future well-being of the Bamangwato themselves, and there couldbe no doubt that the recognition of a Chieftain with a white wife might haveconsequences gravely prejudicial to good government and to the stability of thelocal native administration. As a matter of tactics, no attempt should be madeto reach a hasty decision; and the holding of a judicial enquiry would afford timefor reflection by all the parties concerned.&apos;&apos;2. The Judicial Enquiry has now completed its work, and the commission have now presented a report. The two main findings of the report are as follows : -&quot; (1) We are of the opinion that the Kgotla held at Serowe between 20th and25th June, 1949, at which Seretse Khama was designated as Chief ofthe Bamangwato Tribe, was properly convened and assembled, and its proceedings conducted in accordance with native custom;(2) that, having regard to the interests and well-being of the Tribe, SeretseKhama is not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of chief.&quot;Reasons why Seretse should not be recognised3. I have examined most carefully both the report and the evidence takenby the enquiry and have discussed them with the High Commissioner, Sir EvelynBaring, and I accept both the findings. The more important is of course thesecond finding, and for the following reasons I am fully convinced that Seretseshould not be recognised : (a) The decision of the Kgotla was influenced by the strong feelings of the tribe against the Regent Tshekedi (see paragraph 4 [a) below).(&amp;) Recognition would be contrary to the best interests of the Tribe. It would,I am advised, certainly lead to further disintegration. AlreadyTshekedi, who has had a fine personal record, has left the Reserve and38170 copy No. 31
has taken with him a number of the ablest and most important leadersof the Tribe. It seems inevitable that, if Seretse remained, factionfeeling would grow within the Tribe, and so would opposition to him from neighbouring tribes.(c) Seretse himself has shown evidence of irresponsibility which i makes it-4; .     doubtful whether he would, in fact, prove a wise Chief.  He marriedRuth precipitately and ignored appeals from the Bamangwato toreturn home first and discuss the matter. He has declared his inteivtion to choose as his principal adviser one of his uncles whom theJudicial Enquiry regard as quite unsuitable if this intention were carried out, they say, &quot; the Tribe would certainly suffer.&quot; He has beendrinking liquor, although this is contrary both to Protectorate law andto the Bamangwato custom; the Judicial Enquiry say that this is not,in itself, enough to make him unfit for the Chieftainship; but, in viewof the past importance of prohibition in the life of the Tribe, it addssomething to the other evidence of irresponsibility.(d) There is a strong body of African opinion outside the bamangwato reserve which is against the recognition of Seretse (see paragraph 4 (I)and paragraphs 5-8 below),     -r(e) A decision to recognise might unite and inflame public opinion in theUnion of South Africa. This might lead to either or both of the follow-ing results : (i) Dr. Malan&apos;s proposed demand for transfer of the Territories, the presentation of which, at this particular time, is opposed by alarge section of white opinion in South Africa, would receivethe warm and solid support of all sections of white opinion inthe Union. Recognition would, therefore, play directly intoDr. Malan&apos;&quot;s hand in the matter of the transfer of the Terri-tories.(ii) If the demand for transfer were resisted and Dr. Malan attempted to apply economic pressure, South African Europeans would,in the event of recognition of Seretse, give him far more whole-hearted support in these measures than he could otherwiseobtain.4. On the first finding of the enquiry (see paragraph 2 (a) above) I think-that the following considerations should be borne in mind. The decision of the kgotla which accepted Seretse in June does not necessarily mean that nativeopinion in southern Africa, or even native opinion in the Bechuanaland Protec-torate, approved of his marriage to a white woman, or considered that he shouldbe recognised as Chief. Thus (a) It is not clear that, by its decision of June last, the Kgotla was committingeven those who took part in it to any firm view in favour of Seretse&apos;smarriage. This issue was in fact brought before them on threedifferent occasions, in November 1948, December 1948 and June 1949.At the first meeting the marriage was almost universally condemned.At the second there was rather more support for Seretse. On the thirdoccasion the opinion swung heavily in his favour. But the report ofthe Judicial Enquiry makes it plain that this change of view wasinspired, not by a changed view about the marriage, but by the fear that if Seretse was rejected his uncle, the Regent Tshekedi, the nextlegitimate heir, would become Chief. Tshekedi has already as Regentadministered the affairs of the Tribe for 23 years. He has provedhimself to be able, honest and progressive; but in the words of thereport &quot;he has driven his people hard,&quot; and has become very ufl;popular. It seems clear that it was rather fear and dislike of Tshekedithan approval of Seretse and his marriage which decided the issue inJune.(6) There is strong evidence that much African opinion in the rest of the bechuanaland Protectorate is against the recognition of Seretse, Thesecond largest tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate is theBangwaketse. Their Chief Bathoen, who is well educated and pro-gressive and who is well supported by his people, gave evidence to theJudicial Enquiry against the recognition of Seretse. The thirdlargest tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate is the Bakwena. Their
Chief sent a representative to give evidence against Seretse. the tribe of the Barolong live partly in the Union of South Africa. Acertain Mokgaetsi, who frequently acts for the Chief, gave evidenceagainst the recognition of Seretse.Thus while no doubt some Africans in the Bechuanaland Protectorate support the kgotla&apos;s decision in favour of Seretse, it is clear that there is a strong body ofopinion on the other side.5. The High Commissioner has obtained information concerning african opinion in the other two High Commission Territories of Basutoland and Swazi-land, and in the Union. The Paramount Chief and his leading Counsellors inSwaziland informed him that they will support a decision by the United KingdomGovernment to refuse recognition to Seretse.6. Owing to recent events in connection with witchcraft and murder trials,it was considered inadvisable to make a direct approach to the African Chiefof Basutoland, but there is reason to believe that the Basuto would acquiesce ina decision of this nature.7. Enquiries made by the High- Commissioner in the Union indicate thatthe most prominent Africans there are strongly opposed to the recognition of seretse. The editors of the two vernacular papers with the widest circulation,and the Chairman of the African political association with the largest member-ship, have spoken to the High Commissioner strongly against recognition.8. Moreover, discussions with West African representatives at a Conferencein Nigeria recently suggest that African opinion outside southern Africa would either welcome, or at least acquiesce in, a decision not to recognise Seretse. Acopy of the relevant telegram is attached.Reasons Adduced by Judicial Enquiry9. I have given above the reasons why I accept the findings of the judicial enquiry : the reasons adduced by the Enquiry itself are as follows : &quot; (a) being a prohibited immigrant in the Union of South Africa^ Seretsewould be unable efficiently to carry out his duties as Chief;(b) a friendly and co-operative Union of South Africa and SouthernRhodesia is essential to the well-being of the Tribe and indeed thewhole of the Bechuanaland Protectorate;(c) Seretse&apos;s   recognition   would   undoubtedly   cause   disruption  in   the bamangwato Tribe.&quot;10. The first reason given by the Enquiry cannot be accepted as valid; since,if Seretse were otherwise suitable, ways and means would have to be found of enabling him to perform his duties as Chief without requiring him to visitMafeking. It is, of course, eminently desirable, as stated in the second reason,that the Union and Southern Rhodesia should be friendly and co-operative, andthe point is particularly important at present for the reasons given in para-graph 3 (e) above. But if the recognition of Seretse had been desirable on other grounds, the views of the Union and Southern Rhodesian Governments wouldhave had to be carefully considered.11. I have prepared a White Paper, which gives detailed reasons for mydecision, together with copies of the relevant documents. A copy of the draft white Paper is attached.12. In July, on the advice of my officials, which was endorsed by that ofSenator and Mrs. Ballinger,* I suggested to the Cabinet (CM. (49) 47thConclusions, Minute 8) that Seretse should be asked to come home and relinquishhis Chieftainship. The Cabinet rejected the suggestion of such action at that stage, on the grounds that it was open to mispresentation. If, however, we arenow to refuse recognition, it seems eminently desirable that Seretse should not he in the Territory when the decision is announced. I am advised by theOffice of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland protectorate and Swaziland that Seretse has indicated in recent conversations that an adverse* Elected by natives of the Union to represent them in the Senate and the Legislative AssemblyresPectively of South Africa.38170 b 2
decision would not surprise him, but that he would in such an event be veryhard up. The local authorities consider that he may agree fairly readily to goto London for discussion, and accept the offer of a generous allowance. The localauthorities also stress the advantages of an early announcement, since they statethat a decision could be announced without serious trouble now when the people are working in their fields and Serowe is comparatively empty, and on theassumption that Seretse is not in the Bechuanaland Protectorate at the time. Inview of these advantages I propose to cable to Seretse asking him and his wife tocome to this country. On his arrival I would inform him of the decision andoffer him an allowance and also help in finding useful employment.13. In order to make this decision more acceptable, it is also necessary to announce that Tshekedi will not become Chief, nor continue to be Regent, Hehas, in fact, already indicated that he would give up the Regency once a decisionhad been announced. The administration of the Reserve will be conducteddirectly by the Bechuanaland Protectorate Administration for the time being,It is not yet possible to foresee when it will be safe to reconstitute the NativeAuthority.14. Before this is done, I think we&apos;should have to examine the existing system of native government in the Bamangwato Reserve with some care. Atpresent it leaves much to be desired. The total number of Africans who live inthe Bamangwato Reserve and who are under the authority of the Chief of the bamangwato is 100,000. But the Bamangwato themselves number only 18,000;the rest are so called &quot; allies &quot; who are not represented in the administration.The inhabitants of the Reserve are widely scattered over a territory of 40,000square miles. In fact very few of them take part in a Kgotla except those wholive in the capital, Serowe. Of the 4,000 who attended the Kgotla which endorsedSeretse&apos;s Chieftainship in June last more than 90 per cent, were from Serowe.I am hoping to introduce a more representative system on the following lines :-(a) To each of the Chiefs representatives in the various districts of theReserve, a small Council might be attached, the members being drawn from the so-called allied tribes;(b) there might be regular arrangements for the representation of the outlyingdistricts, at the more important tribal meetings held at Serowe; and(c) some steps might be taken to explain that the Chief should act on theadvice of his Council and not on his own authority.We have been carrying out some similar reforms in Basutoland and Swaziland.But the bechuanaland, like some other African tribes, are intensely conservative andit would be fatal to try to introduce wholesale reforms very quickly. The changesmust be introduced gradually, and for this reason it would be unwise to publishfull proposals at the present time, since to do so might jeopardise the chances of their eventual acceptance.15. Immediately after I have seen Seretse, I will make a suitable announce-ment and publish the White Paper. If Seretse refuses to come, it will be necessaryto announce the decision as soon as local arrangements for simultaneous announce-ment can be made, and for the High Commissioner to remove him from the bechuanaland Protectorate.16. It is of the utmost importance that the decision should be announcedwithout delay since :  (a) Dr. Malan has announced his intention to present a demand by the UnionGovernment for the transfer of the High Commission Territories. I&apos;would be deplorable if the announcement of our decision hot to recog-nise Seretse should follow this demand and should thus appear to betaken, not on its merits, but under Dr. Malan&apos;s pressure. On the otherhand, an early announcement might possibly result in a demand for transfer not being presented at all.(b) Seretse&apos;s wife is due to give birth to a child in May or thereabouts^Seretse is unlikely to leave Serowe willingly without her; I am most reluctant to leave&apos; them both in Serowe for much longer. An offer of the  best medical attention in London in her confinement may prove astrong inducement.   If action is not taken in the next two or three
weeks it will for this reason have to be postponed until the latersummer, and I am convinced that the situation in the Reserve couldnot be more propitious for the announcement than at present, and mayvery well become much worse.Ic) The danger of minor disturbances (such as friction between Tshekedi andSeretse over the possession of the Chiefs cattle) and possibly of a major outbreak of violence, increases as time goes on.f0rall these reasons it is imperative that a decision should be reached immediately;jf we delay we may find that the position has deteriorated very seriously and our task may be made much harder.Smmary of Conclusions17.   I, therefore, ask the Cabinet to decide (a) that Seretse should not be recognised as Chief;(b) that Tshekedi should not become Chief and should not be re-instated asRegent;(c) that these decisions should be published in a White Paper, of which adraft is attached;(d) that before they are published, Seretse should be invited to come withhis wife to London, should be informed of the decision, and shouldbe offered an allowance and other help, provided he does not return tothe Bechuanaland Protectorate without the leave of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment;(e) that the administration of the Bamangwato Reserve should, for thepresent, be conducted directly by the Bechuanaland ProtectorateAdministration;(/) that the system of native Government in the Bamangwato Reserve should,by gradual stages, be made more representative.P. J. N.-B.Commonwealth&apos; Relations Office, S. W. 1,26th January, 1950.Copy of Telegram dated 24th January, 1950, to Sir Evelyn Baringfrom ClarkWhile in Basutoland I learned from King, Director of Livestock and Agri-fMltural Services in Basutoland, that at recent conferences at Joss, in Nigeria, he found great interest displayed by West African delegates in question of transfer.1&apos;was frequently raised in informal conversation and impression he gained wasthat they regarded United Kingdom Government^ action in the matter as a test)fgood faith which was very relevant to United Kingdom&apos;s promise of eventual^-government for West African colonies.2. By contrast they did not refer at all to Seretse question until King himselfbought it up. Even then they displayed only mild interest, but more than oneforked that Seretse appeared to have acted rather foolishly and irresponsibly.

DRAFT WHITE paper the circumstances which led to the appointment of a Judicial enquiry into the succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe in the bechuanaland Protectorate are described fully in the report of the Enquiry,which is appended as Annex. The following paragraphs summarise themain points. &apos;- 2. The Bamangwato Reserve in the Bechuanaland Protectorate is about40,000 square miles in area and has a population of 100,000 (the total popula-tion of the Protectorate is 300,000). The Bamangwato themselves numberonly some 18,000; the remainder of the population in their Reserve consists of Africans who originally belonged to various tribes but who have adhered to the. Bamangwato and owe allegiance to the same chief. The history ofthe Bechuanaland Protectorate has been marked by a series of tribal disputesabout succession to the chieftainship which, in one case, has led eventually to.the formation of four separate tribes whose ruling families derive froma common ancestor. The recent Enquiry was held to ascertain whetherSeretse Khama, who is the son of the last Chief of the Bamangwato and the undoubted direct heir, should be recognised as Chief. Seretse&apos;s fatherSekgoma died in 1925 and in 1926 Tshekedi Khama, a half-brother ofSekgoma, was installed as Regent.3. Seretse was educated in South Africa, where he obtained a Bachelorof Arts degree, and in 1945 came to this country to undertake legal studies,first at Balliol College, Oxford, and later in London.4. In September 1948 Seretse notified Tshekedi that he proposed tomarry an English girl in London on the 2nd October. When appeals weremade to him by the Native Authority of the Bamangwato Reserve and by others to postpone the marriage, Seretse advanced his wedding day and wasin fact married in a Registry Office on the 29th September.5. Three tribal meetings (&quot; Kgotlas&quot;), at which Seretse was present,were held in the Bamangwato Reserve to discuss the marriage. At thefirst, in November 1948, the tribe, with very few exceptions, condemnedthe marriage and resolved that all steps should be taken to prevent Seretse&apos;white wife from entering the Bamangwato Reserve. At the second meeting,in December 1948, support for Seretse was stronger; and at the third meeting in June 1949 there was a popular demonstration in his favour. There are,however, many indications that in accepting Seretse and his European wife,the tribe were strongly influenced by the prospect of ridding themselves of tshekedi. He had ruled the Bamangwato during the past twenty-three years.His rule was firm and enlightened; but recently he had clearly, though perhaps not justifiably, become unpopular. It is important to bear this inmind when considering the opinions expressed at the various meetings. Atthe first meeting, before the tribe were aware that Seretse would not under any circumstances give up his white wife, there was almost unanimous con-condemnation of the marriage. The subsequent meetings showed the increasingfear felt by the tribe that Tshekedi would displace Seretse and become their permanent Chief and a determination to avoid this at any cost.6. The Regent Tshekedi issued a formal statement after the June meeting in which he announced his intention to leave the Bamangwato country,declared that the recognised law and customs of the tribe had been violated,and challenged the validity of the Kgotla&apos;s decision. He asked that a judicial enquiry should be held to advise on whether Seretse should be recognised and if so what would be the position of his wife and children.7. The law which governs successions to Chieftainships in the bechuanaland-land Protectorate was promulgated in the Bechuanaiand Protectorate NativeAdministration Proclamation of 1943.   It provides that on the occurrence of
a: vacancy in a Chieftainship the Successor, shall be. designated, by. the tribeassembled.in Kgotla according to native custom. This-designation is, however,subject to recognition by the High Commissioner, for, Basutoland; the bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, and to confirmation by theSecretary of State, at their discretion. Tn the event of doubt arising, provision is made for the holding of a Judicial Enquiry to report to the High Com-missioner.  The relevant clauses of the Proclamation are as follows :-&quot;3. (1) Upon the occurrence of a vacancy in.the Chieftainship of atribe it shall be the duty of, the. tribe, assembled in Kgotla to designatethe former Chiefs successor according to native custom, op if the. person who under native custom is the rightful successor to the; Chieftainshipis a minor to designate a Regent according to native custom, to cause the name of the Chief or Regent to be submitted to the Resident Gom-missioner. with a view to seeking the High Commissioners, recognitionand the Secretary of S(ate.&apos;s confirmation of such designation c.Provided that where any doubt arises whether the person so designatedis, under native custom, the rightful successor to the Chieftainship orRegency, or is, by reasomof. an. allegation that.he is unworthy or incapable of exercising the same justly or for any other sufficient, reasons, a fitand proper person to discharge the. functions of Chief or Regent, theHigh Commissioner may direct that a Judicial Enquiry be held to enquire into the matter and to report thereon, to the High Commissioner, who shall then decide the matter.(2)1 In- the event of a vacancy in the Chieftainship-of a tribe andpending the designation of a Chief or Regent, the person who undernative custom is charged with the duty of summoning the tribe to assemblein Kgotla in order to designate the successor to the Chieftainship or to designate a Regent in terms of-this section shall act as Chief of the tribe.4.7-01) Every Chief may exercise the functions of his office as soon ashe shalL have been designated by the tribe as Chief, unless the HighCommissioner otherwise directs.(2) Jf the High Commissioner declines, to recognise or the Secretaryof State declines to confirm the recognition of the person designated as chief or. R.egent. in terms of sub-section. (1) of section three such person.. shall thereupon cease to exercise the powers and functions of the Chief-tainship and the provisions of. sub-clause (2) of section three shall againbecome operative.&quot;8,. In view of the situation which had arisen the High Commissionerfound it necessary in July, 1949 to recommend the appointment of a judicial enquiry into the question- of the recognition of Seretse. The Enquiry wasduly set up under the Proclamation of 1943. It should be borne in mind thatthe functions- of an Enquiry appointed under the 1943 Proclamation areadvisory; the decision is reserved&apos; to the High Commissioner, who is responsible to the Secretary of State.9. Oh the two questions referred to it. the Enquiry recorded the followingconclusion:  &quot; (1) We are of the opinion that the Kgotla held at Serowe between the20th-25lh June, 1949, at which Seretse Khama was, designated, as chief of the Bamangwato Tribe, was properly convened and assembled,and its proceedings conducted in accordance with native.custom.(2) that, having regard to the interests and well-being of the Tribe, SeretseKhama is not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of chief.&quot;10. His Majesty&apos;s Government have most carefully examined both. thereport and the evidence submitted to the Enquiry and have no doubt what-
ever that irrthe ^present circumstances it is not in the best interest of the tribethat Seretse Khama should be recognised.II. The following are the principal reasons which have led His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to their decision:  (w) They regard as of first importance the danger of serious disruption inthe Bamangwato Reserve and in the Protectorate. Signs of this havealready appeared in the Reserve in the departure of a number oftribal functionaries who have joined Tshekedi in voluntary exile.Among the seven tribes of the Protectorate outside the bamangwato reserve opinion is divided; the two most numerous and importanttribes are against tlie marriage, and, if Seretse is recognised as Chief,they may be expected to draw away from the Bamangwato. In thepast the Bamangwato have suffered much from feuds among membersof their leading families. The recognition of Seretse would giveoccasion for many disputes and would create many points of uncertainty. Peaceful administration would accordingly become increasingly difficult and a process of disintegration would set in.(b) In contracting a marriage, which by his own admission he knew wouldbe unpleasing to his people and would have grave consequences,without prior consultation and against all the advice tendered to him,Seretse showed himself to be utterly unmindful of the interests of the tribe and to be setting his private feelings above public duty. this raises grave doubts whether Seretse, who is in many ways an estimableyoung man, and whose devotion to his wife everyone must respect,would show himself a wise ruler, and whether he would retain thesupport of a tribe which is given to faction feuds and which is morethan likely to question his authority when it is satisfied that Tshekediwill not return. The existing tendency to disputes about the successionwould be aggravated by uncertainty whether the tribe would acceptthe rule of the children or grandchildren of a mixed marriage. Thereis considerable danger that, if Seretse were to become unpopular,claims would be made that his wife had never been properly accepted.(c) Among prominent Africans both in the High Commission territories and in the Union opinion about recognition or non-recognition is notunanimous. His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined with thegreatest care the evidence given before the Judicial Enquiry and otherexpressions of African opinion and are satisfied that the weight ofopinion among responsible Africans is against recognition, both forthe reasons set out above and because of the prejudice which they fearmight result to inter-raciai telations in Southern Africa.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore been led to their decision by the cumulative effect of a number of points, some of which, though derivedfrom a study of the evidence, have perhaps not been given adequate weightin the report. The reasons given by the Enquiry for their second conclusionare as follows:  &quot; (a) being a prohibited immigrant in the Union of South Africa, Seretsewill be unable to efficiently carry out his duties as Chief;(b) a friendly and co-operative Union of South Africa and SouthernRhodesia is essential to the well-being of the tribe, and indeed to thewhole of the Bechuanaland Protectorate;(c) his recognition will undoubtedly cause disruption in the Bamangwatotribe.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the first reason adduced in theReport cannot be accepted as a valid ground in itself; if it had been desirable
on other grounds to recognise Seretse as Chief, ways and&quot;, means&apos;could-andwould have been found to enable him to perform his duties, even though he should be unable to visit the headquarters of the Resident commissioner at Mafeking. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not of course dispute the validity of the second reason; but as they are satisfied that in other respectsthere are conclusive grounds for withholding recognition they have not found it necessary to examine the bearing of this consideration on the problembefore them.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government are conscious that the problem is oneof unusual difficulty and that a wrong decision, or even a right decisionmisunderstood and wrongly interpreted, may well have farreaching andincalculable consequences. They are well aware of the very strong feelingsthat can be aroused on the subject of mixed marriages, and they wish it to be clearly understood that they do not regard the issue in any way as oneof the merits or demerits of such marriages. The marriage assumed impor-tance in this case only because Seretse was in a special position as a prospective-tive Chief of an African tribe. What His Majesty&apos;s Government were required to decide was whether the interests of the tribe itself and of theother tribes in the High Commission Territories would best be served by the recognition of Seretse. &apos;14. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the recognition of Seretsewould undoubtedly cause disruption in the Bamangwato tribe and for thisreason and in the circumstances described above they have come to the con-elusion that it is not desirable to recognise Seretse as Chief. It will benecessary, if faction feeling is to be diminished, that for some time Seretseshould not be permitted to reside in the Protectorate. Tshekedi, whoseresidence in the Bamangwato Reserve would be an embarrassment atpresent, has announced his intention of going into voluntary exile in the neighbouring Bakwena Reserve and has already taken steps to carry thisout. His Regency has ceased and there is no question of his becomingChief. In the period that will now follow, His Majesty&apos;s Government willtake every opportunity that offers to give the present native administrationa more representative character.
ANNEXDespatch from the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the BechiianalandProtectorate and Swaziland to the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations(Despatch No: 307) High Commissioners Office,Sir, Pretoria, 6th December, 1949.I have the honour to forward copies of the Report of the recent judicial enquiry into questions relating to the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribein the Bechuanaland Protectorate.2.   As you will recall, the Enquiry&apos;s terms of reference were:  &quot; (I) To report whether the Kgotla held at Serowe between the 20th and 25lhJune, 1949, at which Seretse Khania was designated as Chief of the bamangwato Tribe, was properly convened and assembled, and its proceedings conducted in accordance with native custom;(2) to report on the question whether, having particular regard to theinterests and well-being of the tribe, Seretse Khama is a fit and properperson to discharge the functions of Chief.&quot;On these terms of reference the EnquiryVconclusions are:  &quot; (I) We are of the opinion that the Kgotla held at Serowe between the 20thand 25th June, 1949, at which Seretse Khama was designated as Chiefof the Bamangwato Tribe, was properly convened and assembled, andits proceedings conducted in accordance with native custom;(2) that having regard to the interests and well-being of the Tribe, SeretseKhama is not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of chief.&quot;3. The reasons leading to these conclusions are given at the end of chapter III of the Report and, in regard to the second conclusion, are brieflythat:(a) being a prohibited immigrant in the Union of South Africa, Seretsewould be unable efficiently to carry out his duties as Chief;(/;) a friendly and co-operative Union of South Africa and SouthernRhodesia is essential to the well-being of the Tribe and indeed the wholeof the Bechuanaland Protectorate;(c) Seretse&apos;s recognition  would  undoubtedly  cause  disruption in  the bamangwato Tribe.4. While not necessarily agreeing with all the comment in the report, I accept these conclusions and accordingly recommend, in terms of Section 3(1)of the Bechuanaland Protectorate Native Administration Proclamation, 1943,for your approval that Seretse Khama should not be recognised as Chief ofthe Bamangwato Tribe.5.   As the Enquiry points out, this decision will be unpopular with certain sections of the Tribe.6. Further, as the Enquiry also suggests in a very valuable Chapter IVregarding the handling of the resulting situation, it will be essential to ensurethat both the main parties to the dispute Seretse and Tshekedi Khama should leave the Bamangwato Reserve at least temporarily. The continuedpresence of either or both would lead to continuing dissension and make themaintenance of peace, order and good government extremely difficult if notimpracticable.   I should therefore like to take opportunity, when I reach
London next week, to discuss with you at length the findings of the Enquiry, myrecommendation that vSeretse Khama should not be recognised and the mannerin which the resulting situation should be handled. 1 have a number of proposals and suggestions to make, but would in the first instance prefer toraise them orally.7. In the meantime and pending our discussions, I propose that no action should be taken excepting to terminate the appointment of Chief tshekedi khama as Native Authority and to appoint in his place as Native authority the District Commissioner, Serowe, in terms of Section 17 (1) of the bechuanaland-land Protectorate Native Administration Proclamation, 1943, as amended bythe recent Native Administration (Amendment) Proclamation No. 43 of 1949.This change will be effected by notice in the official gazette appearing on the9th December.8.

REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL ENQUIRY RE SERETSE KHAMA,OF THE BAMANGWATO TRIBEAppointed by His Excellency the High  Commissioner byNotice No. 204 of 1949, of the 15th September, 1949REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL ENQUIRYappointed to enquire into the circumstances attending and matters arisingfrom the alleged designation of Seretse Khama as Chief of the bamangwato Tribe at a Kgotla held at Serowe, in the bechuanaland protectorate between the 20th June and the 25th June, 1949.To : His Excellency the High Commissioner for Basutoland&apos;, the bechuanaland-land Protectorate and Swaziland.May it Please Your Excellency:We, the undersigned, have the honour to submit the following report:  The appointment of the Judicial Enquiry, as contained in High Com-missioner&apos;s Notice No. 165 of 1949, dated the 29th July, 1949, reads asfollows:  ...... jf.&quot; It is hereby notified for general information that, in exercise of thepowers vested in him by section three,of the Bechuanaland ProtectorateNative Administration Proclamation, 1943 (No. 32 of 1943), His Excel-lency the High Commissioner has been pleased to direct that a judicial enquiry, presided over by Sir Walter Harragin, C.M.G., K.C., Judge ofthe High Court, be held to enquire into the circumstances attending and matters arising from the designation of Seretse Khama as Chief of the bamangwato Tribe at a Kgotla held at Serowe in the bechuanaland protectorate between the 20th and the 25th days of June, 1949.&quot;&quot; The terms of reference of the Enquiry and the names of thoseappointed to assist the Judge at the enquiry will be published at a later date.&quot;The names of the Members, and terms of reference, of the judicial enquiry were published in High Commissioners Notice No. 204, 1949,dated the 15th September, 1949:-&quot; It is hereby notified for general information that His excellency the High Commissioner has been pleased to appoint Mr. R. S. Hudson,C.M.G., and Mr. G. E. Nettelton, C.B.E., to be members of the judicial enquiry announced by High Commissioner^ Notice No. 165 of 1949,which is to be presided over by Sir Walter Harragin, C.M.G., K.C..Judge of the High Court. The terms of reference of the enquiryshall be:  (1) To report whether the Kgotla held at Serowe between the 20thand 25th June, 1949, at which Seretse Khama was designated as Chief of the Bamangwato tribe, was properly convened andassembled, and its proceedings conducted in accordance with nativecustom.(2) To report on the question whether, having particular regard tothe interests and well-being of the tribe, Seretse Khama is a fitand proper person to discharge the functions of Chief.&apos;&apos;
&quot; The enquiry will commence its hearings at Serowe in the bechuanaland-land Protectorate in the latter part of October. The exact date will be notified later by the Chairman by notice in the Gazette/&apos;  -Mr. F. G. Holmes, Assistant District Commissioner, Serowe, wasappointed Secretary.In a Public Notice, dated the 6th October, 1949, published in the Gazette,the date and the procedure to be adopted were fixed by the Chairman. TheEnquiry would commence its sittings at Serowe on the 1st November, 1949.The procedure adopted was, as far as was practicable, similar to theprocedure laid down for civil cases. Persons giving evidence were liableto be examined and cross-examined by interested parties, or their legalrepresentatives. Any person (other than a person called by one of the partiesto the enquiry) desiring to give evidence could communicate with the Secre-tary and a date was fixed for his evidence. Any person unable to attend the enquiry could submit written memoranda to the Secretary and these,when admitted as evidence, were read out at the Enquiry.For the purposes of clarity and convenience, Tshekedi Khama wasrgearded as Plaintiff, and Seretse Khama as Defendant.The events leading up to the present enquiry began with the marriageof Seretse Khama, heir to the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe, toRuth Williams, an English woman, in London, a little more than a year ago.A general history of the tribe and of Seretse Khama&apos;s marriage will befound in Chapter II but, to anticipate briefly, this enquiry was a resultof a meeting of the tribe in June 1949, at which Seretse Khama wasacclaimed Chief of the Bamangwato. At two previous meetings his Europeanwife had been found unacceptable. At this final meeting the tribe, by an overwhelming majority, demanded him as Chief, and accepted his wife.Tshekedi Khama, the Regent, voiced his protest at the decision of the tribeby removing to a neighbouring reserve, followed by some forty leadingtribal personalities, and and stated in a public declaration, which forms partof the record, that he found it impossible to accept Ruth Williams asQueen and mother of the tribe. Recognised tribal law and custom hadnot been observed, and the decision of the June meeting, if implemented,could only lead to the disruption of the tribe. He therefore requested the Government to hold a judicial enquiry to declare once and for all thefinal position of Ruth and her children. A report of the meeting, and thepublic declaration, were forwarded to the High Commissioner and to theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. Their decision was con-tained in High Commissioners Notice No. 165, which is quoted in thefirst paragraph of this report. This was read out by the Resident Com-missioner to the tribe assembled in Kgotla on the 30th June, 1949.During the last week-end of October, the members of the Judicial Enquiryarrived in Serowe, and on Tuesday, the 1st November, the Enquiry com-menced its sittings. The proceedings were held in a marquee erected near theoffice of the District Commissioner and were attended by a large and orderlycrowd of tribesmen.Mr. A. C. Thompson, M.C., K.C., Attorney-General of the High Com-mission Territories, was present, acting on instructions from the HighCommissioner, holding a watching brief for the Administration.Mr. P. A. Fraenkel represented Seretse Khama. Tshekedi Khama was neither present nor represented, but he had sent a petition, requesting theJudicial Enquiry to take the evidence of himself and his followers atLobatsi, the seat of the High Court of the Protectorate. After due con-sideration, the Chairman decided that the enquiry would remove to Lobatsito hear Tshekedi&apos;s evidence. As Mr. Fraenkel, on behalf of Seretse, wasnot prepared to produce his witnesses before he had heard those of Tshekedi,38170 c*
two independent witnesses, the Reverend Haile, of the London MissionarySociety, and Mr. Ellenbreger, First Assistant Secretary of the bechuanaland protectorate, were heard at Serowe that afternoon. The Enquiry thenadjourned to reassemble at the Court House in Lobatsi on the4th November.On the 4th November, Mr. Fraenkel, instructed by the tribe, asked per-mission of the Chairman to stand down during the proceedings at Lobatsi,as a protest against Tshekedi Khama&apos;s attitude in refusing to give evidenceat Serowe.   His request was granted.Tshekedi Khama, represented by Mr. D. M. Buchanan, K.C., then beganhis evidence. Ten witnesses were examined at Lobatsi, all of whom appearedfor Tshekedi, including an African witness from the Union of South Africa.The Enquiry finished its sittings at Lobatsi on the 10th November andreassembled at Serowe on the 14th November.Five witnesses appeared at Serowe on behalf of Seretse, including himself.Seven independent witnesses, including Mr. Ellenberger, who was recalled,and Mr. Sullivan, the District Commissioner of Serowe, also gave evidence.One African witness appeared to state the views of the Bamangwato whowere working at the mines on the Rand. The written memoranda wereread out by the Secretary. The evidence was finally closed on the18th November. Evidence was given in both Tswana and English andwas interpreted throughout the proceedings. A complete record of theevidence in English is submitted with this report.The report of the Enquiry was written at Pretoria.A complete list of all witnesses who appeared, the dates and places oftheir appearance, and on whose behalf, is given in Schedule A, and a list ofthe exhibits, and the witnesses who handed them in, is given in Schedule B.These Schedules appear at the beginning of the record of evidence. the written memoranda appear in the record of the proceedings. Certain letterswere disallowed by the Chairman as being offensive or irrelevant.CHAPTER IIThe Ba-Ngwato, as their name indicates, are the people of Chief Ngwato,whom they followed after internecine warfare amongst the Ba-Hurutshe, from whom the Betswana originated, some time in the 18th century. In the fashionof the Betswana of today, a dispute arose over the chieftainship, and Ngwato,with his followers, moved from what is now the Southern bechuanaland protectorate, leaving his brother, Kwena, in possession, in the vicinity ofwhat is now known as the Bakwena Reserve.Following a fight between the rival sections, Ngwato finally took up hisresidence with his adherents at Shoshong, in what is now known as the bamangwato Reserve.The history of the Betswana tribes consists of a succession of internaldisputes often arising out of the reluctance of the Regent to surrender histrust to the rightful heir at the appropriate time. For generations it is foundthat tribal life is upset at intervals by these disputes and, when there were no internal disagreements to engage the attention of the Chief and his men,the invaders (i.e., the Matabele, the Makololo of Sebitwane, &amp;c.) drove them from one place to another.It was Sekgoma, the father of Khama III, whose despotic rule brought together the scattered remnants of the people who are the present Bangwatotribe, with its great mixture of what are termed &quot; allied &quot; peoples, who came to them for protection from their enemies.Sekgoma was succeeded by his son, Khama III, who is regarded as oneof the great African rulers and who is the grandfather of Seretse, the subjectof this enquiry.
Khama III was born about 1827-28, dying in 1923 at Serowe after a rule of just over fifty years.The reign of Khama III followed the same pattern as those of his predecessors-successors. Khama III had himself been deeply suspected by his father,Sekgoma I, from whom he received drastic treatment and he, in turn, found himself in violent conflict with his son, Sekgoma II.Sekgoma II finally left his father in 1899 with a considerable following ofmen, who found in him a more generous and less severe chief. This estrange-ment between father and son was a serious one, which lasted until 1916,when in his declining years Khama received his son back into the tribe.Sekgoma II had four wives, the last one, Tebogo, daughter of Kebailele,bearing him two sons, of whom the younger died in infancy, leaving Seretse,who was born on the 1st July, 1921, as his heir.It is well at this stage to give a brief picture of the achievements ofKhama III. He was a fanatic on the subject of drink of any kind, not onlythe white man&apos;s strong drink, but even the milder native beer brewed fromSorghum (kaffir corn). To this day there are many Bangwato who are totalabstainers.In 1896 Khama, accompanied by Chiefs Bathoen of the Bangwaketse,and Sebele of the Bakwena, visited England and had an interview withMr. Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for the Colonies. A plea was madeby the Chiefs for the preservation to them of their land and of their rights, andit was requested, among other things, that strong drink should not be sold intheir respective countries to either white people or black people. These Chiefshad seen the ruination following the sale to their people of brandy and winesby concession hunters and traders.One of the results of this visit was that the present Bamangwato Reserve,which is shewn on the accompanying map, was created by ProclamationNo. 9 of 1899. Certain portions of Crown Land have since been added by proclamation No. 31 of 1933. Its area is approximately 40,000 square milesand its African population, according to a census taken in 1946, is 100,000.A striking feature arising out of population statistics is that there are only some 18,000 Bangwato proper, the remaining number of 82,000 being subjector &quot; allied &quot; peoples of whom the principal, numerically, are : Makalaka          .................. 24,000Mabirwa..................... 6,500Makgalagadi      .................. 6,000Batalaote..................... 4,000Matswapong (A mixture of small groups)     ...... 13,000They are pastoral people and own large herds of cattle, totalling about300,000 head. There are 500 Europeans and 150 Coloured persons in theReserve and no Asiatics.It is this inheritance which Seretse now seeks and which it is allegedTshekedi covets for himself.On the death of Khama in 1923, Sekgoma became Chief, but he wasdestined to rule for little more than two years, during the course of whichthe inevitable internal disputes were prominent, and Sekgoma died in 1925,leaving as his heir his infant son, Seretse.The rule of the tribe was carried on for a time by means of a Council ofRegency but in 1926 it was found more suitable to install as Regent, Tshekedi,the son of Khama and half-brother of Sekgoma. At this time, Seretse was at Serowe at the home of his mother, who died in 1930, leaving the full responsibility for him in the hands of Tshekedi.In due course, Seretse was sent away to school, attending in turn TigerKloof, Lovedale, Adams College and Fort Hare. He came of age and normally.38170 c* 2
should have taken up his position as Chief but instead came the fatefuldecision to send him to the United Kingdom to study law. Seretse himselfexpressed a desire to continue his education at Oxford. He had passed the examination for his Bachelor of Arts degree at Fort Hare and should havebeen well enough equipped to cope with the responsibilities of his position.It would seem, however, that the Bangwato wished their Chief to become a sufficiently learned person in law to be able to hold his own against all. So,in 1945, Seretse left South Africa for England and Tshekedi remained to carryon the Regency, with the full support and confidence of the Bangwato, for what gave the appearance of being an indefinite period.Seretse began his overseas academic career at Balliol College, Oxford,eventually finding his way to London, where he carried on his legal studies,achieving the first part of the Bar examination.The Government of the Bechuanaland Protectorate played no part in thearrangements for the advancement of Seretse&apos;s overseas studies.On the 20th September, 1948, an air mail letter came from Seretse to hisuncle and guardian, Tshekedi, saying that he proposed to marry an Englishgirl and that he feared his uncle and the tribe&quot; would not approve of his pro-posed action. He announced his marriage day as the 2nd October. such steps as were possible were taken by Tshekedi to prevent or delay the marriage,but Seretse merely advanced his wedding day to the 24th September, and finally on the 29th September, in the face of all opposition, married RuthWilliams, an English girl living in London.Seretse was summoned to Serowe to give an account of himself, arrivingby air on the 22nd October, 1948, after an assurance that he would be per-mitted to return to his wife in England.On the 26th October, a meeting of welcome was held at Serowe and, on itstermination, the people were invited to discuss any matters they wished withSeretse informally. It was hoped that many persons would use their endeavours to persuade Seretse to give up his European wife. Various meetings of mem-bers of the Royal house were held, but Seretse remained unshakable in hisdetermination to retain his wife.On the 15th November, a large meeting of the tribe was held, lasting untilthe 19th November, at which Seretse was taken to task by the tribe for hisbreach of tribal custom. Prior to the meeting, he had been given the oppor-tunity of freely discussing his affairs with whomsoever he wished. Strangelyenough, he did not attend at the Kgotla in the customary fashion, but insteadseems to have attached himself to the persons who are now his ardent sup-porters. At this stage the relations between guardian and ward were not entirely lacking in cordiality, for Tshekedi still hoped to wean Seretse fromhis white wife.The tribe at this first meeting, with almost one voice, condemned the marriage and resolved that all steps should be taken to prevent Seretse&apos;s whitewife from entering the Bamangwato Reserve. It was still, however, left opento Seretse to return to England in terms of the undertaking given him. Itis shown that the tribe hoped for the aid of the British Government indestroying the marriage, or at least in preventing Seretse&apos;s white wife fromcorning to the Bamangwato Reserve. Doubts began to arise and it waswhispered that Tshekedi had grasped what to him seemed the opportunity for keeping the chieftainship for himself. People began to say, &quot; He talks of the chieftainship, not of the white wife.&quot; It would seem that support for Seretsewas slowly growing in the tribe, not so much out of the desire for Seretse andhis white wife, but as a means of ridding themselves of Tshekedi. Tshekediaffirmed, and continues to affirm, that the right of succession of Seretse isindisputable.
Sefetse had been left by the tribe after the first Kgotla meeting in november to think things over, but it is clear that in the course of this space of timehere was no change in Seretse&apos;s attitude, i.e., he would keep his white wifeor leave the country for ever. On the 27th to the 29th December, the secondKgotla meeting was called by Tshekedi, being attended by the Deputy resident commissioner as a Government observer. It is recorded that there was a significant strengthening of support for Seretse. Seretse remained adamantand a certain amount of alarm arose amongst the tribesmen lest Seretse shouldbe lost for ever and Tshekedi should become their Chief in his own right.Feeling was perhaps best illustrated by an elderly headman who said inSetswana, &quot; I thoroughly disapprove of the marriage-it is a bad thing butI see what it all means. You want to destroy the marriage, which will requiremoney that means another levy.  Let the wife come, let the wife come.&quot;At the November meeting, seven people had spoken in favour of the marriage and many against it. On the 27th to 29th December, at the secondKgotla meeting, the figures showed a significant increase in those in supportof the marriage. The meeting was an indecisive one and, after a short dis-cussion with the Deputy Resident Commissioner, Seretse willingly agreed tothe suggestion that he should return to England and endeavour to completehis law examinations. This decision was conveyed to the Tribe which insisted on a guarantee that Seretse would not be prevented from returning and, inhis farewell address, he told the people he would return in June.The people dispersed and all remained quiet for the time being.It was conveyed to Tshekedi in March that the Government was not pre-pared to take any step to prevent Seretse&apos;s wife from entering the bechuanaland protectorate.Seretse arrived in Mafeking, unannounced, on the 8th June. It wouldappear that on his return his attitude was one of reiteration of his formerstatement, that he would in no circumstances give up his wife and that hehad come to ascertain finally whether or not the Tribe wanted him and tomake it clear that in this they would have to bear in mind that, in acceptinghim, they would also have to accept his wife.On the 20th June, 1949, and on the following days, the third Kgotla meet-ing was held at Serowe, being attended, as Government observer, byMr. V. F. Ellenberger, T.S.O., Acting Government Secretary.The suspicion that Tshekedi sought to wrest the chieftainship fromSeretse had steadily grown and the vast majority of the Tride, realising thatany hope they formerly had that the Government would destroy the marriageor keep Seretse&apos;s wife out of the territory had vanished, were prepared to acceptSerefse under any conditions. Furthermore, they realised that even if Seretse&apos;swife were kept out, he would return to her and be lost to them.The result of the meeting was a popular demonstration in favour of Seretse.Events had taken a most unexpected turn and Tshekedi found his authorityliterally overthrown by the Tribe.Following this. Tshekedi announced his intention of leaving the reserve and he made a public declaration to this effect, which is embodied in the record of evidence. Further, he asked the High Commissioner to hold a judicialenauiry to declare once and for all the final position as regards Seretse&apos;s wife and her children.The High Commissioner appointed this Commission with the terms ofreference as set out in Chapter I of this Report.Tshekedi, with some forty-five supporters, began to take active steps for moving from the Bamangwato Reserve.Seretse&apos;s wife arrived at Serowe on the 20th August, 1949.At the end of October, the Government of the Union of South Africadeclared both Seretse and his wife prohibited immigrants. The Government of
Southern Rhodesia announced that it would take such steps as it considered necessary, should the occasion arise.-The events following the meeting in June are not of great significance, but the opposition to Tshekedi grew daily and at the commencement of the hearing of this enquiry he had virtually lost control of the tribe, though still nominallyRegent. He spent most of his time at his new home at Rametsana, in theBakwena Reserve.CHAPTER IIIIn order to appreciate the problem that faced the Enquiry, it is of interestto consider the characters of the two contesting parties. We have already described the education given to Seretse, and it must be realised that his out-look on life is very different from that of the vast majority of his Tribe andall his so-called uncles, of whom he appears to have a large number.It would be incorrect to think of him as an African well satisfied with amud and wattle hut, and with crude sanitary conveniences. Though a typicalAfrican in build and features, he has assimilated, to a great extent, the mannersand thoughts of an Oxford undergraduate. He speaks English well and is obviously quick to appreciate, even if he may not agree with, the Europeanpoint of view. Thus he was an easy witness to examine, he immediately under-stood the questions and answered them without hesitation, clearly and fairly,and we have no hesitation in finding that, but for his unfortunate marriage,his prospects of success as a Chief are as bright as those of any Native in africa with whom we have come in contact, provided that he shows himself to be as good a judge in the choice of his advisers as he is in other matters,and that his industry and tact prove to be of as high an order as his educationalqualifications.His uncle and opponent is a man of very different character and outlook.Appointed Regent at the early age of 20, without the educational advantages that he has given to his nephew, he has driven his people hard for a periodof 23 years. He is a dynamic character, shrewd, strong-minded and suspicious,and we should imagine intolerant of opposition. He appeared to regard everyquestion asked him by the members of the Commission as a carefully thoughtout trap and took every precaution to avoid falling into it, even where the answers were obvious and simple. Thus, as a witness, he comparedunfavourably with his nephew. We are not, however, unaware of the difficultyears through which he has guided his people with great skill and determina-tion, a people brought up on dissension and intrigue, as is so clearly shown intheir history. Seretse must have known that he was taking on a doughtyopponent when he crossed swords with this uncle of his, who had been afather to him in every way from a very early age until his marriage.The High Commissioner, in directing this enquiry to be held, has invoked. his powers under Section 3 of the Bechuanaland Native Administration proclamation-mation 1943 (32/43) but nowhere in the Proclamation is there any indication of the procedure to be adopted at an enquiry, save in the interpretation section,which reads as follows: &quot; Judicial enquiry means an enquiry conducted according to the rules of evidence, and at which any party interested shall have the light to appear and to be legally represented.&quot;It was not, therefore, surprising that neither Tshekedi nor Seretse were certain as to the order and manner in which the evidence would be elicitedfrom the witnesses at the enquiry. The Secretary was, therefore, directed toinform interested parties that the procedure that would be adopted at the
enquiry would follow, as far as possible, that of a civil case, save that theChairman would commence the proceedings by calling one or two witnesses togive a short resume of the history of the Bamangwato tribe, and put in the family tree of Khama. This evidence was to be followed by that of tshekedi and his witnesses, as if he were the plaintiff in a civil action, followed bySeretse and his witnesses as the defendant.The suggestion that he was to be regarded as plaintiff elicited a formal protest from Tshekedi, but in the event it turned out to be a satisfactory method of obtaining the evidence. It might be added here that, at the con-clusion of the evidence of interested parties, the Chairman called two membersof the administration to give factual evidence as to the state of affairs in the tribe at the present day, while certain written evidence, which had been posted to the Secretary, was read coram publico, and copies were given to interested parties on application.On arriving at Serowe, we received a petition from Tshekedi, requesting that the enquiry be transferred to Lobatsi, a distance of 250 miles, as he feared that his life would be in danger if he gave evidence in Serowe. This applicationdid not come as a surprise to us, as a similar appeal had been made to theHigh Commissioner when the notice fixing the hearing at Serowe had been published, but it was none the less embarrassing, as this enquiry withoutTshekedi might well be compared with Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.Whether there was any substance in the fears of Tshekedi and his legal adviser it was impossible to judge, as at that time we had had no oppor-tunity of assessing the temper of the 5,000 people who had assembled to hear the proceedings. We therefore decided to take no risk and, at great incon-venience to ourselves and everyone else, we adjourned the enquiry toLobatsi and there took the evidence of Tshekedi and his witnesses, returning to Serowe as soon as their evidence was concluded.In the light of our subsequent experience, we are satisfied that this movewas probably unnecessary, for the behaviour of the crowd in Serowe wasorderly and restrained throughout but, as we have said above, it was essentialthat Tshekedi should give his evidence and we were not prepared to riskan incident of which we had been warned, even if we could have persuadedTshekedi to give evidence in Serowe.Our decision to adjourn to Lobatsi was very unpopular with Seretse andhis followers, who pointed out, with reason, that the matter was essentially the concern of the Bamangwato people, that their administrative centre wasSerowe, that they had collected from all over the Reserve to hear theEnquiry and give evidence, that Lobatsi was outside the Reserve, and thatTshekedi had been moving freely in the Reserve up to a few days beforethe Enquiry started. They then proceeded to hold a meeting, at whichthey, in turn, decided to take no part in the proceedings at Lobatsi, except to direct their legal adviser to attend and hold a watching brief. Thisdecision was regrettable from our point of view, as it permitted Tshekedito give his evidence without fear of cross:examination and obliged the attorney-General and ourselves at times to appear in the light of cross-examiners whenever any matter within our knowledge required clarifica-tion, while it was a tactical error on the part of Seretse and his supporters,as Tshekedi and his witnesses could have been vigorously cross-examined in Lobatsi without fear of retaliation in Serowe.Tshekedi gave his evidence at great length and with the aid of care-fully prepared documents, but he regarded any questions by the Attorney-General or by ourselves with grave suspicion, thus his answers were usuallymore verbose and involved than the simplicity of the question appeared to demand. This attitude of mind tended to prolong proceedings, as can be shown in one very simple example.   For hours Tshekedi impugned the
10validity of the decision of the June Kgotla to accept Seretse as Chief andRuth as Queen, but in the last few minutes of his evidence he volunteeredthe fact that the tribe at a Kgotla in 1925 had designated Seretse as Chief,so that It was a matter of no practical importance whether they reiteratedtheir decision in June 1949 or not. Tshekedi has, however, given some very definite and clear evidence as to Seretse&apos;s misconduct with regard to nativelaw and custom, and it might be convenient at this point to set out seriatimthe various allegations which, if proved, would in Tshekedi&apos;s submissionunfit Seretse to hold the position of Chief.   That:-(a) Seretse, having married without obtaining the consent of the Chief andelders of the Chiefs family, his wife could never under any circum-stances become Queen of the tribe.(6) The children of Ruth could never succeed to the chieftainship under any circumstances.(c) Seretse, by ignoring native law and custom in this matter, has shownhimself as irresponsible and therefore unfit to be a Chief.(d) Seretse, by refusing to accept the decision of the November Kgotlaand by pretending that the question before the Kgotla last June wasa question of chieftainship and not one of irregular marriage,stampeded the tribe into an improper decision.  .(e) According to native law and custom, no proposition could be placed before the Kgotla save by the Chief or Chairman of the Kgotla, andthat therefore the question put before the June Kgotla by Seretse wasimproperly and irregularly voted upon.(/) In any event, voting at a Kgotla is contrary to native law andcustom, as only the Chief or Chairman at a Kgotla can give thedecision of a Kgotla.(g) Seretse, by drinking intoxicating liquor contrary to native law andcustom, and in particular to Bamangwato custom, had barred him-self from the chieftainship.(h) Seretse had been levying or inspiring illegal levies and was thereforeliable to prosecution, which should disqualify him for the chief-tainship.(0 Seretse, during the period that he was in England from January toMay 1949 was conspiring through his agents to deceive the peopleinto believing that the issue for the June Kgotla was one of the chieftainship and not the unsuitability of his marriage.(/&apos;) The recognition by the High Commissioner of Seretse as Chief will cause disruption in the tribe.(k) The recognition by the High Commissioner of Seretse as Chief willendanger the friendly relations of the Bamangwato with the Union ofSouth Africa and Southern Rhodesia, upon whose good offices the tribe is greatly dependent.(0 The fact that the Union of South Africa had declared Seretse a pro-hibited immigrant makes it impossible for him to carry out his duties as Chief.(m)The statutory laws of the Protectorate do not envisage a Europeanas a member of a tribe.We will now deal seriatim with these charges.(a) and (b). There can be no question but that Seretse has in fact marriedwithout obtaining the consent of his uncle, Tshekedi, who was the Chief(Regent) of the tribe, nor did he place the matter before any of the otherelders of the tribe. Before his marriage he informed Tshekedi of his inten-tions and Tshekedi made every effort, official and unofficial, to preventSeretse carying out his desire, which in the opinion of Tshekedi was a fatal
mistake from every point of view. The only result, however, of the efforts made in England to prevent this marriage was to provoke Seretse intomarrying at a Registry Office, at a date earlier than he had originally intended.Tshekedi&apos;s immediate reaction to the news of the marriage was to haveSeretse summoned back to Bechuanaland, where in due course his conductwas discussed in the November Kgotla, with the result indicated in the lastchapter. The tribe were shocked by the marriage and the lack of respectknown by the Chief designate for native law and custom, and theyclearly indicated that, in their view, Seretse should get rid of his wife.How exactly this was to be done does not seem to have been consideredvery carefully, and it would appear to have been assumed that the disapprovalof the tribe would have been accepted as good cause for a divorce inEngland. At the end of the November Kgotla it was apparently decided tohold a further Kgotla in December. Why this was necessary is not very clear, but it seems to have been thought by Tshekedi and others that thematter might by that time have been settled for them by a kindly Govern-ment, who would have declared Ruth Seretse a prohibited immigrant andhave refused to permit Seretse to leave Bechuanaland to join her in England,and they hoped that in this way Seretse&apos;s interest in his European wife would disappear and matters would right themselves eventually, by perhaps adivorce on the grounds of desertion.In the meanwhile, local pressure was being brought to bear on Seretseby the senior members of the tribe to make him see the error of his ways,but time passed, and Seretse, still to his credit, refused to contemplate divorce,and when the December Kgotla assembled public opinion was beginning towaver.The real pattern of future events was becoming more clear; Seretseobviously had no intention of giving up his wife, even if it meant surrenderingthe chieftainship, and the Government had no intention of preventing theyoung couple coming together again, and we think that a fair interpreta-tion of the feelings of the December Kgotla was that Seretse should returnto England to his wife and there continue his legal studies, but that heshould report back in six months&apos; time, when they hoped that he wouldhave got over the first blush of his infatuation. The majority of the Kgotlastill made it clear that they did not approve of the marriage, and we do notthink that the question of the chieftainship was seriously discussed. In May.Seretse duly returned as promised, leaving his wife in London, and the resultof the June meeting is recorded in the last Chapter. The first question thenfor consideration is whether there is any substance in TshekedFs contention thatRuth Seretse could never become Queen of the tribe, which includes, of course,(b), Tshekedi&apos;s second contention that her children could never succeed to the chieftainship. A great deal of evidence was given upon this point and it mustbe realised that this is not a question of white versus black, but a straightissue as to whether, under any circumstances, a Chief or an heir apparent,who marries without permission of his tribe, could ever have his wife recog-nised as Queen. We have no hesitation in finding that this is, and alwayswas, a possibility, and that Seretse&apos;s answer to this contention is the correctone, and it amounts to this; a Chief, even though he acts without the consentof the tribe, can subsequently obtain their forgiveness and ratification of his action, in which event the woman whom he has married will be recognised bythe tribe as Queen and her children as lawful successors to the chieftainship.We are well aware that in the old days this matter would have been settledquite simply by the tribe in November either killing Seretse or driving him intoexile. In fact, as the history of the Bamangwato shows, most chiefs seem tohave spent years in exile for some misdemeanour, but if and when they returned
and were accepted by the tribe, if their wife was also accepted, there is hodoubt that their children were looked upon as the lawful heirs. In these days,Seretse has won the battle for himself and his wife, not by force of arms, butby force of votes.We would, however, point out that our terms of reference do not envisagea decision on this issue, nor is such a question contemplated by the particularproclamation under which we were appointed, and we only touch on the pointbecause much emphasis was laid upon it by Tshekedi. We agree with Seretsethat it is for the tribe, and not for the Government, to decide who is to berecognised as Queen of the tribe. It should be realised that the word &quot; Queen &quot;is quite inappropriate for the wife of a Chief, and has no justification in tribalhistory, where she would be referred to as the principal wife, it being pre-sumed that the Chief would have several wives.(c) We have already indicated, and Seretse does not dispute the fact, thathe ignored native law and custom over his marriage, the only question now for consideration is whether his conduct is such a serious breach of native lawthat he has unfitted himself for the position of Chief.His defence on this charge is exactly the same as that put forward withregard to (a) and (b). He admits ignoring native custom, but alleges that the tribe has forgiven him and that the matter is therefore closed, and he further points out that chiefs on many occasions in the past have ignored native custom,but that, provided they received forgiveness from the tribe, nothing further washeard of the matter.With this contention we entirely agree; in our view, the matter is one forthe tribesmen and for them alone, and if they are prepared to forgive a chiefwho has ignored their custom, who are we to insist on his punishment?(d) It is true that Seretse did not accept the decision of the first Kgotlaheld in November 1948, but it must be remembered that it was Tshekedi him-self who summoned the subsequent Kgotlas, so that even he could not have considered that a final and irrevocable decision had been made in November,and the fact that the third Kgotla in June reversed the decision of the firstKgotla in November is, in our view, sufficient answer to this criticism; it isidle to pretend that any assembly is bound irrevocably by its previous decision.We cannot agree that Seretse stampeded the tribe in the third Kgotla inJune. Undoubtedly, the main issue that Tshekedi wished to put before the tribe was the marriage, and what was to happen as a result of the marriage,and we accept Tshekedi&apos;s statement that he had never claimed the chieftainship of right or raised that issue, but in practice the chieftainship did in factdepend on the decision to be taken by the Kgotla. Seretse had declared fromthe outset that if the tribe would not accept his wife he would not remain inthe Protectorate without her, a fortiori, he could not become their chief, sothat, if the tribe had reaffirmed their decision that they would not acceptRuth Seretse, it would have meant that Seretse could not be their chief, andwe consider that it was a perfectly relevant question that Seretse put to the kgotla when he asked them whether they would accept him and his wife. Weare also satisfied that the tribe, when they voted in favour of Seretse, knewexactly what they were doing and why they were doing it, and we are of theopinion that so unpopular had Tshekedi become with the tribe that they looked upon Seretse as their only hope of deliverance from their unpopular Regent,and they would have accepted Seretse under almost any circumstances andwhether he had broken any or all the native customs connected with the marriage.(e) In theory, there is no doubt about Tshekedfs contention that only thechief or chairman of a Kgotla may put the Question to the Kgotla, and it was certainly irregular for Seretse to have jumped up and put the question himself.It must, however, be remembered that this Kgotla was the third that had been
held to discuss the same subject, it had already lasted several days withoutany result, and Tshekedi does not appear to have been anxious to put thequestion himself, presumably because he knew from the speakers that hiscause was lost and he was playing for time. Further, Tshekedi, as Chairmanof the meeting, made no attempt to prevent the question being put and weare satisfied that, irregular though the proceedings may have been, the resultreflects truthfully the feeling of the meeting. It should here be noted thatTshekedi himself admits that no useful purpose would be served by a findingto the effect that the Kgotla, having been irregularly conducted, was a nullity.The only effect of such a recommendation would be that another Kgotlawould have to be summoned, which would have the same result.(/) Tshekedi in this allegation, which is to the effect that voting at aKgotla is unknown and contrary to native law and custom, is relying on a meretechnicality. We agree with him that in the olden days voting was unheard ofand that all that happened at a Kgotla was that the Chief, having put thequestion before the people, listened to the speakers and, having heard allthat they had to say, he himself announced the decision without any formalvote being taken; but it would have been a foolhardy chief who formallyannounced a decision which was contrary to the feelings of the meeting, andthere is no doubt that the majority would have dealt with him, if the matter had been of importance, in no uncertain manner. In recent days, however,evidence was given, which we accept, to the effect that, although actual votingmay not have taken place at Kgotla meetings, it is not unknown for the various parties at a Kgotla to collect in groups, from which the Chairman would judge of their strength. We are therefore of the opinion that there is no real sub-stance in this complaint.At this point we would like to quote from the words of Sir Herbert Stanley,the then High Commissioner, in his memorandum dealing with the 1934 NativeAdministration Proclamation, as we feel that they are even more true todaythan they were when they were written.&quot;In the affairs of men, nothing can remain stationary.  As the years pass,conditions change, and institutions and forms of Government which do notadapt themselves to changing conditions, and progress with them, lose their vitality and sink into decay.   Bechuanas are no longer the very. primitive people that they were some 40 years ago. Contact with Europeancivilization and the gradual spread of education have affected them appreci-ably, though in varying degrees. Many of their thoughts and ways of life,and systems and methods which may have sufficed 40 years ago, must,if they are to survive at all, be brought into line with the changed con-ditions, and must be rendered capable of further development in con-formity with such further changes as the future may bring forth.&quot;(g) The custom of the Bamangwato, as very definitely laid down by Khama,is to the effect that intoxicating liquor is forbidden.   Seretse admits that he does in fact, from time to time, drink intoxicating liquor and to that extent isdeparting from custom.  There is no suggestion that he drinks to excess andthere is no doubt that there are many other Natives in the Reserve, and in the protectorate generally, who do indulge in intoxicating liquor, wrong though itmay be, and we are not prepared to find that Seretse is thereby unfit for the chieftainship.(/z) Tshekedi alleged that Seretse had been levying or inspiring illegallevies, but there was no evidence to support this accusation and, although it was evident that Seretse had been obtaining considerable sums of money fromsomewhere, we can see no objection to his friends voluntarily supporting him inhis fight for what they believe to be his rights.(/) The allegation that between January and May 1949 Seretse, through his agents, deceived the people as to the real issue at the June Kgotla, we
have already touched upon, and not only do we find that there was nodeception as to the real issue at the June Kgotla but we can find no evidencethat Seretse was in any way disseminating false propaganda, as alleged.The change of heart that took place between December and June, as we havealready stated, was due entirely to the realisation by the people that if theydid not accept Seretse with his wife the rule of Tshekedi would continue.(/) The recognition by the High Commissioner of Seretse as Chief would,of course, cause a certain amount of disruption in the tribe. Tshekedi andhis followers have announced that, should Seretse&apos;s wife remain in the bamangwato Reserve, they will depart elsewhere. Tshekedi&apos;s followers arenot numerous but they are influential, they are probably the most experiencedadministrators in the tribe, possibly because they have been given administra-tive duties by Tshekedi in the past. Tshekedi himself is one of the mostenlightened and experienced native administrators in Africa, and theoreticallyhe himself should be a great loss, but the fact is that, so far as theBamanswato tribe is concerned, he has outstayed his welcome and, in spiteof all his good work, he is at present the most unpopular man in the tribe.It is. therefore, both in his own interest and in the interests of law andorder, that he should pursue his resolve and remove himself from theReserve.Against his followers there appears to be little real animosity, and theirwise counsel will be missed, even though Seretse is quite satisfied that thosewho remain will be well able to carry on the administrative duties, par-ticularly as, he points out, the actual number leaving the Reserve is smalland in due course may be expected to drift back.We must find, however, as a fact that Seretse&apos;s recognition as Chief would cause a rift in the tribe, in any event to begin with, and if Seretse&apos;s declaredintention to regard his uncle, Serogola, as his principal adviser is carriedout, we certainly are of the opinion that the tribe would suffer. We had theadvantage of hearing and seeing Serogola in the witness box and we cannotregard him in any way as a suitable adviser to a young chief.(k) Tshekedfs next point is indeed a most serious one; he alleges thatthe recognition by the High Commissioner of Seretse as Chief would en-danger the friendly relations of the Bechuanaland Protectorate with theUnion of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. We are aware of the attitude that has been taken up by the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia,for we have read the utterances of the Prime Minister of the Union and the debates in the Southern Rhodesian Parliament, and we are also aware of how dependent the Bechuanaland Protectorate is upon the good offices of theUnion and Southern Rhodesia. It is only necessary for us to mention theassociation with the Union and Southern Rhodesia in such matters ascustoms, the railway, the posts and telegraphs, currency, and the assistance given by the Union in veterinary and medical matters. There is no needfor us to expand or explain the facilities and services rendered by the Union(and to a lesser degree by Southern Rhodesia) they are self-evident.We have also noted the statement made by the Under-Secretary for Com-commonwealth Relations in the British Parliament in answer to a question put to him by Mr. Platts-Mills, which reads as follows:  &quot; Could you give a solemn assurance that the attitude of the Govern-ment will be in no way prejudiced by the fact that Seretse Khama marrieda white woman? Will you convey that attitude to the Government ofSouth Africa, which has looked with greedy and race-ridden eyes on this problem.&quot;to which the following reply was given:  &quot; T do not think there is any need to give such an assurance. TheGovernment of South Africa does not come into this matter at all.&quot;
We are aware that, in theory, this may be a perfectly correct answer tothe question but we also know in what straits the Bamangwato Reserve andBechuanaland would be if, for some reason, the Union of South Africaceased to co-operate, if only to the extent of finding it impossible to supplyBechuanaland with maize during famine months. There are, of course,innumerable other ways in which the Union and Southern Rhodesia could make themselves felt in the Protectorate if they ceased to be friendly, eventhough they might not resort to such drastic action as economic sanctions.The attitude of the vast majority of the European population and many ofthe Africans in the Union and Southern Rhodesia to this marriage cannotbe ignored, and, in spite of the Under-Secretary of State&apos;s reply, we haveno hesitation in saying that in practice an unfriendly policy in the union or Southern Rhodesia would have devastating effects on the bechuanaland protectorate.(/) And further in this connection it must be remembered that the headquarters of the Bechuanaland Protectorate are in Mafeking, which is inthe Union, and the Union Government has declared Seretse to be a pro-hibited immigrant. The immediate result of this declaration is that, ifSeretse were recognised as Chief of the Bamangwato Tribe, the official repre-sentative of the tribe (representing almost half the Bechuanaland protectorate and at least 100,000 people) would be debarred from visiting headquarters.We are quite unable to believe that, under those circumstances, Seretsewould be able to carry out his duties as Chief. It is calculated that in thepast the Chief has found it necessary to visit the Resident Commissioneronce every six weeks, ignoring for the moment the occasions upon which ithas been necessary for him to visit the High Commissioner, while allmeetings of importance are held in Mafeking, e.g., the African AdvisoryCouncil, and from all these Seretse will be debarred.When we put these difficulties to Seretse, his only reply was to suggest thatthe meetings should be held on the border which is about 15 miles fromMafeking, a quite impracticable suggestion. We realise that it is unfortunate that the official headquarters of the Protectorate he in a neighbouring terri-tory, but it is a fact that has got to be faced, and we are quite unable tothink of any practical way in which the difficulty could be overcome, short of moving the headquarters into the Protectorate which, apart from anyother difficulties, might well cost  1,000,000 and take a very long time.In all these circumstances we are bound to find that it would beimpossible for Seretse Khama to carry out his duties as Chief.(m) The last point made by Tshekedi with regard to the statutory laws of the Protectorate, which do not envisage a European as a member of atribe, has of course some substance; as for example the fact that Seretse&apos;swife would in the normal way be able to obtain a permit for intoxicatingliquor but she would be committing an offence if she gave any of it toher husband is true, but we do not consider this to be an insuperableobstacle to Seretse&apos;s recognition, for it is always possible to amend thestatutory laws to meet hard cases.In the course of the enquiry, two legal points were raised, one on behalfof Tshekedi and the other on behalf of Seretse. Counsel for Tshekedisubmitted a memorandum in which he argued that, although Seretse mighthave been legally married in England, for certain purposes his marriagewas invalid in the Protectorate. We do not consider an enquiry of thisdescription a proper place in which to record judgment on a point of law.We will observe, however, that, if in fact Ruth Williams is not marriedto Seretse for certain purposes when in the Protectorate, it is strange thatTshekedi should take such violent exception to his nephew living in sinwith a woman, a practice by no means unknown according to native law
and custom in the Protectorate. In any event, we are assured by our Chair-man that there is no substance in the legal point raised.Counsel for Seretse took, in our view, an equally ingenious point, whichwe find it difficult to believe he wished us to consider seriously. He argued that, because in 1925 a Kgotla had designated Seretse as Chief and as in1930 the Secretary of State, in conversation, referred to Seretse as &quot; ChiefSeretse,&quot; therefore he had been confirmed as Chief and came within the purview of Section 2 of Proclamation No. 32 of 1943, which reads asfollows : &quot; Every Chief, who at the commencement of this Proclamation islawfully holding the office of Chief, shall be deemed to have been recognised by the High Commissioner, and confirmed by the Secretaryof State.&quot;Seretse&apos;s legal representative argues that, as Seretse was designated Chief in1925 and accepted as Chief in 1930 by the Secretary of State, he was auto-ma tically confirmed in his office by the 1943 Proclamation. Our only comment on this is to say that, because the Secretary of State refers to someone as a chief in the course of conversation, this cannot be regarded as a formal recog-nition of his position, and moreover the words used in this section are, &quot; hold-ing the office of Chief &quot; and it can hardly be argued that Seretse was holdingthe office of Chief when pursuing his studies at Fort Hare, Witwatersrand orOxford University.Our conclusions on the questions referred to us in the terms of referencecan therefore be recorded as follows: 1. We are of the opinion that the Kgotla held at Serowe between the 20thand 25th June, 1949, at which Seretse Khama was designated as Chiefof the Bamangwato Tribe, was properly convened and assembled, andits proceedings conducted in accordance with native custom.2. That having regard to the interests and well-being of the Tribe, SeretseKhama is not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of Chief.Both these findings are subject to the comments which we have madeearlier, when dealing seriatim with the charges. Thus, although there may havebeen technical irregularities in accordance with native custom in the proceed-ings of the above-mentioned Kgotla, we are satisfied that it did record faith-fully and correctly the feelings of the Tribe, which are even stronger todaythan they were on the date of the Kgotla, and no useful purpose would be served in recommending the assembling of another Kgotla, which would onlyrecord the same decision even more emphatically.In finding that Seretse Khama is not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of Chief, we wish to emphasise the fact that, should conditionschange, as they well might in a variety of ways, Seretse Khama should beallowed to assume his duties as Chief. He is admittedly the lawful and legiti-mate heir and, save for his irresponsibility in contracting this unfortunatemarriage, would be, in our opinion, a fit and proper person to assume the chieftainship.We realise that our finding with regard to Seretse will be unpopular withthe Bamangwato Tribe, who are very loyal to*the reigning house, and we wishto make it clear to them that we are not disinheriting the house of Sekgomaforever, and it may well be that the time is not far distant when SeretseKhama will be able to assume the chieftainship. We would point out that itis not without precedent in the history of the tribes of the Bechuanaland Pro-tectorate that a Chief has, for a period of years, been unable for one reason or another to carry out his duties as Chief.
Our findings may therefore be summed up shortly as follows: We, with regret but with no hesitation, are unable to recommend the recog-nition of Seretse Khama as Chief of the Bamangwato Tribe because : (1) Being a prohibited immigrant in the Union of South Africa, he will be unable to efficiently carry out his duties as Chief.(2) A friendly and co-operative Union of South Africa and SouthernRhodesia is essential to the well-being of the Tribe and indeed the wholeof the Bechuanaland Protectorate.(3) His recognition will undoubtedly cause disruption in the BamangwatoTribe.CHAPTER IVWe have found that in the present circumstances Seretse is not &quot; a fit and proper person &quot; to be Chief of the Bamangwato. If this finding is accepted,the administration will be faced with the problem of devising such arrange-ments for the conduct of the business normally performed by the NativeAuthority as appear to be in the best interests of the Tribe. While it is not within our terms of reference to make recommendations to this end, it appearsto us appropriate to mention some of the problems which will arise from ourfindings and, with diffidence, to suggest a course which might meet the immedi-ate needs of the situation. We would emphasise that we are, advisedly, makingno attempt to suggest any fundamental change in the basic structure of theNative Government other than that which must, it seems to us, inevitably flow from our finding.. Section 13 of the Bechuanaland Protectorate Native Administration Pro-clamation 1943 (No. 32 of 1943) prescribes that the Chief of a tribal area shallbe appointed to the office of Native Authority for the tribal area, and section 17 (1), as amended on the 7th November, 1949, provides that: &quot; Where the office of Native Authority constituted under this Proclama-tion is for the time being vacant or where in the opinion of the HighCommissioner it is desirable in the interests of peace, order and good government in the area, the High Commissioner may appoint any person orbody of persons to such office.&quot;The position at the time of writing this Report is that Tshekedi is stillnominally Native Authority, though he has left the Bamangwato Reserve andhas admitted to us in evidence that he is no longer able to perform the func-tions of Native Authority.In fact the Tribal Administration, as such, has broken down completely andthe District Commissioner is carrying on the essential Native Administrationwithout, however, possessing the power of a Native Authority. We under-stand that it is the Governments intention to make the District Commissionerthe Native Authority in place of Tshekedi under Section 17 (1) of the proclamation (as amended) which we have quoted above. With respect, weconsider that this is the only course possible in the interests of peace, order and good government in the Bamangwato Reserve.An alternative procedure which might be followed in such circumstances would be that laid down in Section 7 of the Proclamation which providesinter alia that where a Chief (which term includes Regent) becomes incapable of performing adequately the duties of his office, the tribe in Kgotla should&quot; designate the person or persons who, subject to the approval of the HighCommissioner, shall exercise the functions of the chieftainship or shall assistthe Chief in the exercise of his functions.&quot; We are, however, satisfied that this procedure would yield no satisfactory result in the present circumstances,
where Seretse is desired as Chief by the vast majority of the tribe, and where no other member or members of the Chiefs family would be generally acceptable as Regent or as a Council of Regency.Our belief is that a satisfactory solution to the immediate administrativeproblem can only be found in arrangements whereby the District Commissioneris the Native Authority in place of the Chief. Acting in this capacity he would,no doubt, be assisted by an advisory council selected from the tribal leaders and would continue to use the existing agencies of administration. We have inmind such agencies as the Chiefs representatives in the districts, the regimentalleaders, headman and committees which have been set up for special purposes,such as education. We suggest that this arrangement should not continue forlonger than is necessary in the interests of the orderly good government of the tribe. Circumstances may alter so as to make the recognition of Seretse as chief practicable or, alternatively, it may be found possible successfully to employ the procedure set out in Section 7 of the Proclamation, to which wehave referred, to select another Regent or a Council of Regency.We are satisfied from the evidence before us that a period of direct rule would be in the immediate interests of the Bamangwato, not only because itseems to us the only satisfactory way out of the impasse which has arisen inconnection with the chieftainship, but also because it would afford oppor-tunities for healing tribal dissensions and for the reformation of the tribaladministration. It is clear from the evidence of the District Commissioner,Serowe, that much work is required in this latter direction, especially in regardto the working of the Native Treasury.Parallel arrangements would no doubt be possible in respect of the hearing of those court cases at present falling under the jurisdiction of the Court ofthe Chief of the Bamangwato, and some consequential amendment to theNative Administration and Native Courts Proclamations may be required.In addition to the powers conferred upon him as Native Authority or by virtue of his judicial powers, the Chief has certain customary social andadministrative functions to perform, such as giving the word for the annualcultivations to start. How such duties are to be discharged in the absence ofa Chief will be for the Administration and Kgotla to settle in consultation.If it is decided to introduce a period of direct rule on the lines suggested,the position of Seretse and Tshekedi will require careful consideration. while we have found that in the present circumstances Seretse is not &quot; a fit and proper person &quot; to be Chief, he remains the Chief designate and the person to whom customary allegiance is willingly accorded by the majority of the tribe. In the present unfortunate circumstances we believe that his con-tinued presence in the Bamangwato Reserve would be an embarrassment tothe Administration and not in the best interests of tribal tranquility and ofthe orderly conduct of business. At the same time we feel that, as Chiefdesignate, he should be enabled to maintain himself in a manner fitting tohis status, so long as he so conducts himself as not to embarrass theAdministration of the Reserve.We accordingly hope that the Administration will be able to arrange that he be paid such subsidy as will enable him to live in appropriate style,provided that he lives outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate, or until theHigh Commissioner is satisfied that it is in the interests of the Tribe that hebe permitted to return. We have suggested that such subsidy should be dependant on Seretse leaving the Protectorate because we believe that con-dition to be essential to the peace and good order of the bamangwato reserve. We would go further, and suggest that if Seretse does not volun-voluntarily leave the High Commissioner should consider using powers to ensurehis removal. If it should become necessary for Seretse to attend sittings of the local High Court, as is possible, special permission could no doubt
be granted to him to proceed to Lobatsi, where the High Court normallysits,. &apos;   &apos; / ;. &apos;. &apos;        &apos; .;.      ................... ...Tshekedi will, we understand, soon cease to be Regent. He has statedquite clearly that he would in no circumstances agree to become Chief in thefuture, though he has stressed that he would be willing to continue to serve the Tribe in some other capacity. In the meantime, he has removed himself and his belongings to Rametsana in the Bakwena Reserve, which is adjacent to the Bamangwato Reserve. It is not for us to judge Tshekedi&apos;s action in leaving the Bamangwato country with his followers or to speculate as tothe motives which caused him to do so. Whatever the merits of the matter,the result has been to cause some considerable tribal disorder, and his presence adjacent to the Bamangwato Reserve no doubt constitutes a potentialfocus for intrigue and malcontents.. This energetic and forceful personalityhas, however, borne the -main burden of the tribal administration of the bamangwato for the past 23 years and we hope that, for so long as his conduct and activities do not interfere with the orderly administration ofthe tribe, he Will receive some adequate pension, provided that enquiries nowbeing made into the Native Treasury affairs do not indicate that the grantof such pension would be inappropriate. In any event we suggest that any pension granted should, at any rate for some years, be dependent onTshekedi remaining outside the Bamangwato Reserve. If he is not preparedto remain outside the Reserve of his own volition, the High commissioner will no doubt consider using powers to order him to do so. If he remainspeacefully in retirement , or the present, it may be found possible for hisundoubted ability, energy and initiative to be employed in the future in theservice of the Bamahgwato people.Inevitably a period of difficulty, reorganisation and adjustment lies beforethose administering the Bamangwato country. Recent events have given the traditional system a rude shock, but history shows that it is well accustomed to withstanding such a shock, and we believe that by adopting some suchcourse as we have suggested the essential features of the tribal administration will survive unimpaired and may indeed emerge with renewed vigour whenthe present difficulties have disappeared. Had the tribal government con-sisted of a Chief and Council, on the pattern now familiar in many parts of africa, it might well have been possible to carry on indirect rule or Africanlocal government, without the District Commissioner assuming the dutiesof Native Authority; but in the Bamangwato country power to govern is vested in the Chief himself and he governs subject to the usual over-riding authority of the Administration, in consultation with the full tribalmeeting or Kgotla. His position was aptly described by the Hon. Mr. JusticeE. F. Watermeyer, presiding over a special court in the Bechuanaland Pro-tectorate in 1936.   He said : &quot; Under native custom the Chief resembles a Saxon King more than a constitutional monarch. He is a representative chief, with wide discre-tionary power; he is the legislature, executive and the final Court ofAppeal. In exercising these functions he takes advice from whom hepleases, but he is to some extent controlled by tribal opinion because he has to make his decisions in public in the Kgotla where he is boundto listen to anyone who cares to speak. In that way he feels the pulseof the tribe, but the decision is his and he can disregard the opinionof the majority. In practice, however, he follows tribal opinion, becausethe security of his position as Chief to some extent depends upon thecharacter of his rule. . . .&quot;It is because the Chief of the Bamangwato plays such an important role in tribal government that we believe that during the temporary eclipse of the
		Chairman.R.	S.	HUDSON Member.G.	E.	NETTELTON. Member.F.	G.	HOLMES, Secretary.Pretoria.1st December, 1949.chieftainship there must be resort to the modified form of direct rule whichwe suggest, a direct rule which will, no doubt, be combined with a progres-sive development programme.CHAPTER VIn conclusion, we should like to express our appreciation for the arrange-ments made in connection with this enquiry, and our most sincere and gratefulthanks to our hostesses and hosts upon whom we have been billeted for solong. Their unfailing hospitality and good nature under trying circumstances will long be remembered by us. While to our hard working Secretary and his staff we are deeply indebted, not only for the able manner in which theycarried out what might be called their normal duties, but for the innumerableways in which they have managed to make the days Spent on this enquiry apleasure rather than a duty.WALTER HARRAGIN,
Draft DespatchSOUTH AFRICA: BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATECommonwealth Relations Office,(No.      ) Downing Street,Sir, January, 1950.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 307dated 6th December, with which you forwarded the report of the judicial enquiry into questions relating to the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribein the Bechuanaland Protectorate.2. I have carefully studied this report, together with the evidence submittedto the Enquiry, and have reached the conclusion that, as recommended by theEnquiry, recognition of Seretse Khama as Chief of the Bamangwato Tribeshould be withheld. In reaching this decision I have been influenced mainly by three considerations:  (i) the danger of disintegration not only in the Bamangwato Reserve butin the Bechuanaland Protectorate as a whole;(ii) the irresponsibility shown by Seretse himself, which throws doubt onhis suitability to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities ofa Chief;(iii) the existence of a strong body of African opinion in Southern Africagenerally against recognition.3. I will make a public announcement of my decision as soon as possible on a date which 1 will arrange with you, and will at the same time issue a white Paper giving the detailed reasons which have led me to the conclusions have reached. An advance copy of the White Paper is attached for yourinformation.4. I am satisfied that for the time being Seretse should not be permitted toreturn to the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and that Tshekedi, whose Regencywill be terminated, should not be allowed to resume residence in the bamangwato Reserve.
