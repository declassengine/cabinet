Printed for the Cabinet&apos;.   March 1950SECRET Copy No. 32C.P. (50) 42mh March, 1950CABINETPRIVILEGES  GRANTED  TO FOREIGN VISITING forces memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of state the Problem1. On 21st December, 1949, an agreement was signed by the United Kingdomand the other Brussels Treaty Powers on the status of members of their armed forces who are on duty in pursuance of the Treaty in the territory of one of the signatory Powers other than their own. This agreement cannot come into force until each of the signatory Powers has made any necessary amendment to itsdomestic laws, and, so far as this country is concerned, we cannot implement the parts of the agreement relating to criminal jurisdiction until legislation has been passed conferring concurrent jurisdiction on the courts-martial of the visiting forces of the other signatories. But since the agreement with these Powers wasnegotiated it has become clear that United States forces are likely to be stationed in this country for some considerable time to come. The United States visiting forces at present enjoy, under temporary legislation, exclusive criminal juris-diction. It seems out of the question to introduce legislation dealing with theposition of foreign visiting forces without including some permanent provisionwith regard to the United States forces. The main purpose of this memorandum is to seek authority for an approach to the United States authorities with aview to seeking their concurrence in new arrangements which would give themless privileges than they have at present, and which should then be embodied in legislation applicable to all foreign visiting forces United States, brussels treaty Powers and others.Present Position2. (a) Commonwealth visiting forces may, under the Visiting Forces(British Commonwealth) Act, 1938 (a permanent measure), exercise over their members powers relating to discipline and internal administration. This, in effect,means that they may exercise criminal jurisdiction concurrently with our owncriminal courts, except that, by agreement, offences of murder, manslaughter andrape, and in Scotland culpable homicide, are dealt with only by our own courts.The Act also regulates the position of Commonwealth visiting forces in suchmatters as exemption from Acts from which our own armed forces are exempt,and the detention of offenders sentenced by their military courts in this country.(b) The position of the allied forces (other than the United States forces)during the war was governed by the Allied Forces Act, 1940, which was on linessimilar to the Act of 1933 and, although it is still in force, was intended as atemporary war-time measure.(c) The position of the United States forces is governed by three measures : -(i) The United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act, 1942. This Actgave the United States authorities exclusive criminal jurisdiction in... pursuance of the agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe United States Government recorded in the notes scheduled to theAct. It is still in operation, but was intended and recognised to be atemporary measure.38496
(ii) The United States of America [Visiting Forces) Order, 1942, made underthe Allied Forces Act; 1940. This Order places the United states forces in a similar position to that of the Commonwealth forces asregards the subsidiary provisions of the 1933 Act referred to in the concluding sentence of paragraph (a) above.(iii) The Defence (Burials, Inquests and Registration of Deaths) Regulations,1942, continued in force by the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Pro-visions) Act, 1947. Under these regulations, a coroner cannotcomplete an inquest on a person who was at the time of his death amember of the American forces; and must also adjourn the inquest ifa member of the United States forces is charged before a United Statescourt with an offence involving responsibility for the death of theperson on whom the inquest is being held.Brussels Treaty Agreement3. It had been contemplated that, in order to enable us to implement theagreement with the Brussels Treaty Powers referred to in paragraph 1, legislation should be introduced conferring on the visiting forces of those Powers (and ofPowers associated for the like purposes with the United Kingdom) concurrentjurisdiction with our own courts in respect of criminal offences committed bymembers of the visiting forces. It was, however, agreed with these Powers thatmurder and manslaughter, and in Scotland culpable homicide, would always bedealt with by our own criminal courts; and it was also agreed that, apart fromthese crimes, an offender would normally be handed over to be dealt with by hisown authorities where the victim of the offence was a member of the same visitingforce. But it does not seem possible to proceed with legislation in that form inview of the prospect of American troops being stationed here for some considerable time to come, since (a) their position is at present governed by temporary legis-lation, whereas legislation applying to the Brussels Treaty forces would be intro-duced as a permanent measure; and (b) whereas the United States forces atpresent enjoy exclusive jurisdiction, it was proposed to confer on the brussels treaty forces only concurrent jurisdiction.Possible courses of action4. We have therefore been considering what permanent provision might bemade with regard to the privileges of United States visiting forces, as well asthose of other Powers. We think that there are four possible courses, of which only the fourth seems to us to be acceptable : (a) To proceed with a Bill on the lines of that previously contemplated soas to give all foreign visiting forces, including those of the UnitedStates, concurrent jurisdiction, and to repeal the Act of 1942.But it is highly improbable that the United States authorities would agree tothe privileges whicn their forces at present enjoy being so much curtailed. It wouldthen be possible, for instance, for a United States soldier to be committed for trialon a coroner V inquisition; and it would be possible for a private prosecutor totake criminal proceedings against a United States soldier in our courts.(b) To introduce legislation conferring concurrent jurisdiction  on  the brussels Treaty and other associated Powers, but also providing thatthe United States forces should enjoy their existing exclusivejurisdiction in perpetuity.   -But Parliament would be very reluctant to approve a permanent grant ofexclusive jurisdiction. The Act of 1942 was accepted as a war-time, measure,but there was serious criticism of it. It would also create difficulty with our other friends, who would be surprised at legislation conferring certain privilegeson them and greater privileges on the United States forces.(c) To introduce legislation granting exclusive jurisdiction to all foreignvisiting forces.There would be much opposition to this in Parliament, and it seems un-justifiable on its own merits/
(d) To grant to all foreign visiting forces, including those of the UnitedStates, a modified form of the privileges which it was proposed togrant to the Brussels Treaty Powers.This is the course we favour, and we suggest that an attempt should be madeto come to an agreement with the United States Government which would involvethe introduction of legislation with the following provisions : .&apos;.(i) By conferring on a foreign visiting force jurisdiction in matters relatingto discipline and internal administration, the Bill would in effect give to the courts and authorities of that visiting force jurisdiction con-current with that of our own courts in criminal cases, and exclusivejurisdiction over purely military offences; the Bill would be applicableby Order In Council to any Power with which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was associated for the purposes of defence.(ii) No criminal proceedings should be brought in our courts against anymember of such a force save by the consent of the Attorney General orthe Director of Public Prosecutions, or in Scotland the Lord Advocate.This would mean in practice that the jurisdiction of the UnitedKingdom courts would be exercised only when public policy made itexpedient that it should be so exercised for instance, when a memberof a visiting force and a citizen of this country were accomplices ina serious offence.(iii) The Defence (Burial, Inquests and Registration of Deaths) Regulations,1942, would be re-enacted in permanent form and would be applicableto all visiting forces.(iv) Power would be included to apply to visiting forces the subsidiary pro-visions contained in the Act of 1933, for example exemptions from theordinary law which are enjoyed by the armed forces of the Crown.(v) The Bill would be applied to a foreign Power only if His Majesty was satisfied that it was expedient to do so; one of the considerations to be taken into account would be whether the foreign Power was prepared to grant reciprocity.(viy Provision might be included, on the lines of the repealed Regulation 12 (2)of the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations, 1942, making it possiblefor a member of a foreign visiting force who was arrested withoutwarrant to be detained in custody for longer than the period allowed by the ordinary law so as to give time for him to be handed over toan escort from the visiting force concerned.(vii) The Acts of 1940 and 1942 would be repealed.5. We accordingly ask for authority to open discussions with the UnitedStates authorities with a view to securing their agreement to an arrangement on the lines of that set out in paragraph 4 (d).During the discussions leading to the passing of the 1942 Act the UnitedStates authorities based their claim to exclusive jurisdiction on their view ofinternational law and on United States constitutional theory; but it could be argued with some force that although this claim might be applicable in the caseof an occupied country it is going beyond accepted international practice whenforces of one country are coming to another country, in peace-time, by invitation.It could also be explained that in practice the Americans would come very near,under the new arrangements, to retaining exclusive criminal jurisdiction, andthat in the ordinary course a member of their forces who committed an offencewould be handed over to them to be dealt with. There is also the consideration that in Article IV of the agreement of 27th March, 1941, relating to the leasedbases (Cmd. 6259) the United States accepted the position that they had con-current jurisdiction with the local courts in respect of offences, except securityoffences, committed by members of their forces outside the leased areas; as regardssecurity offences outside the leased areas, and all offences within the areas, theyhad the prior right to exercise jurisdiction. We understand that the amendmentof Article IV has been under consideration with the United States authoritiessince 1946, and that an agreement was drafted at a conference with UnitedStates representatives in which (a) they conceded to the local courts concurrentjurisdiction in respect of offences committed by their forces within the leasedareas in time of peace (ex:opt offences affecting United States interests only);and (b) they were to be grxnted virtually exclusive jurisdiction over all offences
committed by their forces outside as well as inside the leased areas in time ofwar. In 1949 the United States proposed to withdraw (a) above, but to retain (b).These proposals have been rejected and the negotiations have reached a difficultstage.On the other hand, we are likely to be met by the theoretical argument that united States constitutional theory would be violated by acceptance of anythingless than exclusive jurisdiction, and by the practical consideration that, even ifthe Americans were prepared to accept less if only the United Kingdom were concerned, they could not do so for fear of having therefore to accept less inother European countries in which their forces might be stationed. In the last resort, they might refuse to send members of their forces to this country at allif we refused to grant them exclusive jurisdiction.Notwithstanding these difficulties, we feel that the objections to the other three courses suggested in paragraph 4 are so overwhelming that we should try to arrive at a solution with the United States authorities on the proposed lines.We hope that if the position is frankly explained to them, they will see our difficulties, in particular the force of Parliamentary objection to proposals con-ferring exclusive jurisdiction, and the impossibility of giving exclusive juris-diction to them and something less to the other Powers. If they agreed to thecourse we suggest, the legislation which would then be introduced would makeit possible to give to the Brussels Treaty Powers more than they have asked for.It would in any case enable us to treat all our friends in the same way.Other Commonwealth Governments6. If legislation on the lines suggested were introduced in respect of foreignvisiting forces, it seems to us desirable to put visiting forces from the Common-wealth in the same position. Canada, for instance, as a North Atlantic TreatyPower, would find it difficult to understand why she had privileges inferior tothose of any of the other Treaty Powers. The new legislation might thereforeapply also to other Commonwealth countries and might repeal the Act of 1933 aswell as the Acts of 1940 and 1942.Other North Atlantic Treaty Powers7. If the Americans accept a solution on the lines suggested it will bedesirable to ensure that the agreements with various Powers who will havevisiting forces in this country are based on the same general principle and are capable of implementation by the same legislation; it is not suggested they need be identical in point of detail.conclusion.   We ask for authority (i) to enter into negotiations with the United States Government with aview to securing their agreement to an arrangement on the lines setout in paragraph 4 id) above; and(ii) if these negotiations succeed, to prepare the legislation which would be needed to implement such an agreement and any similar agreementsalready concluded or to be concluded with other North Atlantic treaty powers.J.J.
