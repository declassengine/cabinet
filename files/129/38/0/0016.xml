(50) 1627th January, 1950CABINETPROGRESS OF CIVIL AVIATION UNDER  THE PRESENTADMINISTRATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Civil AviationPrefatory Note and Summary of Main FeaturesAchievementsAt the suggestion of the Civil Aviation Committee I am circulating, for theinformation of the Cabinet, the annexed report on the progress of Civil Aviationsince 1945. This seeks to show how the policy embodied in the White Paper ofDecember 1945 has worked out in practice. It will help, I hope, to do justice to all those who have been concerned in Civil Aviation during that period, andto assist my colleagues in forming policy after the Election and.to indicate whatappear to me suitable lines upon which our record can be explained and, ifnecessary, defended at the Election.2. In this note I am concerned only with the achievements of the corporations, but the report deals also with the provision of aerodromes and aidsto air navigation. This work occupies the greater part of the staff of my own.Ministry and the achievements are impressive. They are, however, outside thefield of general controversy, but no story of the development of civil aviation inrecent years would be complete without a short description of what has beenaccomplished.3. The nationalised Corporations started from scratch or in some waysbehind scratch and were set a tremendous task at the end of the war; it is fair to claim that they have accomplished it. They have extended our services through-out the world. The current route mileage is 90,000 and the capacity ton-milesoffering amount to 13 millions a month and roughly five times the pre-war scale of effort. Compared with 1947-48 the first year of the true post-war commercialphase output of capacity ton-miles in the current year shows an increase of 67 percent., productivity an increase of 100 per cent., and. unit costs a reduction of 30 percent.   (For further details see table on p. 9 of the report.)4. Our Corporations have won for themselves and our country the samereputation for regularity, courtesy, safety and general efficiency as our shipping companies have achieved in the past. A Minister of Civil Aviation is buffeteda good deal from one quarter and another, but individual travellers have been almost embarrassing with their continual messages of thanks for the way theyhave been treated by our Airlines.   Herein lies solid achievement.deficits and Aircraft5. All this, however, is apt to be taken for granted and the critics many ofthem political opponents have fastened on the high cost attached to these results.Put in the simplest terms it was decided in 1945 with the approval of all parties toadopt a policy of compassing rapidly the routes of the world with British aircraftthat, for reasons in no way discreditable to us, were much inferior over the longCopy No.31
distances to those of all our leading competitors. It was foreseen by all thoughour opponents are apt to forget it that such a policy would place a heavy handicapon our own Airlines, as compared with foreigners and that they would requirein consequence considerable subsidy.   What was foreseen has occurred.6. As a result the British aircraft manufacturing industry so essential inwar and so valuable to the export trade in peace finds itself in a position of strength and promise that would have been quite out of the question if oui&apos;Corporations had been allowed to compete on equal terms with their competitorsin the purchase of foreign aircraft. In other words, as a matter of agreed national policy our nationalised Corporations have been heavily handicapped in theinterests of the all-important aircraft manufacturing industry whose prosperityhas understandably been considered to be so vital to our national survival.7. The maximum subsidies provided for in the Act of 1945 amounted to 84 million over ten years and  36 million over the first four. In the first fouryears the deficits in round figures will have amounted to about  41 million. Inthe next six we shall be very unlucky indeed if they are not much below theremaining  43 million of the total maximum subsidy. Aviation is the mostspeculative of industries, but there is every reason to suppose that we shall overthe whole ten-year period have kept well below the maximum deficit envisaged.8. It is quite true, however, that the losses have been heavier over the first four years than most people anticipated, viz.,  10 - 2 million in 1946,  11 -1 million in 1947-48,  9-7 million in 1948-49 and probably about the same in 1949-50.The reasons are set out at length in the following Paper. Passing over suchessential issues as the flying of uneconomic routes and the wide dispersal ofmaintenance bases which were in mind when the policy was drawn up, I wouldhere mention as a chief cause of unforeseen losses the various disasters and delaysthat have occurred on the aircraft front.9. No one foresaw or could have foreseen the wretched business of the tudor II or the tragedy of the Tudor IV. The grounding of the latter alonehas cost the Corporation at least  If million (apart from capital costs) duringthe current year, whilst the Tudor chapter as a whole has cost the government about  10 million in nugatory expenditure on aircraft and large indeterminatesums in continuing losses of the Corporation. More than any other single factorthe lateness, failure and mysterious happenings connected with the Tudor classmust be regarded as having swelled the deficits beyond the anticipated cost. Theeffects of other aircraft delays, more particularly those of the Stratocruisers andthe Hermes, are dealt with in the report.Efficiency of Corporations10. The question remains whether the Corporations have conducted them-selves with maximum efficiency and economy in the face of their many difficulties and problems. I venture to repeat that their positive achievements are impressive.I admit on the other hand that they cannot be exempted over the period as a wholefrom the criticism of over-staffing and of lacking sufficient cost consciousness.(I refer to B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. in particular.) The figures of the staff employedby B.O.A.C. tell the story in a nutshell.11., The staff of the Corporation at 31st March of each year numbered : 1946 ......      ......      ...... 22,9491947 .................. 24,464-     ,   1948 ................... 21,8441949 .......    ......      ...      ... 18,920At the end of September 1949 the strength was 18,035. In a renewed economydrive since 1st November, 1949, the figures for B.O.A.C. have come down and are- coming down still further. There is no aspect of the work of the Corporations-apart from regularity and safety on which I have concentrated more intenselythan on the elimination of surplus staff.12. Taking the period from March 1947 we find a reduction of over25 per cent, in a rapidly expanding business. All concerned, can extract some reasonable satisfaction from this latter trend especially as it has gone hand inhand with the development of increasingly good relations between the management
and the Trades Unions (both in B.O.A.C. and B.E.A.). But one cannot ignore the implication that far too lax standards of staffing were accepted in the immediate post-war years. It is hardly profitable to-day to consider how far this was inevitable in view of the urgent demands for a rapid world-wide expansion of services in accordance with the requirements of national policy.13. I had hoped to be able to report at this stage that the last year ofthe present Government would see a substantial reduction in the total deficits of theCorporation. Mainly, though not quite entirely, owing to factors outside thecontrol of the Corporation that is the Tudor disaster, the Stratocruisers andHermes delays and the extra loss of over  800,000 due to revaluation this wishhas not been fulfilled. The deficit during the current year will amount on a substantially increased output to approximately the same as in 1948-49, whenthe figure was  9-7 million, following a loss of  11-1 million in 1947-48.14. But this disappointing global result obscured B.E.A&apos;s very encouragingand, indeed, remarkable performance. The results of the first six months of thecurrent year show a loss of only  84,000 compared with the loss of over  1 million in the corresponding period of 1948-49. Over the whole year it is anticipatedthat their deficit will be no more than half of that for 1948-49 and will fail withinthe limit set them of  1,500,000 which the late Chairman thought it quite outside their power to attain.15. B.E.A&apos;s current figures show what one of our nationalised Corporationscan accomplish when relieved of any special aircraft handicap, able to concentrateits operations and maintenance and possessed of an organisation thoroughly over-hauled and a staff right on their toes. Its achievements point the way to what can be accomplished in British Civil Aviation generally when similar conditionsare fulfilled all round and under the existing Chairmen and with existingprospects I have every belief that they will be.Future16. Taking the Corporations together, as far as anything is certain inaviation, there should be a really large reduction in the deficit in 1950-51 and a progressive fall in subsequent years. It will then be clear to all, as is now, I think,realised by those who are properly informed, that the plans laid down for british civil Aviation in the Paper published by our Government in 1945 were well andtruly conceived.17. Much splendid work has since been accomplished and in spite of manyaclverse developments and no doubt the usual number of things that could havebeen done differently in the light of after knowledge, the four-and-half years justconcluded point the way to very bright prospects in British Civil Aviation, if we continue ever more vigorously and with still more ingenuity and assiduity along the same road in accordance with our original plan.P..Ministry of Civil Aviation,27th January, 1950.
ANNEXREVIEW OF PROGRESS OF CIVIL AVIATION SINCE 1945&apos; The object of the following review of progress of Civil Aviation since 1945is to compare policy with achievement in building up air transport and theground organisation, to explain the causes of the continuing losses of the air corporations up to and including the current year and the reasons why aprogressively more favourable outlook for the future can be predicted.The review accordingly comprises the following sections : I. The position when the Government came into power.II. Formulation of policy of the present Government.III. The policy of the Government for the organisation and operation ofair transport;  the record of achievement, the conclusions to bedrawn and future prospects.IV. The policy of the Government for the provision of the aerodromes and ground organisation together with an outline of progress made,I.-THE POSITION WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAME INTO POWEEWhen the Government came into power in 1945, civil aviation was stillvirtually in the skeleton war-time form to which it had been progressively reducedas its resources had been diverted to the prosecution of the war, mainly in supportof Transport Command of the R.A.F. B.O.A.C., created under the british overseas Airways Act, 1939, by the amalgamation of Imperial Airways andBritish Airways to form a statutory Corporation, much on the lines of thepresent B.O.A.C. and British European Airways, was still harnessed to war tasksand had not operated commercially from its birth in April 1940. british european Airways did not exist, except in an embryonic military form as a Wingof Transport Command, whilst the future British South American Airways was still a name and the goal of a consortium of South Atlantic shipping companies which planned to operate post-war air services to Central and South Americawithout subsidy. In B.O.A.C. was concentrated the main body of experiencedpre-war airline personnel on whom depended the post-war establishment and expansion of our commercial air transport; the resources of the few private companies which had operated internal air services essential for war purposeswere of much less value.The Coalition Government in March 1945 had announced its policy for post-war civil aviation (Cmd. 6605).   The main features of this policy were (i) Air Transport. To establish a world-wide network of air services, forwhich the main instruments would be three statutory Corporations,one to provide Imperial communications, another to establishEuropean services and a third to operate services to Central andSouth America. The first Corporation was to be financedpredominantly with State capital and would be subsidised, whilst theother two Corporations would be financed partly with State capital and partly with private capital mainly drawn from the surface transport industries. These two Corporations were expected to operate without subsidy. Private companies were to be eligible,under a licensing system, to compete equally with the Corporationsto operate on routes not assigned to them at the outset of their operations.(ii) Aerodromes and Ground Organisation. The pre-war policy for theprovision, maintenance and operation of aerodromes was to continue.Apart from one or two major State-owned aerodromes, this left tomunicipalities and private owners, with free navigation and metero-logical facilities provided by the Government, the responsibility foraerodromes and ground organisation.The fulfilment of this policy had not progressed beyond the preparatory andinitial planning stages when the present Government came into power.
II.-POLICY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENTHence, one of the first tasks of the Government was to formulate its policy as a prelude to rebuilding civil aviation. In a memorandum (C.A.C. (45) 3)presented by the then Minister of Civil Aviation to the Civil Aviation Committee,a review was made of the problems requiring policy decisions over the whole field of civil aviation activity embracing policy in the international field (includingCommonwealth co-operation), the form of organisation for operating UnitedKingdom air services (covering both scheduled and charter operations), aerodromepolicy, aircraft policy, private flying and participation in airline development inforeign countries.This present review of the achievements of the Government, however, is con-fined to the organisation of air transport operations and of the aerodromes and ground facilities, by which the public will judge the effectiveness of the policy.Decisions on these latter aspects were subsequently announced in Command 6712in December 1945 and given statutory effect in the Civil Aviation Act, 1946 (July).III.-AIR TRANSPORT POLICY, ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTUREPROSPECTSIt was decided that the scheduled air transport services of the UnitedKingdom should be placed under national ownership and control in order to guarantee the public disinterested expansion of the nation &apos;s air services witheconomy and efficiency. Non-scheduled (or charter) operations were to be opento private companies as well as the socialised industry. It was concluded thatthe objective should be to provide a world-wide network of air services in thenational interests on routes of Imperial, economic and strategic value. In this new field of air transport it was considered that the United Kingdom should endeavour to establish a leading position in the same way as it had succeeded in doing in shipping. Considerations of national prestige and security also played,and have continued to play, their part.For the purpose of providing this world-wide network of regular air services for public use, it was decided to establish three statutory Corporations with thefollowing spheres of responsibility :  (i) Routes between the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries,the United States and the Far East B.O.A.C.(ii) Routes between the United Kingdom and the Continent and internalroutes in the United Kingdom British European Airways,(iii) Routes between the United Kingdom and South America British south american Airways.The Corporations were to enjoy a monopoly of the rights to operate scheduled services available to the general public, and were given the necessary statutoryprotection under Section 23 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1946. It was also decidedthat they should receive subsidy assistance for a period of ten years, after whichit was hoped they would become self-supporting. The amount of subsidy was fixed at a maximum of  10 million a year for 1946-47 and 1947-48 and  8 million a year for the remaining eight years until 1956. The decision to pay subsidyrecognised the need to provide uneconomic services in the public interest and the requirement referred to below to operate with British aircraft types.The only major modification of policy during the lifetime of the Governmenthas been the merger of B.O.A.C. and B.S.A.A. under the Airways CorporationsAct, 1949. It was contemplated from the outset and, indeed announced by theLord President during the passage of the Civil Aviation Bill, that the policy for determining the number of Corporations would be flexible and that modifica-tions might be made in the light of experience. It. was becoming increasinglyapparent that greater efficiency and economy could be achieved by operating north atlantic and South Atlantic services with a single fleet, under one management,but the critical aircraft situation created by the withdrawal of the Tudors from service on B.S.A.A. routes was the decisive factor which led to the merger last year.Another important aspect of the policy for providing the air transport services was a decision to require the Corporations to use British aircraft types.
Whilst exceptions to this policy have necessarily been made from time to time toenable American or Canadian aircraft to be acquired for operation on routes f0rwhich existing British types were unsuitable, the &quot; Fly British &quot; policy has notbeen abrogated and has exercised a profound influence on the results of theoperations of the Corporations, particularly those of B.O.A.C.Review of Progress of the Air corporations in reviewing the achievements of the Corporations in carrying out the policyof the Civil Aviation Act, it will be desirable to deal separately with the years194-5 to 1949 and with the current year 1949-50.The following Appendices are attached Appendix 1, showing Trend of Output.Appendix 2, showing Staff and Productivity.Appendix 3, showing Operating Results and Grants.Appendix 4, showing Unit Costs, Revenues and Deficits. *General Trend of ResultsNoticeable features of period 1945-49 are (a) the progressive decline in therate of losses of B.O.A.C. from  8,076,844 in 1946-47 to  5,844,695 in 1948-49;(&amp;) the varying results of British European Airways which commenced with a loss of  2,157,973 in 1946-47, rose to  3,573,989 in 1947-48 and fell again to 2,763,085 in 1948-49, and (c) the progressive deterioration in the result of.S.A.A., which opened in 1946-47 with a profit of  77,336 and concluded in1948-49 with a loss of  1,133,082. The results of B.S.A.A., of course, were com-pletely overshadowed by the unfortunate Tudor saga.The overall picture, however, is one of disquieting losses at an uncomfortablyhigh rate. An analysis of the results of the Corporations over this period showsthat on the one hand there have been certain major and persistent causes whichhave operated throughout the period and, on the other hand, a number of secondarycauses such as the legacy of the war which overshadowed and produced, the abnormal years 1945-46 and 1946-47, and the subsequent unsettled world conditions, currency restrictions and rising costs, which have affected one period or another.Effect of Uneconomic AircraftAmong the persistent causes of the continuing high rate of losses of B.O.A.C.and of the steady deterioration of B.SA.A., uneconomic aircraft is the dominatingfactor. The Government White Paper of December 1945, Cmd. 6712, wasprophetically true in the statement &quot; Airline operation depends for its advance-ment on technical progress, for success or failure is more dependent on the typeof equipment used than on any other factor. An airline equipped with outmodedaircraft, no matter how efficiently its operations and business are conducted, will soon be outdistanced by another using aircraft of superior and more economicalperformance.&apos;&apos;&apos; Adherence to the &quot; Fly British &quot; policy, subject to unavoidablepurchases of American and Canadian aircraft, has proved expensive in the caseof B.O.A.C. and B.S.A.A., the operators of four-engined aircraft. Even in thecase of the British European Airways, the introduction of the twin-enginedVickers Viking proved costly in the initial years 1946-47 and 1947-48, but this aircraft has now settled down and is proving to be an economic type.B.O.A.C. commenced this four-year period with a multiplicity of four-engmedtypes, including obsolescent flying-boats and adaptations of military types suchas the Lancastrian and the York. It soon became apparent that there was no british aircraft in existence, or in prospect, capable of operating competitivelyon the North Atlantic, and six American Constellation aircraft were purchasedand introduced into service in 1946-47. In addition six Boeing Stratocruiserswere ordered in the same year, but delivery is only now beginning. The Corpora-tion plans, in the early stages, were based on the replacement of flying-boats,Yorks and Lancastrians on the Empire routes by the Tudors. The unfortunatehistory of these aircraft and their ultimate abandonment is well known; as aresult at least two valuable years were lost in re-equipping the Corporations withan interim type pending the emergence of the first post-war generation of suitableBritish transport aircraft. During this period the B.O.A.C. switched to the tudor 4, a modified version of the Tudor 1 which B.S.A.A. had ordered andhad introduced into service in 1947-48.   Both Corporations suffered from the
serious misfortune which overtook this aircraft following the disappearance0f the Star Ariel and led to its ultimate abandonment as a passenger type forthe Corporations.Delivery of the Handley Page Hermes, which was regarded as a promisingalternative to the Tudor, was expected to begin in July 1948, but this aircraft has still not passed its C. of A. trials. It is true that the delays in delivery of aircraft is not peculiar to the British types; the six Stratocruisers ordered byB.O.A.C. in 1946, for commencement of delivery in January 1948, have only nowstarted to come into service. But it is important to recognise that the &quot; FlyBritish &quot;&apos; policy, owing chiefly to the failure of the Tudor class and to the unfortunate repercussive delays in re-equipment, including the replacement of uneconomic medium size flying boats, has cost B.O.A.C. far more dearly than was originally foreseen. It was only in June 1948, when the failure of the tudor 2 was no longer in doubt, that the decision was taken to order the Canadairs(Argonauts) for the Empire routes to meet the serious situation then developing.Fortunately, delivery of these aircraft was completed ahead of schedule, but shortly after their introduction into service in August 1949 they had to be withdrawnfor a month for engine modifications. The type has been restored to serviceand is being brought progressively into operation.It is no less true that the decline of B.S.A.A. from a promising start mustbe attributed largely to the failure of the Tuclors. This Corporation boldlycommenced operations in 1946 with Lancastrian and York aircraft and, owingto the combination of the small scale of their initial operations and the lack of competition on their routes at the time, they were able to operate with full payloadsand to make a small profit in 1946-47. In 1947-48, however, the Corporationbegan to complain about the delay in the delivery of Tudor aircraft and toemphasise the adverse effects on their commercial results of increasing competition from foreign operators equipped with modern American types.The first Tudor 4. (a modified Tudor 1) entered into service in October, 1947,but on 31st January, 1948, the Star Tiger mysteriously disappeared in flight,and it was necessary to ground the type pending exhaustive technical and opera-tional tests. This was the major cause of the B.S.A.A. loss of  421,481 in1947-48. The Tudor 4 did not return to service until August 1948, but the disappearance of the Star Ariel in January 1949, and the consequent abandon-ment of the type and cancellation of further deliveries had disastrous effects on the Corporation\s commercial results, and created the critical aircraft situationwhich was the decisive factor in merging the Corporation with B.O.A.C. in 1949.Dispersed BasesThe next persistent factor which has affected B.O.A.C. and, to a less extent,British European Airways, is the unavoidable dispersal of operations and main-tenance over many bases. It is a recognised pre-requisite of successful commercialairline operation that operations and aircraft maintenance should be concentrated on as few ba.ses as possible. The concentration of all operations and maintenanceof K L.M. at Schipol well exemplifies the importance of this aspect.The maintenance bases of B.O.A.C. were widely scattered for most of theperiod under review at many places in the United Kingdom and overseas, namely,Hum, Filton, Whitchurch, Croydon, Treforest, Hythe, London, Cairo andMontreal. The interim policy of concentration of operations and maintenance atLondon Airport and Filton, with eventual concentration wholly on london airport awaits provision of facilities at London Airport, where progress onconstruction has necessarily been retarded by Capital Investment Programmelimitations. Nevertheless, some progress has been made with the reduction of^e number of bases. In 1948-9 the base at Cairo was closed down, except for purely local needs, and the Constellation maintenance was transferred fromMontreal to Filton, but at some cost in disruption of services and in temporaryRecline in maintenance standards from which the Corporation is still suffering.Maintenance at Hurn and major repairs at Croydon are being progressivelytransferred to London Airport as hangarage becomes available, but until concen-wation on London becomes possible at the end of 1952, B.O.A.C. must continueto incur a heavy charge for dispersed bases.British European Airways likewise suffered similar disadvantages until1948-49 in the separate provision for maintenance at Speke, Northolt andRenfrew.   Their operations and maintenance are now concentrated on Northolt
for Continental services and Renfrew for internal services, with strikingreductions in maintenance costs.B.S.A.A. has not been affected by this problem. The comparatively small scale of their operations enabled them to concentrate their maintenance onLangley, which is comparatively near London Airport, their operational base, andinvolves little &quot; dead flying.&quot;Positive Achievements of the corporations in spite of serious handicaps imposed, on the Corporations by unsuitableaircraft types and dispersed bases, both B.O.A.C. and B.E.A.C. have undoubtedlyachieved high standards of operation and passenger handling which place themin the forefront of the world&apos;s airlines. Furthermore, there are positive achieve-ments to record in increased output and productivity and in reduction of costs.output from 1946-47, which marks the opening of the true post-war commercialphase, output of the three Corporations has progressively expanded, as is shownat Appendix 1. The capacity of ton-miles flown by B.O.A.C. increased by 9 percent, and 34 per cent, respectively in the years 1947-48 and 1948-49. Thecorresponding figures for B.E.A. were 269 per cent, and 32 per cent, and for.S.A.A. 72 per cent, and 27 per cent. These increases were maintained in 1949,and in the first six months of the year B.O.A.C.&apos;s output increased by 13 per cent,B.E.A.&apos;s by 32 per cent, and B.S.A.A.&apos;s by 52 per cent. B.S.A.A.&apos;s increase in output in the six months period was due largely to the Corporation^ participation in the Berlin airlift.ProductivityProductivity in both B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. rose steadily during the years1947-48 and 1948-49, and the improvement still continues. There was a slightdecline in the productivity of B.S.A.A. which was definitely undermanned in theearly years, but this decline has been arrested in the current year (Appendix 2).B.O.A.C. staff numbers were reduced from 24,464 on 31st March, 1947, to 18,920on 31st March, 1949, with productivity increasing from 210 in 1947-48 to 371capacity ton-miles per employee per month in 1948-49. The average rate for thefirst six months of 1949-50 was 471. No figures are available for B.E.A. in 1946-47but between the years 1947-48 and 1948-49 productivity rose from 229 to 307capacity ton-miles per employee and, in the first six months of 1949-50, to 549. lorexample, the introduction by B.E.A. early in 1949, of a bonus incentive scheme,which was agreed with the Trade Unions, resulted in a reduction of staff of 25 percent, in the engineering workshops at Northolt and an increa.se in flying hours of25 per cent. B.S.A.A. staffs increased from 1,031 on 31st March, 1947, to 2,088on 31st March, 1949, but this was due in part to actual increases in the outputof non-scheduled operations (e.g., Berlin airlift) and in part to planned increases of scheduled operations which did not materialise when the Tudors were with-drawn. Productivity for this Corporation, although showing a decline of 1,000to 852 capacity ton-miles per employee per month between 1947-48 and 1948-49rose to 1,037 in the first six months of 1949-50.Reduction in costs as is to be expected, broadly the trend of unit costs follows, inversely, the trend of productivity. As Appendix 4 shows, B.O.A.C.&apos;s costs per capacity ton-mile were reduced from 76-2d. for 1946-47 to 5Qd. for 1948-49 and to about 50rf.per capacity ton-mile in the first half of 1949-50. B.E.A. costs were similarlyreduced from 145 -Qd. for 1946-47 to 71 -5d. for 1948-49 and have now droppedto 45d. while B.S.A.A. costs per capacitv ton-mile increased from 34.-8d. io*1946-47 to 45 -4d. for 1948-49, but fell in April-September 1949, while the airliftwas on, to 33d.The reduction in costs was not accompanied by increased revenues.Appendix 4 shows that the operating revenues per capacity ton-mile of B.O.A.Cand B.S.A.A. declined, instead of increasing, during the period 1946-47 to1948-49. Although there were some reductions in fares during the period, thisdecline in unit revenue in the main reflects the progressive unattractiveness oiunsuitable aircraft in conditions of growing intensity of competition.
The foregoing conclusions on the major features of the Corporations&apos; efforts to increase output and productivity and reduce costs are summarised in thesUbjoined table : .Output, Productivity and Unit Costs in 1949-50 (1st half) : Percentage increase or Decrease on Average Rate in 1947-48AllB.O.A.C.

This, body was formed in 1946, to deal with remuneration,and conditions of service in the industry and to provide machinery of consultation in matters of efficiency, welfare, &amp;c. This machinery comprises a system of panelsof both sides of the industry, at appropriate levels, both, at the Headquarters andsubordinate establishments of the Corporation. Both Management and TradeUnions alike have co-operated to make the system a success and the smoothnesswith which the difficult problems of redundancy have been handled is a tribute to the relations which exist between the two sides of the Council. The T.U.C.in their summary of June 1949 of comments of the Trade Unions on the &quot; structure and Conduct of the Nationalised Industries &quot; draw attention to the unanimousview of the Unions that the consultative machinery of the Air Transport Corpora-tions is complete at all levels and is working with entire satisfaction.Standards of Management and General Levels of CostsBritish South American AirwaysB.S.A.A., from the outset, succeeded in operating at lower costs than theother Corporations. This Corporation had the advantage of operating from small beginnings not involving an elaborate organisation, untrammelled by anypast inheritance and only requiring the relatively small administrative overheadstructure associated with a small organisation. It faced a simpler task than theother Corporations in the spacing of its overseas staging points and stations, and expansion of overheads tended to lag behind expansion of activities. But in theearly years there was the frequent criticism of low standards of passengerhandling and &quot;shoe string&quot; operation of which the accident rate tended toprovide some evidence. In 1946-47 a special enquiry by the Air Safety board was made into the standards of operation of B.S.A.A. and, later, on the disappearance of the Star Tiger, the chief executive (Air Vice-Marshal Bennett)was dismissed. In more recent years, the standards of operation and passengerhandling have improved, but costs, although higher, are not excessive, bearing inmind the unavoidable inflation of staffs in preparation for an expanding Tudorservice which did not materialise.The position in the other two Corporations was altogether different. Both inB-0.A.C. and in British European Airways there were frequent criticisms ofextravagant methods and standards, which the not unsuccessful efforts to reduceCQsts and improve productivity did not allay. By the middle of 1948 it became apparent that efficiency with maximum economy was not being pursued with sufficient vigour either in B.O.A.C. or in British European Airways. A lack ofoost consciousness seemed to permeate the Corporations at all levels. Improve-ttent in output per employee was neither great enough nor fast enough. Even^fter making all allowances for the chronic handicaps of unsuitable aircraft anddispersed bases, output compared unfavourably with that of the most efficientforeign competitors. The circumstances of the two Corporations were somewhat different, although British European Airways, as the offspring, was manifestlyaffected by some of the vices of the parent B.O.A.C. in organisation, methods and
general attitude towards costs. The rate of overhead expenditure, particularly jnB.Q.A.C., was far too high.British Overseas AirwaysIn July 1948, within a few weeks of my taking office, B.O.A.C. announceda new form of organisation having as its primary object increased productivity and a reduction of the rate of overhead expenditure. I was not happy about this form of organisation, and I arranged, with the concurrence of the Chairman(then Sir Harold Hartley) that Sir Miles Thomas (then Deputy Chairman andChairman-elect) should be assigned the special responsibility, with which a seniorofficial of my Ministry would be associated, for implementing the organisationand conducting a simultaneous economy drive. Parliament was so informed inOctober 1948. Their examination of the position confirmed that a somewhat different type of organisation was more suited to the nature of the responsibilities and to the size of the fleets of the Corporation. When, shortly afterwards, inMarch 1949 the decision to merge B.O.A.C. and B.S.A.A. supervened, theopportunity was taken, following the necessary legislation in July 1949, to initiatethe organisational modifications to which I have alluded. This is being carriedout in two stages, in order to avoid disruption during a period of re-equipment of the combined Corporation, but the entire process will be completed during thecurrent year. This organisation was evolved in close consultation with me, andwas outlined in Parliament during the second reading of the Airways Corpora-tions Bill (the merger Bill). It abolishes the semi-autonomous geographicalDivisions, thus eliminating one tier at the higher levels and substitutes an organisation conceived on a functional basis with greater delegation of day-to-dayexecutive duties and a simplified and less top-heavy administration., Concurrently with these changes in the broad structure of the organisation,outside industrial consultants have been engaged on reviewing the detailedorganisation and methods of various key branches, and working parties were set in motion to review such matters as overseas allowances of staffs, and co-ordina-tion and reduction of surface transport fleets of the Corporations. substantial economies have already resulted and others are in prospect. Reports by outsideconsultants have already been received on the Supply and Accounting systems ofthe Corporation, and they estimate that the adoption of their recommendations in these fields should lead to economies of over  300,000 a year on administrationalone. Further reports are to follow from which it is expected that moreeconomies will result. I should add that the appointment of Sir Miles Thomasas Chairman from 1st July, 1949, has greatly increased the cost consciousness ofthe Corporation and the vigour with which economies are being pursued.In 1948 British European Airways, then under the Chairmanship ofMr. d&apos;Erlanger, also engaged a firm of industrial consultants (ProductionEngineering, Ltd.) to advise on the form of organisation and methods of theCorporation. I also arranged for another senior official of my Ministry to be associated with this review. A detailed system of budgetary control was intro-duced in 1948-49 enabling the management to determine accurately and promptlythe trend of expenditure and revenues, and to take any corrective action necessary,at an early stage. Methods were improved in many branches and adjustmentswere made in the organisation at the directing levels with the object of securing a wider measure of decentralisation. Whilst this review was in progress I found it necessary to make a change in the chairmanship and appointed Lord Douglasto the post in February 1949. The appointment was much criticised by theOpposition, but few will now dispute that Lord Douglas, as Chairman, andMr. Peter Masefield, who was appointed Chief Executive on my initiative, have provided a particularly strong and inspiring leadership. Substantial economies and reduced losses are now materialising, as described below, and represent thefirst fruits of the improvements of organisation and methods and changes of management.Results of the Ctirrent Year 1949-50Towards the end of 1948-49&apos;, when the first estimates for 1949-50 were underconsideration, energetic measures were in train to improve organisation and methods in B.O.A.C. and British European Airways and otherwise to effecteconomies.   The Viking aircraft had become operationally efficient in the service
0f British.European Airways, and the Corporation^ operations and maintenancewere now concentrated on Northolt and Renfrew. B.O.A.C. were to be re-equipped with their Stratocruisers, Canadairs and Hermes in 194&amp;-50, and the economydrive was expected to bear the first fruits. Viewing this prospect objectively,I: informed Parliament in February 1949 that I had set a target grant of. 5-5 million for the three Corporations for 1949-50, without retarding the normalexpansion of services. The figures for the individual Corporations were 3-5 million for B.O.A.C.,  1-5 million for British European Airways and  25 million for B.S.A.A; As I informed the House, these targets had been fixedbefore the disappearance of the Star Ariel and it remained to be seen &quot;what,if any, qualifications will be required. Even apart from the Tudor mishap, thereare bound to be factors beyond the control of the Corporations which may wellaffect this target being reached. There may be delays in the delivery of aircraft,running-in troubles, reductions in fares due to world competition, or failureof world traffic to live up to expectations. Any of these may make a big difference to the net financial result.&quot; Shortly after I spoke it was decided that the Tudor 4must be withdrawn from service; and most of these contingent reservations, in varying degrees, have unfortunately proved to be firm predictions. It will beimpossible, except in the case of British European Airways, to realise the targetfigures.The ascertained results of the Corporations for the period April to September1949 projected, with the necessary modifications, over the whole year, indicatethat the losses for 1949-50 are likely to aggregate  9-9 million, comprising:  (a) B.O.A.C. (excluding B.S.A.A. Division)    .....   6,600,000(b) B.S.A.A.       - ...      ...      ..........!      1,900,000(c) British European Airways     ...       .....   ...      1,400,000The total of  9 - 9 million compares with  9 - 7 million for 1948-49. No finalprecision can be attributed to these figures, but they appear to be on the conserva-tive side, and I hope that the ultimate result will not differ materially from thatof 1948-49. -The major factors which have led to this disappointing result are : (i) the disappearance of the Star Ariel and resultant withdrawal of the tudor 4 from service on B.SA.A. routes;(ii) extra costs arising from revaluation; and(iii) delays in the delivery of aircraft.Of these factors the withdrawal of the Tudor 4 from service has proved themost serious. Its affect on the commercial results of B.S.A.A. has been almostcatastrophic. The deficit of  250,000 expected for B.S.A.A. in December 1948is likely to be exceeded by  1,750,000. It became necessary to reintroduce Yorksand Lancastrians to replace some of the Tudor capacity planned for progressiveintroduction during the year on an expanding route system. Those outmodedand uneconomic aircraft have failed to hold their traffic in competition withforeign airlines equipped with modern American types.From the moment I found myself compelled to ground the Tudors it became clear that the effects of the commercial results of the Corporation would be serious,and in August 1949 the loss was estimated at  1-25 million. A revised estimateshowing the full magnitude of the loss now likely to be incurred, only reachedme immediately after Christmas, but even if I had been aware earlier of thefull extent of the, probable losses, no courses, other than those taken, would havebeen open to me. I have considered at various times during the last year, inconsultation with the Corporation, the possibility of suspending South Americanservices until the Argonauts and Constellations became available, but I havebeen, and am still, sure that this course would not only be inexpedient, but would show little, if any, economy during the short period of months before the new types can replace the Yorks and Lancastrians. No appreciable savings could bemade to set against the disruption and expense which would be caused by with-drawing local organisations and terminating business arrangements and reintro-ducing them after a short period. Commercial rights of operation in foreigncountries, in some cases obtained and retained with difficulty, might create a major problem on resumption of services.38196 1      c 2
Accordingly, I have turned my mind over a period to the possibility of per.manent curtailment of effort on South American routes, but, after very full discussion with B.O.A.C., I am assured that, given competitive aircraft, these routes can be commez-cially justified. The routes all figured in the planneddevelopment of the original British South American Airlines, formed to operate as a private company, without subsidy assistance, before the Government came into power. A current assessment by the Corporation of future commercial prospectsbased on the experience of the past four years, tends to support the judgment ofthe pioneers. The Caribbean area is the third largest traffic generating area inthe world and the Central and South American Republics originate a considerablevolume of air traffic. Hence, I consider that existing plans for developing south american routes should proceed with the new types of aircraft procured &quot;for thepurpose.Effects of RevaluationRevaluation has provided another source of unexpected addition to the losses of the Corporations. Higher costs of fuel and overseas stations in the hard currency countries, together with spares requirements in support of Americantype aircraft, have increased expenditure. This increase of expenditure is onlypartly offset by increase of dollar earnings. In the result, B.O.A.C. (includingB.S.A.A. Division) estimates a net addition of  600,000 to the loss in 1949-50.This figure is likely to increase to  1 million in a full year. The increased net costof revaluation to B.E.A. for the current year is  230,000 or  450,000 in a full year.Delays in Delivery of A ircraftFinally, further delays in the delivery of the Stratocruisers and the HandleyPage Hermes have occurred. The delivery of the Stratocruisers did not commenceuntil October 1949 and the first aircraft entered into service in December 1949.Although completion of delivery of the twenty-five Handley Page Hermes by december 1949 was promised last May, on a revised forecast, the aircraft has notyet undergone its C. of A. trials. Whilst it is reasonable to assume that deliverywill take place in 1950-51, the whole fleet of aircraft are unlikely to be effectively in service until late in that year. It must also be borne in mind that this is a relatively untried aircraft which has not yet been flown by any other airline.Delay in the delivery of aircraft, not only precludes the retirement of uneconomictypes with all their disadvantages of costly maintenance and operation and lowearning capacity, but expenditure on all the preparatory work of training of crewsand maintenance staffs becomes premature and represents an expensive assetearning no revenue until the aircraft are delivered and enter into service. Thecost of conversion training of crews alone will cost B.O.A.C. about  1 million in 1949-50.When, last autumn, clear signs appeared of the likely results for 1949-50,I informed Sir Miles Thomas that I was seriously concerned about the continuinghigh rate of overheads and that, in spite of efforts already made, the pace of staffreductions was too slow. I pressed for further and more rapid reductions of staff,to which the acceleration of the new form of organisation might be expected tocontribute. Sir Miles Thomas, who had only become Chairman in July and hadnot previously enjoyed plenary^ powers, acted with promptitude. He issued a directive to every unit of the Corporation, at home and overseas, calling forproposals for a 10 per cent, reduction of staffs additional to the redundanciesarising from changes in the organisation. The final results are not yet to hand,but the reduction from 18,920 on 1st April, 1949 to 17,300 on 31st January, 1950,indicates that a good deal has already been accomplished, and I may add an impression that this is the first among many real and alleged reorganisations olB.O.A.C. in which the pruning has affected high- and low-level staffs alike.By contrast with this chequered tale of B.O.A.C. and B.S.A.A.,the results ofBritish European Airways are most encouraging and, indeed, provide a valuableyardstick by which the policy of the Government may be judged. This Corpora-tion, moreover, is faced with the difficult problem of providing internal air transport in the United Kingdom, including the provision, in accordance with government policy, of a number of social services which are inherently uneconomicThe present management, under the Chairmanship of Lord Douglas, has maderapid progress in the past year. Starting with a target grant of  1,535,000 for1949-50, which the previous management thought unattainable, it now seems
probable that the ultimate loss for the year will be well within this figure, notwith-standing the additional costs due to revaluation. For the period April to september 1949, the Corporation loss was only  84,466. This period, of course,covers the peak season when revenues and aircraft utilisation are at their highest,but this remarkable result compares with a loss of  1,039,000 in the correspondingperiod of the previous year. The much improved results for 1949-50 beartestimony to the fact that successful commercial operation is dependent oncompetitive aircraft, concentration of maintenance and operations and a soundorganisation, combined with a management zealous in its pursuit of economy andenterprising in its sales policy. In B.E.A. all these requirements are now present,and the prospects for the future are an encouraging endorsement of the policyof the Government.forecast for the future to predict the future is a risky undertaking. I am, however, convinced of the soundness of the original White Paper policy. I am confident that B.O.A.C.and B.S.A.A. will produce materially improved results from 1950-51 onwards.The Argonauts are now established on the Empire routes, the ten Stratocruiserswill be in service on the North Atlantic during the year, the Constellations will be operating the routes to the Caribbean and Central America and the Argonautsthe South Atlantic service to Buenos Aires. The Hermes 4 is the only uncertainquantity and the 25 aircraft of this type are required for final replacement on theEmpire routes of Yorks, Lancastrians and expensive medium-sized flying boats.It would be pessimistic, however, to visualise any further setback which woulddelay the entry of the aircraft into service beyond 1950-51.The new organisation of the Corporation is being introduced progressivelyand will be completed in the early part of 1950, whilst the economy drive, both toreduce numbers of personnel and improve productivity, should yield satisfactory-results. It is true that the year 1950-51 is still a year of re-equipment involvingnon-recurrent expense. Compared with anterior years, revaluation will increasedeficits by approximately  1 million. Salary and wage increases have to someextent offset staff reductions and, if this trend should be renewed and pressure for reduced and tourist fares is maintained, the difficulties will naturally beincreased.Nevertheless I am confident that, if all goes well, the present management of B.O.A.C., under the direction of Sir Miles Thomas, will achieve a substantial improvement in 1950-51. I consider it important that close consultation at thehighest level between the Ministry and the Corporations which has been animportant feature of the past year should continue until B.O.A.C. (includingB.S.A.A.) can settle down. The first estimates of the Corporation for 1950-51,disclosing a loss of  5-3 million, have just been received but have not yet been examined and finally settled. The estimates for British European Airways havenot yet been submitted, but I have made provision tentatively for a grant of 1-25 million. The resultant total of  6-5 million compares with a probabledeficit for 1949-50 of about  9-7 million.After 1950-51 I would not predict actual figures, but the period from1951-52 onwards should witness progressively declining deficits and progressivelyexpanding services and traffics for the British Corporations.General ConclusionWhilst the emphasis of this survey has necessarily been placed on the causes of the continuing high losses of the Corporations and the factors which banishedfte justifiable optimism that 1949-50 would mark the turn of the tide, the storylsby no means one of unrelieved gloom. In the space of just over four years, the corporations have built up an air transport industry second only to that of theUnited States in size and have re-established and developed a world-wide networkQf routes covering 90,000 miles and offering 13 million ton miles of capacity per month. Pre-war figures are not strictly comparable, but the combined B.O.A.C.-&amp;S.A.A. scale of effort is approximately five times as great as that of imperial airways before the war. In addition, the Corporations have gained acknowledgedleadership in standards of operation, safety and passenger service and have pro-pessively reduced costs, improved productivity and expanded output. All thisnas been achieved against a general trend of rising costs in an industry where, attne end of 1949, prices (fare levels) show only an advance of about 35 per cent, on
pre-war levels, compared with wholesale price advances of 125 per cent, and rail-way fare increases of 55 per cent.The defects of organisation and overstaffing of the Corporations are due inno small measure, to rapidity of expansion with only a nucleus, at the outset&apos;of trained administrative and directing staffs. Conditions in the initial (post-war)years were abnormal, and future growth, for which expanding provision fell tobe made, was difficult to predict. These defects are noAv being vigorously tackledunder the present direction of the Corporations. B.O.A.C. staffs were reduced from 22,949 to 18,920 between 1st April, 1946, and 31st March, 1949, and will bestill further reduced to 17,300 by 31st January, 1950.The bulk of the losses must be attributed to deliberate acts of policy and, inparticular, to the aircraft policy with its unforeseen corollary of the Tudor sa^a.But this policy was universally endorsed and as a result, the British aircraftmanufacturing industry essential in war and an important contributor to theexport trade in peace finds itself in a position of strength and promise whichwould not have been possible if our Corporations had been allowed to compete on equal terms with their competitors in the purchase of foreign aircraft. The ordersfor British civil aircraft have made an important contribution to the potential ofthe industry and, hence, to the value of aircraft exports which, for military and civil types, amounted to  31,327,000 in the first eleven months of 1949. (Decemberfigures not yet available.) The de Havilland Comet, the world&apos;s first four-enginedjet airliner, has no rival in its striking advance on contemporary types. this aircraft has already considerably enhanced the prestige of the British aircraft industry and should place it in a position of undeniable leadership. The Comet,together with the Viscount and Ambassador, should provide a substantial addi-tion to our aircraft exports in the years to come. Equipped with such aircraft the natural advantages already enjoyed by our air transport industry will assertthemselves, and it is these long term rewards which provide the iustification of past losses and the complete vindication of the policy of the White Paper of1945.IV.-AERODROMES AND GROUND ORGANISATION POLICYAND ACHIEVEMENTSBy far the greatest number of the staff in my Ministry and its outstations,indeed 90 per cent of the whole is engaged on the administration of the groundservices. Civil Aviation before the war was a young and rapidly expandingbranch of the world&apos;s transport, but during the war its expansion was artificiallyarrested. In 1938, the last complete pre-war year, the number of &quot; international&quot;passengers using our airports was 176,049. In 1946. the first complete post-war year, the number was 433,185, in 1947, 758,806, in 1948, 918,798, and in 1949 thefinal calculation will probably show a million.The greatly increased numbers of passengers and the demands of the far larger and faster aircraft which carry them raise problems all over the country of passenger handling, of runways, hangars and workshops, and of air traffic controltele-communications and radio and radar aids to navigation, landing and takeoff.These problems are handled partly on the spot by the aerodrome staffs, partly by delegation at the four Divisional Headquarters, and partly at the Ministryitself1 where policy is framed.This may be called our positive contribution to civil aviation and the resultswe achieve bear comparison with those of any other country on earth.A erodromesThe policy of the present Government in regard to airfields was set out itparagraphs 19-24 of the Command Paper (Cmd. 6712) entitled ft British MServices &quot; published in December 1945. Briefly, it is that transport airfield5required for scheduled air services shall be acquired and managed by the MinisWof Civil Aviation. In pursuit of this policy the Ministry has so far assumeddirect operation of thirty-four civil aerodromes.These State-operated aerodromes fall naturally into two classes (a) The  big   aerodromes   required   for   international   services-LondoftNortholt, Prestwick and a few others which are being developedinternational standards, and

This country hastaken a leading part in international discussions on standardisation both ofjystems and of equipment, and improved British radio and radar equipment istaing developed to replace American equipment.Radar surveillance of aircraft using the Metropolitan Zone is exercising aP^found effect on control and in the best cirumstances we can monitor the flightof an aircraft up to distances of 130 miles from London Airport.(b) Aerodromes which are required for internal services, most of which(particularly in Scotland) are used to provide essential public services,and only some of them for services which should become commerciallyself-supporting.Our immediate policy for the second class of aerodrome and our plans for thefuture must take account not only of the traffic offering and anticipated, but also of the progress in development of the helicopter, which may well prove the most economical form of air transport for flights of a limited, length, and may thereforerender unnecessary the expensive runways called for by &quot; fixed wing &quot; services.&apos;Progress at London Airport has been most impressive. The passengerhandling organisation we have built up in the temporary &apos;&apos; compound &apos;&apos; along theBath Road has been astonishingly successful and London Airport can challengecomparison with any on either side of the Atlantic.The immense job of creating the dual triangular runway system, including the&apos;tunnels into the central area and the diversion of two rivers, is making greatstrides and our plans envisage London beginning to take over traffic fromNortholt early in 1951 and absorbing the whole of Northolt&apos;s traffic during 1954.Work will shortly be starting on the permanent hangars, but we have delayedconstruction of the permanent terminal buildings to allow us to accumulateexperience on the needs of a first-class international airport of the future.In the meantime traffic trends are being constantly watched so that we maybe ready, if necessary, to start yet further extensions at London Airport, north of the Bath Road, in time to be always at least a jump ahead of the traffic.The other Transatlantic Airport, Prestwick, has also been kept abreast of requirements and, for example, the main runway has been strengthened to enable it to take the Stratocruiser. which in future will carry the great bulk of the traffic across the Atlantic.That our policy has been justified is shown by the results. While the actualnumber of aircraft of all kinds using our airports has not varied greatly overthe last three years, we have accommodated much larger aircraft and a very mucngreater number of passengers.A comparison of traffic between the five months April-August in the years1947, 1948 and 1949 at the three international airports, shows the followingadvances : 
Simultaneously, with the willing co-operation of the Service Departments, \yeare introducing a system of airways, whereby along certain lanes and between certain heights, aircraft flying over this country can be positively controlled fromthe ground in order to minimise risk of collision.All these problems are intensified, not only by the actual increase in ajrtraffic, but also by the size and speed of the new aircraft which are constantlybeing added to the civil air fleets of the world, and the insistent demands by the operators for safety and regularity. To add urgency to our plans for keepingabreast of developments is the stimulating factor of jet propulsion, making itnecessary to restate some of our most basic assumptions. The advent of the jet aircraft, flying at high speeds and altitudes hitherto unexplored, creates newproblems of air traffic control, meteorological forecasting and operationaltechniques. These problems of the future add to the heavy and continuousresponsibility on my Department and I am glad to say that they are being facedwith energy and enthusiasm.

Operating deficit is the difference between operating expenditure and operating revenue on air Transport Services. Net deficit is operating deficit plus net non-operating expenditure. Thelatter includes, inter alia, interest, Board fees, loss (or profit) on other Aerial Work and losses ofsubsidiary and associated Companies.Net Deficits and Grants, 1946-472. The figures quoted are as published in the Corporations&apos; Annual Reports and Accounts for1946-47. As the result of subsequent adjustments to deficits the grants, which for 1946^47 were on a deficiency basis, had at 31st March, 1949, been revised as follows: -Net deficit Grant   B.O.A.C.............      8,737,000 8,737,000B.E.A.............      2,129,000 2,129,000Some further adjustments to the grants for 1946-47 have still to be agreed.B.O.A.C.3- Comparable financial data for B.O.A.C. in 1945-46 are not available, owing to the waiverarrangements applying to certain revenue and expenditure.4. The increase in net deficit for the period April-September 1949 as compared with April-September 1948, is almost wholly due to a net increase in non-operating expenditure.B-S.A.A.5. The 1946-47 figures are for the full year, April 1946 to March 1947, and include the operations01 B.S.A.A., Ltd., in the period, April to July 1946.B.E.A.. *!:  The figures for 1946-47 are for the eight months, August 1946 to March 1947 only.   ThePril-September results should not be taken as typical of the full year&apos;s results, on account of thee.re contraction of traffic normal in the winter months,g   &apos; The figures for April-September 1948, unavoidably include in Operating Revenue and gPj^jiture the revenue and expenditure on Other Aerial Work.   It is estimated that approximately^00 of revenue and expenditure is attributable to Other Aerial Work.

The increase in net deficit per C.T.M. in April-September 1949, as compared with April-- September 1948, is due to an increase in net non-operating expenditure.   The operating deficit percent.T.M. fell from 14-3 to 12-1 pence.B.S.A.A.2.   The large decrease in operating expenditure in April-September 1949 as compared withApril-September 1948, reflects intensive flying on the Berlin Airlift.B.E.A.3.   The April-September results should not be taken as typical of the full year&apos;s results on accountof the severe contraction of traffic normal in the winter months.4.
