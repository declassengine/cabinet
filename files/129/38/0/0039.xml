These circulars include, among other things,  (a) instructions as to the earmarking of premiseswhich would be required in war for civil defence purposes(wardens1 posts, rescue depots, ambulance stations, fire ;stations, rest centres, etc.) and (b) instructions as to thepreparation of detailed local plans for the evacuation of school children, etc.  and for dealing with persons madehomeless by enemy action.      The circulars at present in contemplation do not deal with such questions as the pro-vision of air raid shelters or other structural precautions.2. The circulars may well attract some publicity andthe Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence decided in January(with the approval of the Prime Minister) that they shouldnot be issued until after the General Election.3. At a meeting on 15th March (C. D. (M) (50) 2nd Meeting,Minute 2) the Committee reviewed the position and. came to theconclusion that the proper course is to proceed nov/ with theIssue of these circulars.      It is not thought likely that thiswill lead to any misapprehension as to the imminence of warand, if it should do so,  it will be easy enough to correct it by a statement in the House of Commons.4. The Committee asked me to report this conclusion tothe Cabinet and to seek authority for the departmental ministers to proceed accordingly.C. E.Home Office, S.W.1,16T.H MARCH,  1950.
