CABINETRETAIL POOD PRICE increases memorandum by the. Minister of PoodIn view of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 23rd Marchabout the timing of the price increases recommended in cp.(50) 46 (CM.(50) lUth Conclusions, Minute 5), I thoughtmy colleagues would like to have my views,  which are as follows;-2&quot; The buttor ration may be taken up at any time during a four-week ration period.    So as to avoid inequitable treatmentof consumers who take up their ration late in the period, wemust therefore arrange for any price increase to operate fromthe beginning of the period,  i.c.  on 23rd April,  or dates atfour-weekly intervals thereafter.    As butter is issued togrocers on an eight-weekly perr.it,  it will be preferable to effect a price increase at the beginning of a permit period,that is to say the next suitable date after 23rd April is l8thJune,  not 21st May.3. If wo are to got the benefit of the increased price for the first month in which the retail cons amor is going topay it, and if wo are to avoid making a fortuitous present tothe grocers, we must increase wholesale prices sufficientlyin advance of the retail price increase to allow distributionof stocks to grocers at the new price.h. It would just be possible,  if the pirice of butterwore to be increased with effect from 23rd April,   to delay the announcement until 19th April.5. The bacon ration has  to be taken up separately each,week,  so that an increase can be effected at the beginning ofany week,  but to meet the  requirements of the system of controloperated by my Department,  the announcement of a retail price increase &quot;must come at least ten days before it comes into force,and the preparations for an increase must begin a month inadvance.    In paragraph 13 of CP.-(50)&apos; US I recommend that theprice increases for butter and bacon should be announced togetherS. On the assumption of a combined announcement on19th April,  the  earliest practicable date for an increasein the price of bacon would bo 30th April.    Subject to theagreement of my colleagues to  the proposals in CP.(30) M6,I therefore recommend, that the announcement of the price increases bo made on 19th April,  and that the increasestake effect on 23rd April for butter and 30th April for bacon.7. This proposed time-table has the further advantage that it will coincide with an increase in the butter rationto 3 o:;s. which I shall probably propose to make  on23rd April.    Such a ration increase might help to mitigateCOPY NO.   - 2--(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVSRNhENT)SECRETCP. (50), 502hTH MARCH,  1950

the effect of the announce merit of the price increase.    Thetemporary bacon ration of 5 ozs., on the other band, &quot;cannotbo maintained much longer,  and I shall probably have toreduce it to h. ozs. once more on the same date.G. In paragraph 8 of C.P.(50) 46,  I have explainedwhy we shall not be able to save the full  18.7 millions which the price increases might be expected to produce in afull year.    The actual saving,  assuming that my recommendations are approved, will be  12 millions for butter and  5*5 millions for bacon,  a total of  17*5 millions.Ministry of Food, S.W.I.,21+TH MARCh,   1950.
