DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 11422nd October, I960COPY NO.f   &apos;2milCABINETTHE CONCORDE CRITERIA;  THE NEXT STEPMemorandum by the Attorney-general it may be helpful to make an assessment of our legal positionfollowing the negotiations that have taken place between the Ministerof Technology and M. Chamant.2.      In paragraph 11 of his memorandum (C(68) 109) the Minister of technology asks whether acceptance of M. Chamant&apos;s proposals would improve our position, worsen it, or leave things much as they are.    Asthe Minister points out, the French proposals fall short of our objective of establishing a strategy of withdrawal under which, in agreement withthe French, if certain criteria were not met, we would be free to withdrawunilaterally,    I consider first the effect of the proposals.The Chamant proposals and the Cabinet objectives compared3,       The proposals fall short of our objective in the following respects.4,      As to the first criterion, airline orders.    If we have not achievedthe order criterion (orders from four major airlines including at least one American airline) by the end of 1969, but there still remains a hopeof orders, Ivl. Chamant proposes not that we should be entitled to withdraw,but that Ministers should discuss the continuance of the project based on a comparison of prospects and increased cost and time scales.    This is notthe firm break-point v/e sought.    Nevertheless it establishes for the first time a reference point in relation to which a decision on the continuation of the project is to be taken based on commercial prospects.    If there isno prospect of orders the project is to be terminated;  if there is a prospect of orders, but at increased cost and time, the two ministers will discuss the continuance of the project on its merits.5,       As to the second, estimated development cost exceeding  600million.    Ministers wished us to be in a position to withdraw unilaterallywithout paying damages as soon as it became apparent that  600 million would be exceeded.     The French memorandum requires us to wait untilthe end of 1969, and if it then appears that  600 million will be exceeded,Ministers will propose to their respective Governments an amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding of 1962 allowing each Governmentto be released from any automatic obligation to continue the projectjointly - paragraph 2d,    This falls short of the break-point v/e sought in two particular respects.    In the first place it commits us until theend of 1969, and in the second it does not give us an agreed right of unilateral withdrawal.    However if the French Government refused-1-
to accept a recommendation of their Minister to release us when the time came and we then withdrew unilaterally our position in the international court would be strengthened by the fact that the responsible french minister had recognised that in the circumstances envisaged thesituation would have so changed that each party should be released from its obligation to continue.The Chamant proposals (course (v))6,      In making an assessment of whether we would be better or worse off by accepting the French proposals I leave out of account the politicaland other considerations referred to at the end of the Minister of technology&apos;s memorandum and deal only with our legal position.First, how far would v/e be worse off07.      In my memorandum of 27th June, 1966 (C(66) 90), I dealt withthe legal principles which govern the right of a party to withdraw froman agreement on the ground of a fundamental change of circumstances.The first question to be considered is whether, by agreeing to the french proposals, we deprive ourselves of the right to invoke those principles.On one view, if parties to an agreement prescribe a procedure to befollowed in a specified situation they are contractually bound to follow that procedure if the specified situation arises.    So far as cost isconcerned we will have agreed upon a procedure.    If we sought beforethe International Court to rely upon the increase of cost as constituting a fundamental change, the Court might hold that, having agreed upon a procedure whereby we might be discharged from an obligation which wehad acknowledged to be an automatic obligation, we were required tofollow that procedure.    We would not of course be debarred frominvoking the defence of fundamental change of circumstances if thefundamental change fell outside the situation specified in the agreement,as for example a major design failure.    On the other hand, it could be argued that the French proposals do not affect the right of unilateralwithdrawal in the event of a fundamental change of circumstances, since this is a right every party to an agreement has as a matter of internationallaw.    It is by no means certain that this view would prevail but neverthelesthe existence of I/i, Chamant&apos;s proposals itself lends strong support to thisproposition, for his proposals recognise that in certain circumstances thefuture of the project will be called into question.     There is a risk that ifv/e try to improve upon our position under those proposals v/e shall lose the advantage of that recognition,8.      If it be the case that we could be regarded as depriving ourselvesof the right to rely on cost increase as constituting a fundamental changeof circumstances entitling us to withdraw unilaterally we could be said tobe losing something by agreeing to the French proposals.    But we must make an assessment of the value of that right.    It is precisely becauseof the difficulty, looked at in the light of the history and nature of the project, of determining at what point increase in cost constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances that v/e decided to try and agree a limit with the French,    I do not know whether, during the next 15 months,the pattern of cost increase is likely to differ materially from the patternthat has emerged in the past.    Unless there is a significant worsening ofthe situation between now and the end of 1969 there will be no point at whichthe Law Officers will be able to advise that increase in cost constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances giving us a right of unilateral
withdrawal (I refer to this further in paragraph 12 below).    We must not therefore be under any illusions as to the practical value of this right,9.      How much, on the other hand, would v/e have gained if we accepted the French proposals ?    We v/ould have gained theiracknowledgment of two criteria by which, as the Minister of Technologysays, the continuing validity of the project is to be judged.    Thisacknowledgment is clearly of value, but the value of that acknowledgmentmust be judged in the light of what the French propose should happen ifthe criteria are not met.    So far as airline orders are concerned theposition will be, not that we can withdraw (unless of course no orders are in prospect), but that discussion will open on the lines envisaged by M. Chamant,    If the French were minded to prolong these discussionsthey could drag on during 1970 and meanwhile expenditure v/ould continueunabated.    As for an increase in the cost estimate over  600 million,here again we cannot withdraw forthwith.    What is proposed is that an amendment to the 1962 Agreement should be negotiated allowing each government to be released from an automatic obligation to continue,and again the possibility of delay in negotiating an amendment cannotbe ruled out.10,       The French might, for instance, propose an amendment whereby,although there was no automatic obligation to continue, the Governmentwhich withdrew should pay the other Government^ cancellation chargesif the other Government decided that it could not continue alone.    were/ould not be obliged to accept an amendment in those terms, but thereis clearly the possibility of delay.    The risk of delay arising in thisway could be avoided if the Minister of Technology were to secureM, Chamant&apos;s agreement that it would not be necessary to go throughthe procedure of amending the 1962 Agreement, but that it v/ould besufficient for each Government simply to release the other.    This is what the Minister of Technology originally proposed (paragraph 9 ofhis memorandum).     It does not touch upon the substance of the matter,but only the procedure.    In paragraph 2b of his proposals (no prospectof orders;  project to be terminated) M. Chamant makes no mention ofan amendment to the 1962 Agreement, and if a formal procedure is unnecessary for abandonment on the ground of lack of orders, it shouldbe equally unnecessary for abandonment on the ground of cost,11,       Whether or not, however, we seek to improve upon our positionin this respect, acceptance of the French proposals would in my viewrepresent a helpful gain.    We v/ould have secured their acknowledgmentthat continuance of the project was to be judged in the light of thecommercial prospects of the aircraft,   depending on the airline orderscriterion and the cost criterion of  600 million.    Should it happen thatat the end of 1969 the criteria were not satisfied but only marginally not satisfied, we might feel that we would show ourselves in an unreasonablelight if we did not agree to continue with the project.    Those criteriawould remain, however, as an agreed yardstick by which the advisability of continuing with the project should be judged,   V/e could make it clear,if we agreed to continue, that we regarded the falling short in achieving the criteria as marginal only and that the significance of the criteriaremained.    On balance, for the reasons I have given above, I think we would be better off by accepting the French proposals than byrejecting them.    At least our commitment v/ould no longer be completelyopen-ended,
Course (iv)12.      I now consider what our legal position would be if we took course(iv).    What we would be doing would be to lay down a criterion unilatei-ally,that if the cost estimate exceeded  600 million at any time before the endof 1969, we would feel free to withdraw.    The question comes down tothis.    Are v/e as a matter of law entitled to invoke the principlesreferred to in paragraph 7 above, alleging that an increase in thecost estimate above  600 million amounts to a fundamental changeof circumstances ?    Here I find myself in difficulty upon an issue of fact.    On the one hand the  600 million figure is spoken of as a figurethat is likely to be reached in any event, and the middle or autumn of1969 is spoken of as the likely date.    On the other hand, it is spoken of as a figure that represents a situation of crises involving a majorredesign;  a fundamental change of circumstances in other words.From the point of view of our legal position this is a critical issueof fact,    Y/hether v/e v/ould succeed in proceedings instituted by theFrench before the International Court in consequence of our unilateralwithdrawal must remain a matter of uncertainty, because of the difficultyof satisfying the Court that an increase above any particular figurerepresents a fundamental change of circumstances,Possible variant of course (v)13,      In the middle of page 5 of his memorandum, the Minister of technology gives an account of the misgivings that were expressed atthe meeting of the Ministerial V/orking Group and as to the means wherebythey might perhaps be met.    The letter which it is proposed should besent in reply to M, Chamant is at Annex D to the Minister!s memorandum.I cannot advise that, as it stands, the letter is effective to achieve its purpose;  if it were to be effective to do so it would have to be made moreexplicit.    The disadvantage which may attach to making it more explicitis that it may in the process become difficult to distinguish from course(iv).    This disadvantage might be avoided by talcing a middle course ofmaking it clear that agreement to course (v) is without prejudice to theright of the parties in international law to terminate where there is afundamentally altered situation.    The question whether such an approachv/ould unduly involve the risk of a retraction by the French from theirpresent position and the consequential loss of the advantage of havinggot the two criteria acknowledged is a question of policy and tactics,not a question of lav/,F.E.
