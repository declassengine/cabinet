NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION AND SOCIAL INSURANCEPROPOSALS FOR EARNINGS-RELATED SOCIAL SECURITYIntroduction1. The Government are proposing the most fundamental changes in social security since the present national insurance scheme was introduced soon after the Second World War.2. The present scheme is clearly inadequate. Nearly 30 per cent of allpensioners are dependent in some degree on supplementary benefit. Theexisting flat-rate scheme has failed, despite the effort made in 1961 to shoreit up by introducing an element of graduated contribution and pension. Andthe extent of this failure will grow unless drastic steps are taken toreconstruct the whole system.3. This White Paper sets out the Government^ proposals for replacing the present national insurance scheme by a new scheme of national super-annuation and social insurance, in which both contributions and benefits willbe related to the earnings of the individual employee. The new earnings-related contributions will mostly be higher than the present-scheme contribu-tions, especially for higher earners. But those who pay the new contributions will earn new and higher personal pensions and other benefits personalin two particular senses. First, national superannuation pensions will be related to the individual^ personal earnings record; the uniform flat-ratepension will go. Secondly, unlike pension rights under most private super-annuation schemes, those under national superannuation will never be lost,however many times or for whatever reason the individual changes his job.4. The new earnings-related pensions and other benefits will only be avail-able to those who have paid the new contributions. Twenty years of new-scheme contributions will be required before the first pensions at the fullnew-scheme rates are paid to people reaching pension age then. These fullrates will normally be adequate, even for those whose earnings have beenrelatively low, to live on without other means. Contributors who reachpension age during the twenty-year build-up period will earn pensions atintermediate rates. As more and more people draw the higher pensions which they will have earned by their new-scheme contributions, the propor-tion of pensioners needing supplementary benefit will gradually decline.5. The new earnings-related pensions will not be available to those who arepensioners already. But existing pensioners will continue to share in thenation&apos;s rising living standards, through periodical increases in their pensions.The rate to be paid to present-scheme pensioners when the new scheme startswill be decided by the Government at the time.6. The income of the new scheme will automatically rise as earnings rise.This buoyancy will help to make possible a new guarantee covering pensionsand other benefits already in payment. The Government will be requiredby law to undertake a review every two years of the main rates of benefits
in payment, both under the present scheme and under the new. the increases made will, as a minimum, compensate for any rise in prices duringthe two-year period. The amounts of increases beyond this will be decided by the Government of the day, in the light of the general situation on each occasion.7. The Government have already introduced, in 1966, earnings-related short-term benefits for the first six months of sickness, unemployment andwidowhood. Thus the most fundamental changes now proposed concernpensions and other long-term benefits. They are based upon broad prin-ciples formulated in &quot; National Superannuation &quot;, published by the LabourParty in 1967. The Governments proposals are set out in this White paper for public comment and debate, and to serve as a basis of consultationwith both sides of industry and with organisations having a special interestin these matters. The Government plan to introduce legislation in the next session of Parliament, and to start the scheme as soon as possible afterwards.The target date is April 1972.8. Part I of this White Paper explains why the present national insurancescheme has failed to provide adequate pensions (chapter 1). Part II sets out the Governments basic objectives under the new scheme (chapter 2);describes the scheme&apos;s main features (chapter 3) ; and gives the Govern-menfs reasons for rejecting two alternative approaches to pension reform greater &quot; selectivity &quot;, and reliance on occupational pension schemes (chapter4). Part III deals with the State scheme&apos;s relations with occupational schemes (chapters 5 and 6), and Part IV with the financial and economic implications of the new scheme (chapter 7). Appendix 1 contains some further notes on particular aspects of the scheme. Appendix 2 contains amemorandum by the Government Actuary on the finance of the proposals.
part chapter 1THE NEED FOR change the financial position of pensioners today9. There are about 7,000,000 peopleC) drawing national insurance pensionstoday. Until the middle 1960s, comprehensive information on the financialposition of pensioners (apart from those receiving national assistance) waslacking, although independent research had provided evidence(2) that a sub-stantial number were entitled to receive national assistance but had notapplied for it. This evidence was confirmed by a survey which was carriedout in 1965 by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance with theco-operation of the National Assistance Board(3). This survey indicated that while about 1,450,000 pensioners were being helped by national assist-ance. there were about a further 850,000 who could have qualified for some payment of assistance at that time but had not applied and of these roughly300,000 were living appreciably below national assistance standards. the survey also showed that a very large number were only just above national assistance levels. If those levels had been  2 a week higher, about three-quarters of all pensioners would have been within the scope of national assistance.10. Since 1965 the Government have done much to improve the positionof elderly people, by pension increases and in other ways. The new supple-mentary benefits scheme, which replaced national assistance in 1966, hasincreased the minimum standard of living guaranteed by the State ; andmany more people have been persuaded to claim. There are now about,000,000 national insurance pensioners dependent in some degree on supple-mentary benefit over half a million more than benefited from national assistance. The supplementary benefits scheme has therefore improved thefinancial position of many of the poorest pensioners. But it cannot helpthose who are above supplementary benefit levels even by only a fewshillings. The rate rebate scheme which was introduced in 1966 broughtextra help in its first year to some 800,000 elderly householders, coveringabout a million elderly people in all. Some of them were previously livingbelow supplementary benefit levels ; others had incomes only slightly higher.The extension of local authority rent rebate schemes has also benefited a(!) This and other figures quoted in this chapter count a married couple as two, where bothare over pension age and retired.(2) &quot; The Economic Circumstances of Old People &quot; by Dorothy Cole with J.

283number of the poorest. There has thus been a definite improvement in the lot of elderly people most in need. But it is still true that most pensionershave incomes around, or not far above, supplementary benefit levels.11. Nearly a third of all pensioners are widows. This is the poorest groupamong the elderly. Nearly half of these widows receive supplementary benefit compared with about a fifth of other pensioners. It is likely that, ifthe level of supplementary benefit were raised by  1 a week, well over 80 percent of widow pensioners over 60 would be eligible for it.12. It is estimated that about half the total income of pensioners comes from national insurance pensions and supplementary benefits, and that theiraverage income is around two-thirds of that of the rest of the population(counting children as a half). The general standard of living of pensionersis therefore substantially below that of the working population.The Beveridge plan13. How has it happened that the present scheme of national insurance,founded on the principles of the Beveridge Report(1), fails to provide anadequate income in retirement? In 1948 the Report seemed a great step forward for Britain and a model for many other countries. Our &quot; WelfareState &quot; became more comprehensive than that of any other country. Virtuallythe whole population was covered by national insurance and by the national health Service.14. The Beveridge plan was &quot; first and foremost, a plan of insurance ofgiving in return for contributions benefits up to subsistence level, as of right and without means test, so that individuals may build freely upon it &quot;(2).It was based firmly on the contributory principle : benefits had to be earned.&quot; Benefit in return for contributions &quot;, Beveridge wrote, &quot; rather than freeallowances from the State, is what the people of Britain desire . . . Paymentof a substantial part of the cost of benefit as a contribution irrespective of the means of the contributor is the firm basis of a claim to benefitirrespective of means &quot;(3). It was based also on the principle of insurance in the sense that risks had to be pooled. &quot; Each individual should stand inon the same terms ; none should claim to pay less because he is healthieror has more regular employment &quot;(*). Social insurance &quot; implies a pooling of risks except so far as separation of risks serves a social purpose &quot;(5).15. The aim of the plan was &quot; to make want under any circumstancesunnecessary &quot;(c). Beveride condemned the inadequacy of the benefit pro-vided by earlier social insurance schemes. The remedy he proposed wasto improve social insurance &quot; in three directions : by extension of scope tocover persons now excluded, by extension of purposes to cover risks nowexcluded, and by raising the rates of benefit &quot;(7). ...&quot; Social insurance should aim at guaranteeing the minimum income needed for subsistence &quot;(&apos;).(i) Social Insurance and Allied Services, Cmd. 6404, 1942.(2) Ibid. para. 10.(3) Ibid. para. 21.(4) Ibid. para. 26.(5) Ibid. para. 26.(6) Ibid. para. 17.(?) Ibid. para. 12.(8) Ibid. para. 27.
The need to supplement this minimum with national assistance would eventually be wholly exceptional. While benefits other than pensions would start at a full &quot; subsistence &quot; level, the level of pensions was to be graduallyincreased over twenty years until eventually they too were adequate for&quot; subsistence &quot;.The national insurance scheme16. The principles laid down by Beveridge were widely acclaimed atthe time and were accepted as the basis for the planning which led up tothe National Insurance Act of 1946. Yet it is clear in retrospect that thenational insurance scheme, as it has developed over the last 20 years, has failed to achieve Beveridge&apos;s main objective adequate pensions and other benefits by right of contributions.17. The basic reason for this failure was undoubtedly the acceptance which was almost unanimous of Beveridge&apos;s recommendation that thescheme should be based on a system of fiat-rate contributions and benefits;but there were four other factors (a) In the first place there was the increasing proportion of the popula-tion over pension age. This had been foreseen by Beveridge, but his method of dealing with it was not adopted. He had envisaged that twenty years after his scheme had started, when the first fullpensions would be paid, the taxpayer would contribute nearly halfthe cost of the scheme. In practice, successive Governments havebeen reluctant to enlarge the Exchequer contribution to anything approaching this extent, as they considered that the cost of an insurance scheme should fall predominantly on the contributors.(b) Secondly, the Government decided that existing pensioners shouldreceive the full rate of pension straight away. Thus from 1948 thesame level of benefits was given to all pensioners, the sick, theunemployed and other categories. Furthermore, the decision wastaken to offer full pensions to those approaching pension age afteronly ten years of contributions (to be paid between 1948 and 1958).These two concessions, although inescapable in the circumstancesof the time, further weakened the financial foundations of the beveridge scheme.(c) Thirdly and this was only dimly envisaged in the 1946 Act therewas a continuing need to improve the real value of pensions andto keep them moving upwards in step with the rising living standards of those in work.(d) Fourthly, when the national assistance scheme came into operation in 1948 its levels (including allowances for rent) were in most casessubstantially above the level of national insurance pensions and benefits. From the start, therefore, hundreds of thousands of old people needed to supplement their national insurance pension withan allowance from the National Assistance Board. Supplementationhad become the rule for those with little or no other income not,as was Beveridge&apos;s ultimate objective, the exception. This situation has persisted ever since.
18. Underlying these factors was the basic weakness of the flat-rate systemitself. A flat-rate contribution falls equally on the incomes of rich andpoor. It is easily borne by the better-off, but hits the poorest hardest.The flat-rate contribution had to be set, therefore, at a level which the lowest wage-earner could afford. Experience has shown that under thissystem the level of contribution necessary to provide adequate pensions would place too great a burden on the lowest-paid contributors. As already indicated, the alternative of placing the extra burden on the exchequer was rejected by successive Governments. Nor were they prepared to adoptthe course followed in some other countries of financing adequate pensionsout of much higher employers&apos; contributions, because of the unacceptableeffect on prices and the cost of living.19. These were the problems which led to the introduction of the graduated pension scheme in 1961. The immediate purpose of this schemewas to find a new source of contribution income to buttress the ailingfinances of national insurance. But the relief it provides to the finances of the flat-rate scheme is inherently limited ; and in any case it does nottackle the long-term problem. Further, the grafting on to the flat-rate schemeof a separate structure of graduated contributions and pensions has createdextra work for employers and made the system more difficult for people tounderstand.20. The pensions provided in return for graduated contributions, combined with the flat-rate pensions, still offer no prospect of achieving the originalobjectives of the Beveridge plan. The graduated pension scheme fails in tworespects: its pensions are left unprotected against inflation and it cannotbe adjusted for economic growth. This failure was ensured by the form of contracting out which was adopted (see paragraphs 127 and 128). Employerscan hardly be required to increase the occupational pensions of those whohave been contracted out, to match improvements in the graduated pensions of the State scheme ; and it would not be right to provide higher graduated pensions only for those who have not been contracted out.21. Meanwhile, the cost of pensions continues to grow, if only because thenumber of pensioners is rising at present at a faster rate than the numberof contributors.  In 1948 there was one pensioner for every 5-6 people atTABLE 1Population (Great Britain)Men aged 65 and over; women aged 60 and over		As a percentage	As a percentage	Total	of the total	of the population	(thousands)	population	of working age (i)1948 ...............	6,448	13-2	20-41967 ...............	8,278	15-4	25-21970 ...............	8,649	15-9	26-41980 ...............	9,395	16-2	28-31990 ...............	9,579	15-4	26-92000 ...............	9,300	13-6	23-50) The population of working age comprises men and women over minimum school-leaving age and below pension age (65 for men, 60 for women).

work. At the end of 1967 there was one pensioner for every 3-6 people atwork. By 1980 it is estimated that there will be one pensioner for every3-2 people at work. As Table 1 shows, between 1967 and 1980 the pro-portion of the population over pension age is expected to increase from 15-5to 16-2 per cent. Between the same two years the ratio of people overpension age to the population of working age is expected to increase from25-3 to 28-3 per cent. Later on, the proportion of those over pension ageis expected to decline.Conclusion22. Neither the flat-rate scheme by itself, nor the present combination offlat-rate and graduated schemes, has succeeded in providing adequate pensionsby right of contribution. For those without occupational pensions or privatemeans, it is not the national insurance scheme which provides security inold age, but the supplementary benefits scheme. The latter is not, as was intended, just a &quot; safety net &quot; for the exceptional case. Instead it is a vastplatform which now helps to support some two million people over pension age.23. Like the original flat-rate scheme as planned in the Beveridge Report,the present scheme is static, and the existing structures of both benefits and contributions have failed in their purpose. The only real way forward,which tackles the problem at its roots as well as having great merits of itsown, is to create a comprehensive scheme of fully earnings-related benefits and contributions, as described in the following chapters.
J   287PART IICHAPTER 2BASIC OBJECTIVES24. The scheme now proposed will have the following basic objectives (1) Rights to benefit must be earned by the payment of contributions.(2) Benefits and contributions must be related to the contributorsearnings.(3) Benefits must normally be sufficient to live on without other means.(4) Benefits must take into account changes both in price levels and ingeneral living standards.(5) Women will contribute on the same basis as men and earn similarbenefits.(6) The scheme will be run on the &quot; pay-as-you-go &quot; principle.(7) The State scheme will work in partnership with occupational pension schemes.(8) People changing their employment will be legally entitled to have their occupational pension rights preserved.(1) Rights to benefit must be earned by the payment of contributions25. It is as true today as when Beveridge wrote his Report that benefit inreturn for contributions is what the people of Britain desire; and the state has already undertaken obligations to those who have paid contributions,often for very many years. These obligations have to be honoured. Thepresent annual cost of retirement pensions alone is over  1,500 million,which is equivalent to 5s. 3d. on the standard rate of income tax. Evenif it were remotely realistic to consider a transfer of this order from contributions to taxation, the Government would still think it wrong for pensions to be wholly tax-financed. People do not want to be given rights to pensions and benefits ; they want to earn them by their contributions. More-over, the level of wholly tax-financed pensions would undoubtedly be low.This is because people are prepared to subscribe more in a contribution fortheir own personal or family security than they would ever be willing topay in taxation devoted to a wide variety of different purposes.26. For all these reasons the Government reaffirm their commitment, tothe contributory principle. The success of the new scheme must not dependon the willingness of future Governments or future generations of taxpayersto prop it up with an increasing proportion of support from the Exchequer.The same share of the schemed income will come from the taxpayer as atpresent, and this proportion should never need to be changed. In every year the major part of the scheme&apos;s income must come from contributors andtheir employers.
(2) Benefits and contributions must be related to the contributors earnings27. The principle of relating benefits to the individual contributor^earnings, and so to his standard of living while at work, is already widely accepted in the social security schemes of other countries. Although most people are reconciled to some drop in their living standards at retirement,there is a limit to the reduction which is felt to be tolerable in any particular case. Where earnings at work have been low there may be little, if any,margin for a lowering of standards. Better-off people will have a greatermargin, but will have developed a pattern of habits and expectations which,while capable of some adjustment, can only be abandoned at great psycho-logical and social cost. People choose their housing according to what theyhave been accustomed to afford; they incur, therefore, not only expenditureon such things as rent, rates and repairs, but also other expenditures arisingfrom the community in which they live for example, on participation in local activities. Retirement is in itself a difficult time of social and psycho-logical adjustment. For all these reasons, pensions need to be related to theprevious earnings of the pensioner.28. About three-quarters of the members of occupational pension schemes are in schemes which are earnings-related. This is clearly the trend andis what more and more people are coming to expect from a good pension scheme. This makes it all the more important that the State scheme itself should be based on the principle of earnings-relation. If it were to be keptbasically flat-rate, retired people would continue to be divided into twonations those with good occupational superannuation, and those with little or nothing to add to their basic State pension except supplementary benefitbased on a test of means and needs.29. The principle of earnings-related benefits means, in turn, that contri-butions must be earnings-related as well. Payment of higher benefits to those with higher earnings cannot be justified unless they have paid, and are knownto have paid, higher contributions to the scheme. Earnings-related contri-butions also have great advantages in themselves. They enable the total income of the scheme contribution to be increased, and to be made automatic-ally buoyant in that it rises as earnings levels rise. At the same time theburden on contributors with low earnings can be reduced. This has particular importance for people who work at low rates of pay or cannot manage a fullworking week.30. Earnings-relation does not mean, however, that the State scheme willbe extended to cover the whole of a person&apos;s earnings, however large. many people would consider compulsory State pension provision justified onlyup to a certain point. As explained in paragraphs 45 to 48, the State scheme will continue to leave sufficient room for occupational pension schemes.Indeed, superannuation is only one way of providing for old age, and some people will prefer to make part of their provision by buying their own homes,or by investment. These are all reasons why there should be a maximumto the State pension and in consequence an annual earnings &quot; ceiling &quot; above which employees are not required to pay further contributions.(3) Benefits must normally be sufficient to live on without other means31. It might seem at first sight that, as in some occupational schemes,
pensions under the new scheme should be the same percentage of earnings atall levels up to the scheme&apos;s ceiling. But if this percentage were set highenough to ensure adequate pensions for low earners, the cost of applying ituniformly up to the ceiling would be very great, and the contributions needed to finance the scheme would be much too high. State provision at this level for the middle and higher earner would not be justified. The scheme must therefore strike a balance. It must provide adequate pensions at all levels,but without requiring excessively high contributions. This will be achieved by a pension formula which gives greater weight to the contributions paid on the first third of earnings covered by the scheme.(4) Benefits must take into account changes both in price levels and ingeneral living standards32. Beveridge could not foresee, or allow for, the great economic changes which have taken place even over the quarter of a century since he wrote his report. A pension scheme spans not just a quarter of a century but thewhole of adult life. For the individual there will be some forty to fifty years during which rights to pension are earned, followed by, in many cases,twenty years or more during which pension is drawn. Among risks which must be pooled is the risk that money will change its value. Amongneeds which must be met is the need for pensioners to share in thenation&apos;s rising living standards. In 1908 the 5s. pension was seen as a greatstep forward. Sixty years later a pension of eighteen times this amount isstill not enough to live on without other means.33. For these reasons the new scheme must meet two separate require-ments. First, when pensions come to be awarded they must reflect changesin general earnings levels which have taken place during the contributorsworking life. Secondly, pensions in payment must be adjusted regularly forfurther economic changes which take place during retirement. In both casesadjustment is needed not only for changes in price levels but also for changesin general living standards. (The application of this principle is discussed in paragraphs 68 and 100 to 103). The importance of adjusting for bothfactors can be seen by looking back at what has actually happened in thepast. In 1922 the average earnings of adult men were about  3 a week.In April 1968 they were over  22 a week. Only part of this increase was needed to compensate for rising prices. Earnings of about  10 would buytoday what the worker could have bought with earnings of  3 in 1922. Thuswhile prices have more than trebled over this period, the real purchasingpower of average earnings has more than doubled.34. The new scheme will accordingly provide a &quot; dynamic&quot; pension,earned by the individuaFs contributions on his earnings over working lifebut with his record in each year re-valued according to subsequent changesin earnings levels generally, up to the time he reaches pension age. Thiswill ensure that the earnings figure from which his pension is calculated and so the pension itself is in line with general living standards at thetime he reaches pension age. Further regular adjustments will then be madeto the pension during the years of retirement. Those at work are in aposition to use their bargaining strength to increase their share of the nation&apos;income. Pensioners do not have the power to protect their interests inthis way.
2(5) Women will contribute on the same basis as men and earn similar benefits35. The new scheme, like the present one, must take account of familyneeds. Some wives are away from paid work for long periods looking after their families. Furthermore, among married women who will reach pension age in the next twenty or thirty years, even those who have spent substantialperiods at work will often have achieved no corresponding insurance record,since under the present scheme they are able to choose not to pay the flat-rate contributions. Pensions and other benefits based on their husband&apos;srecords will therefore still be needed both for married women and forv/idows. But at the same time those who do go out to work must be enabled to earn benefits in their own right, and must expect to pay their fair sharetowards a scheme which pools risks and depends on contributions based on earnings.36. Under the present scheme, a married woman usually obtains a rela-tively unfavourable return for such contributions as she has paid. Not onlydoes she normally receive a reduced personal rate of flat-rate sickness orunemployment benefit, but she may gain no extra pension from flat-rate con-tributions she has paid before, or during, her marriage : if her husband hasretired or has died, she receives no pension from her own flat-rate contribu-tions unless they have been sufficient to earn more than the amount for which she qualifies in any case on his record.37. This is one reason why married women are at present offered an option whether or not to pay flat-rate national insurance contributions.A second reason for the option is to prevent a serious disincentive to their undertaking part-time work. Normally a person who works for more thaneight hours a week is liable to pay the full flat-rate contribution. This can take a very large slice out, of part-time earnings. Many married womencontemplating part-time work would wonder if it was worth while to work atall if, on top of the costs of travel to work, clothing and so on, they were obliged to pay the flat-rate contributions. Under the new scheme, this reasonfor providing a contribution option v/ill disappear. Married women in part-time employment, like other employees, will be able to contribute accordingto their earnings. Those who earn little will pay little. It will no longer be necessary to face them with the choice of either paying a contribution which represents an unduly large proportion of earnings, or else opting outof both the contribution and the benefits.38. The new scheme must recognise that it is now very common for married women to go out to work. In 1931 less than a million did so.By 1951 the number had risen to more than 2\ million. Now it exceeds 4-J-million. For the combined pensions of a married couple who have bothworked to reflect the standard of living achieved by their joint efforts, theymust be based on the earnings of both husband and wife.39. Under the new scheme women who go out to work, whether theyare single, married or widowed, will contribute on the same basis as men,and will earn pensions and other personal benefits in their own right. Whenthey are sick or unemployed, married women will receive the same personalrate of benefit as single men and women with the same earnings. They willalso be entitled to have their pensions calculated on their earnings in thesame way as single people.   But for wives who, for one reason or another,
do not have a substantial record of their own, a pension on their husband&apos;srecord will continue to be provided. For widows, the right which will begiven to older widows to inherit their husband&apos;s full rate of earnings-relatedpension will be one of the new scheme&apos;s most beneficial features.40. Besides its pension provisions, the new scheme, like the present one,will include benefits for widows of working age. These benefits will bebased on the earnings record of the husband, and will be available to widows with children and to childless widows above a certain age.41. It is often suggested that the national insurance scheme should go further and cover either all &quot;fatherless families &quot; or at least the children insuch households: this would mean an insurance benefit for divorced,separated and unmarried mothers. &quot; Fatherless familes &quot; as a whole, how-ever, not only divide into obvious groups but also show wide variationsof need and circumstances within each group. There is a great differencebetween the needs of an unmarried mother who supports her child alone, andthose of another girl who has a stable relationship with her child&apos;s father ;and there are many possible gradations between these two extremes. Simi-larly, it is often very difficult to distinguish between temporary separationsand marriages that have finally broken down. Again, the father of the childrenis normally liable to contribute towards their maintenance, while he mayor may not be liable for the maintenance of the mother. Whatever theextent of his liability, he may or may not be honouring his obligation. Theavailable information about the numbers, structure and needs of these familiesis very inadequate.42. Social security benefits are one obvious method by which fatherlessfamilies can be helped by Government action, and many of them are alreadyreceiving supplementary benefits. But they are also affected by the lawon family matters and the practices of the courts (on which the GrahamHall committee have recently made a valuable contribution) and by central and local Government policies, especially policies on housing, educa-tion and child care. The Government have therefore decided, first, to starta further study(2) of the circumstances of all families with children, payingspecial attention to one-parent families (whether fatherless or motherless) ;and, secondly, to appoint a committee to consider the general position ofone-parent families in our society and whether there are further methods by which they should be helped. The results of the study mentioned above will be available to the committee, who will meanwhile proceed with other aspects of their work. The appropriate provision for one-parent familieswill be further considered when the results of the study and the committee&apos;sreport are available.(6) The scheme will be run on the &quot; pay-as-you-go &quot; principle43. As explained in paragraph 52, the new scheme will have two separatefunds: a National Superannuation Fund and a Social Insurance Fund.Neither of them will be &quot; funded&quot; in the technical sense in which mostoccupational schemes are funded (see paragraph 47). Both funds will be run, like the present scheme, on the &quot; pay-as-you-go &quot; principle. This principle0) Report of the Committee on Statutory Maintenance Limits, Cmnd. 3587, 1968.(2) The results of a study made in 1966 were published under the title &quot; Circumstances of families&quot;, H.M.S.O., 1967.
is that current contribution income is used to meet current benefit expendi-ture the contribution rates for any period being accordingly fixed to meetthe expected expenditure in that period(&apos;). Thus contributions paid into theNational Superannuation Fund will be used to finance current pensionsexpenditure. At the same time, the State will undertake to provide thecontributors with pensions, calculated according to the new scheme&apos;s pro-visions, when they themselves come to retire. The cost of these futurepensions will in turn be met from contributions paid at the time. Sincethe new scheme&apos;s contributions will be earnings-related, the income theyproduce will automatically rise with the higher earnings levels which canbe expected to accompany economic growth. In this way the new scheme,with its earnings-related contribution income, will be able, without imposingan excessive burden on future generations of contributors, to give pensioners and other beneficiaries not only protection against the effects of price increases but also a share in the general improvement of the nation&apos;sliving standards.  (See chapter 7.)44. While &quot; pay-as-you-go&quot; financing means that the money currently being contributed for pensions is paid out to the existing pensioners, eachcontributor will at the same time be building up rights to his or her ownpersonal pension. The new pensions will be personal in the sense of beingrelated to the individual contributor^ own earnings record, instead of being at a uniform rate as under the present flat-rate scheme. They will also bepersonal in that rights earned will be retained regardless of changes inemployment, whatever the reason for them. (Universal transferability ofpension rights on change of employment is not practicable for occupational schemes see chapter 6.) Contributors will be given a regular report fromthe Department of Health and Social Security on their record underthe new scheme.(7) The State scheme will work in partnership with occupational pensionschemes45. As a result of the growth of occupational pension schemes in recentyears, described in chapter 5, people will increasingly become entitled tosuperannuation consisting of two parts one part from the State schemeand the other from an occupational scheme. For them the State scheme will serve as a foundation for the type of provision which occupational schemes are most suited to provide.46. Occupational pension schemes have an important part to play in partnership with the State scheme. This partnership cannot consist, however,of a division of the population into two sectors of pensioners, State and occupational. It would be extremely difficult to apply any such division to people who move into and out of occupational schemes at differentstages of their working lives. The best foundation for the success of occupational schemes is the existence of a substantial basic compulsory state scheme ; and strong arguments can be advanced that, so far from haridi-capping occupational schemes, -the new State scheme will assist their develop-ment. (See paragraphs 106 to 109.)(&apos;) In the early years of the new scheme, the income of the National Superannuation fund will be somewhat more than will be needed to meet its current expenditure-see paras. 167to 170.17
.    29347. The strength of occupational pensions lies in the principle of savingsupon which most of them are built. The contributions paid to private schemesaccumulate and earn an element of interest which grows throughout theworking life of the member. This interest contributes an important part ofthe pension when it comes to be paid out. A &quot; pay-as-you-go&quot; schemeoperated by the State whether a nation-wide scheme like national insuranceor a sectional scheme such as is provided for civil servants is not obligedto accumulate a fund except in so far as may be necessary to provide areserve against any unexpected drop in income or rise in expenditure. Itsincome from interest accordingly plays a comparatively small part in meeting its benefit expenditure.48. While a State scheme must have relatively standardised provisions, anoccupational scheme can be adapted to meet the special needs of particularoccupations and industries. Inevitably the major changes in the State schemewhich the Government are proposing will involve readjustment in occupa-tional provision. The extent of the readjustment required can be limited by an arrangement for partial contracting out of the State scheme, as explained in chapter 5. On the other hand, during the past few years thegrowth of occupational provision may have been held back in some caseswhile the Governments proposals were awaited. The Government hope thatthe publication of this White Paper will enable further development in suchcases to go ahead.(8) People changing their employment will be legally entitled to have their occupational pension rights preserved49. At present there are no universal or comprehensive arrangements for safeguarding occupational pension rights on changes of employment. ACommittee of the Minister of Labour&apos;s National Joint Advisory Council,which was appointed to report on the economic and social implications ofexisting arrangements for preservation of pension rights on change of em-ployment, concluded that there were strong social arguments for more extensive arrangements for safeguarding occupational pension rights^).50. The Government endorse this conclusion and accordingly intend toimpose on all occupational schemes the obligation of offering to their members the right, if desired, to have their pension rights preserved onchange of employment. Those employees who prefer to have their contribu-tions returned to them will however still be able to do so. (See chapter 6.)(!) &quot; Preservation of Pension Rights &quot;-Report of a Committee of the National joint advisory Council, H.M.S.O., 1966.
294CHAPTER 3THE GOVERNMENTS MAIN. PROPOSALS51. This chapter describes the Governments main proposals. Fullerexplanations of certain points are given in Appendix 1. For convenience allcash figures are expressed in pounds, shilling and pence, rather than in thedecimal currency which will come into use before the new scheme begins.The National Superannuation Fund and the Social Insurance Fund52. At present there is one fund for all national insurance contributions and benefits. Under the new scheme there will be two separate funds: aNational Superannuation Fund for pensions, widowhood benefits and deathgrant; and a Social Insurance Fund for the remaining benefits. Each fund will receive its appropriate share of the total income from contributions,and this share will be used to meet the expenditure on the benefits charged to it (including benefits still in payment from the present scheme). Separatefunds will reflect the different natures of the benefits concerned, and will help people to understand the purposes for which they are contributing.Contributions paid into one fund will not be diverted for use by the other.Contributors can therefore know what proportion of their contributions is for national superannuation and what proportion for other purposes, and can besure that money paid for one purpose will not be used for another.53. The initial rates of contribution to the National Superannuation fund will be fixed with the aim of providing an income sufficient to meet the growing pension expenditure for some years after the new scheme begins.After that, the contribution rates will need to be somewhat increased. Inthe early years the National Superannuation Fund will accumulate a surplus,which will be invested. (See paragraphs 167 to 170 and the Memorandumby the Government Actuary at Appendix 2.)Contributions for Employed PersonsEmployees&apos; contributions54. The present contributions for employed persons are in three parts.First, there is the flat-rate contribution, which is collected through thestamped card system. Secondly, there is the contribution for graduated pension, charged at A\ per cent on earnings between  9 and  18 a week.Thirdly, there is the contribution for earnings-related short-term sickness,unemployment and widowhood benefits, charged at \ per cent on earnings between  9 and  30 a week. The last two contributions are collectedtogether through the PA YE income tax system.55. Under the new scheme these three contributions will all be abolished,and with them the present system of stamped cards. Instead, all employees19
w.*    2 9coming within the PA YE systemC) will pay a single type of contribution,collected through that systemf). This contribution will be a straight per-centage of all their earnings in each yearf), up to a maximum or &quot; ceiling &quot;of about 1J- times national average earnings^). At April 1968(5) earningslevels this ceiling would be  1,700 a year (equivalent to about  33 a week);the cash amount will increase over the years as national average earningsrise. In 1968, about 7 per cent of the 22 million employees covered byPA YE were earning  1,700 a year or more, and so would have paid thenew contributions on their yearly earnings up to that amount but notbeyond. The remaining 93 per cent would have paid the new contributionson the whole of their earnings.56. The percentage contributions will be paid by employed men andwomen alike. The percentage rate will be the same for both ; and the newcontributions (unlike the present flat-rate contributions) will be compulsoryfor married women and widows who go out to work, on the same basis as for other employees. At the start of the scheme the total contribution ratepayable by employees will be 6f per cent. Of this total, 4f per cent will befor national superannuation. The remaining 2 per cent will be for social insurance benefits, industrial injuries benefits and a contribution to theNational Health Service.57. To illustrate how the change to the new contributions will affectemployees, Table 2 shows the position as it would have been if the new scheme had started in April 1968(5). The table gives, at various earningslevels, the total present-scheme contributions which were paid by employeesat that time, their total new-scheme contributions, and the difference betweenthe two. The corresponding figures when the new scheme starts will ofcourse depend on the levels of earnings and of present-scheme contributionsat that time.(!) Generally speaking, people who are treated as employed persons for national insurancepurposes also come within the PAYE system, and vice versa. The possibility of bringing the two systems still closer into line is being examined. For employees with low earnings,see para. 99.(2) See Appendix 1, paras. 5 to 7.(3) See Appendix 1, paras. 3 and 4.(4) Here and elsewhere, &quot; national average earnings &quot; is used, for convenience, to mean the average earnings of adult male manual workers in manufacturing industries and certainnon-manufacturing industries and services, as obtained from the Department of employment and Productivity&apos;s half-yearly enquiries into earnings. The latest available figure (for April1968) is about  22 5s. a week.(5) Because of the link with the PAYE system, the new contributions must begin on a6th April, at the beginning of a &quot; tax year &quot;.

For married women and widows who have opted not to do so(and who therefore pay only the industrial injuries contribution of 7d. a week) the figures in column (2) would all be 12s. 7d. less; and 12s. 7d. would therefore need to be added to thefigures in column (4).Employers&apos; contributions58. Employers&apos; contributions under the new scheme will be calculated asa percentage o ftheir total PAYE payroll, with no earnings ceiling(1). Atthe start of the scheme, the total contribution rate for employers will be 6-Jper cent. Of this total, 4-J per cent will be for national superannuation ;this will yield approximately the same total income as the employees&apos; rateof 4f per cent, which will apply only up to the earnings ceiling. Employersand employees as a whole will therefore contribute approximately the sameto the National Superannuation Fund. Of the remaining 2\ per cent ofthe employers&apos; contribution rate, 2 per cent will be for social insurance benefits, industrial injuries benefits and a contribution to the national health Service ; and \ per cent has been allowed for the Redundancy Fund(replacing employers&apos; present flat-rate contributions to that fund). the contribution to the National Health Service will be at the same percentagerate for employers as for employees (in the former case without an eam-ings ceiling); this is in contrast to the present flat-rate National health service contributions, which are much lower for employers than employees.The Exchequer contribution59. The total Exchequer contribution to the present national insurancescheme is now about  340 million a year; this amounts to about 18 percent of the combined national insurance contributions of insured persons(!) See Appendix I, paras. 8 to 10.21
and employers. Under the new scheme the Exchequer will contributeapproximately the same proportion; and the amount this produces will in-crease automatically as earnings levels rise.National Superannuation Benefits for Employed PersonsRetirement pensionsPension ages and the retirement condition60. The minimum ages for pension will remain at 65 for men and 60 forwomenO). The pensions will still be retirement pensions: that is, until age70 (men) or 65 (women) they will be paid only to people who have retiredfrom regular employment. Up to these ages there will therefore still need to be an earnings rule, whereby a retirement pension is reduced if the pen-si oner earns more than a certain amount(2). Those who retire after age 65(men) or 60 (women) will earn extra pension, the amount of which will take into account both the contributions they have paid after reaching pension age and the amount of pension they have forgone through their later retire-ment.Transition to the new-scheme rates61. Rights to the full new pensions will be built up gradually over thefirst twenty years of the scheme. Pensions for people reaching pension ageduring this twenty-year &quot; maturity period&quot; will be at intermediate rates,calculated by combining rights earned by contributions under the presentflat-rate scheme with rights earned under the new scheme. Those whoreach pension age after the first year of the new scheme will get nineteen-twentieths of the present-scheme rate, plus one-twentieth of the the new scheme rate based on their earnings since the new scheme began. Thosereaching pension age after the second year will get eighteen-twentieths andtwo-twentieths respectively. And so on, until the first fully mature new-scheme pensions are paid to those reaching pension age twenty years afterthe scheme begins. The pensions awarded during the maturity period will remain at intermediate rates ; but the rates in payment will be reviewedevery two years as described in paragraphs 100 to 103. The transitional arrangements are explained in more detail in Appendix 1, paragraphs 20to 23.End of the present graduated scheme62. When the new earnings-related scheme begins, the present graduated scheme will come to an end ; and no further rights will be earned under it.The graduated pension rights already earned up to that date will be pre-served, and paid on top of the new-scheme pensions calculated as in para-graph 61. For the reason explained in paragraph 20, the amounts earnedunder the present graduated scheme will not be covered by the two-yearlyreviews of benefit rates.How new-scheme pensions will be calculated63. The principles on which the new pensions will be calculated were set out in chapter 2. The following paragraphs show how these principleswill be put into practice.(!) This important decision is explained in Appendix 1, paras. 11 to 15.(2) See Appendix 1, paras. 16 to 19.
29(i) The main pension formula64. The pensions earned under the new scheme will, like the contributions,be wholly earnings-related. The fully mature new-scheme pension for asingle person will be made up of 60 per cent of his or her earnings up to half national average earnings, and 25 per cent of the remainder up to thescheme&apos;s ceiling. This is the new scheme&apos;s main &quot; pension formula &quot;. AtApril 1968 earnings levels, the changeover point between the two parts ofthe formula would have been at earnings of about  11 a week, and the ceiling at earnings of about  33 a week. Both the changeover point andthe ceiling will increase as national average earnings rise.65. Rights built up by contributions under the present flat-rate scheme will be taken into account in calculating new-scheme pensions, as explained in paragraph 61. Contributors with very low earnings under the new scheme, or none at all, will be able, if they wish, to keep up their rightto pension at the rate provided for present-scheme pensioners (see para-graph 99).(ii) Earnings over working life66. Under the present scheme, both the flat-rate and the graduated pension entitlement depend on the contributions paid during the whole of working life. On the other hand, many occupational schemes calculate pensions on earnings during the last few years of employment. This is appropriate forschemes which cover only salaried workers who can expect to reach theirpeak earnings just before they retire. But it would not be suitable for manymanual workers. In many occupations the earning ability of manual workers drops in their forties and fifties because they can no longer do themore strenuous work, or can no longer work at the same pace. taking account of all earnings throughout working life is fairer both to people whohave been relatively high earners at different periods of their lives and tothose who have had to take work of a lower grade at any time for health or other reasons. Retirement pensions will therefore continue under thenew scheme to be based on the &quot; whole life &quot; principle. The working lifefor this purpose will be taken as the period from the beginning of the taxyear containing the 19th birthday, up to age 65 (men) or 60 (women).67. The present flat-rate scheme requires a person to have a minimumlife average of 13 contributions a year in order to qualify for any pension(apart from a pension received by a wife or widow on her husband&apos;s record).There will be a corresponding minimum qualifying condition under the new scheme.(iii) Life average earnings68. When a contributor^ life average under the new scheme comes to be calculated, his earnings in each year will be re-valued in line with the changes which have since taken place in the level of national average earnings.In this way his earnings will be converted into their up-to-date equivalent atthe time he reaches pension age. As a result, for example, a man who had had exactly national average earnings every year of his working life wouldhave his pension calculated on national average earnings as they were atthe time he reached pension age, not on the money average of his actual
2earnings over life (which might come to only a fraction of this, as thefigures in paragraph 33 show). All the necessary recording and calculationwill be done by computer.(iv) Credited earnings for periods of sickness or unemployment69. If pension were calculated only on actual earnings, adjusted as des-cribed above, people with considerable sickness or imemployment might not receive adequate pensions. During periods when sickness or unemploymentbenefit is paid, and in some other circumstances, contributors&apos; records will therefore be credited, for the purpose of calculating their future benefitentitlement, with earnings of, normally, half the national average (that is,about  11 a week at April 1968 levels). This will correspond to the full60 per cent part of the pension formula, as described in paragraph 64.Further details of the arrangements for crediting earnings are given inAppendix 1, paragraphs 24 to 26.(v) Examples of new-scheme pensions for a single person70. Under a dynamic earnings-related scheme of this kind, it is not possibleto foretell what a person&apos;s eventual pension will amount to in cash terms.This will depend both on his own earnings record over working life andon changes in national average earnings during that time. Any exampleexpressed in cash terms can therefore do no more than give a general ideaof how the pension calculation will work in practice.71. It is not possible to forecast what the level of national average earningswill be when the new scheme starts, or over the following years. The resultsproduced by the pension formula are therefore illustrated in Table 3 by reference to the actual earnings levels in the recent past. The table givessome examples of fully mature new-scheme pensions (see paragraph 61)worked out at the earnings levels which existed in April 19680. Theseexamples therefore illustrate the pensions which contributors reaching pension age at that time would have received if the new scheme had started twenty years previously, in April 1948. Figures are given for contributors with lifeaverage earnings of five different proportions of the national average^), asshown in column (1). The cash amounts of these earnings at April 1968levels are in column (2). The corresponding weekly pension amounts whichthe new scheme&apos;s 60 per cent/25 per cent pension formular would producefor a single person are in column (3). The figures in this column representthe pension at the time of award, and show the effect of the greater weightgiven to earnings up to the changeover point of the formula (see para-graph 31). FOr married couplies the pensions would be higher by at least 2 16s. (the wife&apos;s flat-rate pension on her husband&apos;s record), with theamount above this depending on the wife&apos;s own record, as explained inparagraph 72. There will continue to be flat-rate increases for dependent children. Column (4) of the table shows for comparison the total present-scheme pension, flat-rate plus graduated, for a single man in April 1968.(The present graduated pension scheme started in April 1961 ; the amounts of graduated pension shown therefore represent the totals earned over that scheme&apos;s first seven years.)C1) See footnote on page 20.

A married woman&apos;s retirement pension will be calculated in whicheverof the following ways is more favourable for her (1) A pension based on her own life average earnings and calculatedfrom the main 60 per cent/25 per cent pension formula in exactly the same way as for men and single women (see paragraphs 64 to71).or (2) A flat-rate pension on her husband&apos;s record^), as under the existing scheme (the present rate being  2 16s. a week), plus an earnings-related addition of 25 per cent of her own life average earnings.73. At the start of the new scheme, calculation (2) will be better for thegreat majority of pensioner wives ; but the build-up of married women&apos;earnings records under the new scheme will gradually increase the numbers for whom calculation (1) is more favourable. Under either calculation allthe wife&apos;s contributions paid after the new scheme begins, whether before or during marriage, will bring her extra pension. For dependent wives underage 60 a flat-rate addition to the husband&apos;s retirement pension will be paid,as under the existing scheme (the present rate being  2 16s. a week).74. The new earnings-related pensions for married women, like those for single people, will build up gradually, over the first twenty years of thescheme, to the fully mature new-scheme rates. Under calculation (1) inparagraph 72, the method will be as described in paragraph 61. Undercalculation (2), the earnings-related addition for a married woman reachingpension age after the first year of the scheme will be one-twentieth of the
was- V,,full 25 per cent rate (calculated on her average earnings since the new scheme began) ; and the proportion will rise, by annual steps of one-twentieth,until the fully mature new-scheme rate is paid to those reaching pension agetwenty years after the scheme begins.Women widowed after reaching age 6075. A wife whose husband dies when she is aged 60 or over will receivewhichever of the following pensions is more favourable for her (.1) The same personal rate of retirement pension as her husband was receiving, or had earned, when he died. If he died before reachingage 65, her pension will be based on his life record of average earnings, with the years he had still to live before reaching age 65filled in by crediting earnings at, normally, one half the national average(:).or (2) A pension based entirely on her own life average earnings andcalculated from the main 60 per cent/25 per cent formula in theusual way.Younger widows(i) Widow&apos;s allowance76. There will continue to be an earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance forthe first six months of widowhood. As now, this will be based on the husband&apos;s earnings in the previous tax year. The method of calculating the allowance will be revised to take into account the abolition of flat-rate contri-butions and benefits.(ii) Widowed mother&apos;s allowance77. A widow who has a child under 19 in her family will receive anearnings-related widowed motheds allowance. This will be calculated inthe same way as the pension in paragraph 75(1), with the addition of a flat-rate allowance for each dependent child. As at present, the amount ofthis allowance will be higher than child allowances generally.(iii) Widow&apos;s pension78. An earnings-related widow&apos;s pension will be paid to women who arewidowed after reaching age 50, and also to widows who are aged 50 or overwhen their entitlement to widowed mother&apos;s allowance ceases. This pension will be calculated in the way described in paragraph 75(1). Any contributions of the widow after her husband&apos;s death will add to the eventual retirement pension which she will receive on his record. Alternatively, if better, herretirement pension will be based entirely on her own life average.79. At present a woman who is widowed under age 50, and has nochild under 19 in her family, normally receives no pension at all until shereaches age 60. The same is true of a widowed mother whose youngestchild reaches 19 before she is 50. A difference of a few days in the dateof the husband&apos;s death or in a child&apos;s nineteenth birthday can decide whether for the next ten years a widow receives a pension at the full rate or nothingat all.
-    30280. Under the new scheme, a woman who is between age 40 and 49 when she is widowed, or when her entitlement to widowed mother&apos;s allowanceceases, will receive, while she is under age 60, an earnings-related widow&apos;pension. This will be calculated in the same way as in paragraph 78 butscaled down according to her age at that time, with a minimum pensioncorresponding to about  1 10s. a week at present-day levels. Her eventualretirement pension will take into account both her husband&apos;s earnings recordand any earnings of her own after his death. Alternatively, if better, herretirement pension will be based entirely on her own life average.81. Existing widows will be able to qualify for a scaled-down flat-ratepension under the new arrangements, if they would have satisfied the newqualifying conditions at the time when they were widowed or when theirentitlement to widowed mother&apos;s allowance ceased.Transitional arrangements for widowhood benefits82. The transitional arrangements for the widowhood benefits described in paragraph 77 to 80 will be similar to those for retirement pensions (seeparagraph 61), with a gradual build-up, over the first twenty years of thescheme, to the fully mature new-scheme rates.Pension provision for divorced women83. Under the present flat-rate scheme, a woman who becomes divorcedunder age 60 can have her retirement pension calculated by taking over herex-husband&apos;s contribution record for the period of their marriage, if this isto her advantage. Under the new scheme she will be able to take over hisrecord for the period before as well as during the marriage.84. A woman who becomes divorced after reaching age 60 can at presentreceive, on her ex-husband&apos;s insurance, the full amount of the flat-ratepension for a single person. A corresponding right will be given under thenew scheme.Pension provision for separated wives85. The present scheme gives a separated wife cover for retirement pen-sion and widowhood benefits on her husband&apos;s insurance, whether or not sheherself has paid contributions. Her entitlement to these benefits on her husband&apos;s record will continue under the new scheme. Her rights will bemade more valuable by the improvements in married women&apos;s pensions andwidowhood benefits described in paragraphs 72 to 80.Death grant86. Death grant, which is paid to help with funeral expenses, will con-tinue to be at a flat rate. The grant will be extended, on the insurance of close relatives, to cover the deaths of handicapped people who were livingwith them and who had never been able to work and contribute.Social Insurance BenefitsShort-term sickness benefit87. Under the present scheme, the basic flat-rate sickness benefit can be supplemented, for up to six months, by an earnings-related addition basedon the employee^ earnings in the previous tax year.  In the new scheme
1WS&quot; v.there will be a single earnings-related short-term sickness benefit, also payable for up to six months. There will continue to be higher rates for married men than for single people, and additions for children. Married womencontributors who are themselves sick will receive the same personal rate ofbenefit as other contributors (instead of a lower rate as at present). during periods of benefit, earnings will be credited in the sick person&apos;s record, as described in paragraph 69. Further details of the new arrangements for short-term sickness benefit, including the benefit formula to be applied to the employee^ earnings, will be announced separately.Long-term sickness benefit88. After short-term sickness benefit ends, there will be a new earnings-related long-term sickness benefit. This will not be restricted to cases ofpermanent or prolonged illness, but will be the rate of sickness benefit paidafter entitlement to the initial short-term rate has ended. It will thereforeoften be paid for comparatively short periods. For those who are not ableto return to work it will be in effect an invalidity pension, which will continue until pension age and will then be replaced by retirement pension.89. The rate of long-term sickness benefit will be calculated from thecontributor^ life average earnings in the same way as retirement pension(see paragraphs 64 to 69). The years remaining up to age 65 (men) or 60(women) will be filled in by crediting earnings at, normally, one half thenational average(&apos;). Flat-rate increases will be paid for a dependent wife and children, as under the existing scheme. The transitional arrangements will be similar to those for retirement pensions (see paragraph 61), with a gradual build-up, over the first twenty years of the scheme, to the fullymature new-scheme rates.Attendance allowance for the very severely disabled90. Among those who have been ill or disabled for some time, there area number with a handicap so severe that it makes them wholly or largely dependent on help from other people in coping with the ordinary functionsof daily living. Where they are being cared for at home, the strain on their families can be considerable. Many of them prefer to remain in their ownsurroundings rather than go into a hospital or home ; and many families areprepared to take on the extra burden of caring for a severely disabled relative.91. A new attendance allowance will therefore be introduced for very severely disabled people. Wives who have not themselves been paying con-tributions will be able to receive the allowance on their husbands&apos; insurance.The allowance will be at a flat rate, and will be available to people whoare already disabled when it is introduced. A corresponding allowance willbe provided under the supplementary benefits scheme ; this will be of specialhelp to those, such as the congenitally disabled, who have no contributionrecord and few resources of their own. The Government Social Surveyis at present conducting a nation-wide survey of the chronic sick and disabled, sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Security. Thisis designed, among other things, to establish the facts which are neededbefore decisions are taken on the precise details of the new allowance.
*    *     ,Unemployment benefit92. An earnings-related benefit, corresponding to the new short-term sick-ness benefit (see paragraph 87), will be paid for up to six months of unem-ployment. It will be followed, as under the present scheme, by a flat-ratebenefit for up to a further six months.Other benefits93. Consequential changes in other insurance benefits, including maternitybenefits and guardian&apos;s allowance, and in industrial injuries benefits, willbe announced separately.Occupational Pension SchemesPartial contracting out of the new scheme94. Employees in occupational pension schemes can be contracted out ofthe present State graduated pension scheme, but not out of the basic flat-rate scheme. The Government are confident that fair and workable arrange-ments can be made to allow employees in occupational schemes to becontracted out of part of the new retirement pension provisions. under such arrangements the employee^ and employees contributions to the new scheme would be reduced, and part of the employee^ retirement pension would be provided instead by the employer through the occupational scheme.This subject is fully discussed in chapter 5.Preservation of occupational pension rights95. At present many employees in occupational pension schemes forfeitpart or all of their pension rights when they leave a job. In future thosewho have satisfied certain minimum qualifying conditions will be given theright to have the amount of occupational pension which they earn preservedfor them until they reach the age for drawing it. Those who prefer to have their contributions returned to them, when they change their employer, will still be able to do so. Further details are given in chapter 6.Consultation on occupational pension matters96. The Government will discuss the matters referred to in paragraphs 94and 95 with representatives of occupational pension schemes and othersspecially interested in these subjects. In its role as employer, the Govern-ment will likewise be consulting the organisations representing employees in the public services.The Self-Employed97. Self-employed people are not included in the present graduated pension scheme. In principle their new-scheme contributions and benefits, like those for employees, should be related to their earnings. But thorough study of theproblems has shown that this is not practicable, at least for the time being(see Appendix 1, paragraphs 29 to 32). The self-employed will thereforebe brought into the new scheme by contributing to it at a flat rate. Some-one with a mixture of employment and self-employment during his working life (as most self-employed people will probably have) will still have asingle integrated record.
30598. Self-employed men and women including married women and windows, who at present can choose whether or not to pay contributions will contribute alike. Their contributions will count for benefits (except, as now, unemployment benefit and industrial injuries benefits) at the levelearned by employees with half national average earnings. This willcorrespond to the full 60 per cent part of the pension formula as described in paragraph 64. As with employed persons, there will be additional provi-sion for wives and children. On this basis the total new-scheme contribu-tions for a self-employed person would have come to about  1 7s. a week at April 1968 levels, of which about  1 Is. a week would be forthe National Superannuation Fund. If the scheme had been introduced atthat time, this would have involved increases of about 6s. a week for menand just under 10s. a week for women (or the full  1 7s. a week for thoseself-employed married women and widows not paying the present-schemecontributions). Contributions of this size would be a very heavy burden on those with low earnings. For this reason, the new self-employed contribu-tions will be compulsory only for those earning more than half national average earnings (that is, about  11 a week at April 1968 levels). Thoseearning less than this will however be able to pay self-employed contribu-tions if they want to ; alternatively, they will be able to contribute voluntarilyfor pensions and certain other benefits (see Appendix 1, paragraphs 36-37).Ways in which the self-employed will be able to pay their contributions under the new scheme are being examined.Low Earners and Non-Earners99. Employees whose earnings are too low to bring them within thePAYE system (at present this means those earning less than  5 5s. aweek) will not be compelled to pay contributions under the new scheme.Nor will people who do not earn at all. There will however be arrange-ments for voluntary contributions to be paid to bring a person&apos;s record forany year up to the level which would produce a pension at the standard rate then in force for present-scheme pensioners (at present  4 10s. a week for a single person,  7 6s. for a married couple). Further details are givenin Appendix 1, paragraphs 33 to 37.Reviews of Pensions and Other Benefits in Payment100. In the past there has been no proper system for increasing benefitsalready in payment. The intervals between increases have varied con-siderably, and the changes have rarely come into effect at what is clearly the best time of year, before the beginning of winter.101. Under the new scheme the Government will be bound by statute to review every two years the main rates of national insurance and industrial injuries benefits in payment. The reviews will cover present-scheme^) aswell as new-scheme pensions and other benefits. The increases, which will always come into operation in the autumn, will compensate for any rise in price levels since the previous increase. But this inflation-proofing is onlya minimum. Pensioners and other beneficiaries will also continue to share in the natiohs rising living standards.  The actual amount of improvement(!) Other than the present graduated pensions, for the reasons explained in para. 20.
on each occasion, beyond the inflation-proofing, must be left for decision by the Government of the day, which will need to take into account such factors as movements in earnings levels, changes in the standard of living of the community as a whole, and the general economic situation.102. The Government propose that the benefit increases should be broughtabout by regulations, without the present need for a new Act of parliament on each occasion.103. As in the past, war pensions and allowances will be increased at thesame time as other benefits ; but no new statutory provision is needed forthis since they are not governed by Act of Parliament. supplementary benefits will be dealt with along with the main benefits in each biennialreview ; and they can always be increased by regulations.Timing of the Scheme&apos;s Introduction104. The Government hope that the new scheme will be thoroughlydiscussed, in Parliament and elsewhere, before its details are finally settled;and they wdl consult organisations with special interests in this field. after taking account of these consultations, they intend to introduce the necessary legislation in the 1969-70 session of Parliament. Because of the link withthe PAYE system, the scheme must start at the beginning of an income taxyear, in April. The target date is April 1972.
307CHAPTER 4THE ALTERNATIVES105. Before putting forward the proposals in the previous chapter, theGovernment have considered two other possibilities which are sometimesadvanced as alternatives to extending the national insurance scheme: greater&quot; selectivity&quot;, and reliance on occupational pension schemes.Greater seletcivityl106. It is often suggested that, if national insurance pensions were to bekept at their present level, or were to be increased only to compensate forrising prices, greater help could then be given to the poorest pensioners.Giving larger pensions to those who do not &quot; need &quot; them is said to bewasteful. It is claimed that by being more selective the Government could reduce the burden of public expenditure. This amounts to suggesting thatthe present gap between contributory pensions and supplementary benefit should be widened, rather than narrowed.107. In the Governments view there are compelling reasons why the mainprovision for social security should be through contributory benefits, ratherthan as may be suitable in some other fields, such as rate rebates throughreliance on means-testing. The chief reasons are (1) A further widening of the gap between the levels of pensions and supplementary benefits could produce an enormous increase in thenumber of pensioners needing supplementation. As indicated inparagraph 9, in 1965 a widening of the gap by no more than  2 aweek would have meant that something like three-quarters that is,nearly five million of all pensioners would have been within thescope of means-tested supplementation. This would be a disastrousstep in the wrong direotion. There is a widespread and deep-seatedfeeling that, after a lifetime of work, people should receive a pension which is not reduced because they have other income or savings.The figures just quoted show that by far the greater part of theexpenditure on pension increases goes to people with low incomes.(2) No means-tested scheme will be used by all those who are entitledto claim. The supplementary benefits scheme has shown that, withenlightened design and humane administration, much can be done to overcome ignorance or reluctance; but there will always bepeople in need who do not come forward. Either they are not reached by publicity about the scheme or, having treasured their independence throughout their working lives, they are reluctant to admit to outsiders, or sometimes even to themselves, that they find it difficult to make ends meet. This difficulty cannot be resolved by any magic of the computer, as some people have suggested. a computer can process efficiently and rapidly such facts as are fedinto it.  But it cannot make calculations on facts which have not
been collected. Inevitably those claiming supplementary benefitmust answer what are commonly regarded as highly personalquestions; and this is precisely what a minority are reluctant to do.(3) Increased reliance on supplementary benefit in providing for old age would also have damaging effects on private savings and onoccupational pension schemes. This point has been well expressedin a recent report by the State Pensions Committee of the national association of Pension Funds:&quot;Employers are deterred from setting up schemes for lower-paid workers, if they see that much of the benefit to their employees will be counterbalanced by a reduction in the pensionsprovided from a State system to which they have contributedon the same basis as other less generous employers. Employeesare reluctant to contribute to occupational schemes if they fear that a State means test will deprive them of much of the resultingbenefit. Many employers are already finding that the means testfor supplementary benefits under the present social security system is making it difficult for them to persuade their lower paidemployees to join their pension schemes.&apos;^1)108. The undesirable effects on the development of occupational schemes,and on savings generally, would occur whatever method of applying a means test was used. This alone rules out in this field any proposal based onthe idea of a &quot; negative income tax&quot;, which is sometimes put forward as a method of means-testing which is automatic and all-embracing, andtherefore not open to social objections. But in fact a negative incometax would by no means be easy to operate. It is sometimes assumed thatthe Government already possess the relevant facts about peopte&apos;s require-ments and current resources, and that all they need to do is bring together in a computer the different pieces of information held by different Depart-ments. But this is far from true. For example, the Government do nothave details of rents. Many elderly people with low incomes do not makea return to the Inland Revenue and can hardly be compelled to do so. the tax returns made by others cover income in the previous year whereasup-to-date information would be essential if people&apos;s current needs were tobe properly met.109. All this reinforces the Governments determination to strengthenand develop the contributory principle in social security. People cannotbe expected to contribute willingly for a pension unless it is worth having.The contributory principle would break down if many people had reasonto believe that the Government would in the end pay the same amountwhether they contributed or not.Occupational pension schemes an alternative for the longer term?110. The second suggestion is that occupational pension schemes are becoming so widespread that eventually they could meet, or very nearlymeet, all need for pensions above a low minimum provided by the state scheme. Some would go even further, seeking to combine this with the&quot; selectivist&quot; approach.   They argue that the adoption of greater selectivity(!) &quot; The Future Relationship of State and Occupational Pensions &quot;, published by theNational Association of Pension Funds, September 1968, p. 22.
309in State pensions could pave the way for the ultimate withdrawal of Govern-ment from the field of provision for old age, except for a residual means-tested scheme. The State, it is suggested, could thus avoid incurring any pension obligations for those now starting work, and the savings could besplit between reductions in public expenditure and improvements in other services which only the State can provide.111. Would it ever be possible for all or virtually all old people to receive a pension from an occupational scheme or, in the case of the self-employed,from an approved pension plan? And would such pensions be enough,when added to a basic State pension insufficient by itself, to ensure adequatetotal provision for their old age?112. During recent years the number of employees in occupational pension schemes has considerably increased: it is now over 12 million. In total the schemes have been making a major contribution to national saving.In 1967 their total income from contributions was about  1,265 million andtheir expenditure about  935 million. The number of people receivingoccupational benefits in old age was about two million, although, as Table 4shows, the amounts provided were often small.TABLE 4Amounts of pension payable tooccupational pensioners, 1967 (estimated)Proportion of weekly amount of pension pensionersper centUnder  1............      20 1 to  2    ............      20 2 to  3    ............       10 3 to  4   ............       10 4 and over       ...      ......      40Total............     100113. The present coverage of occupational schemes varies considerablyamong different groups of the population. While about 75 per cent of male non-manual employees are in a scheme, the coverage among malemanual workers is probably not much more than 50 per cent. Some 75 percent of men employed in the public sector are in occupational schemes,compared with 60 per cent of men in the private sector. The proportion ofemployed women who are in schemes is 25 per cent.114. There are inherent limits to the ultimate expansion of occupational pensions. First, many of the people who have no occupational scheme workfor small firms: there are about a million employers of all kinds in Britain,but less than 70,000 active pension schemes. Small employers are lessequipped to have a scheme than large employers. In particular, there are many thousands of small firms-in engineering, in the distributive, building and other trades where the employer could reasonably claim that hisoperation is on too small a scale, and his labour turnover too high, tojustify an occupational pension scheme.
115. Secondly, the benefits of occupational schemes tend, like wages and salaries, not to be adjusted to family needs. Perhaps two-thirds of the occupational pensions at present being paid to men. will die with them ;and about a third of men at work today are in schemes giving no permanentwidowhood pension cover once they have retired. Usually a man can make provision for his wife only by cutting into his own pension. Few wivesspend sufficiently long at work to earn occupational pensions of their own.116. It is estimated on present trends that even by the turn of the centuryabout a third of retirement pensioner households will still have no occupa-tional pension at all. It would be impracticable to attempt to close this gap in coverage by making occupational schemes compulsory: the control of auniversal network of private schemes, even if one could be set up, would create formidable administrative and financial problems both for theGovernment and for the schemes themselves.117. Finally, growth in the coverage of occupational schemes, and improve-ments in the levels of pensions which they award, will still leave theproblem of maintaining the value of occupational pensions once they are in payment. Not all schemes have found it possible to increase pensions afterretirement; and such increases as are given are often haphazard and maybe inadequate. At most they do no more than compensate for rising prices.Thus, while many schemes provide pensions which are adequate at the timeof retirement, there is seldom any guarantee that their value will not beeroded as time goes on. Some old people are therefore faced with theprospect of steadily diminishing resources at the same time as their capacity to improve their circumstances is also getting less.118. It is no criticism of occupational schemes to draw attention to needswhich, by their nature, they cannot be expected to meet. Their purposes are different from those of a social security scheme. They can add to thepensions of many ; but they cannot be a substitute for an adequate state scheme. If adequate benefits are to be provided for the irregularlyemployed, the chronic sick and widows, and if additions to pensions areto be made for family responsibilities such as the care of wives who havehad long periods away from employment, this is clearly a task for the state scheme and not for occupational schemes. Moreover, if there is to be apension which is guaranteed to maintain its real value, this also is a task which the State scheme can fulfil but which raises great difficulties foroccupational schemes. Occupational schemes cannot be expected to coverall needs. The Governments aim is to allow them to fulfil their essentiallycomplementary role, as explained in the following two chapters.
PART chapter 5THE NEW STATE SCHEME AND OCCUPATIONAL schemes the role of occupational pension schemes119. The new State scheme described in chapter 3 will bring considerableextra benefit cover to contributors who are members of occupational pension schemes, as well as to those who are not. Reference has already beenmade to the impressive growth in occupational schemes in recent years. Itis estimated that at the end of 1967 there were about 65,000 active pension schemes, excluding arrangements for individuals, compared with about37,500 in 1956. The membership of such schemes increased from about million in 1956 to over 11 million in 1963 and to over 12 million in1967. Thus half of all employed persons, including about two-thirds of allemployed men, are now members of occupational pension schemes (and thistakes no account of those employees who will become members of theiremployer^ scheme as soon as they have satisfied any qualifying conditions for membership). Of the total membership, 8 million are employed in private industry and 4 million in the public seotor (central and local govern-ment and the nationalised industries). The Government welcome thisgrowth in occupational pension provision and recognise the important rolewhich occupational schemes now play, not only in provision for old age(and to some extent for widowhood and sickness) but as a source of the savings needed to finance investment.120. The new State scheme must provide comprehensive benefits for thepopulation as a whole including in particular provision for families and aguarantee that the real value of pensions will be maintained after award which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for funded occupational schemesfully to reproduce. It would be still more difficult to rely on occupational schemes being able to match any increases in the level of State pensions in payment which went beyond maintaining their real value. But occupational schemes can be individually framed, in a way that the State scheme cannot,to meet the special requirements of particular industries and employments.They can in this way both complement and supplement the universal Stateprovision. Membership of a good occupational scheme is commonly a highly valued feature of an employment.121. The contribution and investment income of occupational schemes hasincreased over the years more than their expenditure on benefits, and therehas been a steady increase in accumulated funds. Table 5 shows theestimated total income and expenditure of occupational schemes for theyears 1963 and 1967, based on the results of special surveys for those yearsconducted by the Government ActuaryC).(!)

These savings account at present for more than one-third of total personal savings and more than a tenth oftotal net savings.122. The new funds accumulated in 1967 by self-administered schemes(that is, schemes other than those conducted by insurance companies) wereinvested as follows: 12 per cent in United Kingdom Government andlocal authorities securities; 59 per cent in company securities ; and 29per cent in investments of other kinds. These schemes account for about two-thirds of all occupational pension funds, from which it can be seenthat the funds occupational schemes are administering play an importantfinancial role, helping to finance investment by private industry as well asinvestment by public authorities and other bodies.123. Personal savings are of economic importance because, by limitingconsumption, they permit the expansion of investment needed for growth and productivity to be made without inflationary pressure. Growth in occupational pension funds has in the past made an important contributionto these savings. This growth derives from four factors: growth in member-ship ; expansion in the scale of provision, resulting in higher contributions(as a proportion of earnings) towards more generous future benefits ; theextent to which new schemes are still at the stage when funds are being built up while there is little expenditure yet on benefits; and the fact thatwhen incomes are rising current contributions relate to higher earningsthan current pensions, which are based on former earnings.124. The growth in the number of members may have slackened recently.There is however still room for a further increase in membership, which isexpected to occur particularly among women ; but as coverage is now fairlywide, future growth may well be smaller than in the recent past. Contribu-tion income is continuing to grow both because of rising earnings and becauseof the increasing scale of provision; and some further expansion can beexpected. The effects of the recent rapid expansion will also be felt for agood many years to come. Thus it is likely that occupational pension schemes will continue for some time to provide an important source of savings.125. In contrast to most occupational schemes, the State scheme willcontinue to be financed on the pay-as-you-go principle (see paragraph 43).TABLE 5
The contributions to it will therefore largely be used to finance currentpayments of benefit and will not contribute in the long run to net savings in the same sense as funded occupational schemes do while they areexpanding. From the point of view of the national economy, therefore,occupational schemes and the State scheme are complementary to each other.126. For all these reasons, there is no question of the new State provisionreplacing occupational schemes. On the contrary, its structure will leaveample scope for their continued development. Occupational schemes havean important part to play alongside the new State scheme, and in its widestsense national superannuation must embrace occupational as well as Statepensions. As has been made clear in chapter 2, the Government^ aim isthat of working in partnership. It is against this background that the need to place a ceiling on the earnings to which employees&apos; contributions to theState scheme are related (see paragraph 30), and the desirability of allowingsome contracting out of the new scheme, have to be considered.The present system of contracting out127. Under the present national insurance scheme, no contracting out is allowed from either the short-term benefits or the basic flat-rate pension.The present scheme&apos;s only contracting-out provision applies to the graduatedadditions to the flat-rate pension which were introduced in 1961. Atthat time graduated contributions applied to that part of a person&apos;s earningslying between  9 and  15 a week. An employer was allowed to contract out those of his employees who were qualifying under an occupational scheme for at least as much pension on retirement as they could have obtained by contributing at the maximum earnings level  15 a week under the State graduated scheme. Contracted-out employees and their employers paid no graduated contributions but became liable for higherflat-rate contributions than other employees and employers. If an employeewho had been contracted out left his employment without being guaranteedthe necessary occupational pension, his employer had to buy him back intothe State scheme by paying the appropriate balance of graduated contribu-tions.128. The maximum level of earnings taken into account under the graduated scheme went up from  15 to  18 a week in 1963, and the amountof pension which contracted-out employees had to be guaranteed fromtheir occupational schemes was increased correspondingly.129. In 1966, the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits bythe present Government made it necessary to charge employer and employeean additional contribution of per cent each on that part of an employee&apos;earnings between  9 and  30 a week. This contribution is payable whetherthe employee is contracted out or not; and so for the first time contracted-out employees have come within the scope of graduated liability. Thebasis of contracting out was not affected, since the difference in amountbetween the contributions paid for contracted-out employees and for other employees and the difference between the State pensions of people in thesetwo categories have remained unchanged.130. The number of employees contracted out has risen from 4  million in 1961 to about 5\ million at present (nearly 3 million of whom are inthe public service or nationalised industries).
314Why the present contracting-out arrangements cannot be carried over intothe new scheme131. The present method of contracting out involves replacing the element of graduated pension, but not the basic flat-rate pension, by a pensionfrom an occupational scheme. Irrespective of an employee&apos;s actual earningshe must be assured by his employer, either through the occupational scheme or by an appropriate payment into the State scheme, of a pension of aboutIs. 4d. a week for each year of contracted-out service, corresponding to the extra State pension obtainable by contributions over the full earnings rangecovered by graduated pension contributions. It follows that an employeeearning less than  18 a week is guaranteed a higher pension through havingbeen contracted out than he would have obtained under the State scheme at his particular earnings level. In the new scheme, however, the range of earnings on which the new percentage contributions will be payable is somuch greater that it would be out of the question to continue to require the employer to disregard the actual earnings of the contracted-out employeeand to provide even for the lowest earner a pension at the maximum levelof the State scheme.132. Any new form of contracting out must therefore require the employer to guarantee pensions for his contracted-out employees related to theiractual earnings. But, even so, a system whereby contracted-out schemeshad to offer a complete substitute for the State pension would be well beyond the scope of most occupational schemes. First, they would haveto match the new State scheme&apos;s weighted pension formula and twenty-yearmaturity neither of which would fit easily into occupational schemes.Secondly, those schemes which do not base their pensions on final salarywould have to match the regular revaluation of an employee&apos;s past earningsrecord which the State scheme will provide, resulting in a steady increasein his pension rights in respect of past as well as current service ; and allschemes would have to match the improvements made under the state scheme in pensions after award. In other words, whenever increases weremade in the State soheme&apos;s benefits to take account of changes in earningsstandards or living costs, employers running completely contracted-outschemes would have to review their own provisions and, if necessary,make corresponding adjustments so as to ensure that their employees didnot lose any improvement in pension rights granted either during service or after retirement. All this would mean that, by contracting out, an employer would be taking on commitments which were large in themselves,and of quite a different order from those which contracting out at presentinvolves. He would also be accepting in advance additional liabilities whichcould not be predicted at all exactly, as they would depend upon futureincreases in the general level of prices and earnings.133. A few schemes of a specialised kind might nevertheless be able tooffer a benefit which was a complete substitute for the State scheme&apos;pension, though very complex transitional arrangements would be needed to ensure that people did not lose the benefit they had already contributedfor under the present State scheme. But in the Government^ view the possi-bility of any such provision has to be dismissed on broader grounds. Eitherit would have to be the only arrangement for contracting out, in which case
315the facility would be outside the compass of the great majority of occupa-tional schemes ; or there would have to be an alternative system for contracting out, more suitable for the generality of private schemes, which did not require them to match the full provision of the State scheme. A two-tier arrangement of this kind would be much too complicated. The samewould be true of any proposal to extend the scope of contracting out beyondthe personal retirement pension. Contracting out of the range of benefitscovering sickness and unemployment would be impracticable in any event;and even if it proved practicable to extend contracting out to cover thewidowhood and dependency benefits which will be financed, like pensions,from the National Superannuation Fund, this would restrict very consider-ably the number of schemes capable of contracting out. It would clearlylead to extensive complications if employers were offered a choice of con-tracting out of either all the benefits provided from the National Super-annuation Fund, or the personal pension alone. This being so, the realpoint at issue is whether the new scheme should offer a facility for partialcontracting out that is, an arrangement whereby occupational schemescould take over responsibility for a defined part of the personal retirement pension which would otherwise be paid by the State.The case for partial contracting out134. There are arguments both for and against a system of partialcontracting out. Considerations of simplicity of operation and administrativeeconomy tell against it. And it might be argued on more general grounds that it would be acceptable for all employees to participate fully in the state scheme, with occupational schemes left free to &quot; live on top &quot;. This is the pattern generally found abroad. In support of this approach, it could besaid that occupational schemes best serve their members to the extent thatthey offer something additional to what can be provided under the state system; and that there would still remain ample scope for this for manyemployees. Within the range of earnings covered by the State scheme thereis no inherent advantage for a pensioner if part of his income comes from anoccupational rather than a State source.135. The Government have however noted the strongly held view amongsome of those concerned with occupational pension schemes that contracting out would help to spread the burden of the growing cost of pensions moreevenly over successive generations of contributors. As explained in para-graph 43, the National Superannuation Fund will be financed on the pay-as-you-go principle, which has the broad effect that contributions of eachgeneration of contributors are used to pay for the pensions of the precedinggeneration. While the initial contribution rates for National Superannuationwill be fixed at a level which is sufficient to finance the growing expenditureof the Fund for some years ahead, increases will thereafter be necessary.Although contributors who were contracted out of part of the State pensionprovision would pay total contributions comparable to those paid by those not contracted out, part of this total would not be paid to the State scheme.The immediate effect of contracting out would be to shorten the initial period during which the income of the National Superannuation Fund will exceedits outgo and therefore to require contribution rates to be increased earlier
than would otherwise be the case. But in the longer term, since lowerpensions would be paid from the National Superannuation Fund to thosewho had been contracted out, there would be a growing offset to the loss of contribution income.136. There is a further sense in which it is sometimes argued that con-tracting out would help to reduce the burden of pensions on later generations.The claim on goods and services represented by future pensions will have tobe met out of future production. Apart from certain public sector schemes,occupational schemes which are contracted out need to be financed onfunding principles, whereby financial provision is made during the con-tributor&apos;s working lifetime through the accumulation and investment of hiscontributions for the pension which will become payable during his old age whereas a State scheme, financed on the pay-as-you-go principle, will not itself generate additional investment of this sort. Since contracting out wouldnot only reduce the extent to which pension provision under the State schemeis substituted for existing occupational provision but also enable some new pension provision to be occupational rather than State, it is held that itwould assist to maintain and indeed increase the flow of savings fromoccupational schemes. It is argued that this would be an advantageousmethod of increasing the funds directly channelled to productive investment and so of ensuring a bigger growth of resources which would help to reducethe burden of pensions on future generations while at the same time the disturbance of the capital markets which might follow a large cut-back ofexisting occupational schemes would be avoided.137. In any event, the new State scheme will inevitably face occupational schemes with formidable problems of adjustment. If there were no con-tracting-out facility, some employers and employees might be prepared topay for both the new State pension and full occupational benefit; but themore likely reaction would be to offset the higher State contributions by reducing future payments to the occupational scheme. If this happenedthe scale and rate of growth of occupational schemes would be reduced and this could lead to the winding up of some of them. This in turn wouldinvolve a corresponding diminution of their contribution to savings. a contracting-out facility would limit the impact of the new State scheme onthe level of occupational provision, and this would ease the situation. Itwould also assist the continued growth of occupational schemes and encourage employers who might otherwise have been deterred from startingnew schemes to go ahead with them. Nor need administrative difficultiesblock the way ; the present contracting-out arrangements, which have beenin operation since 1961, have provided a valuable basis of experience whichshould enable the additional complications arising from any future system to be tackled with a reasonable measure of assurance. These considerationsall lead the Government to favour the inclusion of a contracting-out facilityin the new scheme.A scheme for partial contracting out138. Preliminary study has suggested the following as the pattern forpartial contracting out. The national superannuation contribution paid bycontracted-out employees, and that part of the employer^ contribution on earnings up to the employees&apos; &quot; ceiling &quot; (see paragraph 55), would be at a
lower percentage than would be payable for employees in general. Ascounterpart, there would be a deduction from the personal retirement pension which the contracted-out employee would receive under the State scheme.The occupational scheme would be required to guarantee him a pension of at least the amount deducted from his State pension. This arrangement would affect only the personal retirement pension (and not dependencyor widowhood cover, which would be available in full to those contracted out) and there would be no requirement for contracted-out occupationalIschemes to match various special features of the State scheme, such as its weighted pension formula and twenty-year maturity. Because the occupational scheme would be assuming responsibility for only part ofthe personal retirement pension, and the State scheme would still beproviding all its other benefits in full, contracted-out employees andtheir employers would of course still need to pay the major part of thenormal contribution to the National Superannuation Fund. The financial implications for the National Superannuation Fund of such an arrangementare discussed by the Government Actuary in Appendix 2.139. The formula linking the deduction from contributions to the deduction from pension would be fixed in such a way that the total amount by whichcontributions were reduced for employer and employee together repre-sented, on average, the commercial cost of providing the pension for whichthe occupational scheme was taking over responsibility from the State. Themain factors to be taken into account in fixing the formula would be the accumulation of interest of an invested fund, mortality, and the age distribu-tion and earnings of contracted-out employees. With pension ages for menand women remaining at 65 and 60 respectively (see paragraph 60) therewould have to be a separate formula for women, incorporating either a highercontribution reduction than for men or a smaller pension reduction. Theworking of the arrangements would need to be examined regularly andthe formula might need to be adjusted as some of the relevant factorschanged over time.140. While a system on these lines should be technically feasible, it would raise a number of problems. The first would arise through the dynamicelement in the new State scheme, since any form of contracting out mustplainly leave each contracted-out employee no worse off than if he had remained fully within the State system. This would be essential because,although the employer would be required to give the employees concerned the opportunity to consider the matter beforehand, the final decision whether to contract out his occupational scheme must (as now) remain with him. Onthe other hand it would not be tolerable for an employee&apos;s overall pension rights to be diminished because his employer had chosen to take him outof a part of the State scheme.141. At present there is no difficulty in ensuring that an employee can-not lose any of his personal pension rights by becoming contracted out,since he can only be contracted out of a part of the State schemewhich is entirely fixed in cash terms. Achieving the same result under thenew, dynamic State scheme is bound to be more difficult, as it becomes necessary to decide who should be responsible for guaranteeing a contracted-out employee those improvements in his overall entitlement which he would
have received under the State scheme. The natural answer would perhapsappear to be for this to be entirely the employees responsibility ; but hewould then have to take on an unknown commitment which would dependon future movements in price and earnings levels and, as recognised inparagraph 132, this would present very real difficulties.142. Some difficulties may also be encountered in the settlement of terms which can be generally accepted as fair to all parties that is, to contribu-tors not contracted out as well as to those who are. As explained in para-graph 170, a contracting-out facility would mean an immediate loss of income to the National Superannuation Fund, as the result of which the rates of contribution payable by everyone would have to be increased earlier than would otherwise have been necessary. It would be particularly importanttherefore to be able to assure the generality of contributors that the contri-butions of the contracted out had been reduced by no more than was needed to meet the cost of providing for that part of the State pension for which the occupational scheme was assuming responsibility.143. Further, the formula linking the contribution and pension deductionswould have to be based on an estimate of future trends over a period in anumber of factors, including the rate of interest. Even a small misjudgmentin the initial terms could mean either that the State pensions of contracted-out employees were being provided, to some extent, at the expense of othercontributors, or, conversely, that the cost of contracting out was set so highthat only limited use was made of the facility, which would then no longeroffer a satisfactory basis for partnership between the State and private pro-vision. On the other hand, the contracting-out arrangements would havea better chance of working smoothly, and being generally understood and accepted as fair, if the formula were adjusted as infrequently as possible.144. Finally, if employees are to rely on occupational schemes to providea substantial part of the pension they would otherwise have received fromthe State scheme, adequate safeguards will be needed to ensure that no scheme is used for contracting out unless soundly based. In view of theincreased contingent liabilities which contracting out under the new scheme would involve, it would be right to consider whether safeguards are neededbeyond those which operate at present.Public service pensions145. Of the 12 million or so people who are members of occupational pension schemes, about 4 million are employed in the public sector and 3 million of these are contracted out of the present graduated pension scheme.They include employees of the nationalised industries, the public services(civil servants, teachers, police, firemen and the staff of local authorities andthe National Health Service) and the Armed Forces. The basic provisionsof many of the main public sector pensions schemes are alike: they providefor a maximum pension, at the normal retiring age, of forty eightieths of salary averaged over the last three years (one eightieth for each year ofservice) plus a lump sum of one hundred and twenty eightieths, or the approxi-mately equivalent pension benefit of forty sixtieths with a right to commuteup to a quarter. Arrangements have been made in successive Pensions(Increase) Acts periodically to increase pensions already being paid to retiredmembers of the public services. Increases on a similar pattern have also been
paid to pensioners in many other parts of the public sector (including the armed Forces) to which these Acts do not directly apply. Recently manyschemes in the private sector have also found it possible to augment thepensions of their retired members, but the latest survey undertaken by theGovernment ActuaryO) suggests that the public sector is ahead of private sector practice in this respect.146. As in the private sector, many public sector schemes (for example,in the nationalised industries and most of those in the public services) arecontributory, but a few are non-contributory (the Civil Service and the armed forces) and are financed by the Government on a pay-as-you-go basis.147. Schemes on these lines, giving relatively high pension fractions andrelating pensions to earnings in the few years before retirement, are commonjin both the private and public sectors and will pose a problem as Statepensions build up to the substantial levels to be provided in the new scheme.Some re-alignment of their terms may be necessary.148. In the areas where the Government have an additional responsibility in their role as employer, they intend that these matters should be discussedfully with staff interests. In the Civil Service, following the recommendations on various pensions questions by the Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Fulton(2), a joint committee has already been set up to review thewhole basis of superannuation, with representatives of management and staff, including the industrial trade unions concerned. The implications ofthe new State scheme will be taken fully into account in the course of this review.   The position of the Armed Forces will also have to be considered.Winding up of the present contracting-out arrangements and adaptation of occupational schemes149. Because a contracting-out facility under the new scheme will haveto be on a different basis from the present arrangements, rights acquiredfrom contracted-out employment up to the start of the new scheme will need to be properly determined and safeguarded where necessary by means of adeferred pension or an appropriate payment into the State scheme. There will,in addition, need to be statutory provision to help some occupational schemes to adapt to the new State provision, so that those responsible forthem are not prevented from making necessary modifications because of legalcomplications.Conclusion150. Although the main lines of development are clear, a number ofimportant issues remain to be settled in relation to a new system of con-tracting out of the State scheme. In advance of legislation, therefore, theGovernment intend to discuss these matters with representatives of occupa-tional schemes and others concerned. The Government are confident that,given that all concerned are prepared to play their part in resolving theevident difficulties, fair and workable arrangements can be made for a systemof partial contracting out to accompany the introduction of the new state scheme.C1) Occupational Pension Schemes: Third Survey by the Government Actuary, H.M.S.O.1968.(2) Report of the Committee on the Civil Service, Cmnd. 3638,1968, paras. 136 to 139 and appendix H.
CHAPTER 6PRESERVATION AND TRANSFERABILITY OF occupational pension rights the background151. The importance of occupational pension schemes has been referredto in chapters 2 and 5, which discussed the provision of a contracting-outfacility in the new State scheme. It has been made clear that the Govern-rnent attach considerable importance to the well-being of occupational schemes and see them as continuing to play a vital part alongside the state scheme.152. The 65,000 occupational schemes vary greatly in size, scope and methodof financing, and in their detailed provisions. Their variety reflects the factthat they are often individually framed to meet the needs of particular occu-pations or employments. But, considered collectively, they suffer from aconsiderable defect there are no universal or comprehensive arrangementsfor safeguarding pension rights on changes of employment.153. Ideally, when members of occupational pension schemes change jobs,they should be given the opportunity of transferring accrued rights fromone pension scheme to another thus acquiring in the new scheme benefitsequivalent to those they possessed in the old. Pension rights would accumulateand move with the individual from one employment to another, finallyproviding a single pension on retirement.154. While transfer arrangements between particular pension schemes doexist (and are common within the public sector) information collected by theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Department shows that, in practice, a transfer value in respect of their pension rights is paid for only a small proportion ofthose changing jobs. In 1963 only about 5 per cent of those leavingpublic sector employment and about 1 per cent of those leaving private sector employment had their rights transferred in this way. Rights weresafeguarded by the grant of deferred pensions to 2 per cent of those leavingpublic sector employment and 8 per cent of those leaving private sectoremployment. Thus in public and private sectors together, pension rights weresecured by one or other of these methods in less than 10 per cent of cases.Of the remainder over 90 per cent about three-quarters received a refundof their contributions to the occupational scheme, while the rest received no benefit from their membership of the scheme (other than a gratuity in asmall number of cases). There is no indication that the position has changedsubstantially since 1963.155. The reports published by the Government ActuaryC) make it clearthat the rules of a substantial proportion of schemes do provide for thepossibility of safeguarding pension rights by provision of a deferred pensionor payment of a transfer value.  But a majority of members who could have(!) See footnote to para. 121.
exercised an option to take a deferred pension preferred to withdraw their contributions, while the mere possibility of paying a transfer value (which exists for 40 to 50 per cent of members of private sector schemes) does not mean that transfer arrangements between two schemes will in practice be negotiated. The difficulty of negotiating such arrangements is referredto below.Previous consideration of the safeguarding of pension rights156. The National Economic Development Council discussed this problem in 1964 and suggested that the Minister of Labour&apos;s National Joint AdvisoryCouncil (NJ.A.C.) was an appropriate forum for a full examination of allthe considerations involved. The Council decided to appoint a specialcommittee to report on the economic and social implications of existing arrangements for preservation of pension rights on change of employment, thedesirability of extending such arrangements and the means of doing so. TheCommittee&apos;s report was published in 19660-157. The Committee concluded that there were strong social arguments for more extensive arrangements for the safeguarding of pension rights. Theextent to which the present situation discouraged mobility of labour was, they believed, limited; but it applied particularly to middle-aged employees inrelatively well-paid jobs. The Committee favoured action to preserve pension rights on change of employment, by the provision of deferred pensions.They did not believe that it was feasible to require universal transferabilityof pension rights.158. The Government have given very careful consideration to the reportof the Committee and to all aspects of the problem. In particular they havelooked at the possibility of requiring complete transferability of pension rights.The practical difficulties, many of which were set out in the Committee&apos;sreport, are very great. Transferability of pension rights depends on determination-ing the value of the rights accrued in the first scheme and establishing therights these values represent in the second. Even when two schemes are broadly similar it may not be easy to negotiate satisfactory transfer arrange-ments ; the number and variety of occupational pension schemes make it extremely difficult to devise rules of universal application. It would not be feasible to bring about transferability of pension rights between all schemes,either by direct legislation or by other means, except as part of a muchmore general control of pension schemes, which might disrupt many ofthem. Further, in many cases a change of job involves moving from employment covered by an occupational scheme to employment where no scheme exists. While the Government hope to see a continuing spread of transfer arrangements they have concluded that it is not at present possibleto achieve universal transferability of occupational pension rights.Proposals159. The Government believe, however, that the situation must be im-proved. It is clearly unsatisfactory that individuals who have been membersof an occupational pension scheme, perhaps for many years, should find onchanging jobs that they are obliged to forfeit their pension rights.(i) See footnote to para. 49.
322160. The new State scheme, when fully operative, will generally providemuch better pensions than now. However, an employee changing jobsshould, for both social and economic reasons, be able to retain the additionalpension rights for which he has qualified in an occupational scheme. It isthe Government^ intention to bring in legislation to ensure that every member of an occupational pension scheme who has satisfied certain minimumqualifying conditions shall have the right to have his accrued pensionpreserved for him until he reaches retiring age.161. However, many complex points have first to be decided. these include, how to define a method of calculating accrued pension rights whichwill be of universal application, and whether the preservation requirementshould apply to pensions accrued before the operative date of the new legis-lation. On this second point, if the preservation requirement applied only torights accruing after the operative date of the legislation it would be manyyears before the objects of preservation were fully met. On the other hand,the fullest consideration will need to be given to the financial burden which any retrospective requirement would impose on schemes.162. A further point of principle concerns the right of an employee on leaving his job to withdraw the contributions which he himself has paid into an occupational pension scheme. Such a right is an almost universal feature of contributory schemes, whether or not the schemes give an employee analternative right to have his accrued pension transferred or preserved. Thereare some who argue that the option to withdraw contributions should beremoved and that preservation of pensions should be compulsory in all cases.In general, the report of the N.J.A.C. Committee took this view.163. On the other hand, the right to withdraw contributions is prized by many individuals who may find a cash sum at the time of greater importance than a deferred pension. Pensions accruing under the State scheme will notbe jeopardised by changes of employment and will ensure for the greatmajority a State pension on which they can live in retirement. In thesecircumstances the Government see considerable merit in leaving the individualfree to decide whether to have his occupational pension preserved or towithdraw his contributions. Their view is therefore that while contributoryschemes should he subject to the requirement to offer preservation arrange-ments, they should be allowed to provide for an employee to withdraw hiscontributions on leaving if he prefersC). The Government would howeverregard it as important that a withdrawing employee should be given a clear statement of the value of the alternative options open to him.Consultation164. Before introducing legislation, the Government intend to discuss thesematters with representatives of occupational schemes and others concerned.In view of the widespread agreement that action is needed to ensure the safe-guarding of occupational pension rights they are confident that, despite thepractical difficulties to be overcome, arrangements can be worked out whichwill represent a marked advance on the present situation.(!) Withdrawal could not of course be permitted of any contributions paid towards that part of an occupational scheme pension which an employer had guaranteed to provide inorder to contract the employee concerned out of the new State scheme.
www32PART IVCHAPTER 7THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC implications of THE NEW SCHEMEFinancial implications165. Under the existing scheme all national insurance contributions are paid into one fund and all national insurance benefits are paid out of it.Under the new scheme, as explained in paragraph 52, this single fund willbe replaced by two funds, the National Superannuation Fund and the social insurance Fund. Each fund will receive the appropriate proportion of thetotal contribution income, including the Exchequer contribution. The moneyaccumulated in the funds including the present scheme&apos;s reserves, which willbe divided between them will bring in interest which will, as now, help towards meeting the scheme&apos;s expenditure.166. As shown in Table 6 in the Memorandum by the Government Actuaryon the finance of the proposals (Appendix 2) the cost of the scheme will grow as the full rates of pension come gradually into payment over the first twenty years, and as the proportion of pensioners receiving the full ratesincreases.167. In principle the new scheme, like the present one, will be financedon a &quot; pay-as-you-go &quot; basis that is, with current income designed to meetcurrent expenditure. Most people must expect, however, to pay more fortheir higher benefit prospects. Furthermore, frequent changes in the percentagecontribution rates ought to be avoided, especially in the early years when thescheme is settling down. The initial national superannuation contributionrates proposed (see paragraphs 56 and 58) leave room, therefore, for thegrowth of expenditure for some years ahead.168. The result is that there will be a surplus of income over outgo inthe National Superannuation Fund at the outset of the new scheme. how long this position will last depends upon the actual levels of income andoutgo ; and these in turn depend on a number of factors. Most importantamong these are: the extent to which, over the years, the growing national income will permit improvements in the real value of pensions after award ;the arrangements for contracting out; and the number of employees coveredby these arrangements.169. The two-yearly reviews of pensions in payment (see paragraph 101)will ensure that, as a minimum, they are raised sufficiently to compensate for any rise in prices. The costings of the new scheme have been done interms of April 1968 earnings levels. They therefore illustrate what therelative growths of income and expenditure would be if pensions in paymentwere always to rise in line with earnings.  However, the figures do not take
324account of contracting out. Because decisions have still to be taken on the degree of contracting out in the scheme, the Government Actuary has givenestimates of what the position would be if there were no contracting out at all,accompanied by an indication of the effect of each I per cent a side by whichthe contribution was reduced for those contracted out. (See Appendix 2,paragraph 14.)170. The Government Actuary estimates that with contributions at theproposed level, and before making any allowance for contracting out, the accumulated National Superannuation Fund would reach a maximum of about 3,400 million (in addition to its share of the present reserves) in 1987-88,the year in which expenditure would exceed income for the first time.The contribution rates would then need to be increased somewhat, tomaintain income in line with expenditure, on the pay-as-you-go principle.If the numbers contracted out were the same as at present, the point at which expenditure first exceeded income would be advanced by about 18 monthsf or every J per cent a side by which the contribution was reduced for thosecontracted out, and the maximum size of the fund would be correspondingly reduced.171. Against the expenditure on pensions there will be some savingbecause of the gradual reduction in the number and amounts of supplementary benefits in payment to pensioners. It is not possible to provide any accurateforecast of these savings. Expenditure on supplementary benefits is at present about  450 million a year (of which over  200 million is for pensioners). Theprospect is that, in terms of 1968 levels, this will decline after the start of theinew scheme, though only slowly during the first decade or so, with the probability that by the turn of the century expenditure or supplementary benefits will be at a very much lower level.Economic implications172. The main purpose of the new scheme is to raise the standard ofliving of pensioners, both absolutely and in relation to the rest of thepopulation. It is estimated that at present national insurance and supple-mentary benefits provide pensioners with about a third of the average income of the rest of the populationC). Other sources provide about a further third,so that the average income of pensioners is now around two-thirds of that ofthe rest of the population ; but there are wide variations on either side ofthese average levels.173. When the new scheme has been running long enough for the bulk of pensioners to be receiving pensions at the fully mature new rates that is,some time after the turn of the century the pensions provided might amounton average to nearly half the average income of the rest of the population.This would mean that, even if the relative provision from other sources were no greater than now, the average income of pensioners would approach80 per cent of that of the working population.174. The improvement in the relative standard of living of pensioners willnot be spread evenly throughout the retired population, but will tend to be concentrated on the groups with fewest resources beyond their State retire-(!) In estimating average income per person, children are counted as a half.
ment pension. Those who will gain most will be the widows, who often haveno appreciable other income of their own.175. At present, pensioners account for 10 per cent of total personal consumption, and the rest of the population for 90 per cent. The projectedincrease in the living standards of pensioners might raise their share of personal consumption to about 12 per cent by the turn of the century, thus reducing the share available to the rest of the population by about 2 per cent of the total.176. The reduction in the share of personal consumption going to theworking population represents the real burden of the new pension scheme.From the point of view of each contributor, the scheme implies some post-ponement of consumption from the working years to the years of retirement.For the community as a whole, what is available for personal consumption atany one time is determined by the potential size of the total national productand by the claims of investment, public services and exports. As long as thescheme does not result in an increase in the total proportion of the national income devoted to personal consumption, there should be no adverse effecton productivity or employment, or on future economic growth.177. The extra burden on the working population which the new schemeinvolves will come about gradually over a period of 30 years or more, duringwhich living standards can be expected to rise by at least 2 per cent a year on average, or by a total of some 80 per cent over 30 years. If they do so rise, theintroduction of the new scheme might mean that workers&apos; living standardswould increase by 77 per cent rather than 80 per cent. In other words, at anyrate of economic growth comparable with what has been achieved in recentyears, the increase in pensioners&apos; living standards should not be felt by theworking population as an appreciable burden.178. As explained in paragraph 167, the Government have decided that atthe start of the scheme the level of contributions should be somewhat higherthan is necessary to meet the expected current expenditure. The resultingsurplus in the scheme&apos;s early years will have a restraining effect on the pressure of demand, and thereby enable any given level,of public expenditure to be financed with a somewhat smaller recourse to general taxation. Theextent of this easement will depend on how far the surplus is offset by any consequential reduction in private savings as a whole, including savingsthrough occupational pension schemes. It would be prudent to assume, at anyrate initially, that there will be some effect on occupational pension schemes which will not be fully offset by increases in other forms of private saving.179. It is estimated that the increase in employers&apos; contributions to 6f percent of earnings (including their contributions to the Redundancy Fund)implies an increase of about \ per cent in total labour costs, which in turn taking both direct and indirect effects into account may increase thegeneral level of prices by a similar percentage. There may thus be a smalladverse impact on the balance of payments when the new scheme begins.Conclusion180. The new scheme requires people to spread their incomes more evenlythroughout their lives, so that they have somewhat less during working life and substantially more during retirement.   From the social point of view,
- 326it implies a long-term commitment, by the Government on behalf of thecommunity as a whole, to reduce substantially the present gap between the living standards of the working population and the retired population. this change will come about gradually ; and it will still leave the working popula-tion able to look forward to a steady improvement in their living standards.
APPENDIX further NOTES ON THE NEW scheme. This Appendix contains further notes on the following aspects of the new scheme (1) The assessment of employees&apos; contributions.(2) Administrative consequences of the new earnings-related contributions.(3) The assessment of employers&apos; contributions.(4) Pension ages.(5) The retirement condition and earnings rule.(6) The transition from present-scheme pensions to new-soheme pensions.(7) Credited earnings.(8) Pension provision for married women.(9) The practical difficulties of applying earnings-relation to the self-employed.(10) Contribution arrangements for low earners and non-earners.2. Except where otherwise stated, all paragraph references are to the main text of the White Paper.(1) The assessment of employees&apos; contributions(See paragraph 54)3. The present graduated contributions are assessed on the amount of payreceived by the employee in each week (or other pay period) taken by itself.This means that employees whose pay is sometimes above and sometimes belowthe scheme&apos;s earnings ceiling may pay substantially less in contributions, andqualify in consequence for lower pensions, than others with the same totalearnings spread more evenly over the year.4. The new schemed method of assessment will avoid this unfairness. the employee will contribute on the whole of his earnings in the employment in eachtax year, as he receives them, up to the annual earnings ceiling. The 7 per centor so of employees whose earnings reach the ceiling in any year will then payno further contributions until the following tax year. This method of assessmentwill ensure that the total amount of the employee&apos;s earnings which ought to countfor benefit is always matched by the amount of his contributions. It will also besimpler than the present system, which necessarily applies different ceilings to,for example, a week&apos;s, a fortnights and a month&apos;s pay.(2) Administrative consequences of the new earnings-related contributions(See paragraph 54)5. The replacement of the present dual system of flat-rate and graduated contributions by the new earnings-related contributions should produce a con-siderable net saving in employers&apos; administrative costs. As with the presentgraduated contributions, the employer will record the contributions on hisemployees&apos; PAYE documents and will remit the amounts to the Collector of taxes. Employers will no longer need to be concerned wiitih national insurancestamps and cards.6. Net savings can also be expected in the administrative costs incurred bythe Government in collecting and recording contributions. A new computercomplex at the Newcastle Central Office of the Department of Health and social Security will keep contributors&apos; records and calculate their pensions. Thiswill supersede the clerical methods of recording used for the present flat-rate contributions.
7. At present the regular statistics of numbers in employment are based onthe number of national insurance cards exchanged by employers each quarter.When the national insurance cards are withdrawn a new method of compilingemployment statistics, probably by means of a simple return from all employers,will be introduced. Tests on the most suitable methods will be carried out inthe next two years.(3) The assessment of employers&apos; contributions(See paragraph 58)8. The absence of an earnings ceiling for employers&apos; contributions means thattheir liability will be assessed on the total pay of their employees, as recordedfor PAYE.   This is both fair and straightforward for employers to operate.9. It might be suggested that employers&apos; contribution liability ought to be tiedstill more closely to that of their employees, by being assessed only on the amountof each employee^ earnings up to the employees&apos; earnings ceiling just as thepresent graduated scheme&apos;s ceiling applies to employers&apos; as well as employees&apos;contributions. In the new scheme, however, with contributions assessed on anannual basis (see paragraph 4 of this Appendix), an earnings ceiling for employers&apos;contributions is not only unnecessary but would have undesirable effects. Therewould, for instance, be no satisfactory way of apportioning contribution liabilitybetween employers (whether by refund or otherwise) in cases where an employeewhose total earnings in the year exceeded the annual ceiling had received thoseearnings in more than one employment whether because he had changed jobs in the course of the year or because he worked regularly for more than oneemployer. In practice the employers&apos; contributions in such cases could not be adjusted by reference to the employees earnings ceiling without making oneemployers liability depend on what the employee had earned with anotheremployer. With no earnings ceiling, for employers&apos; contributions, difficultiesof this kind will not arise. Each employer will contribute solely according tohis own payroll: his liability will be unaffected by any earnings which hisemployees may have in other employments.10. The effect of having no earnings ceiling for employers&apos; contributions hasbeen taken into account in deciding their percentage contribution rate under thenew scheme. As indicated in paragraph 58, an estimated i per cent contribution is needed from employers for the Redundancy Fund. Had their total percentagerate (without an earnings ceiling) for the remaining purposes been made thesame as that paid by employees (with a ceiling), employers as a whole wouldhave paid, at April 1968 earnings levels, about  80 million a year more forthese purposes than employees. The contribution rates actually proposed will reduce this margin to about  30 million a year.(4) Pension ages(See paragraph 60)Meris pension age11. Although some occupational schemes provide pensions before age 65, thereare strong reasons against lowering the present men&apos;s pension age of 65 in theState scheme. Such a move would undoubtedly encourage earlier retirement,when the general need of the countryS economy is for people to continue in work as long as possible; and the increase in pension expenditure and loss of contribution income would be serious.12. On the other hand, the Government do not consider that men&apos;s pension ageshould be raised above 65. This would take away, without good reason, thelong-established right of a man to obtain at that age the pension for whichhe has contributed over many years. The right way to deal with the questionof men retiring later than age 65 is to provide higher pensions for those who doso ; and under the new scheme this will be done as indicated in paragraph 60.Pension age for men will therefore remain at 65.
Women&apos;s pension age &quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;,13. On the grounds of strict equity, it can be argued that women&apos;s pension age should be brought into line with rribat of men, by raising it to 65. Buta social security scheme must take into account the normal family situation.Most men reaching age 65 are married, and on average their wives are about three years younger than they are. Equality of pension age would thereforeusually mean that, when a husband reached pension age and retired, it wouldbe some time, often several years, before the wife could draw any pensionshe herself had earned. This delay would occur even if she had ceasedemployment and was for all practical purposes retired like her husband.14. Nor would raising womehs pension age to 65 produce a large immediatesaving in benefit expenditure. As described in paragraphs 72 to 85, the new scheme, like the present one, must include provision for wives and widows ontheir husbands&apos; records ; the immediate saving would therefore be made primarily on the pensions of single women. At present they form about 12 per cent ofwomen reaching age 60 ; but the proportion is steadily declining and by the endof the century is expected to fall to only about 5 per cent. Moreover, a move from age 60 to 65 would have to be phased gradually over a number of years inorder to avoid hardship and unfairness ; and this would reduce the saving stillfurther.15. The Government therefore do not consider that there is a sufficient case for raising women&apos;s pension age. Leaving it at 60 will normally ensure that, whenhusband and wife effectively become a retired couple, both will be able todraw whatever pension they have earned.(5) The retirement condition and earnings rule(See paragraph 60)16. Since 1946, following a recommendation in the Beveridge Report!1), thenational insurance pension has been, not an old age pension, but a retirement pension: that is, during the first five years after pension age its award is condi-tional on retirement from regular employment. People who defer their retire-ment beyond pension age can qualify for higher pensions when they eventuallyretire.17. The essential purpose of pensions is to replace normal earnings when thesecease at the end of working life ; and the retirement condition accordinglyprevents pensions being paid, on top of earnings, to people who do not retireon reaching pension age. Enforcement of the retirement condition obviouslyrequires some means of preventing a person from obtaining a pension bydeclaring his retirement and then drawing it in full however much work he does.This is the function of the earnings rule, under which, up to age 70 (men) or65 (women), retirement pension is subject to reduction if the pensioner earnsmore than a certain amount. This amount is at present  6 10s. a week ; forthe first  2 a week of earnings beyond this the reduction in pension is 6d. foreach Is. of earnings, and thereafter Is. for each Is. The earnings rule doesno more than adjust the amount of pension payable, according to the pensionersearnings. No limit is placed on the amount of work pensioners may do ; andif a pensioner returns to regular work he can, if he prefers, cancel his retirementand so earn a higher eventual pension. At present, of about H million(2)retirement pensioners to whom the earnings rule applies, about 20,000 are having their pensions reduced or extinguished because they are earning more than  6 10s.a week. At age 70 (men) or 65 (women) both the retirement condition and the earnings rule cease to apply.18. So long as a retirement condition remains, something corresponding tothe present earnings rule is needed to support it; the two stand or fall together.To abolish them would increase the scheme&apos;s expenditure by about  150 million a year initially at April 1968 levels ; and most of this would be spent insupplementing the earnings of some 350,000 people who were still in regular(1) Cmd. 6404, paras. 133 to 136 and 244-5.(2) Counting a married couple as one pensioner, where the wife has a pension on her husband&apos;s insurance.
employment. It is difficult to predict the effect of this on the pattern of workamong people over pension age ; but it might well produce a net decrease ratherthan an increase of employment. Some pensioners would be encouraged to earn more, where circumstances permitted ; but they would be likely to constituteonly a very small proportion of the total, judging from the fact that the vast majority of present pensioners who could be affected by the earnings rule are either not working or else have earnings substantiallly below the point at whichthe earnings rule begins to apply!,1). Increases in employment among somepensioners could be more than offset by a reduction of working hours amongthe 350,000 people still in regular employment, who would find themselves withpensions as well as earnings.19. Taking into account the. economic, financial and social considerations involved, the Government have concluded that, as at present, the State scheme should not provide people in regular employment with pensions merely becausethey have reached the minimum age at which pension can be paid. something like the existing retirement condition and earnings rule will accordingly remain.(6) The transition from present-scheme pensions to new-scheme pensions(See paragraph 61)Pensions for people reaching pension age during the first twenty years of thenew scheme20. As explained in paragraph 61, the pensions for people who reach pension age during the new schemed twenty-year maturity period will be based on theirrecords under both the present flat-rate scheme (the &quot; old scheme &quot;) and the new scheme. Their pensions will be at rates intermediate between the old-scheme rate and the fully mature new-scheme rate. The &quot; old-scheme rate&quot; used in the calculation will be based on the rate currently in payment to old-schemepensioners at the time when the person concerned reaches pension age. The&quot; new-scheme rate &quot; used in the calculation will be the rate obtained by applying the new scheme&apos;s pension formula to the contributor^ average earnings sincethe new scheme began (each years earnings being re-valued as in paragraph 68).After award the total pension calculated in this way will be reviewed every twoyears as described in paragraphs 100 to 103. Any pension earned by contributions to the present graduated scheme will be paid in addition.21. The following examples illustrate how the calculations for a single personwill be made. There will be corresponding calculations for a married couple see paragraph 74. For simplicity, the examples are based on April 1968 levels,both for the old-scheme pension rate ( 4 10s. standard rate for a single person)and for national average earnings ( 22 a week). The corresponding cash amounts in the future will depend on the increases in these two levels which have takenplace meanwhile.Example 1 : A person reaches pension age after the new scheme has been running for five years. His yearly contribution average underthe old scheme is 50 or more, corresponding to full old-schemepension ( 4 10s. a week). His average earnings under the new scheme are the same as the national average of  22 a week ;this average would correspond to a new-scheme pension, at fullmaturity, of  9 7s. a week (see column (3) of Table 3 inparagraph 71).   His pension is therefore (Mx  4 10s.HGATx 9 7s.)^5 14s. a week.This is a quarter of the way between the old-scheme rate of 4 10s. and the fully mature new-scheme rate of  9 7s.(i) See the Report of the National Insurance Advisory Committee on the Question of the earnings Limit for Retirement Pensions (Cmnd. 3197, 1967, paras. 16 to 28 and AppendicesII and III).
Example 2: A person with the same old-scheme and new-scheme&quot;averages asin example 1 reaches pension age after the new scheme hasbeen running for ten years, i.e. half-way through the maturityperiod.  His pension is therefore (MX 4 10s.)-f(igx 9 7s.)= 6 19s. a week.This is half way between the old-scheme rate and the fullymature new-scheme rate.Example 3: A person reaches pension age after the new scheme has been running for fifteen years. His yearly contribution average underthe old scheme is 45, corresponding to old-scheme pension of 4 a week. His average earnings under the new scheme areli times the national average that is,  27 10s. a week ; thisaverage would correspond to a new-scheme pension, at fullmaturity, of  10 15s. a week (see column (3) of Table 3 inparagraph 7.1). His pension is therefore (Ax 4)-f-(Mx 10 15s.)- 9 Is. a week.This is three-quarters of the way between the old-scheme rate and the fully mature new-scheme rate.Pensions for people reaching pension age after the first twenty years of thenew scheme22. The pensions for people who reach pension age after the new scheme&apos;stwenty-year maturity period will be based simply on their average earnings sincethe start of the scheme: that is, they will be entitled to the full new-scheme ratesproduced by the pension formula, without regard to their record under theold scheme.Fall-back rule for certain cases23. For a few people with no or a very low new-scheme record, the phasingout of the old-scheme record over twenty years could result in a smallerpension than they would have received had the old scheme continued. A fall-back rule will be included to prevent a reduction of pension rights in thesecircumstances.(7) Credited earnings(See paragraphs 69, 75, 87 and 89)24. Credited earnings, normally at half the national average, will count for both long-term and short-term benefits as appropriate.25. Where the contributor^ relevant earnings record is less than half thenational average, the amount of earnings credited will be limited correspondingly.Without such a limitation, those low earners who remained on benefit wouldbecome entitled, even though paying no contributions, to higher rates of benefit in the future than others with a similar level of earnings who worked and paid contributions.26. At the other end of the scale, credited earnings will not be allowed tobring a contributor^ record for any year above the ordinary earnings ceiling.(8) Pension provision for married women(See paragraph 72)27. For the reasons explained in paragraph 39, the new scheme will stillprovide many married women and widows with pensions based on their husbands&apos;records. The Government have examined the alternative possibility of creditingthem with earnings for periods in which family responsibilities prevented them from going out to work, so enabling them to build up adequate records of theirown. But special credits of this kind would produce serious difficulties, forthe following reasons:  (1) There could be no real justification for crediting a housewife with earnings unless her circumstances were such as to make it unreasonable
to expect her to go out to work because she had children at home or,for example, was looking after a sick husband. Reliance on creditsrestricted in this way would, however, often mean lower pension entitlement for a wife than is given by the present right to a pension on her husband&apos;s record. It would also involve making very difficultjudgments in individual cases about whether a wife had good reasons,of the kinds laid down, for not going out to work. This would create an immense new burden of claims, decisions, appeals and record-keeping.(2) If earnings were credited to married women at a level sufficient toprovide enough pension for those who, through widowhood or someother cause, were left to fend for themselves, the credit level would necessarily be over-generous for the ordinary case of a wife living with her husband. There could not therefore be one uniform level of creditswhich could be merged with the wife&apos;s earnings in other periods inorder to provide her with a single independent record. The credits would have to be worth different amounts according to the wife&apos;sdomestic circumstances at the time her pension or other benefit was paid a complication hard for those concerned to understand, under an arrangement purporting to provide married women with independentrecords of their own.28. The Government have concluded that there is no satisfactory way inwhich housewives could be credited during marriage with earnings they havenot in fact received, in order to help them acquire pensions independently of their husbands&apos; records. Pensions will therefore continue to be availablefor married women and widows on their husbands&apos; insurance, as described in paragraphs 72 to 85.(9) The practical difficulties of applying earnings-relation to the self-employed(See paragraphs 97 and 98)29. At present about 14. million people come within the self-employedcategory for national insurance. They include a very wide variety of menand women working on their own account, among them people in the variousprofessions, shopkeepers, farmers and others running their own businesses,both large and small. In general they are assessable for income tax under shedule D and do not come under the PA YE systemC1). They are not coveredby the present graduated scheme and therefore pay only flat-rate contribu-tions. Apart from unemployment benefit and industrial injuries benefits, theirrange of benefit cover is the same as for employees.30. There are great practical difficulties in relating the contributions and benefits of self-employed people to their earnings. These difficulties wouldexist whether their contributions were to be calculated on all their earnings up to the ceiling (as is proposed for employees) or, as a supplement to basicflat-rate contributions, only on that part of their earnings which lay above a certain level. An assessment of earnings would be required for many caseswhere, since there is clearly no liability for tax (for example, because of the size of the total personal tax allowances due), no assessment at all is madeat present. In many other cases where only a small amount of tax is a tissue, much more detailed enquiries would have to be made than are requirednow. There is the further problem that to charge earnings-related contributionson the unadjusted figure of profits as assessed for tax under Schedule D would lead to serious anomalies in many cases. This is because the Schedule Dfigure may be affected by factors which ought to play no part in the calculation of contribution liability and benefit entitlement: examples are the tax adjust-ments arising from the way in which a taxpayer has chosen to claim relief for a trading loss, or from the incidence of capital allowances. Additionalcomplications wouid arise because Schedule D tax is in general assessed not(l) Among the minority who do come under the PA YE system, it may be possible to bringsome into the employed category under the new scheme, so bringing the two systems closerinto line.   This is being studied.
33on the current year&apos;s income, to which PAYE applies, but on the income ofthe preceding year. Thus if earnings-related contributions for self-employedpeople were to be linked to the rules which have been found necessary forSchedule D tax assessment, an intricate series of adjustments to the figureof trading profits as determined for income tax would often need to be made before it would provide a reasonable basis for calculating their contributions and benefits.31. All. this extra work would not only increase the strain on the heavilyburdened accountancy profession; it would also require an estimated 2,000or so additional Government staff. A large proportion of these would need to be Inspectors of Taxes, a grade which it is difficult to maintain at thenumbers already required. The amounts of contribution which would result from all this extra effort would often be small. The extra manpower neededwould be still greater if a special new system, outside the tax arrangements,were to be set up for assessing and collecting earnings-related contributions from the self-employed.32. These difficulties rule out earnings-relation for the self-employed, atany rate for the time being. Self-employed people will therefore continue topay contributions at a flat rate. This does not mean that they will be in aseparate scheme. As explained in paragraph 98, their contributions will be counted as equivalent to earnings-related contributions on earnings of halfthe national average, and will be entered in the same records as the contributions for employees.(10) Contributions arrangements for low earners and non-earners(See paragraph 99)33. Where an employee falls outside the scope of the PAYE system, thisis nearly always because his earnings are below the minimum figure to whichPAYE applies at present  5 5s. a week for main employments. something like 14- million people are thought to be in this category at present. Ofthese, probably more than half are married women who have chosen not topay the flat-rate national insurance contribution; many of the others arejuveniles and pensioners. Earnings-related contributions on earnings which are too low to come within PAYE would amount to only a few shillings a week,yielding correspondingly small amounts of benefit. The collection of suchcontributions, whether done by extending the PAYE system or through someseparate machinery, would often be difficult and disproportionately costly. Itis therefore proposed that those whose earnings are too low to come withinPAYE should not be treated as employed persons under the new scheme.Some of those who have more than one such small job will qualify to betreated as self-employed. The others will count as non-employed and so beable to contribute voluntarily as described in paragraphs 36 and 37 of this appendix. All will still be able to qualify, where appropriate, for benefit underthe industrial injuries scheme (entitlement to which does not depend on the employee&apos;s contribution record).&quot; Class 3 &quot; contributions34. Contributions as a non-employed person &quot; class 3 &quot; contributions are paid at present by about a quarter of a million people at any one time, in very varied circumstances. Some class 3 contributions cover no more than aweek or two between jobs, or a period of unpaid holiday. Others are paidover a prolonged period by, for example, women at home looking after their parents, or housewives who, though no longer going out to work, wish to keep up their contribution record so as to qualify for a pension in their own right at age 60. In general class 3 contributions count for all national insurance benefits except unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and maternity allowance.In April 1968 the total class 3 contribution rates were 16s. 7d. a week fornaen and 12s. lid. for women.
35. People without earnings are not easy to fit in as contributors under anearnings-related scheme. But it would be wrong to abolish class 3 con-tributions altogether. This would deprive many present contributors of theright, which they have been exercising for years, to keep up their record for pensions and other benefits at the full standard rates provided by the present scheme. Further, under the new scheme some people will have only a low recordfrom their earnings in a particular year, either because their earnings level is itself low or because they are off work for part of the year in circumstances which do not qualify them to have earnings credited for example, on unpaidholiday. They too need to be able to pay class 3 contributions to prevent an undue reduction in their pension expectation.36. Class 3 contributions will therefore continue under the new scheme,to enable a contributor^ record for any year to be brought up to a certainlevel (but no higher). This level will be set and maintained so as to correspond,at any given time, to new-scheme pension entitlement at whatever is then thestandard rate in force for present-scheme pensioners. The range of benefitcover will remain as described in paragraph 34 of this Appendix. In this wayentitlement to existing rights will be preserved.37. Payment of the present class 3 contributions is compulsory in some circumstances and voluntary in others. The new-scheme class 3 contributions will be voluntary in all cases, since the amount needed to bring a person&apos;sordinary record in any year up to the class 3 level will not usually be knownuntil after the end of that year, and the full amount involved would often thenbe too large for a person with little or no earnings to be required to pay.People will be able to pay either the full year&apos;s amount or a lesser amount;and an adequate period will be allowed for payment. Facilities will also beprovided, through stamped cards or otherwise, for regular payment throughoutthe year by those whose circumstances are sufficiently stable to enable them to foresee how much they will want to pay within the permitted range.
ff*T!APPENDIX 2MEMORANDUM BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARYON THE FINANCE OF THE PROPOSALS1. The cost of the present national insurance scheme is met by contributions from insured persons, employers and the Exchequer, the aim being to ensure,as nearly as practicable, a balance between income and outgo. The existingfunds are merely a reserve at present about 60 per cent of the annual outgo the interest on which makes a small contribution towards the cost of benefits.The proposed scheme will be financed in the long term on the same principles,although the initial contribution will allow for the growth of expenditure over anumber of years ahead and will lead to a moderate surplus in the early years.Basis of the estimates2. In a period of rising earnings, estimates of income and outgo expressed inmonetary terms would need to be compared with estimates of national income ;all such estimates would involve speculative assumptions regarding future ratesof increase of prices and earnings. Contribution income in an earnings-relatedscheme will rise automatically with earnings and, under the proposals, newlyawarded pensions will also reflect rising earnings. It is also intended that,after award, the real value of pensions will at least be maintained when pricesrise. Estimates based on constant earnings give a realistic indication of therelative progress of income and outgo if benefits as well as contributions wereto rise in line with earnings and, following the practice adopted in recent years in reports on the national insurance scheme, this basis has been used for thepresent memorandum.3. The estimates are based on the level of earnings in April 1968 (whennational average earnings were about  22 a week)0- In order that the newearnings related benefits and the flat-rate benefits of the present scheme should beon a comparable basis, the latter have been taken at 31 per cent above the current rates, which came into operation in October 1967, to allow for changes in prices and earnings between that date and April 1968.4. The major costs in the early years of the new scheme will arise frompensions awarded wholly or partly under the provisions of the present scheme,and the conditions under which benefits will be granted will be generally similar tothose applying at present. Rates of claim and other factors have, therefore, been derived from recent experience of the present scheme. On Government instruc-tions an unemployment rate of 2 per cent has been assumed.5. The scheme to which the present estimates relate is described in detail in chapter 3 and Appendix 1. It is proposed that the initial total contribution rate should be 6? per cent of earnings, subject to a ceiling of about 1-J- times national average earnings ( 1,700 a year at April 1968 levels) for employees, with thesame percentage from employers calculated on the employees&apos; earnings withouta ceiling. These rates would cover national superannuation and social insurance benefits, industrial injuries benefits, a contribution towards the cost of theNational Health Service and the employer^ contribution to the RedundancyFund. Appropriate rates of contribution related to the benefits covered will bepaid by self-employed and voluntary contributors. The contributions for thenew scheme will be augmented by Exchequer supplements representing aboutthe same proportion of the total contributions of insured persons and employersas at present.6. Under the new scheme there will be two separate funds, the national superannuation Fund covering retirement pensions, widows&apos; benefits and deathgrant and the Social Insurance Fund covering the other benefits including(i) See footnote (&quot;*) on page 20.
the proposed new attendance allowance. Specific rates of contribution will befixed for the two funds, and the present schemed reserves will be apportionedbetween them when the new scheme comes into operation.7. As indicated in paragraphs 56 and 58, the National Superannuation fund will initially receive contributions of 4J per cent of earnings, subject to a ceiling,from employees, and 4^ per cent of earnings without a ceiling from employers.A contribution of \ per cent of earnings from employers has been allowed for the Redundancy Fund, and 2 per cent a side for the Social Insurance Fund,industrial injuries benefits and the National Health Service.Social Insurance Fund8. In the Social Insurance Fund, long-term sickness benefit will be earnings-related and based on the same formula as retirement pensions. The precisedetails of short-term sickness, unemployment and maternity benefits have notyet been settled, but it is proposed that married women should be entitled tothe full personal rates of sickness and unemployment benefit instead of the reduced rates paid at present, and that employed married women within thescope of PAYE should no longer be able to choose not to contribute andshould thus become eligible for all benefits. It is estimated that, allowing forthese changes, a contribution of 2 per cent of earnings a side, subject to the ceiling for the employee, would be sufficient to maintain a balance of income and outgo in the Social Insurance Fund if short-term benefits are on aboutthe same scale as now and would provide contributions for industrial injuriesbenefits and the National Health Service at about the same level in relationto earnings as at present.9. On the assumption of stable claim rates, the contributions required for theSocial Insurance Fund would remain almost constant for a long period. Thisfund will be particularly susceptible, however, to short-term fluctuations dueto such factors as sickness epidemics or changes in the level of employment andwill need to retain an adequate working balance to meet such contingencies.National Superannuation Fund10. The National Superannuation Fund will cover retirement pensions, widows&apos;benefits and death grant; the full earnings-related pensions awarded after 20years will be based on a formula giving 60 per cent of average earnings up to half national average earnings (about  11 a week at April 1968 levels) and25 per cent of higher earnings up to a ceiling of one and half times national average earnings (about  33 a week, or  1,700 a year, at April 1968 levels).Estimates of the cost of these benefits on the basis of constant earnings, and assuming that the new scheme will come into force in April 1972, are shownin Table 6, together with corresponding figures for the benefits of the present scheme if it were to continue unchanged.

The rising extra cost shown in the table compared with the present benefitsreflects the gradual increase in the average pensions awarded during the twenty-year maturity period and the growing proportion of pensioners in receipt ofnew scheme pensions. The extra cost of widows&apos; benefits includes the cost of paying scaled-down widows&apos; pensions to certain widows whose husbands havedied before the start of the new scheme (see paragraph 81 of the White Paper).12. It is the Governments intention to enter into discussions with interested parties with the object of devising a system of partial contracting out for membersof occupational pension schemes (see chapter 5). It is envisaged that both thepersons covered by such arrangements and their employers will pay lower con-tributions than those for the generality of employees and that there will becorresponding deductions from personal retirement pensions. This will have a material effect on the finances of the scheme, since the reduction in contribu-tions will be felt immediately, but the corresponding saving in expenditure on pensions will emerge only gradually as the individuals concerned come to draw their pensions. Until the terms of contracting out have been fixed and detailsbecome available about the numbers involved it is not possible to estimate whatits effect will be. The estimates shown in the tables make no allowance for contracting out but, in paragraphs 14 and 17 below, some indication is given of the possible effect on the fund.The progress of the fund13. Table 7 shows how the income from contributions of 4^- per cent of earnings, subject to a ceiling, from employees and 4\ per cent of all earnings from employers, together with Exchequer supplements and interest, would exceedoutgo in the early years. The figures, like those in Table 6, are based onconstant earnings. They indicate that, subject to the qualifications set out in thefollowing paragraphs, and before allowing for contracting out, the income, includ-ing interest on the growing fund, would exceed outgo for about 15 years.

As mentioned in paragraph 12 above, contracting out would lead to animmediate reduction in contribution income and a consequent saving in benefitsemerging only gradually. The period during which the National SuperannuationFund will continue to increase will, therefore, be reduced to an extent depending on the numbers of employees who are contracted out, the amount of thereduction of contributions and, to a smaller extent, on the terms finally agreed for relating the reductions of pension to those of contributions. For example,for those at present contracted out (i.e. some 44- million men and   millionwomen), each i per cent a side reduction in the contributions would reducethe period of growth of the fund by about li years, and the maximum size of the fund would be correspondingly reduced.15. The estimates of growth in the fund given in Table 7 and in para-graph 14 above are necessarily speculative, since its progress will be verysensitive to changes in benefit costs and contribution yields which might result from causes other than contracting out. For example, costs of pensions canbe affected by changes in pensioners&apos; mortality rates or by patterns of retire-ment; and in so far as the rate of augmentation of benefits in payment over aperiod might differ from the rate of increase of earnings, there would be a departure from the relative position shown on the basis of constant earnings.Future changes in contribution rates16. The financial position of the scheme will have to be examined from timeto time and adjustments to contributions or benefits may be necessary to meetchanging circumstances. In any event it is to be expected that an increase incontribution rates will be required for the National Superannuation Fund whenthe annual income begins to fall short of outgo. An indication of the con-tributions needed to meet the costs on a pay-as-you-go basis is given in Table 8,which sets out the percentage rates of contribution for certain years assuming that Exchequer supplements are payable at the present proportions. The ratesrepresent the total rates for employees and employers jointly (the employees&apos;rate being subject to a ceiling) on the assumption of constant earnings, but can beassumed to show the rates that would be needed if benefits as well as contribu-tions were to rise in line with earnings. No allowance has been made for interest on the fund built up from the surpluses expected in the early years, but Table 7shows that interest income would be relatively small in relation to benefitexpenditure.

It follows from paragraph 16 above and Table 8 that, before allowing for contracting out, the joint rate of contribution for the National Superannua-tion Fund (initially 91 per cent of earnings) might have to be raised to about10 per cent after 20 years and to about 11 per cent by the end of the century.Contracting out would result in a loss of contributions which for the yearsshown would exceed the saving in benefit expenditure so that the rates in the table might be too low to an extent depending on the numbers contracted out, the rate of increase in earnings, and the terms which might be agreed forthe reductions of contributions and pension. With the present proportionscontracted out the shortfall in the rates of contribution might be of the orderof 0-1 per cent of earnings for each \ per cent a side by which the rate of contribution was reduced.18. Even after 30 years, some pensions in payment will be based wholly or partly on the flat-rate benefits of the present scheme and it is estimated that theaverage pension in payment will still be some 10 per cent lower than the full rate under the new scheme. Other things being equal, therefore, the joint rateof contribution required for the National Superannuation Fund would probably have to be increased by a further 1 per cent of earnings (-j per cent a side)over the early part of the next century to deal with this feature. The actualrate of contribution required at any time, however, is determined not only bythe degree of maturity of the scheme and the other factors referred to in earlierparagraphs, but also by the relative numbers of pensioners and contributors.Estimates for the more distant future will depend to an increasing extent on thenumbers of future births and any estimates of rates of contribution for periodsmore than 30 years ahead would be very speculative.19. The effect of many of the factors which will play an important part inthe development of the scheme will not become clear until it is brought intoforce. For example, the extent to which employers will take advantage of an option to contract out of part of the retirement pension and the age and salaryafter consultation with interested parties. Similar uncertainty applies to theprovision under which voluntary contributions will be paid by workers with very low earnings and others outside the scope of compulsory contributions. Thewhole pattern of claims, particularly for benefits in the Social Insurance Fund,may well be changed by the new benefit provisions and in particular by theinclusion of all employed married women. It will, therefore, be necessary tofollow the development of the scheme and the level of claims particularlycarefully during the early years.Herbert TetleyGovernment Actuary&apos;s Department(321176) Dd. 130671   28 ,  201 Bk Pfs  12/68  St.S.
