OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 11925th October, 1968COPY NO.CABINETCOMMISSION ON THE CONSTITUTION64Memorandum by the Secretary of State  or the Home department on 24th October the Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet(CC(68) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 1) the progress that had been madein considering devolution to Scotland and Wales since the report of the ministerial Committee on Devolution was considered by the parliamentary committee and I was invited to circulate proposals for the appointment ofa Commission on the Constitution.     These proposals are in essence thoseof the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales and myself, but I havenot had the opportunity of consulting them on the modifications arisingfrom the meeting of the Group of Ministers on 23rd October,Arguments for a Commission on the Constitution2,       The proposals arising from the Ministerial Committee onDevolution were:-(i)  That further thought should be given to arranging for the scottish and Welsh Grand Committees and Select Committees reportingto them to sit in Edinburgh and Cardiff.(ii)   That further measures of administrative devolution to the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales should be considered.We believe that these proposals represent the most that can becontemplated in the short term;  but that in present circumstancesthey are, taken by themselves, too little and too late.    The intensity of current discussion of the problem of bringing government closer tothe people and in particular of the possibility of forms of self-government for Scotland and Wales demonstrates an urgent need to recognise the problem as meriting high priority in urgency and importance.    It is not only a question of preventing the case for thepresent system going by default.    Although administration in scotland has been the subject of previous enquiries and devolution to Scotland andWales has been frequently canvassed (a brief note of the background is at annex A), the problem is one which has never been authoritatively considered as respects the United Kingdom as a whole.    Most of the current proposals,and certainly the most extreme, are the product of emotion rather than anydeep and dispassionate study of the financial, economic and administrativefacts of the situation.    We believe that a long-term study of the situationcannot now be delayed till later in the life of the present Parliament,    Ifthere is a need for a thorough review of the system of central government as it affects the different parts of the United Kingdom, so also recent-1-
CONFIDENTIAL n ^ AZ IIdevelopments point to the need to reconsider the relationships between theUnited Kingdom and the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.    In particular the implications of accession by the United Kingdom to the european economic Community raise difficult constitutional and economic questions.Our proposal, therefore, is that a Commission on the Constitution shouldbe set up at once with a view to considering what changes are needed inthe system of central government as it affects the different parts of theUnited Kingdom, and in our constitutional relationships with the channel islands and the Isle of Man.    If this is agreed I hope that our intentionv/ould be announced in The Queenls Speech,The Local Government Commissions3,      Nothing should be allowed to impede the Government1 s considerationof the reports of the Maud and Wheatley Commissions, which are expectedearly next year;  or to prevent the application to Wales, if it is thought desirable, of recommendations that are accepted for England and scotland,    While one may question whether ideally one should settle the pattern of local government before that of central government, weshould regard, and indeed represent, a Commission on the constitution as a natural development from the local government commissions.Depending on the outcome of Maud and Wheatley, the developmentof a new tier of government at regional level within the countries of the United Kingdom might prove to be an important element inthe Commission&apos;s remit.The,Type of Commission4.       The unique scope and importance of a commission on the lines proposed would have to be reflected in its composition.    There is someattraction in a Round Table Conference, composed of Ministers and senior members of the Government and Opposition Parties.     Such aconference was held under the chairmanship of the then Lord chancellor in relation to the Malta Constitution in 1955,    While we do not excludesuch a conference at a later stage, we think that it v/ould not be a suitablebody to undertake the searching constitutional, economic and socialenquiries that must precede final decisions,    We therefore envisagea commission (which should as a matter of form be a Royal Commissionbut which v/ould be called the Commission on the Constitution) consistingof the following elements:   senior members of both Houses, one or twoexperienced &quot;proconsuls&quot;, economists, constitutional lawyers andadministrators (including those with experience in local government);to these we should probably add representatives of the Confederation ofBritish Industry and Trades Union Congress;  and there might be greatmerit in securing as a member a statesman from a commonwealth country.5,      It would not be difficult to arramge that England, Scotland andWales, and Northern Ireland were represented over all the classesmentioned above (and not in each class).    But it seems to us important that there should be on the commission in their own right people ofdistinction in Scottish and Welsh affairs - and no doubt Northern Irish -who, while not professed nationalists, are known to have an open.mindon the main questions at issue and who are seen to be independent of westminster,     The problems of the various parts of the United kingdom are not the same and the solutions may not necessarily be the same.    Itwould be very difficult to secure representation of the Channel Islands andthe Isle of Man,
Terms of Reference of a Commission on the Constitution6P      I now propose terms of reference on the following lines:-&quot;To examine the present functions of the central legislature and government in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and such modifications as maypresently be made in those functions;  to consider what changes,in the interests of prosperity and good government, are desirable in those functions, in the form of the constitution, or otherwisein present constitutional and economic relationships;  and toconsider whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships between the United Kingdom and theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man&quot;,7.       This form of words would make it clear that it would be open toParliament and the Government to make changes while the commission is sitting - a point which it would be important to emphasise in the debate on the Address.    The possibility of a written constitution is intended to be covered by the words &quot;in the form of the constitution&quot;, and it is made clear that the economic (and therefore the financial) relationships as v/ellas the constitutional relationships between the parts of the United kingdom are to be covered.Northern Ireland8,      So far I have assumed that Northern Ireland - and the channel islands and the Isle of Man - would be included in the scope of theCommission, but it is necessary to consider the implications of theintent to include them.    So far as Northern Ireland is concerned, wemust naturally expect strong pressure from our back-benchers tc includeit.    But the appointment of a Commission must not be taken as relievingus, or the Northern Ireland Government, from dealing with the immediate situation there.     My own view is that the best hope of immediate progresslies in persuading - and, most important, being seen to persuade -Captain 0&apos;Neill to an acceptable immediate course of action in the transferred field through action at Storrnont.    We should press foran acceleration of local government electoral reforms to bring thesystem closer to that in Great Britain and for reforms in the systemof housing allocation by local authorities.    Such action as this wouldin no way be prejudiced by the inclusion of Northern Ireland within thescope of the Commission.    But clearly, if there is to be a Commissionon the Constitution, Northern Ireland must be included.    Such questipnsas the continuance of the fabric of the Government of Ireland Act 1920would fall to the Commission to consider; and it would also have totake account of the entrenched provision in the Ireland Act 1949, where&quot;It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of HisMajesty&apos;s Dominions and of the United Kingdom and it is herebyaffirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereofcease to be part of His Majesty1 s Dominions and of the United kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland&quot;.
Consultation with Northern Ireland and the Islands9.       The proposed terms of reference sever the problems of theUnited Kingdom from those of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,which are not part of it.     Northern Ireland, would be included as beingpart of the United Kingdom,,     The Northern Ireland Government wouldbe likely to show little enthusiasm for inclusion, but for them to decline to be included -would clearly be extremely difficult for them to defend.Our constitutional relationships with Northern Ireland require that theyshould be consulted and my hope would be that they could be brought toagree,10,       The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would also need to be consulted under the constitutional relationships we have v/ith them.What is desirable is that, following the announcement of an intentionto set up a wide-ranging commission, we should give the Islands anopportunity to make their views on inclusion known to us.    It cannotbe taken for granted that there will be a ready acceptance of theproposals in all the Islands and it will be necessary to emphasise that the Commission-will be concerned with their relationships v/with the United Kingdom Parliament and Government, but not with the institutions under which and the manner in which domestic home rule is in future to be conducted.The queen s Speech11,        The requirements of consultation dictate the kind of referencethat can be made in The Queenrs Speech,    If it is accepted that theremust be consultation following the general announcement of intent toset up a Commission, it follows that the passage in The Queen&apos;sSpeech could not simply consist of an abridged version of the terms -of reference0    I therefore propose a passage on the following lines:-&quot;My Government will initiate consultations on the appointmentof a Commission on the Constitution which would consider what changesmay be needed in the central institutions of government in relation to theseveral countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and examinerelationships with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man&quot;.The Debate on the Address120      I attach at Annex B a suggested outline of a passage that mightbe used for opening the Debate on the Address,Li, J, C,Home Office, S.,W.l.25th October, 1968-4-
CONHDENTBALAnnex ADEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALESBACKGROUNDCommittees1,     There appear to have been no Government appointedcommittees dealing with government generally in Wales in contrast to a relatively large number for Scotland:    theGilmour Committee in 1937, the Catto Committee in 1952 and a royal Commission in 1954*     The Catto Committee was concernedwith the economic relationship between Scotland and the restof the United Kingdom.      The Royal Commission was appointed toexamine the arrangements for exercising the functions ofgovernment in Scotland with reference to the financial,economics administrative and other considerations involved.It made a number of recommendations primarily on administrative matters:   but put forward no radical proposals.It rejected a home rule Parliament on the Northern Irelandmodel.Private Members&apos; Bills2.     There have been a number of Private Members&apos; Billsdesigned to secure home rules Parliaments for both Scotlandand Wales separately (I know of no Bill that covered both countries).     The last Bill for Scotland was introduced in1966 and had Mrs Grimond&apos;s support.     It was blocked.     for wales the last Bill was that of Lord Ogmore in 1967.     PorWales there have also been proposals for various forms of elected Council.5thei2^Pi2ca2 osaJLs3.     There have also been a number of pamphlets and articlesnotably a series in Scotsman early this year, a pamphlet byMr. David Steel M.P. and Professor H. J. Paton&apos;s book.     TheScotsman articles favour a federal system for the UnitedKingdom with four constituent parts, autonomous in most mattersexcept defence and foreign affairs, with, a joint board tosettle vital economic matters.     In May 1968 the Leader of theOpposition proposed a constitutional committee to consider thegovernment of Scotland and in particular the setting up of a scottish Assembly that would &apos;take part in legislation inconjunction with Parliament&apos;.     He has since set up acommittee of his own to work on this.     At the General Assemblythis year the Church of Scotland passed a 1 Deliverance&apos;  calling for the appointment of a Royal Commission on Self Governmentfor Scotland.     The reply set out the arrangements fordischarging Government business in Scotland.5a r.ent Work on Economic Statisticsh*     The Treasury and the Scottish Office are at present working on the possibility of producing a more up to datestatistical account of the economic relationship between Englandand Scotland than the Return produced in pursuance of the CattoReport.
confidential annex BOutline of PassaAe for use inOpeninA the Debate on the Address1,    Constitutional relationships never previously considered asa whole.    Limited scope (and authority) of Mr. Heath1s Commission&quot;(Scotland Only),   No use tackling the task country by country. 2.     Devolution not a new topic, but current discussion intense.On the one hand it may not be generally appreciated what degreeof devolution now exists and how it has developed.   On the otherhand the Government recognise that Government must not onlyoe efficient - this is no time to dissipate our strength in europe and the world:-   it must also be fully democratic in the sense that people must feel they have influence over decisions thataffect them.3.     Efficiency not always easily reconciled with participation1,&quot;Participation&apos; not always easily reconciled with economic prosperity and social well being.   Dispassionate inquiry needed to balance factors.    Emotion must give place to fact.   Pullopportunity for all to make views known, and to be examined in public.    Terms of reference will allow widest scope,U.    Advantages of including Northern Ireland, but constitutionalrelationships require consultation.    That is now proceeding.Importance of Commission&apos;s not prejudicing immediate steps inrelation to Northern Ireland, which are to be discussed withCaptain 0&apos;Neill.   Assurance that it will not.5c     Relationships with Channel Islands and Isle of Man needreview.   New concepts such as that involved in membership ofwider communities, notably E.E.C., pose new problems not easilysoluble within present framework.   Some thought already given,but need to consider within wider whole.    Consultations needed and are proceeding&apos;.6.     Commission will not involve a standstill in pace of advance.Will not hold up action on Maud and dheatley.    will not holdup other changes affecting Scotland and dales that Governmenthas already been considering.   Terms of reference will be draftedso as not to prejudice action meanwhile and Commission will beenjoined to take changes into account.CONFIDENTIAL
