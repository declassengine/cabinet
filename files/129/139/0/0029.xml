The views of officials are summarised in the accompanyingnote which, in the absence of the Chairman of the Ministerial Committeeon Environmental Planning, I am circulating for consideration by theCabinet.

DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)i op.I ] 1 tjiDgcember, 1 968COPY NO.&quot;T!KBiNE-T-CENTRAL LANCASHIRE, NEW TOWNNote by the Chairman of the Official.jCon^ltteeon Environmental Planning1,    At their meeting on 1hth March 1968 the Committee (EP(68)third meeting, item 5) instructed the Official Committee to considerthe report by consultants evaluating the effect on North east lancashire of the proposed new town in central Lancashire; and toput forward recommendations for action in the light of the viev/s ofthe Regional Council and the local authorities concerned.2,    The new town proposal was first announced by the Governmentin February 1965*    It is for the development in the Preston/Leyland/Chorley area, which at present has a population of some250 , 0 00 , of a large new city which would grow, by immigration of150,0 00 and natural increase, to a population of about 500,000 bythe end of the century.    This development would not only help tomeet the long-term needs of overspill and population increase of theNorth West as a whole; as a large and concentrated development itwould offer the opportunity to create a centre of economic growth,and so accelerate the industrial revival of Lancashire.   Forthese reasons the proposal is strongly supported by the North WestEconomic Planning Council and the County Council.    Consultantshave reported that the site is well suited in capacity and locationfor these purposes; and have proposed an area that should be designated as the site of the new town.3.    The proposal has, however, aroused apprehensions in neighbouringNorth East Lancashire - the areas of Blackburn, Burnley andKosscndale.    This is a typical &apos;grey area&apos; of the kind whose problemsarc now being studied by the Hunt Committee.    Consultants have madeG separate study evaluating the likely effects of the new town onNorth East Lancashire.    This suggested the project would have bothadvantages and disadvantages for North Bast Lancashire, but these were likely to become evident only after about 1980.    This allowstime for North East Lancashire to improve its comparative position.1    .CONFIDENTIAL
The North East Lancashire authorities do not oppose the newtown proposal as such, hut ask for safeguards.    Some of these arein fields on which decisions must await the report of the HuntCommittee.   Their other concerns relate to communications, theproblem of urban renewal, and the need for a plan for the future ofthe area, on which some progress can he made now,5,    The new town proposal in relation to both Central and Northgast Lancashire is dealt with in detail in the Ministry of housing and Local Government paper annexed.   But there are four main aspectsflhich the Official Committee has considered.The Impact of the New Town6,    The consultants&apos;  Judgement that the new town would have little effect on North East Lancashire in the first decade can he accepted.Their assessment that in the longer term the new town would have an increasingly complex effect which would include increased travel towork in the new town, a stimulus to the growth centres of industryand increased difficulties for declining ones, with overall anaccelerated rate of change, seems broadly right.    The consultants didnot consider that the new town would attract industries which other-wise would have moved to North East Lancashire.    In the longer term the people in the area must benefit from the access to wider jobopportunities and city scale facilities which improved communications and the growth of the new town would give them.    None of this suggestssuch adverse effects on North East Lancashire that the new town pro-posal ought to he abandoned or substantially modified. .7.    On the other hand there are powerful reasons for proceeding with the new town.    The problems of overspill from the conurbations .and long term population growth in the region must he met.    Thetown will help to limit both outward migration f rom the region andfurther congestion in the Manchester/Liverpool belt; and as a newcentre of growth it should make a major contribution to promotingindustrial revival,Supply of industry the movement of population to the new town would have toaatch an increase in the number of jobs.    Over the whole period ofthe now town&apos;s development - which would not get under &quot;jray beforeabout 1972 - this will require the movement to the new town of substantial manufacturing employment.   For this the new town willdraw primarily on the South East Lancashire conurbation as the popu-Mtion exporting area, and on the region generally.    Lancashire as  whole has shown a capacity to generate employment for its population, as shown by the extent to which the consequences of the
decline of the textile and mining industries have &quot;been absorbed.Moreover, the new tov/n is well placed, with excellent road and raillinks, and can offer a markedly attractive location for industry.It also has a strong existing industrial base.    The official committee considered that these factors gave sufficient assurance about industrial prospects at this stage to proceed with theproposal.Public expenditure ,    The appendix to the annexed note gives a projection of the totalof both public and private capital investment likely to be requiredfor the new town up to 1981.    To a considerable degree this re-presents the concentration in this area of investment which wouldin any case be required to accommodate the population.    TheCommittee have also considered the more immediate effects on public expenditure within the period of the current public expenditure survey.   Even taking an optimistic view of progress, the new town?;ould still be only in the preliminary stages of development duringthis period.    The major part of such public investment as may berequired would be on housing, which forms part of, and is contained within, the national housing programme.    Investmentunder other heads would be negligible or nil for 1969/70 and barelysignificant in 1970/71, with some increase thereafter.    But inany event, the Ministry of Housing and. Local Government will soorder their priorities as to contain the calls on their investment programmes during the period of the current public expenditure surveywithin whatever limits may be established in the Public expenditure committee.    While the position of Treasury Ministers has been formallyreserved, the Official Committee do not consider in the light of this assurance that the new town proposal should be deferred for public expenditure reasons.I.Lming of the /mnquiicejierit10.   The new town proposal has been the subject of much study and widespread consultation since it was first announced by theGovernment in early 1965.    All the local authorities in the areanow recognise the need for early decisions to end uncertainty.    Thereis no significant outright opposition among them to the new town pro-posal as such.    The North East Lancashire authorities are,  of course,concerned about their industrial future and the measures theGovernment may take for &apos;grey areas&apos; in the light of the report ofthe Hunt Committee; but they do not argue that the making of a draftdesignation order should be held up for this reason.   A draftdesignation order,which would bring matters to the stage where, a specific proposal can be the subject of objection and public enquiry,would lead to a final decision in the latter part of 1969.    The3 . - -CONFIDENTIAL
report of the Hunt Committee will &quot;be available well before then.The Official Committee accordingly consider, that it would now be right to proceed to a draft designation order as soon as possible.Bficommendat i ons11,   The Official Committee endorse the proposal that the Government,aS a major development of their regional strategy for the NorthWest, should announce decisions:(i)    to proceed with the Central Lancashire New Town proposal,and to make a draft designation order;(ii)    to accept the case for an improved road link betweenthe Calder Valley and the M. 6;(iii)    to commission the preparation of pilot schemes of areaimprovement in North East Lancashire;(iv)    to invite the Lancashire County Council, the BlackburnCounty Borough Council and the Burnley County borough council to prepare a sub-regional plan for North east lancashire, which will make the best advantage of thenew road, reserve sites for industry, and generally assessand make provision for the future potential of the areas,(Signed)    R. N. HEATONCabinet Office,LONDON, S.W.1.11th December, 1968k
ANNEXCENTRAL AND NORTH EAST LANCASHIREMote by the Ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentI,  The Cabinet at its meeting on 5th February 1965, (C.C. (65) 7th Meeting,Item 5)j approved in principle the proposal for a new town in Central Lancashire.Consultants were subsequently appointed to advise on the area to be designatedlor the new town and to prepare a draft master plan.   Their report on the firstart cf their commission &quot;Central Lancashire - Study for a City&quot; (the &quot;Designationsport1&apos;) was published in May 1967.   They recommended the designation of some11,500 acres in Central Lancashire, including the whole of the County Borough ofIreston as well as the Leyland/Chorley area, for development under the New(towns Act.&apos;i,   Following the publication of this report, the Ministerial Committee onjMronmental Planning approved a proposal for a further study, to assess theeffect of the new town on North East Lancashire (E.P.(67) 5th Meeting Item 2).She consultants&apos; report &apos; Central Lancashire New Town Proposal - Impact on NorthI7,st Lancashire&quot; (the &quot;Impact Study&quot;) has now been published.   A summary was circulated with E.P. (68)9.).   At their meeting on l4th March 1968 the Committee (E.P.(68)3rd MeetingItem 5) instructed the Official Committee on Environmental Planning to considertiie Impact Study and to put forward recommendations for action in the light of the Study and of the views of the Regional Council and other authorities to be consulted.^consultants&apos; reports^   The purpose of the proposed new town v/as stated in the consultants&apos; remitas being to provide for the long-term overspill needs of the congested areas ofthe North West and particularly of the Manchester conurbation;    and to contribute10 the industrial revival of the whole region.   The designation report envisagedt!le accommodation over 20 years of an incoming population of 150,000 to form,&apos; &quot; 1.   &apos;
with the existing population and natural growth, a city of some 500,000 by theend of the century.   The consultants said that their proposed designated areasatisfied all the locational requirements for a major growth area;    goodcommunications;   firm level sites for industry;   a sizeable town - Preston -suitable for the further development of city functions;    and a certain proportionof modern industry and its associated skills,   In their view the opportunityin this area to create a new city with high standards of environment andaccessibility should, with the potential for economic growth, combine toproduce a new image for the North West, powerful and attractive enough to redress the present regional imbalance of population and prosperity.5.    In the Impact Study the consultants broadly conclude that the developmentof the town will not significantly affect North East Lancashire until after about 198l:   that it will then have increasingly a complex effect, which will include;   an increased travel to work in the new town;    a stimulus toactivities in the growth sectors of industry;    increased difficulties for thedeclining centres;   and overall an accelerated rate of change.    They suggestthat for North East Lancashire to secure the maximum benefit from the newtown there should be:-(a) a good new road connection from the M.6 up the Calder Valley;(b) a special effort to improve and renew the urban fabric;(c) the reservation of areas suitable for industrial development;(d) a substantial expansion of industrial training facilities.They say that the primary need of North East Lancashire is assistance withcommunications and the task of rehabilitation and renewal rather thanindustrial incentives.Views of the North West Economic Planning Council6.    In &quot;Strategy II - The North West of the 1970s&quot; (paras. 85 and 86) theCouncil recommended that the new town should ge ahead as soon as possible.Ifrey considered that the new town would substantially reduce the scale of theconurbation problems posed by population expansion, and could provide theNorth West with a major new growth point in an area whose potential had hitherto been largely neglected.    It would help to counteract the decline in thetraditionalindustries of the surrounding areas, and its new industries should encourage more firms to move both into the new town and into the surrounding.2.
areas, thus increasing the prosperity of the whole of the Fylde and North,North East and Central Lancashire.7,    The Council have re-affirmed these views in the light of the ImpactStudy.   They urge that a designation order should be made as soon as possibleto avoid further uncertainty and to establish a firm basis for future planning in the Central/North East Lancashire area.   They emphasize that the problemsof the older developed areas of North East Lancashire should not be over-looked(the Council had previously proposed a long-term study of the area).    A similarview concerning the new town was expressed to the Prime Minister when he net the  Council earlier this year, and the Prime Minister then said that theGovernment agreed in principle with the need to proceed with the proposals.Views of the County Council8.    The Lancashire County Council strongly support the new town proposals andurge an early designation0 order to correspond broadly with the area recommendedby the consultants.   They consider that the designation of a substantiallysmaller area would fail to secure a build-up leading to self-sustaining growth,would fail to promote the high standard of design and environment required inthe region, and would not allow the creation of a sufficiently large industrialcomplex to support the requisite variety of enterprise.   They say that the impact Study tends to confirm their view that the new town will have no damagingeffects on North East Lancashire, but will act as a stimulus for growth and activity in the area.Views of local authorities within the proposed designation area9.    Preston County Borough Council also support the new town proposals (butreserve their position on satisfactory financial arrangements with theDevelopment Corporation).10.   The designation proposals are generally.acceptable to the second tierauthorities south of Preston.    However, the district councils affected by thePart of the proposed designated area which extends north east of Prestonbeyond the M.6 (the &quot;Longridge   spur&quot;) object to this aspect.Views of the local authorities outside the proposed designation area11&apos;   Joint and unanimous representations have been made by a Conference of north East Lancashire Authorities, which includes all of the first and second3-
tier authorities in North East Lancashire except for the County Council andthe Withnell and Barrowford Urban District Councils.12,  The Conference say that they will be compelled to object to the new towndesignation order if there are not sufficient safeguards for North east lancashire.    They say in general:-(a) that they should not be asked to make a final decision on the newtown until the Government&apos;s intentions on industrial incentives (i.e.following the report of the Hunt Committee) are known;(b) the &quot;Longridge spur&quot; should be omitted from the designated area,pending determination of the right form of development for North east lancashire.13,   The Conference ask for the following specific and general safeguards:-(a) The proposed new road up the Calder Valley should extend to aconnection eastwards to M.1 and A.1;(b) There should be pilot operations in area improvement in North east lancashire;(c) North East Lancashire should have the 85% Development Area rate of grant for clearing derelict land instead of the normal ^QP/oi(d) North East Lancashire should have equal priority with development areas in allocation of urban renewal grants;(e) The Minister should accept in principle that there should be provision for growth of population and industry in North East Lancashireto the full extent of the area&apos;s potential ;(f) The Minister should reject the conclusion in the Impact Study thatthe area&apos;s primary needs are better communications and help withenvironmental improvement rather than industrial incentives.    North east lancashire can accommodate major industrial growth, and a strengthenedand diversified economy is crucial to the future of the area;(g) Any tendency of the new town to reduce job opportunities in professional and administrative fields should be reversed by the decentralisation of central government offices to the area and by the siting of; appropriateregional or sub-regional services throughout the area, including theThird Polytechnic for Lancashire.
lk,   Wigan County Borough have expressed concern about the new town on anumber of occasions.   Their main fear has been that development in CentralLancashire would be at the expense of the renewal and development of SouthLancashire, and Wigan in particular.   They now say that they will not objectto the new town if they can be assured that the new town will not be atthe expense of development which would otherwise havo taken place in SouthLancashire and will not be regarded as setting the future pattern ofdevelopment in that area.    Wigan also claim that any special measures takento assist the North East Lancashire authorities should automatically be madeavailable to South Lancashire, and to Wigan in particular.Appreciation15.   It is now necessary to view together Central and North East Lancashire,in the light of regional needs, and to determine what action will best help to meet the needs of the area and to advance the Government&apos;s regional policies.l6.   Central Lancashire has been a relatively stable area in recent years.It contains some substantial representatives of growth industries in Prestonand Leyland.    It is well placed on national and regional communications andpresents good sites for development.17.   North East Lancashire has a population of nearly 500,000.    It has suffered from the decline of cotton and coal, on which it was heavily dependent.The population has declined, with substantial emigration.    Its urban fabricis largely worn out.    It is an obvious &apos;grey&apos; area.    It is not however inirreversible decline.   Blackburn in particular, by vigorous effort, has achieved a position of relative stability.    Several substantial schemes of town centrerenewal are under way.   Housebuilding has reached a post-war peak.    schemes in the current road programme will substantially improve the southwardcommunications.18.   The calculations in the North West Economic Planning Council&apos;s &quot;Strategy II5&apos;are, basically, an up-dating of figures published in 1965 in the North WestStudy.   They suggest that the Manchester sub-region will have a deficiency of up to 23,000 house sites in 198l, even assuming that 15,000 families have moved to a new town in Central Lancashire.   A more recent calculation by theMinistry of Housing and Local Government, after discussion with the local5.
planning authorities, suggests that the conurbation must export up to kk,000families by 1981 &quot;to Central Lancashire or elsewhere.   This figures assumes that 22,000 families will by then have been housed in other overspill   schemesoutside the conurbation.   In fact a number of these schemes are certain to fall short of their targets and the figure of 4^,000 will therefore be exceeded.19,   The Merseyside conurbation has yet larger overspill requirements forwhich provision has not yet been made:    &quot;Strategy 11&quot;, on a similar basis tothe Manchester Calculation quoted in the preceding paragraph, suggests a deficiency of up to ^2,000 house sites by 198l, even allowing for the new townsat Runcorn and Skelmersdale.    It is right to take these needs into account and to envisage that the Central Lancashire New Town should make some contribution to meeting the needs of North Merseyside.20.   Looking beyond 198l, in the twenty years to 2001, the population of the region - already the most densely populated of the economic planning regions -is expected to grow by some 1.5 million;    provision must be made to accommodatemuch of this growth outside the conurbations.21.   The question is whether the new town is the best way of making provisionfor the needs referred to in the three preceding paragraphs.22.   Distribution of the immigrant population in and throughout Central and north East Lancashire - even if that were practicable - would not maximisethe effect on the area&apos;s economy and prosperity.    The impact (and effort)would be too dispersed.   Concentration as far as possible on a single suitablelocation will channel population growth In this part of the country in a waymost likely to raise to a higher level the facilities available to the populatiito generate an expanding industrial base, and to produce the best possiblemodern enviornment.   The most suitable location for such a development isin Central Lancashire.23.   No development of this kind will secure a rapid and dramatic benefit toneighbouring areas, and the consultants&apos; judgment that the new town would have little effect on North East Lancashire in the first decade can be accepted.The longer-term effects on North East Lancashire are less easy to foretell,hut the consultants&apos; assessment (paragraph 5 above), though possibly tendingtoward optimism, may well be broadly right.   On the narrowest view people in .
CONFIDENTIAL -        353North East Lancashire must in the longer term benefit from having the access torider job opportunities and to city-scale facilities which improved road com-aunications in the area and the growth of such a new town would give them5 but infact the attractiveness of North East Lancashire as a location for modern industry could hardly fail to be, at least to some degree, improved by the proximity andexample of successful large scale expansion.24,  The New Town proposal, first announced in 19^5j is one for the location inthe northern part of the country of a substantial investment.   There is no com-parable proposal capable of early implementation in current regional strategies forthe north.   To abandon this project would be to accept that outward migrationfrom the area and from the region should continue, to make inevitable yet furthercongestion of the Manchester/Liverpool belt, and to forego the opportunity tocreate a new area of growth of benefit to the region as a whole.Action proposed in North Bast Lancashire in the light of the Impact Studyasd of local authority views25.  The Ministry of Transport accept the case for an improved road link betweenthe Calder Valley and the M.6., and that this will be strenghtened by the expectedroad traffic in the area arising from the effect of the new town.    The sort of road required, its effect on the area&apos;s road system and the phasing of its con-struction with the development of the new town are all matters which must be carefully worked out and the Ministry have commissioned the Lancashire CountyCouncil to carry out a feasibility study.   The Council have set up a steering group at official level comprising their own representatives, representatives ofthe Ministries of Transport and Housing and Local Government and highway and planning representatives of each of the county boroughs and district councils inthe Valley and is drawing the New Town consultants into the group&apos;s deliberations.26.   North East Lancashire, like other older industrial areas, needs a determined effort to improve houses which will inevitably remain in use for a number of years,^d their immediate environment.   The G-overnment&apos; s proposals for promoting this were set out in &quot;Old Houses into New Homes&quot; (Cmnd. 3602).   In the circumstancesof North East Lancashire there would be advantage in the commissioning bythe Government, in consultation with the local authorities, of the preparation ofMe or two pilot schemes in .a form which could provide lessons of general application, lead quickly to action on the ground, and serve as pace makers forthe general effort which will be needed by all local authorities in North east lancashire.   In this way an improvement of living conditions in North EastCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL -       354Lancashire can be promoted in parallel with the improvements which the newtown will bring to Central Lancashire.27.   The need for expansion of industrial training or retraining facilities in the area, would be kept under continuous review by the Department ofEmployment and Productivity and the Industrial Training Boards.28.   A sub-regional physical plan for North East Lancashire is now needed, tosecure the best advantage from improved communication, to set aside land for industrial development, and to set the lines for such measure of growth asthe area may support.   This plan will be able to take into account whateverdecisions follow the report of the Hunt Committee.    It would be appropriate for it to be prepared by the three local planning authorities (Lancashire,Blackburn, Burnley) in consultation with the Regional Economic Planning Counciland Board but some leadership by the Government may be necessary if progress is to be made.29.   There are accordingly a number of positive actions which can be taken nowin relation to North East Lancashire, which follow the lines suggested by the consultants, form part of a single strategy with the establishment of the newtown, provide solid evidence of the Government&apos;s concern for the area, and meet in a numher of important respects the views of the local authorities in the area.30.   The measures proposed do not meet all the demands of the North East Lancashireauthorities for action in North East Lancashire to safeguard their position if the new town goes ahead.   The authorities place first on their list a proposalfor the construction of a new road eastward to link the area with the M.l.   TheMinistry of Transport consider that there is at present no evidence to justifythis, and that the completion of the M.62 in the early 1970s, and other plannedimprovements to existing roads, will cater adequately for the cross-Penninetraffic movement; second, the local authorities propose that the area should incertain respects (rate of grant for restoring the derelict land, priorities in urban renewal grants) be treated as a development area;    and they emphasise theneed in their view for industrial incentives.   But it would not be right to singleout North East Lancashire for special treatment now on matters such as these which*e Hunt Committee are still considering.I^Hgtry, Employment and TimingWithin the North West, Central Lancashire presents an attractive location^or industry.   It is well placed on national communications, the main line8.
CONFIDENTIAL -       355railway and the M.6? and, being at the latter&apos;s junction with the M.61 (Preston-iianchester) vrtiich connects with the M.62 (Lancashire-Yorkshire) it is on regionalcommunications which will be much improved in the 1970s; suitable large, levelsites can be made availablej several large national firms are established in thearea; it lies close to areas of great natural beauty.   The development here of astrong and expanding industrial complex must be of major long term benefit tothe whole region.32,  It is reasonable to suppose that the North West Region as a whole - the mostdensely populated region with a population of some six million - would, in times of economic prosperity, generate enough new projects to meet the CentralLancashire requirement.   Lancashire has shown a remarkable capacity to generateeaployment for its population and to absorb the consequences of the decline ofthe textile and mining industries.   But it is difficult to assess with precisionthe prospects of securing a sufficient build-up of employment to match the plannedpopulation growth.   In addition to expansion of firms within the new town, CentralLancashire will have to look for its industry primarily to the population-exporting areas and especially to the Manchester conurbation.   But the conurbationnay not have a large enough share of fast-growing manufacturing industries togive assurance that it will be a sufficient source of new projects.    Some gapmay remain to be filled.33.  The prospects of attracting sufficient industry are dependent both on the performance of the national economy, and on the pattern of inducements for, andcontrol of, industrial development throughout the country.   Looked at in the lightof today, with limited growth of industry and consequently relatively limitedsupplies of mobile industry, and in advance of decisions following the report bf theHunt Committee, it cannot be asserted that no shortfall in supply of industry would remain to be filled from elsewhere than Manchester.   But looking to the long termof years over which the project is envisaged, it is right to say that the site pre-sents the characteristics and advantages which are necessary to its success.34.   The North East Lancashire authorities urge that no further decision should betaken on the new town until the Government can announce their conclusions, fol-lcwing the report of the Hunt Committee.    (This means at best the spring orsummer of 1969).   The concern of these authorities is that they should see what isto be done for them as &quot;grey areas&quot; before the new town proposal goes forward,there will in any case be strong pressure for Central and North East Lancashire tobe treated equally in deciding the application of any new policies on the basis ofthe Hunt report.   Meanwhile, as the Impact Study indicates, the new town could haveno major effect on North East Lancashire for a number of years.
jjt   A decision now to proceed with the new town proposal would be given effect by a draft designation order under the New Towns Act.   This would be open to objection and to public local inquiry.   If an objection were maintained bya local planning authority, the final designation order would be subject to the negative resolution procedure in Parliament.    The final stage in the statutorydesignation procedure would, in consequence, not be reached until fairly late in 1969, by which time the Government should have received and considered theHunt report.36.   There are strong arguments for proceeding now to a decision to publish a draft designation order:(a) the need for the new town arises from population pressures for which provision must be made.    If it is deferred, there will be further search for short-term and second-best solutions, such as further unacceptablespread of the conurbations, to the prejudice of this strategic proposal;(b) there are substantial Ministerial commitments in principle to theproposal, which was first announced in February 1965, which has been widely welcomed as an unprecedented proposal for an important concentration of public and private investment in the region, and in the North generally;(c) the new town proposal is a cardinal feature in the plans of the NorthWest Region Economic Planning Council, and was emphasised as such in theirreport &quot;Strategy IT&quot; to which the Government will soon need to reply;(d) for these reasons there is strong pressure from the County Council, the regional Council, the local authorities in the new town area, and from muchopinion in Lancashire,  for an early decision to proceed.37.   In the light of these considerations it is recommended that the right course is to proceed now to a draft designation order, accepting that when the time comes for policy decisions arising from the Hunt report the industrial needsof the new town will to some extent at least have to be taken into account.Ijhgjjesignated Area38.   The designated area proposed by the consultants is too large, since itis based partly on an assumption of lower densities of development thanshould reasonably be achieved.    A number of reductions are proposed, which are described in appendix 1.   They reduce the area from seme 51,080 acres to about10.
m 000 acresj and still allow the flexibility necessary to achieve the purposesof the town.   It would not, however, be right to go further and delete entirelyihe &quot;Longridge spur&quot;.   This truncation of the area would make it impossible to achieve the scale of growth proposed.   It would also remove the fineopportunity which the terrain in this part of the site presents for building to a high standard -of amenity and environment in a way that will be an example to the region.   The development of this part of the site will not materiallyaffect the overall interaction between the new town and North East Lancashire,for its direct links will be urban ones into Preston.39, The calls made by the new town on public expenditure within the period ofthe current Public Expenditure Survey are not large, and the Ministry of housing will order their priorities to contain the calls on their programmeswithin whatever limits may be established in the Public Expenditure Committee.The main expenditure would fall later than the period covered by the currentPublic Expenditure Survey.   In the report of the New Towns Working Group(SP0(67)23) broad estimates were made of the total capital investment (public and private sectors) expressed as a call on national resources, for the new towns programme as a whole.   The programme included provision for new town development at Ashford, which has since been abandoned, and at Stansted - whichas a commitment can be abandoned.   These estimates included provision for theCentral Lancashire New Town.   The estimates for this town should now be amended to take account of the delay in starting, and also to take account, in the late19701 s, of a build-up to a higher rate of development in the 1980&apos;s.   The previousand amended figures are in appendix 2.Recommendations40.  As a major development of their regional strategy for the North West,the Government should announce decisionst,(i)   to proceed with the Central Lancashire New Town proposal, and tomake a draft designation order,(ii)   to accept the case for an improved road link between the CalderValley and the M.65(iii)   to commission the preparation of pilot schemes of area improvement in north East Lancashire;(iv)   to invite the Lancashire County Council, the Blackburn CountyBorough Council and the Burnley County Borough Council to prepare asub-regional plan for North East Lancashire which will make the best advantage of the new road, reserve sites for industry, and generallyassess and make provision for the future potential of the areas.Ministry of Housing and Local Governmenti&amp;Ukcember 196811.
Appendix 1The Proposed Designated area on Plan A attached t* the area originally proposed by the consultants forviolation is shown edged with a black line.   It covers some 51,^60 acres.   Therea now proposed for designation (about ^1,700 acres) is edged in blue, and thesreages of the various areas whose exclusion is proposed are also shown.    (In twolaces, a slight extension is proposed, to give more logical boundaries).   Thereposed cuts do not affect the structure of the new town area, and consist mainlyfrelatively minor boundary adjustments.   The two most significant are(a) The exclusion of 2810 acres south-west of Chorley, including the village of Coppull.   This may not be welcomed locally;    it will be argued thatCoppull will come under strong development pressures, best channelledand controlled by the New Town Corporation.    But this can also be saidof other villages just outside the proposed designation area, particularlyAdlington (which has asked to be included).    The exclusion of theCoppull area has the advantage of taking the new town boundary furtherfrom Wigan, and the justification for including it in the designatedarea is slight.(b) The exclusion of 1699 acres of valley plain and escarpment along thesouth bank of the river Ribble.   The consultants recommended its inclusion in the designated area to ensure that it was preserved forrecreational and amenity purposes.   But designation is not essential forthis purpose.   The river forms a traditional boundary at this point, andthe exclusion of this area is likely to be welcomed locally.A summary of the proposed reductions is given below:-jsed Reductions Acreswth of Preston 698&quot;th East of Preston (k areas near Longridge and Whittingham) 125^ Net0rth East of Preston (Areas south of River Ribble and near Ribchester) 1985&quot;&apos;&quot; East of Chorley 89^Quth West of Chorley (including Coppull) 2810utfi West of Leyland 6kl;5t of Preston (2 areas) 14?9 Net9761 AcresAmbers of the Committee only.
