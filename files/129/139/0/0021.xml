EARNINGS RELATED PENSION SCHEMENote by a Group of Egonomie AdvisersAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 20th October 1968(CC(68)h3 Conclusions, Item 5) the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited to arrange for the Economic Advisers to consider thedesirability of building up a large surplus during the early years of the scheme and the economic implications of doing soby raising employers&apos; contributions.    We have held, one meeting to discuss this subject and some provisional comments are setout below.Tfaejtnaffnitude of--the- increase jji-: contributions&apos;&apos; andof the additional Fund created1The scheme put forward &quot;by-the Lord President envisagesemployees&apos; contributions of 6:f per cent of earnings (up to a ceiling of one and a half times average male industrial earnings),and employers&apos; contributions of 6^ per cent with no ceiling on earnings.    Calculations made by the Government Actuary have shownthat, on the assumptions in the Lord President1s paper,contributions at these levels, together with benefits as proposed,would result in the addition of  2,250 million to the existing national Insurance Fund over the first 11 years of the new scheme:;thereafter the Fund would decline unless contributions were increased.    (These calculations assume a constant price level).1 -The calculations In this paper assume, purely for purposesof illustration, that employers&apos; contributions are increased by1 per cent (from 6-g- per cent to fi per cent).    On this assumption,and assuming no change in the benefits proposed in the lord president&apos;s paper,  the Fund would be built up by approximately 12,000 million over a period of 2k years before it began to decline.     If the increase ?;ere larger or smaller than 1 per centall the estimated effects would be correspondingly changed.*On the same assumptions stated above, the increase inemployers&apos; contributions, compared with the level in the proposed scheme, v/ould be approximately  225 million in the first year -1972/3 - rising to  320 million by 1982/3.     Compared with the reseirfc scheme the total increase in employers&apos; contributions in1972773 would be approximately  370 million and that in insuredpersons&apos; contributions approximately  210 million.Effects on pricesT the balance of payments andthe distribution off IneomfePrices.     The assumed increase in employers&apos; contributions,compared with the scheme proposed by the Lord President, would raise labour costs throughout the economy by about 1 per cent.The general price level would also be raised by approximately this/amount:$   For example, if employers&apos; contributions were increased by per cent, the Fund would be built up by  5,600 million over aperiod of 17 years.
amount:    the direct effect on prices would, he somewhat lessbecause the import content of output would he unaffected;    but the rise in the cost of living would increase pressure for higher wages which in turn would lead to higher prices.*The increase in employer1s contributions, by raising prices,would reduce demand.    Assuming that it were desired to maintainthe level of output and employment, it would be necessary fortaxes to be lower, or public expenditure higher, than it otherwise would have been, by roughly the same amount (about  225 million) ,although the exact size of the offsetting measures required would depend on their nature.Ba^lance of payments^     The increased employers&apos; contributions would&quot;be similar to a general payroll tax and it would not bepossible to remit them on exports (or to levy them on imports).Very few other taxes raise export costs directly in this way.    Thenet effect of increasing employers&apos; contributions, and reducingother taxes or increasing public expenditure so as to maintain thesame level of activity, would almost certainly worsen the balanceof payments - by anything up to  80 million in 1972/3-    This figure would gradually increase in subsequent years. (In addition, thescheme proposed by the Lord President was estimated in our earliernote to worsen the balance of payments by up to  hO million in1972/30P^JL^^k^^^^/-4R^om.e.*    The ne-t effect on the distribution of income would depend on the nature of the offsetting measures takento maintain employment and activity.    The increase in employers&apos;contributions would tend to raise prices across the board, andwould in itself have rather little effect on the distribution of income.    If the increase was offset by, for example, a reductionin income tax or surtax the net effect would be regressive.    If,on the other hand,  it was offset by, for example, a reduction inbeer or tobacco taxes the net effect would be progressive.monetary &quot;qity^ on if the Fund were invested in Government securities, any neteffect on the Governments borrowing requirement and the monetarysituation would be relatively small;    for increased revenue fromhigher contributions would be broadly offset by the reduction intaxes or the increase in public expenditure required to maintainthe level of activity./If the Fund,If the increase in contributions -re raised in partly additional contributions from employees, the^^ease in pr Qnler directlysmaller, because employees&apos; co^r1^1^?^ ininto costs.

But the extent to which the Government could in practiceincrease investment to offset the increase in employers1contributions is likely to he limited.    For the Increase inemployers&apos; contributions would raise prices and so restrainconsumption (without increasing the expectation of higherpensions)^    and there is likely to be pressure for offsettingredactions in taxation which would relax the restraint on consumption, in preference to measures which increased invest-raehti   In that case the amassing of a large Fund during theearly years of the new scheme would not reduce the burden of thehigher pensions on the working population in later years, as there would be no more resources available in the economy.Sharing.....the benefits ,jof.jhe j;rotdh of jpriyate profit-sOne possible attraction of investment in equities would bethe growing income accruing to the Government without the odiumof taxation.   However, any benefit would be slow to materialise,because the current dividend yield on equities (about 3i per centon average) is substantially below that on gilt-edged (about7f per cent);    and, as has been seen above, the interest rate on government debt might be increased in relation to the yield onequities.    Corporation Tax already gives the Government a share in the growth of private profits;    and a relatively small increasein Corporation Tax would give the same result as would be achieved by creating this Fund and investing it in equities.I is pal .st xppt egyAn increase in employers&apos; contributions with no charge in national insurance benefits would be a deliberate part of theGovernment&apos;s fiscal strategy.    Thus the Government would have toconsider whether, if its objective were an increase in public expenditure or a reduction in certain forms of taxation, this method of raising revenue was the most suitable,.    looked at outsidethe context of the earnings-related pension scheme, higheremployers&apos; contributions have the attraction of being a widespreadtax levied across the board vvhich could raise large sums for asmall nominal rate;    but they have a much more adverse effect onthe balance of payments then most other taxes.wnciusions.To sum up, our main conclusions are as follows:-(a) /in increase in employers1 contributions would be equivalentto a tax on industry and would have a significant effect on prices and on the balance of payments.(b) The creation of a bigger Fund would not by itself help tomake available more resources in the future to pay forbenefits.(c) It is unlikely to bo possible to use the fund to increaseinvestment (and thus the resources available in the future)to more than a, limited extent.(d) Investment of the Fund in equities would have little effecton real resources and some undesirable monetaryconsequences.    The Government could more easily obtain ahigher stake in the growth of profits in industry by raising Corporation Tax.
