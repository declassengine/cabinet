17SECRET .. . ..     1&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)J 9(68110^ COPY NO.   0s)cabinet it is desirable for the Cabinet, before approving The Queen!sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament, to look again at the legislative programme for 1968-69 and to confirm, with amendments arising fi omdevelopments during the summer, the provisional programme approved in June (CC(68) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4).2.     The Annex to this paper sets out the programme, as approved.Since then it has become necessary to add some Bills to that programme,the need for which was not foreseen in June.    I propose that New Towns(FJnajnceJ should be added to List Al.    The Bill will raise the limits of advances to Development Corporations and the Commission and is needed if the development of the new towns is not to be interrupted.Similar financial considerations may make Shy^j^ldinj^Lt^(Amjsjidment), which would raise the limit for guarantees issued inrespect of home ship orders, essential; it should be put in List A2.Loca^jjoverjorn^nt^ct ^ Amendjmejat), is necessary to enable the urban programme for areas of special need to be lau&amp;ched;  I suggest that itshould be added to List B.   It is also agreed that there should belegislation to permit the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation to borrowin foreign currencies but I propose that this be included in the miscellaneous Financial Provisions Bill.3.     I was invited by the Cabinet in June to arrange for the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure to consider in due courserecommendations of the Select Committee on Procedure about the lengthand number of recesses, and the proposals made in the cabinet&apos;s dis-icussionfor saving Parliamentary time.    The Select Committee have now reported and this Ministerial Committee will shortly be consideringtheir recommendations, and the proposals made by the Cabinet in discussion.    However, there does not seem to be any prospect, arisingfrom the Select Committeers recommendations, of additional time being available for legislation; in particular, the proposed changes in the dates of the Session would not affect the overall length of the Session.Nor do I think it wise, for reasons I can develop if desired, to reckonon obtaining any additional legislative time by other means, e. g. curtailingthe debate on the Address gives no new time, and time gained on theDefence Estimates accrues to the Opposition.
4.     On the basis that it will not be possible to find any extra legislativetime in 1968-69, I do not think there is any scope for further additions tothe programme.     We are already pressing hard on availableParliamentary time and drafting resources to complete a heavy pro-grammes   especially after adding the Bills mentioned in paragraph 2; andwe agreed in June to leave ourselves time in the second half of the session in case we decided to introduce a Bill on Industrial Relations.    We left open, pending further consideration of the policy by the Home AffairsCommittee, the question whether we should include a Bill to limitexpenditure on Cljgaret^Adjv^Ji^in^.    Even if these are not put in,however, there are Bills which the Cabinet has already agreed shouldfill the gap: A^r ^of^orjaUons and Indust^u^Dey(Atomic Energy Authority Act (Amendment) is now unlikely to be neededthis Session but its loss will be more than balanced by the additional Billsmentioned in paragraph 2, )5.     Above all, we must not hamper our freedom of manoeuvre in the1969-70 Session by committing ourselves to more than we can manage in1968-69.    I am at present in touch with Ministers about their preliminaryproposals for 1969-70 and, while the results of my enquiries are not yetcomplete, it is clear that once again there will be very considerable pressure in that Session on Parliamentary time and drafting resources.6.     I ask the Cabinet to confirm their approval of the provisionallegislative programme for 1968-69 with the addition of Nej^Towns-^ ll^EB^B^BHSH^l&apos; an-d to authorise me to keep the programme underreview in the light of developments during the Session.T.F.
