1$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government(68) 110 COPY NO.CABINETFREQUENCY OF REVIEWS UNDER THE EARNINGS-^LAXEp-^NSjraN]sC^EMEMejnorandurn ^y^th^J^hThe Treasury were asked by the Social Services Committee toprepare a paper on the cost and implications of annual, as opposed tobiennial, pension reviews.2.      The main considerations affecting the choice fall under threeheadings:(a) The financial cost, direct and indirect, in terms of higherpayments by the public sector.(b) The impact on the economy.(c) The administrative problems.cost.     The direct cost would depend on the degree of post-awarddynamism given under the new scheme.    On the assumption of anaverage increase in money earnings of 6 per cent a year associatedwith an increase of 3 per cent a year in prices, the extra cost of annual, rather than biennial, upratings would amount to about 5 per cent of the total outlay under the scheme every second year with earnings-dynamism and Z\ per cent with price-dynamism.   At 1968 prices thiswould average out under full earnings-dynamism to about  150 millionevery other year after 5 years and about  55 0 million after 30 years.With price-dynamism the extra cost would be about  70 million every other year after 5 years, rising to about  250 million after 30 years.4.     Moreover, commitment to annual upratings in the White paper in 1968 would lead to pressure for this promised feature of the new arrangements to be adopted for the remaining years of the present scheme, with consequent additional cost of the order of  150 million a year in the off-years between upratings in the near future,5.     If there are annual upratings for national insurance benefits,there must inevitably be the same for supplementary benefits.    Becauseof the inter-action between the supplementary benefit rates and the rising level of pensions as the scheme moves to maturity, it is difficultto estimate the extra cost of annual upratings of supplementary benefitswith any degree of precision.    At the beginning of the new scheme itseems likely to be about  20 million every other year.-1-
6.     Whatever is decided in the national insurance field will have repercussions on Government expenditure in other fields.     TheGovernment could hardly treat its own pensioners much worse than it istreating the mass of the population under the national insurancescheme.    The present cost of public service and armed forces pensionsis about  316 million a year; assuming that they are increased only in line with prices, the amount at stake at present is, with prices increasingat 3 per cent a year, about  10 million every second year.    To the extent that the cost of public service pensions increases apart from the effectof post-award dynamism (as it is bound to do, e. g. because the NHSscheme is not yet fully mature), and to the extent that increases morenearly in line with those in the national insurance field come to be conceded, the amount could be much greater, although the &quot;modifica-tions&quot; in the public sector schemes to take account of the new national insurance scheme would be an offsetting factor,7,      There would be a similar impact in the field of armed servicespay, which is at present reviewed every two years.    The extra costof annual reviews - which would have to be enough to keep armed forces pay in line with earnings elsewhere - would be  15-20 million everysecond year (assuming, as with national insurance, that moneyearnings increase by 6 per cent a year).    Civil Service pay as suchwould not be directly affected; the Pay Research Unit could not carryout its surveys for each of the main classes more frequently than everythird year, and the precedent has already been set of having central pay increases in the meanwhile.     But there can be no doubt that thepractice of annual reviews elsewhere in the public sector would makeit much more difficult to withhold any part of central pay settlementsuntil a later date, as was done recently.8,     In incomes policy terms any arrangement providing forautomatic annual increases based on changes in the cost of living or in earnings elsewhere is in conflict with a policy which denies automaticincreases in pay on similar grounds.    Annual reviews would for thisreason by more awkward than biennial.    At the same time they would tend to accelerate the pace of wage settlements.    While the relation-ship between amount and frequency of increases, and the value of along interval between wage settlements should not be overstated, it isgenerally true that the more frequent the adjustment the larger thetotal of increases.    Moreover, a settlement lasting for more than ayear gives employers some assurance about the level of future costs and makes a contribution in a movement towards greater stability of contracts.    In the longer run the entrenched privilege of annual reviews in the Government field could seriously prejudice theacceptance by employers of longer contracts and so deny UnitedKingdom industry the benefits in terms of stable costs and betterplanning of future production such contracts might bring.Administrative savings9.     The frequency of reviews also has an important effect on administrative costs.    Each review is a major exercise which requiresextensive overtime working and costs in all about  1 million.
10.     Moreover upratings in the autumn (the period of the year so farpreferred for social reasons and as more convenient for the Ministry of social Security) are much more difficult for Inland Revenue to cope withand inconvenience those pensioners who come within the PAYE systembecause of their other income (at present about l\ million).    Withannual upratings in the autumn their coding would never be right; witha biennial system it would be right every other year.    The unpopularityof such an arrangement coupled with the difficulties for Inland Revenueif upratings were to be made annually would force reconsideration ofthe case for doing them in the spring.Summary;11,     The extra cost of annual, as compared with biennial, reviewswould be very substantial within the new scheme itself.    There wouldalso be quite significant additional costs in terms of public sector pay and pensions.    All these extra commitments would limit our room for manoeuvre in the management of the economy.    It is important toretain as much flexibility as possible in the new scheme, especially atthe outset.    If later it were found possible to accommodate them, wecould always move towards annual revies, whereas to go back to abiennial pattern once annual upratings were established would be virtually impossible.R, H.
