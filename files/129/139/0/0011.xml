IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(68) HI COPY NO,   5)015th October, 1968CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet decided on 18th July (CC(68) 36th Conclusions,Minute 5 (Confidential Annex)) that, so far as could then be judged, thebest course open to the Government on House of Lords reform -was to seek to implement the proposals in the draft White Paper and that work should go forward on the preparation of the necessary Bill,    The position was to be reviewed in the autumn.    Our commitment to early legislationhad been reaffirmed in the Prime Minister^ statement in the House ofCommons on 20th June.2.      The Ministerial Committee on the House of Lords has carefully considered the various alternatives which are now open to us, and wehave agreed that the best course would still be to proceed with theexisting proposals.    We recommend that the Government should, announce in the debate on the Address our intention to proceed with a reform onthis basis, and make clear our intention to go ahead even if theOpposition do not agree;  but that we should also give the opposition leaders an opportunity to see and comment on a draft White Paper and adraft Bill,    The draft White Paper would contain the same proposals asthose on which the Inter-Party Conference had been working, but it wouldbe in the form of a Unilateral11 document for presentation by theGovernment alone.    The White Paper has been revised for this purpose and the new draft is attached as Annex B, while Annex A summarises the main changes from the draft circulated with C(68) 87;  a draft Billtogether with an explanatory memorandum are attached as Annex C.If the Opposition suggest that there should be further inter-Party talkswe could accept the suggestion but only on the basis that those mattersof policy which had already been exhaustively explored and agreed by theInter-Party Conference would not be re-opened, and that agreement onthe text of a White Paper and of a Bill must be reached quickly.3.      A solution imposed in this way would be more welcome to our ownbackbenchers than a formal invitation to resume talks, and if theOpposition were to decide to co-operate, we should achieve the principaladvantages of an agreed scheme; we would secure an easier passagefor the Bill and for our legislative programme generally and at the sametime make it more difficult for any future Conservative government tomake unilateral changes in the agreed scheme in ways unacceptable to us.-1-
Agreement would have the further advantage of committing theOpposition to those parts of the scheme which must depend not on statutebut on constitutional convention, e.g. the voting strength of the parties in the reformed House.    On the other hand, if the Opposition decided notto co-operate, we should have the advantage that our own backbencherswould give us added support for the very reason that we should be in conflict widi the Conservatives.    As for public reaction, an offer to show the Opposition the draft White Paper and consult them on the draft Billshould meet the likely demand that we should make an effort to reach aformally agreed solution.4,      This course should not present serious difficulty if, as there isnow reason to hopes the Conservatives in the Lords co-operate on theTransport Bill and the order to continue the Southern Rhodesia Act, 1965,It might still be the best courseif they do not;  but in that event feelingamongst our own supporters might make it desirable for us to modify the scheme, for example by removing at once the existing peers bysuccession, instead of allowing them to fade out gradually as speakingpeers.    Much would however depend on the climate of Party and publicopinion at the time and we do not think it would be sensible to reach any final conclusions at this stage.5.      I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that we should proceed as proposed in paragraph 2 above.G.House of Lords, S.W.1.15th October, 1968
ANNEX Adraft circulated with c(68j871 i     The language has been revised to make the White Paper more suitablefor unilateral presentation, less emphasis being placed on the advantages of the House of Lords.     Some changes of order have also been made toimprove the argument;   in particular the material on previous attempts at reform is now in Appendix I.2.     The main changes of substance are as follows:-(i)   the introductory paragraphs have been revised to give lessprominence to the Inter-Party Conference ana to include a clear statement of the Government&apos;s objectives;(ii)   paragraph 8 gives a fuller treatment of the functions ofthe House of Lords;(iii)   in paragraphs 9 to 14 the statistical material on the composition of the House has been revised and expanded;(iv)   paragraph 29 deals with the problem of patronage in greater detail than the previous draft.3.    The following have been omitted from the new draft as not appropriate to a unilateral document:-(i)   the suggestion that peers who have disclaimed their titles(iii)(ii)might be enabled to recover them (paragraph 66 of theprevious draft);the suggestion that the Inter-Party Conference might remainin being to keep the working of the reforms under review(previously paragraph 68);the discussion of the date of commencement (paragraphs 71 to74 of the previous draft)&apos;.

HOUSE OF LORDS REFORMI,   The Background to the ReformIt was announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of parliament on 30th October that legislation would be introdueed to reform the composition and powers of the House of Lords *2,   A Conference of representatives of the three main parties was conveneda year ago j on the initiative of the Government, in the hope that anall-party consensus could be reached about the place, powers and composition of the second chamber in the present day.   Its discussions were based onthe proposition that the powers of the House of Lords should be reduced andits present hereditary basis eliminated, and that it should thereby be enabled to develop within the framework of a modem parliamentary system.   TheConference met first in November 19&amp;7 and continued its discussions untilJune 19685, when they were suspended following the Lords&apos; rejection by 193votes to 184 of the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) Order 1968.3.   The Inter-Party Conference had by that time reached agreement on themain outlines of a comprehensive scheme for reform, covering both the powersand the composition of the House of Lords, and sssch constructive work hadbeen dons on the details of its implementation.   The Government hasoontinued and completed the work from the point at which the talks came to an end, and proposes shortly to introduce the legislation necessaryto bring the scheme into effect.4.   The Government believes that any reform should achieve the following: objectives;(a)  The hereditary basis for membership should be eliminated 1No one party should possess a permanent majority;vc)  In normal circumstances the government of the day should be able to secure a reasonable workingmajority;
(d) The powers of the House of Lords to delay legislation shouldbe restricted;   and(e) Its absolute power to withhold consent to subordinate legislationagainst the will of the Commons should be abolished.5,     The Government also considers that any reform should be based on thefollowing propositions:(a) in the framework of a modern parliamentary system the second chamberhas an essential role to play, complementary to but not rivalling thatof the Commons;(b) its present composition and powers prevent the House of Lords fromperforming that role as effectively as it should;(c) the reform should therefore be directed towards promoting the more efficient working of Parliament as a whole;   and(d) once the reform has been completed the work of the two Houses should become more closely co-ordinated and integrated, and the functions ofthe House of Lords should be reviewed.6,     The scheme which the Government proposes meets all these objectives and satisfies all these requirements..   Its main features are a two-tier House with 1 voting1 members who would be entitled to speakand vote, and 1 speaking&apos;members who would be entitled to speak but not generally to vote.   Membership would for the future be by nomination alone andsuccession to a hereditary peerage would no longer carry the right to a seatin the House;   but existing members who sit by right of succession would lose their voting rights but would be able to remain as speaking members for the remainder of their lives.   Some of the more politically active peersby succession would be granted life peerages and so become entitled to membership of the voting nucleus.   The government of the day would be entitled to secure for itself an adequate working majority over the opposition parties, although nota maGority of the House as a whole when members who accept no party allegianceare induded.   The present powers of the House to delay public bills would bereduced to   a power to impose a period of delay of six months from the dateQ  disagreement between the two Houses;   and its power to reject subordinate
legislation would be replaced &quot;by a power sufficient only to require theHouse of Coifflaons to consider it again.   There would remain a place in the reformed House for law lords and bishops, but the number of bishops wouldbo gradually reduced from 26 to 16.  The reform would not affeot thejudicial functions of the House or the rights of the peerage as an order,since these questions are outside the scope of a reform which is concernedwith the position of the House of Lords as the second chamber of Parliament.7.   The following paragraphs of this part of the paper give an accountof the presssat functions of the House of Lords and of its composition and powers;  set out the reasons why a comprehensive reform of its composition and powers is now required;   and describe a number of schemes which have been considered and rejected.   Finally an explanation is given of the reasons for which the Government adopted the scheme nowproposed. Part II of the paper gives the proposals in detail.Appendix I gives an account of some of the previous attempts at reform and Appendix II offers some ideas for developments in  functions and procedure.Funotioas of the House of Lords8.   Apart from providing the supreme court of appeal, the House of Lordsat present performs the following main functions:(a) the provision of a forum for full and free debate on matters of public interest;(b) the revision of public bills brought from the Houseof Commons;(a)   the initiation of public legislation, including inparticular those government bills which are notcontroversial in party political terms and private members * bills;(d) the consideration of delegated legislation;(e) the scrutiny of the activities of the Executive;   and(f) the scrutiny of private legislation.... 1 these functions must be performed by Parliament, whether by the
House of Lords or by the House of Commons, and in all of them except the Last theHouse of Lords has in recent years made an increasing contribution and thevolume of its work has expanded.   Over the years it has evolved from achamber -shich provided a cheek on the executive by its power to challengelegislation to one which can still act as a check on the executive but does so through the detailed consideration of legislation and its scrutiny of administrative decisions.    &quot;The House is however prevented fromdeveloping its full effectiveness by the problems of composition and powers $hieh have bedevilled all discussions of the funotions of theHouse of Lords in recent years.   Once these problems of composition and powers have been solved the functions of the House of Lords should also be reviewed and developed,   but such a review could not be profitably made until that time and it would in any event be more appropriately undertaken by the two Houses themselves.   In making its present proposals, the G-overn-ment has assumed that the functions of the House will remain broadly those set out above, but it has borne in mind that they might be extended and developed later.    The Government sees this possibility of developing thefunctions of Parliament as a whole as the most positive ground   for reform *The present House of Lords - Composition9o   In May 196*8 the House consisted of:(a) 742 hereditary peers by succession(b) 122 hereditary peers of first creation(0)        143 life peers^(d) 23 serving or retired law lords^(e) 26&quot; bishops^Total  1,056In this paper, peers who sit by right of succession to a hereditary titlewe described as peers by succession?   all other members of the House9&quot;&quot;&quot;hat is categories (b) - (e) above? are described as nominated peers.(1)   Created under the Life Peerages Act 1958(2)   Peers qualified to sit judicially under the Appellate JuridictionAct 1876(3)  Consisting of the two archbishops, the Bishops of London, durham and Winchester, and 21 diocesan bishops of the established churehin England.   Bishops are not, strictly speaking, peers but arelords spiritual and lords of Parliament.   They leave the House on retirement. eEMET
jO.    The membership of the House of Lords has increased steadily since1900, when it was 590, because frequent new creations have been made and because until the introduction of life peerages in 1958 all newly createdmembers of the House, except Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and bishops, werehereditary peers.    The increase in the total size of the House has been accompanied by an increase in the number of its totallj&apos; inactive members.11,    Of its present potential membership of over 1000, between 350 and 400did not attend the House at all during the session for 1967-68 up tol6t August:   most of these were either on leave of absence or had not receiveda writ of summons.    Of the 678 peers who did attend, rather less than 300attended reasonably often - 33s per cent or more of the sittings of theHouse or of its committees;   rather more than 200 attended from time to time -between 5 per cent and 333&apos; Per cent of the sittings;   and 175 attended veryrarely indeed - 5 per cent or less of the sittings.     Of the 320 or sonominated peers about 250 attended the House, and of these about 150 attendedreasonably often, about 65 attended from time to time and about 50 attendedvery rarely indeed.    The average daily attendance for 1967-68 up to 1st August was about 230:   this figure compares with 140 in 1963 and 92in 1955*    These figures are shown in the table on page 7..12,    The table also shows that there is a striking difference between theparty political composition of the whole House on the one hand and of thosepeers who attend regularly on the other.     On 1st August 1968 a total of about350 peers took the Conservative whip, about 115 took the Labour whip and about 40 took the Liberal whip.    The remainder, including those who didnot attend, took no party whip.    On the other hand, of those who attendedmore than 33j per cent of the sittings during the session for 1967-68 up to 1st August, about 125 took the Conservative whip, about 95 took the Labour whip,about 20 took the Liberal whip and about 50 took no party whip0    Amongstnominated peers the figures for the whole House were 94 Labour,
77 Conservative, 13 Liberal and 1^0 viithout a party whip, giving a totalof ;2^;   for those who attended 33-5 per cent of the sittings the figures were 81 labour, 38 Conservative, eight Liberal and 26 without a party whip,giving a total of 153*1),    The frequency with which peers of each&apos;party attend the House is alsoillustrated by the chart on page 8.   The information is again based onfigures for the session 1967-68 up to 1st August.14, Since those peers who attend regularly but take no party whip usuallysit on the cross benches, they are commonly known as &apos;cross benchers4 6They are a special feature of the House of Lords and include men and womenwith a wide range of backgrounds who for one reason or another prefer notto accept any party allegiances   The evidence shows that in speech and vote they do not adhere regularly to any party,,  Many have full-time occupations outside the House and for thisreason they tend to come infrequently until they retire from their regularoccupation;   but after retirement many give a period of regular service tothe House0   Some of the most influential speeches by cross benchers havebeen made by those who come rarely.   The evidence indicates that they do notIpossess any sense of corporate identity or act in any way as an organisedIgroup, and they resist any tendency for them to be regarded as suoh*pl^gjjsjc^JIouse of Lords - PowersI&quot;. The House of Lords has the same right to initiate and to delay or&apos;revise legislation as the House of Commons (subject to the Commons&apos;financial privilege), except for the restrictions imposed by the Parliamentlots of 1911 and 1$li$a   These are described in detail in Appendix Ij   their effect in practice is that a bill to whioh the Lords are opposed can neverpe passed in lass than 13 months from the original seoond reading of theppill in the House of Commons and in some circumstances the period could wellin 8ubstantially longer.   The effective delay which the House of Lords canPause is however muoh shorter than this, since the period of 13 monthsEludes the time needed for the bill to pass through all its stages in the

House of Commons after second reading and also the time which the Houseof Lords takes to consider the bill up to the point of disagreement.Nevertheless, dislocation of the parliamentary timetable can be causedat any time and, if a bill is not introduced until towards the end ofa parliament, it may be lost altogether.     Subordinate legislation,(1)private bills and bills to confirm provisional orders      do not comevathin the limitations of the Parliament Acts.f6.    The result of the increase in the use of subordinate legislation is that the theoretical scope for the Lords to use their powers inorder to override the Commons has in fact grown considerably sincethe passage of the Parliament Act 1911.    Over a wide area, which tends to expand as the processes of legislation and of government become more complex, provisions supplementary to legislation are left to bemade by subordinate legislation, that is by Order in Council ordepartmental order or regulation.     The enactments conferring these powers normally include provision for Parliament to supervise their use, the substance of which is either that an instrument made under thepower may be annulled by resolution of either House or that such an instrument cannot come into force (or remain in force) unless approvedby resolution of each House.    Except in the fields of taxation andother financial matters, these provisions give parallel powers to bothHouses.    The Parliament Acts do not apply, and the House of Commons hasno means of overriding a decision of the House of Lords whioh conflictswith its own.Jj^g^eJ^rreform17.    The present composition of the House of Lords gives it somequalities which are particularly valuable to it in performing the functionsset out in paragraph 8 above.    The detailed consideration of legislation   and including confirmation bills under the Private Legislation ProcedureScotland) Act 1936
the scrutiny of administrative decisions demand the presence of a nucleus of experienced parliamentarians who are able to devote asubstantial part of their time to the business of the House;   but itsfunction as a forum for wide-ranging debate makes desirable inaddition the presence of men and women who have expert knowledge ofor a special interest in the subject under discussion.     nevertheless the House has two main features which are inappropriate to modern conditions:   first, the right to vote oan still be derived fromsuccession to a hereditary peerage and second, the House stillcontains a-permanent majority for one political party.     The unsatis-factory situation which these features have produced is seen mostclearly in the way in whioh the House of Lords has made use of its powers:   although its formal powers are considerable, and haveincreased in scope with the wider use of subordinate legislation, inpractice its final powers of delay over public legislation and ofrejection of subordinate legislation have remained almost whollyunused.    These powers cannot however be disregarded since they^givethe Lords considerable influence, of which they make effective usein amending bills brought to them in the course of the ordinarylegislative process of scrutiny and revision.     Governments are naturally more ready to accept amendments on matters which do not involve major party political controversy,
and the Lords&apos; influence has therefore most frequently affected private members&apos; bills and those government bills which have been less controversialin party political terms;   but the Lords have nevertheless made their influence felt on party political issues, by governments both of the right and of the lefts18,  Since the permanent majority has been for the Conservatives, however,the Lords&apos; influence, and the threat of the use of their final powers, have always had a mare important bearing on the major legislative proposals of governments of the left - for example, the delays forced upon the labour government on the Iron and Steel Bill 1949 - although for the same reason the threat to a government of the left oannot easily be brought into play withoutthe risk of involving Parliament in a constitutional crisis.   As regardssubordinate legislation, mention has already been made of the Lords&apos;rejection of the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) Order on18th June 1968;   and there have been a few occasions on which orders havenot been proceeded with because of known opposition in the House of Lords *But the fact remains that since 1914 the only bill aotually passed into lawagainst the continuing opposition of the Lords was the Parliament Bill of1947j and on the single occasion since the Second World War when the Lordshave rejected an item of subordinate legislation they did not persist intheir opposition when an equivalent Order was subsequently introduced.   Thereason is clear:   the composition of the House is suoh that the Lords cannotpersist in their opposition to a measure upon which the Commons are determinedwithout the risk of provoking a constitutional crisis.   Nevertheless, thepossibility that the Lords might use their formal powers remains a politicalfact with which every non-Conservative government must reckon, particularlyafter its third year in office and whioh tends to undermine the effectiveness of the popular vote at an election.    A situation in which the House of Lordsis prevented by its composition from making use of its powers oannot be satisfactory or even respectable at the present time, when increasing demandsare being made on Parliament and there is widespread public concern that our
parliamentary institutions should be made more effective.19,   To solve these problems some would favour a remedy which wouldabolish the House of Lords altogether, or alternatively would strip it soradically of its powers and functions that the House of Commons would becomein effect the sole organ of parliamentary government.    To adopt a system of single-chamber government would however be contrary to the practice of every other parliamentary democracy which has to legislate for a large population.More important, the case for two-chamber government in this country has been strengthened since the end of the Second World War by the g rowth in thevolume and complexity of legislation, and also by the increase in the activity and power of the executive and in its use of subordinate legislation.Moreover, in terms of this country&apos;s experience, abolition of the second chamber would subject the House of Commons to severe strain, and paradoxicallywould result in less procedural flexibility and speed because of the need toguard against the overhasty passage of legislation.20,    Another remedy suggested whioh would leave the composition ofthe House unchanged but would reduce its powers.     Such a remedy wouldtransform the upper House into little more than a debating chamber, and atleast some of its functions would have to be performed exclusively by theHouse of Commons.    Again, additional burdens would be imposed upon the commons which would be difficult for them to sustain.    Furthermore, if theHouse had no worthwhile function to perform, distinguished men and women would be reluctant to become members.Possible schemes of reform21.    For these reasons the Government believes that there is no sensiblealternative to a comprehensive reform both of the composition and of thepowers of the House of Lords.     It therefore examined a number of well-knownproposals whioh have been made at various times.     One group relies on thePrinciple that a modern second chamber should derive its authority fromthe popular vote - for example, that the membership should be directly
elected by the electorate which chooses the Commons.    An obvious method ofmaking such a change would be to follow the example of Norway where some ofthe members elected in a general eleotion go to the lower house and theremainder to the upper house.    Alternatively, the upper House could be electedindirectly, or by larger and different constituencies and for longer (orshorter) periods than the House of Commons *22,    There are of course strong arguments for an elected second chamber:it seems both radical and rational since it would both make clear the source of the political authority of the upper House, and it would also successfully prevent the maintenance of a permanent majority for any one party.    Whether or not a House of Lords reformed in this way became a senior and influential chamber, like the Senate of the United States ofAmerica, would largely depend upon the system by which its members were elected and upon the powers it possessed.    But whatever the system of election and whatever its powers, a directly elected second chamber would inevitably become a rival to the House of Commons.    The second chamberwould then also possess a mandate from the people, and it might thereforebe inclined to make a claim for greater or even equal powers, and inparticular to challenge the present control by the Commons of finance and^PPly.    A directly elected second chamber fits well enough into a constitutionbased on a division of powers between two chambers (most often found inconnexion with a federal system of government) but it would violate thecentral principle of the present British parliamentary system by which it hasbeen recognised, at least since the beginning of the nineteenth century, thatthe government stands or falls in the House of Commons,23.    A second possibility would be an upper House constituted on a regionalbasis:   for example, indirectly elected or nominated by local authorities.But a House composed on this principle would still be open to the dangersresulting from the probability of rivalry between the Houses, although possiblynot in such an acute form as if it were directly eleoted.     The Government
certainly thinks it essential to include in the reformed House members from scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and also from the regions of England,but while recognising the current demands for national or regional government it does not think that a response which sought to establish are formed seoond chamber on a purely regional basis would be practicable atthis stage.  There do not at present exist the national or regionalinstitutions which could provide the machinery for selection for such achamber, and it is difficult to see how the selection could be made throughthe existing system of looal government.   Local government elections takeplace at different times from general elections, and a government with amajority in the House of Commons oould well find itself in a minority in theHouse of Lords.  Many believe that a radical reconstruction of local govern-ment is in any event long   overdue  and two Royal Commissions are subjectingthe present system to detailed and comprehensive inquiry.   It is relevantthat in countries where there is an effective upper house based on some form of regional or local representation - for example in Australia or inthe United States of America - it is usually part of a federal system ofgovernment which does not exist in this country.   Finally, a chamberwhich was based on any form of regional representation would inevitably alter the relationships which at present exist between members of parliament and their constituents.2%. Another suggestion was that the reformed House should consist solely of peers nominated for the life of one parliament.   The party membership of theHouse of Lords in each parliament would then be arranged broadly to reflect the balance of parties in the lower House.   The main attraction of thisproposal is that without recourse to elections it would remove the permanentmajority for a single party and would replace it by an assured majority forthe government of the day;   but this attraction is more than outweighed by thereduotion in the independence of the individual peer and of the House as a&quot;hole which the change would inevitably bring with it.  A House composed in
this way would in effect reproduce the composition of the House of commons and re fie ot its opinions and decisions-   it would therefore be incapable ofcarrying out effectively the complementary funotions which the reformed second chamber should perform.    Further, if members of the House of Lords were appointed afresh after eaoh general election, powers of patronage would inevitably be greatly increased since in order to be re-selected a peer wouldhave to remain acceptable to the party managers.    Under the present system a  peer having once become a peer cannot be deprived of his seat in the House,and the Government believes that this feature should be preserved in theInformed House.Principles of reform25.    Two main principles emerge from the examination of these suggestions.iThe first is that if a reformed House is to have the authority which an effective second chamber requires, it must possess a degree of genuine independence.    The present House has three characteristics on which such an^Independence could be founded.    The first is the fact already mentioned thatfonce created a peer cannot be deprived of his seat;   the second is the participation of a considerable number of part-time members with wide interestsand experience who can make contributions of high quality from time to time;iand the third is the presence of a number of cross benchers who owe no allegiance to any party.    It is however prevented from developing their potential by the unsatisfactory features of its composition which have already been described -the hereditary principle and the permanent majority for one political party,fte Government considers that these three characteristics should be preservedto give the reformed House the independence it needs, and that the reformshould seek to remove those unsatisfactory features of the present House whiohPrevent it from taking full advantage of them. p.    The second principle is that the government of the day, of whatever partylit might be, should be able to make the fullest use of those qualities and opportunities whioh the reformed House would offer.     No government couldhowever be expected to do so, or to encourage the development of its functions,Without a reasonable expectation that its measures would normally be passedWithout undue delay.    It is therefore important that the government of theday should have a majority of the party membership of the working House which
would be sufficient for this purpose.   These two principles must inevitablyconflict to some extent and it is essential that any proposals for reformshould attempt to reconcile them so far as possible.A &apos;two-tier&apos; scheme27.  The need to reconcile these two principles led to the suggestion of a&quot;two-tier&apos; scheme which would divide the membership of the reformed Houseinto two groups, &quot;voting&apos; peers and &quot;speaking8 peers.  For the future, all new members of the House would sit by right of nomination and hot by rightof succession to a hereditary peerage.   Voting peers would constitute a&quot;working House&apos; in whom the effeotive power of decision would reside.   Inparticular they would be responsible for the bulk of the work arising fromthe legislative functions of the House,   as indicated above, these dutiesrequire regular attendance and would not be appropriate for those who canattend only occasionally.   Voting peers would include every nominated peerwho was prepared to accept, for the term of a parliament at a time, the res-responsibilities of regular attendance j   in the first instance the number ofnominated peers available to serve in the working House would be increased,to the extent necessary to create a viable House and to achieve politicalbalance, by conferring life peerages on a number of active peers by succession.The government of the day would have a majority of the party membership but,in order to preserve the measure of independence to which the Governmentattaches importance and to avoid the need for large numbers of new peers to be created at every change of government, it would not have a majority of theworking House as a isihole when those without party allegiance were also takeninto account.   It follows that the government&apos;s majority over the other parties would be small, perhaps ten per cent of the total of the opposition parties, and that it would not vary with the size of the government&apos;s majority in the House of Commons.   It might be thought that the peers without partyallegiance - the cross benchers - would thus hold the balance of power andwould come to represent a new constitutional force;   but it was pointed outin Paragraph 14 above   that they have no sense of corporate identity at present
An incoming government would achieve its majority over the other partiesby means of a suitable number of new creations during its first monthsof office:   this practice, combined with a voting freehold, could theoreticallyproduce an indefinite inorease in the size of the voting House, but studieshave indicated that in almost any foreseeable circumstances the voting Houseoould be kept, or soon restored, to an acceptable size if the older membersretired as voting peers at the end of eaoh parliament under a retirementrule (they would remain in the House for life as speaking peers).28,    The * second tier&apos; would be composed of speaking peers who would compriseall the other members of the House of Lords at the time of the reform.     Theexistence of this second tier would make it possible to bring into the Housenominated peers who could not attend regularly but who would be able to makevaluable contributions from time to time:   they would include representativesof the professions, scientists, industrialists, trade union leaders and otherleading members of the community whose presenoe would enable the House toconsider and discuss with authority all aspects of national life, together withthose experienced parliamentarians who were too old to be expected to attendregularly.    In order to preserve continuity and to limit the extent to which any individuals rights were taken from him, this second tier would also include, at first, those existing peers by succession who wished to remain inthe House;   but since they would not be entitled to vote, all connexion betweenthe hereditary principle and the power to vote would be severed immediately.29.    The Government proposes to retain the arrangements by which new members are admitted to the House of Lords and they would therefore continue to beadmitted when created peers by the Crown on the recommendation of the PrimeMinister,    Alternative proposals such as nomination for the duration of a parliament have been rejected on the grounds that they would represent an unacceptable extension of the Prime Minister&apos;s powers of patronage.     Onthe other hand, the Government has felt obliged to reject as impracticablea number of schemes which would replace the system of nominationaltogether;    and various methods have therefore been considered
by which the amount of patronage implicit in the Government&apos; s proposals mightbe limited or controlled.   One suggestion was that the power of nominationshould lie not with the Prime Minister but with some form of constitutional committee;  apart however from the traditional objection that such acommittee would hamper the Prime Minister*s discretion,the members of a committee which possessed such a power of nomination wouldbe placed in an extremely embarrassing situation and would be open topressures and representations of a kind which would make it very difficult for them to do their work effectively.   The Government does however seeattraction in the possibility of a committee which, while holding no powerof nomination in its own hands, would review periodically the composition of the reformed House and report, either to the Prime Minister or to Parliamentitself, on any deficiencies in the balance and range of its membership whichit might have found.   Its chairman would be a person of national standingbut without party political affiliations;   its members would include repres-representatives of the political parties and persons without party politicalaffiliations in roughly equal numbers *   Its reports would enable parliament and the country as a whole to satisfy themselves that the powers of patronagewere not being abused.   The Government believes that with this addition thepresent system of nomination provides the most satisfactory method of selectionwhich oan be devised in present circumstances.30. The Government takes the view that a two-tier chamber, organised andohosen in the way proposed, provides a sensible method of transition froma largely hereditary to a wholly nominated House;   it alsomaintains that blend of the active parliamentarian and the independent expertshich gives the present House its special distinction and special qualifica-tions for performing the functions assigned to it.   It would otherwise beimpossible to reconcile the two principles described in paragraphs 25 and-6 above, or to achieve a second chamber which would at once be strong enough for its legislative functions, and for the other functions which maybe placed upon it in due course, and at the same time have amongst its members a sufficient range of knowledge to enable it to debate with authority
any subject of public importance.y^rj&quot;^ t-the reformed House31.   The Government considers that, in exercising the six main functionslisted in paragraph 8 above, the reformed House must possess a real, iflimited, power of delay whose use should not, as it would with the presentcomposition of the House, risk precipitating a constitutional crisis.   Sincethe government of the day would normally have a working majority, the actualuse of this power would continue to be a rare event;   but on publio legislationgenerally a reformed second chamber should have a power of delay sufficientto cause the Commons and the government of the day to think seriously before proceeding with a proposal against the opposition of the Lords, and toencourage a government to seek agreement on any point of dispute which might arise between the House of Commons and the reformed House.   On the other hand,it would not be right for a nominated House to be able to frustrate thelegislative proposals of a government responsible to an elected Housej   andeven if the House of Lords pressed its objections, it should be possible,provided the government had been warned of the objections and had consideredits proposals again, for the House of Commons to carry them into law withina reasonable period of time.32. With these principles in mind   the Government proposes that if the Lords rejeot a bill it should be possible to present it forRoyal Assent at the end of a period of six months from the point of disagree-ment between the two Houses, provided that a resolution directing that itshould be presented has been debated and passed by the House of CommonsoThe period of delay would be capable of running into the next session or thenext parliament, and there would be no need, as there is under the present procedure, for the disagreed bill to be passed again through all its stages in the second session or parliament.   A straightforward power to impose a delay of six months has the double advantage of applying to the legislation01&quot; a government of any party at any stage of a parliament, and of being more readily comprehensible than the complicated provisions of the Parliament Acts.33.  On subordinate legislation the Lords&apos; present powers are also inappropriateand unsuited to modern conditions.   The G-overnment has considered whether it
might be possible to provide for a period of delay analogous to theperiod proposed for public legislation, but it has concluded that such ascheme would be impracticable in present circumstances because of the needfor some orders to take effect immediately and because the concept ofa period of delay is not part of the general legislative framework withinwhich subordinate legislation is enacted.   The Lords&apos; power of outrightrejection should therefore be replaced by a power only to insist that thegovernment of the day should think again and, if necessary, that theHouse of Commons debate again and vote again upon any instrument to whichthe upper House has taken exception.jh.    The Government hopes that the proposed reform of composition and powers will open the way to further developments in the functions and procedures of the House, and enable it to play an increasingly valuablepart in the work of Parliament as a whole.   In the second part of this paper the proposals for reform are presented in detail as a comprehensive plan.
II - Proposals for ReformComposition35    The reformed House would be a two-tier structure comprising &apos;voting&apos;peers with a right both to speak and vote, and &apos;speaking&apos; peers with a right to speak but not generally to vote.   Membership would in the future be by nominationonly, and succession to a hereditary peerage would no longer confer membership of the House of Lords, but those peers by succession who are now members ofthe House would remain as speaking members (unless they elect to resign) for life.56.   The voting peers would constitute the &quot;working House&apos; and in particular they alone would exercise the vote in the whole House or in committees dealingwith legislative matters.   They would be expected to give a substantial partof their time to the business of the House, and would be subject to certain minimum conditions of attendance and to a specified age of retirement.   Theage of retirement would not however be Introduced in this parliament   for the reasons given in paragraph kZ below.   At first, votingpeers would include all those existing nominated peers willing to acceptthe obligations of voting membership, together with additional life peerscreated as necessary to give the working House an appropriate size and balance between the political parties.   A number of peers by succession would be created life peers since they include some of the most active and experiencedmembers of the present House:   they would therefore receive life peerages inaddition to their hereditary titles and would thus be able to qualify for voting membership.   Succession to a hereditary peerage would however no longer in itself carry the right to exercise a vote.37.   All other members of the House would be speaking peers, who would haveno right to vote in the whole House or in committees for the consideration of legis-lation but would be entitled to all other rights as members of the House.They would comprise those nominated peers who were unable or preferred notI to accept the obligations of full working and voting membership but wouldbe able to make a valuable contribution to discussion  from time to time,
together with those who had passed the age of retirement for votingmembership-  For the time being they would also include those existingpeers by succession who continued as such to be members of the reformed house and did not obtain voting rights through the grant of a life peerage.38.  Peers by succession who preferred not to be members of the reformed house would have the option to withdraw if they wished to do so;   those who did would nevertheless be able to retain their titles.   The option would haveto be exercised within a period of one year,from the date of the reform,future peers by succession would be excluded from the reformed Housealtogether but would similarly be able to retain their titles.139.  There would be special arrangements for law lords and bishops, which are described in paragraphs 55 - 62 below.Baais of membershipIkO.-  The present constitutional practice is that new peers are created bythe Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, who consults other partyHeaders in the ease of nominations from their parties.   After becoming a peer,whether by succession or on creation, a peer.s right to sit in the(1)^House of Lords is derived from the rights given to him by letters patent   &apos;;once he possesses these rights he is entitled to a seat in Parliament and togreceive a new writ of summons for each parliament for the remainder of hisplife-time. The writ may not be withheld unless he is disqualified, for exampleas a minor, a bankrupt or an alien.   These arrangements would in generalIpmain unchanged, exoept that those peers who succeeded to a hereditarypeerage after the reform had come into effect, or were then minors, would nojjonger become entitled to receive writs of summons to sit in the House ofjjorda solely by virtue of such a peerage.I&quot;:.iiiimn.............w Mini mi umarn __ffil)  other than those whose peerage was initially created by summons tom    Parliament.
41. The writ of summons would be the same for all peers who were entitledto sit in the House, whether they were voting peers or speakingpeers.   The distinction between voting and speaking rights wouldderive from legislation specifying the qualifications and requirements for the voting right and the circumstances in which the rightmight be relinquished or lost.   It would provide that all existingnominated peers would be qualified for voting rights whenthe reform took effect and that all future nominated peers wouldbe so qualified on their creation.   Not all nominated peers however wouldwi3h to exercise these rights or to accept the obligations which wouldaccompany them, and it would not be expected that they should do so.   Inorder to provide for a choice, qualified peers would have the option to declare their intention to vote, and only those who made the necessary votingdeclaration for any parliament would be entitled to vote in that parliament.The declaration would have to be made within a specified period of the issueof the writ.if2. A peer would cease to be qualified to exercise the vote at the end ofthe parliament in which he reached a specified age of retirement.It is important that during the early stages of the reform as many aspossible of the more active members of the present House should remainavailable and continue as full working members to give the benefit of their knowledge and experience in what must inevitably be a period of adjustment,and the age of retirement would not therefore be introduced in this parliament.     In the long term, however, it would not be right fora working legislative chamber to contain an indefinite number of members,however distinguished, who were well beyond the normal age of retirement fromactive life:   and if members were to be paid (see paragraph ^9 below) it wouldcertainly not be right for membership to carry with it the right to be paid; for the remainder of a life-time.   It is therefore proposed that a peer who; had reached the age of 72 at the end of this parliament- 8hould be Precluded from voting in any future parliament.he choice of a particular retiring age is necessarily a matter
of difficult   judgement and some peers could be valuable members of theHouse for some years after the proposed age of retirement, but a feature ofthe two-tier scheme is that they would be able to remain as speaking peers,and so continue to play an active and constructive part in the work of theHouse.if    It would be a condition of the right to exercise a vote that a peershould attend not less than one-third of the sittings of the House or its committees in each session (attendance at committees would count for thispurpose as attending the House).   No account would however be taken of periodsduring which a voting peer was absent with the leave of the House on accountof ill-health or parliamentary or government business.   In order to preserve the freedom of the Prime Minister in appointing Ministers of his choice andto ensure that a Minister in the House of Lords would be a voting member ofthat House, Ministers would also be exempted both from the attendance require-(1)ment and from the age restriction.      If a voting peer who was not exempted from the attendance requirement found himself unable to meet it or preferrednot to do so, he would be expected to surrender his voting rights;   if he didnot surrender them and it were found at the end of a session that he had notduring that session attended the necessary number of sittings he would bedeemed to have surrendered them.   A voting peer who had surrendered hisvoting rights or was deemed to have done so would not be able to recover them during the same parliament, but he would be able to do so by making a freshdeclaration of his intention to exercise voting rights at the beginning ofthe next parliament.   There would be no restriction on a nominated peer*right to make such a declaration at the beginning of each parliament (providedthat he had not passed the age of retirement and was not disqualified from sitting) and a nominated peer would  thus enjoy the degree of independence which is essential if the important principle mentionedm paragraph 2k above is to be preserved.(1)   Serving law lords and certain bishops would also be exempt for thereasons given in paragraphs 55-62 below.
ijj-voting House - - -llf    The eventual size of the voting House would depend on the way in which its &quot;unctions developed, but the Government considers that in the first instance% reasonable size would be between 200 and 250 excluding law lords and bishops,i TaiWr number might be found necessary as the work of the House developed&apos;/i   *.Ca1 oInd expanded in the future, and much would also depend on the number of speakingleers who attended debates in the.House or served-on committees, and on the frequency with which they did so.    When the reform first came into effect the voting House would consist principally of those present nominated peers who wereIble to attend regularly - about 150 for the session for 1967-68 - but asIndicated in paragraph  36 above they would be supplemented by additional life peers created, as necessary to give the voting House an appropriate size andfjalance between the political parties.    The Government contemplates that about80 new life peers would be needed for this purpose in the first instance, the-great majority of whom would be drawn from existing peers by succession.    The(Voting House would therefore consist at first of about 230 peers: provided thatspeaking peers were also prepared to attend in reasonable numbers   and where appropriate to serve on committees .  this number should be sufficient for thebusiness of the House, at least for the remainder of this parliament.    It mightveil be increased in subsequent parliaments as the work of the House developedbut, to preserve continuity, the number of new life peers to be created when the-reform first came into effect should be no larger than the work to be performedfend the party balance require.N&apos;    The size of the voting House might also have to vary in the future totekc account of changes of government or in the relative strength of the oppo-If L-sition parties.   A scheme which combines a voting freehold with the right for thegovernment of the day to have a majority of the voting party members mustpcessarily be sensitive to changes of government and to changes in the relative. rength of the political parties generally, since with each change of governmentI nun,ber of new peers would be needed to give the appropriate government majorityjoRd the correct party balance.    In most parliaments the number of new peerspeering the voting House would be roughly matched by the number leaving itliving reached the age of retirement, but a succession of changes of governmentfv &quot;hort intervals could lead to a temporary increase in the size of the votingpuoe until enough peers had retired from it to restore the situation to
equilibria&apos;    Mathematical models have been constructed to test the possible effect on the size of the reformed House of various combinations of circum-stances, both as they might appear in the future and as they have aotuallyappeared during the last 60 years.     Studies based on them have shown that most of the likely combinations of circumstances could be reflected in the composition of the voting House without an unmanageable increase in its size.It was proposed in paragraph 29 above that a committee should be appointed to review periodically the composition of the reformed House:   its size is one aspect which the committee should consider from time to time.Relationship between the parties46,  The government of the day would normally have a majority in the House ofLords of about 10 per cent of the combined strength of the opposition parties.The distribution of seats between the opposition parties would so far as possiblehe determined in relation to their representation in the House of Commons and tothe number of votes cast for them in recent general elections, but it would notbe related exactly to either sinoe neither is an accurate reflection of aparty1 s strength.     Assuming a total voting House of 230, the figures whichwould be appropriate in the present parliament are:   government 105, mainopposition party 80, subsidiary opposition parties 15 and cross benchers 30(these figures again exclude law lords and bishops).    If the total membershipwere more than 25O the party representation would be increased in proportion.The figure for particular parties would naturally be capable of being variedfrom tine to time to reflect changes in their relative strength and to take account of the emergence of any new parties.    This is a second aspect whichthe proposed committee might keep under review.Speaking peersV7.    As indicated in paragraph 37 above, speaking peers would comprise:(a) nominated peers who preferred not to exercise voting rights or were deemed to have surrendered them;(b) nominated peers who had passed the age of retirement for voting rights;and(c) existing members of the House who were peers by succession and hadnot become voting peers through the grant of a life peerage.Qr the reasons given in paragraph 28 above, speaking peers would be an- 26 -
integral and important part of the reformed House.     On the floor of theHouse they would therefore have the same rights as voting peers,*ith the exception of the right to vote, and in particular theyirould therefore be able to ask questions or move motions, including motionsrelating to bills and amendments to them.     They would be able to serve oncommittees, but would not be able to vote in any committee for the consider-ation of legislation.    Voting peers would thus control the legislative work1land have the final power of decision, but there would at the same time belevery opportunity for speaking peers to contribute to debate, both onJthe floor of the House and in committee.iScotiand, Wales and Northern IrelandIm.   The Government attaches the greatest importance to the presence in the reformed House of peers who can speak with authority on the problems andIrishes of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and of the. regions of England,jand it has considered very carefully how their presence might most effectivelyibe secured.     There are strong constitutional arguments, based on the presenceIjjof Scottish peers in the House of Lords ever since 1707, and practical arguments;arising from the existenoe of separate Scottish law, which make it particularly important that the reformed House should include a suitable number of Scottishpeers.    There is at present in the House of Lords a considerable numberjof peers who can speak with authority on the needs of the different partsof the United Kingdom, and the objective must be to ensure that this situation continues in the future.     The Government considers that the most satisfactory method of achieving this objective in present circumstances would be for the Prime Minister of the day, in advising the Queen on thecreation of new peers, to pay special and continuing regard to the need forthe membership of the House of Lords to include a suitable number of persons with knowledge of, and experience in, matters which are of special concern to the various parts and regions of the United Kingdom.    / his requirementwould be made statutory^    The committee which has been proposed to review  the composition of the reformed House should also consider this aspect and it.18 one to which it should pay particularly close attention.
49.    Peers are at present able to claim up to 4? guineas a day inreimbursement of expenses necessarily incurred in attending the House, andthose who live away from London can recover their travelling expensesprovided that they have attended not less than one-third of the sittings(1)of the House in the month for which the claim is made.   &apos;The Government considers that.voting peers should infuture receive some remuneration (subject to tax) which would reflect the responsibilities and duties which they would be expected to undertake;   butthe question should be referred to an independent body suoh as theCommittee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament (the lawrence Committee) which reported in 1964 (Cmnd 2516), or to the prices and Incomes Board.Powers - Public bills50.    The powers of the present House of Lords are described in detail inAppendix I,    For the future, a public bill originating in the House ofCommons on which there was disagreement between the two Houses should be capable of being presented for Royal Assent at the end of a period of sixcalendar months from the date of disagreement provided that a resolutiondirecting that it should be presented had been debated and passed in theHouse of Commons.     For this purpose, disagreement would be defined asa situation where a bill sent up from the Commons was rejected by the Lords,where a motion that it should be read at any stage or passed was rejectedor amended, or where the Lords insisted on an amendment v/hich was not acceptable to the Commons.  The House of Lords would have a period of 60parliamentary daysv J in which to consider a bill;   if its considerationof a bill on which there was subsequent disagreement exceeded this period,the excess would count as part of the six months&apos; period of delay followingdisagreement.     Since it would be theoretically possible for the House ofO) Scottish peers are required to attend only one-third of the sittingsat which Scottish business has been discussed.(2) i.e. days not comprised in a period when both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.
Lords to destroy a disputed bill by postponing any overt disagreement untilthe end of the session, the bill should also be treated as disagreed to ifafter the 60 parliamentary days   the Lords rejected a motion necessary to its progress or, in the last resort, if the Commons resolved that the bill shouldbe so treated.    A suitable period of notioe would have to be given in thelatter case,    A bill would be capable of being presented for Royal Assentat the end of the period of delay, notwithstanding that this ran over aprorogation of Parliament and into a new session ;   similarly, in the caseof a dissolution, any bill which had been passed by the House of commons and to which the Lords had disagreed could be presented for Royal Assentin the new parliament after the six months&apos; period of delay had elapsed fromthe date of disagreement.     Provision would also be made to allow any modificationwhich had been agreed between the two Houses after disagreement and before theend of the period of delay to be incorporated in the bill before it became law.The procedure for this purpose would not provide for the discussion of thebill as a whole to be reopened and the House of Commons would not be obligedto take any action on any proposals for compromise;   but there would be provision for the bill to include such amendments as gave effect to theproposals for modifications agreed to by both Houses since the date of the dis-agreement.    it would be necessary for the bill to be submitted for royal assent within 30 parliamentary days ^ from the end of the period of delayafter disagreement.5&quot;i.    Since there is no question of oonflict between a government andthe Lords on private bills and bills to confirm provisional orders, and since the quasi-judicial procedures oh such bills would makeit inappropriate to apply the Parliament Act procedure to them, it isproposed to make no change in the present powers of the House of lords on private legislation.0) i.e., for this purpose, days not comprised in a period when bothHouses are adjourned for more than four days, or when parliament is prorogued or dissolved.- 29 -
2.    The existing provision in the Parliament Aots which excludes from their application any bill to extend the duration of a parliament would becontinued in relation to the new powers of the   House of Lords.     It would therefore remain impossible for a bill to extend the duration of a parliament to be passed without the lords  consent.Powers - Subordinate legislation53.    The main types of parliamentary control over subordinate legislationare described in paragraph 16 above.    The procedure in respect of sub-ordinate legislation which can be annulled by either House is governed bysection 5 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946, under which a resolutionfor annulment may be passed by either House within 40 parliamentary days from the day on which it is laid before that House.     For these cases theoperation of any resolution for annulment passed by the House of lords should be suspended until the end of the period of 40 parliamentary days,or until the end of a period of 20 parliamentary days from the date on whichthe resolution is passed, whichever is the later;   and a resolution passedby the Lords would be ineffective if thereafter a corresponding resolution is rejected by the Commons or the instrument in question is approved by aresolution of the Commons.    As regards cases in which the affirmativeapproval of both Houses is required, it is proposed that where a motion for such approval is rejected by the Lords the House of Commons should been abled to override the decision of the House of Lords by an expressdirection.    To ensure however that the object of requiring the House ofCommons to consider a proposal a second time is achieved, this power wouldbe Limited to those oases in which the instrument in question had beenconsidered by the Commons and had been approved by them before the motion for approval was rejected by the Lords.5h,     The Government has considered whether the House of Lords oould begiven the right to impose a period of delay in respect of subordinate legislation, especially where it was not urgent, analogous to the proposedright in respeot of public bills.     The concept of a period of delay isnot however part of the present power of the House of Lords in relation to statutory instruments, and a considerable survey would be needed in order to
establish the feasibility, in legislative and administrative terms, of introducing for subordinate legislation any provision for a period of delayas such.    It might be possible for such a survey to ascertain whether any classification of statutory orders into urgent and less urgent couldbe devised.      There is a rudimentary distinction in that some instrumentsoome into operation at once and the parliamentary procedure, whetheraffirmative or negative, is addressed to the question whether they shall continue in operation;   while other orders require a parliamentary procedure, affirmative or negative, within a specified period before they come into operation.     It cannot always be assumed however that orders madeunder the former procedure are urgent and those under the latter procedureless urgent.     Statutory orders are made under a wide variety of legislativeprovisions and do not fall into a consistent pattern.    The government therefore concludes that no suoh power of delay would be practicable atthis stage.       The whole subject of subordinate legislation might however be considered by a joint seleet committee of both Houses, including thequestions whether an effective control could be devised to ensure that agovernment could not circumvent the delaying powers of the Lords over billsby incorporating in subordinate legislation matters which should be incorporated in Acts of Parliament, and whether it might be possible to rationalise the division between matters thought suitable for the affirmativeand negative procedures.       This idea is developed more fully in paragraphs-8 of Appendix II.Law lords55.    The term &apos;law lord&apos; is used here to cover all those members of the House of Lords who are entitled to form a judioialquorum under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.     They include:(a) the Lord Chancellor and serving Lords of Appeal in Ordinary(the latter hold life peerages created under the AppellateJurisdiction Acts 1876-1947*   they are at present nine in number but the statutory maximum has been increased to elevenunder the Administration of Justice Act 1968);(b) former Lord Chancellors and retired Lords of Appeal inOrdinary (at present there are two of the former and eight- 31 -
of the latter);   and &quot; - -(e)   other peers who hold or have held high judicial office:   forexample, the Lord Chief Justice or the Master of the Rolls(at present there are three such peers).As members of the House of Lords the law lords at present exercise twofunctions:   a judicial function which arises from the position of theHouse as the supreme appellate court of the United Kingdom;   and a more general function as ordinary but specialist members of the House as thesecond chamber of Parliament.56.     The judicial functions of the House of Lords have not been examined inthe context of the proposed reform and no change is contemplated in the responsibilities or rights of law lords in relation to the judicial businessof the House *     In particular, all law lords would continue to be able to vote on the judicial business of the House, regardless of the attendancequalification or any restriction on age.     They would includeformer Lord Chancellors and retired Lords of Appeal in Ordinary since theyoften continue to take part in judicial business.57.    As regards the law lords&apos; more general function, their responsibilities and rights are not at present in any way different in law from those of otherpeers but a convention has been developed under which serving law lords do not generally participate in party political controversy:   they may speak oncontroversial matters but do so in their specialist capacity as men learnedin the law.    As skilled and experienced lawyers however they have a valuable part to play in the consideration of public bills and thejurisprudential aspects of legislation generally.     In addition, four lawlords must, under standing order, be included in any meeting of the Lords&apos;Committee for Privileges when considering a peerage case^   a law lordis usually the chairman of the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, andlaw lords sit regularly on the sessional and House committees and act ineffect as their legal advisers.     Their knowledge and experience shouldcontinue to be fully available to the reformed House for its non-judicial(1) i.e. a disputed claim to a peerage.
business but those whose work takes place outside the House, for example in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, might not be able to meetthe attendance requirement which would be a condition for the exercise of voting rights.    The Government believes it would be appropriate for allserving law lords, i,e. the Lord Chancellor, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary andother peers, such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, whohold high judicial office, to possess voting rightsj   but since any distinction between those who could meet the attendance requirement and thosewho could not would be entirely arbitrary, it is proposed that all servinglaw lords should possess the right to vote by virtue of their office,irrespective of their age or attendance.     Law lords who have retired fromthose offices would however be subject to the ordinary rules and qualify for voting rights on non-judicial business only if they met the attendancerequirement and had not passed the age of retirement.Bishops58,    There are at present 26 bishops of the Church of England who haveseats in the House of Lords.      They are the Srehbishops of Canterbury andYork and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, all of whom sit &apos;ex officio&apos;,and 21 other bishops by seniority of appointment to diooesan sees.    All hold their seats during their tenure of their sees.59.    There are arguments both for excluding bishops from the reformed House  andfor their retention.     For excluding them it can be argued that it is anomalousfor bishops of the Church of England to have any special place in a reformed house of Lords which, as part of a modern Parliament, must be an essentiallysecular institution.     On the other hand, the House consists historicallyof lords spiritual and temporal, and the Church of England as the establishedchurch in England has a speoial relationship, some aspects of which aredelicately balanced, with the State and with the Crown.     The presence ofoishope in the House of Lords is an integral part of that relationship.The Church is in the unique position that its dignitaries are appointed bytoe Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister;   permanent changes in itsiiturgy require the approval of Parliament;   its courts are constitutedV statute and the duties of the clergy towards the community are founded10n COmnon or statute law;   its legislative powers under the Church of- 33 -
England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 are &quot;based on a particular relation withParliament;   and the Queen is its &quot;Supreme Governor &quot;and necessarily amember of it.   No other church is subject to parliamentary control of thiskind, and it is within this whole pattern of Church and State relationshipthat the 26 bishops have seats in the House of Lords.    The relationshipis at present under investigation by the Commission on Church and state which was set up by the two archbishops at the request of the ChurchAssembly in 19-66 and which has not yet reported.60.    A decision to esolude bishops from the reformed House of Lords, orfundamentally to alter their position in it, would affect the Church*orelationship with the State and prejudice the discussions which are takingplace in the Archbishops&apos; Commission.    The Government believes that theChurch should first reach its own conclusions on this subject and that decisions made in the context of the reform of the House of Lords shouldnot anticipate any fresh consideration of the whole issue of the Church and state relation.      Some adjustment in the position of bishops would benecessary in the context of a two-tier House and smaller numbers generally,but pending the settlement of wider questions of Church and State,, the adjustments should be the minimum necessary to preserve the relative positionof the bishops so far as possible unchanged.61.    it is therefore proposed that, at least for the present, there shouldcontinue to be a place for bishops both as speakers and as voters in the reformed House, but since the House would be reduced in size their totalnumber would be gradually reduced from 26 to 16.     No bishop who is now a member of the House would be excluded, but as bishops retire from theirsees, and therefore from the House, those other than the two archbishopsand the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester would be replaced on thebasis of one new bishop for every two retirements until 16 remained.     Thetwo awhbishops and these three bishops would be replaced by their successorsas at present;   otherwise, new bishops would succeed in order of seniority,again as at present, but any who preferred not to become members of theHouse would not be obliged to do so and membership would then devolve uponthe next most senior bishop who was willing to become a member.    Bishopsother than the two archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and- 3^ -
Winchester would also be allowed to retire from the House before retiringfrom their sees if they wished to do so.      In this way a degree of flexibility would be introduced whioh eould assist the Ctareh to have as its members in the House of Lords those bishops who would be its most effective representatives - a consideration whioh would become moreimportant as their total number was reduced.62.   The arguments for retaining bishops as members of the reformed Housepending the conclusion of the Commission on Church and State are alsoarguments for allowing some of them to retain voting rights, eventhough their diocesan   duties might make it impossible for them to meetthe attendance requirement.    The two archbishops and the Bishops ofLondon, Durham and Winchester who are at present * ex official&apos; members ofthe House would therefore continue as * ex official&apos; voting members, exempt from the attendance requirement and restriction on age.Rights of peere to vote in parliamentary elections63-   Traditionallys peers have been disqualified from voting in parliamentary elections on the ground that the peerage is a separateEstate of the Realm, distinct from the Commons Estate, and a member ofthe first has no right to influence the composition of the second.    Thisdoctrine evolved at a time when the powers and influence of the two Houses were more nearly equal than they are today.    a consequence of the doctrine was the anomalous situation in which some members of the peerage were   entitled neither to sit in the House of Lordsnor to vote in parliamentary elections:   for example, Scottish peers otherthan those eleoted as representative peers.    These anomalies were removed by the Peerage Act 1963* which allowed all peers and peeresses either to sit in the House of Lords or, if not, to vote in parliamentary elections(provided that they were qualified as regards age and residence).    TheGovernment does not consider that, in the context of the reformed House,it would any longer be appropriate to maintain a peer1s disqualificationfrom voting in parliamentary elections, whether or not he was entitled to sit ia the House of Lords.    Such a disqualification is an anachronism ins aodera democracy where the right to take part in the process of choosing- 35 -
the members of the elected chamber should be fundamental and universal,and no such bar applies to members of the second chamber in other democraticcountries such as Australia, Canada and the United States of America.All peers, therefore, whether or not they were members of the reformed house, would in future be qualified to vote in parliamentary elections.Rights of peers to sit in the House of Commons or to surrendertheir membership of the House of Lords6k.    A peer is also disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons unless he has renounced his title under the Peerage Act 19^3*    It would clearly be absurd for any person to be entitled to a seat in both Houses ofParliament, and this disqualification would therefore be continued forpeers who are members of the reformed House.    Since succession to ahereditary peerage would no longer give any right to membership of the House ofLords, however, all future peers by succession would have the right to sit in the House of Commons if elected, and they would no longer be required to surrender their titles in order to do so.     Nevertheless, it is proposedthat the provision in the Act of 1?63 which would allow them to renouncetheir titles should not be repealed, since some might wish to do so for reasons unconnected with membership of the House of Commons.     It would be consistent with this approach to include also a transitional provisionfor those peers who sit only by right of succession and did not receivelife peerages when the reform came into effect:   it is therefore proposedthat those who chose to exercise their option to withdraw from membership of the House of Lords (see paragraph 38 above) should thereby gain theright to sit in the House of Commons if elected.      There would, however,be no provision for nominated peers to surrender either their membership of the House or their titles.Functions and procedure of the reformed House65.    The Government looks forward to a review of the functions and procedures of the two Houses which it proposes should take place once themain reform had come into effect.     Such a review would be an important
continuation of the process of improving the efficiency of Parliament but,since it would more properly be carried out by,the two Houses, the Governmenthas not made any speoific proposals itself.    Appendix II is based on a paper submitted by the Government to the Inter-Party Conference and sets out some possible developments which might be examined by a joint selectcommittee at an early date after the reform had come into effect.Working of the House of Lords after reform66., It has already been suggested in paragraph 29 above that a committeeshould be established to review periodically the composition of the reformed house and to report either to the Prime Minister or to Parliament itself onany deficiencies in the balance and quality of its membership which it might find.   Its chairman would be a person of national standing, but without party political affiliations;   other members would inolude representatives of thepolitical parties and persons without party political affiliations in roughlyequal proportions.   Attention has been drawn to the importance of the crossbench peers in the reformed House and to the fact that their presence is vital to safeguard its independence.   As stated in paragraph &quot;\h above theydo not at present act in any way as an organised group with a sense ofcorporate identity and their voting and speaking record in recent years shows thatthose who -are active in the House are indeed genuine independents who do not giveregular support to any one party.   There is no reason to think they   would cease to act in this way in the future or become in any sense a new constitutional force, but it would nevertheless be important to ensure thatno undue party bias developed among them.   As part of it general task theproposed committee should therefore confirm that the cross bench peerscontinued to act in this spirit.67.  Certain other aspects of the reformed House which would also need to be kept under periodical review have already been mentioned above.Tney include the size and the party balance of the voting House, particularlyin relation to any new parties which might emerge, or to changes in therelative strength of the existing parties, and also the need to take account ofcoalitions or divisions within parties.   Another vitally important aspect*ould be the need to secure amongst the members of the House as a whole asuitable range of knowledge and experience, not only of national andj ]1 ^national affairs but also of those matters whioh are of special concern- 37 -
to the various parts and regions of the United Kingdom.    The proposed committee should also consider these subjeots when  neoessary.    Thecommittee or a sub-committee might also have a valuable role in preliminarythinking on the development of procedure and functions in the reformed house, especially where they might impinge on the work of and proceduraldevelopments in the House of Commons (see paragraph 65 above), but it shouldnot seek to derogate from the responsibilities which the two Houses exercisethrough existing machinery.Conclusions68.    The Governmenfs proposals can be summarised as follows?(a) The reformed House of Lords should be a two-tier structure comprisingvoting peers, with a right to speak and vote, and speaking peers, with aright to speak but not generally to vote (paragraph 35)*(b) After the reform came into effect, succession to a hereditary peerageshould no longer carry the right to a seat in the House of Lords butexisting peers by succession would have the right to sit as speakingmembers for their life-time (paragraph 35 ).(c) Voting peers would be exclusively nominated peers, but some peers bysuccession would be created life peers and therefore become qualified tobe voting peers (paragraph 36&quot;).(d) Speaking peers would include nominated peers who did not meet therequirements of voting membership, and peers who at the time of the reformsat by right of succession (paragraph 37).(e) Peers who at the time of the reform sat by right of succession wouldhave an opportunity to withdraw from the House if they wished to do so(paragraph38 ).(f) Voting peers would be expected to play a full part in the work of theHouse and required to attend at least one-third of the sittings;   they wouldbe subject to an age of retirement (paragraphs 42 and 43).(g) The voting House would initially consist of about 230 peers, distributed between the parties in a way which would give the government a small majorityover the opposition parties, but not a majority of the House as a whole
including those without party allegiance (paragraphs 44 - 46).(n)  Speaking peers would be able to ask questions and move motions andalso to serve in committee j but not to vote on the floor of the House orill any committee for the consideration of legislation (paragraph 47).(i)  The reformed House should include a suitable number of peers able to speak with authority on the problems and wishes of Scotland, Wales,Northern Ireland and the regions of England (paragraph 48)*(j)  Voting peers should be paid at a rate whioh would reflect their responsibilities and duties, but the question should be referred to anindependent committee or the Prioes and Incomes Board (paragraph 49).(k)  The reformed House should be able to impose a delay of six months onthe passage of an ordinary public bill on which there was disagreement between the two Houses;   it should then be possible to submit the bill forRoyal Assent provided that a resolution to that effect had been debatedand passed in the House of Commons.   The period of delay should be capableof running into a new session or into a new parliament (paragraphs 50 and 51).-(1)  The reformed House should be able to require the House of commons to reconsider an affirmative order, or to consider a negative order, towhich the House of Lords disagreed, and its disagreement should no longer be final (paragraphs 53 and 54).(m)  There should be a place in the reformed House for law lords andbishops (paragraphs 55 - 62).(n)  All peers should in future be qualified to vote in parliamentary elections (paragraph 63).(0)  Future peers by succession and existing peers by succession who chose-to renounce their membership of the House of Lords should be enabled to sit in the House of Commons if elected (paragraph 64).(p)  A review should be made of the functions and procedures of the twoHousbs once the main reform has come into effect (paragraph 65 and appendix II ),(q)  A committee should be established to review periodically the composition of the reformed House;   it should have a chairman of national standing but without party political affiliations and its members would include representatives of the politioal parties and persons without party politioalaffiliations in roughly equal number?

SECRIAPPENDIX I14PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE HOUSE OF lords ,    The movement to reform the House of Lords gathered its first realstrength in the late nineteenth oentury as a result of a combination of circumstances connected with the increasingly popular character of the Houseof Commons:   they   included the progress towards universal suffrage, the widening differences between the political parties, and the development ofthe party machines.     At the same time, the House of Lords was becoming moreand more a House of one party.     A crisis was produced by the lords  attacks on the radical legislation of the Liberal Government elected in 1906, notablyLloyd George !s Budget of 1909.   A bill was therefore introduced to limit the power of the Lords to frustrate decisions of the Commons - a power whichhad hitherto been unrestricted exoept to the extent that it was limited bythe Commons&apos; financial privilege.      Before the bill finally became law in1911, the party leaders attempted to reach an agreement on the future of theHouse, hut they failed amidst the violent controversies over Irish Home rule and other issues.2.    The Parliament Act 1911 in effect removed the Lords&apos; power to reject&quot;money bills&quot; as defined in that Act and provided that an ordinary publicbill could become law despite the lords  opposition if passed by the commons in three successive sessions, with not less than two years elapsing betweensecond reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the finalpassing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session.     The Actthus gave a government the capacity to carry through against the Lords&apos;opposition any legislation introduced in the first two sessions of a five-year parliament.    Nevertheless, the Lords were left with real powers of delay, which were promptly used on the Welsh Church Bill and on the Governmentof Ireland Bill:   the new Parliament Act procedure was applied to both before they were eventually enacted in 1914.3.    The provisions of the Parliament Act 1911 were however meant as a temper.?.;.^expedient:   as its preamble makes clear, it was intended that a thorough reform of the House of Lords would take place before long.     The preamble states:
&quot;and whereas it is intended to substitute for the House ofLords as it at present exists a second chamber constitutedon a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitutioncannot immediately be brought into operation......&quot;After 1911, however, continuing political troubles and the outbreak of thejirst World War prevented further aotion until the Conference appointed underthe chairmanship of Lord Bryce in ^r^^whose Report (Cd 9038) proposed a house three quarters of whose members would be elected indirectly by membersof the House of Commons on a regional basis, and one quarter would be chosen by a joint standing committee of both Houses, with certain proportions of hereditary peers and bishops.     The scheme made no progress because of thedissent of some members of the Conference and the political circumstances atthe time.k.    Between the two World Wars, a series of further proposals was made forthe wholesale reconstruction of the House but nothing came of them.     Then,in 1945, the Labour party pledged itself in its election manifesto not topermit its legislative programme to be obstructed by the House of Lords, andin 1947 the Labour Government brought forward a Parliament Bill.     The Billproposed a reduction from three to two in the number of sessions in which adisputed bill must be passed by the House of Commons and from two years toone in the period of delay from second reading in the House of Commons.    TheBill was first passed by the Commons at the end of 1947.    The second reading debate in the House of Lords was adjourned so that the proposals in the bill could be considered at a conference of party leaders, with a view to obtainingall-party agreement:   at the conference the representatives of the Labourparty would have been prepared to agree to a period of delay of nine months from the third reading of a bill in the House of Commons as an alternative to the period proposed in the Bill;   the representatives of the Liberal partyconcurred;   but those of the Conservative party felt unable to agree to and terms of reference were &quot;To inquire and report - (i) as to the nature and limitations of the legislative powers to be exercised by a reformedSecond Chamber.     (ii) as to the best mode of adjusting differences between the two Houses of Parliament.     (iii) as to the changes whichare desirable in order that the Second Chamber may in future be soconstituted as to exercise fairly the functions appropriate to aSecond Chamber.&quot;
period of delay of less than one year from third reading on the first occasion in the House of Commons.    The Labour party&apos;s representativesrejected this alternative on the ground that it could prevent the enactment of controversial legislation introduced in the fourth session of a parliament.No agreement was therefore reached and in 1949 the Parliament Bill was eventually enacted in it3 original form under the provisions of the parliament Act 1911.5.    Although the Conference of 1948 reached no agreement on powers, it made substantial progress towards finding a basis for agreement on the composition of a reformed House.     This is shown in the agreed statementpublished as a White Paper (dad 7380) after the breakdown of discussions.Paragraph 5 states that if agreement could have been reached generally,further consideration would have been given to reform of composition on thefollowing basis:(a) The second chamber should be complementary to and not a rival tothe lower House, and, with this end in view, the reform of theHouse of Lords should be based on a modification of its existing constitution as opposed to the establishment of a second chamberof a completely new type based on some system of election.(b) The revised constitution of the House of Lords should be suchas to secure as far as practicable that a permanent majority isnot assured for any one political party.(c) The present right to attend and vote based solely on heredityshould not by itself constitute a qualification for admission toa reformed second chamber.(a)Members of the second chamber should be styled &quot;Lords of Parliament&apos;and would be appointed on grounds of personal distinction or public service.They might be drawn either from hereditary peers,or from commoners who would be created life peers.(e)Women should be capable of being appointed Lords of Parliament inlike manner as men.Provision should be made for the inclusion in the second chamberof certain descendants of the Sovereign, certain lords spiritualand the law lords.
In order that persona without private means should not be excluded,some remuneration should be payable to members of the second chamber.00Peers who were not Lords of Parliament should be entitled to stand for election to the House of Commons, and also to vote at elections in the same manner as other citizens.(i)   Some provision should be made for the disqualification of a memberof the second chamber who neglects, or becomes no longer able orfitted, to perform his duties as such.6.    The major changes in the last 20 years have all been in accordance withthe above statement of principles:   the introduction of life peers was made possible by the Life Peerages Act 1958, which also allowed life peerages,with full rights of membership of the House of Lords, to be conferred onwomen.    Resolutions of the two Houses of Parliament in 1957 enabled peersto recover, within limits, expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at sittings of the House of Lords;   and the position of those peers who chosenot to attend the House was formalised by a leave of absence scheme intro-duced by standing order in 1958.     The Peerage Act 196&quot;3 allowed peers bysuccession to renounce their peerages, and also removed anomalies withinthe peerage.    Until 19&amp;3, 16 representative peers for Scotland were elected for each parliament by the holders of Scottish peerages, but those who were notelected could neither take part in the proceedings of the House of Lords norvote in parliamentary elections, no^ could they stand for election to the House ofCommons,    A similar disqualification applied to peers of Ireland, who had lost even their representation in the House of Lords because their electoralmachinery ceased to be operable in 1922 when the Irish Free State was estab-lished.    The Peerage Act 1963 opened membership of the House of Lords to allpeers of Scotland, and removed the disqualification of peers of Ireland from voting in parliamentary elections or standing for election   to the Houseof Commons.     The Act increased the number of women in the House of Lordsby admitting peeresses by succession.
APPENDIX it possible CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS AND procedure.   Reform of the powers and composition of the House of Lords wouldonen the way for a fresh look at the functions of the two Houses ofParliament.     It would be right for this to be undertaken, in the firstinstance, by a joint select committee on procedure of the two Houses.     Thefollowing are possible changes in functions and procedure which might beconsidered further in a context where a reformed House of Lords was availableto work in closer concert with the House of Commons than is possible todsy.This Appendix does not make any specific proposals since these are mattersmore properly dealt with by the Houses themselves;   but it may nevertheless be helpful to illustrate the wider advantages which might accrue to theBritish parliamentar3r system from a reform of the kind proposed.Public Bills:    general,    A substantial contribution towards improving the legislative processcoidd be obtained through a more even spread of the introduction ofpublic bills over the session.     More bills should therefore be introduced in the House of Lords.     In particular, bills should not be prevented fromstarting in the House of Lords because they are in some degree politicallycontroversial or because they incorporate financial provisions.     This isthe subject of a recommendation of the Sixth Report from the Commons&apos;Select Committee on Procedure (H.C. 1966-67, 539, paragraphs 7 and 8).Some waiver of the Commons&apos; financial privilege would be necessary, preferablyby standing order (on the model of the Commons&apos; Standing Order No.57), or alternatively by legislation in the context of a reformed House of Lords.3.    Obvious advantages would follow from a more even flow of bills fromone House to the other.     There is, however, the difficulty that major billsintroduced into the House of Lords would tend to reach the House of Commonsln ^e ^&amp;te spring when the Commons are pre-occupied with financial business.Additionally it might be necessary, in order to obtain full advantagefron an improved flow of legislation from one House to the other, toCrease the number of Cabinet and other Ministers in the House of Lords;
SECRET &apos; &apos; &quot; 1at present there are in the House only two Cabinet Ministers and onlythirteen other Ministers (including the Whips), of whom one is permanentlyat the United Nations and two others are not often able to attend theHouse because of other commitments.Public bills:   Committee procedureIf.,    If the Lords are to play a more useful part in legislation, itsight be desirable to adopt seme form of public bill committee procedure.It need not necessarily be modelled on the commons standing committees.It would be premature at this stage to make suggestions as to its precise form and function;   the question should be referred to a select committeeof the reformed House of Lords which would be asked to recommend to theHouse the type of public bill committee which it considered would be most useful.    The same select committee might also consider other aspects ofpublic bill procedure in the House of Lords:   for example, whether or not it is desirable to follow the example of the House of Commons in the useof second reading committees.Public bills:   Accelerated procedure5.    There are two possible ways of accelerating the legislative processfor bills of a kind which do not need consideration at as many stagesas the present procedures require:   the proceedings in one of the Housescould be curtailed, or some of the stages of consideration could be madea joint procedure.     Of these two possibilities, the latter seems the more promising.    A convention might be established that certain classes of bill should start in the House of Lords and then receive detailed examination by a joint committee of the two Houses.    Experience on consolidationbills indicates that under such an arrangement the main burden would fall on the Lords and very little of the Commons&apos; time would be neededwhen a bill reached the lower House.     Classes of bills suitable for thistreatment might include bills resulting from the work of the Law commissions and other technical but uncontroversial legislation such as that onmines and quarries.     A further possibility would be to commit to
a joint committee private members1 bills on controversial socialsubjects after they had received a second reading in eitherHoBse*Subordinate legislation.    Present procedures in relation to subordinate legislation may be thought to occupy time on the floor of both Houses unnecessarily, in so far asprayers are moved as a device for obtaining explanations or assuranceswithout being pressed to a division, and in so far as affirmative resolutions lead to debate on orders which are not matters of controversy.Moreover, the work  of the lords  Special Orders Committee duplicates tosome extent that of the Commons&apos; Statutory Instruments Committee.     the commons&apos; Select Committee on Procedure recommends in its SixthReport (H.C 1966-6?, 539) that it should be made possible to refer non-contentious affirmative resolutions and prayers to the Select Committeeon Statutory Instruments, subject to the same safeguards as exist for references to a second reading committee.     Given a reformed House of Lords,there would be scope for the development, under procedural resolutions, ofa joint procedure on these lines.    A joint committee might be set up toexercise the combined scrutinising functions of the Special OrdersCommittee and the Statutory Instruments Committee, but with a smallercombined membership.    All statutory instruments could then be referred tothis committee for scrutiny, with the exception of financial orders, whichwould be considered only by the Commons&apos; representatives and would be reported only to  that House;   but otherwise the committee would reportto both Houses.    Additionally, it should be possible for the jointcommittee to consider the merits of affirmative resolutions and prayers.Since it would probably be thought necessary to permit prayers against negativeorders whioh were expected to be pressed to a division, and affirmative resolutions on contentious orders, to be debated on the floor of the House,and since such debate would duplicate discussion in committee, one
procedure might be for the government to refer to the joint committee only those prayers whieh are not expected to be pressed to a division andaffirmative resolutions on non-contentious orders.     Motions to referresolutions and prayers to the committee would be subject to the samesafeguards as exist for reference of bills to a second reading committee.As regards proceedings in the committee on prayers or affirmative resolutions, it could be provided that Ministers and members of the Housewho were not members of the committee could speak but not vote, and couldexamine witnesses.    Alternatively, as recommended by the Commons&apos;Select Committee on Procedure, the joint committee could have a specifiednumber of members added by the Committee of Selection and would conductits debates in the manner of a standing committee.     The joint committeewould report to both Houses whether it recommended that an instrument be approved.    It is for consideration whether this recommendation would bep\it to the Houses for approval without opportunity for amendment or debate,as recommended by the Select Committee, or be open to debate where a givennumber of members so desired, despite the opportunity for objection on theoriginal motion to refer the matter to the joint committee.7.     In the longer term, the development of an effective joint procedure forscrutinising statutory instruments might enable provision to be made forthe amendment of statutory instruments, since a means would be available of reconciling differences between the two Houses, and even for abolishing the affirmative resolution procedure at least in its present form.     Butchanges of this magnitude could be considered by the joint selectcommittee when the new House of Lords was constituted.8.    If these broad proposals were adopted, a number of issues would remain to be considered in more detail by the proposed joint committee on procedure:   for example, the method of reference of matters for debate(an alternative procedure has been suggested for the automatic reference of all instruments, leaving the committee discretion to select topics for debate) and the proceedings in the two Houses on the report of the jointcommittee.
9,    A general reform of the functions and procedures of the House of!Lords, with an emphasis on joint committees, would provide a suitable occasion for reopening the question of extending the use of joint committees for the consideration of private bills.     This question wasexhaustively discussed by the Joint Committee on Private Bill Prooedurein 1955 (see paragraphs 55-65 of its Report - HL 14.58 - I, HC 139 - i)when it came to the conclusion that, on balance, it could not recommendany alteration in the present system.    The Committee did report, however,that the argument for a second hearing depends largely on the fact that,until the case for the promoters is deployed and the attitude of thegovernment is known, petitioners are placed at an unfair disadvantage.If a means could be found for the earlier deployment of the case for the promoters and the attitude of the government could be disclosed earlier,petitioners would not be at so great a disadvantage as they are at presentand joint committees might therefore be more freely used.    A change ofthis importance, however, could hardly be made without wide consultationamong interested parties and a recommendation from a further joint committeeon private bill procedure which   might also consider other business of aprivate character such as special procedure orders.Specialist committees10.    There is scope for involving the Lords in specialist or select committeethey could set up such committees, e.g. on the arts or aspects of law reform,in which the Commons might participate;   and vice versa.     It is suggestedin paragraph 11 (a) below that provision should be made for unequalmembership.    There are clearly some committees of the House of Commons,such as the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees, in which the lords should not participate and others such as the Nationalised IndustriesCoEunittee on which the House of Lords might be only sparsely represented.
Other committees such as ad hoc pre-legislation committees and committeesspecialising in the affairs of public departments might draw their membership equally from both Houses;   and yet others, for example, those on aspects of law reform, might be composed entirely of Lords orinclude only a small representation from the House of Commons.    Anysuch representation of the members of one House in a committee of theother would be subject to procedural decisions to be taken in theproposed joint select committee on prooedure.Other matters -11.    Other matters which might be pursued by the proposed joint selectcommittee on procedure are:(a) Enabling joint select committees to consist of unequalmembership;   at present the representation of each House ina joint committee must be equal, although there has been asingle exception to this rule.(b) Enabling joint select committees to appoint sub-committeesand, where desirable, to proceed by way of public debate.This would allow a joint committee to deal expeditiouslywith many aspects of subordinate legislation,(c) The right of a member of either House to attend and speak,but not to vote, in a joint committee of which he is nota member.     This would be an extension of the Lords&apos; standing order No,58 and could be convenient in a joint committeeon, for example, subordinate legislation.
Other committees such as ad hoc pre-legislation committees and committeespecialising in the affairs of public departments might draw their membership equally from both Housesj   and yet others, for example, those on aspects of law reform, might be composed entirely of Lords orinclude only a small representation from the House of Commons.

.3TKDX CPAELIAKBKT &apos;: BILLfrraft dated 15th ^October 1968,The draft bill is in four parts .      The first deals withcomposition, the second with powers in relation to public bills,the third with powers in relation to subordinate legislation andthe fourth contains supplementary provisions7       The draft effects the minimum changes in the lav; which arenecessary to implement the proposals in the draft White Paper.It does not purport to regulate the exercise of the Prerogativein respect of the creation of new peers,  and accordinglycontains no previsions specifically related to the proposals about the total numbers of peers to be comprised in the n&apos;-wMouse or in the voting nucleus,  or the balance within thatnucleus between peers supporting the Government, peers supportingother parties and cross bench peers.      The draft as it stands issimilarly silent about the creation cf new peers to representScotland or other parts or regions of the United Kingdom..      The:.-raft is also silent an matters cf parlitoont-ary procedure ,/M&apos;clicould better fee determined by the two houses themselves.I - Composition3-     Clause 1,    The main object of this clause is to exclude from the reformed house of Lords all hereditary peers who maysucceed to peerages in the future.      The reference to the peerageof England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdomindicates that it applies to all hereditary peerages and thatspecific representation for Scotland,  provided in the Unionarrangements of V/Q&quot;/ and strengthened by section 4 of the PeerageAct 1963,  is to come to an end.4. As already stated, the present draft makes no provision toreplace the existing (hereditary) representation of Scotland by appropriate representation in the nominated House.      It is for- 1 -SECRET
consideration whether such provision should be made,  cither inthe clause itself or in a preamble to the bill.      Existing peershv&apos; succession who are members of - the present -&quot;louse retain their membership for life.      Intermediate cases are dealt with asfollows: -(a) existing peers by succession who are under age at thecommencement date (see clause   16) are excludedr(b) existing peers by succession who are. of full age butdisqualified at the commencement date ( e. g   as beingaliens) are excluded,  subject however to an exception(subsection (3) of clause   15) in the case of any temporarydisqualification on account of bankruptcy:    and(c) existing peers by succession who are of full age and notdisqualified at the commencement date are included ifthey have already applied for the writ of summons orapply for it within the next six months,5.      The peers covered by (c) above include both tho peer who hasrecently succeeded and is in process of proving his title when thebill com-s into force - a process which in certain cases may takea considerable tine - and the peer who has not previously decidedto fake up his membership of the house.      The six months&apos;  extensionis relevant to the latter class -6.     Subsection (3) is intended to resolve the question whether an application for the writ is made when the applicant first asks for the writ or when the application is finally completed with all necessary evidence,      For the purposes of the clause, writtennotice of intention to apply is sufficient./*     Subsection (4) enables any existing peer by succession who isa member of the House to resign his membership within one year afterthe commencement date.      Since peers by succession will not as suchto qualified to vote in the reformed Mouse,  there may be some whoSECRET
ECRET -     152will not   wish to retain their membership.      Those who resignwill be qualified, under clause 14, to sit in the House of Commonsif elected.g.     Clause 2.     This clause provides fcr the division of theI reformed House into  &apos;voting&apos;  peers and other p-ers, the former top consist exclusiveI3&apos; of peers of first creation.      The latter are referred to in the draft White Paper as  1 speaking&apos;  peers, butI that particular description is not used in the draft bill        TieIII voting rights of these peers are circumscribed by subsection (2)Iff of the clause, which withholds the right to vote -(a) on any question in the House itself (including any committee of the whole House) and(b.) on any question in a committee of the House for theconsideration of legislation,  or of subordinate legislation falling within clauses. 1 ?-13 of the bill.B 9-     The subsection is thus a compromise between two distinctl$j conceptions, namely (a) that the house should be composed of peers&apos;. with votes and peers without votes,  and  (b) that the house shouldjjl be composed of legislative and non-legislative peers.      Themm committees in which a  &apos; speaking&apos; or  &apos;non-voting&apos; peer cannot voteH include committees dealing with local and private bills.      The- disqualification will apply whether the vote is taken on a divisionor by collecting voices10..    Subsection (3)  saves the right of a peer who is not a votingpeer to take part in any proceeding though not entitled to vote.I Such peers will thus foe entitled to give notice of and move amend-ments to bills as well as other motions,  and indeed to introducetheir own bills.lb    Clause 3.    This clause provides for the deposit of &quot;votingBj declarations&quot; by those peers of first creation who wish to beI voting peers.      The declaration has to be made for each parliament;h! aw* con&quot;tinues in force throughout the parliament unless withdrawnRET

Subsection (3)  introduces a retirement age for voting peersAs drafted it would apply to any parliament summoned after theend of 1975s  and would prevent a peer who had attained 7? beforethe dissolution of the last preceding parliament from making avoting declarationo13.    Under subsection (4)  a voting declaration must normally be deposited within one month of the issue of the writ of summonsto the parliament:    a peer created during a parliament will thus have a month in which to deposit a voting declaration,  and existing peers will have approximately a month from the disso-lution of the previous parliament,      The time limit may beextended by   the house; for special reasons,.      Some such provision is needed for cases in which a peer is unable to deposit hisdeclaration within the month on account of illness or otheremergency;    but it is not intended to enable a peer to obtain,leave to deposit a declaration out of time as a matter of course for the purpose,  for example,  of giving his vote on a controversiprivate peer&apos;s bill - still less to enable him to make a seconddeclaration.      Some doubt has been felt whether the words &quot;forspecial reasons&quot; are adecuate to distinguish between the one case and the othrr, but it is thought that some indication shouldho given that leave is to be granted only in exceptional circumstances,H&apos;-     Subsection (5) provides for the voluntary withdrawal ofa voting declaration.

Subsection (5) provides for the voluntary withdrawal ofa voting declaration.      This,  among other things, would enable a peer who foresees that he will be unable to meet the minimumattendance requirement  (clause 4) to surrender his vote forthwith
ET r-^      15 5instead of waiting for it to be withdrawn at the end of thecurrent session-Clause 4 deals with the attendance requirement-      Subsection(1) provides that a voting declaration is treated as withdrawn ifthe peer fails to comply with the requirement in any session,  andhe will not then be able to make a further declaration until theend of the parliament.,      Subsection  (?.) defines the requirementas attendance at sittings of the House or of committees on anumber of days equal to not less than one-third of the days on whichthe house meets during the session for business other than judicialbusiness.      A peer would thus be able to count attendance oncommittees on days when the House itself was not sitting but suchdays would not be added to the total from which the proportioncf one-third would bo calculated.      From this total would be deducted, in the case of the peer created during a session, anydays before the issue of the writ of summons j    and in the caseof every peer,  any period during which he was absent with the leave of the house on account of ill health or of parliamentary or other public business, or during which he was disqualified fromsitting.      The expression &quot;public business&quot; is not defined andits interpretation would be left to the House itself.      Peers      &quot;m0:who are disqualified woulds  in practice, be those who arc detainedas suffering from mental illness (see clause 7) or are bankrupt.16.    Difficulty might arise in applying the attendancerequirement in an unexpectedly short session,  since a number of peers might be found not to have met the requirement havingplanned to  &apos;make up1 the necessary number of attendances later in the session.      In order to prevent such peers from having their voting declarations automatically regarded as withdrawn,subsection (4) provides that a session in which the house sitson less than 30 days should not be counted for this purpose.
if.    Subsection (5) of the clause would ensure that a day onwhich the House sits on after    midnight is not counted as twofor the purposes of the attendance requirement,18.    Clause 5 defines the special position of Ministers and the holders of high judicial office.      The draft White Paper proposes that they should be exempt from both the age of retirement andthe attendance requirement;    this exemption can most conveniently be achieved by the provision in subsection (I) under which theywould not be required to make the voting declaration-&apos; ion to whichthe other two requirements are related.      Subsection (?) dealswith the position of a Minister or holder of high judicial officewho retires from office during a parliament.      Under paragraph(a) he will automatically retain full voting rights for the re-mainder of the session in which he retires,  while paragraph (b)makes it possible for him to remain a voting peer thereafter,if hf so wishes and is within the age limit, by allowing him todeposit a voting declaration within one month of the opening ofthe next session.      This right to make a voting declaration willbe available even though the peer concerned may have made an earlier declaration and withdrawn it or been unable to meet the attendance requirement.39.    The clause applies to the Leader of the Opposition and theChief Opposition Whip in the House of Lords in the same way asto Ministers.20.    Subsection (3) preserves the right of a peer who is one ofthe Lords of Appeal qualified to sit on judicial business to give his vote on an appeal to the house.      Lords of Appeal in Ordinaryand serving holders of high judicial office who are peers of firstcreation will be qualified as voting peers under clause 5of the bill:    but Lords of Appeal will also include certain peerswho have resigned from high judicial office and some of these may net be able to comply with the minimum attendance requirement
or may be over age.      The judgement on an appeal is given in theHouse, and the question is put to the vote in the ordinary way,2/1,    Clause 6 provides for the reduction in the number of bishopsin the house from 9.6 to 16 and for the method by which it wouldbe achieved..      The words &quot;during his tenure of the. see&quot; in sub-section (3)(b) would allow a bishop who had disclaimed his rightto sit in the house a further option to accept a writ if he istranslated to another see:    such an option might bo desirable for a bishop who is translated from a see where attendance wouldbe difficult to one where it would not-.      Subsection (4) allowsthe two archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchesterto retain their voting rights  &apos; ex officio&apos;,.22.    Clause 7 disqualifies a person who is liable to be detainedas suffering from mental illness from receiving a writ of summonsor from sitting or voting in the house-       There is a corresponding provision for members of Parliament in section 137 of the MentalHealth Act  1959, j  but peers are not at present subject to any suchdisqualification..      The object of that section was to enablethe member&apos;s seat to be declared vacant,  and it contains thesafeguard of an independent medical examination by doctorsreporting to the Speaker to ensure that the seat is declared vacantonly where the illness is sufficiently prolonged..      A similarexamination may not be thought necessary in the different circum-stances of the house of Lords.      As drafted, the clause would apply not only to peers but also to bishops.23&apos;    There is no reference to a provision on this subject in thedraft White paper and it is not an integral part of the schemefor the reform.      The clause might be criticised on the grounds that it does not deal with informal patients or those sufferingfrom other forms of mental disorder  (although the corresponding provision for members of Parliament is similarly restricted);and it might attract derisive comment generally.      Gn the other
hand it would have considerable practical convenience in making it unnecessary to rcend a writ of summons to a peer who was liableto be detained,  and in making- it possible to exclude him from theHouse if he presented himself-,  for example during a period ofhome leave.II- Powers:    public bills7.4,    This part of the bill replaces section 2 of the parliament act ?.9ll:    it does not affect the provisions related to money bill which are contained in sec&apos;- ion I of that Act,      The definition of a money bill in that section is perhaps not altogether satis-factory in modern conditions since some bills which are common!;/regarded as  &quot;money bills&apos; do not fall within it;    but it maybe thought difficult to find an alternative which would be more satisfactory and v/ould not lead to unnecessary controversy.?5&apos;.    Clause 8.    Subsection (1) defines the types of bill to whichthe new procedure shall apply - broadly those to which section ?.of the Parliament Act 1911 applies at present.      The expression&quot;public bill&quot; is defined by clause   IS so as to exclude bills to confirm provisional orders,  amongst which are bills to confirmScottish provisional orders under the Private LegislationProcedure (Scotland) Act 1936, but not bills to confirm orders to which the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 1945 appliesThe latter fall within the scope of the present Parliament Actprocedure and it may be thought right for the new procedure toapply to them also.      The exception for bills containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of parliament corres-ponds with the existing exception in section 2(l)  of the parliament Act 191:1.26,    Subsection (2.)  provides that,  after the six months&apos;  periodof delay (see clause 9)  a bill disagreed to by the House of Lordscan be presented for Royal Assent upon a resolution of the Houseof Commons,  and subsection (3) defines disagreement for this
SECRET w     159purpose...      An important objective is to ensure that a bill isnot disagreed to simply because the Lords    have not. passed it by the end of the session;    if it were, the subsequent provision in clause 9 that the bill may be presented for Royal Assentnotwithstanding any intervening prorogation or dissolution wouldmake serious inroads on the essential principle that all uncom-pleted business lapses at the end of the session,      It follows thata state of disagreement must be created by an overt and identified-fiabie action on the part of one or both Houses.      The simplesituation where the Lords reject a bill,  or reject or amend a motion for it to be read at any stage or passed,  is defined inparagraph (a).      Paragraph (b) provides for the case in whichthe bill is passed by the House of Lords with amendments some or all of which are disagreed to by the Commons.      In such casesthe Lords are treated as having disagreed to the bill if theyinsist on an amendment to which the Commons have disagreed,  or if they disagree to a compromise amendment offered by the commons and insist on their disagreement.      The paragraph is so draftedas to give the Lords the last opportunity to resile from theposition previously taken up by them and so avoid a disagreementwithin the meaning of the clause.27.    Paragraphs (a) and (b) accordingly cover all cases of overtdisagreement on the part of the Lords.      But it remains possiblein theory for the Lords to strangle a bill sent up from the commons without overt disagreement - for example by adjourningdebates, or disagreeing &apos;to formal motions necessary in order tomake progress:    and even after the bill has been passed-with amendments there is in theory considerable scope for evasiveaction short of insistence on an original amendment or disagree-ment.      Paragraphs (c) and (d) have been included to insure against this situation.      They would operate only after the expiration of the minimum of 60 parliamentars^ days from the time when the
bill is sent up to the Lords and only within the same session.They would not therefore be available in the case of a bill sent up towards the end of the aoestion.2,8.    Under paragraph (c), the rejection by the Lords of a formalor business motion necessary for the progress of the bill, madeby the peer in charge of the bill and oxprRsood to be made underthe clause, would be treated as disagreement to the bill.      Thisprovision, standing alone, goes some way to meet the problem,but not the whole way.      The debate on the motion could itself be adjourned rather than the motion rejected;    and the motionwould be inappropriate at the stage of consideration of Commons&apos;Reasons or amendments in lieu of Lords amendments-.      Paragraph(d), on the other hand, would cover all possible situations b3^means of a resolution passed by the Commons that the bill betreated as disagreed to by the Lords.      The paragraph would requireat least ten parliamentary days notice to be given of thenecessary motion.      The notice itself might be sufficient to ensureprogress in the house of Lords, in which case the resolution neednot be moved.      This paragraph may be though objectionable asleaving too much in the control of the Commons.      On the otherhand it may be thought that nothing else would provide completeinsurance against delaying tactics in the case of a particularbill.29.    The term &quot;parliamentary day&quot; is defined in clause 15(1).3^-    Subsection (4) preserves the right of either House to seek agreement on a &quot;disagreed1 bill under the existing procedures.Subsection (5)  is formal, but the detailed procedure may require futher examination.31.    Clause 9 deals with the six months&apos;  &quot;period of delay&quot;,which runs from the time of disagreement or,  if the bill isdisagreed to more than 60 parliamentary days from the day on which&quot;che bill was sent to the House of Lords,  from the last of those
days.over aSubsection (?.) provides for tlw p*si-ioa of d^lay to extendprorogation or dissolution.      The clause would allow thenew procedure to be applied to a bill whatever the stage in thelossion at which it reached the House of Lords,  provided thatthe Lords had overtly disagreed to the bill before the end ofthe session   - i.e. under paragraphs (a) or  (b) of clause 8(3).      Inthese circumstances it would therefore be possible for the procedure to be applied to a bill even if it had reached the House ofLords less than two months before the end of the session.32.        Subsection (3) enables either House to take the initiative in seeking a compromise during the period of delay.      This provision is intended to cover the situation where a prorogation ordissolution has taken place during the period of dela3^,    a compromise within the session could normally be brought aboutI under clause 8(4).      Under subsection (3) as drafted,  either house may propose to the other a compromise amendment or seriesof amendments.      If the amendment or amendments are accepted bythe ether House, the period of delay comes to an end,  and the billcan be presented for Royal Assent forthwith,  if the Commons soresolve.      In that event, the compromise amendments are of courseincluded in the bill as enacted.      No provision is made forcounter-proposals or further exchanges between the two Houses.The compromise offered must be accepted or rejected as it stands.I!&apos;        Clause  10.      Subsection (1) enables the Commons to include thebill as presented for Royal Assent government or other acceptableamendments made by the Lords before disagreement:      The need forsuch a provision might arise if,  for example, the bill wereEjected by the Lords on third reading.      The remainder of theclause is formal and reproduces corresponding provisions in theFarlianent Act  1911.
III   - Powers:    subordinate legislationClause 11 is introductory,  clause 12 enables the commons to override a negative resolution passed by the Lords andrlause 13 enables the Commons to override an affirmative resolution passed by the Lords.      It is hoped that the description of thevarious types of affirmative orders in subsection (1) of clause13 is comprehensisivej    if any procedures are found which it doesnot cover, it will be necessary to amend the subsection andthe extension of the period at the end of which an order orinstrument would cease to have effect, unless approved by bothHouses, in cases where the resolution for approval is rejected by the Lords towards the end of the period3    but there is noother provision for overcoming delaying tactics parallel to thatincluded for public bills in clause 8(3 ) (c ) and (d).IV - Supplementary provisions35. Clause 14 gives to all peers, whether members of the reformed House or not, the right to vote at general elections and, to those who are not members of the House of Lords, theright to sit in the House of Commons if elected.36. Clause  15 deals with interpretation and includes defini-tions of a number of expressions used in the bill.37&apos; Clause 16 deals with the commencement and a transitionalprovision.      Subsection (2) represents the views of theGovernment as set out in paragraphs 70 and 71 of the draft-frdte Paper.      Subsection (3) gives the necessary transitionalprovision for peers who may be bankrupt at the date ofcommencement.^* Clause 17.
