OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)UNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERS IN KENYA ANDUGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 16th December the Ministerial Committee on Immigration and community Relations considered the attached note prepared by officials.2.      If the Governments of Kenya and Uganda carry out their expressedintentions, and the prospect is that they will, we face a serious situation.At worst some 30,000 Asian immigrants, including dependants, may seek to enter this country from East Africa next year in addition to the normalflow of voucher holders and dependants from elsewhere in theCommonwealth unless either drastic action is taken to reduce this normalflow or we can succeed, with the co-operation of the Indian Government,in diverting a good part of the exodus from East Africa to India itself.This is on top of the Asians already being admitted, mainly from Kenya,under the arrangements made following the passage of the commonwealth immigrants Act, 1968 last February.    We have succeeded in keeping them down to an annual rate of 6, 000-7, 000.3.      So far the problem of United Kingdom passport holders has been limited to East Africa, but there is a potential danger, though on present information it is not immediately imminent, of a similar situation arising in the Federation of South Yemen where there are some 30, 000 Asian orSomali United Kingdom passport holders at risk of being denied localcitizenship under the policy, in this instance, of &quot;arabisation&quot;.4.      The Ministerial Committee took no decision on policy, but they didon the handling of the problem arising in Kenya and Uganda.    Paragraph (d)on page 5 of the attached note draws attention to action that could be takenin the context of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;&apos; Conference, and the ministerial Committee were agreed that this gathering would provide thebest opportunity for bilateral discussions with Presidents Kenyatta andObote as well as with other Commonwealth leaders who might be able tobring pressure upon the Governments of Kenya and Uganda to moderatetheir actions, if not their policies.    I am taking up with the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the question whether we ought not straightaway to put the relevant Commonwealth Governments on notice that we would like to discuss these matters with them informally duringthe course of the forthcoming Conference.C(68) 130COPY NO.20th December, 1968CABINET-1-
SECRET &apos;    v3635.       The Ministerial Committee also thought that the Cabinet should be aware of the domestic as well as the Commonwealth aspects o  the situation,particularly the extent to which it would be possible or desirable to offsetan increase in numbers arriving from East Africa by reductions elsewhere.The political implications at home needed to be weighed so that contingencyplans could be prepared.6.      I am accordingly circulating this memorandum to the Cabinet.L, J. C,Home Office, S. 1/7.1.20th December, 1968
364U.K..PASSPORT HOLDERS IN KENYA AND UGANDAMemorandum by Foreign and Commonwealth office at their meeting on k December the Official Committee on immigration and Community Relations considered two paperscirculated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the intentions of, the Kenyan and Ugandan Governments in regard totheir Africanisation     programmes and the likely effect thatthese would have on the Asian communities resident in thosecountries.    Since the great majority of the Asian communities in these two countries are citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies the measures now decided upon by Kenya and underconsideration in Uganda cannot fail to bring heavy pressure upon our immigration policy,   This paper states the facts asfar as they are known and indicates possible courses of action.Developments in Kenya2.     On 19 October the Permanent Secretary in the Office of thePresident informed our High Commissioner in Nairobi that the kenya Government estimated that by the end of 1969 the workpermits of some 95OO0 non-Kenya citizens of Asian origin, 90$of whom would be citizens of the U.K.  and Colonies, would haveexpired.    Only a few of those permits would be renewed and it was expected that some 27*000 people would be likely to leave Kenya,possibly for the United Kingdom,    The Permanent Secretary askedhow the United Kingdom proposed to deal with this problem, given that our present policy is to allot only 1,500 vouchers a year for entry into the United Kingdom &quot;for the whole of East Africa&quot;.Further enquiries by the High Commission have indicated that the950OO expiring work permits will be spread over two years from june 1968 to June 1970.    Some of these people have already lost their employment and have received vouchers from the 1,200 or soissued this year.    The rate of cancellation is expected to besteady, thus the number of cancellations in 1969 may be of theorder of 5*000 of whom about L,500 would be citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies and cancellations would probably oontinue atthe same rate or perhaps higher in 1970.
It developments in UgandaH 3,    We know that the Uganda Government, in pursuit of a policy of Africanisation, are considering legislation which could &quot;beI introduced at short notice, the effect of which, by withdrawingIf all permits and renewing them only on a selective basis, would be designed to reduce the Asian population of Uganda from 80,000m to some 20,000 over a period of 5 years.    It is understood thatI the Uganda Government intend that about 20,000 of these peopleI should leave Uganda within 6 months of the introduction of them legislation.    While the exact number of United Kingdom citizensj of Asian origin in Uganda is not known, it is expected that about75$ of those required to leave Uganda will be United kingdom citizens.    If our worst fears are realised this could involve ademand for 5*000 vouchers in the first 6 months.U.    We have no definite information as to when the Ugandalegislation is likely to be introduced, but we have been told thata Government Yi/hite Paper on the Africanisation policy is at presentwith the printers and it is quite likely that the White Paper andthe legislation will appear together.   The legislation is likelyto be passed through all its stages in the Uganda Parliament very rapidly and come into effect immediately.   Recent developments have indicated that the Uganda Government may   be trying to bringthe matter to a head in a way less embarrassing to themselves.Their Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote to our High commissioner in Kampala on 6 December in the context of a consular protectioncase involving a U.K. citizen of Asian origin, and in his letter,asked for assurances on the full aclmissibility to the UnitedKingdom of all Asian U.K. citizens resident in Uganda.   Thealternative, he suggested, would be to gazette them all asrefugees.   Within a few hours of the delivery of this letter,the Minister of Internal Affairs made a public statement to thesame effect.   We feel that this new tactic may be intended eitherto remove the need for legislation of the type described above(since it could be held that refugees are not entitled to permanent residence and that they would have to apply for work permits) orto provide the Uganda Government with a ready-made excuse for introducing the legislation at once.    No reply has yet been sentto this part of the letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs.Scope for Diplomatic Action5 (a) KenyaWe should clearly make strong representations to the Kenya government emphasising that we have already made provision to absorb a substantial number of Asian U.K. citizens expelled from kenya; that our capacity to absorb is already fully stretched, sothat an additional influx of the order envisaged would be bound to add greatly to the problems of the existing immigrant community in britain; and that precipitate action on the Kenya Governments
part in planning to terminate the work permits at an increasingrate presents H.M.G. with serious difficulties.     While even anindirect threat regarding a possible effect on our aid to Kenyais out of the question it could he pointed out to the Kenyansthat creating difficulties for H.M.G. is a poor return for the considerable effort Britain is making to assist Kenya&apos;sdevelopment and that there may well he a strong public reaction to the idea that while H.M.G. gives substantial support to the kenya economy the Kenya Government itself deliberately followspolicy of expelling U.K. citizens in such a way as to causeself-inflicted harm to that same economy.Later in this paper we discuss the possibility ofenlarging the quota of special vouchers and this might offer some scope for barbaimng with the Kenyans.      However, norepresentations can he expected to reduce the problem to amagnitude we would consider satisfactory.It is considered that the most effective way of making representations would be to raise the matter bilaterally withthe Kenya representative at the Prime Minister&apos;s Meeting.     Iftnis course is approved, the High Commissioner would heinstructed to inform the Kenyan Government that we would wishto discuss the matter further in this way.- 3 -
(d) india the introduction of the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill inFebruary 1968 aroused hitter criticism in India and this was maintained after the Bill had &quot;been enacted.    The new legislation was seeh hy the Indian Government and Parliament as racialistin intent and an attempt on the part of the U.K. Government torenege on their obligations to their own citizens.    To emphasisetheir disapproval they purported to close their doors to U.K.citizens of Indian origin resident in Kenya who   had hithertoenjoyed the right of free entry into India for settlement.However, this restrictive action soon exposed the indian government to hostile domestic criticism on &quot;kith and kin&quot;grounds.   After informal discussions at official level in new Delhi the Indian Government intimated that they would he prepared to admit for settlement such Asians as were forced toleave Kenya, and who wished to settle in India, provided thatthis would involve no dilution of our ultimate responsibilityfor those who were U.K. citizens.   An informal understandingwas reached in July 1968 as a result of which so far about1,000 such individuals, including dependants, have secured theright to entry into India for settlement.In the situation which is likely to develop in 1969* asregards Kenya Asians, it is very much in our interest that this understanding should continue to operate.    The question is whether,in view of the much greater numbers who will he obliged to leaveKenya than was envisaged last July, the Indians will he willingfor it to do so.   They are likely to he sensitive to the &quot;kith &apos;and kin&quot; argument as they were before, but their attention islikely even more keenly to focus on our performance in continuing to honour what they regard as our obligations to U.K. citizens.Here the Indians attach particular importance to what mr. Callaghan said towards the end of the debate on 28th February(Hansard Col. 1501) about having to take &quot;..... a man who wasthrown out of work and ejected from the country .....&quot;.Any impression that the United Kingdom Government was seeking to evade its responsibilities might,&apos;well result in the indians repudiating the informal understanding of last July anda consequent intensification of the problem as far as numberscoming to the U.K. are concerned.   Until there is some indication that the Indians are having second thoughts there is no need to seek reassurance from them which might have the effect of arousingtheir anxiety and prompting them to review their commitment.    Itmay he necessary to clo so at a later stage and particularly ifnumbers build up significantlyo    Since the Indians are no doubtaware of Kenyan, and are certainly aware of Ugandan intentions,we shall wish to keep under careful consideration the questionof if an when we should take the initiative in discussing the implications.    The Indian restrictions on entry apply at present only to those coming from Kenya, hut these restrictions would almost certainly be extended to cover those coming from Ugandaif and when the impending legislation is passed.    When the presentunderstandings/as being negotiated, the Indians said that if otherZEast African/ countries became involved &quot;surely, we could simplyamend our letters of understanding&quot;.- U -
(c) UgandaThe scope for diplomatic action in Kampala is very limited.The combination of the fact that we do not yet have public knowledge of their intentions and the recent demand from theUganda Government for an assurance that all Asian United kingdom citizens may enter this country unconditionally at any time thatthey are required to leave Uganda, makes it highly probable thatany approach by the High Commissioner in Kampala seeking to influence Uganda policy before it has been declared would make matters worse.It is considered that the most effective way of discussingtnis matter with the Ugandans would be for Ministers to raise thematter bilaterally with President Ohote or his representativeduring the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.    If this course is approved the High Commissioner would be instructed to inform the UgandanGovernment that we would wish tc discuss this matter in this way.(d) Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; MeetingWhile a general discussion on Citizenship and Migrationappears i. ow to be out of the question In view of the opposition of several Heads of Government including Presidents Kenyatta andObote, to the inscription of this item on the agenda, there wouldbe nothing to prevent us from raising this aspect of the probleminformally.   Possible courses of action open to us include:(i) Bilateral discussions with the Kenyan Ministerattending and also with President Obote or his representative, see sub paras, (a) and (c) above.(ii) A discussion of our problems with Old commonwealth representatives with a view to ascertaining the extentto which they might be prepared to co-operate In response-settling U.K. citizens of Asian origin from kenya and Uganda.(iii) Action designed to bring pressure upon Kenya and uganda from the countries which provide the bulkof our immigrants.    This might take the form ofpointing out to them that if there were a large and continuing influx of U.K, citizens from EastAfrica we might have to consider makingproportionate reductions in the immigration of commonwealth citizens-
I   (eV AidIn considering ways in which the policies of developing commonwealth countries conflict with ours or cause us embarrassment,it is inevitable that the large subventions of aid which theUnited Kingdom Government gives these countries should beOuestioned.   We consider it would be wrong to use the threat of withdrawing aid in an attempt to influence what is clearlydomestic policy arrived at in the exercise of national sovereignty.Apart from the unpleasant consequences which would arise in ourrelations with Kenya and Uganda, such action would throw doubt upon our whole aid policy, which is conducted on the principle that noconditions are attached to our grants.   As far as Kenya is concerned,we stand to lose valuable military facilities, overflying andstaging facilities, our commercial interests are considerable, andmost of all, we should antagonise the emergent African Governmentwhose views on African policies are more moderate and predictablethan most if not all others.   A denial or reduction of aid wouldhave serious consequences for the substantial number of EuropeanU.K. settlers who have not yet disposed of their land holdings,and for the United Kingdom firms still operating in Kenya.    in uganda, our trade and other commercial interests would probablysuffer disproportionately to the amount of the aid which would hesaved.Scope for Domestic:Action6i    Ministers will wish to consider what rate of immigrationfrcm East Africa should be sanctioned in 1969.    Since those concerned are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, other commonwealth Governments, especially the Government of India,vill doubtless maintain that our responsibility is not diminishedby the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968.    (in Ugandaan estimated 10,000 Asians are not citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies but British Protected Persons, and are thereforedistinguishable because they have since 1962 been subject x,o ourimmigration control.    But in practice the Uganda Government canbe expected to regard British Protected Persons as equally our responsibility, as the Kenya Government has already done).7&apos;    As mentioned in paragraph h/(&apos;b) above, the Government ofIndia will be keen to detect any tendency on our part to evadeour responsibility and in particular will place weight on thefter &quot;East Africa&quot; amend comma to full stop and insert the following^/t is possible to interpret that &quot;pledge&quot;  literally, as meaning only thate should have to take people actually ejected from East Africa, hut not .that the Kenya Government would not set about a programme ofexpulsion to force our hands.   But we have been advised that thepresence of a work permit holder becomes illegal on expiry ofthe permit.    (He might get a visitor&apos;s pass to enable him to stay for 3 to 6 months, but during this period he would presumablybe using up his savings).   Moreover, such a course could only be sustained if we were prepared tc see United Kingdom passportholders left destitute in East Africa.    It is relevant that,- 6 -
(e) AidIn considering ways in which the policies of developing commonwealth countries conflict with curs or cause us embarrassment;,it is inevitable that the large subventions of aid which theL-nited Kingdom Government gives these countries should be questioned.   We consider it would be wrong to use the threat of withdrawing aid in an attempt to influence what is clearlydomestic policy arrived at in the exercise of national sovereignty.Apart from the unpleasant consequences which would arise in ourrelations with Kenya and Uganda, such action would threw doubt uponcur whole aid policy, which is conducted on the principle that noconditions are attached to our grants.

A denial or reduction of aid wouldhave serious consequences for the substantial number of EuropeanII, K. settlers who have not yet disposed of their land holdings,and for the United Kingdom firms still operating in Kenya.    in uganda, our trade and other commercial interests would probablysuffer disproportionately to the amount of the aid which would be saved.Scope for boniestic Actiond.    Ministers will wish to consider what rate of immigration from East Africa should be sanctioned in 1969.    Since those concerned are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, etherCommonwealth Governments, especially the Government of India,sill doubtless maintain that our responsibility is not diminishedby the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968.    (in Ugandaan estimated 10,000 Asians are not citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies but British Protected Persons, and are thereforedistinguishable because they have since 1962 been subject to ourimmigration control.    But in practice the Uganda Government cante expected to regard British Protected Persons as equally our responsibility, as the Kenya Government has already done).7*    As mentioned in paragraph h&apos;(&apos;b) above, the Government ofIndia will be keen to detect any tendency on our part to evadeour responsibility and in particular will place weight on the&apos;atement during the debate on 28th February that the Unitedhgdom would have to take anyone thrown out of work and ejected!Qm East Africa^, but not those who might become unemployed byie withdrawa]. of work permits but who are not forbidden to stayire.   On this basis we would continue to refuse to acceptimigrants unless they had qualified for a special voucher or-itry certificate according to our criteria of need; in the hopethat the Kenya Government would not set about a programme ofexpulsion to force our hands.    But we have been advised that thepresence of a work permit holder becomes illegal on expiry ofthe permit.    (He might get a visitor&apos;s pass to enable him to stay for 3 to 6 months, but during this period he would presumablybe using up his savings).   Moreover,  such a course could only be sustained if we were prepared to see United Kingdom passportholders left destitute in East Africa.    It is relevant that,- 6 -
Isuring the debate on 28th February, the Home Secretary indicated(agreement with the view expressed by Mr. James Griffiths that wejjcould not &quot;sit down in comfort without taking action if, duringithe next few months, thousands of Indians, who are UnitediKingficm citizens like ourselves, became jobless and had noft income of any kind.&quot;    It is also a consideration that it mightfjjbe more to our advantage, if we are likely to have to take theseIpeople in the end,  to admit them while they still have someiresources.8.    The Home Secretary made it clear in the debate that the 1968Act was an attempt to control the situation which depended in party on the reaction of other Governments; it was acknowledged that theI Ac t could be &quot;swamped&quot; by the reaction of others, in which caseour attempt to get a civilised solution would have failed.9.   But while it may be hard for us to argue for a narrowinterpretation of the &quot;pledge&quot; , it will be equally difficult to concede openly that it requires us to accept any United Kingdompassport holders left without means of employment in East Africa.This would encourage other Governments to take an increasinglyirresponsible attitude, and numbers would be uncontrollable.    Inany further moves it therefore seems desirable to avoid gettingdrawn into argument about the precise meaning of the &quot;pledge&quot;.10.  Against this background the possibilities open seem to be:-(a) to maintain that 1,500 remains the maximum number of heads of families we are prepared to admit.    This mightdeter the East African Governments from pushing ahead with Africanisation as rapidly as they propose; but itseems more likely to provoke an intransigent reaction in hast Africa and make the Indians less helpful;(b) to maintain that the basic allocation of 1,500 willremain unchanged, but to provide a supplementaryallocation to meet cases of hardship (which could hardly exceed the original allocation in size if this approach was to carry any conviction).   The difficulty about this is that the original allocation is alreadybased on hardship,  and the distinction between the&quot;basic&quot; and the supplementary&apos;&apos; allocation would beartificial.    This would merely be a not-very-well-concealed method of increasing the total allocation:(c) to waive any ceiling on the number of vouchers, on theground that, within the narrow criteria of need we arealready applying, we are prepared to accept as manycases as arise.    This would imply that we had confidence that the numbers would not be unlimited, because wecould maintain our own criteria.   But it would rapidlybe seen as a waiving of any effective control, and would leave the other governments with a free hand to force the pace:
(d)  to increase the allocation of vouchers to take accountof the revised situation.    This would demonstrate aflexible approach on our part, in accordance with our original declared intention of not imposing a rigidlimit.   Provided the increase was large enough toindicate a realistic appreciation of the othergovernments&apos;  intentions, it should also give us areasonable basis for asking for some reciprocalattitude of restraint on their part.    In particular,the Indian Government are more likely to be ready toplay a helpful part on this basis than they would beto accept people expelled from East Africa.11. Of these approaches, (d) seems the most likely to be effective if it is adopted, the two issues to be settled ares-(i) by how much should the allocation be raised; and(ii) should any compensating reduction in the allocation of ordinary employment vouchers be looked for?is background to this, the present rate of controlled admissionunder the two schemes is:-(i) Employment voucher schemeMalta 1,000Dependent territories 600Rest of Commonwealth:Category A 1,700Category B 5,2008,500(ii) Special vouchers for UnitedKingdom passport holders 1,500Total,  (i) and (ii) 10,000At present the issue of employment vouchers results in the admission of about 5*000 heads of households, as there is aconsiderable wastage.    There is not expected to be anything likethe same wastage under the special voucher scheme.    taken together,  therefore, the two schemes account for about 6,500heads of families annually.    The total rate of settlement fromthe Commonwealth, including dependants, is between 50,000 and60,000 annually.(i) How large an increase in special vouchers?If discussions with the Kenya and Uganda Government fail toreduce the size of the problem, in 1969 we might have to expecta demand for admission from some h,500 heads of families in kenya and perhaps 5*000 in Uganda.   Admission on this scale could imply- 8 -
a possible immigration with dependants of 30,000 people.    Theproblem would not be smaller in succeeding years and similar difficulties may arise elsewhere.   Any allocation which madefull allowance for these potential numbers would amount to anabandonment of real control.    Until Uganda shows its hand wecannot openly take account of the contingent demand from there,but will have to keep something in reserve.    So far as Kenyaalone is concerned, it might be thought that 2,500 heads of households should be the limit to aim for in 1969, implying apossible intake of 7,500 with dependants.(ii) A reduction in employment vouchers?The number of Commonwealth citizens who may seek to entertne United Kingdom from East Africa may well be so large that itcould not be wholly offset even if the issue of vouchers were completely stopped.    In practice it would be difficult to do this.The other members of the Commonwealth would be likely to takeserious exception to a complete prohibition on the entry of thoseof their citizens, who wish to come here to work, in order thatAsians from East Africa may dc so.    The West Indies and the old commonwealth would be the most seriously affected.    This country&apos;aspecial obligations to Malta and the dependent territories have,moreover, been acknowledged by special allocations of employmentvouchers to them.   The situation is further complicated by the dependence of the National Health Service on doctors, and to a lesser extent nurses, from the Commonwealth for its efficientfunctioning, a position which is likely to continue for some timein the future.    It would almost certainly be necessary to make arrangements for their continued admittance; but to take onlymedical personnel might lead to accusations of &quot;creaming off&quot; theskills of the Commonwealth and could even lead to retaliatorymeasures by India which supplies the bulk of immigrant doctors.There are also other categories of British subjects (usually fromthe Old Commonwealth) whose entry is advantageous to this country.It, might not be necessary to retain an employment voucher toregulate the admission of doctors and other essential workers.- 9 -
