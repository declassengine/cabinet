The pledge to fulfil this combined social securityplan formed an important plank in our election programmes of 1964 and1966.    I now seek the cabinet approval to proposals to implement thispledge and to their publication in the form of a White Paper.    Part II ofthis memorandum summarises   the proposals, while Part III discussesthe more important features in greater detail.     Parts IV and V assessrespectively the financial and economic implications of the new scheme.2. It may be of convenience if I preface these lengthy and complexproposals for reconstructing national insurance with a brief account ofthe political and economic background against which they must be judged.3.     Firsts it should be realised that even if we were not committed asa Government to the reform of pensions the state of our national insurancesystem as modified by the Conservative Government in 1961 would compel us to undertake a radical reform.4,     The element of earnings-related contribution which they thengrafted on to the flate-rate scheme has helped to relieve the Treasury^burden.     But since the earnings-related benefit is not dynamised, thisscheme will always keep the level of national insurance pension wellbelow that of supplementary pension and so compel a substantial minority of pensioners to submit to a means test in order to obtain supplementary benefit.     Even more ser-ious the need to finance successive increases ofbenefit by jackingnap flat-rate contribution already places an intolerableburden on lower-paid workers.    Since this process cannot be taken verymuch further we are now faced with the choice either of financingpensions increasingly out of taxation or of recasting the whole structure of benefits and contributions.5.     In choosing the second alternative we can be fortified by the recognition that our own plan for earnings-related pensions has stoodthe test of time and criticism.     The two assumptions on which it was based still hold good:-1-
(a) That, whatever the merit of financing education and health outof taxes, contributions which enable the contributor to claimentitlement by right are essential to social insurance.    this principle applies equally, but in rather different wayss both to the short-term risks of unemployment and sickness and tothe long-term provision for retirement.    Real social securitycan only be achieved with real social insurance,,(b) That the test of any social security system is whether it enables the citizen in the course of his working life to acquire pension rights which make it unnecessary for him to apply to the Statefor supplementary relief.    Since the Conservative scheme was introduced the insurance principle in social security has been steadily corroded while private pensions schemes have continued to multiply.    The aim of the proposals in this paper is to create a State system of earnings-related benefitscompatible with the continued existence of a healthy private sector in the field of superannuation.6.     It is essential that contributors should be in no doubt whatsoeverthat their contributions really are contributions to an insurance fund andnot merely taxation under another name.    Inevitably, therefore, our future State pension scheme, like all the present private occupational pension   schemes, will pre-empt resources otherwise available to theChancellor for taxation.    If there is no such pre-emption then contribu-tions and taxes become indistinguishable;   the insurance principle isfurther corroded and contributors cover the costs of their contributions by putting in wage claims.    In fact, if contributions are regarded merely as taxation under another guise, it would be simpler to scrap the wholecontributory system and finance pensions, as is done in some countries,out of taxation and make our present supplementary benefit the solebenefit in a selective pension scheme.    Since, however, we reject this solution we must be prepared to accept certain rigidities in taxable capacity in order to convince contributors that the contribution theypay in week by week does finally win them a benefit related to their personal rate of contribution.7,     It is sometimes suggested that success depends on building a sound economic basis and then making sure that the presentational ftffpeeta arecorrect.    But in the case of a State pension scheme the so-calledpresentational aspects are the essence of the matter.     The main factor in making a scheme a genuine savings scheme is to convince thecontributors that it is genuine.    Indeed, their conviction that they are really saving is a major factor in making the savings real.    the extremely elaborate methods of assessing pension rights which areoutlined in the second part of this paper can only be justified, despite the administrative burden they impose, if they do persuade the working population that they are not merely paying taxes but earning week byweek entitlement to a decent pension in old age.-2-CON Fl DENTS AL
PART II - SUMMARY OF PROPOSALSRetirement pensions(!)   Contribution and benefit formula8.     Both contributions and benefits for employees will reflectearnings up to a ceiling which should be set and maintained at aboutl\ times national average earnings (about  1,700 a year or about 33 a week in 1968 values).    The initial rate of contribution should be-f per cent for employees, including the National Health Service andIndustrial Injuries elements; the corresponding employerrs contribution would be b\ per cent plus his contribution to the Redundancy Fund (atpresent equivalent to about \ per cent), on the assumption that the employer^ percentage will be assessed on his whole payroll, although this question has still to be settled.    Some adjustment to the employers&apos;contribution would be needed if responsibility for the early weeks of sickness is transferred to them.9.      Pensions would be based on earnings averaged over a wholeworking life, each yearrs earnings being revalued in line with increases in national average earnings.    The rate of pension will be calculatedaccording to a formula which will divide reckonable earnings into twobands, of which the lower band will carry a preferential rate of benefitreturn.    It is proposed that the formula should give a pension of60 per cent of a claimant^ average reckonable earnings up to a pointequal to half the national average earnings (i. e. up to   11 a week in1968 values) and 25 per cent thereafter up to the ceiling of lj timesnational average earnings.10.     The following table shows at various levels of earnings whatreductions or increases the proposed contributions would entail formale  employees as compared with their current contribution - that is.,on the notional assumption that the scheme had been introduced thisyear - comp?red with their eventual pension entitlement at presentearnings levels.:-3-

To theextent that we can finance such upratings by increasing the present graduated contributions, we should mitigate the increases or reductions that will benecessary at the point of time at which the new scheme is introduced.^Additionally, benefit accrues in respect of the present graduated contribution; itwould, however, be misleading to include this element in comparing rates ofpension obtainable under the present and the new schemes, since the graduatedelement under the present scheme is undynamised and will steadly lose its value.Assuming average earnings of the amount stated.-4-
(2)   Exchequer contribution and National Health Service contribution11,    A contribution to the National Health Service should continue to be collected along with the National Insurance contribution to raise for the health Service approximately the same amount of money as does thepresent flat-rate Health Service contribution, but it should in future be shared equally between employer and employee and would represent about\ per cent a side out of the contribution precentages proposed above.We should retain an Exchequer contribution to National Insurance benefits,bearing the same proportionate relationship (about 16 per cent) as atpresent to the income of the National Insurance Funds (other thaninterest income).(3)    PejllipiL^^-?:-^ J^JiL^2^i^-S.2^4.i^i2Jl12.    Minimum pension age will remain at 65 for men and 60 for women,and during the ensuing five years title to pension will, as now, be conditional upon retirement and subject to an earnings rule, withincrements payable for deferred retirement.(4)   Maturity13,    The scheme will mature over a twenty-year period.    Awards inthe transitional period will show a gradual progression from the old-scheme to the new-scheme benefit rates.(5) -^YB^BlhSIB14.     We should undertake in the White Paper to review benefit ratesin the light of specified general factors (such as the movement of prices and earnings and the economic situation), but shotild undertake noabsolute commitment beyond at least inflation proofing on each occasion.If our commitment is limited in this way, however, we should promise to review pension rates annually; we should alsoa in presenting theschemed finances, show that the contribution rates proposed are capable of accommodating increases in benefit rates in line with themovement of earnings (&quot;earnings dynamism&quot;).(6)   Contrjacjdng-out15.     Complete contracting-out of the new scheme pensions would not be feasible and any facility for contracting-out would have to take the formof partial &quot;abatement&quot;, whereby the percentage of earnings paid bymembers of approved occupational schemes and their employers wouldbe reduced with a related reduction in the employees  State pension which the employer would undertake to make good from his occupational scheme.(7)   ^ eiejLvaticm of pensions16.     The legislation should include provision for preservation ofpension rights in occupational schemes on change of employment, subjectto an option whereby employees could retain their present right to with-draw their contributions instead.-5-
CONFIDENTIAL ....-....45Widows17,    The present structure of widows&apos; allowances during the first sixmonths of widowhood, followed by either widowed mothers&apos; allowances to widows with dependent children or widows&apos; pensions, will becontinued except that some widows1 pension would be payable to womenwidowed over 40 instead of the present all or nothing age 50 rule.    Thewidowfs allowance will be calculated similarly to other short-term benefits, but based on the husband!s earnings I widowed mother&apos;allowance and widow&apos;s pension will be calculated by applying the retirement pension formula to the husbandfs life record of earnings,filled in with credits if necessary for the years until he would havereached age 65.     A widowed mother will also receive flat-rate increases for her dependent children.    Contributions paid after widowhood but before age 60 will enable a widow to qualify at that age for retirement pension at a higher rate than her previous widow&apos;s benefit.    A womanwidowed between ?.ges 40 and 49 without dependent children will get ft pensionsimilarly based on her husband s record, but scaled down by referenceto her age at widowhood or when she ceased to have dependent children(if later), subject to a minimum pension of  1. 10s.     The benefit payable to a woman widowed under 5 0 will continue when she reaches retirementage, augmented by any pension earned by her post-widowhood contribu-tions.    She would be allowed in the alternative (where this gave a betterresult) to build up her record for retirement pension purposes by taking over her husband s record for the years up to widowhood and relying on her own thereafter.^arrie^ women18.    Married women will continue to qualify for a flate-rate pension on their husband&apos;s records (at the rate then payable under the flat^ratescheme - at present  2. 16s. a week) and will receive an additionrelated to their own earnings, if any, at the upper band rate] alternatively,where this gives a better result, they may qualify for a pension solely ontheir own record.    The present contribution option for working wives and windows will be abolished,19.     Discussions with both sides of industry will be necessary beforethe details of these benefits can be finally settled.     As with the presentearnings-related supplements to sickness and unemployment benefits,however, the new benefits will be related to earnings in the previous taxyear.    Sickness and unemployment benefits will continue for six monthsat the full rate.     In the case of sickness, this will be followed by a newlong-term benefit, calculated in a similar way to retirement pension, withcredits given for the remaining period up to pension age.    Unemploymentbenefit will continue for a further six months at the old scheme standardflat rate.20.     The White Paper should, however, indicate that there will be anattendance allowance for the very severely disabled (including the wivesof insured persons) to be financed from the national insurance contribution,but that the amount and precise scope of the allowance and the questionwhether it should operate in advance of the new scheme cannot be deter-mined until the results of a current survey are available.
A separate National Superannuation Fund21.     In order to mark the distinction between the new earnings-relatedpension and other national insurance benefits which are in the nature ofaccident insurance, retirement and widows&apos; pensions should be financedthrough a separate National Superannuation Fund, the other benefits beingfinanced from a Social Insurance Fund.Other features22,    Sel^-em^loyed.    Since it has not been found practicable for the self-employed to pay earnings-related contributions, they will pay flat-rate contributions counting for pension at an appropriate point on the employed personls earnings scale, probably at half average earnings - 11 a week in current terms.    The amount of the contribution will be broadly the same as that paid jointly be employees and their employers for the same amount of pension, but arrangements will be made to exclude the lowest paid self-employed from compulsory liability,,23.    Non-employed,    Contributions will be voluntary for the non-employed (and for employed people with earnings below the PA YE limit)up to a &quot;standard&quot; level each year, which will correspond to the old-scheme standard rate pension.    Employed and self-employed people with an earningc record for any year below the standard level will alsobe able to contribute voluntarily up to this level each year.Credits.    Contributors will be credited with earnings at a flat-rate, equal to half national average earnings, during periods of sickness and unemployment (except that they will be limited to an individual^reckonable earnings where these were below that level, and contributions and credits together will not operate to take anyone 5s reckonable earnings above the schemets ceiling in any year).
PART III -  AWWJtWkrURES OF THE NEW SOffEME     4(1)   Level-ciJ:h^contrlj^ion and pension formula25,    The new pension scheme must be financed basically on pay-as-you-go principles but, if too frequent increases in contribution rates are to be avoided, the initial level of contributions must be set rather higher than would strictly be required by the initial level of expenditureafter taking account of the Exchequer contribution and investment income.Apart from this necessity it will be important that the new scheme shouldgain general acceptance as equitable by the middle and higher wage earners who will receive a lower marginal return by way of pension onthe upper band of their reckonable earnings than that given on the lowerband.    We must, therefore, avoid too steep an increase at the outsetin the level cf contribution which they have to pay.    On the other hand,while the lower paid worker must be given some reduction in order to relieve him of the excessive burden of the present flat-rate contribution,we must not lower his contribution so far below its present level as to invite complaint from existing pensioners and pressure for improvementin their pensions to match those obtainable for a lower rate of contribution by contributors to the new scheme,26.     Similarly, in regard to the pension formula, while we mustadhere to our primary objective of raising the level of future pensions forall but the lowest wage earners progressively above the supplementary benefit level (which necessarily involves a two-banded formula offering a preferential return on the lower tranche of earnings, if the scheme isnot to be unduly costly and to result in over-pensioning of the higher paid), we must also as far as possible seek to offer the middle and higher paid contributor a return which will be regarded by him as fair.Alternative formulae can be devised offering different pension returns upto different levels of earnings.    But within the fairly narrow limits set by the above considerations the variation in the amount of pension givenby the different formulae must be smaller at the upper than at the lowerend of the earnings scale where it would have a disproportionate impact on the standard of living without yielding an improvement for the higher paid sufficient to influence his attitude to the scheme, *    We must recognisthat a substantial element of redistribution in the pension formula is needed if the scheme is satisfactorily to fulfil its primary object, and*Consider, for example, the pension given by two alternative formulaeproviding a pension of (a) 60 per cent of reckonable earnings up to\ national average earnings plus 25 per cent of reckonable earnings above that level up to a ceiling of if times average earnings and (b)55 per cent of reckonable earnings up to \ average earnings plus27f per cent on earnings between \ and \\ times average earningsReckonableearnings 11 (half average earnings) 22 (average earnings) 33 (ceiling) or morePension under;-	(a) 60/25% formula	(b) 55/27^% formula 6  12s,  9    7s.  12    2s.	 6   Is.  9   Is.    6d.  12   2s.Thus, as compared with formula (a), formula (b) would give the  11 aweek earner 11s, less and the  33 a week earner the same.

*As given by the figure of the average earnings of adult male manual workers in manufacturing industries and certain non-manufacturing industries and services, obtained in the Department of employment and Productivity^ half-yearly enquiry.    The latest available figure(for April 1968) is  22. 5s. a week./&quot;Th is question has still to be considered against the possibility thatSelective Employment Tax as a payroll tax may have to be collected&apos; in association with the employer&apos;s national insurance contributionwhen the earnings-related scheme is introduced, since a decision to dispense with a ceiling would have implications for that tax.     Therewould, however, be considerable administrative advantages in calculating both the employer&apos;s contribution and SET as a percentageof the gross pay of all employees within the PAYE system, as recorded on their tax deduction documents without applying an earningsceiling.    But if there is no ceiling, the total payments which employers will have to make to the national insurance scheme willthereby be increased, and for that reason it is proposed that theirpercentage contribution to the national insurance scheme should bea 4 per cent less than that paid by employees, although their total contribution, including the Redundancy Fund contribution, will be identical with, or close to, the employee*s.    A further adjustment to the employer^ contribution would also be required if we were todecide to transfer to employers responsibility for the early weeks of sickness; this possibility is currently under discussion with the tuc and the CBI, but will require very close consideration.-9-that the adoption of a two-banded formula itself makes it impossible tooffer a marginal return on the upper band of earnings which will of itself fully satisfy the higher paid.    The main attraction for thelatter will lie in the prospect of post-award dynamism with acceleratedmaturity, the provision for wife/widow, and a firm foundation forfurther saving with preservation of occupational pension rights onchange of employment.27,     On balance of considerations, it is proposed that the pensionformula should give a pension of 60 per cent of reckonable earnings up to about half average earnings plus 25 per cent of earnings above that level up to a ceiling of about l\ times average earnings.    It isalso proposed that the level of the total contribution should initiallybe set at 6f per cent a side for employees up to a ceiling of about\\ times national average earnings. *    On the employees8 side thiswould include his contribution for all national insurance benefits,including Industrial Injuries and the National Health Service contribution,as proposed below.    on the employer&apos;s side we should chargebj per cent for National Insurance, National Health Service andIndustrial Injuries, the element for National Insurance being \ per centless than that of the employee.    This, however, is on the assumptionthat the employerls contribution would be paid as a percentage of allearnings without a ceiling, L e. as a percentage of his total payroll,although this is a question which has still to be settled^;   in addition,the employer would pay his contribution to the Redundancy Fund, atpresent equivalent to \ per cent, which would make his total percentagecontribution the same as, or close to, the employeefs 6f per cent.
28.      The table in paragraph 10 above sets out the total contributions thatwould be payable at present earnings1 levels by employees together with the eventual new scheme pension for which they would qualify on theseproposals.    It compares the contribution increases or decreases in cashterms with the present rate of contributions; since it is not possible to predict what will be the level of the existing scheme contribution on the eve of the introduction of the new scheme - before then we shall probablyincrease national insurance benefits twice.    Even if benefits are increased in 1969 only in line with prices and in 1971 only in line with earningsincreases since 1969, benefit costs, and therefore the general level ofcontributions needed to sustain them, will have to increase faster thanearnings because of the growth in the number of pensioners.    If the contribution increases are confined to the flat rate, the contribution for employed men and their employers might need to go up by about 4s. a side,which would fa.ll particularly heavily on those with low or modest earnings.However, there would be strong advantage in financing upratings in the interim, at least partly, by increasing the existing graduated contribution,as may be politically possible once the White Paper on the new scheme is published.    Apart from mitigating the weight of flat-rate contribution onthe lower paid in the interim, this would also bring the existing schemecontribution structure rather nearer to that of the new scheme and sosoften the impact of the contribution changes of the new scheme, especially on those with earnings above the average,29.    As indicated in table 1 in Part 17 of this memorandum, with a contribution of 6f- per cent a side as proposed and a pension formulagiving a 60/25 per cent return on reckonable earnings, the income ofthe Fund might be expected to continue to exceed its outgo for abouteleven years on the other assumptions there set out.     As explained inparagraph 37 below, it has been assumed for illustrative purposes inthis table that benefits will be increased biennially after award in line with the movement of earnings ([rpost--award earnings -dynamism&apos;.&apos;).The actual period during which the scheme would in practice remain insurplus could be substantially affected if experience diverges from the assumptions cn which the financial forecasts in Part IV are based - forexample, in relation to the degree of dynamism actually given, to thenumbers contracted-out, to the effect on sickness benefit claims of abolishing the married woman&apos;s option? and to the extent to whichcontributions are paid voluntarily by those entitled to pay them.    Thefigures would also be affected if it were decided to maintain the married woman&apos;s option.(2)  TheJExchequer supplement and the NaUcg^jIe^ljth^Servicecontribution30.     At present the Exchequer supplements the contributions ofinsured people and employers towards the cost of the national insurance and industrial injuries schemes.    The Exchequer contributions to those schemes are running at about  360 million a year or nearly .16 per cent of the income of the National Insurance Fund other than interest.    Thepresent size of the Exchequer supplement is more a matter of historicalaccident than a reflection of long-standing principle, but an exchequer contribution has always been a f^atu^e of national insurance and theLabour Movement would regard the continuance of a substantialExchequer payment as a matter of principle.    But the supplement willalso serve a useful presentational purpose in support of the insuranceprinciple, since it can be used to justify the incorporation in an insurance scheme of redistributive features, such as early maturity-10-
and weighting of benefit in favour of those with dependants and of thelowly paid.    Alternatively and increasingly as time went on, it couldbe presented as helping to finance the real improvement of the benefits of old scheme pensioners so that the cost of these does not fall entirely on the new earnings-related contribution.    This is an aspect to whichthe TUC attach major importance and my colleagues will recall thatone of our main criticisms of the Tory graded pension scheme in 1959was that the earnings-related contributions were devoted to payment ofexisting pensions and that the Exchequer was in consequence relieved of its responsibilities to the National Insurance scheme at the expenseof the contributor.     There is thus a strong political and presentation!case for retaining an Exchequer supplement bearing the same pro-portionate relationship to the Fund!s contribution income as it does atpresent.     However, this matter has to be considered along with thefuture of the National Health Service contribution.31.     The present flat-rate National Health Service contribution iscollected as part of the weekly stamp.    For a man, the employer pays8d. a week and the employee 3s. 2d.    The yield is about  180 million a year (L e. about half the amount of the pre sent Exchequer supplementThis money is hypothecated to the cost of running the National health service, thereby reducing the amount tc be found from other taxation.If euch a contribution were to be retained along with the new earnings-related contribution, it too must for practical reasons be earnings-related^ and would absorb, at its present level, about \ per cent a sideout of the contribution of bjj per cent a side, which I have suggested above is the maximum total contribution whicn we should seek to irripos32.     It can be argued that the National Health Service contributionfinances a relatively small part of that Service and that its association with the National Insurance contribution has always been somewhatanomalous and a source of misunderstanding about the finances of the health Service,     It can also be argued that it would be difficult topresent an earnings-related Health Service contribution as in any sense an insurance contribution towards Health Service benefits, andits collection, as a tax, along with the National Insurance contribution,might prejudice the extent to which the latter is regarded as a genuineinsurance contribution with an element of saving.    Its abolition would lead to some simplification ot accounting procedures,33.     On the other hand the National Health Service contribution onan earnings-related basis would provide a built-in dynamic source of income which would help finance expansion of that Service or offer itsome protection at any time when Government expenditure was beingcut back.    Further, to the extent   that it relieves the Exchequei of itsliability for that Service and reduces the proportion of the totalemployee^ contribution which is attributable to pension, it both makesroom for a higher Exchequer supplement to be paid to the national insurance Fund and enables the contributor to be given better value for money for the pension element in his contribution.    The higher theExchequer eontribution, the more convincingly can it be presented asfulfilling the functions suggested in pas-agsraph 30 above.-11-
34.    The balance of advantage seems to lie strongly in favour of retaining at about their present levels both the Exchequer contribution and the National Health Service contribution (though on an earnings -related basis and shared equally between employer and employee).It is therefore proposed that the Exchequer contribution should continueto represent about 16 per cent of the contribution income of the national insurance Fund and that a contribution of \ per cent a side from employers and employees should be included in the total contribution of6-f per cent a side proposed above.(3)    Post-awardjivjiarni^rn35.     We are committed, as a minimum, to &quot;inflation proof ing &quot; or price-dynamism, that is, to regular increases in existing and new-scheme pensions at least in step with increases in prices.    But pension under the present scheme have, as a matter of history, been given avery much greater degree of dynamism and have for many yearsincreased rather faster than earnings so that pensioners have been accorded a greater improvement in their living standards than theworking population - between October, 1951 and October, 1967 benefitrates increased by 200 per cent compared with an increase of 157 percent in earnings and of 67.5 per cent in prices, the increase in thereal value of benefits thus averaging 3. 8 per cent per annum.    Thesame degree of post-award dynamism must apply to both old schemeand new scheme pensioners.    Unless therefore it can offer something more than price-dynamism the new scheme would stand condemnedfrom the start as offering existing pensioners in particular a worseprospect than past experience will have led them to expect.    The TUChave expressed deep concern that, whereas the new scheme offers a prospect to its contributors of a steady improvement in pension levelswhich will carry all but the lowest earners above supplementary benefitlevel, it has nothing comparable to offer existing pensioners.    Andthey have not been slow to point out that, if post-award dynamism isbelow earnings-dynamism, the disparity between existing pensioners and new-scheme pensioners will become still greater, since the new-scheme contributions of the latter will be revalued for pensionpurposes in line with the movement of earnings -&quot;pre-award dynamism&quot;,36,    However, it must be recognised that no Chancellor of theExchequer would wish to accept an unqualified commitment that benefits should be increased on each and every occasion in line with the increasein earnings irrespective of the economic situation.    In presenting ourscheme in the White Paper, therefore, it is proposed that we should undertake to review benefit rates in the light of specified general factors(such as the movement of prices and earnings and the economic situation),but with no absolute commitment beyond at least inflation proofing on each occasion.     If our commitment is limited to inflation proofing, however,and If the new scheme is to be made acceptable to existing pensioners,we should, despite the drawbacks of such a course, promise annual reviews so that pension rates will not lose their purchasing power asindicated by the new pensioner index now being prepared.    It will alsobe essential, if we are to meet the TUC points and if the scheme is notto appear to worsen the prospects of existing pensioners, that we shoulddemonstrate that its finances are capable at least of accommodatingearnings dynamism.    There is, however, difficulty in postulating any&quot;* 12 &quot;*
particular rate of increase in prices and earnings, and it is therefore proposed that the schemers future income and outgo should be illustratedin the White Paper at constant prices and earnings.    This basis wouldgive rates of contribution which, broadly, would be appropriate to fullpre- and post-award earnings-dynamism at whatever rate earnings may increase in future,37.     Similarly, for the purpose of illustrating to our colleagues thepossible cost of the proposals, it has, in view of past history, seemedno more than realistic to base the forecast in Part IV of this memorandumon the assumption that, over the years, benefits will in practice bedynamised in line with earnings.    For this purpose, the same assump-tions have been adopted as for the Public Expenditure forecasts,i, e, constant prices and an increase in real earnings of 3 per cent ayear, with biennial increases in pension rates.    It is hardly possibleto make any meaningful comparison with the possible future growth ofexpenditure on benefits if the existing scheme had continued since thepresent contribution structure will not much longer be tenable - as already noted we shall probably have to increase the present gradedcontribution to finance increases in flat-rate benefits in the period before the new scheme is introduced - but if the benefits of the present scheme were to be dynamised in the future to the same degree as theyhave been since 1951 (&quot;historic dynamism&quot;) the cost of that scheme wouldup to 1990 have exceeded the present cost of the new scheme given inPart IV on the assumption of post-award earnings - dynamism.(4)   Contributions for married women38.     The question whether working wives should continue to beallowed to choose whether to pay contributions is a difficult one.Married women have been able to opt out of contributions liability since1948, and this right has been widely and increasingly used.    A change to compulsory liability is likely to be unpopular among many women,especially the higher earners for whom the sudden contributionincrease would be heavy.     The effect on the willingness of marriedwomen to remain in or to enter, employment is very hard to assess.It hardly seems likely, however, that any substantial number of women in employment will give up work completely when the new schemebegins (especially as those with earnings below  5. 5s, a week willnot become liable for a new-scheme contribution).    Single women whomarry after the new scheme begins will simply continue to pay the samecontribution on a given level of earnings as they did before.    As for married women,, considering whether to re-enter employment, thereare many factors likely to be influencing a woman&apos;s decision besides the level of the statutory deductions from her pay.    Married women would also become compulsorily insured for short-term, unemployment and sickness benefit and this would not only intensify the already difficult problems of controlling married womenJs claims to these benefits but would increase the cost of them by some  75 million a year at the start of the new scheme.    (However, the extra expenditure on benefits for married women on their own insurance would for a good many years beoutweighed by the additional contributions paid by the women concerned. )-13-CO N FIDE NTS AL
39.     Not to include married women in the new scheme on a compulsory-basis would, however, run counter to the general insurance principleof universal cover.    Once the present heavy flat-rate contributions arereplaced by fully earnings-related contributions (except for the self-employed) working wives, whether high or low earners, can afford topay contributions on the same basis as everyone else.    The pensionproposals for married women will ensure that a wife gets a return forher own contributions8 in addition to her pension on her husband&apos;sinsurance, as she does not do at present.     Indeed, ending the optionwill mean that more and more married women will be able to &quot;stand ontheir own feet&quot; for pension purposes and build up a substantial enfcifcle-ment on their own records which is independent of their rights on theirhusband&apos;s insurance.    There will also be substantial administrativesavings for employers, the Inland Revenue and the Ministry of social security if all women are treated alike for contribution purposes.40.     On balance it seems appropriate that married women should berequired to pay contributions xpxd&amp;n the new scheme on the same terms as other employees.(5)   Constant attendanc^ all cwance^41.     It will be important that the White Paper should indicate that we accept in principle the case for introducing special provision for thevery seriously disabled.    The White Paper will be promising sub-stantially improved benefits for widows and ultimately for retirement pensioners and those of the long term sick who are already provided forby sickness benefit.    Public and Parliamentary opinion is now seriouslyconcerned about the gap in our social services which results form theabsence of any special recognition of the needs which stem from seriousdisablement, other than that in the schemes fcr war and industrialpensioners.    The TUC have also made strong representations on thispoint.    We must, at a time when we are promising .other major improve-ments in other benefits, indicate that we attach at least as high a priority to the introduction of some special provision for the very seriously dis-abled.    There is at present, however, a lack of firm information aboutthe potential size of the field and hence about the cost and. the practical problems involved, and we must await the information which we expect to get next year from a survey now in hand before we can settle the scopeof the new provision, the amount of the benefit and its starting date,though it would seem appropriate that it should be financed from theinsurao.ee contribution like the other benefits.42.     The White Paper should therefore indicate that there will be anattendance allowance for the very severely disabled (including the wivesof insured persons), but that the amount and precise scope of the allowance and the question whether it should operate in advance of thenew scheme cannot be determined until we see the results of theGovernments Survey,    As an indication of its possible order of magnitudeat the outset, a figure of   15 million a year has been included in the tables in Part IV of this memorandum in respect of the cost of this allowance, although it may be expected to grow in subsequent yearsfaster than indicated by the figures which reflect only earnings-dynamismand takes no account of likely extension of the allowance itself.
(6)   A separate National Superannuation Fund43.    It is accepted that the earnings-related payments for the new scheme will have to be levied in a single operation, i. e, one mechanism(PAYE) and one deduction from pay at the end of each pay period.    Whatis by no means so clear is whether this deduction should then be paid intoa single fund financing all National Insurance benefits indiscriminately orsplit between two funds - a &quot;National Superannuation Fund&quot; for pension benefits and a separate &quot;Social Insurance Fund&quot; for benefits to meetshort-term contingencies - and this split recorded on the individuals payslip.44.     One view is that it would be v/ise to keep to a single fund.Supporters of this view advance the following reasons;-(a) Accounting and administration would be simpler both forGovernment and for employers.(b) The establishment of a single fund with a wide variety of benefits not found together in private schemes wouldmake it difficult for would-be critics to single out any individual benefit as offering a poorer return than doesa private commercial scheme,(c) Since the new scheme is bound to be financed mainly on&quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis, there can be no advantage in trying to specify the precise purposes to which individuals&apos;contributions would be applied.(d) Even if there were intensive and sustained publicity,there might be little general appreciation of the distinction between the two Funds.45.     An alternative view is that whether the contribution is splitbetween two distinct funds depends on how seriously we take the idea ofdistinguishing pensions from other forms of benefit.     Our own national superannuation scheme (involving a modest investment in equities) was of course launched as a public life insurance scheme of this kind;the short-term benefits were grafted on to the scheme later.    Thebenefits provided under the new scheme are themselves of twoessentially different kinas.    On the one hand is the retirement pensionwith which widows&apos; pensions might be associated.    Provision for retirement is of the nature of superannuation or even, perhaps, endow-ment insurance; it is akin to compulsory saving, not for a contingencywhich may, or may not, occur, but for a state which is expectedsooner or later.    On the other hand, provision against periods ofunemployment or sickness is of the nature of insurance againstaccidents.    To the man in the street conducting his own affairs s this is avery real distinction, and there would be graat advantages in encouraginghim to make this same distinction when the new scheme is presented.The more clearly it is seen, the more readily will the contributor feelhe understands the purposes of the scheme.    The greater his under-standing, the more likely he will be to welcome the scheme and to paywhat he is required to pay without suspicion or reluctance.    The moreready he is to pay, the less will the new level of contributions impingeon total taxable capacity and compete with other desirable objects ofpublic expenditure.
46,     A way to mark the distinction would be to divide the contributioninto two parts;  one to be paid into a fund financing benefits paid as amatter of &quot;accident insurance&quot; and the other to be paid into a separatefund financing &quot;superannuation&quot; and widows&apos; pensions.    The needs of the&quot;accident insurance&quot; fund would, of course, fluctuate with the level ofunemployment and the incidence of epidemics, whereas the needs of the&quot;superannuation&quot; fund would continue, or perhaps rather grow, on a steady trend.    Situations would therefore arise from time to time when one fund was threatened with a deficiency when the other was in surplus.But this fact, far from being an obstacle, could be turned to advantage,despite its disadvantage of more frequent changes in the level of contribution and some loss of flexibility.    The concept of the contributionelement for &quot;superannuation&quot; as saving for old age and widowhood wouldbe reinforced if the Government pledged itself never to divert resources from the &quot;superannuation&quot; fund in order to meet the ups and downs ofthe other fund.47.     Very roughly, within a total combined contribution of 13-1 percent, as proposed (i, e. 6f per cent a side for employer and employee),and after allowing for the Health Service, Redundancy Fund and industrial injuries elements, and assuming that the contribution for the social insurance Fund would be no more than required to finance the forecastcurrent outgo of that Fund (so that if expenditure was more thanforecast it would have to be met by increasing the contribution or byrunning down balances taken over from the existing National insurance fund) the initial joint employer/employee contribution to the national superannuation Fund might be 9 &quot;9 if per cent.    This assumes also thatthe Exchequer contribution would be dividued pro rata between the twoFunds.48.    While the adoption of a basically &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; approach to the financing of pensions to some extent weakens the argument for settingup a separate Superannuation Fund, there would still in the initial yearsand on the contribution proposed, be a limited element of funding.    Therewould seem to be a strong balance of advantage in setting up a separateSuperannuation Fund and it is therefore proposed that this should be done.In the interests of simplicity, however, the tables in Part IV of thismemorandum illustrate the finances of the new scheme on the basis ofa single Fund.-16-

51,     This section describes the main effects on the medium term development of the economy of replacing the existing national insurancescheme by the new earnings-related scheme. (1)(1)   T^-^iBJ-g-.-!^     Liyin^and^theDistribution of Income52,     The new scheme will reduce the incidence of serious povertyamong people who are off work for long periods through sickness,widowhood and retirement.    The largest section of the populationwhose standard of living will substantially improve - gradually as thescheme matures - are pensioners,    The Family Expenditure Survey-showed that, in 1966, the average income (net of direct taxes, includingdirect benefits in cash and kind) of 2-adult households whose income is mainly derived from state pensions was about  530 per annum, andof single pensioners was about  320, whereas the average incomes of non-pensioner households in 1966 was about  1,190 (2 adults) and about  65 0 (one adult).    The same survey showed that the bulk   of families with very low incomes live mainly on state pensions, (2)53,     On the extreme assumption that the whole of their income is spent on consumption and none of it saved, pensioners account atpresent (according to rough estimates) for roughly 9 per cent of consumers&apos; expenditure, whereas they form about 14 per cent of thepopulation (counting each child under 16 as half an adult).    national insurance pensions account for just over half the total income of pensioners and could therefore account for about 4-f per cent of totalconsumers&apos; expenditure.54.     These figures suggest that the proposed increases in pension rates will substantially narrow the gap between the standards of living of pensioners and of the rest of the population.    The recent and continued growth of occupational pension schemes, though likely to bereduced by the impact of the new schemes3 will help to narrow the gap;but, by comparison with occupational schemes, the new scheme would favour the less well off pensioners.(1) The conclusions depend largely on estimates and forecasts which inevitably involve a good many assumptions.    While they take account of relevant information obtained from departments, someof these assumptions, e. g. about the impact of the new scheme onoccupational pension schemes, are little better than guesses.    Theconclusions are subject to revision when more up to date figures and estimates become available.(^) See &quot;The incidence of taxes and social service benefits, particularly among households with low incomes&quot;, (Economij^Tj^jidSjJuly, 1968, Tables 1 and 3.)-20-
55,     The additional (gross) cost of all benefits under the new scheme,compared with the likely growth under the present scheme, will amountvery roughly to 1 per cent of the gross national product by 1987 and perhaps l\ per cent by 2002.    Additional (gross) expenditure on retirement pensions will amount to roughly 0. 7 per cent of the GNPby 1987 and perhaps 1. 8 per cent by 2002.    The increase in pensioners5total income (before tax) will be less than this because some of theincreased pension would partly replace occupational pensions and supplementary benefits,56.     Under the new scheme, the standard of living of pensionerswould be protected against rising prices and pensioners could alsoexpect to share in the growth of national prosperity.    occupational pension schemes do not provide full protection against rising prices and the purchasing power of pensions provided by these and other private schemes gradually declines in the vears following retirement;the faster prices rise, the more older pensioners in particularsuffer.    Thus, the new state scheme would in two respects (age and income level) lead in the long run to more equitable standards ofliving among different pensioner families than private schemes.57.     The new scheme will affect inequality in several ways.    First,earnings-related contributions (up to maximum) will spread the burden on employees more fairly than the present flat-rate (plus graduated)contributions.    Secondly, the fact that pensioners will receive higherincomes will reduce the differences between the incomes of retiredpeople as a whole and those of the working population and will, ineffect, spread a persorrs income more evenly over his life time.Thirdly, compared with benefits which are exactly proportional toincomes the weighting of the benefit formula in favour of the lower paidwill have an equalising influence, though not as much as flat-rate benefits.In addition, the dynamic element protecting the various national insurance benefits at least against inflation will help all people for whomsuch benefits are the principal source of income and should thus help toreduce inequalities,y1)    Claims^ on Economic Resources and the Balance of Payments5 8.     Rough estimates have been made of the various economic effects of the new national insurance scheme by comparing them with the effects of continuing present policies under the existing scheme, (assuming that the cost of benefits continues to be met in full from increased contributions, with the Exchequer paying the same proportion as atpresent).     Because of the difficulties in making substantial increases in contributions (either flat rate or graduated), the present method of meeting the cost of benefits - which is bound to grow if only becausethe proportion of pensioners in the population is rising - will not in factremain viable for much longer.    The estimates quoted in this and sub-sequent sections take into account, it only roughly, the impact which theproposed changes in benefits and contributions are likely to have on:personal savings, occupational pension schemes, imports and exports,payments in income tax and indirect taxes, and. savings on supplementary benefits.    The estimates are all expressed in 1968 prices.-21-
59,     It is estimated that the new scheme will cause a reduction in aggregate demand and a net release of resources of somewhat less than 200 million in the first year 1972-73, declining to some  50 million in 1977-78,    The new scheme looks like causing an increase in demand and a net claim on resources some ten years after it begins, or a littleearlier if account were taken of the resources needed to offset the adverse effect of the scheme on the balance of payments,    (see below, )The prospect of an adverse balance in the National Insurance fund would, in any case, make it necessary to raise contributions after about10 years.60,     The reduction in demand will bring some savings on importsbut the general rise in prices resulting from higher employers1contributions will at the same time cause some loss of earnings fromexports.    The scheme is likely, on balance, to produce a smalladverse effect on the balance of payments, amounting possibly to about 20 million in 1972-73, and rising possibly to around  30 millionfive years later and to around  50 million in 1982-83.    But any estimate of the effects of price changes on exports must be very uncertain,61.     The resources released by the new scheme could be used to restore and improve the balance of payments and/or to raise the levels of public and private investment or consumption.    In the present estimates, no allowance has been made for the increase in the exchequers contribution to the National Insurance Fund although it isproposed that the Exchequer should share the cost of the increased expenditure under the new scheme.(^)    Public Authorities&apos; borrowing requirements and the capital market62.     The effects of the new scheme on borrowing requirements are much less important than the effects on resources.*    In the early yearsof the new scheme, total contributions will exceed expenditure on allbenefits and the National Insurance Fund v/ill build up a substantialsurplus (see Table 1, Part IV).     On a rough estimate, the new scheme would reduce the borrowing requirement of public authorities by some 300 million in 1972-73, by some  250 million five years later and bysomewhat less than  200 million in 1982-83. f&quot;   The reduction in the borrowing requirement will dec3.ine as expenditure on benefits graduallybuilds up.*The effects differ because resources are affected (whereas borrowingrequirements are not affected) by any influence the new scheme mayhave on savings, including contributions to occupational pension schemes./These estimates include interest on the surplus in the national insurance Fund which is asaumed to be invested in government securities.-22-
63.     The reduction in the borrowing requirement of public authorities will reduce the total demand for funds on the capitalmarket.    On the other hand the probable reduction in the growth of occupational pension schemes would, in itself, reduce the volume of funds available.    As the latter effect is likely to be much smaller thanthe former, there should be a substantial net increase in funds available for private industry during the first ten years or so of thenew scheme.(4)    Cost^jiji^ Pjjces64,     The increase in employers&apos; contributions would on averageraise labour costs by about half of one per cent and would raiseprices by about a third of osae per cent.    At a later stage, theincrease in prices would probably lead to some additional pressure for raising wages,65.     The increase in employees&apos; contributions would reduce thetake-home pay of higher earners, but for those earning if timesaverage earnings or more, the reduction would be less than the normalannual increase in earnings.    This could conceivably lead to further pressure for compensating wage increases, although such a reactiondoes not seem to have followed previous increases in graduatedemployees&apos; contributions.    The new scheme wOuld reduce thecontributions of lower paid workers and so their needs could not beused to justify wage demands and there might even be less pressure on their behalf,(5)   Taxable capacity and tax revenue66,     A national insurance scheme involves the pre-emption ofeconomic resources and the hypothecation of contributions towardsspecified benefits.     Because there is a general understanding of the close link between contributions and benefits, national insurance contributions probably enable us to raise more revenue in total than would be tolerable if we sought to raise the same total by taxationalone.    An expansion of national insurance, depending on the de greeof hypothecation which is embodied in the new scheme, should thereforelead to some increase in total taxable capacity; alternatively, itshould make the total burden of taxation that much more tolerable.Because of the substantial improvements in benefits with which theyare directly associated, increases in contributions are likely, in fact,to be more acceptable at present than an equivalent increase in general taxation.67.     Though the overall increase in taxable capacity is generatedessentially by psychological factors it is nevertheless very real,Much depends on the way in which the scheme is presented.    The morecontributors are made aware that their contributions involve the accumulation of an unquestionable entitlement to benefits, the greater the increase in taxable capacity.    Separate accounts or funds for pensions and other benefits would help in this respect..23-
68,     The transfer of income from contributors to beneficiaries will increase total tax payments.    This is because the Increases in con-tribiiiions will not reduce employees&apos; taxable income, while the taxableincome of pensioners and other beneficiaries will actually be increased.(This is allowed for in the calculations).(6)   E5 s5n-I^f!iy^B^-^?^^ ^^P3:^-.on Pcc H S^i2.na-&apos;&apos;  S ?^0H5 Schejxies69.     Changes in employers1 contributions will not affect savings asthey are passed on in higher prices.    The reduction in the contributions of lower-paid workers might lead to a modest increase in their savings.The increase in the contributions of higher-paid workers may cause theirsavings to be reduced, though certainly by less than the inexease in contributions.    It is indeed conceivable that the emphasis on savingsassociated with the presentation of the scheme, might be favourable for private savings.    There is evidence that old people and others with low incomes dis-save considerably at present and the higher rates ofbenefit might increase their savings and/or reduce their dis-savings,7 0.     At least there would be one segment of the population whichwould have a positive incentive to save more.    These people for whompersonal savings can have only a small effect on their standard ofliving in retirement, because any saving beyond a certain point reducestheir need to apply for supplementary benefit.    As the plan provides forthe vast majority of contributors to expect a pension substantially abovesupplementary benefit level, the whole of any extra savings will contribute to ultimate living standards in old age.71.    In the above calculations, allowance has been made for some reduction in the development of occupational pension scheme which atpresent make an important contribution to national savings.    Theextent of this reduction depends to a considerable extent upon the reception of the scheme by employers and their pension advisers.Much therefore depends on the presentation of the scheme.    It isproposed to stress the important role which will still remain foroccupational pension schemes working in partnership with the state scheme to provide supplementary provisions for higher paid workers and to meet the special requirements of particular industries andoccupations.    The somewhat slower rate of development of these schemes In recent years may be partly the result of the uncertaintygenerated by our major review of national insurance.    If our proposals are accepted as reasonable by the industry and if we can communicate to the industry our genuine concern that occupational schemes shouldcontinue to expand to supplement the State scheme, the cut back inthese schemes may be less than we have assumed for the presentcalculations.R.H.S, C.Pi-ivy Council Office, S, W. 1.Hth October, 1968-24-
