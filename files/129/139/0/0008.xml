AS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)65C(68) 108 COPY NO. _14th October, 1968CABINETLONDON TRANSPORT REORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer see great objection to either of the courses suggested by theMinister of Transport in paragraph 7 of C(68) 103.2.      Dropping the London Bill would mean abandoning our basicprinciple, repeated in successive White Papers, that urban transport should be a responsibility of local rather than central Government.    Ifthis principle is abandoned in London there will be little prospect of implementing it in other parts of the country.3.      The alternative course suggested by the Minister (a limited risein fares coupled with a large capital payment to the Greater london council (GLC)) would represent a serious addition to Supply Votes.These attract a great deal of public attention, both at home and abroad,as was shown by our trouble over the Vote on Account last February.In addition, it could entail a sizeable addition to the central Government1 sborrowing requirement in 1969-70.4.      Either course would have serious and continuing consequences for public expenditure.    Even with a fares increase yielding  4 million,the initial deficit on London Transport (after allowing for a write-off ofcapital debt) would be at least  4 million a year and this could be expectedto rise.    In addition, there could be consequential demands forGovernment subventions to public transport in other parts of the country.5.      In my view neither of these courses is necessary.    I see noreason why we should aim at less than full viability for the london transport Board (tons) through fares increases.    Important factorsseem to me to be as follows.(i) It is wrong in principle that transport for Londoners shouldcontinue to be subsidised at the expense of taxpayers throughoutthe country. This point was made very strongly in Cmnd. 3686&quot;Transport in London&quot;.-1-
(ii) Despite this principle, we have already agreed that 90 per cent of London Transports capital debt to the Minister should be written-off prior to transfer.    But to add to this a capitalpayment, or a continuing deficit grant, would in my view be indefensible.(iii) The only way in which a deficit could be accommodated withinthe public expenditure limits we have just agreed would be ifcompensating reductions were made in other expenditurese.g, roads.    But this would be a distortion of priorities.(iv) The attitude of the Chairman of the NBPI seems reasonablyhelpful.    In debating the Bill it would seem possible, as he suggests, to accept the principle of viability, while stating thatthe implications of this for fares increases were still underconsideration (by the NBPI).(v) I am not convinced that the volume of opposition will be greatly reduced if we go for a yield of  4 million rather than one of 8 million.    In either case we should presumably have a 6d.minimum fare (which the NBPI have already endorsed) and agreater or lesser increase in other fares.(vi) Finally, I cannot see how either of the minister&apos;s proposals canbe reconciled with recent expressions of the government&apos;s policy,    I attach as an annex to this paper a selection of suchstatements.6.      In short, I believe that our policy requires us to go ahead with theLondon Bill and to achieve viability for the tons by means of an adequatefares increase.    We have already narrowed the gap by deciding on a generous write-off of capital debt, the result of which is a loss of interestpaid into the Exchequer.    Any further Government subvention would, inmy view, be quite unacceptable.    Apart from the direct cost in London,it would be impossible to implement our policy in other parts of thecountry, except at the cost of similar subventions which would in aggregate impose a quite excessive burden on taxpayers generally.7,      I therefore ask my colleagues to agree(i) that the London Bill should be introduced as planned;(ii) that the fares increases necessary to achieve viability will be endorsed before the Bill is put into effect;(iii) that the NBPI should be asked to make recommendations on the fares increases required to achieve viability.R, H, J.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.14th October, 1968-2-
ANNEXExtracts from Government Statements&quot;The basic planning of local public transport must clearly be a function of local rather than central government.    Local authorities areresponsible for the planning of their areas and the development of their local road networks, and they cannot do these jobs effectively unless they also have a broad responsibility for public transport.That is why the Government has rejected the idea of establishingnationalised Area Passenger Transport Boards ..... organising localtransport services independently of the local authorities in their area. &quot;(Cmnd. 3481 &quot;Public Transport and Traffic&quot;, paragraphs 8-9).&quot;The fact that large Exchequer deficit grants are now needed forthe /London Transport/ Board has naturally increased the urgency of measures to improve the whole transport system in London.    TheGovernment do not think it right that transport for Londoners shouldcontinue to be subsidised at the expense of taxpayers throughout thecountry - many of them faced themselves with heavy charges for their transport ....j/London/has a local government structure which makespossible ..... the fullest integration of all forms of public transport,traffic measures, and development of the most important roads ....In the Governments view, these are matters where the primary responsibility should be local .....    Within Greater London the rightplace for the main policy responsibilities is with the major localauthority - the Greater London Council ... . &quot;   (Cmnd. 3686 &quot;transport in London&quot;, paragraphs 7-8).&quot;The Government believe that urban transport is essentially alocal rather than a national matter.    Local people should be the bestjudges of the standard and quality of services they want and are preparedto pay for.    In London, the Greater London Council can appropriatelytake on this major task. &quot;   (IBID, paragraph 36).&quot;Fares, though often criticised, are lower than in many foreignundertakings.    They have gone up less, compared with pre-war, thanprices in many industries which do not face the same combination ofadverse circumstances. &quot;     (IBID, paragraph 68),-3-CON FIDE NTS AL
