S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68)Ji2 COPY NO.CABINETEFFE CT JOF E AR NINGS -RE LA TED PE NSIONSggHEMgjjTp pensions&quot;e&quot;nTITLEMENT P^^public&quot;SERVICE EMPLQYEESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 8th October, the Social Services committee invited the Minister of State, Treasury, to prepare a paper for theCabinet on the effect of the earnings-related pensions scheme on the pension entitlement of public service employees,2.     If a reasonable relationship is to be maintained between salarieson retirement up to  33 a week and total pension income on the intro-duction of the new earnings-related scheme, the occupational pensions of public servants, and others in similar schemes, will have to bescaled down.    The extent of this problem is discussed more fully inparagraphs 1 and 2 of the annex. In brief, if the occupational schemes are not amended, many of those retiring after a full career withterminal salaries of anything up to about  30 a week may find them-,selves with pensions from the occupational and State schemes whichexceed their pre.-retirement salaries,3.     Amendments in the occupational schemes will not be easy tonegotiate with staff interests, but there is some possibility that agreement can be reached provided that compensating improvementsare conceded in other features of the occupational schemes.    Thereare a number of deficiencies in the public service schemes that couldbe dealt with in this way.    Some of them are referred to inparagraph 3 of the annex,i.     The extent to which increased contributions to the State scheme can be offset by reduced contributions to occupational schemes willturn on the extent to which improvements in the latter are introduced.Unless the State as employer is to accept a substantial increase in thecost of providing pensions for public servants, the staff can reasonablylook for improvements in their occupational schemes to offset thescaling down of the personal pension or reductions in contribution rates to offset the increased contributions that most of them will fina them-selves paying for State scheme benefits, but they cannot reasonably expect both.    Details of the increases in contributions payable to theState scheme, and the resultant loss of tax relief, are given inparagraphs 6 and 7 of the annex.-1-
5.     Partial contracting out by abatement would reduce, but notremove, the need to scale down occupational benefits and would alsomoderate the increase instate scheme contributions.    But it also would mean that the scope for financing improvements in other features of occupational schemes, or alternatively for reducing occupational scheme contributionst was reduced, and it would complicate thetechnical problems of dealing adequately with over provision.Nevertheless it will probably have a strong appeal for staff, especially those in non-contributory schemes.    The effect of abatement is dealtwith more fully in paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 of the annex.6.     An increase to 65 in the minimum pension age for most malepublic servants should be considered in the course of the review ofpublic service pension schemes which the new State scheme willcompel.    But there will undoubtedly be some groups for whom an earlier retiring age is fully justified and special provision may benecessary to see them through the period until their State pensionscome into payment.    This is considered further in paragraphs 9 and 10of the annex.R. H. J.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.15th October, 1968-2-
CONFIDENTIALANNEXgHE PLICATIONS FOR .IUBIIC SERVICIS CHIMES&apos; IN ME&quot; DETAIL     &apos;    &quot;A.   Effect on benefits1,    In terms of present day earnings levels, an earnings-relatedscheme on the lines proposed will generate after the maturityperiod of 20 years retirement pensions of about  6 10s, a week onlife average earnings of  11 or  12 a week and about  12 a week on life average earnings of o 33 a -week or more.    The basicprovisions of the main public service pension schemes are standard;they provide for a maximum pension at normal retiring age of40 eightieths of salary averaged over the last three years plus a lump sum of 120 eightieths, or (in the case of the police) theapproximately equivalent pension benefit of 40 sixtieths with aright to commute a quarter.    In general, Lip to a further5 eightieths plus additional lump sun can be earned for serviceafter the normal retiring age, giving a maximum possible benefitof 45 eightieths pension plus 135 eightieths lump sum5 this beingthe approximate equivalent of a 45 sixtieths pension.    In addition,public service pensioners receive the flat rate national insurance pension of at present  4 10s. a week for a single person and 7 6s, for a married couple, a part of which, not exceeding 1 6s. a week, may in certain circumstances be offset against the occupational pension.    This is already leading to some degree ofover-provision.    (Almost all &quot;public servants are contracted out of&quot;the graduated scheme if they are members of an occupational scheme,)2,    The addition of a substantial earnings-related State pensionen top of an occupational pension of the size provided in the public services will often produce a total pension income that isexcessive by any standards.    A man retiring at the end of a fullcareer with a pensionable salary of  30 a week would receive anoccupational pension or pension plus lump- sum equivalent to some 20- 22 a week.    If his average earnings were  25 a week (as theywell might be,  especially during the period of accelerated maturity)the new State scheme would provide a pension of  10 a week.    Inother words, his retirement income would be at least as much as his salary before retirement.    Where the retiring salary was less than 30 a week, total pension income could easily exceed salary.    thus a man earning  20 a week on retirement with average career earnings of  16 a week could have the equivalent of a total pension income of some  21 or  22 a week.    (All these figures take no accountof the wife&apos;s flat rate pension, which would go to help the house-hold expenses of the married couple.)   This problem of over-provision disappears rapidly as pensionable earnings in occupational schemes rise above  33 a week, and this complicates thetask of making adjustments in the schemes.3.    It will be apparent from these figures that with theintroduction of the new earnings-related scheme, occupational schemes in the public services, and others like them, will need to be scaled down if a reasonable relationship is to be maintained between terminal salary and pension income.    This will not be atall easy to negotiate with the staff interests, who would almost certainly prefer to be contracted out of the State schemealtogether in order to avoid having to -pay extra contributions forbenefits many of which they would in any case have received at a lesser or no cost to themselves under their occupational schemes.But they may agree to some reshaping of the schemes provided thatcompensating improvements can be conceded on some of their otherleatures.   There is ample room for a deal on these lines.    The/Fulton
CONFIDENTIALPulton Committee have recommended a number of improvements inthe Civil Service scheme&apos;.    There is pressure for improvedwidows1 benefits, for which there is a good case in equity.    TheGovernment are also committed to reviewing the arrangements for increasing public service pensions in the&quot;light of thecorresponding arrangements for dynamising the new State scheme.Improvements on these lines, many of thorn highly desirable inprinciple and some of them hardly avoidable, will be verydifficult to finance unless some offsetting sewings can be found on the basic pension rates.    The net effect of the new state scheme on public service pensions is therefore likely to be a fairly radical rearrangement of the benefits, but it seems unlikely that at the end of the day their total value will bereduced.Contracting out by; abatemcntj   - effect on benefits4,    Partial contracting out by abatement (whereby thepercentage of earnings paid by members of approved occupational schemeand their   employers would be reduced with a related reductionin the employees&apos; State pensions which the employer would under-take to make good from his occupational scheme) would not make asubstantial contribution to the solution of the problem of overprovision.     The precise effect cannot be stated since it turnson the formula linking the deduction from contributions to the deduction from pension, and this has still to be determined, andon the rate of growth of earnings, and therefore of pre-awarddynamism in the State scheme.    But on reasonable assumptions itseems unlikely to be of major consequence.    If it is assumed thatthe State pension of those contracted out might be abated byI per cent of undynamised reckonable earnings for each year ofcontracted out employment, and that average money earnings  rowat a rate of 3 per cent a year, this would moan that the employee&apos;contracted out over a full contributing life would qualify for65 per cent to 87 per cent of the full State pension, depending on his age on the inception of the scheme and his average earnings.   And if money earnings rise faster than 3 per cent a year,the proportion of the full State pension payable to the contracted out -employee would be even higher.    If occupational schemesremained unamended, this would still leave many public service pensioners with a total pension income very close to, if not inexcess of, their salaries on retirement.    For example, a man whohas average career earnings of  20 a week and a final pensionablesalary of  24 a week could still have the equivalent of a totalpension income of about  23 to  25 a week.5.    Contracting out would indeed complicate rather than ease theproblems of reshaping the public service occupational schemessince full pre-award earnings dynamism would bo allowed on thewhole State pension and not merely the non-abated proportion.This is necessary since employees would otherwise be worse offif they were contracted out by employers who were not able and willing to provide the same (unpredictable) degree of dynamismas the State scheme.    But occupational schemes which basepensions on salaries in the final years before retirementautomatically provide a high degree of built in pre-awarddynamism.   The member of such a scheme who is contracted out will therefore stand to benefit from double dynamism on the   .abatedportion of his State pension, and since the rate of growth of earnings cannot be foreseen over a lengthy period with any degreeof accuracy, this will not be easy to counter./B.    Effect
CONFIDENTIALB.   Efi oct on contributio ns6,     The move from a flat rate to an earnings-related contribution in the State scheme will represent a substantial extra charge on the employees at the top end of the salary range,    The manearning  33 a week or more who is not contracted out of the new scheme will find himself &quot;paying contributions of 18s. 2d. a weekmore than the present rate of 26s.  5d.,  or an extra 23s. 5d. a weekif, like almost all members of public service schemes, he is atpresent contracted out of the graduated scheme.    It is impossibleto forecast at this stage how far this may be offset by areduction in his contributions to his occupational scheme (or,if his scheme is non-contributory, by an adjustment in the allowance made in determining his pay to take account of thatfact).    If the occupational scheme were scaled down to the full extent of the improved State pension, it might be practicable toto make 9.11 equivalent adjustment in the employee1 s contributionso that the total cost of his contributions remained more or lessunaltered.    But he would still be at some disadvantage in having to pay a higher proportion in the form of the State contribution which does not attract tax relief, and less as a contribution tohis occupational scheme which does.    At worst,  on the figuresquoted above, the  33 a week man would find that 23s. 5d. a week of his income no longer ranked for tax relief.7.     If, however, as is suggested above, staff interests arelikely to demand expensive improvements in other features of their occupational schemes as the price of their acceptance of somescaling down of the personal pension to avoid over-provision,there will clearly be little or no room for a reduction in occupational scheme contribution rates.    Improvements in totalpension provision cost money, and if that is what employees wantthey will have to face up to higher total outlay on contributions.Effect of contracting out on contrIputions8,     Partial contracting out by abatement would limit the extentof the increase in the contribution payable to the State scheme.Assuming that the contribution rate would be reduced by 1 per cent a side, the  33 a week employee would pay 11s. 7d, more than thepresent rate of 26s. 5d., or 16s. lOd. if he is already contracted out.    This is a considerable easement.    But there would he lessroom for reducing the cost of, and therefore the contributionrates payable to, the occupational schemes by scaling down their pension levels, and the final outcome might not be very differentwhether or not a scheme was contracted out.    Nevertheless, themitigation of the rate of increase in the contribution to theState scheme offered, by abatement would be attractive to staffinterests, especially where the occupational scheme was non-contributory, and they were therefore weighing an immediate and direct saving on the contribution to the State scheme against amore distant and indirect adjustment of pay.   Whatever course was adopted, substantial increases in total contribution rates to State and occupational schemes, even although they were fullymatched by improved benefits, could be expected to influencefuture pay claims.lensions on retirement beforce national pension age,S.     The minimum pension age in most of the public services is 60,Certain groups, e.g. police and prison officers, may retire/earlier
CONFIDENTIALearlier on full pension.    Leaving aside these groups, wherespecial considerations apply, it will &quot;be for consideration whether as part of the process of reshaping the public service schemes the minimum male pension age should not be raised to 65.    Thereare some weighty reasons for such a move.    65 has become theminimum pension ago in most new schemes introduced in recentyears elsewhere in the public sector and in the private sector96 per cent of all schemes provide for a minimum male pension age of 65 or over.    In the public service it is already commonfor people to go on working well beyond 60, and while a changecould clearly not be introduced overnight, it would seem rightto consider carefully whether the opportunity should not betaken to bring the generality of public servants into lino with private sector practice and wptli the State scheme minimumretiring age.10.   But whatever may be decided on that score there will always be some public servants the nature of whose duties requires aretiring age below age 65.    If the level of pensions provided bythe public service schemes has been adjusted to take account ofthe State pension which is payable only from 65, there will clearly be a strong case for some special provision to see those who have to retire early through the period until their State pension comes into payment;    It will however be important to avoid the appearance of paying the direct equivalent of the State pension to public servants some years before other members of the community qualify for it.   This is one of a large number of points on which it.will benecessary to have talks with the staff interests when theWhite Paper has been published.    Arrangements have already beenmade with the Civil Service staff associations and the unionsrepresenting the industrial employees to carry out a thoroughreview of the Civil Service superannuation scheme, in the courseof which the new situation created by the earnings-related state scheme will be taken fully into account.    Similar reviews will nodoubt be necessary in the other public services.
