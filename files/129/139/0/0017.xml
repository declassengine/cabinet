W. 1.23rd October, 1968
EARNINGS :RELATED lENSIOl^SCHEMENote by a Group of Econoniic Ady i s-e r sAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 17th October 1968 (CC(6S)42nd Conclusions, Item 6), the Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to arrange for the Economic Advisers to consider theeconomic effects of the proposed earnings-related pensions scheme,A full examination of the economic implications of a scheme as complex and extensive as this would take a long time.    In thevery limited time available to us we have been able to have onlyone discussion at which we considered Part V of the Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (C(68)106) dealing with theeconomic implications.   We have been helped by some of theeconomists concerned with the preparation of the Lord President&apos;s paper.   We give below some provisional comments on the six pointsdiscussed in Part V.1*     The standard of JLiyJ-.nXl and the disjfcribution of incomeAny projections of the relative standards of living of theretired and the working population must be uncertain;   at present we know comparatively little about the composition of retiredpeople&apos;s incomes other than from National Insurance benefits and occupational pension schemes, and the future of the latter will beaffected by the proposed new scheme to an extent which is difficultto predict.    However, given the 20 year maturity period, it seems unlikely that the new scheme will make much difference to relativestandards of living during the first ten years    but the estimateswe have seen suggest that the difference would be substantial inthe last fifteen years of this century.    In the longer run, therewould also be redistribution within the retired population,especially in favour of widows who arc at present the poorestgroup among pensioners.2-     Claims oi\ economic resources and the balance of paymentsAny scheme which raised contributions in advance of benefits would reduce demand.    The&apos; estimates of the effects on demand ofthe proposed scheme seem to be of the right order of magnitude.The estimated effect on the balance of payments in 1972/73 givenin paragraph 60 also seems reasonable on the assumption that thescheme is allowed to reduce the level of demand and employment,and thus imports.    But, if offsetting measures were taken to  .restore the level of activity the loss to the balance of paymentsmight be nearer  40 million than  20 million;    the precise effect would, however, denend on the nature of the offsetting measures taken.   The effect&quot;on demand in 1977/8 and 1982/3 is expected tobe much smaller and therefore the estimates of the effect on thebalance of payments in those years seem to be of the right orderof magnitude/3.    Public authorit i^es^-^horrdvyihfe; requirements and&quot;&apos; the -.capitalmarFetThe calculation of the effect on the public authorities1borrowing requirements is complicated.    If the reduction in demand/and
and employment caused by the scheme in the early years was offset by increased public expenditure or reduced taxation, in order tomaintain the level of activity, the reduction in the borrowingrequirements would be correspondingly less than the figure for1972/73 in paragraph 62,4,     Costs an dp prices the estimates of the effects of the scheme on costs and pricesseem broadly reasonable.5,     Taxable.....c ana city and tax r revenueThere is no empirical evidence as to whether taxable capacity iffwould be increased, in tho sense that people would be more willingto pay contributions under the new scheme than taxation or contri-.fib-but ions under the present scheme.    This must therefore be a matterof judgment.    In the longer run the commitment to additional expenditure on pensions would - to the extent that there is a limit to the amount the Government can raise in taxation and contributionscombined - reduce the scope for increases in other public expenditure programmes.6.     Personal, savings :and&quot;&apos;tho &apos; impact on becupational.^pension. schemes the estimates in the Lord President&apos;s paper assume a substantial reduction in savings through occupational pension schemes as aresult of the proposed new scheme.    The main factors affectingother forms of private savings have, in our view, been properly-set out in paragraphs 69 and 70 of the paper;   but we know of novay of estimating the net effect of these factors.
