WHITE paper the BASLE FACILITY AND THE STER11UG area the $2,000 million facility to offset fluctuations in the sterling balances of the sterling area countries which was announced at Basle on 9th September, and the related agreements which have been negotiated with sterling area countries, are a milestone in the evolution of the sterling area and a major contribution to worldmonetary stability.The Sterling Ba]:ances^2,    The oversecas-held sterling balances have been in existencefor a long time.    They first came into being because of tie major part which the United Kingdom played in the development ofinternational trade in the 19th Century.    Overseas traders found itconvenient to hold working  balances in sterling and, later on, the monetary authorities in some overseas countries came to hold partof their international reserves in sterling to meet the requirementsof their traders.    This holding of reserves :in sterling wasencouraged by the range of banking and investment facilities availablein London, which also attracted interest-seeking funds, bothofficial and private,3.   Until the beginning of the Second World War, however, the balances were relatively small.    The main increase occurred duringthe war, when the United Kingdom had to make large paymentsoverseas to meet the costs of wartime operations and the Governmentsconcerned were credited with sterling in London,    Tor many yearsthereafter the total remained broadly what it was in tie earlypost-war period, despite big changes in ownership within the total.In recent years, however, the total reserves of the overseas sterling&apos;area have risen so that sterling came to represent a smaller proportion of those reserves, and indeed a. smaller proportion oftotal world reserves.1   4CONFIDENTIALRevised Draft, 8th October 1968
2,i.D   The sterling &quot;balances fall into three main categories:-(a) Balances held &quot;by residents of non-sterling area countries..The greater part of these are now privately-held.    Over theyears there has &quot;been no very strong trend upwards ordownwards in the total hut there have been marked short-term fluctuations, reflecting confidence in sterling and interest rate differentials.(b) Privately-held sterling area balances.   These have risenwith little interruption since the war, particularly duringthe 1960s.   They show little sign of sensitivity to confid-ence and the rising trend is mainly a reflection of the strong balance of payments positions of certain overseassterling area countries and the growing value of trade donein sterling.    On the other hand, the rise in these balances,on a gross basis, has been largely matched in recent yearsby increases in United Kingdom claims on the sterling area reflecting in the main the growth of export credit,so that on a net basis there has been little overallchange.(c) Sterling area official balances.    ThecroGippsition of thispart of the balances has changed greatly since the war,as some countries have run down their sterling reserves andothers have built them up.   But until the early 1960&apos;s thetotal was relatively stable and the sterling proportion ofthe total reserves of sterling area countries remained highand relatively constant.    During the 1960&apos;s an increase in sterling area countries&apos;  trading and political links withthe non-sterling world and their growing reliance on non-sterling sources for investment and aid, led to adiversification of their reserves.    To begin with, however,this took the form simply of an accumulation of non-sterlingassets when total reserves were rising, and for the sterling area as a whole there was no significant fall inofficially-held sterling.2.CONFIDENTIAL
5o   Thus, for many years a number of divergent forces were at workwhich prevented either an   upward or downward trend in the totalsterling &quot;balances.   But at times there were marked short runfluctuations, especially in the balances of non-sterling areaholders, which could make heavy demand on the reserves of the UnitedKingdom.   These fluctuations were rarely independent of the balanceof payments position in the United Kingdom; but frequently theyreflected movements in the United Kingdom balance of payments in anexaggerated way.   The strains which could be set up by suchfluctuations were widely recognised as a potential source ofinstability to the international monetary system as a whole.?Pt^ arrangements of ,June^l9666.    In June 1966 the first positive steps were taken throughinternational co-operation to deal with this problem.   A facilitywas made available by a number of central banks to offset the effecton the United Kingdomfs reserves of fluctuations in the sterling balances.    In contrast to earlier types of central bank assistance,this facility was specifically intended not to help finance deficitsin the United Kingdom balance of payments, but solely to relievestresses arising from the international use of sterling.    Swaparrangements were made available to the Bank of England on a shortterm basis, on which drawings could be made when the balances fall below a fixed starting level.    The facility was limited in size andwas clearly intended not to finance a permanent reduction in the sterling balances but only to offset fluctuations.    In practice, ithas proved very helpful in doing this.    Since it was set up therehave been both increases and decreases in the sterling balances.The facility was renewed from June 1967 for a further year and again in 19680Devaluation and After/&apos;.   The devaluation of the pound in November 1967 was, of course, ashock to the sterling system.    In sharp contrast to what happened3.
in 191+9 y when all the currencies of the sterling area, togetherwith many other major currencies, followed sterling in devaluingagainst the UoS. dollar, in 1967 the great majority of sterling area countries made no move.    Thus, devaluation meant for them notonly loss in terms of dollar purchasing power hut, in the majorityof cases, in terms of their own currency also.    The financial links between the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area werefelt to have been loosened still further.    Moreover, the devaluationof the pound was followed by a period of general uncertainty in theinternational monetary system.    Diversification of reserves bysterling area countries increased and, in contrast to earlier periodsthere was a significant fall in the total of officially heldsterling balances as considerable sums were switched into other forms of reserves.    This movement was particularly marked in thesecond quarter of I968, when holdings of sterling by centralmonetary institutions of the sterling area were depleted by 230 million.8.   In the early part of this year, therefore, it became clear thatthere was a need for new and far-reaching arrangements to give greater stability to the sterling system.    It no longer seemed likely that the United Kingdom, acting alone, would be able to contain the situation in traditional ways.    The achievement of a balance of payments surplus by the United Kingdom was more necessarythan ever,   but it could no longer be assumed that, even with sucha surplus, sterling area countries would wish to hold as muchsterling in their reserves as in the past.9o   At the same time, there was never any possibility that thereserve role of sterling could simply be abandoned.   For the UnitedKingdom to attempt to &quot;pay off&quot; the balances in some form would have&quot;been quite impracticable and harmful to the world monetary system;in any case there was no sign that this was desired by sterling area countries.    Although there has been much academic discussion
of schemes by which some cf the functions of sterling might he taken over by some new international asset, no practical possibilitiesof this kind exist for the time being.    It was therefore clear that new means had to be found to accommodate unavoidable reductions inthe reserve balances; but at the same time to ensure that sterling would be willingly held in reserves at levels not significantlybelow the present.A new step forward 10. In the Spring of this year discussions began in Basle amongst therepresentatives of the central banks which participated in thearrangements of June 1966, together with the Bank for international settlements.    Early in July this group indicated its willingness toprovide a facility for $2,000 million, on which drawings could be made over three years and repayments would be due within ten years.   Atthe same time the British government proposed to undertakeconsultations with the governments of the sterling area and theoffer made by the Basle group was subject to the satisfactory outcome of these consultations.    The Basle countries were concerned thatthe $2,000 million facility should be amply sufficient to cover anyprospective rundown of the area&apos;s sterling balances during the next three to five years; and they were also anxious that the sterling area itself should make a contribution to the financing of thefacility.11. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, regarded the offer bythe Basle group as providing a unique opportunity to give sterling anewstability.    It was highly desirable that both the United Kingdom and overseas sterling area countries should make a contribution to thesame end.   The British government therefore proposed to all sterling area governments;&apos;  that a series of formal agreements should be concluded under which the United Kingdom would guarantee the value.*.Wlth the exception of South Africa which, although a sterling areacountry, traditionally holds most of its reserves in gold, and onlya very small proportion in sterling *5
in terms of the U.So dollar, of the greater part of the officialsterling reserves held by these countries; and   in return, each country would undertake to maintain not less than an agreedproportion of its reserves in sterling.12. These proposals were the subject of consultations during July,August and September, when teams of officials from London visitedall sterling area countries.,    By early September sufficientprogress had been made to make it possible for the Basle group to announce, on 9th September, their final decision to set up the$2,000 million facility.The Nature of the Basle Facility13. The countries participating in the Basle facility together withthe B.I.S. are Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the Federal[Republic of Germany, Italy, Jcapan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,Switzerland and the United States of America.   Under the facility,which became available after the announcement of 9th September1968, the United Kingdom is able to draw U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies from the Bank for International Settlementsas and to the extent that the sterling balances of the overseassterling area fall below an agreed starting level.    The facilitywill be usable to meet falls in both official and private balances,but, whereas the facility of June 1966 covered both sterling area and non-sterling area balances, the new facility relates only tothose held by residents of sterling area countries.   Like its predecessor it will not be available to finance any deficit inthe balance of payments of the United Kingdom.li&apos;.. The facility has a ten year life and the net amount ultimatelydrawn under it will have to be repaid between the sixth and tenthyears.    Drawings under it may be made during the first three yearsof its life.15. The facility will be administered by the Bank for international Settlements which will be able to draw on threesources of finance to meet any U.K. drawings, namely;-(i)   Borrowings at short and medium term in international markets.6
(ii)    Deposits placed with the B.LS. by overseassterling area central banks.    The countriessubscribing to the facility asked that sterling area countries should agree to deposit some part of their reserves of non-sterling currencieswith the BoIoSc, on normal hanking terms.    Theuse by the BoLC. of such funds to meet U.K.drawings will in no way restrict the freedom ofthese countries to withdraw their deposits as and when they wish.    The total will no doubt vary from time to time.    A number of countries havealready indicated their readiness to make suchdeposits.(iii)    Stand-by facilities with the twelve countries,totalling, together with a contribution by theBoIoSo  itself, $2,000 million.While it is to be expected that there will be a sizeable contri-bution from the first two sources to the financing of the facility,the twelve lending countries and the Bol.8. will carry the ultimateliability to provide funds for drawings by the Bank of Englandunder the arrangement, up to the total of $2,000 million.16. As was announced on 9th September, the earlier arrangement ofJune 1966 will be progressively liquidated and terminated by 1971.Sl^i^^arrangements.jbetv/een the &quot;United Kingdom and Overseas Sterling^e^C^i^tries; T &quot; &quot;;&quot;*-&apos;,*&quot; T&quot;&quot;**&apos;. -      -170 The texts of the Agreements containing the undertakings ofHer Majesty!s Government and other Governments in the sterling area will be presented to Parliament separately^.    The main elements in these Agreements are uniform for all sterling area countries,7*With the exception of Kuwait, with whom separate and parallelarrangements have been made.
although there are certain differences of form,    TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s guarantee to maintain the dollar value of eligibleofficial sterling reserves of sterling area countries is matched&quot;by undertakings by those countries to maintain not less than an agreed proportion of their total reserves in sterling, during the life of the Agreements,18. The guarantee applies to that part of each country&apos;s officialsterling reserves which exceeds 16 per cent of its total reserves;that is to say, 10 per cent of each country&apos;s total reserves willbe held in the form of unguaranteed sterling.    The guarantee interms of U.S. dollars means that in the event of any devaluationof sterling against the U.S. dollar, the United Kingdom would makea payment in sterling to each country to restore the dollar valueof the guaranteed portion of its sterling reserves.    The guaranteedoes not extend to private holdings or to equities held inofficial reserves.19. The guarantee is conditional on each country maintaining atall times a Minimum Sterling Proportion in its reserves.    the precise proportions have been arrived at in bilateral consultationwith each country and in most cases do not appear in the AgreementsThese proportions vary but broadly reflect the sterling proportionsat the time when negotiations began.    Although sterling proportionsvary from country to country, the arrangements, combined with theguarantee arrangements, mean that sterling; areh countries willhold 90 per cent of their reserves in the form of guaranteedsterling, non-sterling currencies or gold.20. Sterling area countries have, naturally, to take account ofthe probability of fluctuations in their reserves from time totime.    Countries which intend that such fluctuations should occur in the sterling component of their reserves will naturally have toho3.d, on average, more than the agreed Minimum Sterling Proportion.8
Some countries have in any case indicated their intention to maintainsubstantially higher sterling proportions in practice.21. The Agreements, which are in the form of exchanges of letters,came into force on 25th September 1968, and will remain in force for three years with a provision for extension for a furthertwo years by mutual agreement;    except for a few governments whichhave chosen instead an Agreement remaining in force for five years.It is provided that the Agreements may be reviewed at any time byagreement between both parties and they will be reviewed duringthe last six months of a three year period from the date of entry into force (whether the Agreements run for three or five years)i.e-0 between March and September 1971*22. In the cases of Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, where the voluntary Programme of restraint on investment from theUnited Kingdom applies; an additional provision has been included.This is that if during the operation of the Agreements, theUnited Kingdom imposes further restrictions on the flow of capitalfrom the United Kingdom to these countries, there will be immediateconsultation between the parties.The^J3ign1f 1cance^ o jthe Arrangements23* Sterling&apos;s role in the international monetary system has notexpanded over recent years.    In proportion to world reserves and world trade it has indeed contracted, and in 1968 it has contractedin absolute terms also.    But it will continue in the future as a major part of the international monetary system.   By ensuring thesmooth functioning of the sterling system the new arrangements are thus a contribution to world monetary stability.    They will benefitsterling area countries Who, although they have accepted certainlimitations on their freedom as regards the disposition of their reserves, now have a guarantee and will benefit from the strengthening of confidence in sterling which the arrangements asa whole should bring.    The United Kingdom too will gain.    The9
arrangements do not make any direct contribution to the problemof the balance of payments; nor do they in any way lessen theneed for the United Kingdom to earn substantial surpluses.    Butthey do mean that the U.K. reserves will not bo vulnerable to demands resulting from large scale movements out of sterling by countries which hold their reserves in our currency.
