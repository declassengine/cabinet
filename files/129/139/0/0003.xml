THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 103 COPY NO.llth October, 1968CABINETLONDON TRANSPORT REORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of transport at a meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy on 19th September it was decided that the First Secretary should consult the Chairman of the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) about his attitude towards the proposals for increases in london transport Board (tons) fares next year.    I have also since talkedinformally to Sir Reginald Goodwin the Leader of the Labour Group onthe Greater London Council (GLC).2.      It is worth noting that Sir Reginald informed me that in his view&quot;all hell would break out&quot; if we seek to increase fares in this way andthat we can expect considerable opposition from our own people on the glc.3. At the request of the Chairman of the NBPI I have provided him with detailed information. He has now considered it and written to me and a copy of the reply is attached.4.      I am extremely disturbed by the position we now find ourselves in :-(a) The Chairman says that the figure of  8 million to achieveviability may be too low.(b) An examination into the realism of this figure would take up tothe end of the year at least.    My officials believe it may takelonger,(c) The pattern of fares increases required to achieve the overallfigure would take until the spring cf 1969.The problem is all too clear.5.      I do not see how we can maintain any credibility for the prices and Incomes Policy if we impose the largest fares increase in the historyof London Transport having first taken the precaution of abolishing theTransport Tribunal, and refuse to put it to the NBPI.-1-
6.       On the other hand, to take a Hybrid Bill which is dependent on asubstantial price increase through second reading without being able tosay what the increase will be or how it will be applied would place theMinister concerned in a near impossible position.7.      In these circumstances I see only two real alternative s:-(i) to abandon the Bill and substitute a short Bill providing for thecontinuance of Exchequer deficit financing for London Transport;orto go ahead with it but to give explicit assurances that the increasein fares will not exceed the  4 million already agreed by the nbpi but turned down by the Transport Tribunal.    The shortfall in revenue to be underwritten by the Government.8.      Neither of these courses are easy.    Even if we write off mostof the capital debt, we will still need a fares increase.    And we shallstill be faced with a large and increasing deficit to be met by theExchequer.    With a 90 per cent write off and a fares increase of  4millionit could rise to at least  7 million by 1971.    And we shall still be in thehands of the Transport Tribunal to get a fares increase.    In short,London, unlike the other conurbations, will continue to be subsidised bythe Exchequer,9.      The alternative means we get the tons transferred - probablywithout the need to go to the NBPI (who have in effect already agreed the 4 million increase) - and that we cease to be responsible for continuingdeficit.    But obviously since we cannot put the fares up enough to meetthe whole deficit we would have to capitalise the  4 million balance.This means giving the GLC a capital sum of around  50 million.    the glc would not accept a continuing subsidy (which could be stopped atany time) and I am advised that they would not accept a tapering subsidy on the lines proposed for the other conurbation rail services.Conclusion10.      Either course is difficult.    But my own preference is for thesecond:(a) it means going on with the policy in the White Paper;(b) it puts London&apos;s transportation problems into one pair of hands;(c) it puts the inevitable fares increase in the right context;(d) it gets the Exchequer out of deficit financing.U.       I therefore seek my colleagues support going on with the Bill onthe understanding that I shall be authorised to guarantee viability by a combined fares increase and capitalisation of the remaining  4 million of annual deficit.R. W.M.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1.7th October, 1968-2-
ANNEXNational Board for Prices and Incomes,Kingsgate House,66-74 Victoria Street,London, S.W.1,From the Chairman 4th October, 1968Dear Dick,You asked me for a reply by the end of this week to your letter of27th September about the London Transport Board.If a reference were made to us we would accept the fact thatViability1 is a condition of transfer to the Greater London Council.We could not, however, without further examination, accept thatthe finding of  8 million would ensure viability.    We suspect that this figure is an under-estimate.    We base this suspicion on at least twogrounds; first, that the projected wage costs appear to us to be on thelow side;  secondly, that the projected revenues could be over-stated.An examination into the realism of this figure could be completed by December or January and it would be up to you to decide whether thisshould be done by your department or whether we should be asked to do it.The figure, when arrived at, would then need to be translated intoterms of fares increases.    I understand that the intention of the london transport Board is to arrange not for a uniform increase in fares but forselected increases.    An examination of the pattern of increases could bedone by the spring of next year and would be necessary for the implementation of the increases in the late summer or early autumn,which I gather is the London Transport Boardls intention.It is for you to decide whether the contents of this letter enable you to carry out your plan of introdiicing the bill in the second half ofNovember.    E you decide to introduce the bill then my own view would bethat, while proclaiming the principle of viability, it would be advisable for you to state that work is still proceeding on the assessment of the increases in revenue required to make the organisation viable as well asthe translation of this figure into specific fares increases.    You couldstate that the first part of this examination could be finished by the endof this year, the second part by the spring.    It would also be advisablein my view not to commit yourself irrevocably to any specific figure byway of write-off of capital or other means of Government assistance.I should be very happy to talk to you about this.Yours ever,(Signed)   Aubrey JonesThe Rt. Hon. Richard Marsh. MP
