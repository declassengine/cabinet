SECRET -      ^    698.     Amendment of the ConstitutionOrdinary amendments of the Constitution will require, as now, a vote of two-thirds of the total membership of the Legislative Assembly.A Bill to amend one of the specially entrenched provisions of theConstitution will require a vote of at least three-quarters of the total membership of both Houses voting together,     In addition there will be asystem of appeal against such an amendment either on the ground that itdiscriminates unjustly, or has the effect of discriminating unjustlybetween the races, or on the ground that it derogates from the principlesof the Declaration of Rights contained in the Constitution.     Where theBill has been adversely reported on by the Constitutional Council on either of these grounds, it will be referred by that Council to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council and will not come into effectunless and until the Judicial Committee rejects the appeal.     Where theConstitutional Council has not made an adverse report, any person who isa citizen of Rhodesia may, within a specified time, ask for a certificatefrom the Constitutional Council that there is a case for considerationby the Judicial Committee.     If the Constitutional Council grants him acertificate, he may himself appeal to the Judicial Committee within a specified time and again the Bill will not come into effect unless anduntil the Judicial Committee rejects the appeal.     If, however, theConstitutional Council refuses to grant a certificate, there can be noappeal to the Judicial Committee unless the Committee itself grants anapplication for special leave to appeal.     In that case the Bill may bebrought into effect without waiting for the appeal to be determined.This system of appeal will be unamendable for fifteen years from thecommencement of the new Constitution, thereafter it can be modified inthe same way as the other special entrenched provisions.II.^FQURTH PRINCIPLE (PROGRESS TOWARDS ENDING- RACIAL DISCRIMINATION)1i.     To give effect to the Fourth Principle, a Commission of thenecessary independence and high standing will be set up under existingRhodesian legislation.     Terms of Reference of this Commission will beagreed with the British G-overnment, who will be consulted on its composition.     It will be the Commission^ task to study and make recommendations on the problems of racial discrimination, including theLand Apportionment Act, and the possibility of extending the competence of the Constitutional Council to embrace pre-196l legislation.     Thereaftera Standing Commission will be appointed to keep the problems of racial discrimination under regular review.2.     The Commission will start work as soon as possible after the test of acceptability has been completed and the. appropriate legislation passed through the British Parliament (See IV and V below).
III.   AFRICAN EDUCATIONVigorous further action will be taken to provide such additional facilities for the education and training of Africans in Rhodesia as willenable them to develop their capabilities.     This will equip them to take up the greater employment opportunities that will be in prospect and toraise their earning capacities and standards of living, and will enablethen to play an increased part in the life and progress of their country.The British Government will provide for this purpose funds of up to 5 million a year for a period of ten years, to be matched against equalsuns to be provided by the Rhodesian Government in addition to currentlyplanned annual expenditure for these purposes.     These additional fundswill be available for capital and/or current expenditure and will be usedfor the improvement of facilities for Africans in the field of agricultural and technical training, teacher training and training in administration,and of other facilities for primary, secondary and higher education to beagreed upon between the two Governments.     There will be early discussions on the ways and means of giving effect to this offer.IV.   FIFTH PRINCIPLE (TEST OF ACCEPTABILITY)The British Government will establish a Royal Commission as soon aspossible for the purpose of testing the acceptability to the people of rhodesia as a whole of a nev7 Independence Constitution based on any agreement to be reached.2.     In the period before and during the test there will be norenewal of censorship, nornal political activities, provided they areconducted peacefully and democratically and without intimidation from any quarter, will be permitted.     The Commissioners and their staff willenjoy personal inviolability and freedom of movement.     There will be complete immunity for the witnesses heard by them.     Radio and TV facilitieswill be provided for opposition opinion to the satisfaction of theCommission.3.     Continued detention and restriction will not be authorisedunless the reviewing authorities (see 4 and 5 below) are affirmativelysatisfied, having full regard to past activities, that the persons concerned are likely to commit, or incite or conspire to commit, acts of violence orintimidation.4.    A review of such cases will b e completed in the shortest possibleti:e.     In the first instance each case will be reviewed in chambers by a judge of the Rhodesian High Court.     The judge&apos;s decision that a person should be released will be final and the person will be released forthwith.
5.     Cases in which release is not recommended by the judge will bereferred to an impartial Judicial Tribunal.     This will consist ofthree members, of whom one will be nominated by the Lord Chancellor andtr/o will be Rhodesian nominees.     The Tribunal will establish its ownprocedures and will have the power to secure the orderly conduct of its proceedings.     In addition it will have the power to sit in camera whereit is satisfied that this is necessary on the ground of security ofevidence and, though the person concerned or his legal representativewill normally be present, the Tribunal may, where there are securityconsiderations, decide to take evidence from witnesses in his absenceand that of his legal representative.6.     Persons released from detention and restriction will have fullliberty to engage in normal political activities on the same conditionsas other persons.     The Commissioners carrying out the test of acceptabilitywill have access to those not released.7.    Rhodesian Africans living abroad may apply to the Royal Commissionif they wish to return to Rhodesia during the period of the test.     TheCommission will put these cases to the Rhodesian authorities, who willeither provide safe conducts or refer thorn to the Judicial Tribunal fora decision on whether entry should be allowed.     The Tribunal will treatthese cases on the same basis as cases of detention or restriction insideRhodesia..8.    Where a detention or restriction order has been made against aperson after the establishment of the Tribunal, his case will b e referredto the Tribunal within fourteen days and considered with all possible speed,9.     As an additional task the Royal Commission will examine thepractical working of the existing arrangements for registration of voters,and will make such recommendations as it judges necessary for improvingthose arrangements, so that as many qualified persons as possible are infact registered.V.     SUBSEQUENT STEPS1.     If in the light of the report of the Royal Commission it is established that the proposed Constitutional settlement is acceptable tothe people of Rhodesia as a whole, the following steps will be taken.The British Government will legislate to introduce the RhodesianIndependence Constitution.     Complementary measures will be taken in rhodesia.     On the coming into effect of this legislation the British-5-
Government will take all action in their power to bring about an immediatediscontinuance of the economic and other sanctions at present in force.Arrangements will be put in hand to settle outstanding financial and other issues and to regularise relations between the two sides.     Rhodesianpublic servants, who have been accepted under the British government scheme and who wish to return, will be reinstated in Rhodesia.2.     If in the light of the Royal Commissions report on the arrange-nents for the registration of voters it is established that improvements in those arrangements are desirable, the Rhode sian authorities will takeurgent steps to effect them, having regard to the Royal Commission1srecommendations.VI.   INTERIM AERiNGMENTSMr. Smith will form a broad-based administration as soon as possible,including Africans.     This will remain in office until the new Constitutionhas been introduced, elections held under it and a new Parliament convened.-6-
