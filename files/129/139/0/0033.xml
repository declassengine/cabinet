DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST YTS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 133 COPY NO.__31st December, 1968CABINETUNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERS IN KENYA ANDUGANDANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and CommonwealthAffairsSince the paper attached to the Home Secretary^ memorandum c(68) 130 was prepared, our High Commissioner in Nairobi has receivedfurther information from the Kenya Ministry of Labour which suggeststhat encry permits of non-Kenyans will expire at a lower rate than was at first feared.    The latest figures are contained in Nairobi telegramno. 3940 of which a copy is attached.2.       It is now expected that the total demand for special vouchers inNairobi in 1969 will be about 3020, of which 2520 will qualify for thehighest priority.    These totals are made up as follows:-Entry permits expiring in 1969 (1300) lessapproximately 10 per cent who will choose to go to India 1170Present waiting list 850Asians leaving school in 1969 who will not get permits but are too old to qualify asdependants 300Tradesmen effected by the Trade LicensingAct 200Total priority applications 2520Applicants who are under no obligation toleave Kenya 500Total demand for vouchers 302 0Some 8000 to 9000 individuals would seek entry for settlement.3,      Although a demand for 2520 priority vouchers in 1969 would createfewer difficulties than a demand for 4500 (as forecast in C(68) 130) or for8100 vouchers, as forecast by the Permanent Secretary In the Office ofthe President of Kenya, it is still well beyond the quota of 1500 voucherswhich was established in March to provide for applications received-1-
throughout the world from United Kingdom citizens subjected to immigration control by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1968 and leaves no marginfor demand from other countries. There has been no development in thesituation in Uganda, which is potentially more serious than that in Kenya,and the general arguments set out in C(68) 130 and the suggested tacticswhich could be employed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers7 Meetingare still considered to be valid.4.       Commonwealth Governments have been informed cf our wish todiscuss the question of United Kingdom citizens in Kenya and Uganda when their Ministers are in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers1Meeting.    Few of our High Commissioners have had any reaction toreport.    The countries of the &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot; would be leastaffected by any cut back in the employment voucher scheme, but the few individuals whose entry to this country for settlement would be prejudiced might well be very angry and further restrictions on immigration would be regretted by public opinion generally as a furtherweakening of the Commonwealth link.    Official opinion in New Delhi isthat there is no numerical limit to the Anglo-Indian understanding ofJuly, 1968, under which United Kingdom citizens of Indian origin forcedto leave Kenya may opt to go to India instead, but officials were not willing to express an opinion on the possibility of the understanding beingextended to cover Uganda as well.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S. W.l.31st December, 19682-
Cypher   CAT from Priority NairobiTo Foreign and Commonwealth Office20 December, 1968Tel. No. 39^0CONFIDMTIALAddressed to Priority PoCo0o Telegram No. 391+0 of20 December RFI Routine to New Delhi, Rawalpindi and Kampala.Kenya Asians.The Kenyans have now provided the figures requested as&apos;in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 37$1 of 2 December to F.C.O.Although they come from the same source - the KenyanisationBureau in the Ministry of Labour - they are very considerablyat variance with the figures given by Kariithi,  in a sensemore favourable to us, and we should now take the laterfigures.2.     In summary,  the latest estimates are as follows.    Betweenthe first quarter of 19^9 and the end of the third quarter of1970 (i.e. a 21 month period) about 3,300 entry permits ofAsians out of a total of 5,500 for Asians and Europeans willexpire.3,     Of the 3,300 about 1,300 will expire in 1969 and 2,000in the first three quarters of 1970.1+.     To estimate the demand on the quota, the following catergories of applicants and potential applicants for vouchersmust be added:-There will be some overlap &quot;between category (a) and the 1,300.The Kenyan Government have no estimate of the consequences of the Trade Licensing Act in numerical terms and the figureof 200 is that of the Association of British Citizens.    Theirestimating is notoriously unreliable, but since they tend to exaggerate, and since the figure seems reasonable,5.     Of those whose entry permits expire,  we estimate that about 10 per cent will go to India (the present numbers aretwo applications for Indian endorsements for every fivevoucher applications, but in the categories concerned weconsider fewer will opt for India).British Asian school leavers,&quot;   who will not obtain entrypermits850300(c)Tradesmen affected by theTrade Licensing Act200
6.     An additional category (e) will be those who, while not under any obligation to leave Kenya, will nevertheless applyto do so.    They will have a lower priority that the first four categories but we should, assume a figure for them of 500.7.     On these assumptions the total for 1969 will be:-Category 1		1       850Category 1		i       300Category (	C,	1       200Entry Permits (		1    1,170Others     (		)       500Total		3,020This comprises a maximum of 2,500 of High Priority but theactual figure is likely to be smaller.8, A similar exercise for 1970, assuming 500 entry permitexpiriBS in the last quarter, gives a maximum of about 3,000applicants of high priority, and a total of 3,500&apos;.9.     The Kenyan figures are in some ways internally inconsistent,and we are looking into this,  although the margin for error is-in any case large.   However,  on any basis it seems certain thatwe shall run into difficulties on a quota of only ,1,500 a year in 1969 and 1970.    On the other hand, given the imponderablesin these estimates,  the need to keep the quota as low as possible,and the desirability of having a means of applying pressure tothe Kenyans, my first reaction is to suggest that if we offer toincrease the quota to 2,000 a year for each of the two years,with an undertaking to review in late 1970 for later years, that should (a) seem to the Kenyans to cover their immediate problem over entry permit expiries:    and(b) consequently, if v/e then run into trouble overother urgent cases, enable us to ask theKenyans to renew entry permits for at least the time necessary to see us through to 1971.10.    Further details will follow by bag, but the above gives the essential facts.F.C.0. pass to allcMr. Korris [Repeated as requested]FilesMigration and Visa Department2.
