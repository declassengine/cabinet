This draft has alreadybeen considered, at the Prime Minister ls request, by a small number ofMinisters, and it incorporates suggestions made by them,2,     The proposals for action in the draft White Paper are carefullybalanced, and together comprise a radical programme for reform,designed both to strengthen trade unionism and make it more accountable,going well beyond the Donovan recommendations in certain respects.    Inmy judgment this is the right approach for the Government though therewill inevitably be opposition on individual points from vested interests.Theme^crfJt^Djjft Whi^Pajgr3.     Conflict in industrial relations in unavoidable and not necessarilyanti-social.    In our present system, however, that conflict is in someways out of control and damages our society and economy.    This situationis the result of defects in our collective bargaining arrangements, whichare also responsible for failure to deal adequately with workers1 rights inmatters other than pay.    Changes in the institutions and practices of collective bargaining are required.    These changes must be initiated notonly by hath sides of industry.    Government intervention, too, isnecessary to ensure reform and safeguard the interests of the community,4.     After introductory sections on the role of the Government and thepresent state of industrial relations, the draft White Paper sets out thefollowing main areas for action -The Reform of Collective Bargaining   (paragraphs 19-47)The Extension of Collective Bargaining (paragraphs 48-5 8)Aids to Collective Bargaining (paragraphs 59-71)New Safeguards  (paragraphs 72-107)The following paragraphs draw attention to major proposals in the draft white Paper. New proposals and those which depart from the Donovanrecommendations are sidelined in the draft White Paper.-1-
The Kef arm of Collective Bargaining (paragraphs 19-28)5,      The draft accepts in principle the Donovan Reportrs analysis of present collective bargaining arrangements and its recommendations forthe reform of both industry-wide and company -^workplace bargaining,while pointing out that there is room for discussion on their application in different industries,^Conm^ijssi^or^6.      The draft proposes that a Commission on Industrial Relations(CIR) should be set up by Royal Warrant at once, and later put on a statutory basis.    There should be no objection to this proposal from the cbi or TUC, to judge from their comments so far received.    However,there will be criticism from other quarters of the establishment of yet another public body and of the possible duplication of its functions andthose of the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).    There is some force in these objections.    Yet on balance I am in favour of theimmediate creation of the CIR because I believe this is necessary to giveimpetus to the reform of collective bargaining.    This could not at present be successfully initiated by the NBPI in view of its identification with theapplication of prices and incomes policy.     The words used in the draftleave open the possibility of putting the CIR on a statutory- basis which willnot necessarily demand its continued existence as a separate body.7,     The functions proposed for the CIR in this part of the draft white paper are on the lines recommended by the Donovan Report, and are not likely to arouse controversy.8.     The draft proposes that procedure agreements of employersemploying more than 5,000 workers should initially be registered on a voluntary basis with the Department of Employment and Productivity(DEP); and that later this should be made compulsory.    No doubt theseproposals will be strongly opposed by the Conservative Party on the grounds that they would lead to unnecessary interference with industry;  and therewill also be left-wing suspicion that this system of registration will beused for incomes policy purposes.    But I am convinced that such asystem is necessary to secure the required managerial initiativestowards the reform of collective bargaining, and their early comments donot suggest that it will be opposed by the CBI or TUC.Collective Agreements and the Law  (paragraphs 38-42)9.     Under existing law an employer can sue an individual employee for breach of that employee^ contract of employment (for example, when the employee goes on strike without giving proper notice).     It is also possiblefor an individual employer to conclude a legally   binding agreement witha trade union if both parties so wish.    However, as explained inparagraph 42 of the draft White Paper, Section 4(4) of the Trade UnionAct. 1871 precludes the direct legal enforcement of collective agreements between an employers1 association and a trade union.    The draft white paper proposes to modify this provision, and so remove the barrier tolegally binding collective agreements of this kind.    But it is important toemphasise that the draft White Paper takes up a neutral position regardingthe desirability of making collective agreements legally enforceable;  itmerely proposes a change in the law which will ejnable employers&apos;associations and trade unions to make a collective agreement legally enforceable if both sides want to do this.-2-
3.0,     Some trade unionists may object that the policy set out in thispart of the draft White Paper is similar to proposals by the conservatives in their booklet &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; and in their mid-term policy statement &quot;Make Life Better&quot;.    There are in fact very important differences between what the draft White Paper proposes and what the Conservatives have suggested.     The draft proposes thatparties should be enabled to make legally enforceable agreements if they wish;    the Conservatives say that they would &quot;make agreements between employers and unions legally binding except where both sides specificallyagree otherwise&quot;.     The Conservative proposal is ill-jsdged because itignores the fact that the great majority of collective agreements are notin a form which can be encorced in the courts.     They are too vague andinformal.    Moreover, the Conservatives do not seem to have realised that what they want to achieve will call for more legislation than the simple repeal of Section 4(4j of the Trade Union Act, 1871.11,     Some trade unionists have already expressed fear that the repeal of Section 4(4) will automatically make all industry-wide agreementslegally enforceable.    This fear is quite unfounded-, as to make such anagreement enforceable the parties would have to intend it to beenforceable and draw it up in a form capable of enforcement.    But toavoid any misunderstanding I propose to provide that an agreement canbe made legally enforceable only if it includes an express provision inwriting to this effect.12.     A more general criticism, for example from the CBI and from a section of the daily and weekly press, will be that these proposals inparagraphs 38-42 are too weak on the enforcement of collective agree-ments.    But in my view the draft strikes the right balance on this subject.It is sensible to give parties the opportunity to make collective agreementslegally enforceable if they wish;  it is not sensible (for the reasons set outin Chapter VIII of the Donovan Report) to compel parties to make legally enforceable agreements.     Even &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; states very firmlythat &quot;it would be wrong to accord to collective agreements the quiteexceptional status of a contract which must be onforceable regardless of the wishes of the parties&quot;.Disc.losurja,of Mana jjemjajnt^Inf orjnatijor^to Tr^ade Unions and Employee^ ^iS^PM^2 L-(jBS SSJaphs 43-45)13.     The draft White Paper points out that employees  representativesneed adequate information if they are to play an effective part in collective bargaining and joint consultation.    It therefore proposes that theGovernment should have further discussions, with a view to giving tradeunions a statutory right to certain sorts of management information.The provision of such a right would be in line with proposals made in theLabour P&amp;tfty^s 1967 report on 1 Industrial Democracy&apos; and in this yearlsstatement by the National Executive Committee to the Party Conference.14.     The suggestion that the Industrial Relations Act should facilitate(not require) the appointment of trade union representatives on boards of undertakings is in line with the recommendation on this subject of a minority of the Donovan Commission (lord Collison, Professor Kahn--Freund and Mr, Woodcock).-3-SEClflET
Trade U nion Membership, Recognition, Inter Union-Disputes(paragraphs 50-5 8)15.     This section of the draft puts forward far-reaching suggestions for strengthening trade unionism and extending collective bargaining,I draw my colleagues attention particularly to the proposals that noemployer should have the right to prevent or obstruct an employee frombelonging to a trade union, and for the use of selective unilateralarbitration to assist the growth of collective bargaining, and to theproposals for dealing with inter-union disputes^    I attach importanceto the suggestion that the  TUC should have an opportunity of solvinginter-union troubles before the proposed new legal provisions areinvoked.    Those provisions will, in inter-union cases, make an employer liable to ?. fine if he failed to observe an order requiring himto recognise a union; and in inter-union disputes not solved by the TUCa union which infringed an order requiring the recognition of anotherunion would also be liable to a fine.     The draft White Paper comes downfirmly against the Tory proposal for withdrawing the protection of thelaw from trade disputes resulting from inter-union difficulties,feared r a dj3 jtf nion J^fJ^fdj^me nt ^^iB^-li^i^^^J^lL-^i? -QQ)16.     The draft puts forward the idea of grants and loans by the CIRfor trade union development,, to support efforts to raise the efficiency ofthe trade union movement,    I attach a great deal of importance to thisproposal for giving impetus to trade u.u3.oc reform without Li any wayencroaching on the autonomy of the trade union movement.SjtrJ.kesjajajd^17,     The proposals in paragraph 81 that the Secretary of State shouldhave reserve powers to require secret ballots before official strikesare called, and to require a maximum of 5&amp; days postponement in thecase of unconstitutional strikes, are highly controversiaL, especially as they envisage fines on unions failing to carry out ballots and onindividuals failing to observe a period of postponement.    Bui; theGovernment has a responsibility to safeguard the interests of thecommunity in certain circumstances.    The two measures are thereforeneeded.Strikesjand the Law (paragraphs 86-91)18.     We should reject the majority recommendation of the DonovanCommission that the protection given by Section 3 of the Trade disputes act, 1906 and by the Trade Disputes Act, 1965 should be limited toregistered trade unions and employers1 associations.    Such a limitationwould be at best useless (because employers would probably still shrinkfrom suing unofficial strike leaders) and at worst it would embitterindustrial relations and encourage local breakaway unions.19.     There might be criticism from the trade unions of the proposalnot to make any change in the law relating to picketing.    The DonovanReport recommended that Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906should be amplified so as to give express permission to the peacefulpersuasion of any customer or potential customer of an employer in dispute, and a minority proposed that picketing at a person&apos;s homeshould not be allowed.     I think it is best to leave the law as it is, aaproposed in paragraph 80.
Safeguards Against Unfair Dismissal;__Contract^of ^mj^ojmen^Act^__Jurisdiction of Indus trial Tribunals  (paragraphs 92-95)20,     These important proposals will call for legislation of a fairly-complex kind and will require a relatively large number of extra staff.The CBI is likely to oppose them all,    The TUC is against the extendedjurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunals except in cases of unfairdismissal,Trade Union Rules and Registration (paragraphs 96-101)21,     Broadly speaking, the draft accepts the recommendations of the donovan Report concerning trade union rules and registration; but notthe recommendation that trade unions should be given corporate status.My colleagues should note that it is proposed to provide for a financialpenalty on unions refusing to register.An Inde pendejit^ Revig^w B22,     Paragraph 103 of the draft suggests the setting-up of anindependent review body, as proposed by the Donovan Report (but withthe modification that it should be manned by the President and tradeunion members of the Industrial Court), to adjudicate in disputes betweentrade unions and individual members.    The TUC has expressed oppositionto the idea of an independent review body, and has suggested that thetrade union movement itself is capable of setting up any necessary machinery for this purpose.    The CBI, on the other hand, has expressedthe view that it would be wrong for trade unionists to be in a majority onche independent review body.23e     I think it would be wrong, and unacceptable to public opinion,to rely on machinery set up by the trade union movement itself to dealwith disputes between trade unions and individuals.    This is pre-eminently a situation in which justice must be seen to be done.     Therewould always be v. lack of confidence in judgments made by a tribunalcomposed only of trade union nominees against individuals who had beenin dispute with their trade unions.    On the other hand I think that thepublic would accept an independent body headed by the President of theIndustrial Court even if a majority of its members were trade unionists.An Industrial Relations Bill24.     The provisions which might be included in an industrial relations Bill are set out in Appendix I of the draft White Paper.Sjajnctions25,     The draft White Paper proposes several new legal sanctions,,It is for consideration whether the new sanctions should be imposed,when necessary, by the ordinary courts or by a special Court.    Theadvantage on the latter would be that it would help to avoid anyappearcnce that the application of the criminal law is being extended in industrial relations.-5-

ANNEX IPeople At works Policy for Industrial RelationsH,    There are necessarily conflicts of interest in industry.   The objective ofour industrial relations system should be to direct the forces producing conflicttowards constructive ends.   This can be done by the right kind of action bymanagement, unions and Government itself.   This white Paper sets out whatneeds to be done.2,    Our existing system of industrial relations fails to prevent inequity,disorder and inefficient use of manpower.   It perpetuates the existence of groups of workers who, as the result of the weakness of their bargaining position, fallbehind in the struggle to enjoy the fruits of an advanced industrial economy.In other cases management and employees are able unfairly to exploit theconsumer and endanger economic prosperity.   Small groups of strategically placedindividuals, often relatively well paid, can produce widespread disruption bylightning strikes.   The present institutions of industrial relations contributelittle to increasing efficiency.   There are still areas of industry withoutMachinery for collective bargaining.3.    Until action is taken to remedy such defects, conflict in British industry will often be damaging and anti-social.   The G-overnment places the following proposals before Parliament and the nation convinced that they are justified on two main grounds.   First, they will help to contain the destructive expression of industrial conflict and to encourage a more equitable, ordered and creativesystem of industrial relations, which will benefit both those involved and thecommunity at large.   Second, they are based on the belief that the efforts ofemployers, unions and employees to reform collective bargaining need the active support and intervention of government.k&apos;    The reasons for the first of these propositions must emerge as theGovernment&apos;s proposals are stated and explained in turn.   But there is need, atthe outset, to say something about the role of Government in industrial relations in the 1970s./the role1.
THE ROLE OF GOvSIMvIENT IN INDUSTRIAL relations.     The State has always been involved in the process of industrial relations.It has always had to provide a framework of law for dealing with the activitiesof individuals and groups struggling to advance and protect their interests.The development of stable trade unionism in the nineteenth century facedGovernments with the need to provide laws recognising and regulating theactivities of trade unions.    In the ensuing debate on the1 principles to beapplied, two conflicting philosophies emerged in reports of successive royal commissions and enquiries.   The first was this.   Trade unions should beaccepted as lawful and given the right to organise.   The State should recognise the right to strike and the right to bargain collectively to improve wagesand conditions.   But so long as the &apos;rules of the game&apos; were roughly fair to both sides the State should not be concerned with its consequences.    In effect the Government should provide facilities to help the parties agree, but shouldnot interfere to impose a settlement upon them.    It is worth stressing thatit was never any part of this view that industrial relations in general or trade unions in particular should be outside the law;    it was merely feltthat so far as possible the law should not interfere with the day to dayresults of collective bargaining.6.     But from the very beginning of this debate there was an alternative viewswhile the periodic &apos;re-adjustmont&apos; of bargaining power was an essential partof the Government!s role, it was not in itself sufficient.   The State also had to act at times to contain the disruptive consequences of the strugglefor those not immediately affected - especially if non-intervention was likely to result in widespread damage to the interests .of the community at large.   Linked with this argument to an increasing extent was a related one;Governments might be forced to intervene still- further if it could be shownthat certain important economic or social objectives were not sufficientlyfurthered or were frustrated by collective bargaining./7.   Within2.
SECRET &apos;   - - -1,    Within the last hundred years, an example of   Government action to contain the effects of disruption was   Sections 4 and 5 of the Conspiracy and Protectionof Property  Act 1875.      This was designed to limit the freedom to strike whereit was likely to have undue effects on essential services or life and property.The Truck   Acts, the creation of Wages Councils, and the establishment of a Stateinsurance scheme were examples of intervention to advance objectives which couldnot at the time be met by collective bargaining.8,    More recently intervention has become much more necessary and pronounced.The   Government has increasingly had to play a part in the industrial relations of the motor industry.     Par-reaching reforms have been initiated in theindustrial relations system of the docks.     The State has laid down minimumperiods of notice in contracts of employment in the Act of 1963.     Action hasbeen taken to secure improvements in the quality and use of labour by creatingIndustrial Training Boards and the   Redundancy Payments   Scheme, both financed bycompulsory levies on industry.9.    As a result of these and other developments both management and trade unions have come to accept, and in many ways positively to welcome, a development ofGovernment involvement in industrial relations that in practice goes far beyondthe confines of the theory of non-intervention by the State,     While often stillvoicing the doctrine of non-intervention, managements and unions have enteredinto a positive and mutually beneficial partnership with the State to securecommon objectives.     Indeed in their evidence to the   Royal   Commission on TradeUnions and   Employers&apos; Associations, and in their representations to Government,bodies representing both employers and trade unionists have urged furtherintervention and involvement - at least where they see it as advantageous to them.Demands have been made by employers for new laws to discourage strikes;    requestshave been put forward on behalf of trade unions for minimum wage legislation and government action to force employers to recognise trade unions.     In short the doctrine of non-intervention is not, and never has been, consistently preached.The need for State intervention and involvement, in association with both sides of industry, is now admitted by almost everyone.       The question that remains is,what form should it take at the present time?/THE PRESENT3.SECRET
secret the PRESENT STATE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSiO.   The answer to this question is to be found in an analysis of the present state of industrial relations in Britain.     The report of the Royal   Commissionon Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations contains the essential materialnecessary to enable both the Government and the country to decide what shouldbe the shape of industrial relations in the 1970s.11,   It shows that at its best our industrial relations system works well, andthat many criticisms which have been made of it are largely unjustified.     Thereare many companies, and even industries, in which industrial relations are wellconducted.     In general, managers who have recognised and dealt with union officials and shop stewards testified to their reason and good sense.     Similarstatements about managements were made to the Royal Commission by many union officials and shop stewards.      Research revealed few signs that trade union members were dissatisfied with their unions.     Most union officials said theyappreciated the work of stewards and the relationship between them and theirstewards appeared to be good.12,   It is not even true to say that the Royal   Commissions Inquiries and surveys reveal a state of general complacency and disinclination to change.Managements have in recent years successfully carried through some remarkableexperiments in the field of collective bargaining - many of them connected withthe growth of productivity agreements.     Rapid changes are talcing place in tradeunion organisation.     Indeed, there has probably never been a time when moreamalgamation schemes and mergers have been under discussion by the trade unionsof this country.     On both sides of industry there is a growing awareness of theneed for change, and many managers and trade union officials are making strenuous efforts to bring this about.     The measures proposed in this &quot;White Paper shouldnot be interpreted as a criticism of their efforts.     The Government&apos;s proposals are designed to assist the forces of change and to direct them into the mostconstructive channels.13.   Nevertheless, our present system of industrial relations can be criticised on three main counts.      First, imperfect competition in many industries and themarket power exercised by many firms enable unions and employers to combinetogether to raise wages        without regard to the effect on costs and prices, and-59     advance their own claims-at the expense of other members of the community,A. /1A.SECRET
14,   Secondly, the growing inter-dependence of most industry enables strategicallyplaced groups to exact advantages for themselves by inflicting disproportionatebarm &apos;*n the rest of the society.   The right of a worker to withdraw his labour isone of the essential freedoms in a democracy and the existence of this right has undoubtedly contributed to industrial progress and to the development of a morejust society.   But it is also true that in certain situations to-day the use of thestrike weapon can damage the interests of others so seriously - includingthe interests of other trade unionists - that it should only be resorted to whenall other alternatives have failed.15,   In comparison with many other countries, Britain has a large number of strikes in relation to its workforce, although our record, if measured by thenumber of workers involved and the number of working days lost, is relativelygood.     In industries other than coal-mining the number of strikes has gone upconsiderably in recent years (see Appendix 2).     The typical British strike isunofficial and usually in breach of agreed procedures;   it comes with littlewarning and is soon over.     It is commonest in a small number of industries suchas motors and components, the docks, and shipbuilding.     Other industries oftenhave long periods without strikes, but they may suffer indirectly because of astrike at a key point.      This type of strike can cause disproportionate harmand is at times exercised in complete disregard of its consequences for thecommunity.16.   Finally, our organised system of collective bargaining has not got to gripsvath a number of economic and social problems.     As the Donovan Report indicated,it has often failed to provide for effective and acceptable collective bargainingarrangements covering matters of common concern to employees and employers.Little lias been done to reform outdated and generally condemned proceduralagreements - such as those now existing in the engineering industry.      Too oftenemployees have felt that major decisions directly concerning them were beingtaken at such a high level that the decision-makers were out of reach and unableto understand the human consequences of their actions.     Decisions have beentaken to close down plants without consultation and with inadequate fore-warning to the employees.     Outdated social distinctions between hourly paid employees and those on staff conditions have been perpetuated.     At the same time, some employers have Opposed and obstructed the spread of collective bargaining to newsections of the labour force, especially those increasing numbers employed in&quot;white-collar&apos; jobs.     Unions too have often failed to involve their members. /closely
secret 387closely enough in their work, or to tackle with sufficient urgency the problemsof overlapping membership and unnecessary rivalry, which always diminish theireffectiveness and sometimes their reputation.     Many employers&apos; relations withunions have been greatly complicated by the large number of unions that may havemembers in a single factory.17.   The combined effect of such defects in our system of industrial relationsis to inorease the feeling of many employees that they have no real stake in the enterprise for which they work.       There are of course other factors too.Britain is passing through a period of rapid technological change.   New processes and methods of production are combined v/ith changing patterns of company owner-ship and management structure.     Established jobs and ways of work are disappearingto be replaced by unusual and unfamiliar tasks in surroundings often equallystrange.       This naturally reinforces feelings of insecurity among employees andeven management itself and results in lack of co-operation and resistance to change, especially if systems for dealing with legitimate grievances and problemsof all kinds do not adapt themselves to the demands placed upon them.     Efficiencysuffers and the community pays.13.   Yet there can be no reversal of the forces of change.     On the contrary,the   Government has taken action to accelerate change.       This is necessary ifBritain is to survive and prosper.     But it means that we must make sure that allemployees have the opportunity to participate in deciding the direction of change,that we must overhaul arrangements for dealing with the consequences of changeas they affect all who work in industry, and that we must remedy the defectsdescribed in the preceding paragraphs.     This requires policies to secure fourobjectives:(i)   our system of collective bargaining needs to be reformed;(ii)   it needs to be extended;(iii)   those who are involved in it need to be assisted and if necessarystrengthened;   and(iv)   the community and individuals need new safeguards.The next four sections of this White Paper explain the major measures proposedby the   Government to deal with each of these questions./THE REFORM OE6.
THE REFORM OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINIHG-19.   Collective bargaining is essentially a process by which employees take part in the management decisions that affect their working lives.    If it iscarried on by efficient management and representatives of well organisedunions, negotiating over a wide range of subjects, it represents the best method so far devised of advancing industrial democracy in the interestsof both employees and employers.   It offers the community the best opportunityfor securing well ordered progress towards higher levels of performance andthe introduction of new methods of work.20.   Yet as the Donovan Report has shown this is far from being the situationin the economy as a whole.   Even where collective bargaining is well developedit has many defects.   Very often there is a marked difference between the formal collective bargaining system and what actually happens.   It is oftensupposed that formal industry-wide negotiations are the only importantmethod of collective bargaining;   but in practice an increasing amount ofbargaining, and an increasing proportion of the wage packet, is settledoutside the 1 formal system&apos; by informal understandings and arrangements between shop stewards and managers or foremen at workplace level.   Yet thisconcentration on &apos;informality&apos;, and the network of shop floor arrangements and understandings that result from it, lead to serious problems.   Few clearprinciples and standards are developed to settle shop floor grievances.Management and unions react to passing pressures, especially when applied bywhodetermined groups/resolved to exploit their strategic position to the full-often at the expense of their fellow trade unionists.    Anomalies develop in wage payment systems.    There is no stable or equitable relationship betweenpayment and performance.   Those who are dissatisfied take unconstitutionalaction when formal systems for dealing with their grievances are noteffective and do not deal rapidly and equitably with the problems of the shop floor./21 .   Most important7.
21.   Most important of all, perhaps, this disparity between the formal system and the realities of shop floor life is often not fully appreciated or evenunderstood by senior management in the enterprises where it occurs.   As the donovan Report said, the assumptions of the formal system still exert a powerful influence over men s minds and prevent the development of effective and orderly methods of collective bargaining.   Too often senior managementcontinues to regard industrial relations as a matter for employers&apos;association officials or lower levels of management, rather than as one ofits primary responsibilities.    On the union side many national leaderscontinue to uphold the assumptions of increasingly ineffectual industry-widenegotiating structures.22.   There is room for debate about how far this description of the decay ofour formal industry-wide system of collective bargaining applies from industryto industry.   It is obviously true of large j)arts of private industry.    Somefirms in these industries have taken action to tackle the situation, and thusthrown into sharper relief the problems elsewhere in their industries.    In mostof the public sector, including national and local government service and the nationalised industries, and. in a few industries in the private sector - forexample electrical contracting - effective industry-wide collective bargainingstill exists.    There, actual wages and conditions continue to be settled bythe national officials who bargain on both sides.   There is no equivalent ofthe disordered pay structures, or the chaotic and inflationary shop floorpressure, that is so pronounced a feature of industries like engineering.23.   However, it does not follow from this that collective bargaining in such industries cannot be improved.    Their procedures may not extend to all thequestions that ought to be covered.    For instance, there may be no adequateprocedures to deal with redundancy, or the effects of introducing new machinery and methods of work.    Shop stewards may have few formal rights torepresent their members.   There may be no proper agreement to deal withdisciplinary questions, including unfair dismissal.   Pay systems may stillhe largely unrelated to performance and productivity./24.   There is
24.   There is therefore need for the reform of collective bargaining both whereindustry-wide bargaining has become ineffective and where it still determinesactual pay and conditions.   What can be done to accelerate reform?2.5.   The solution to this problem calls for the right kind of re-appraisalby managements and trade unions of collective bargaining arrangements.   Theinitiative must lie with employers, and notably the boards or chief executivesof undertakings, for they are best placed to set in train the kind of detailed study of existing systems and their defects and to make the right kind ofpositive approaches to trade unions.    Such appraisals will often show thatthe best way forward is the negotiation of formal, comprehensive and authoritative company and factory agreements.   Negotiation at these levelsis often the best way to arrive at stable and equitable pay structures,adequate procedures for the settlement of disputes and the extension of collective bargaining into matters such as discipline, redundancy arrangements and other similar questions which directly concern employees.26.   The G-overnment welcomes the readiness expressed by the C.B.I, and theT.U.C. in their joint statement of 23rd October 1968 to ask employers&apos;associations and trade unions to examine the situation industry by industryand to ask managements in consultation with the unions to review industrial relations in their undertakings.    Such re-appraisals are essential if the defects of collective bargaining are to be remedied.   They should be prompt and thorough.    There is a special need for them in industries where the defectsdescribed in the Donovan Report are apparent.    The Government will followclosely the progress of these reviews, both at company and industry level.If assistance is needed the D.E.P&apos;s Manpower and Productivity Service willbe available to help.27.   The G-overnment urges employers, in the course of these reviews, toexamine fully and sympathetically the possibility of removing unnecessary and outdated distinctions between &quot;staff&quot; and other employees.    These aresustained chiefly by tradition and inertia, and cause much unnecessaryill-feeling.    Some large employers have already found it possible to abolishthem.   The G-overnment suggests that the T.U.C. and C.B.I. should jointly9, /encourage the
encourage the abolition of these distinctions throughout industry, and make arrangements to keep the matter under review.28.   The G-overnment broadly accepts the views of the Royal Commission concerningthe principles which should inform a satisfactory set of agreements.   these should assist the negotiation of pay structures that are comprehensive, fair and conducive to efficiency.    They should also provide a link between pay andthe improvement of performance or results within the individual plant orcompany.   Subjects which should be dealt with should include the handling ofredundancies, the provision of effective rules and procedures governingdisciplinary matters, including dismissal, and the rapid and effectivesettlement of grievances. Wherever possible provision should be made forprevious conditions to be maintained while any dispute is being considered in accordance with agreed rules.   Agreements should provide adequate facilities for shop stewards to consult their members and to negotiate,reasonable access for trade union officials, and the holding of necessaryunion elections.    Managements should make available to employee representativesthe information necessary for them to do their work.   There should be provisionfor important matters to be raised with the highest levels of management.So far as possible agreements should be clear and precise./A Commission10.
Itanmision on Industrial Relations15,  The Government, too, through the work of the Department of Employment androductivity, has a responsibility to bring about the necessary changes inljr system of industrial relations.   This has caused it to expand and extendts existing arrangements for conciliation and to create a Manpower androductivity Service.    But as the Donovan Report pointed out, and as both the,U.C. and C.B.I. recognise, there remains a major gap in the public apparatusor change.    There is no institution primarily concerned with the reform of collective bargaining.   This Is why the Government proposes to establish aCommission on Industrial Relations.30.   The relationship between the Department of Employment and Productivity andthe Commission on Industrial Relations will be close and continuous.   TheCommission will work on references by the Secretary of State.    It will reportto the Secretary of State and its recommendations will be followed up by thej.E.P&apos;s Manpower and Productivity Service.    In these respects the C.I.R&apos;srelationship with the D.E.P. will be similar to that of the National Board for prices and Incomes.   But the C.I.R. is needed to do a different job, and itsmethods of operation and therefore its relationships with both sides of industrysill be rather different from those of the N.B.P.I.31.   The C.I.R. will be concerned with ways of improving and extending proceduralarrangements.   This will involve it in questions different from those which arethe subject of references to the N.B.P.I. - how to promote suitable company- wideprocedures in important firms, how to develop acceptable rules governingdisciplinary practices and dismissals, how to encourage effective and fairredundancy procedures, how to bring shop stewards within a proper framework ofagreed rules in their firm, how to ensure that they are provided with the rightkind of facilities to do their job.    To decide on the adequacy of existing-arrangements for dealing with such matters, the C.I.R. will have to find out aboutnany aspects of industrial relations in particular industries and firms - forexample, the rate of labour turnover, the arrangements for negotiations overproductivity and wages, and the causes of recent strikes.    It will be authorisedto obtain such information as is necessary for its work.   The C.I.R., unlikexhe U.B.P.I./will not be concerned with the application of prices and incomescriteria to particular disputes or settlements^   nor will it be directly concerned^ secure improvements In productivity. ^2   ^e
-    39332.   The C.I.R. will also be rl^ulrl^^y reporting on references by the Secretaryof State, to assist other reforms that are not now undertaken by any public agency,and which represent a novel extension of public involvement in industrial relations in this country.    They will include the investigation of trade union demands for recognition;   encouragement of reforms in trade union structure and services exam-ining    cases in which companies report failure to negotiate satisfactory agree-nents;    and reporting on general questions related to its responsibilities,  suchas deficiencies in factory disputes procedures or in disciplinary- procedures,over an industry, part of an industry, or an undertaking.    It will also be askedto give advice to the Secretary of State from time to time on the reform of theindustrial relations system, and to report periodically to Parliament.33.   Its contacts with trade unions, employers&apos; associations and individual firms will be regular and continuous.    It will need to gain their confidence andcn-operation while remaining an independent and. candid critic.    For this reason the Government does not propose to give it any legal sanctions, apart fromauthority to obtain information.    It looks on the CT.pi. as a disseminator ofgood practice and a focus for reform by example.   The Government hopes that thework of the C.I.R. will help to bring about a general mpve towards the reform and restructuring of collective bargaining arrangements, not least because   itwill be able to suggest to the parties mutually beneficial improvements frompractices which have been tried and found to work in other industries andundertakings.34.   The C.I.R. will have a full-time chairman and several full-time and part-time members with relevant experience.    It will be established initially as a royal Commission, to enable it to begin its work &quot;without delay.    Provisions toput it on a statutory basis will be included in an Industrial Relations bill which the Government intends to present to Parliament as soon as possible.Registration of Agreements35.   The Government will also set up a register of collective agreements.   Thiswill emphasise to managements their responsibility for the efficient conduct ofindustrial relations in their undertakings, and will provide information whichthe Department of Employment and Productivity, and the C.I.R. will need in implementing the policies set out in this White Paper.   Registration will atfirst be voluntary but the Government intends to include -previsions in theindustrial Relations Bill to make it a statutory requirement.    ConsultationsQn the scope of voluntary registration are now in progress with the C.B.I.,T&apos;U.C. and nationalised industries^JjL.J&quot;&apos;ill include;-
(1 )     Procedures for the determination of terms and conditions ofemployment.(2)     Procedures for the settlement of grievances and disputes.(3)     Arrangements for consultation concerning matters not covered &quot;by negotiation.36.   The G-overnment will shortly invite all companies and other undertakingsemploying more than 5,000 to register their procedure agreements andarrangements with the D.E.P. or to inform the D.E.P. of the absence of such agreements and arrangements.   Some smaller employers may also be asked to give information about their procedure agreements and arrangements if the D.E.P.considers this necessary.   The scope of the eventual statutory requirement to register and, within it, the subjects for registration,will be decided inconsultation with industry in the light of experience with the voluntary system.37.   The Manpower and Productivity Service of the D.E.P. will use the registered agreements to ascertain where improvements are most needed and where advice will be most helpful, and will take appropriate follow-up action.Special attention will naturally be paid to companies failing to register ormaking &quot;nil returns&quot;  for all or parts of their undertakings,  or whoseprocedure agreements seem seriously inadequate,^&quot;llsptiye Agreements and the Law38.   The present legal position is that an individual employer and a tradeunion can, if they so decide, make a collective agreement between them legally&quot;binding.   However, because many employers&apos; associations fall within the legaldefinition of a trade union, collective agreements between them and tradeunions happen to be subject to section k(k-) of the Trade Union Act 1 871, which(for other reasons altogether) precludes the direct legal enforcement of agreements between trade unions.   Agreements between trade unions and suchemployers&apos; associations therefore cannot be made directly legally enforceableeven if both parties should want this./39.   It has13.
sIEiC.liUL,itJ).   It has been suggested that collective agreements should be made legally binding unless the parties specifically decide to the contrary.   Thissuggestion ignores the fact that it is already open to individual employersand trade unions to make their agreements legally binding, and that theydo not do so.   Nothing would be gained by requiring them to say that they donot want legal enforcement, when this is already so clearly indicated bytheir actions.1-0.   Some therefore go further and suggest that all collective agreements should be made legally binding, whatever the wishes of the parties.   TheGovernment rejects this view.    It does not believe that a more orderedsystem of collective bargaining can be achieved by changing moral obligationsinto legal obligations against the wishes of those on whom the obligations rest.In particular it would be an ineffective way to tackle the very serious problem of unconstitutional strikes to give legal force to procedure agreements which are not designed for this purpose, and then look to employers to sue unconstitutional strikers.   Employers can usually sue suchstrikers already for breach of their individual contracts of employment.    Infact they hardly ever do so, because they think it will exacerbate theirindustrial relations.   The evidence is that they would do no more to securethe enforcement of legally binding agreements.41.   It has therefore been suggested that collective agreements should not onlybe made legally enforceable against the parties&apos; wishes, but be enforced byproceedings in the courts, initiated by the G-overnment or a specially createdpublic agency, against those striking in breach of agreement.   This is equallyunacceptable.   Employees may well be justified in striking in breach ofprocedure, in defence of their interests, if the procedure is slow and clumsyand protects an employer who has taken unilateral action such as victimisation.It is the responsibility of employers and trade unions to reach agreements which they think they will be able to keep, and then to see that they areobserved./2f2.   The task14.
4.2.    The task of the G-overnment is to ensure there is no legal impediment tothe observance of collective agreements negotiated between employers oremployers&apos; associations and trade unions by any method freely decided upon by the two parties.    For this reason it will propose in the industrial relations Bill the modification of section 4 (if) of the Trade Union Act 1 871 ,I so that agreements between trade unions and employers&apos;  associations will beput in the same position as those between trade unions and individual employers.   The Bill will further propose that agreements could be madelegally binding only by an express written provision in the agreement.    Itwould thus have no effect on the legal status of existing agreements, or of future agreements if the parties did not expressly decide in writing to makej&apos; them legally binding./Disclosure of Management
2)2.   The task of the Government is to ensure there is no legal impediment tothe observance of collective agreements negotiated between employers oremployers&apos; associations and trade unions by any method freely decided uponjI by the two parties.   Tor this reason it will propose in the Industriall Relations Bill the modification of section 4 (4) of the Trade Union Act 1 871 ,so that agreements between trade unions and employers&apos; associations will bej put in the same position as those between trade unions and individuall employers.    The Bill will further propose that agreements could be madelegally binding only by an express written provision in the agreement.    Itwould thus have no effect on the legal status of existing agreements, or of future agreements if the parties did not expressly decide in writing to makei them legally binding./Disclosure of Management15.
SECRETDisclosure of Management Information to Trade Union RepresentativesIf emplo^ees&apos; representatives are to participate with management on equalterms in the extension of collective bargaining and consultation at company orplant level, they will need adequate information to allow them to form anindependent judgment on management proposals, policies and decisions.   Manymanagements already recognise the need to disclose such information if negotiations are to be carried on in a climate of confidence, and find nodifficulty in making adequate safeguards for any information disclosure ofwhich might cause risk of harm to a firm&apos;s commercial interests.   But other firms are unwilling to disclose relevant information in the course of negotiations or consultation, even when no risk is involved.   This limits thesoope for informed discussion between the two sides, encourages an early retreatto entrenched positions, and thus damages industrial relations.1+4.   The Government proposes to have further consultations about this problem,with a view to including in the Industrial Relations Bill a provision to enabletrade unions to have from employers certain sorts of information that are needed for negotiations.   The safeguards needed to protect firms&apos; commercial interestswill be fully considered.Appointment of JErade Union Representatives to Boards of Undertakingsh5*   The G-overnment favours further experiments with the appointment of tradeunion representatives to the boards of undertakings, and will include in theIndustrial Relations Bill provisions on the extent to which such representatives should share the powers, and the legal and financial responsibilities, of directors.Restrictive Labour Practices46.   There can be no doubt that equipment and manpower are not always used asefficiently in this country as in other comparable industrial countries.   Thisis partly due to customs and practices which restrict the effective use of resources including manpower, for example overmanning or unnecessary overtime.On the whole such practices are operated, not by the unions, but by smallunofficial groups of employees, who see them as a way of protecting their jobsor of maintaining earnings.   Because of this, any attempt to get rid of suchpractices without adequate compensation is seen as a threat, either to earnings,16.secret
EITor to security of employment.   Their abolition therefore requires negotiationsinitiated by employers.   This is often best achieved in the context of widernegotiations aimed at producing a comprehensive agreement, since such an agreement can include alternative provisions for such matters as minimum earnings and jobsecurity, which are equally acceptable to the employees and more compatible with increasing efficiency.   The overhaul of 3ur collective bargaining system will facilitate such agreements, and will thus help to raise productivi ty.    TheGovernment agrees with the majority of the Royal Commission that penal powerswuld be of no value in this field.   In the N.B.P.I., the proposed C.I.R. andthe D.E.P.&apos;s Manpower and Productivity Service, this country will have threevaluable instruments for tackling the problem of out-of-date restrictive orprotective working practices.idnl.LTraining!f7.   An adequate supply of skilled workers is essential to the development ofthe economy.   In certain areas there are continuing shortages of some types of skilled men.   Even in the less prosperous areas experience has shown how quicklythe demand for skilled labour can grow and outstrip the supply.   These shortagescan prevent employers from using modern equipment to the best advantage or evenfrom buying it.   Likewise they can seriously hinder attempts to set up new industries in areas with a high general level of unemployment.   Both the G-overnmentand Industry already train adults to the skilled level, and the need for thiswill continue to grow.   However, in the engineering industry, in particular, all such trainees are normally registered as &quot;dilutees&quot; and opposition is still foundin some areas to allowing them to exercise fully the skills they have acquiredor to have the status of skilled workers when they are employed on skilled work.This opposition is misguided as it discourages workers from coming forward forretraining to the skilled level and reduces the ability of industry to grow andadapt itself to technological change or even to set up establishments in certain areas.   The G-overnment believes that the least required now is the freerimplementation of existing dilution agreements but also that in the longer termthese should be replaced by more flexible arrangements designed to see that menand women are employed according to their ability to do skilled jobs.   For thisreason the G-overnment has welcomed the recent statement by the Central TrainingCouncil on the urgent need to develop new attitudes to training for skilled workand is discussing with the T.U.C. and the C.B.I. the best way of making progress on the problem of adult trainees.IE&apos;c:/THE EXTENSION OF
THE EXTENSION OF COLLECTIVE BARG-AININ&amp;the Need for an Extension of Collective Bargaining48.   Even though well ordered and effective collective negotiations and discussions are the best method so far devised for the involvement of employees in the objec-tives of industry and in the acceptance of the changes necessary for economic progress j for many wox-kers such arrangements do not exist.   Major changes in the composition of the labour force have steadily reduced the relative size of manytraditional areas of trade union membership - for example mining, the railwaysand the docks.   At the same time the number of employees in areas traditionallydifficult to organise into unions has been increasing - most notably in the field of white collar employment.   The result has been that the proportion of the total labour force belonging to trade unions has actually declined in the last few years.Itf.   Yet this does not mean that trade unionism is not needed by those who have sofar not been able to develop effective organisation.   On the contrary, the numberof recognition disputes, and the continued growth of the white-collar unions, showthat this is not so.   White-collar employees have to overcome strong prejudicesamong many managements to gain recognition of their right to bargain.   The frovern-ment will encourage and help the extension of collective bargaining, and intends totake steps to remove unjustifiable obstacles to the growth of collective bargainingbased on strong and independent trade unions.   If unions had to rely on industrialsanctions to compel employers to recognise them, or if they engaged in unrestrictedcompetition among themselves, the result would be serious damage to the industrial relations system.   With the help of the C.I.R. the Government will therefore seek to avoid this situation.    It looks to unions, with the guidance of the T.U.C, toco-operate in using the new opportunities that will be created to extend their role and membership, without wasting their energies, and resources,  in unnecessarycompetition.Trade Union Membership150.   The Industrial Relations Bill will lay dovm the principle that no employerhas the right to prevent or obstruct an employee from belonging to a trade union.This principle will become a part of all contracts of employment, and the BilliWill provide that any stipulation contrary to it should be void in law.    The bill will further provide that no Friendly Society should have a rule debarring trade unionists from membership.   Employees will also be given a remedy if they aredismissed on account cf trade union membership. /Recognition
Recognition of Trade Unions by Employers51,   Recognition disputes are of two kinds:-(a) where an employer refuses to engage in genuine collective bargainingwith any unions, and(b) where he bargains with some unions but excludes others.In both cases the G-overnment will empower the C.I.R. to investigate and report onsuch disputes referred by the Secretary of State.   It will be able to take evidence from management and unions, and to look into the facts of the situation, such asthe degree of support for the union or unions involved.   It will be empowered tohold a secret ballot, if this is thought to be desirable.52.   In cases of type (a) the G-overnment will expect the C.I.R, normally to favourrecognition, if the union is appropriate and can establish that it has reasonablesupport,   A ballot is one way of showing this, but the question cannot be settled by ballot alone, for a union can often find little immediate support where therehas hitherto been little hope of recognition and, perhaps, little opportunity for recruitment;   increased support and membership follow, not preoede, recognition.53.   The G-overnment expects that in such cases most employers will agree to accept an independent and unbiased recommendation by the C.I.R.   It proposes, however, toprovide in the Industrial Relations Bill that where, despite a C.I.R. recommenda-tion in favour of recognition, the union meets continuing refusal to recognise, ora refusal to enter into genuine negotiations, the Secretary of State should be ableto take action to break the deadlock.   It has been suggested that in such circum-stances the Secretary of State should order the employer to bargain in good faith,subject to a penalty if he does not.   But this would be an inadequate way of resolving the position, since it would often be very difficult for the courts todecide whether the employer was refusing to bargain in good faith or simply taking a tough bargaining position.   Instead, therefore, where the C.I.R. recommends incases of type (a) that a union or unions should be recognised, the industrial relations Bill will enable the Secretary of State by Order to require the employer to recognise and negotiate with the union.   If he does not the union will be ableto take him to compulsory arbitration before the Industrial Court.   Employers willusually prefer negotiation to arbitration.A :\,d/54.   In19.
54,     In cases of type (d) where a -union is seeking recognition and negotiatingrights instead of, or in addition to,an already recognised union, the Governmentwill look to the T.U.C. where appropriate, to seek to resolve the conflict between the unionso    If they fail to do so within a reasonable time the matterfill be referred by the Secretary of State to the C.I.R., which will take full account of any action the T.U.C. have taken or recommendations they have made0In these conflicts which stem from the problem of multi-unionism, the C.I.R.will often be able to produce a durable solution only if its recommendationsexclude one or more unions from recognition.   If such a recommendation isinitially not accepted, the T.U.C. will be invited to use its influence to secure acceptance.   To deal with cases where this is inappropriate, e.g. where a union is not affiliated to the T.U.C., or where the T.U.C.&apos;s efforts are unsuccessful,the Industrial Relations Bill will propose a power for the Secretary of Statewhere necessary to give effect by Order to the C0I.R.&apos;s recommendations.   the employer will then be liable to a fine if he refuses to recognise the union orunions which the C.I.R. recommended should be recognised, or recognises oneagainst which it recommended.   A union which used coercive action to obstruct the implementation of the C0IoR.&apos;s recommendations would also be liable to a fine.55.     It has been suggested that inter-union disputes should be tackled byamending the legal definition of a &quot;trade dispute&quot; to exclude disputes betweenworkmen and workmen.   People who went on strike in an inter-union dispute might then be liable in some circumstances to be sued for damages, and even to be prosecuted. . However, as already explained in paragraph 40, employers have shownlittle enthusiasm for using the law in industrial relations problems, particularlyagainst their own employees.   But the chief objection to the suggestion is thatit makes no contribution to finding a fair solution to the point at issuebetween the unions.   Their dispute may involve difficult questions of industrial relations which require careful examination by people who are familiar with theproblems.   If such an examination is available, it will often be possible toavoid a strike altogether;    this is much better than changing the law to makestrike action in these circumstances liable to penalties, while leaving the basicproblem untouched.   In disputes over recognition, which are the most importanttype of inter-union dispute, the procedure proposed in the previous paragraphwill permit a full examination of the dispute by the T.U.C. and if necessary theC.I.R./Unilateral
Unilateral Arbitration SECRET56,    The Royal Commission also recommended that the Secretary of  State shouldave the power on the advice of the C.I.R. to make unilateral legally bindingarbitration available by an Order in industries, sections of industry, orundertakings where the C.I.R. has advised, after investigation, that it would contribute to the growth or maintenance of sound collective bargaining machinery.The Industrial Relations Bill will include a provision for the selectiveintroduction of unilateral legally binding arbitration before the industrial court.   The Government will have further consultations with both sides ofindustry about the situations in which this provision should be used.Wages Councils57,    The Royal Commission drew attention to ways in which the Wages Councilssystem has impeded the growth of voluntary collective bargaining and of strongtrade unionism in the industries covered, to the detriment of the workers inthose industries.    It recommended:(a) that the law should be amended to make It easier to abolish wages councils;(b) that the Wages Inspectorate should be empowered to enforce statutoryminimum rates for a limited period following abolition;(c) that it should be possible for undertakings with satisfactorycollective bargaining arrangements of their own to be excluded from thescope of Wages Councils;    and(d) that Wages Councils should be empowered to establish voluntary disputesprocedures.The Government&apos;s objective is to stimulate and strengthen voluntary collective bargaining in Wages Council industries to the point where a statutory WagesCouncil is no longer necessary.   The Royal Commission&apos;s recommendations arein line with this policy, and the Government is consulting the T.U.C., C.B.I.and Wages Councils about them.Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 195958,     Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 enablesa trade union to oblige an employer to observe the recognised terms andconditions (or others not less favourable).   The Government accepts that theSection should be amended to provide that in the consideration of claims not onlythe particular term or condition to which the claim relates but the terms andconditions observed, by the employer as a whole should have to be taken into account,This change will be included in the Industrial Relations Bill.   The Government isconsulting the T.U.C., CB.I. and Wages Councils about the recommendation that, as one way of strengthening voluntary collective bargaining, the provision which prevents Section 8 applying in Wages Council industries should be repealed.SECRET /AIDS TO COLLECTIVE
AIDS TO COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe Need far Farther Aids59.   When the State has intervened in industrial relations, it has often done so in order to assist employers and unions in the conduct of collective bargaining.   The development of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s conciliation serviceand of arbitration facilities and, most recently, the establishment of theD.E.P.&apos;s Manpower and Productivity Service are all examples of this.   the reforms proposed above will increase the need for further bargaining&apos; aids,particularly in the fields of trade union development and industrial relations training.Employers1 Associations60.   Employers&apos; associations are closely linked with industry - widebargaining.    The changes that are made in collective bargaining in their industries will decide their future role.    Amalgamations and changes in organisation will be needed.   Many associations will in future find that their main work lies in assisting members to develop collective bargainingmachinery and to improve industrial relations in their undertakings.Associations should carefully review the adequacy of their advisory services to meet such needs.   The Government will consider these questions with theC.B.I. and, where necessary, individual associations.    It intends to ensurethat general references to the C.I.R. concerning an industry or a part of an industry include consideration of changes needed in employers1 organisations.Trade Union Re-organisation61.    On the trade union side the problem is different.   British trade unions are undermanned and under-financed, even in relation to their present functions.As the Donovan Commission showed, most oomparable countries have two or three times as many full time officials in relation to the number of members as british unions.    It is true that in Britain great reliance is placed on voluntary officials, for the most part shop stewards, but the Donovan Reportalso indicates that contacts between stewards and their officials are ofteninfrequent and that they vary very much from union to union.   There are alsovery considerable communication problems arising from many unions&apos; defective22. /and out-dated
and out-dated organisation.   It would often be better for union branches to bebased on the place of work.   Too often the existence of multi-unionism meansI that in order to discuss common problems and work out a response to management initiatives shop stewards and their members have to meet in1unofficial&apos; ways which cut across the formal provisions of unionconstitutions and are outside the framework of the formally constituted -negotiating machinery.62.    This means that to take their full part in a reformed and extended systemof collective bargaining trade unions themselves need to be reformed and extended.    Among other things they need fewer areas of overlap, moreamalgamations, additional officials, specialised services, improvedconstitutions, better communications, and more adequate contributions and funds.63&apos;   As the Royal Commission said, the initiation and encouragement of tradeunion reforms of this sort are in the first place the responsibility of individual unions.   The Government looks to their executives to take urgentaction.    A major role could be played by the General Council of the TradesUnion Congress.    It could urge upon member unions the Royal Commission&apos;sproposals for the reduction of areas of competition over membership, the rationalisation of recruitment policies and the improvement of career prospects for full-time officers.    It could also encourage unions to make better provision for dual membership or easy re-admission where this would help jobmobility.    The Government will pursue these questions with the T.U.C. and individual trade unions as appropriate.A Trade Union Development SchemeI 64.   But the Donovan Report does not go far enough in its recommendations for\ modernising the trade union movement.    The Industrial Relations Bill willI provide for grants and loans to be made for this purpose by the C.I.R.    Theseigrants and loans will be made on the advice of a committee of independent and trade union members of the C.I.R.65.   The Bill will define the purposes for which assistance can be provided;these are expected to include the stimulation of union mergers, the expansionof training for union officials including shop stewards, the employment of management consultants and the development of research facilities.23* /66.   Unions
66.   Unions will be able to apply tn the C.I.R. fox grants or loans.   By analogywith the I.R.C., the C.I.R. will make sure that what is asked for will help toimprove union efficiency.. Unions wanting assistance will therefore have tosubmit a scheme to show how they intend to use the money, and to satisfy theC.I.R. that they will be able to carry through the scheme;   the C.I.R. will ensure that the grants or loans made are used in accordance with the scheme.The C.I.R. will take account of a union&apos;s own financial resources and thescope for increasing subscriptions!   it will normally provide only part ofthe t^tal funds required.   There will be no conditions intended to influencea union&apos;s behaviour in day-to-day collective bargaining,67.   Any union or federation of unions will be able to apply for developmentaid.   The T.U.C. itself will also be eligible.   The Government will have further -consultations with the T.U.C. on the details of this radical new scheme and the provision to be made for its administration by a Trade UnionDevelopment Office within the C.I.R., including the ways in which the T.U. C.might most usefully be associated with its operation.68.   Any union that regards all forms of state aid as undesirable and unnecessary will of course be free not to make use of this scheme.   But theGovernment hopes that unions generally will share its belief that such holywill contribute to greater trade union effectiveness without compromisingtrade union independence.Training in Industrial Relations69.   Most training of full-time trade union officials, and much *  thetraining of shop stewards, is undertaken by the T.U.C. and the unions&quot;-1 .t;..Y.&quot; I     &apos;&apos;,&apos;. &apos;   - ; 1   ,      &apos;, .. \ .    v. 1     V1&apos;&quot;. : ;- &apos;   -. -r 1 .  - - : \ ...    :     .j;- .        &apos; .-v &apos; .      . :     r:\ ;       - &apos;\&apos; -   .. ...      ..&apos; ,themselves.    Courses for trade unionists including shop stewards are also provided by adult education organisations, technical colleges and other bodies.The Industrial Training Boards are making increasing contributions towardsthe cost to employers of sending&apos; shop stewards on training courses.   A reform of the collective bargaining system will make it even more necessary thanit is now that trade union officers at all levels, full-time and voluntary,should be well trained.   The Trade Union Development Scheme will be able tohelp with the cost of new courses provided by the T.U.C. and the unions./The Government24.SECRET
The Government will also consider whether additional help should be given from public funds for courses provided by other bodies.    It attaches particular importance to the provision of sufficient teachers for this type of course,and the development of suitable teaching methods and materials.   The Governmentwill also discuss with Industrial Training Boards how their help can best be developed.JO.   Some employers find it useful to give their employees, for example duringinduction training, some guidance on the main provisions of the collective agreements which apply to them.   Such guidance, which need not be elaborate,helps to avoid misunderstandings and to develop a sense of participation.Other employers should consider introducing it in co-operation with unions.71.   On the management side there is an equally urgent need for training inthe techniques of industrial and human relations.   Few companies in Britainhave senior managers with a knowledge of the full range of options availableto them as a result of recent developments in payment systems, manpowerplanning, industrial sociology and psychology, or ergonomics.   particularly where company and factory-wide bargaining needs to be put on an orderly and equitable basis, management at all levels and especially at the top will need more systematic training in these matters,    The Government is consideringurgently ways of improving the situation, including the possibility of grants to encourage more training in industrial relations.HEW SAFEGUARDSTackling Strikes72.   Strikes are inevitable in a system of free collective bargaining.   but many strikes in contemporary Britain are avoidable.   No Government concernedwith the economic advancement and prosperity of the country can afford toneglect any reasonable and practical proposal for reducing their incidenceand effect,73.   The solution lies in the re-structuring of our present system ofdisordered and defective collective bargaining.   Out-dated and overloadedprocedural systems, such as that in engineering, can no longer be accepted as reasonable means of resolving disputes.   Wage systems which are out of/control25.secret
control produce unstable and inequitable pay differentials which create serious and continuing problems for management and unions.   National wage negotiationsaxe increasingly irrelevant in many industries.    In situations of this sortthe occasional use of the strike weapon is understandable, even by men whowould welcome alternatives.   But in addition to the changes in collective bargaining already outlined, the Government proposes new developments whichit believes will enable it to deploy its services more effectively andintends to take new powers./The Services of the B.E.P.26.
The   Services of the D.E.P.74.     The Department of Employment and Productivity has recently re-examined the services it and other Government-sponsored agencies provide to industry.As one aspect of this it has considered the nature and adequacy of its services for tackling strikes, lock-outs and other forms of industrial action.   The aim off the Department&apos;s conciliation service is to assist the parties to a dispute to reach a settlement for themselves or to persuade them, where appropriate, toallow it to be referred to arbitration.    Where a dispute concerns a matter of major importance affecting the public interest and it cannot be settled in otherways, the Secretary of   State may order an inquiry.   The Conciliation Act 1896and the Industrial Courts Act 1919 provide the statutory framework for these services and no major amendment of these Acts is proposed.75.     The conciliation work of the Department&apos;s Manpower Advisers (formerlyknown as Industrial Relations Officers) very often makes a valuable contributionto promoting good industrial relations and to settling a dispute.   No basicchanges are proposed, but the following important developments are to beintroduced:-(1)   In the past the Department has preferred to act only if invited byone or both parties.    In future the Department will be more ready to takethe initiative and to proffer its help.(2)   Manpower Advisers will continue to encourage observance of agreedprocedures for dealing with disputes.   They will however recognise that,as some existing procedures are defective, &quot;following procedure&quot; should notbe regarded as an end in itself.   In disputes where this applies they willregard working for a satisfactory settlement as more important.   They will,of course, do all they can to secure the introduction and observance of improved procedures;    and conciliation will often provide opportunities forthis.(3)   In some circumstances other independent persons might with advantage be used to chair negotiations, and Manpower Advisers will suggest thiswhere appropriate./(4)   In some
secret -    ,409(4-)   In some cases prompt informal investigations may avert a strike or help to promote a settlement.   Where possible it is preferable for this to be done before a dispute has resulted in a dislocation of work.   Yifriereappropriate such informal investigations will be carried out by ManpowerAdvisers (with employer and union representatives where this would help).In the light of experience the G-overnment will consider whether furtherstatutory powers are needed for this purpose.76.     The Service will be adequately staffed at all levels with officers trained and experienced in conciliation and with knowledge of the functions of managersand trade union officials.   The development of the Manpower and ProductivityService will make technical knowledge available when needed, for example on work study or job evaluation.77.     Strikes are often evidence of fundamental weakness in the system ofindustrial relations in an undertaking, e.g. defective disputes procedures, orunsatisfactory pay structures.   Manpower Advisers will consider what assistancethey can give in remedying such underlying problems.   In appropriate casesreferences will be made to the C.I.B..78.     The Government will examine further the extent to which other Government-sponsored technical advisory services can be co-ordinated with the resources ofthe Manpower and Productivity Service in the interests of simplicity, efficiency and economy.Strikes and the National Interest79.     The reforms the Government intends to initiate and encourage may take sometime, and even when they are complete there is still the possibility ofdisruptive and economically disastrous strikes which Britain can ill afford.Strikes may be official (i.e, sanctioned by the union or unions concerned inaccordance with their rules) or unofficial;    they may be constitutional (i.e.called only after the exhaustion of any appropriate procedure for handling-disputes agreed by the union or unions and the employer or his association) orunconstitutional, or may take place where there is no agreed procedure.Unconstitutional strikes are usually also unofficial.   95% of all strikes areunofficial, and three-quarters of the working days lost because of strikes are due to unofficial strikes,/80.     There havesecret28.
secret 41(80.     There have been suggestions that the Government should take powers, onthe American pattern, to delay a major official strike for two or three monthswhile further negotiations take place and a ballot is taken on the employer&apos;slast offer.   The Royal Commission examined this but concluded that the Government&apos;powers of conciliation, arbitration and inquiry, and its power to declare anemergency, were adequate, and that it was preferable that the Government&apos;sfreedom of action should be preserved.   The   Government agrees with this view.Major official strikes normally occur in this country only after fullnegotiations.    If the Government took powers of the sort proposed, it would be easy for unions to allow for them by introducing the threat of strike action at an earlier stage of negotiations than at present.    If they did this, theactual strike would be no more delayed by a statutory procedure than it isat present by the normal course of negotiations.   Even if this were not done,there is no reason to think that in this country a period of delay between theend of normal negotiations and the beginning of a strike would significantlyincrease the chances of an agreed settlement.   The situation is different inthe United States where agreements normally run for a fixed period and a strikemay quickly follow if a new agreement has not been negotiated by the time thatthe old one expires.81.     It is, however, a matter for concern that at present it is possible fora major official strike to be called when the support of those concerned maybe in doubt.   The Industrial Relations Bill will therefore propose powers forthe Secretary of  Sate, where an official strike is threatened, to require theunion or unions involved to hold a ballot on the question of strike action.The ballot will be conducted by the union, in accordance with rules approvedby the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations and in consultationwith the D.E.P. which would have to be satisfied on the question to be put tothe vote.   This power will be discretionary and will only be used where theSecretary of State believes that the strike proposed would involve a seriousthreat to the general economy or public interest, and there is doubt whetherit commands the support of those concerned.   The Secretary of State will be ableto stipulate the majority needed before a strike could go ahead, which will be either a majority of the union members involved in the dispute or two-thirds of those who voted, depending on the circumstances.   Where there is no doubt/about
about this support, and the union itself sees no need to call a ballot, therenothing to be gained by imposing one.   The object of the legislation is not toplace a bar on such strikes, but to help to ensure that before strikes of thisimportance take place the union members themselves are convinced that they areright to go on strike.82.     For the most part unconstitutional strikes - i.e. strikes which involvebreach of procedure - take place suddenly and without the permission of the boiauthorised under union rules to sanction them.   Most unions are not prepared trecognise or support strikes in breach of procedure.   Yet strikes of this sortare increasing in many industries and their effect can be very serious.Technological change and economic progress are leading, over much of industry)an increasing interdependence between firms.   This is true both within manufacindustry, and between manufacturing industry and the services such as transport on which it depends.   A strike by a key group in the long chain of production a.distribution can thus put many people out of work in other firms and even etherindustries.   It has a cumulative effect which can lead to disproportionate hanelsewhere and can be extremely costly to the nation.     In such circumstances the Government needs a reserve power to avoid precipitate strikes and to create an opportunity for further negotiation on the grievance at issue.    Such a pov/e:would not be justified where a strike, whether official or unofficial, isconstitutional and takes place after the exhaustion of an agreed disputesprocedure:    it would be an intolerable interference with the right to strike ixcircumstances where employees might have no other way of remedying a legitimattlgrievance.    It is however quite a different matter for the community to havea right, through the Government, to insist that groups of workers shall not take strike action which may seriously damage the economy and their fellowworkers in circumstances where an agreed procedure for handling disputes hasnot been observed or does not exist./83.The Government will30.SECRET
SECRET63.   The Government will therefore propose in the Industrial Relations Bill theintroduction of a further discretionary reserve power for the Secretary of Statefor Employment and Productivity for use where groups of workers strike withoutthe use of procedure and the effects are likely to be serious.   In suoh casesthe Secretary of State will be able to issue an order requiring those involvedto desist from any strike or lock-out.   For a period of up to twenty-eight days,renewable for a similar period by a further order.   This peace pause will enableevery opportunity for negotiation to be explored.   In particular, it will allowtime for any disputes procedure to be used.   Under a good procedure, it shouldbe possible for an urgent matter normally to be fully considered within twenty-eight days, or within fifty-six days if it is particularly complicated.   Unlessthe Secretary of State is satisfied that adequate machinery for reaching asettlement exists and will be used, a suitable form of public inquiry orinvestigation will be held.   The terms to be observed during such a peace pausewill be those that existed before the dispute arose, so that the delay will notprotect an employer who takes provocative action.   After the maximum period there will be no further power to delay or restrict a strike or lock-outarising from the dispute in question.84.   In both cases the requirement will need to be backed by financial penalties.In the case of the compulsory ballnt in respect of official strikes this willtake the form of a fine against the union or unions concerned, if they fail tocomply.    In the case of the peace pause, if the requirement is not complied with individual strikers will be liable to fines.85.   The Government believes that these two measures, taken together, representa sensible, fair and practical policy for tackling serious strikes.   They havethe merit of being capable of being used flexibly, when required, to help dealwith individual strikes.   In this respect they are greatly to be preferred to measures, such as have been proposed in some quarters, which would penaliseimportant and unimportant, justifiable and unjustifiable strikes alike; or wouldhe invoked haphazardly; or (if they depended upon employers) might not be invoked at all.The Present Law on Strikes86,   The new powers proposed above are selective.   They will reduce the harmcaused by too precipitate decisions to strike, without limiting the basic freedom to strike or giving employers a free hand to take provocative action.   This isthe only acceptable way to change the law on strikes.SECRET /87. The Government31.
SECRET &quot;&apos;- ... 41387.   The Government has therefore decided not to accept the Donovan Report&apos;saajority recommendation in favour of limiting to trade unions the protection given by Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act ^SOG and by the Trade disputes act 1965 in relation to inducement of breach of a contract of employment.   the implementation of this recommendation would place leaders of all unofficial strikes at risk of being sued by employers for inducing employees on strike tobreak their contracts.   The Government does not believe that this would improveindustrial relations.   In the first place, the great majority of employers wouldprobably not be prepared to take advantage of the change in the law;    this change would therefore be useless in practical terms, while creating uncertainty and thus worsening the general atmosphere in industrial relations.   For example,unions might declare all strikes by their members official to safeguard them from legal action;    or groups of unofficial strikers might constitute themselves as trade unions, in order to obtain the law&apos;s protection.   Far from helping toestablish greater order in collective bargaining, therefore, the limitation ofthe protection given by Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act 1 906 and the TradeDisputes Aot 1965 could have a seriously disruptive effect.88,   The Government has reviewed the law on picketing, but does not propose tomake any changes in it.   It believes that the present law does not place anyunreasonable limitations on picketing, and that properly enforced it providessufficient safeguards against violent or intimidatcry behaviour.89.   The Government has decided to accept the recommendation of the RoyalCommission that the inducement of breach of a commercial contract in thecircumstances of a trade dispute should be protected in the same way as theinducement of breach of a contract of employment.   The law on this is complicated;sympathetic strikes and other ways of bringing indirect pressure on an employerduring a dispute are regarded by the present law as legitimate, but they facelegal hazards in some circumstances.   This anomalous situation must be resolved.The alternative is to outlay/ sympathetic aotion.   But trade unions have a longtradition of relying on the solidarity of union members working in differentplaces, and it would be wrong to attach legal penalties to the practicalexpression of this.   It will of course be open to the Secretary of State torequire a ballot before an official, or a peace pause in an unconstitutional,sympathetic strike ,90. The TradeSEfikET
ihe Trade Dispute Disqualification x or ^nSmpxoyment Benefit14The Royal Commission recommended changes to Section 22 of the national insurance Act 1965, which concerns the disqualification of persons for receipt ofnemployment benefit when there is a trade dispute at their place of work.    If theseJjhanges were made, a claimant for benefit would no longer have to prove that he isjot a member of a &quot;grade or class&quot; of workers any of whom are participating in orfinancing or directly interested in the dispute;    and a claimant would not beregarded as &quot;financing&quot; a trade dispute simply because he is a member of a tradeanion paying strike pay to those on strike.jl.      The Government is considering these recommendations in the light of comments50 far made by the CcB0Ic, TiU.&apos;Cj and nationalised industries, and it intends tohave further consultations with then on this matter.Safeguards against Unfair Dismissal52.      The Government proposes to end the anomalous situation by which, althoughthe individual employee is protected in many other ways by legislation or collective agreements, he often has no effective safeguard against arbitrary or unfair dismissal.While it is desirable that voluntary procedures relating to dismissal should beinproved and extended, the development of such procedures is much too slow.    There-is need for legislation to establish statutory machinery to safeguard both unionistsland non-unionists against unfair dismissal.    In a period when increasing and necessary change must be accepted by large numbers of people legislation willprovide some guarantee that the inevitable uncertainties which this situation createsfill not be added to by an employer&apos;s high-handedness or prejudice.    One effect oflegislation will undoubtedly be to encourage the development of clear rules as tothe circumstances in which employees may be dismissed and for what reason.93.      The Industrial Relations Bill will state that dismissal is justified only if there is a valid reason for it connected with the capacity or conduct of the employee or based on the operational requirements of the undertaking, establishmentor service;    and that in the absence of such valid reasons it is unfair.   certain specific reasons which are not valid will be laid down, such as trade union member-S ship, race, colour, sax, marital status, religious or political opinion, nationalextraction or social origin.   Employees who consider themselves unfairly dismissedIffill have a right to complain to the present Industrial Tribunals, which will have i to be extended and equipped, to deal with this additional role.    Compensation orre-instatement may be awarded by the Tribunals.    The exact form of the procedure and of the machinery to operate it, and the extent to which voluntary procedurtescan be exempted, will be discussed in detail with the C.B.I., T.U.C., nationalised industries and other interests-Contracts of Employment Act%*      There is a strong case for revising the Contracts of Employment Act, forexample to increase long-service employees&apos;  entitlement to notice before dismissal,to shorten the minimum period of service needed to benefit from the Act, and torequire employers to give employees fuller particulars of their contracts of employ-ment.   This will be considered further in consultation with both sides of industry./Jurisdiction33.
A 1 secret &apos; - - - q 10^jurisdiction of Industrial Tribunals155,   The G-overnment in principle accepts the Royal Commission&apos;s view that it isdesirable to improve the present arrangements for the judicial determination of disputes arising out of individual contracts of employment and statutory claimsbetween employers and employees at present dealt with in the ordinary Courts.For this purpose the Report proposed that the Industrial Tribunals&apos; jurisdictionshould be extended to cover such disputes.   This will require further consultations.Trade Union Rules and Registration96.   Prejudices and unfair treatment are not a management monopoly.   They can ariseamong employees and in trade unions.   The Donovan Commission found no evidence of widespread abuse of union power.   But when union membership is accepted as desirable and actively encouraged, it is essential that unions should be able, and be seen tobe able, to conduct their business according to clear and comprehensive rules, andto deal fairly with any dispute between the union or its officers and the individual member.97.   This must be done in ways that are compatible with trade union Internal self-government and Independence.   Employees must retain the right to combine together in ways that seem to them to advance their interests.   But this must also be seen to be compatible with generally accepted standards of tolerance and fair-play.    Forthis reason, while the G-overnment does not propose to regulate union rules indetail, it considers that the present legal requirements relating to the rules of trade unions are inadequate, and should be extended in the interests both ofthe unions and their members.98.   The Industrial Relations Bill will therefore propose that trade unions shouldregister with a new Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers1 Associations within a prescribed period.   In view of the experience gained by the Registrar of friendly societies in dealing with trade union matters, the new post will for the present be combined with that of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.   Refusal to register willlay a trade union open to a fine.   Registered unions will be required to have rules governing admission, discipline, disputes between the unions and their members,elections, strike ballots, and the appointment and functions of shop stewards.Unions will be free to frame these rules to meet their own requirements and(except in the case of strike ballots - see paragraph 81) it is not proposedthat the Industrial Relations Bill should enable them to be challenged except/on
SECRETon the ground that they do not adequately cover the subjects mentioned.   ThisSriglit will lie with the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations,to whom unions will be required to submit their rules.    If he refuses to registera union, appeal will lie to the Courts.   Trade unions will be allowed reasonable time to make any necessary amendments to their rules.   Employers&apos; associationsjail also be required to register and to comply vdth appropriate requirementsabout rules.59,   The Royal Commission recommended that trade unions should be given corporatestatus.   The T.U.C. has represented that this would be undesirable, as it wouldhave no significant advantages and would not be appropriate to unions&apos;  constitu-tional structure.   The G-overnment accepts these arguments and does not propose to implement the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendation.100.   The Industrial Relations Bill will further propose that all but the smallestunions should be required to employ professional auditors and that new requirementsregarding superannuation funds for their members should be introduced.101.   At present trade unions are protected from actions in tort by Section a ofthe Trade Disputes Act 1906.   This means, for example, that a union cannot be suedfor libel or negligence (although it is possible in some circumstances to sue the trustees or the officers).   This restriction is unrealistic, and the industrial relations Bill will provide for removal of the immunity except in the circumstancesof a trade dispute.   The G-overnment agrees with the T.U..C. that this change will only be acceptable if the definition of a trade dispute is watertight, and will consider carefully what changes (if any) should be made in the present definitionfor this purpose.An Independent Review Body102.   These reforms will provide additional safeguards for union members, and do much to enable unions themselves to escape unjustified suspicions.   But for themto be seen to deal fairly with members, it is necessary that the administrationof their rules should be subject to independent review.    This does not imply thatthere is any reason to suspect frequent injustice any more than the creation of theParliamentary Commissioner implies that maladministration is common in Governmentdepartments.   But it is right and healthy in a democracy that any powerful body should be subject to outside scrutiny where abuse of its power oan most harm theindividual./103.    ComplaintsSEC&amp;ET
secret103,   Complaints by individuals against trade unions will be considered in thefirst instance by the Registrar, who will have the duty of advising the complain-ants and trying to promote an amicable settlement.    In some cases where this cannotbe achieved there is already a legal remedy in the ordinary courts, but in othersthere is no remedy at present.   The Industrial Relations Bill will provide for anew independent review body to which may be referred complaints by individuals ofunfair or arbitrary action by trade unions resulting in substantial injustice.IQLy.    In cases heard by the independent review body,  every opportunity will begiven to the trade unions concerned to prepare their own answers to complaints.The object will be to ensure fair play and justice, rather than to put obstacles in the way of unions.    If complaints are found to be justified, the review bodywill have power to award damages, or admission or re-instatement In a union.105.   The review body will be headed by the President of the Industrial Court, andits membership will consist of the members of the trade union panel of the Indust-rial Court.   Each case will be considered by the President or a legal chairmandrawn from the independent panel of the Industrial Court plus two members of thetrade union panel.106.   The Donovan Commission rejected the prohibition of the closed shop and saidthat, under proper safeguards, it could serve a useful purpose.   A closed shopmight be needed by a union to establish an effective and stable organisation orin order to deploy workers&apos; bargaining strength to the full.   Nevertheless theCommission recognised that the closed shop was liable from time to time to causeinjustice to individuals and It therefore proposed safeguards.   The G-overnmentgenerally agrees with this assessment.    It has proposed above in paragraphs 96-98measures to protect the trade union member;   it is also necessary to consider thosewho have conscientious grounds for not joining a union and who are dismissed fromtheir employment in consequence.107.   Before agreeing to a closed or union shop, employers should seek to obtainsuitable protection for people who refuse to join trade unions on conscientiousgrounds.   Many unions are prepared to accept such people in a closed or unionshop, if they in their turn are prepared to show good faith, for example bycontributing to charity instead of paying a union subscription.   When suchemployees are dismissed from employment because they will not join a union, theG-overnment proposes that the initial right of complaint should be to an Industrial&quot;Tribunal as a case of alleged unjust dismissal.SECRET Ahecov-
SECRETP The Government agrees with the majority of the Donovan Commission that theTribunal should have power to award compensation to be paid by the employerIsince it is his responsibility in concluding a closed shop agreement to bearI in mind the interests of existing employees who are not in the union, and to3 ensure that they are adequately safeguarded.    It will also be possible for theI Tribunal to award compensation to be paid by the employer if the closed shop isnot a formal one established by agreement with a union, but an informal oneresulting from the unwillingness of employees to work with a. certain non-unionist.The Tribunal will have to consider whether the employer should in any way be liableI  for acquiescence in the development of such a closed shop, and the extent to whichI  the employer should compensate an employee whom he has dismissed because he considered it to the advantage of his business to do so in tho circumstances.108.   These are tho major measures, Initiatives and policies which the government proposes to deal with the industrial relations problems now facing this country.They are intended to retain the best aspects of our traditional system - its freedom, its flexibility, tolerance and general sense of reasonable compromise,it the same time they should enable us to grapple with what is wrong;    withdisorder, injustice, occasional near chaos and damaging disruption.   They involvethe Government more closely in the processes of industrial relations, but they doso without weakening the responsibility of management and unions for the properconduct of their affairs.    On the contrary they are designed to highlight and strengthen that responsibility.    In effect they offer both management and unionsan opportunity and a challenge.   The Government proposes a joint effort to remakeand improve the relationships of people at work.A NEW OPPORTUNITY/Appendix 137.

The following table!   comparing the strike patterns of different countries is based on one published in the Donovan Report, brought up-to-date as far as possible.INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS OF STATISTICS RELATING- TO STOPPAGES DUE to industrial DISPUTES IN MINING, MANUFACTURING, CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSPORTAverage annual figures based on latest available information supplied by international Labour OfficeColumns (l), (2) and (3) - period 1964-1966Column (4) - period 1963-1967Name of Country(1)No. ofStoppagesper100,000employeesT(2)Average No.of personsinvolvedperstoppage(3)Averagedurationof eachstoppage in working daysCONo. ofworkingdays lostper 1,000employeesIted KingdomjtraliaIgium      ..radaraark       ........land      ........moo .....    ......     *jieral Republic of Germany \ublic of Ireland&apos;dy  ..   ,. ..span  ..    .,   ......herlands       ..    ..    ..     jZealandway ..Eden ..ited Statesr	350^	3.4 1.87.0	680	9.2	1*30,* 370u;	14.0 7.310.8	360	2.121.8	1,090	0.8(A)	(4)	3.625.6	450	15.232.9	720	5.37.6	1,040	2.92.2	&apos;   370	2.426.8	250	2.113?2^	100/ s\ 570 470^	26.0 15.4 14.2(2)(3)184(2)-(3)(6)(7)362v166898,414347 (5)3K1,2101,04520016184Because countries adopt different statistical practices, the figures are not strictlycomparable in every respect.   The most important variation is in the level belowwhich strikes are regarded as too small to be included;    some other countries adoptlevels lower than the United Kingdom, notably Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway andthe United States.

1 Column (1) of this table shows that in comparison with many other countries.i the U.K.has a fairly large number of strikes in relation to the size of itsI] workforce.   In this respect the U.K. has in recent years been worse off thannine of the other countries listed, but better than five (Australia, France,the Republic of Ireland, Italy and New Zealand).   As regards average numberof employees involved per stoppage (column 2), the U.K. figure falls belowthe figures for twelve of the other countries;    and as regards the averageduration of each stoppage (column 3) our figure falls below those for nine of the others.   Judged in terms of number of working days lost in relationto numbers employed (column 4), the U.K.&apos;s record has been about averagecompared with other countries.   The pattern which emerges for the U.K. istherefore one of a comparatively large number of short stoppages involving,on average, a fairly small number of employees.2. The number of stoppages in industries other than coal-mining has increasedsteadily over the last few years, as the following table shows:-UNITED KINGDOM:    NUMER OF STOPPAGES DUE TO industrial disputes,    1 957 TO OCTOBER 1968Number of stoppages:YearAltogether1957195*19591960196119621963196419651966196719682,8592,62.92,0932,8322,6862,4492,0682,5242,3541,9372,1161,965(Provisionalfigs.

I 3,     Oi\e important feature of the strike pattern in the U.K. is that the great&apos;&apos;&apos;  majority of strikes (about 95?&amp;) are unofficial, (that is, not sanctioned orratified by the union or unions concerned), as illustrated by the followingOFFICIAL, UNOFFICIAL AND OTHER STOPPAGES OF WORKDUE TO INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESAverage Annual Figure for Stoppages in the Period 1964-67TTT-Type of StoppageNo. of Stoppages )    No. of Workers.Involved (2)No. of working days Lost1 Official Strikes	82	84,700	643,000       j(3) Partly OfficialKJJ	2	600	6,000        jUnofficial	2,125	663,300	1,857,000     :Others: i.e. lockouts or strikes by unorganised workers unclassified	24	3,200	24,000     IAll	2,233	751,800	2,530,000     :Source:    Department of Employment and Productivity.(l)   Figures relate to stoppages beginning in years covered and the total.number of working days lost due to them.(2)   Includes workers thrown out of work at establishments where stoppagesoccurred, although not themselves parties to the dispute.(3)    i.e., Strikes involving more than one union and recognised as officialby at least one but not all the unions concerned.These unofficial strikes are also nearly always unconstitutional - i.e. they take place in breach of the appropriate procedure for dealing with disputes.4.      Official strikes, although few in number, tend to involve more employees and to last longer than unofficial strikes.   An official strike, because of thenumber of employees involved, can often result in a very Large number ofworking days lost.   For example, the total number of working days lost throughstoppages in the first eleven months of 1968 was 4,570,000;   of this, the one-dayengineering strike in May accounted for about 1-g: million.3.   Official strikes have not shown any consistent tendency to grow in number in recent years, the figures since i960 being as follows:-42./Number of
Number of Official Strikes, 1960-1967*1960...................631961 ...____............601962...................781963................... 491964...............____701965................... 971967...................108*   The figures include &quot;partly-official&quot; strikes, i.e,strikes involving more than, one union and recognised as official by at least one but not all the unions concerned.By contrast, the numbers of unofficial strikes have steadily risen in recentears.   The general increase in the number of strikes in industries other thanal-mining has been almost entirely due to an increase in unofficial strikes.:?tain industries have been especially prone to unofficial strikes, as thellowing table shows :-AVERAGE   ANNUAL   FIGURES   RELATING-   TO   INDUSTRIES   IK   WHICH   MOST^OFFICIAL   STRIKES   TOOK   PLACE   IN   RELATION   TO   NUMBERS   EMPLOYED, 1964-1967IndustryNumber of unofficial strikes per 100,000employeesCoal miningDocks (port and inlandwater transport)Shipbuilding, ship repairingand marine engineeringMotor vehicle manufacturingAll Industries127.765.645.234.3Number of dayslost inunofficialstrikes per1,000 employees4161,76641283184Statistics relating to the causes of strikes have to be used with caution;strike may have several causes, and the immediate cause (according to which theKlike is classified) may not be the most important one.   Most official strikes^sult from a breakdown of negotiations at industry level about trade union claimsimproved terms and conditions of employment.secret/8.   As far
8.     As far as unofficial strikes are concerned, nearly half of then inrecent years have been due to disputes over pay.   The other most frequentcauses are &quot;working arrangements, rules and discipline&quot; (about 30/j) and&quot;redundancy, dismissal, suspension etc.&quot; (about 15p).    Other causes, includingrecognition, demarcation questions, hours of work and closed shop issues account for about dfo of unofficial strikes.44.
