DOCUMENT IS THE PPv.OPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 1269th December, 1968CABINETNIGERIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsWhy we support the Federal GovernmentOur aim is to do everything possible to restore peace, stability and prosperity in Nigeria, but we must do this in a way which keeps us on good terms with the Nigerians and their rulers.    This is a Nigerian andan African problem first and foremost,2.       Nevertheless we have a great deal at stake in Nigeria.    Shell andBP have sunk at least  250 million in Nigeria and have a 50 per cent share in the Port Harcourt refinery valued at  12 million, the repair of which isnow being put in hand.    Our other investments in Nigeria are worth about 150- 175 million, and we have an export trade worth about  90, 000, 000a year,    Yfe have, moreover, about 16,000 British subjects living in nigeria.    The whole of our investments in Nigeria and particularly our oil Interests in the South-East and the Mid-West will be at risk if wechange our policy of support for the Federal Government.    The french would be glad to pick up our oil concessions if they could j they would bewell placed to do&apos;so if the Biafrans could regain control of the oil areas.3.      Although we support the Federal Government, we have urgedmoderation on them with some success (e.g, observers and the offer of relief routes).    Our practical support for the Federal Government takes the form mainly of carefully controlled amounts and types of arms whichwe sell them for cash.4.      It was undoubtedly right to help an ex colony and fellowCommonwealth country when it faced secession,    (In a speech made on 3rd December, the United States Under-Secretary of State,Mr. Katzenbach, pointed out that the United Kingdom had traditionallytrained and supplied Nigeria with arms and that we had continued to do so,and added;   &quot;I do not really see how they could have made any otherchoice, &quot;)   Jf we had stood aside at the outset of the war v/e might conceivably have been able to limit the damage to British interests, butto change our policy now would have a catastrophic effecbon our relationswith the Federal Government and put our interests in Nigeria in jeopardy.-1-MO6 MCOPY NO.
5.       But there were wider reasons for helping Nigeria when we did.U Thant said to Sir Paul Gore-Booth some time ago that he had told M. Debre that neither as an individual nor as Secretary General of theUnited Nations could he possibly approve of secession as a principle..In fact there are two thousand ethnic groups in Africa and 40 African states,and if the principle of secession on a tribal basis were once acceptedthere would be chaos on the continent.    Moreover when we gave Nigeriaindependence we agreed to put her in a position to defend herself bysupplying arms and by training programmes.    To have gone back on thissupport to a Commonwealth country when the first real threat to herintegrity developed would have been a betrayal, with serious effects onour relations with other countries in the same position.    We still believe,as we did when we granted independence to &quot;one Nigeria&quot;, that Nigerianunity is in the interests of all Nigerians (including the Ibos)j and that the disintegration of Nigeria would be disastrous both for the Nigerians andfor other countries in Africa which face similar strains.6.       Nigeria is potentially, in African terms, a major power,    A quarterof the population of Africa live within her borders.    It is important and inour interests that it should in the long run be stable, pro-Y/estern,prosperous and moderate.    Our present policy is designed to promotethis aim.The Alternatives7.       To change our policy of support for the Federal Government woulddrive the Federal Government into the arms of the Russians, who first gota foot in the door by supplying military aircraft and bombs, which were fused to supply.    Since the summer the Russians have extended theirhold, following the Parliamentary debates, which made the Nigerians thinkthat the time might come when they might no longer be able to obtain arms from this country.    They are now working assiduously to develop their position in Nigeria.    They have just signed an economic and financial agreement.    Seven hundred Nigerian students are studying in Russia.A Soviet Military Attache has just arrived in Lagos.    The Russians are planning to open Consular posts in Ibadan and Kaduna and are workinghard to develop their interest in the trade union field.    If we changecourse now, the Federal Government will be dependent on mainly theRussians, and will be likely eventually to win the war with their support:the Russians will then secure their goodwill and all that flows from it.If, on the other hand, the Biafrans succeed in holding out or in regainingsome of the southern territory, the French will reap the benefit.8.      There are three fields in which we could theoretically take new policy initiatives:(a) Arms policy(b) Peace initiative(c) Relief.-2-
9.      Arms policy for the reasons explained earlier in this paper we think it wouldbe disastrous to change our arms policy.    It would be impracticable tosecure a multilateral arms embargo in advance of a ceasefire: theFrench would deny that they have any part in supplying arms and theRussians, who must see themselves as on the point of re-establishing abase for influence in West Africa such as they lost with the fall of Nkrumah,would never forego such an opportunity.    Even to offer to negotiate an embargo would greatly harm our relations with the Federal government without securing any change for the better in Nigeria itself.    It wouldalso destroy any prospect of success for a British peace initiative by encouraging Ojukwu to stiffen his terms and undermining our influence with the Federals.10.      We could however take action on (b) and (c) as described below.A British Peace Initiative11.       The prospectsChief Enahoro told the Secretary of State that provided that theprinciple of &quot;one Nigeria&quot; was accepted, other things were negotiable.In all our negotiations with the Federal Government, they have made itclear that they are not prepared to consider a ceasefire unless this principle is guaranteed; and they maintain that otherwise the Ibos will use the ceasefire to build up their military strength and attack them asthey did at the outset of the war as soon as they see a suitable opportunity.Against this background, an unconditional ceasefire in Federal eyes simplyestablishes Blafran independence.12.      There are no signs of any corresponding flexibility on the Biafranside.    In his last major public statement on 28th October Colonel Ojukwudeclared that &quot;the war aims of Biafra are very simples to delay theenemy for as long as possible until world conscience is aroused and then to seek world support in what is essentially a human problem&quot;.    Heclaimed then that the Biafran situation had improved, that the fact that international relief operations had been bringing in a great deal of reliefitems had tended to reassure the Biafran people and had pulled up theirmorale.    He added &quot;peace, indeed everything pertaining to this wardepends on one man and one man only;  that person is Harold Wilson.    Itis he who decided for Nigeria whether to continue the war or to seek peace.No matter how reasonable the others are eventually Harold Wilson willhave to decide and Nigeria will accept&quot;.    In this speech howeverColonel Ojukwu did say that he would &quot;go anywhere for peace&quot; and added:&quot;a peace conference would always be possible provided Nigeria genuinelywants peace, unfortunately, the indications are not so at the moment&quot;.Mr. Kogbara, the unofficial Biafran representative in London, told the canadians here on 5th December that the Biafrans have no intention of negotiating at this stage since they wish first to strengthen their positionand to regain some more territory.    He asserted that Biafran secessioncould not now be called in question and said that Biafran sovereignty wasnot negotiable.    Anything short of Biafran independence could not beaccepted.    Concessions would have to come from the Federal government/ho he claimed were in a precarious position because of strains betweenthe Yorubas and the North.    There must be an unconditional ceasefire.Britain for her part must persuade Lagos to make concessions.    TheOrganisation for African Unity (OAU) was ruled out as a mediator.-3-
13,      Despite this rather bleak prospect we must continue to do oututmost to try to bring about a settlement, however difficult It may atpresent appear; it is also of great domestic political importance that weare seen to be active in this direction.    We must not at the same timefall foul of the OAU who are sensitive (as are the Federal Government)about any attempt to take the problem out of African hands and whose attitude on the fundamental issue is robust, as demonstrated by their33-4 vote at Algiers in September calling for the restoration of peace and unity in Nigeria.14.      There are, in fact two separate initiatives now being prepared,one by the OAU, the other by ourselves.    The OAU initiative is beinglaunched by the Emperor of Ethiopia, who has proposed that a fact-findingmission should visit Lagos and Biafra, and that the full OAUConsultative Committee of six Heads of State should then be re-convened.This proposal is reported to have been put both to Gowon and (v/e believe)to Ojukwu, whose reactions are not yet known.15i      Scope for a British peace moveWe have no direct contact with Ojukwu and no member of theGovernment has met him.    V/e do not know whether he is in private asinflexible as he shows himself to be in public, whether it is possible todo business with him and whether he really believes we are as omnipotentas his propaganda claims we are.    We do not even know to what extenthe himself takes the decisions in Biafra (though we believe that heprobably does) and to what extent he is in the hands of a group of advisers.It would be valuable for us to know more about this.16.      We have told General Gowon that it is out of the question for aBritish Minister to go into Biafra to meet Ojukwu.    General Gowonhas been sounded when our High Commissioner delivered the PrimeMinister^ latest letter and on the basis of his expressed trust in us isprepared to go along with a meeting between a British Minister andOjukwu outside Biafra though it v/as clear from what he said that he hasdeep suspicions about the Ivory Coast and would be very unhappy about any meeting there.    Sir David Hunt has suggested to us, Accra or Dakaras possible meeting places.    li such a meeting were to result in directtalks between the Federal Government and the Biafrans followed by asettlement we should be seen to have brought about an end to the fighting.If it failed we would be seen to have done our utmost to bring about asettlement.    Even if the meeting v/as inconclusive it would help us to seev/here Ojukwu really stood and whether there was any prospect of gettingnegotiations started.    At the very least v/e should be able to demonstrate that it was his obstinacy which was preventing a settlement.17.      If Ojukwu agreed to meet a British Minister we could try to put pressure on him to be reasonable through Nyerere and Kaunda.Mr. Arnold Smith thinks he might be able to help here.    Mr. Foleyhas sounded him about this and if we do go for a meeting we suggest heshould be urged strongly to do this extent
18.       Previous efforts have been spoilt by premature publicity, and theless we say in detail about our plans the better, although it might be expedient to announce at an early stage our intention to try to meetOjukwu.    Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers have had contacts with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Port Harcourt and with an officialrepresentative from the Ivory Coast; and it is for consideration whether we should follow up these contacts v/ith a definite invitation to Ojukwuforthwith.    If this step was taken it would be important for the emperor of Ethiopia to be told of our plans and assured that we want to gear themin with the OATJ.    For this purpose a Minister should visit Addis Ababa;and another Minister should visit Lagos to discuss our plans withGeneral Gowon.19.       If we can arrange a Ministerial meeting with Ojukwu our first objective must be to try to bring about a ceasefire on a mutually agreedbasis.    This v/e think should be as simple and straightforward aspossible (e.g. acceptance by Qjukwu of &quot;one Nigeria&quot; in some form inreturn for guarantees for the safety and future position of the Ibos).If a meeting with Colonel Ojukwu were to establish either that he was infact prepared to be reasonable if his face could be saved but would not admit this publicly, or that some new formula could be found which seemed to us to offer the seeds of a settlement, we could considerwhether to go back to General Gowon and put this to him.    If a meeting between General Gowon and Colonel Ojukwu could be arranged and. sucha ceasefire were agreed upon we would hope to arrange then for 3&quot;(a) the introduction of a Commonwealth peace force;(b) an immediate international arms embargo (enforced on the groundby outside observers);(c) the opening up of relief routes to those in need (on this, and ona possible visit by Lord Hunt to Biafra (see below), it mightbe possible to make progress with Colonel Ojukwu even if no agreement proves possible on the other points).Relief20.      The immediate need is for a decision on, and announcement of, anew contribution by Her Majesty^s Government to the International red cross in response to both the recent Red Cross world-wide appeal for 3. 2 million and also public and Parliamentary concern at suffering andstarvation In Nigeria.    Her MajestyTs Government has already given 270, 000 for relief;  it is now proposed that v/e should announce a further contribution of S.-k million to the Red Cross.,    The Treasury has agreedto this provided that corresponding savings can be found in the Ministryof Overseas Development aid programme.    The Ministry of overseas development has agreed to find  jj million savings and we hope that theycan now go on to find the other  jr million.    This is still being discussed with the Ministry of Overseas Development.    Provided that agreement on the S.j million can be reached, this could be announced next week inParliament.-5-
21.      It might also be worth while to ask Lord Hunt to go back to Nigeriato assess the present relief and starvation position, with the help of theRed Cross.    There would be little point in. a visit, however, unlessColonel Ojukwu agreed this time to let Lord Hunt or his colleagues visitBiafra.    (in July he refused and he v/ould probably refuse again).    Anew assessment might help the International Red Cross and our ownrelief effort; and Lord Hunt might be able to exert some constructiveinfluence on Ojukwu - or expose him as the obstacle to effective relief.Conclusions22.      We have three choices:(a) to continue as we are doing, merely making an announcement ofour   500, 000 contribution on relief;(b) to give way to public and Parliamentary pressure and stop thesupply of arms to the Federal Government;(c) to mount a British peace initiative.Course (a) by itself is in my view now insufficient in view of theParliamentary pressure.    Course (b) in my view would be disastrousfor British interests and would put at risk some  300 million of Britishinvestment in Nigeria and 16, 000 British subjects in Nigeria; at the veryleast it would severely damage our relations with the Federal Governmentand start us down the road towards the loss of our investments.    i therefore favour course (c), combined with course (a).M.S.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S. W.I.9th December, 1968-6-
