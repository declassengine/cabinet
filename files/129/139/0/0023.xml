&apos; SECRET w        229pOCUI/iENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVEH.N1/isn&apos;t)?!C(68) 123 COPY NO._8th November, 1968CABINETNATO AND OUR POLICY TOWARDS europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affair sIntroductionThe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is the corner-stone of our defence and foreign policy.    Achieving entry into theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) is a central foreign policyobjective.    We have already decided that from now on our maindefence effort will be in Europe and the Norm Atlantic Area.    Ithas, for some time, been our policy to promote closer co-operationamong European members of NATO on defence as part of our aim ofa united Europe, including this country.    The problems that we facein these complementary areas of defence and foreign policy have muchin common.     The Secretary of State for Defence and I keep in close touchin our handling of these matters.NATO:  general,       The next year or so will, in any case, be important for NATO,Several problems face the Alliance: -(a) The North Atlantic Treaty is of indefinite duration, as wasaffirmed by the allies in 1954.    But as from August, 1969, member states will be able to withdraw from the Alliance, provided that they give one year&apos;s notice.    There is at present no evidence that any memberintends to withdraw, but the possibility exists, and French intentionsremain open to doubt.(b) The Alliance has accepted a strategy of flexible response ratherthan a trip-wire strategy of immediate nuclear response.    But thiscalls for a readjustment of defence effort and for more and betterequipped conventional forces, at a time when many member governments are unable or unwilling to increase their defencebudgets.(c) The Americans may well seek to reduce the level of their forces in Europe in the next year or two.    This would increase the pressure on the Europeans to do more and lead to tension within the alliance,-1-
3,       These problems present the European members of NATO inparticular with a challenge and an opportunity.    Successful european co-operation within NATO could make it easier to handle all threeproblems,NATO:  Post Czechoslovakia4.       The Czech crisis has inevitably set back in time the process ofdetente, although it remains an ultimate aim.    It is still soon to be sure of the long-term implications;  an assessment of these is now in hand.But it is generally agreed that there is increased uncertainty in europe and a need for NATO to ensure that its defence and deterrence iseffective.,    As this has been a crisis in the heart of Europe, theproblem particularly affects the European members,    This providesan opportunity to move forward the process of European collaboration.The Americans have emphasised that a clear sign of collective Europeaneffort will assist the United States Government in resisting pressure fortroop withdrawals from Europe.5.       Our object in recent weeks has therefore been to help to promote a collective European response within the framework of Atlanticco-operation.    We have offered improvements in our own contributionto NATO by a stronger naval presence in the Mediterranean, a greatercommitment to the Allied Command Europe (ACE) Mobile Force and byexpressing our readiness to conduct an exercise on NATO&apos;s NorthernFlank.    The scale and nature of our offers to improve our contributionto the Alliance have been, and will continue to be, governed by the need to keep within planned Defence Budget targets and to conserve foreign exchange expenditure.    We have made our offers in the hope of encouragingother members of the Alliance to make real improvements in their forcecontributions.    We have been making it clear that in our view, this is thefirst step in what we envisage as a developing pattern of collaborationamong the European members in dealing with NATO&apos;s problems.Europe: General6.       Since the last French veto, we have maintained our applicationfor membership and have continued to press for action in fields wherethe French have no veto.    We have kept the issue of European integrationand our participation in it alive.    French obstruction is increasinglyrecognised by the other members of the e.c..    It is our hope thatcontinued exposure of the French attitude will encourage other membersof the e.c. to pursue a more robust and independent line.Europe:  The Harmel Initiative7,       The Harmel initiative, launched in September, serves these purposes.    It envisages co-operation between ourselves and membersof the e.c. in a number of areas not covered by the Treaty of Rome,notably those of foreign affairs and defence.    Before the Rome meetingof the Western European Union (WEU) v/e agreed with the Five onobjectives of procedure and substance.    We are now trying to carrythis process forward and it remains to be seen v/hat action the Fivewill be willing to take and how many of them we can carry with us.
The NATO Ministerial Meeting, 14th-l6th November8.       Our efforts to increase European collaboration within NATO andto make progress on the Harmei initiative are now proceeding in parallel.We shall be holding meetings designed to make further progress in bothspheres in the margin of the NATO Ministerial meeting in a few days1time: -(a) The Secretary of State for Defence will, if all goes well, be meetinghis opposite numbers from the Five and Denmark and Norway.    (TheFrench Defence Minister has been asked but is not expected to attend).The aim will be to reach agreement that the Permanent representatives at NATO should thereafter jointly produce a paper embodying an agreedEuropean view on NATO&apos;s needs for the next few years for discussionwith the next American Administration.    This will not be easy.    we need to be careful, if we are to carry all our partners with us, not to appear to divide NATO or to give an anti-American impression.    Theimportant feature of the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s plan is that itwould be the first occasion on which the European members of the Alliancehad discussed major policy issues together as a group.    further discussions with the Defence Ministers are planned to take place before anything is actually discussed with the Americans.(b) I will, it is hoped, be meeting with the Five to discuss workin the period leading up to the next WEU meeting in January.    our aim will be to prepare the ground on the basis of Harmel&apos;s proposalsso that, when Ministers meet in January in WEU, the points for decision will be clear.After the Brussels Meeting9.       For the time being i it will be best for the two approaches toproceed in parallel: practical defence co-operation going on in NATOwhile consultation on political matters and overall co-ordination takes place in or around WEU.    If we are successful at Brussels, there willbe much useful work to be done in each forum.    We see no reason v/hythere should be any conflict between the objectives we are trying to achieve in each case.    We shall try to avoid discussing the creationof institutions in this period.    If, in the end, some form of secretariatis to be established with the Five as part of the machinery for politicalconsultation on the subjects proposed by M. Harmei, this would be a framework into which we could, at a later stage, insert some defencesubjects if we wanted to do so.M.S.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S, W,l,8th November, I960
