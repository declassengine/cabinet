SECRET r, -/annex BNUCLEAR ENERGY;   CIVIL APPLICATIONSCesCgnt^uge Deyelo1.     The gas centrifuge process is one of several methods of producing enriched uranium which have been known from an early stage in the development of nuclear energy.    But it was not the first to be developed for use on an industrial scale.     The gaseous diffusion methodis the only one developed on this scale in the USA, and France and it isthe method used in our own enrichment plant at Capenhurst.    Bothprocesses may be in use in the USSR and China.2.     Natural Uranium contains 0,7 per cent of the valuable U235isotope;   the remainder being the U238 isotope.    The gaseous diffusionprocess separates these isotopes by diffusion of a gaseous uranium corn-pound through a barrier; this is a relatively low-efficiency processrequiring a large number of barriers in a plant, leading to high capital cost and a large consumption of electricity.    Such a plant necessarilycovers a very large area.     The gas centrifuge process separates theisotopes of uranium by centrifugal force.     This is a relatively high-efficiency process and thus a gas centrifuge plant requires fewer stagesand consumes substantially less electricity.    It can thus be operatedeconomically on a much smaller scale.3.     The principles involved in the gas centrifuge process have been known for a very long time but it is only since the publication, in I960,of a new design concept that there has seemed any prospect that theprocess as applied to a gaseous uranium compound might be operated with reasonable economy,    Early this year, following progress reported by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), a working party under the Chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser was convinced of the technical feasibility of producing enriched uranium on alarge scale by means of the gas centrifuge.    They were further convincedthat, subject to confirmatory work to be completed, the gas centrifugewould enable enriched uranium to be produced in this country more cheaply than by extending the gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst,    TheWorking Party&apos;s investigation was carried out primarily in the context of producing uranium enriched to less than 5 per cent in the &quot;235&quot; content(low enrichment), to meet the nuclear reactor requirements of ourexpanding civil nuclear power programme, but there would be no technicaldifficulty in adapting the centrifuge process to produce the much more highly enriched uranium required for nuclear weapons or submarinereactors.4.      The advance in centrifuge technology in recent years stemmednot only from general technological advances but also from a paperpublished by a repatriated German scientist, Zippe.    He, as a memberof a large team, worked on this subject while captive in the Soviet Union.After his release, he worked in the USA in 195 9 and i960.    The publica-tion of his paper stimulated unclassified work in a number of countries,including Holland and Germany, and in I960 the USA suggested an informal understanding between Holland, Germany, the USA and ourselves-1-
to classify technical details of the work in this field in each country.The understanding then adopted is still in operation.    The type of gascentrifuge which we know to have been under development in the USA upto 1965, and the type which we are presently developing, have evolveddirectly from the design principles described by Zippe.5.     Dutch and German evaluations of the feasibility of the centrifugeprocess and their cost forecasts are widely known to many european governments, having been made available to a European Forum ofindustrialists in nuclear energy (FORATOM).    Published reportsemanating from Holland and Germany have increasingly directed public attention to the centrifuge method of enriching uranium, and as a seriouscompetitor to the diffusion method.    The annual reports of the UKAEAhave been reticent about United Kingdom progress.6.     Against this background it appeared opportune to investigatewhether our own advances in the gas centrifuge field, backed by our existing capacity for enriching uranium by the diffusion method, sffereda chance of co-operating on a European basis in gas centrifuge develop-ment, and in the actual production of enriched uranium for a rapidly growing European market.    If this proved possible we should then havethe benefit of the best technological work in the countries concerned,Holland, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as the bestopportunity for enhanced markets in Europe.    Moreover, we would beable to maintain much closer contact v/ith German work in this field andthis opportunity alone offered a significant advantage in the context ofthe Non-Proliferation Treaty.     Consequently, after exchanges in very&apos;general terms between the Foreign Secretary on the one hand and theNetherlands and German Foreign Ministers on the other, preliminarybilateral discussions were arranged between British officials and dutch and German officials.    These led to the first tripartite meeting of officials about a month ago which prepared an agenda for the tripartiteMinisterial Meeting which took place on 25th. November, 1968.7.     In the first bilateral contact between Dutch and British officials inthe summer it was clear that the Dutch were favourably impressed by our plans for exploiting the gas centrifuge process, and were disposed toconsider Anglo/Dutch collaboration in gas centrifuge development.     Theytold us that they were already in contact with the Germans on thepossibility of bilateral collaboration with them.      In the first Anglo/German discussion, at official level, the Germans were also impressed.Indeed they were surprised, because during the previous two years theyhad been engaging in discussions with the UKAEA about possibilities ofjointly exploiting the capacity of our diffusion plant at Capenhurst for theproduction of enriched uranium for civil nuclear power developments.Like the Dutch, the Germans were interested in full and effectivecollaboration in all phases of centrifuge development and production ofenriched uranium by this process; they were not interested in collabora-tion on the basis of a mere exchange of technical information.8.     These separate meetings with Dutch and German officialsestablished that possibilities for useful collaboration existed;  but that ifthese were to be further pursued, the next step must be a meeting ofMinisters.    That meeting took place in The Hague on 25th November.So far no information about gas centrifuge technology has been exchanged,and the discussions have taken place on a classified basis.-2-
9.      The United States Government were told what we had in mindbefore the first bilateral talks, and given an opportunity to comment.Since then they have been kept continuously informed of developncentOoThe Main Issues10.     Consideration of the gas centrifuge, and more particularly ofthe possibility of collaboration on its exploitation with other countries,has throughout been based on a continuing analysis of certain keyissues, namely the balance of economic advantage; and the relationship of any collaboration to our broad approach to Emrope, to our non-proliferation policy, to our relations with the Federal Republic ofGermany, and to our relations with the United States.Our Approachj^Ej^ope11.     The establishment of collaborative arrangements with theNetherlands and Germany (and perhaps other Western european countries, though this would almost certainly have to be at a later stage ) is important in the context of our approach to Europe.    We haveleant heavily, in pressing our European cause, on the claim that we havea major technological contribution to make.    Our friends in Europe donot regard this as a self-evident proposition, and they look to us to give some concrete proof of our claim.12.     Despite our efforts, we ha,ve so far achieved little or no success in technological collaboration in Europe.    A hopeful area in which to look for collaborative initiative is in the provision of enriched uranium^which is crucial in the development of Europe&apos;s nuclear powerprogamme.    The desire of the European countries to avoid dependence on United States sources of supply has given this issue a major political significance.     Progress in centrifuge technology in Britain, theNetherlands and Germany has created an opportunity to meet this needby a collaborative venture.    If this political opportunity is to be fullyexploited, our aims must be; first, to get effective collaborativearrangements working quickly;  second, to see that those arrangements are as wide as possible in the scope of activities covered; and third, toextend them if possible to friendly European countries other than theNetherlands and the Federal Republic, especially Italy.    It is alreadyclear that we may have to choose, to some extent, between these aims,13.     The mere holding of the first Ministerial meeting in The Haguehas already made a considerable impression.    It has enabled us,together with the Dutch and Germans, to seize the initiative in this fieldfrom the French.    A week earlier, the French Minister of scientific research, speaking in the National Assembly about the need for a european uranium enrichment plant said:-&quot;The plant will use a proved French process, to which none of our partners have contributed in the development stage.Besides, European industry is not within range of producing at a price as low as the American price, andthe building of a communal plant demands that the Sheexpress the clear intention to avail themselves of anindependent production capacity, based on the Frenchprocess.    The question ,      is in the forefront of ourpreoccupations, and I think there will be a decision inthe course of the next few months&quot;.-3-
The talks at The Hagtie, however, showed that the Dutch and germans were willing to work out collaborative arrangements as a matter ofgreat importance and to take a firm line in dealing with any protestsabout non-participation from their European partners, including theFrench.    K we likewise show a clear determination to press ahead,the prospects of success in the negotiations are good; but, from the standpoint of our approach to Europe, if at this stage we were to drawback, after ourselves taking the initiatve and pressing the other two toconsider a tripartite project, our posture as a prospective partner intechnological projects would be seriously weakened.Non- Proliferation14.      Any consideration of the non-proliferation aspects of gascentrifuge collaboration must start from the fact that the Dutch and germans have plainly made substantial progress in the developmentof the centrifuge.    Unless and until we reach the point of exchangingwith them information about the actual designs of our respectivecentrifuge machines, no reliable comparison can be made between the positions reached in each country.    But it is clear, from what theDutch and Germans have told us of their rate of investment in thecentrifuge, which has been fully borne out by evidence from other sources, that both countries - and especially the Netherlands - are confident of their ability to make a commercial success of the newprocess; and that they would go ahead in its development, singly ortogether, whatever we may finally decide about participation in acollaborative venture.15.     In short whatever we do, they are now developing a capabilityto produce enriched uranium.    This capability could be extended toproduce material for use in weapons if they so wished.     In this fieldfinancial considerations would be secondary.    But there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that either country is in fact thinking interms of making nuclear weapons; quite the contrary.    The Dtifcchhave already signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which commitsnon-nuclear-weapon States party to it not to manufacture nuclear weapons, and provides for international safeguards to verify the fulfil -ment of this obligation^    The Germans have not yet signed the Treaty;but the evidence is that they will do so.    The countries members ofthe European Atomic Pool (EURATOM) have made it clear that they willwithhold ratification until their proposed negotiations with the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (idea)provide a clear, answer as to how-safeguards would be applied.    But there is no reason to think that either the Dutch or the Germans would withhold ratification once thispoint had been cleared.    Meanwhile, Germany is bound by her under-taking under the revised Brussels Treaty not to manufacture nuclear weapons on her territory.     Both German and Dutch Ministers drew attention, at fee Hague meeting, to the need to ensure that anycollaborative arrangements would be consistent with the policies of thethree governments in relation to non-proliferation, and to their inter-national obligations in this field.     Britain has of course ratified theNPT.     Before this was done, the Attorney General advised on the implications of ratification in respect of collaboration with european countries on the gas centrifuge.    He took the view that the Treatypresented no bar to collaboration, but that our obligations under itwould require us to insist on the inclusion in any collaborative arrange-ments of certain provisions relating to Non-Proliferation and safeguards.-4-
16.     Though we expect both Germany and the Netherlands to be partyto the NPT in time, they will not ratify the treaty, as mentioned above,until the ETJRATOM safeguards negotiations with the idea have been concluded.    This is unlikely to occur in less than 18 months and could take longer.     During this period, some countries may consider thatthere is a risk of Germany using uranium enriched by the centrifugeprocess for nuclear weapons purposes.    No enriched uranium madeby this process is likely to be available until some two to three years afterthe inception of a collaborative venture.    During this period the germans will, however, have had access to United Kingdom and Dutch technologywhich might or might not improve their own capacity to go it alone.Any theoretical risk to non-proliferation in relation to Germany will bemuch reduced, however, if there are collaborative arrangements ofsuch a nature that we are in a position to keep a close check on what isbeing done in Germany.    Moreover, we may be able to make use of thespecial relationship we shall be establishing with the Germans to putgentle and discreet pressure on them to sign the Treaty sooner ratherthan later.    From the non-proliferation angle, therefore, there ispositive advantage in collaborating with European countries, particularlyGermany.17.     The reason why we have hitherto been reticent in publicising thework of the UKAEA on the gas centrifuge, as mentioned in paragraph 5above, was that, given the fact that the Authority are already operatinga large diffusion plant, such publicity would have given earlier encourage-ment to the belief that development of the gas centrifuge on a large scalewas a practicable possibility.    The gas centrifuge method, because itcan be operated on the basis of small plants, increases opportunities forclandestine enrichment of uranium, and to that extent might causeanxiety about the effectiveness of the NPT and thus delay its conclusions and coming into force.    We had therefore hoped that it would be possibleto keep our progress dark until the NPT was in force.    Delays over theNPT have upset this timetable.    We are now in a position where, evenif there were no question of collaboration with other countries, we shouldshortly have to take decisions about the use of the gas centrifuge process to meet our needs for enriched uranium which would inevitably have been difficult to conceal.18,     It is right that we should reflect with particular care before embarking on collaboration with Germany in a sensitive nuclear field.But we must also satisfy ourselves that we are giving due weight to thepolitical factors favouring such collaboration.    If it be true that our approach to Europe cannot succeed without French acquiescence, it islikewise true that, without German   support, it is bound to fail.    Wehave constantly claimed to treat Germany as an equal partner in inter-national affairs;  but in practice she is not entirely equal.    For example,she accepted, under the revised Brussels Treaty, obligations limitingher freedom of action in relation not only to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, but also to other important military questions.     For the last ten years, this type of de facto discrimination has perhaps not matteredvery much.    The Germans have accepted that their behaviour in the1930s and 40s has placed them in a special position.    But new generationsare now gaining influence in Germany which feel no personal responsibility
for those events, and which are increasingly looking to other countries,especially European countries, to treat Germany as a genuinely equalpartner.     if we are to wean the Germans away from their excessivepreoccupation with their relations with the French, and establish a stronger claim to their support, we shall have to show ourselves moreunderstanding of their aspirations than are the French.Our Relations with the UnitedjStetes19.     Our relations with the United States carry with them certain legal and political constraints.     When the question of collaboration with european countries was first substantively considered by Ministers inApril, the Attorney General was asked about the nature of any suchlegal constraints.     His attention was drawn to:(a) the Anglo/United States (intergovernmental) Agreement for collaboration on the Civil Uses of Atomic Energy which runsuntil 1975, and the agreed Anglo/United States classificationguide ope rated thereunder,    (a set of rules for securityprocedures on nuclear questions);(b) an understanding between the Governments of the UnitedStates, Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and theNetherlands, which in effect provided for the application in each of the four countries of security procedures inrelation to gas centrifuge work which are substantiallyidentical with those contained in the Anglo/United Statesclassification guide.20.     The Attorney General confirmed that the Quadripartite Understanding,which was contained in a series of unpublished minutes of meetings andwas in no sense a formal international agreement, was not binding inmore than a political sense.     As regards the Anglo/United StatesAgreement, he gave it as his opinion that:-(i)   if at any stage during the proposed discussions with theDutch (or of course the Germans) we were to discloseto them information relating to one particular part ofour centrifuge machine, the design of which derived tosome extent from information received, under (a) above,from the Americans, we would have difficulty in resisting an American allegation that the disclosure wasin breach of the Agreement^(ii)   moreover, if there were any intention to publish theinformation in question, this would constitute a furtherbreach.
21,       The Attorney-General found no other legal constraints.    Hecommented, however, that collaboration with the Americans had beenlong maintained on a basis of mutual trust;  that this appeared to havegiven rise to common practices designed to safeguard the secrecy of nuclear information exchanged under the Agreement and that it wouldbe a serious matter to take any steps in breach of that mutual trust.It was accepted by Ministers at the time that there was nothing in the attorney-General&apos;s opinion to prevent us from entering into confidential discussions with the Dutch /or the Germans,/ about possibilities for collaboration, so long as we did not over-step the limitation described in (i) above.    This is still the case,22.      So far as the Anglo-United States classification guide itself isconcerned, there is the point that, if collaboration leads to a requirement to declassify gas centrifuge technology, in whole or in part, we should be bound by the Anglo-United States Agreement to consult the Americans beforeso doing;  but we should not be legally prevented from such a change afterconsultations, even in the face of American objections.    The difficulties about so doing would be political, not legal.    The same considerations apply a fortiori to the Quadripartite Memorandum of Understanding,23.      The political constraints on our freedom of action could be expectedto reside in the effects which any row with the United States might have onour bilateral arrangements with them for the supply of enriched uraniumfor our civil programme, and on the Anglo-United States Agreement for,Co-operation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposesof 1958 (as amended).24.      The Americans have been kept fully informed of the development ofour thinking on gas centrifuge collaboration, and on the related questionof the classification of gas centrifuge technology.    Before speaking to theDutch or Germans, we warned them that we were thinking of exploringthe possibilities of collaboration.    The American reaction, which wasconveyed to us by the State Department in writing, was that they regardeddiscussion of such questions as &quot;natural and appropriate&quot; and consideredthat decisions on them &quot;are of course ones to be made by the Europeansthemselves&quot;.    The Americans took note of an assurance we had given thatwe should, in discussions with other Governments, take into account theprovisions of the Anglo-United States Agreement for collaboration on theCivil Uses of Atomic Energy.    They also said that the provisions of the classification guide ielating to the gas centrifuge should be reviewed toconsider the extent to which they continued to be realistic.25.      We subsequently sent the Americans a memorandum on the latter point.    The memorandum recognised that the development of gascentrifuge technology presented problems in relation to non-proliferation.It said that if the development could have been arrested, or if it could have been confined to only two or three countries, classification might stillbe justifiable.    But neither of these conditions appeared to exist.    It-7-
seemed, therefore, that it would not be possible to maintain the classification of centrifuge technology, and that it should be declassifiedover a period of time.    A reply since received from the Americans statedthat, while they remain ready to review certain provisions of the classification guide, they felt that any broad declassification of gascentrifuge technology would be unwise.    However, they would re-examinetheir overall policies in this field, and would welcome talks with us atofficial level.26.      The first round of talks will take place on 5th-6th December in washington.    It is reasonable to assume that, while this will be helpful in clarifying the reasons which have led both sides to adopt their views,neither side will make any substantial alteration in its position.    In the longer term events are likely to induce the Americans to agree to some relaxation of declassif publication policy over a period, but the timing and extent of any such relaxation cannot now be predicted.    So far as our proposed collaboration with the Dutch and Germans is concerned, weshould, for the time being, be able to continue negotiations or development work on the basis of the security rules laid down in the presentclassification guide.    The problem is not, therefore, pressing,27.     The question of co-operation on nuclear defence issues is a difficult one.    This co-operation takes place under the terms of the United States/United Kingdom Agreement for Co-operation for Mutual Defence (1958).Although the Americans could theoretically terminate the Agreement bythe end of 1969 we believe they are in fact unlikely to do so.    But theycould allow exchanges of information, material and components relatingto current nuclear weapons matters to wither away, as has been the case for information concerning their new nuclear weapons.    As regards theprovision of enriched nuclear fuel for submarine propulsion, theUnited States Administration has recently agreed, subject to Congressionalapproval, which will remain uncertain until March, 1969, to extend the relevant provisions of the Agreement for a further ten years.    There istherefore a risk that, if we upset the Americans in the nuclear field, this could affect the attitude of Congress or the new Administration and leadto this proposed extension not being ratified.    Assuming that this extensionwere to be ratified, we may need to exercise the option it gives us topurchase enriched uranium for naval nuclear propulsion to tide over a gapbefore any supply of such material could be available from United Kingdomsources.28.     As regards our civil nuclear power programme, we may wish to request, under the Agreement on the Civil Uses of Atomic Energy, supplyof some enriched uranium, in the event that sources of supply, either froma United Kingdom Plant or a joint plant, are not available in time to meetthe Electricity Generating Boards1 civil power programmes.29.      To sum up on the American aspect.    In the course of the Governmentreview of foreign policy last February, it was recognised and agreed thatEurope was now the centre of our foreign policy and we agreed that it was ofthe utmost importance to give substance to proposals for partnership withEui ropean countries.    Nuclear energy is plainly an important field for thedevelopment of such proposals.    But it is also one in which, for a quarterof a century, we have had close association with the Americans.    It is inevitable that, as we now move to broaden our connections with Europe,there will be occasions when what we have in mind will carry clearimplications for our relations with the United States.    This is the firstsuch occasion and it is right that it is examined with particular care..&apos; -8-
Commercial Issues30.      In collaboration with others we would hope to obtain substantialcommercial benefits.    These Include: better and wider marketingprospects, subject to paragraph 31 (below) for both centrifuges and enricheduranium, and so a more competitive price;  a greater and more continuousscale of production of centrifuges, leading to lower prices of both the machines and their product, enriched uranium; and a larger and morediverse development effort for the improvement of centrifuges, whichcould be sustained by the greater turnover and resources of a joint venturethan any we could manage ourselves, and could add to our joint ability tokeep a jump ahead of our other competitors.    We would also expect thatthe collaborative venture as a whole would benefit from the research anddevelopment (R &amp; D) work already done by the three partners independently.There are of course also disadvantages which often affect international ormultilateral projects.    These arise partly from the extra organisationalcomplexity of the project, from vague and imperfectly agreed objectives and from too inflexible efforts, under political pressure or otherwise tomaintain a balance of expenditure in each participating countrycommensurate with its contribution.    These elements can all lead toinefficiency and so to higher costs, but each with care can be much reduced if the running of the organisation approximates as closely as possible tothat of an international industrial consortium and Government interventionis kept to a minimum consistent with our international obligations.31.      In order to ensure that the advantages of collaboration on centrifugeproduction and exploitation are not outweighed by the disadvantages, it willbe of the utmost importance to ensure that the manufacturing organisationsoperate in a strictly commercial environment, disciplined by the requirement to face American competition, both in centrifuges and inenriched uranium production.    This need for commercial strength and ability to face competition is strongly endorsed by both Dutch and Germans.The actual commitment of markets in the countries of the partners is notsomething on which it is yet possible to be definite.    It is on the wholeperhaps easier for us to do this than for the Dutch or Germans most of whose utilities are private enterprises.    At the same time it may bepossible to encourage utilities to support the &quot;home&quot; product and tariffscan perhaps be adjusted, certainly for a transitional period - e,g. untilthe joint venture achieves commercial viability.    Moreover countries could in effect commit their markets by undertaking to buy a given numberof centrifuges rather than a given quantity of enriched uranium.    The mainrisk is of &quot;dumping&quot; by the Americans.    It may be possible to agree on measures to prevent this.32.      There may be profits to be made from sales to non-participantsand from licensing;  their extent cannot be indicated before arrangementsfor declassifying centrifuge technology - or otherwise dealing with theproblem - have been agreed among all the parties concerned, and untiladequate safeguarding practices have been worked out.33.      While certain advantages might flow from the incorporation of othercountries in the proposed collaboration, notably from the increased market and from their expertise in engineering, it is clear from the last meetingat The Hague on 25th November that in the short term the possibility of bringing in even Italy is slight.    This aspect of future possibilities, while not to be neglected in the long run, is therefore not further considered inthe commercial or financial sense.
Financial Issues34,      In order to meet United Kingdom requirements for enricheduranium, the UKAEA will in any event have to invest in further enrichmentcapacity.    Until recently the Authority have been planning to extend the capacity of the diffusion plant at Capehhurst.    The AuthorityTs five yearforecast of expenditure for the years 1969-74 stated that, for Capenhurst,the cost of the erection of the authorised first stage of the expansionwould be  14.4 million.    This is already in handi    The further expansionplanned, for which it is now intended to substitute centrifuges, would havecost  65 million beginning during the years 1968-71.    The financial implications of switching from diffusion technology to centrifugetechnology are hard to quantify exactly as this stage.    But the expert advice available is firm that the substitution of centrifuge for gaseousdiffusion installations would represent a considerable saving on that figure.35.      It is, however, impossible at this stage to give reliable indications of the costs or other financial implications of developing and exploitingcentrifuge technology in collaboration with others, when the nature of the institutions, the precise extent of collaboration and of our share in it andthe relative degrees of technical advance, have not yet been determined.If we succeed in establishing a commercial organisation on the linesdescribed at paragraph 30 above, we should expect a collaborative venture to be at least as successful as the domestic alternative.    It must berecognised, however, that the necessity for some degree of Governmentsupervision and intervention may militate against this outcome.36.     A substantial capital amount will, of course, be needed from thepartners at the start.    Bearing in mind that our own requirements forenriched uranium are the most ^^rgent (in fact we are first in the queue),in the early stages we might find that what we get out of the joint venturewould be at a lesser immediate capital cost to ourselves than if we wereto proceed alonej this is on the reasonable assumption that capital costs will be shared.    At a later stage, when German and Dutch requirements have built up, our contribution might offset this initial advantage, but theeffect will be a spread of the costs over a longer period of time.    Thenet effect of these influences should be that we should pay by way of capitalcontribution less than if we did the job alone, and that this contribution,because centrifuge installations can be economically set up on a more modest scale than diffusion plants, and because the initial requirementsvary from partner to partner, will be spread over a longer period of time.37.     Using United Kingdom costs as a basis, it has been tentativelyestimated that the capital cost of the manufacture of centrifuges and ofenrichment plants to meet the requirements of the three partners up to1975 would be as follows:-  millionUp to 1972 71973 281974 131975 53Total 101-10-
Of this total approximately two-fifths would represent the cost of centrifuges.The United Kingdom share of this capital expenditure cannot be determinedat this stage.    The arrangements for subscription to the capital of theorganisation remain to be negotiated.    Discussions so far suggest that a one-third share for each partner might be negotiable.    It is not yet clear what the respective roles of Governments and the private sector will bein the provision of capital, but it should not be assumed that the whole ofthe finance for what is hoped to be a profitable undertaking will fall onGovernments,38.     As experience has shown, the actual cost of complicatedtechnological projects frequently exceeds the original estimates.    Inpartnerships involving several countries and their Governments the riskof cost escalation is greater.    Usually, however, most of the escalationof costs can be pinned down to the research and especially the developmenteffort.    For this reason, it would be desirable to insist that nationalR&amp;D efforts in the centrifuge field should be integrated into the commercialorganisation and financed by it, so that the external commercial pressurestending to discipline the R&amp;D effort towards improved competitive andtechnical performance in the open market would play their part.39.      To sum up, we are unable yet to compare exactly the cost of meeting our own requirements on a national basis with that of doing so in collaboration with others.    But it may be said that we can only secure aneconomical result from a collaborative effort if it is conducted upon a strictly commercial basis - with which our proposed partners agree - andif our contribution to the joint venture is kept to the minimum, commensurate with our equality of rights.    These therefore must be among the objectives of further negotiations.The agreed minutes of the tripartite meeting; at The Hague on25th November40.     At the Ministerial meeting v/ith the Dutch and Germans at The Hagueon 25th November, we reached agreement with them., ad referendum to governments, on certain basic principles on which collaboration on the exploitation of the gas centiifuge could be established.    These wererecorded in agreed minutes (copy attached).    The Dutch and germans have told us that they would have been prepared to commit their Governmentsdefinitively, there and then, on all matters covered in the agreed minutes,if we had been in a position to do the same.41.      V/e have the following comments on the agreed minutes:(a)    Principle No. 5This provides that a suitable institutional framework for theco-operation should be set up on the basis of &quot;equality of rights&quot;.This phrase was not defined.    Although discussion on theestablishment of the institutional framework reached no clearconclusions, it seems probable that a two-tier structure will emerge, with a governmental body and an industrial organisation.At the governmental level, there is likely to be an inter-governmental agreement which might contain the basicundertakings of collaborating countries, including undertakings
about safeguards, and provide for the establishment of a supervisory-political body of some kind.    The principle of &quot;equality of rights1&apos;would presumably result in each Government having equal votingrights in that body.    At the industrial level there will probablybe an international consortium, with Dutch, German and Britishconstituents.    We would wish this organisation to be able to pursuea commercial policy with the minimum of intervention by thepolitical supervisory body.    The British constituent would initiallybe the sea, and subsequently the Nuclear Fuel Corporation.It is not clear how the principle of &quot;equality of rights&quot; would apply in this context;  or how account would be taken of any differences in the contributions that were being made by the participating countries in relation to technology, finance or commitment of markets.    This would be a key part of the neogiations.Principle No. 6Thio provides for participation in the results of exploitation of the gas centrifuge process to be open to other countries.    Thislikewise was not defined.    Before the meeting, we had told theItalians that we would put to the Germans and Dutch the case forItalian participation in any collaborative arrangements.Meanwhile, however, the Germans and Dutch had told theirEUBATOM partners, including the Italians, that they would beable to participate &quot;in the results of exploitation&quot;;  they have actually told the Italians that they would not be able to participate in design and development work from the start.    At the meetingthey told us that, if the Italians were admitted, they could hardlyresist claims for admission from the Belgians or even the French.If accepted, these claims would result in the negotiations becomingbogged down.    In short, we had to choose between pressing theItalian claim and securing rapid progress towards centrifugecollaboration.    We decided that this dilemma was a real one and that, on balance, the advantage lay in rapid progress.    Thispresents us with an awkward problem of disengagement vis-a-vis the Italians; but it seemed to be the less of two evils.Principle No. 7Attention is drawn to the readiness of the Dutch and Germans togive firm undertakings, at the outset, about the necessity for anycollaborative arrangement to be consistent with the policies ofthe three Governments on non-proliferation and with theirinternational obligations in this field.    There is explicit mention of the need for appropriate international safeguards.    agreement on this principle was reached without any difficulty.-12-
secret247APPENDIXGAS QENTRIFUGTi,&apos; COLLABORATIONAgreed Minutes of a meeting between Dutch,Gexman andJBridjdsh Ministers held in Thejia ue&quot; on 25th &quot;NovembTrTT^58, &apos;JlMg^wegejajfo^ referendum to governments,     The Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany,,the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland andthe Kingdom of the Netherlands regard the supply of enricheduranium for purposes other than the manufacture of nuclear weapons as a matter of great importance.   To meet growing needsadditional enrichment capacity will have to be created. Witha view to further diversifying the sources of supply, theGovernments consider it desirable that Western Europe shouldpossess a substantial enrichment capacity.2.     The Governments believe that the result of experimentswith the gas centrifuge method and its present stage ofdevelopment in their respective countries are such that this method is the most suitable for the expansion of western europe&apos;s enrichment capacity.3.     With a view to applying this method on an industrial and commercial scale with the least possible delay and expense,the Governments have decided to cooperate in the endeavour:they will do so under arrangements to he determined laterbut which will rest on the following principles.U.     Cooperation will include further research and development,as well as the manufacture of equipment for the separation ofisotopes and the operation of enrichment plants on an industrial and commercial basis.5.     A suitable institutional framework for the cooperationwill be set up on the basis of equality of rights.6. Participation in the results of exploitation of the gascentrifuge process will be open to other countries, providedsuch participation is to the advantage of all concerned.7.     Any cooperative arrangement will have to be consistent with the policies of the three Governments in relation to theNon Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which they attachextreme importance, and to their international obligations inthis field.    It is therefore the intention to apply appropriate international safeguards to these arrangements.Secret
