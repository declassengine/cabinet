427DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 13fch December the Home Affairs Committee considered aproposal by the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of racial Discrimination before the end of the year, subject to a reservationto cover our Commonwealth immigration legislation.    At Home affairs had to reserve my position on the need for this reservation.    Accordingly,it was announced in a Written Answer on 19th December that we hoped to bein a position to deposit the instruments of ratification early in the New Year,and I now seek the views of my colleagues on the question of the reservation.2.       The suggestion that a reservation might be necessary arises on article l(l) of the Convention which defines &quot;racial discrimination&quot; aa any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour,descent or national or ethnic origin v/hich has the purpose or effect ofnullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political,economic, social, cultural, or any other field of public lifej  and, inparticular, from Article 5(d)(ii) under which States undertake to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment ofthe following rights .... &quot;... The right to leave any country, IncludingoneTs own, and to return to oneTs country&quot;.3.       The proposal before Home Affairs was that our ratification shouldbe subject to a reservation that Her Majestyts Government &quot;do not regard the Commonwealth^Immigrants Acts, 1962^and 1968, or their application,as involving any /breach of the Convention/ and fully reserve their rightto continue to apply those Acts&quot;,    In brief the arguments for enteringthis reservation are that if we were to ratify without a reservation,, andif a formal complaint by a State were considered by the Committee whichwill in due course be set up to Implement the Convention, or by theInternational Court of Justice, there would be a risk that theCommonwealth Immigrants Act, 1968 might be said to be incompatible with the Convention.    This would leave us with the alternatives ofrescinding or modifying the Act, or denouncing the Convention by giving a yearns notice under Article 21.    The memorandum by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs did not suggest that the riskC(68) 132COPY NO,31st December, 1968CABINET-1-
of such a complaint being made was great, and brought out the point thatif a complaint were made there would be a whole range of possibilities for settlement short of the stark alternatives of our having to modify ourlegislation or denounce the Convention,    From the making of a complaintor, in the final resort, a decision by the International Court, the wholeprocedure is estimated to take afc least three years.4.       Ratification with the reservation proposed would no doubt provideus with the best protection against future embarrassment under theConvention (unless it were itself declared incompatible v/ith theConvention by the formal objection under Article 20 of two-thirds of theStates who were parties);  but in my view It would be wrong to enter anyreservation.    The possibility that the Commonwealth Immigrants Act,1968 might create difficulties for us in relation to this Convention wasforeseen from the outset.    The Attorney-General circulated a paper(C(68) 36) to Cabinet which was considered on 15th February(CC(68) 13th Conclusions).    In it he said:-  &quot;In the case of theConvention on Racial Discrimination we can argue that the proposed legislation is based on criteria of territorial connection with theUnited Kingdom and does net discriminate on grounds of race, colouror national or ethnic origin&quot;.    The minutes record the Attorney-general as saying that our position in relation to this and other international agreements and declarations would be &quot;difficult but not impossible&quot;.5.       The relevance of the Bill to our existing and prospectiveobligations under international instruments was hardly referred to in the debates on the Bill.    But the extension of immigration control to united Kingdom passport holders not having a close connection with theUnited Kingdom was misrepresented as a racially discriminatorymeasure.    This we have firmly and consistently denied.    I said in theHouse (Official Report; 27th February, 1968, column 1251)s   &quot;It has beensuggested that this is a racialist conception.    That is not so.    It is truethat Clause 1 does not apply to Australian or New Zealand or Canadiancitizens because all of them are already subject to control.    The test thatis adopted Is geographical nor racial.    Those who, or whose fathers orfathers1 fathers were born, naturalised, adopted cr registered in theUnited Kingdom will be exempted whatever their race.     . . , . It is a wildexaggeration to refer to this legislation as racialist&quot;.    But if we nowexpressly reserve our position under the Commonwealth Immigrants Acts,in ratifying this Convention, we shall be going out of our way to invite the criticism that v/e ourselves reognise that our legislation is open tolegitimate attack on grounds of discrimination.    To draw attention to thematter by entering a reservation is to Invite a re-opening of the issue,and would be inconsistent with the firm line that we have hitherto taken.And to cover the Act of 1962 also in the reservation seems quiteunjuscifiable.    It is the maintenance of our Commonwealth immigration control on a non-discriminatory basis that causes us such embarrassmentwith Australia and New Zealand from time to time.6.       In my view the better course, and the one with which I invite mycolleagues to agree, is to ratify the Convention without any reservation,and as the Minister responsible for immigration I am prepared to acceptthe consequences of this.    If our legislation is challenged, we shall rely on the arguments that satisfied us that it was not discriminatory.-2-

Mea.nwh.ile, with the agreement of the Secretary of State for foreign.nd Commonwealth Affairs, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man havebeen informed of Her Majesty^s Governments proposal to ratify theConvention (which would impose obligations on them) and their formal agreement sought, with a view to ratification not later than the end ofJanuary, 1969.li- j0 C,Home Office, 3.V/.1.31st December, 1968-3-CCMHQEHliAL
