POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BOARDSNote by the Prime minister on 1st April, 1947, the Cabinet approved a statement (OP. (47) 96) of theprinciples which should govern participation in national and local politics bymembers and staffs of the Boards of socialised industries. They agreed that astatement of these principles should be communicated to the Chairmen of the boards; and I attach (Annex I) a copy of the statement which was sent to the chairmen in pursuance of that decision. A general indication of the Govern-menfs attitude to this question was also given in a statement (Annex II) whichI made in the House of Commons on 1st May, 1947, in reply to questions byMr. Charles Smith, M.P.2. The main object of the broad principles then laid down was to ensurethat the members of the Boards and their senior staffs should establish a tradition of public service irrespective of Party allegiance. At the same time we recognisedthat public life would suffer if all the able men and women associated withsocialised undertakings were debarred from participation in any political activities. We contemplated that the position snould be reviewed later, in thelight of practical experience; and I nave been considering with some of mycolleagues whether further guidance could not now be given on the extent towhich political activities may properly be undertaken by members of theseBoards.3. Any absolute prohibition would bear most hardly on persons who hadbeen appointed to the Boards by reason of past experience acquired in the Labour,Trade Union or Co-operative movements. It is through continuing contacts withtheir past associations that these men and women will be able to make their most effective contribution to the work of their Boards. And, if they are prevented from continuing those contacts and the political activities associated with them,the Labour movement (political and industrial) will be deprived of the servicesof some of its most valuable and responsible supporters.34948&quot; ; printed for the Cabinet.

On the other hand, unrestricted political activity by persons holding suchpublic appointments has obvious dangers. They are in a position to make, orto influence, large numbers of subordinate appointments. And, if their political activities go too far, they will be liable to be removed from their posts on achange of Government. We should be slow to expose ourselves to the risks of a &quot; spoils system &quot; in appointments to the higher posts in the socialised industries. j4. We must therefore seek a middle way. I suggest, for the considerationof the Cabinet, that the political activities of members of the Boards of socialised industries should be governed by the following rules: (a) Members of the Boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should not maintain an active connection with the Party machine of any political party.(b) Subject to (a) above, part-time members should be free to engage in any political activities, provided that they are conscious of their general public responsibility and exercise a proper discretion, particularlyin regard to the work of the Boards of which they are members. on matters affecting that work, they should not normally make politicalspeeches or engage in other political activities.(c) Whole-time members should abstain from controversial political activity.If they are Members of the House of Lords they may take part ingeneral debates in that House; but they should not intervene in debatesinvolving matters of political controversy.(d) Members 01 the Boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should be free to maintain past associations with Trade Unions, Co-operative society-ties, trade associations, &amp;c, to the extent that such associations donot conflict directly with the interests of the Boards to which theybelong.(e) Any member of a Board who is doubtful about the application of these rules, or about the propriety of any political activity, should seekguidance from the Minister responsible for the socialised industry with which he is associated.(/) The foregoing rules apply equally to political activity on behalf of anvof the political Parties.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,17th February, 1948.
ZANNEX public BOARDS: POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF members and  STAFFStatement communicated to Chairmen of Public Boards1. The Boards of socialised industries may find it of assistance to havean indication of the Governmenfs views about the extent to which the members and staffs of these Boards should be free to take part in political activities,national and local.2. Public life would suffer if the many able men and women in the servicesnow being brought under public ownership were debarred from all participation in national and local politics. At the same time, it is the Governmenfs intention that the members of the Boards and their senior staffs should establish aI tradition of public service irrespective of party allegiances. This will naturallyrequire a measure of discretion on their part in political matters. It is clearly desirable that they should refrain from the more controversial forms of political activity.3. As regards candidature for Parliament, members of the Boards ofsocialised industries cannot serve as members of the House of Commons. Seniorstaff should, in the view of the Government, be discouraged from standing ascandidates. Other members of the staff should normally be free to stand for parliament. The terms as to possible re-engagement on which, if elected, they arereleased from their employment will be a matter for the Boards to decide.4. The Prime Minister has already indicated, in reply to Questions in theHouse of Commons (Hansard, 12th March, 1946, Cols. 945-6, and 6th February,1947, Col. 1960) that it is not the Government&apos;s intention that employees of undertakings brought under public ownership and control should be debarred from standing as candidates in local elections or from serving on local councilsif elected. The Government recognises, however that the Board of a socialisedindustry might wish to review the position of an employee who was devoting suchan amount of time to local government activities as to prejudice his efficiencyas an employee.5. This note does no more than indicate the broad principles which, in the government&apos;s view, each of the Boards should apply in developing a code of practice appropriate to the circumstances of its industry. At a latter stage itmay be possible to formulate a more comprehensive statement in the light of experience gained in the practical application of these principles.April 1947
ANNEX IIPUBLIC BOARDS: POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF members and STAFFStatement in House of Commons on 1st May, 1947(Hansard, Cols. 2160-1)45 and 46.   Mr. CHARLES SMITH asked the Prime Minister-(1) whether any guidance has now been given by the Government to nationalised undertakings with regard to the political freedom oftheir staffs; and, in particular, to the right of their staff to hold office in a political party;(2) what restrictions are imposed on the staff of nationalised undertakingswith regard to standing for election to local authorities or toParliament; and whether any guidance has been given by theGovernment on this matter to nationalised undertakings ?THE PRIME MINISTER (Mr. Attlee) : The Government have informed the Boards of the general principles which in their view should govern thedevelopment of a code of practice in this matter. The broad effect of these isthat the vast majority of those employed in our nationalised industries will beas free as those employed in other industries to participate without restriction in political activities, whether national or local. There is, however, one qualificationaffecting only a small number of employees which does not always apply in otherindustries. It is desirable that the senior staffs of the Boards should establish atradition of public service irrespective of party allegiances, and it follows thatthey must exercise a measure of discretion in political matters which will prevent them from engaging in the more controversial forms of political activity.
