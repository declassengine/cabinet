DRAFT STATEMENT-ON PERSONAL INCOMES,  costs and prices. The Government&apos;s economic policy depends largely forits success upon our ability to moke and sell the exportsnecessary to buy the imports we need to feed our people and keep our industry going.      Our costs of production are of vital importance and they depend to a considerable extent onthe amount which industry has to pay in profits, salaries and wages.     These in turn in the form of individual incomesaffect the total volume of money available in relation tothe quantity of goods.     A further factor affecting thesituation is the relationship between personal incomes indifferent occupations.2. As regards costs of production, it was pointed outin the &quot;Statement on the Economic Considerations affectingRelations between Employers and Workers&quot; issued in January,1914-7, with the endorsement of the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil, that &quot;if costs of production and in consequence pricesrise in relation to world prices, it may moke it impossible forus to pay our way in the world and buy all the imports we need&quot;.We shall all suffer as 0 result and it is therefore the dutyof everyone to play his or her part in averting the danger.3. The Government has taken many steps already toprevent the development of a dangerous inflationary situation.But the danger is ever present and will be accentuated by the drive to achieve a balance of payments, which will reduce thetotal volume of goods available on the home market.1+. It is essential therefore that there should be nofurther general increase, in the level of personal incomeswithout at least a corresponding Increase in the volume of annex
production.      Unless we are prepared to check this tendencywe shall find ourselves unable to fulfil our export taskowing to the rise in costs which will also &quot;be reflected inrising prices on the home market.5* Already steps have &quot;been taken by high direct taxation on personal incomes and upon distributed profits to curtailthe amount of profits available for spending.      similarly the rate of interest paid upon the securities issued for thepurchase of the nationalised industries will reduce the amountdistributed annually to those who were formerly shareholdersin those undertakings,  though of course giving them a greatersecurity.      These measures are of assistance in checking thedanger of inflation in respect of personal incomes derivedfrom investments, rents sod profits.6. The same restraining influence has been applied asregards lower scale earned incomes by the introduction ofP.A.Y.E. tax and by the increase of indirect taxation, though this has to some extent been countered by the continuance ofState subsidies in the cases of certain commodities, notably the principal foodstuffs.7. But these measures against inflation cannot.in themselves be conclusive if personal incomes are allowed to risecontinuously s:; as to evade their corrective influence.      Itis obviously of no benefit to any one if the increases in personal incomes are swallowed up by rising prices or have tobe taken away by increased taxation.8. Experience has shown that, in the race between rising prices and personal incomes,  prices will always win in thelong run, so that conditions become progressively worse forthe holders of all personal incomes but particularly forthe lower income classes..
9. It is therefore essential in any consideration of the dangers and evils of inflation to have regard to the movementsthat take place in the general scale of personal incomes.10. Over the last century particular economic considerations hove developed traditional or customaryrelationships between personal incomes in different occupations,which have no necessary relevance to present-day conditions and necessities.      The relation which different personal incomes bear to one another must no longer be determined bythis historiol development of the past, but by the urgentneeds of the moment.      In the changed world of today and withour present economic difficulties these old relationships of income must, for the very sake of our survival, be altered the better to conform to the national interest.      Relativeincome levels must be such as to encourage the movement oflabour to those industries where it is most needed,  and shouldnot,  as in some cases they still do,  tempt it in a contrarydirection.11. In the circumstances detailed above the government feel bound to take the exceptional step of setting out thefollowing general considerations as a guide to all those whosedeliberations and actions contribute to the settlement of theamount of personal incomes, from whatever source.(a)    It is neither possible nor desirable for theGovernment to interfere directly with the income of individuals otherwise than by taxation.      To go further would mean that the Government would be forced itself to assess and regulate all personal incomes according to some scale which would have tobe determined.      This would be on incursion by theGovernment into what has hitherto been regarded asa field of free contract between individuals and organisations.
In the view of the Government it is essential thatthere should be the strictest adherence to theterms of collective agreements.      One of the mainadvantages of a system of collective bargaining isthat it tends to ensure that wage and salarymovements take place in an orderly manner and with due regord to the general as opposed to theindividual interest.      Departure from the agreedconditions by individual employers, whether public authorities or private concerns, will inevitablyconstitute a grave danger to the stability of thesystem of collective bargaining,  and may well leadto competitive bargaining, and this to general butunjustifiable increases in wages and salaries and to serious inflation.      The value of the system of collective bargaining and the justification for itsmaintenance at the present time rest upon theassumption that the terms of collective agreementswill be observed loyally by all employers and workers,  and the Government cannot stress too highlythe importance which they attach to this principle.In present conditions,  and until more goods and services are available for the home market,  there isno justification for any general increase of individual money incomes.      Such an increase will raise costs of production and cannot make more goodsavailable and so can have only on inflationary effect.Unless related to a substantial increase in production,it would drive up prices,  adversely affect pensioners,children and other recipients of social servicesbenefits, increase the money cost of our exports andso reduce their soleability and by black marketpressure make it almost impossible to operate the
controls necessary in view of the continuing scarcity of supplies and manpower,(a)    It does not follow that it would he right to stabiliseall incomes as they stand today.      There may well &quot;becases in which increases in wages or salaries wouldbe justified from a national point of view,  forexample where it is essential in the national interestv to man up a particular undermanned industry and it isclear that only an increase in wages will attract the necessary labour.      It does mean, however, that each claim for an increase in personal incomes mustbe considered on its national merits and not on thebasis of maintaining a farmer relativity as between different occupations and industries,(e)    If there should be a marked rise in the cost of livingthe level of those personal incomes which as a resultbecame inadequate to provide a decent standard ofliving would need reconsideration.12. It will be observed from the above principles thatthere is no justification at the present time for any rise in incomes from profits,  rent,  or other like sources and that rises in wages or salaries should only be asked for and agreed upon inone of the exceptional cases mentioned above.13* In order to avoid the undesirable necessity forinterference with the existing methods of free negotiation andcontract the Government must press upon all those engaged in negotiations or decisions which might result in on increase in personal incomes to keep these principles firmly before them, andnot to depart from them.      The State will itself observe these principles in any negotiations in which it is directly concerned.1Jd. In these circumstances the Government have decidedand wish it to be clearly understood that, if, notwithstandingthese considerations,  remuneration do increased in any class of
employment, whether in private industry or under a public authority, there can be no presumption, whatever may havebeen the practice in the past, that the resulting costs will infuture be taken into account in settling controlled prices,charges or margins or other financial matters requiringGovernment action.      Each case will have to be considered onits merits in relation to the principles enunciated above.15* To sum up, if general increases in individual money incomes take place without more goods being made available,no-one can obtain any real benefit except the block marketoperator;    the rest of the community has to endure the dislocation and hardship which inevitably accompanies inflation.In short,  the alternatives now before us are either a generalagreement by the people to act together upon sound lines ora serious and prolonged set-back in our economic reconstructionaccompanied by a persistent low standard of living.
