O.P.(b,8) 4 .11TH FEBRUARY,  19h8CABINETIQU8 DOLLAR position memorandum by the Minister of food fully recognise  that if Marshall Aid is not forthcoming, we shall have to impose further drastic cutsin food and animal feedings tuff imports involving a bread and potato type of diet as part of the institution of a sort of &quot;state of siege&quot; economy for this country.      This will involve,  as paragraph 14 of the   memorandum attached to theChancellor&apos;s paper :(C.P. (48) 35)  states,  the recasting ofour whole policy, not only in economic matters but also in&quot;defence and foreign affairs&quot;.      I believe the t in such a supreme crisis our people would accept the situation and do their best to maintain output with what food oould be provided.2. Until we know whether we must face this situation it would be wrong, as the memorandum recognises,  to disruptour economy in the violent manner which would then become inevitable.     But! -recognise that it is our duty, irrespective of the outcome of the Marshall Plan discussions,  to take every possible step to save dollars now,  so long as such steps donot involve disastrous consequences.      If my colleagues will turn to Appendix &apos;A&apos;  they will see the nutritional consequences ofthe new food cuts proposed in paragraph 20 of the memorandum.3. My colleagues will see- that -(i)    we are already almost down to the calorie level fore-cast by the Chancellor for the first six months of the year,i.e. we are at 2,730 calories per head per day.     This is inspite of the restoration of 1 oz.  to the bacon and 1 oz.  tothe fats rations.      This indicates that, as I warned mycolleagues,  the real rate which would have been reached hadall the cuts forecast been imposed, with no offsets, wouldhave been lower stilly(ii)    in any case. and without a decision to make any newcuts, we shall,  as at present forecast,  fall to a rate of 2,640calories at the end of April next.      This is due to thenecessity to cut the potato allocations before the new croparrives,  to an inevitable cut to 1 oz.  in the cheese rationthis Document is the property of his britannic majesty s government.The circulation of this paper has been strictly Jimited.it is issued for the personal use of top SECRET .      Copy No..................
owing to inability to buy United States supplies and theprobable cut of 1 02. in the bacon ration.     The cut incheese will be particularly severely felt since it alsofurther reduces our inadequate intake of proteins;(iii)    the new cuts now proposed would reduce this calorielevel at the end of /.pril next to the quite unprecedentedfigure of 2,590.Much the.most important conclusion which emergesfrom this nutritional appendix is,  however,  that under thenew cuts the calorie level would not nearly recover to thedanger line of 2,800 in the second half of the year, but would remain at 2,690, and then sink lower still in the first halfof 19^9.     We accepted the reduction below the danger line of2,800 as a temporary expedient for the first six months of thisyear.      If we adopt these cuts we face the prospect that thistotally inadequate level of nutrition will last on into the indefinite future, with all the grave consequences  to thenation&apos;s health and power to work which this is bound to involve.4. It is for these reasons that I conclude that (i)    a cut in the cheese ration,  (ii)    a cut in the potato ration (theseare inevitable),  (iii)    a cut in the fats ration,  (iv)    afurther cut in the distribution of the already severely cutpoints foods, and (v)    a probable cut in the bacon ration,coming together at the end of April,  to be followed by a cut in the bread ration&apos; in July, would definitely tend, by bothits psychological and physiological consequences,  to launchus upon that fatal descending spiral of reduced effort,  output,exports,  and so ability to import, which is so rightly dreaded.Moreover, such cuts would place an intolerable additional strain on our already creaking rationing system and might well convertthe lowering of the standards of public conduct on food rationing which is already apparent, int* a breakdown of theFrench kind.5. Still further food cuts on top of those inevitable in any case will not be accepted by our people unless they form part of drastic measures to put our whole economy on a siegebasis, to barter our exports directly for food and row materials,end to review all our commitments,  such as would become inevitable if the Mrrshall Plan is defeated.60 In view of the above consequences, I beg my colleagues-not to accept the recommendations on food (paragraph 20 of thememorandum) en bloc,  but to examine them in detail.     Moreover,it can be shown that by far the greater part of the dollarsaving proposed can be achieved without incurring the   intolerablenutritional&apos;consequences shown above.7. I therefore make the following proposals in regard to each of the recommendations.8.  (a)        &quot;There should be no increase in the basic rationsuntil the /position on Marshall Aid is clear1&apos;I accept this recommendation.
9. &quot; - that the fats ration should be reduced to7 oz. on 2J4-th April&quot;None of our oils and fats now come from dollar sources,but the memorandum, makes it clear that the object of thisrecommendation is to free oils and fats for export.    I acceptthe recommendation to make oils and fats available for export,and have already given instructions to export oils and fatseither as raw materials or manufactured products to dollardestinations in the following ways :-(i)    10,000 tons for soap exports - this will give some&apos;  15,000 tons of soap exports to a value of 8,000,000(ii) up to 1,000 tons for the manufacture of oleineand stearine for possible sale in the U.S.A.and Canada to the value of  500,000(iii)    10,000 tons of West African palm oil and groundnutsfor export to Canada at a value of  2,1400,000.This is all edible oils and fats the Canadianshave asked for from Colonial territories.    Theywould also buy i+j 000 tons of tallow for 1,600,000.   This would mean a diversion of argentine or New Zealand tallov/ and wouldprobably create difficulties with our suppliers.But it is being examined.This is the maximum amount (some  10 millions)  of dollarearning exports that-can be achieved by setting aside oils and fats.    I see no method of obtaining the full  13 millions of dollar earnings mentioned in Annex D of C.P.(^8) 35.    Onthe other hand the export of some 23,000 to 30,000 tons of oils and fats proposed above does not necessarily involvereducing the oils and fats ration on 2m-th. April.   Whether infact we have to do this or not depends on how the supply situation develops.10. I therefore submit that to decide now to reduce theoils and fats ration by 1 oz. on 2/ith April would bring usno direct dollar saving and could only be justified onpsychological grounds as a method of bringing home the crisisto the public.   But surely it cannot be wise to choose a method which must have such grave nutritional consequencesas a way of bringing home the crisis?    To decide now to make this particularly undesirable cut - since fats enable people to eat enough fish, bread and other foodstuffs which we can.give them, to keep up their strength - will bring no dollargain, but merely enable us to put fats into store.11. I do not know how we should defend such a departure from our announced policy of cutting foodstuffs from dollar sources but endeavouring to make up these cuts from sterlingor other &quot;soft&quot; sources.    In announcing the cuts last autumnthe Chancellor told the House \-&quot;These reductions - I want to emphasise this with all my strength to the House - these reductions are concerned only with dollar purchases.   They are only in order to save dollar expenditure.    If they can be made up bypurchases for sterling from any other sources in the worldthen, of course, we shall make every effort to make them up.&quot;
Now,  however,  it is proposed, that far from making up for cutsfrom dollar sources wo should add to thorn a cut in a foodstuffderived wholly from sterling and other soft sources.12.    (b)    &quot;The Ministry of.Food should submit proposals for&quot;&quot;ttie maximum. possible storage of food whether fromhar^d or soft currency sources&quot;(c)    ^The^ Ministry of Food should submit a programme for&quot;&quot;the maximum possible &quot;substitution o&apos;f&apos; storable ordollar foods now included in the basic ration byfoo&apos;d&apos;s at present on points or unrationed&quot;I attach at Appendix B a note on these two proposals.We will make a careful study of the possibilities of foodstorage in case the emergency situation of the defeat of the marshall Plan arises -   But I must point out that it is notpossible to place additional quantities of food into store,beyond our normal seasonal programme, at the moment withoutstill further reducing rations or other forms of distribution and so still further reducing the caloric level.    The sameconsideration applies to the substitution of storable or dollarfoods now included in the basic ration by foods at present on points or unrationed.    It will be seen that we have alreadyheavily reduced the more substantial items of our pointsscheme, such as canned fish and conned meat.    We are nowdistributing canned meat,  for example,  at the rate of3,100 tons a month as-against 13,000 tons a month.    Everyfurther cut made here will also reduce the calorie level.Moreover,  it will do so in the most undesirable way by removingalmost the last element of variety left in our diet.13*    (d)    &quot;We should increase to the maximum food exports from the sterling areas to dollar countries,and! that this should take precedence over the domestic supplies here.   It is under this heading that we may secure the&apos; greatest dollarsaying&quot;I accept this recommendation.    In fact it has alreadybeen put into effect in the case of supplies of cocoa which arenow being sold in the United. States and Canada.    I furtheraccept the proposal that we should not seek to restore the 2^- oz.tea ration, but should apply any additional quantities of teawhich- we can purchase from India to re-export to America and canada.    It is possible that something may be done on theselines with a number of the other less essential foodstuffs.Oh the other hand there is a limit to the extent to which-wecan suddenly inform the Commonwealth and Colonial countries,who have been making great efforts to send their products tothe United Kingdom, that we no longer desire to consume them,and that they should now seek to divert them to Canada andthe U.S.A.    I do not know whether it is fully realised that wehave made strenuous and by no means unsuccessful efforts to earn dollars by means of food exports from the United Kingdom.I attach at Appendix C an account of the progress made in thisdirection. - It will be seen that in particular a flourishing-entrepot trade in sugar has been established since last Augustwhen food exports were resumed..&apos; We are now earning dollars orother hard currency at a rate of nearly  10 millions worth of
dollars a year by moans of this purchase and resole of dollarsugar.    Thus the obligation which I accepted last August toincrease food exports by  10 millions a year has been nearlyachieved in sugar alone - and entirely in respect of dollarearning exports.    In addition,  as shown above in paragraph 9we are developing a successful export of high priced soap.Third, we are restoring our traditional trade in high pricedbiscuits and chocolate confectionery.   Fourth, we have&quot; devoteda greatly increased quantity of cereals to the whisky distillerson condition that thoy export 75;-a of their whisky instead of50%, the whole of the additional quantity to go to dollardestinations.    These exports of foodstuffs are not easy todefend in the House or to the country, or to our suppliers inthe Commonwealth, but they show the willingness of theMinistry of Food to make the greatest possible efforts to earn dollars.1L\.*    (e)    &quot;Urgent consideration should be given to ihqpossibility of reducing the bread ration&quot; &apos;from&quot; to 8 Bi.Us.i a wee&apos;k in the second half of the year&quot;My Department will,  of course, give carefulconsideration to all measures for economising wheat.    Butthe objections to a cut in the bread ration appear to me verygreat.    I fear that a complete^ new and much more drasticbread rationing scheme would have to be introduced to makethe cut effective.    It will be exceedingly difficult to devise such a scheme and to make it acceptable at a moment when the world cereal position is visibly improving to&apos; a markedextent.    It remains to be seen whether an offer to the Canadiansto reduce the amount of our wheat contract with than by some10% (1+00,000 tons) as a condition for our ceasing to take their livestock products, would be attractive to them.    If theprice of wheat at the time is still markedly above next year&apos;scontract price to us, namely 02, they might possibly be attracted, but if, as is quite possible,  it is at or below02, they would, on the contrary, regard this as a breach of our contract by refusal to take the stipulated quantities.15. In conclusion I fully realise that even if marshall aid materialises our food outlook will remain sombre.    I acceptthe official proposals (in the memorandum annexed to E.P.C.(47) 33)which ask in general for no more than a restoration of recentcuts, thus giving us a diet comparable to that of 1945.   Thiswill be a bitter disappointment to our people who will undoubtedlyanticipate much greater relief if Marshall Aid is received.But I agree that it is necessary to use any breathing spacegiven us to make our economy viable at the earliest possible moment.   But the fact that this disappointment is in any eventin store for our people makes it all the more wrong, in my view,to inflict on them now, before we know what the real situationis going to bo, a level of nutrition on which in the view ofthe Government&apos;s scientific and nutritional advisers it willbe impossible for them to maintain their heo-lth and strength.J.S.Ministry of Food, S.W.I.11th February, 1948.
HiAPPENDIX  fAfNOTE ON THE NUTRITIONAL EFFECTS OF THEFOOD CUTS SUGGESTED IN CP. (a8)1* The table below shows the effects on the calorie andprotein intakes of the following cuts proposed inparagraph 20 (a) ,  (c)  and (e) of CP. (I46) 35 -(i)    A reduction in the fat ration from 8 oz.  to 7 oz.from 2k th April.(ii)    A reduction in the bread ration from 9 to 8 B.U&apos;from 1st July.     For purposes of calculation this has beentaken as a reduction of one-ninth in the overall breadji      consumption.(iii)    The diversion to storage of all canned meat atpresent issued on points and of 25 per cent, of the pointsallocations of dried fruit,  condensed milk,  canned fish andpulses.     These have been taken as illustrative of the typeof economy envisaged in paragraph 20 (c).2. The following assumptions have been made in the table: -(i)    The figures for the current month are based on thepresent rations of &quot;8 oz. fat&quot;,  2 oz. cheese,  2 02. bacon and3 lb. potatoes per week.(ii)    The figures for April-June allow for an unavoidablereduction of 1 02.  in the cheese rations     They assume areduction of 1 oz.  in the bacon ration after April;    thiswill be inevitable unless the continuance of Canadian andDanish supplies can be secured.      They also assume areduction in the potato allowance to l  lb.(iii)    The figures for July-December allow for an increasein potato consumption to the level expected on the agreedtarget of 1,1423,000 acres.(iv)    The &quot;before new cut&quot; figures both assume thepossibility of continuing the 8 oz. fat ration, beyond2/4th April, which is, however,  by no means certain on supply grounds.3* The figures are the best approximations possible atthis date;    they represent national overage consumption levelsCalories per day Protein ( r. -per day)Before new   After new     Before new   After newcuts cuts cuts cutsSeptember, 19I+7 2875-. 82.current month(February, 19U-8) 2730 80.22l4t-h April/30th June, 19I48       26I4-O - 2590 -77.0 76.01st July/31st- December, 19^48  2860 2690 83.5 79.0
I(. As a result of the earlier cuts and of the potatoshortage, the current calorie intake of 2,730 is well belowthe accepted marginal figure of 2,800.     The reductions alreadyprogrammed for April-June will reduce this figure to about,6hO,  a dangerously low lisvel which, if maintained for morethan a very short period - will undoubtedly result inimpaired health and which is in any&apos;event likely to lead to adecrease in working efficiency.5. -   The additional cuts now suggested would not onlybring the calorie level for ^pril-June below 2,600, but wouldmake it even more difficult to produce a reasonably attractivediet from the rapidly diminishing variety of available foods.A point might indeed,  very soon be reached at which theunattractiveness of the diet would itself limit foodconsumption ^ for example, as a result tif the increasing shortageof bread spreads - with still more serious consequences to thelevel of calorie intake.6. When the Cabinet decided on the previous food    cutslast October they anticipated that the nutritional position inthe second half of 19k&amp; would not be substantially worse than before  the cuts,  and that the warnings then given by theGovernment&apos;s medical and scientific advisers would thereforeapply only to the first six months of the year.     The abovetable shows, however,  that the proposed new cuts would reducethe programmed intake of 2860 calories to 2690 for the wholeof the second six months,  thus seriously prolonging the periodof underfeeding.7. The level of food consumption in the first half ofany year is on the average below that in the second half.From past experience it seems likely thrt, if the proposed new cuts were to be continued beyond 19k8, the calorie level for the first half. of 19!i9 would be about 70 calories below that for the last half of 19&apos;-l8, i.e. would be of the order of2,600 calories.8. The serious consequences of such drastic and prolonged reductions in the level of food intake cannot be over-emphasisedr      When in the first half of 19U1 the calorielevel fell even for a few months to a figure of 2,680,  therewere definite indications of impaired health;    infant andmaternal mortality and the death rate from tuberculosis rose to a peak, while there were regressions in the heights andweights of school children.      There is reason to believe thatthis decline in the public health waa associated;, at least inpart, with the deterioration in the national diet.9. The effects on the morale and working efficiency ofthe population of such continuing low levels of food intake,which will inevitably involve real hunger among many sections ofthe community,  are self-evident.10. There is no need to stress the importance of breadas a &quot;filler&quot; and the detrimental effect of taking any step which might limit still further the intake of this staple food.
- APPENDIX  ,B&apos;POSSIBILITIES OP INCREASING POOD STOCKSOf the basic rationed foods,  the storablecommodities are wheat and flour, fats,  sugar, meat and to aless extent cheese.     Wheat and fats are dealt with in thememorandum.      The cut of 2 oz. in the sugar ration and of25 per cent,  in manufacturing issues which was made last autumn will not result in the large accumulation of stocks whichwas expected at that time.     The quantities saved are being used to supply the Colonies who would otherwise have topurchase dollar sugar.     Nor, in view of toe reduced purchases of meat provided for under the new Argentine agreement, will the maintenance of a 1/- ration result in the expected piling-up of meat stocks.      Cheese supplies will not be sufficientto enable the 2 oz.  ration to be maintained;    a reduction to1 oz. for about 6 months of 19*4 3 will be necessary,  stockpiling is therefore out of the question.     The cessation ofnew purchases in dollar areas made it necessary to reducesubstantially the issues of a number of important points foods.The following table shows the average Li-week releases of imported canned meats, canned fish,  dried fruit,  pulses andcondensed milk,  during the year ended 16th August, 19*4 7?  ascompared with the period 17th August, 19*4 7 to 3rd January, 19*4 8.The average 14-week releases of these foods to be made for theyear ending 1*4th August,  19*48?  (based on present estimates of future releases) are given in column (i4) of the table.Average U-we-ek releasesCommodity Year ended Period !8/8/u7       Year endingIJlQlkl to Vl/kS 1*4/87*18(1)                         -   (2)                       (T (*4)tons                    tons tonsCanned Meats           13,000 3,100 3,*400Canned Pish               3,*400 2,500 2,200Dried Eruit             10,100 10,3*40 (a) 7,510Condensed Milk       10,700 9,300 (b) 7,100Pulses                       1,500                    50 250(a) Includes special Christmas releases(b) Covers part of winter programme.The present reduced rates of allocation are in some cases,e.g, canned fish, condensed milk,  only being maintained bygradually running down stocks so that unless alternativesupplies can be obtained we shall in any case find it necessaryto reduce allocations still further.     Such additional suppliesof points foods as are included in our supplementary import programme are    in general only sufficient to maintain our stocks for a somewhat longer period:      they are not being used toincrease consumption.     A decision to build up stocks of pointsfoods would thus mean an immediate reduction in the number of points per person or a drastic increase in points prices.
There is no hope of appreciable savings by-replacing basic rationed foods with points foods orunrationed foods and putting on equivalent quantity of basic foods into stock,  as suggested in paragraph 20 (c)of   CP. (1(8)&apos; 35*     The foods which&apos;are in the points scheme or which are unrationed are by nature unsuitable forstraight rationing:      this is largely the reason v/hy theywere not included in the ordinary rationing system.      Inso far as such switches were possible they would representfurther cuts in total food consumption.
&apos;     APPENDIX T0?EXPORTS    OF    FOODSTUFFS1. During the war our only significant food, exportwas whisky.   The high &quot;export&quot; figures given in the Tradeand Navigation Returns were misleading;    the totals were, inthe main,  exports to Colonies and other countries dependenton us and unrequited exports to HAAFI, UNRRA and other overseasobligations.To achieve by the end of 1924.8 the target of 66 millions of food exports per annum announced in October 19h7means therefore -(a) increasing our global total of food exports;(b) substituting real for unrequited exports includedin earlier totals and(c) securing new markets for diversions occasioned byrestrictions on exports to the Colonies;to the tune of some  14.0 millions per annum.    It is gratifyingto observe that in spite of these very considerable difficultiesthe attainment of the full target figure of  66 millions offood exports is already in sight.    Moreover,  in the process of achieving this overall increase we have managed to raise our food exports to hard currency areas from a monthly rate of 1.4 millions in August to a rate of  2 millions in December.The proportion of food exports to hard currency areas rose from 3Li.y0 of the total in August 19^-7 to kkyo of the total inDecember 1947.2. The main contributors to the result are -(i)    Whisky:    at present 75/i of all releases areexported and of these nearly 85:-&apos;o are sent toCategory A countries and South Africa ( 12 millions per annum).    The possibilities of directing evenmore of these exports to Category A and 3 countries are being discussed with the Scotch WhiskyAssociation.(ii)    Sugar:    v\re have made a net hard currency gain of 10 millions in the last four months by exportingrefined sugar.(iii)    Soap:    materials for soap exports are released byagreement with the trade export group for exportonly to specified countries, the majority ofwhich are in hard currency areas.    Steps are beingtaken to intensify direction of this commodity,the commercial exportsrjff which are now estimatedat  3&apos;s millions per annum.
(iv)    The other principal processed foods in the export programme are chocolates, biscuits, beer and gin.Our trade with the hard currency countries is normally a luxury trade where there is a highratio selling price to the cost of theingredients.(v)    Outside the manufacturing processes there remains the merchanting field.   We are trying with some difficulty to restore world markets in London.The following will give some indication of thesuccesses achieved to date -(a) Cereals.   A scheme has now been inoperation for over 12 uonths under whichgrain traders are enabled to secureappropriate currency with which to conductinternational trading in cereals, on condition that no loss is sustained in terms of currency, i.e. a transactioninvolving a hard currency purchase and asoft currency sale would not be permitted.Statistics are not available within theMinistry to show the volume of such tradebut a number of transactions have takenplace with benefit to the balance ofpayments position.(b) Sugar.    The principal transactions at presentare in respect of refined sugar.   Rawsugar is imported into this country whereit is refined and sold again to hard currency areas,  a very substantial net gain in hard currency being made.    Some tradeis also done in raw sugar but tneopportunities for this are very limited atpresent.   Both the refined sugar and raw- - sixgar trade referred to above are carriedout by brokers under the supervision ofthe Ministry.(c) Tea.   We are making a determined effort torestart the London tea market and this willbe done when London stocks have been built up to serve as a cushion.   There is a further difficulty at present.    Indian merchants are trying to establish an alternative to theLondon tea market in Calcutta but it isdoubtful whether this will ever be a very,great success by reason, of the lack of facilities, knowledge and long experience.(d) The possibilities in relation to coffee areat present being examined.
