Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1948IISECRET Copy No. 3 (c.p.. (48) 5216*A February, 1948CABINETINFORMATION REGARDING WAGES negotiations memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at their meeting on 29th January (CM. (48) 8th Conclusions, Minute 7)the Cabinet invited me to keep the Ministers in charge of Production Departmentsfully informed of wage discussions likely to lead to important negotiations.2. It will be appreciated that the first indication that my Departmentmay have about a wages claim is that negotiations have been opened. MyDepartment has, however, in recent months informed the Production Departmentsconcerned of wage claims of national significance as soon as details of the claimsput forward have been available and, when practicable, has kept Departmentsinformed as to the progress of the negotiations on the claims and the detailsof the final settlements. When appropriate, an appreciation has been given ofthe possible repercussions and consequences of particular claims. Thus, attention was drawn at the beginning of last September to the likelihood of repercussions on road passenger transport from the claim for increased wages which was thenbeing discussed by the Joint Industrial Council for the Road Haulage Industry,and again at the beginning of December, when proposals for wage increases were issued by the Road Haulage Central Wages Board. It was not until the endof the second week in January that details of the various claims in road passenger transport became available and these were immediately communicated to the interested Departments.3. My Department will continue to pass on information as in the past andwill also so far as possible inform Departments of any indications there may bethat a wage claim in a particular industry can be expected in the near future.Information as to possible future claims probably can only be in very general terms and it may not be possible to give any definite indication as to the size and nature of the claim which will be presented, the date at which it can be expected,or the determination with which it will be pressed. It should be appreciated,moreover, that the nature of the settlement likely to be reached on a claim, whichis of course of greater significance to the Production Departments than the claimitself, is not directly related to the size or nature of the claim itself and cannotbe forecast.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,16th February, 1948.34942ji!
