Man-power the expansion of employment which occurred in October and november was not maintained in December 1947. It appears that many women whopostponed retirement in the autumn left industry about Christmas time.Consequently there was a fall of 12,000 in the total number employed in manufacturing industries (Table 1).2. Employment in building and civil engineering, which had fallen slightly in November, recovered in December to almost the same level as October. It is,however, a little too early to see what effects the cuts in capital investment willhave on employment in these industries. Preliminary figures for January showsome decline.Under-manned industries3. The December figures did not show any significant changes inemployment in the under-manned industries (Table 2) but preliminary figures for coal mining and cotton spinning for January and February show some further increase in numbers employed. The numbers on colliery books rose from 718,000in December to 721,000 in the second week in February.Unemployment \4. There was a further increase in unemployment in January; the totalpersons registered as unemployed in Great Britain rose from 277,000 on 8th December to 318,000 on 12th January. This increase includes about,000 non-disabled persons unsuitable for ordinary employment previouslyexcluded from the figures. The increase during the last quarter of (1947was confined to agriculture and fishing, building and civil engineering,transport and communications and miscellaneous services in all of which some increase was to be expected seasonally during the autumn and winter months(Table 3).34940 &apos; B

The new interim index of production (details are given in the Appendix)lias been prepared to provide an overall measure of monthly changes in totalindustrial production. The index covers the output of mining, manufacturing,building and contracting, and public utilities. It shows changes in the volume ofindustrial production compared with average monthly production in 1946 = 100.Adjustments have been made to the monthly figures to allow for differences in thenumber of normal working days in each month, .but no adjustments have beenmade for holidays or seasonal variations.6. The rate of production in November 1947 is provisionally estimated at19 per cent, higher than the average of 1946. Production is, however, seasonallyhigh in the autumn. Comparison between 1946 and 1947 shows that except for february and March the rate of production was higher than in the correspondingmonths of 1946.Interim Index of Total Industrial ProductionAverage 1946 = 100JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril ...May ...June ...July   ...AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember7. For manufacturing industries alone the index of production (1946 = 100)was 120 in November 1947 a rise of 9 per cent, compared with November 1946.Coal8. Output of deep-mined coal has fallen below 4 million tons a week in thelast four weeks (Table 4).   The weekly figures this year have been :-Week ended Thousand tonsJanuary 10 ...      ............ 3,942January 17 ... ...      ...                ... 4,012January 24 ...      ...      ...      ...... 3,934January 31 ...      .........      ... 3,965February 7............... 3,897February 14 ...      .,......       ... 3,9709. Stocks of coal are, however, high and deliveries of coal for export andbunkers were stepped up in January and it has been decided to raise them to300,000 tons a week.  They will then be about one-third of the pre-war level.Steel10. Weekly output of steel ingots and castings in January was 281,000tons even higher than the previous record of 275,000 tons in October 1947.Supplies of pig iron and scrap have increased, but not sufficiently to keep pace with this high level of steel output (Table 5). Stocks of pig iron and scrap have both now begun to fall again and are much lower than a year ago.SioclcsEnd of Period                                     Pig iron ScrapThousand tons Thousand tons1946 December     ...      ...    .......     ...     856 6161947 June ...      ...      ......      ...     611 4841947 December    ...      ..!      ...      ...    473&quot; 3731948 January      ...      .........    438 354
Cotton Spinning11. Output has increased during successive weeks of January and for themonth was 9 per cent, higher than in January last year. In the week ending31st January output was 15-2 million lb. its highest since the end of the warbut still only about two-thirds of what it was in 1937 (Table 5).III.-Agriculture12. The target acreage for wheat in the United Kingdom in 1948is 2 - 50 million acres. Autumn sowings in 1947 were held up by the drought and at4th December, 1947, it is estimated that only 2-10 million acres had been sown.A creage of WheatSown on     Final acreage at June4th December    of following yearMillion acres       Million acres1942 ............... 3-25 3-461945 .............\. 1-92 2 061946 ............      ... 1-94 2 161947 ...      ......      ...... 2-10 2-50(&apos;)(*) Target acreage.IY.-External Trade13. The January figures of imports and exports are not yet available. the analysis of the December figures now made shows that the balance of trade with theWestern Hemisphere was still very adverse, but we had succeeded in balancingimports and exports with other countries. The December figures have showed that exports to the Western Hemisphere had increased to a new record level, whileimports continued to fall from the high rate they reached in July (Table 6).14. The volume of exports in the last quarter of 1947 was 17 per cent, higherthan in 1938. Exports of manufactured goods have made the biggest contributionso far to the rise in total exports; shipments of coal and textiles are much less than before the&apos;war.Index of volume of British exports (1938 -100)	Total exports	Articles wholly or mainly manufactured				Food, drink and tobacco	Coal and raw materials		Total	Metal goods	Textiles	Other manufac-tures		1946 1st Qtr.  ...	84	90	102	62	99	89	282nd Qtr. ...	98	110	133	68	112	91	273rd Qtr.  ...	104	117	139	73	123	92	254th Qtr.  ,..	112	127	155	78	128	81	311947 1st Qtr.  ...	100	114	140	73	110	66	292nd Qtr.  ...	102	116	147	68	108	72	253rd Qtr.  ...	114	131	168	72	123	86	214th Qtr.  ...	117	132	172	77	117	100	18Y. Balance of Payments15. The net drain on our gold and dollar reserves was  57^ million inJanuary 1948, compared with  48 million in December 1947 (Table 7). Thereasons for this increase were : I. South A frica. In December receipts of gold from South Africa in com-pletion of the year&apos;s gold sales agreement were exceptionally large,reducing the net drain accordingly; in January 1948 no gold wasreceived from South Africa but some dollars were provided by us ohher behalf. (It is hoped that these will be reimbursed in accordancewith our agreement with her.)34940 b 2
II. Canada.-Larger payments in United States dollars were made to&apos; Canada due to a seasonal increase in our purchases from her and the reduced rate of our drawings on the Canadian Credit.III. Belgium.-A continued drain of gold to Belgium which has taken over 8 million since the beginning of 1948. &apos;IV. Egypt. Egypt has already drawn the whole of the $25 million for1948 provided in the agreement with her.V. India. Continued heavy dollar drawings by India to cover purchases inthe Argentine as well as the United States. It is hoped that the Indiandrain will henceforward be very much diminished.Total net1947:-First half    ...July ......August September October November December     ...1948 :-January       ...      ...      ... 57^(&apos;) Including drawings on United States and Canadian credits and the International monetary fund.YI. Bilateral Negotiations16. Since the date of my last report negotiations have been concluded with Argentina and Switzerland. There follow notes on these negotiations andon the principal negotiations in progress.A rgentina17. Under the Agreement just initialled we shall obtain our meat and feeding-stuffs programmes and also payment for the railways, all without anydollar payment by us. We have also secured removal of restrictions on our exportsto the Argentine up to a value of  10 million with a personal promise by thePresident that future expansion will be granted if the Argentine exchange position improves sufficiently. We have undertaken to supply certain scarcecommodities, in particular 1 million tons of coal and some 2 million tons of oil,and to make an immediate advance up to the total value of the Ministry of Foodpayments to facilitate the railway purchase. The avoidance of a dollar paymentis of particular importance both in itself and as a helpful precedent in othernegotiations.Brazil. 18. A Mission has arrived in Rio de Janeiro and negotiations have justbegun. Our principal objectives are the continuance of payments in sterling with no dollar liability to secure essential supplies of which the most important isrice and the freest possible entry for our own exports. We may also be ableto persuade Brazil to use blocked and currently accruing sterling for debtredemption. We are offering some valuable scarce commodities, notably coal and alkalis.Netherlands19. We get desirable food imports at satisfactory prices which involvesubsidies from the Dutch Government. We have also secured important concessionsfor our exporters. Arrangements were made for the repayment by the Dutchof their war indebtedness to the United Kingdom.Belgium20. Negotiations are reaching the final stages- for an exchange of trade ona higher level than in 1947. We paid substantial quantities of gold to Belgiumin 1947 and had expected that this would cease in 1948 and that there would bea substantial balance in our favour. We have, however, already paid  9 million in&quot;gold this year and the terms of the proposed agreement are being reviewed.Denmark21. We had provisionally arranged to take 45,000 tons of butter at321s. Qd. a cwt. and 22,000 tons of bacon at 225s. a, cwt. The Danes are, however,still pressing us for additional allocations of steel and for a dollar ration andin on reserves^)  million... 467......... 133...... 156...... 93.......... 67.  -   ......... 59...... 48
are not yet prepared to give satisfactory undertakings about imports of our less essential goods. Negotiations are continuing; we may have to accept somewhat less butter.Switzerland22. The Swiss Government have agreed to admit Sterling Area importsfreely, and that they will maintain their existing sterling balances. Their exportsto the Sterling Area are to be limited under the Agreement so as to avoid loss ofgold. The Agreement also includes arrangements for the resumption of tourist traffic on a limited scale.YII. PricesWholesale Prices23. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices for January was 209(1938 = 100) compared with 201 in December 1947 and 179 in January 1947.The sharp rise in January was due to&apos;the removal from the beginning of themonth of the subsidies on cotton cloths and leather, and the rise in the price ofwoodpulp, coal and iron and steel.Import and Export Prices24. The index number of import prices (1938=100) rose further inDecember to 261 and export prices to 243. During the first half of 1947 import prices rose more rapidly than export prices, but export prices rose more thanimport prices in the last half of the year.Prices in the United States25. A sharp decline in commodity prices in the United States took place during the last fortnight. Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices(31st December, 1931 = 100) fell from 459 on 12th January to 402 on13th February almost to the level of a year ago. March wheat futures onthe Chicago Exchange were quoted at $3 13 a bushel on 12th January and$2-40 on 13th February, compared with $1-97 on 29th June, 1946.Moody&apos;s Index of Staple Commodity Prices in the United States(31st December, 1931 = 100)1948 19472nd January      ............         452 38012th January     ............         459 37613th February    .........      ...         402 39516th February    ............         410 398YIIL-Wage Rates26. The index of weekly wage rates for all industries (September 1939 = 100)rose from 165 to 166  in the first half of 1947 and more sharply from 166^ to173 in the second half of the year (Table 9). There was a further rise inJanuary 1948. During the month, agreements were reached or awards given in14 industries involving increases in wages and in 4 industries involving areduction in the working week without loss of pay.27. At the end of December, wage rates in the following under-mannedindustries had increased more than the average for all industries since september 1939.(September 1939 - 100).       i. ...      260Agriculture ............Coal mining ...      ---      -..... ; ^Coke ovens............ ^ggCotton    ... --      ---grh     - .....    176Pottery   ... .......      ---There were further increases in January in wage rates in cotton spinning and manufacturing and in wool and silk maufacture.28. At the end of January there were 30 claims in which no settlement wasreached during the month (of these 8 were new claims during the month). Themost important of these were in respect of the woollen industry, and road passenger transport. Other claims outstanding are on behalf of retail distributiveworkers employed in Co-operative Societies, workers in furniture manufacture and engineers employed in Government establishments.

The present index is to be regarded as provisional untilthe results of the next Census of Production to be taken in 1948 are available.The index has been prepared by the Central Statistical Office in collaboration with the Statistics Divisions of&quot; Government Departments/1. The Index is intended to provide a general measure of monthly changesin the volume of industrial production in the United Kingdom. Mining, manu-facturing, building and public utilities are included; but transport, distribution,commerce and services are excluded; the index covers all types of production,whether for the home market, for export or for the Armed Forces.2. The Index is based on about 360 individual production series, almost all of which represent physical quantities produced. In a few cases, such asclothing, and electrical and mechanical engineering changes in output are derivedfrom figures of the value of production, adjusted for changes in prices. in building and in shipbuilding, where the process of production extends over along period and the number of finished products does not provide a reliablemeasure of current output, special estimates have been made which take accountof changes in the amount of work in- progress.3. The level of production in each month is expressed as a percentageof the average monthly production in 1946. To ensure comparability between different months, adjustments have been made, where necessary, for variations in the number of normal working days in each month. But the index reflectsany changes in production caused by holidays and seasonal factors, for which Jno adjustments have been made. *4. In combining the individual production series to form the group indicesgiven in the table, the general method has been to allocate weights to different industries, proportional to the estimated relative net output in 1946.   These
lestimates are based on (i) the net output of different industries in 1935, asI shown by the Census of Production, (ii) estimates of the net output of smallfirms which were not covered by the Census of Production, and (lii) estimatesUf the changes in the total wage bill in each industry between 1935 and 1946,jobtained from the numbers of insured persons employed and average weekly earnings. In the case of products for which no measure of current output is available, the weights appropriate to these products have been apportioned tobther items within the same industry, so that each main industry group is given;its proper weight.   In form, the index is a weighted arithmetic average.In addition to the overall index, separate indices have been calculated forthe following industrial groups: .....
