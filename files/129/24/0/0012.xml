The Security Council will probablyplace this report on its agenda almost immediately.2. It is recommended that the Secretary of State for theColonies should go to New York in order to lead the UnitedKingdom Delegation in the Security Council,     His first task would be to defend the record of His Majesty&apos;s government since 29th November,  and to explain the policy which we arenow pursuing in Palestine.      (For the present situation inPalestine see CP. (h8) ho).3* His Majesty&apos;s Government have been criticised for refusing to permit the United Nations Commission to enterPalestine more than two weeks before the termination of theMandate;    for refusing to lay down the Mandate piecemeal andto make a progressive transfer of their powers to theCommission,&apos;    and for refusing to evacuate the Port of TelAviv in order that it may be used for Jewish immigrationbefore the Mandate comes to an end.     It is recommended thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies should explain the impossibility of divesting ourselves of responsibility forany part -of Palestine so long as the Mandate lasts, or ofrelinquishing control over Jewish immigration during the sameperiod.     We have been prepared to examine the possibilityof making a concession to the United Nations Commission on-the remaining point,  the period during which the Commission&apos;spresence in Palestine will overlap the Mandate.     TheSecretary of State for the Colonies has sent a telegram toJerusalem, asking for the views of the High Commissioner andof the General Officer Commanding on the possibility of
admitting the Commission a week or two earlier than we had previously proposed.     When the views of the High commissioner and of the General Officer Commanding are known, it may befound possible to arrive at a compromise which would help to demonstrate the reasonableness of our attitude.      In any event, a vigorous statement of our attitude, made in the &apos;Security Council, should do much to remove the misunderstandingto which we are at present exposed.h* With regard to the proposal for enforcement of partition by means of an international force, it is recommended that the United Kingdom Delegation should expressno opinion in the Security Council and should abstain from voting without however exercising a veto.     The reasons forthis recommendation are stated in the Annex.5* According to reports in the Press, the Jewish Agencyhave sent a memorandum to the United Nations PalestineCommission, accusing the members of the Arab League ofconspiring to overthrow the decision of the United nations on Palestine, and calling for sanctions against them.     Ifthese reports are confirmed, and if a resolution condemningthe Arab States is placed upon the Agenda of the security council,  the United Kingdom Delegation should ensure thatthey are given a fair hearing in accordance with Article 31of the Charter.     Since it is impossible at this stage to foresee what form such a- resolution would take, it is not proposed that any further guidance on- their attitude towardsit should now be given- to the Delegation.E. B.A.C-J.5th February.
ANNEXProposal for an International ForceAn attempt to enforce the General Assembly&apos;decision on Palestine by military action would be exceedinglydangerous from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government.If the Security Council were to decide upon the establishmentof such a force,&apos; and to decide that it should consist ofcontingents of regular armies,  it would be impossible toprevent either the Soviet Union or one at least of itssatellites from taking part0      It is possible that the intervention of any international force in Palestine wouldhave the effect of prolonging and extending the conflict whichis now inevitable in that country.      The Arab population,  sofar from being intimidated by the Security Council&apos;s threat of military action, would probably be goaded into even greater violence than is now occurringPublic opinion inthe independent Arab States would undoubtedly be inflamed,and since some of the Arab Governments are peculiarlysusceptible to the pressure of extremist opinion,  it islikely that they would be driven to intervene more openlyand on a larger scale than they are now doing in support ofthe Palestinian Arabs.      This argument applies particularly to Syria and Iraq.      In each of these countries, popularclamour might well drive the Government into open defiance of the United Nations,  and the Security Council&apos;s forcemight find itself confronted in Palestine by units of the iraqi and Syrian army.     Any such extension of theconflagration would, furthermore, have grave economicrepercussions in Western Europe-      The Marshall Plan is toa considerable extent dependent   on the uninterrupted flow of Middle Eastern oil to Western Europe.     Already there isa serious prospect that the flow of Iraqi oil through Haifamay be interrupted for some time,.      If either Syria or Iraqwere to be drawn into the conflict in Pales cine, Iraqi oilwould also cease to flow through the pipe-line to Tripoli,and in addition all projects for piping Arabian and Persian-Gulf oil to..the Mediterranean would be indefinitely suspended.2. On the other hand, if it were decided in principlethat such a force should be created, many docisIons of detailwould then have to be taken concerning its character,composition and command,  its sources of armaments, suppliesend reserves.     The force would then have to be assembled,trained,  shipped to Palestine and deployed there.      it therefore seems likely that the Security Council would takeso long to establish an international force that before it-was ready for use the situation in Palestine would havecrystallised in some form which could not.than be altered by such a force.3. It has already been made clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not agree to authorise the participation ofany British contingents in such a forcec      The foreign secretary,  speaking in the House of Commons on12th December, 19h7?  said of the United Nations&apos; decision on palestine -  -
&quot;We have no intention of opposing that&quot; decision, but we cannot ourselvesundertake, either1 individually orcollectively in association with others, to impose that decision by force&quot;.Since His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to participate in action to enforce the Assembly&apos;s resolution on Palestine,it would clearly be impossible for the Delegation to supportthe establishment of an international force.     If, on theother hand,   they were to oppose it, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be accused of wrecking in the Security Council a plan which they assured the Assembly they would not obstructs     Itthus appears that the only logical attitude for the Delegationis to refrain from expressing an opinion on the substance ofthis proposal in the course of the discussion, and to abstain from voting without however exercising c veto.
