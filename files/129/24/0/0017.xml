(this document IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1948141\  CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.* C.P. (48) 47II0i/i February, 1948CABINET30THE LANE PICTURESMemorandum by the Lord chancellor am a Trustee both of the National Gallery and of the Tate Gallery and cannot therefore claim to possess &quot; the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.&quot;2. I believe that it would be a very serious blow to the National Collectionof pictures in London if the Lane pictures were to be transferred to Irelandsince London is already regrettably weak in the Impressionist School. The Lanecollection contains some outstanding examples of this school.3. The awakening of public interest in all forms of art in this countryis one of the most remarkable and as I think one of the most hopeful signsof the post-war world.A larger number of people are coming to our picture galleries than ever before in our history, and I believe (as was evidenced by the Van Gogh exhibition)that it is particularly the Impressionist and post-Impressionist Schools which havecaught the public interest.In London such examples as we have of these schools can readily be seen by large numbers of people for example, &quot; Les Parapluies &quot; (one of the Lanepictures, and perhaps the finest example of Renoir&apos;s art in the world) is nowbeing exhibited in a most prominent place at the National Gallery and is beinginspected every day by thousands of people in one recent week the attendanceswere over 25,000. If this picture were to be sent to Dublin, I doubt whetherthe number of those inspecting it in a year would equal our daily total. my information is that the attendances do not amount to 250 a week.4. I should not have thought that the giving of the Lane pictures to any authority in Ireland would have had any material effect on our trade negotiations.I regard it as a mere essay in appeasement and as useless as such essays generally are.   If we are going to appease anybody by giving away our possessions, I pishould have thought there was a much stronger case for giving back the Elgin ^ ffmarbles to Greece or the Egyptian collection in the British Museum to Egypt.5. It is clear that no authority in Ireland has any legal claim to thesepictures. That issue was decided by our Courts more than thirty years ago,when an order was made declaring these pictures to be the property of the trustees of the National Gallery.6.   Has any Irish authority any moral claim?I should regard any moral claim based on an unwitnessed codicil as restingupon a very insecure foundation. But I find it quite inconceivable that Sir hugh lane would have encouraged the English authorities to proceed with their negotiations for the building of a Gallery in London to house these very pictures,if he had then had any fixed and definite intention of leaving them to Ireland.Yet this is the course he took after the unwitnessed codicil had been written;and for this very purpose the Gallery was given by Sir Joseph Duveen.7. It was to determine this precise issue of the alleged &quot; moral &quot; claimtiiat a committee was set up more than.twenty years ago; and having gone intothe matter most carefully they came to the unanimous conclusion that to interfere34917
by Act of Parliament with the legal results set out in paragraph 5 would &quot; bringabout a result contrary to the real spirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions.&quot;With this conclusion with which successive Governments have agreed I alsoagree. Why should we now suddenly reopen that which has been finallyadjudicated upon %8. The proposal favoured by the majority of the Lord Presidents Committee(see paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 341) has not even the merit of carrying outSir Hugh Lane&apos;s testamentary dispositions, for it is a proposal to thepictures to the Corporation of&quot;. Dublin. If the codicil had been valid the pictures(in the events which happened) would have had to be sold and the annual incomederived from the proceeds of the sale would have had to be used for buyingpictures for the National Gallery of Ireland.9.   The annex to CP. (47) 341 fails to draw a distinction between (i) leaving the matter to the discretion of the Trustees of the national gallery to fix up a compromise with their opposite numbers in Ireland,if that should prove possible; and(ii) depriving them by Act of Parliament both of their discretion and oftheir pictures.In 1925 the Trustees expressed themselves as willing to negotiate a settlementbut the Irish authorities did not respond.I feel fairly sure that the present Trustees would take the same attitude as the Trustees in 1925; they would certainly have informed opinion in thecountry behind them in so acting.Mr. MeColl, for example, has always been in favour of the first course, butit would be a complete misrepresentation of his views to suggest that he has everfavoured the second course.10. But if the second of the two courses indicated in paragraph 9 is taken the Trustees have determined, as is indicated by the annex to this paper whichthey have asked me to bring before the Cabinet as representing their unanimousviews, to resist the passing of the necessary legislation.r&apos;;:-\-r      &apos; v :v,:; -   - - h -&amp;\**% lG &apos;: &amp;m        JHouse Of Lords, S.W.1,10th February, 1948.ANNEX.Memorandum by the Trustees of the National GalleryThe Lane BequestThe Trustees of the National Gallery understand that the question of givingthe Lane pictures to Ireland may again be raised. They desire to place on record their unanimous and emphatic objections to such a settlement of the problem.Sir Hugh Lane, by his will dated 3rd October, 1913, left the 39 pictures inquestion to the National Gallery in London. By codicil dated 3rd February, 1915,he revoked this bequest and, instead, left these pictures to the City of Dublin-&quot; providing that a suitable building is provided for them within 5 years of mydeath.&quot; In that same codicil he wrote : &quot; If within 5 years a gallery is not forthcoming, then the group of pictures (at the London National Gallery) areto be sold and the proceeds go to fulfilling the purpose of my will.&quot;The codicil was not witnessed. By the law of England and Ireland it wastherefore-of no legal effect. Accordingly, as a result of proceedings in the HighCourt in London on 25th May, 1917, an order was made declaring that thepictures were the property of the Trustees of the National Gallery in London.The Trustees have therefore been in legal possession of the pictures for somethirty years.If the Trustees permanently surrendered to Ireland what they legally holdon behalf of the people of this country, they would be&apos;guilty of a serious injusticeto the latter arid a grave dereliction of-their duty as Trustees.
The Trustees attach the greatest importance to certain of these pictures in themselves, since they are essential to the proper representation of the greatFrench School of 19th-century painting. They would be irreplaceable, even ifthe money to replace them were at the board&apos;s disposal. In the past, otherpictures of comparable quality might conceivably have been acquired; butpurchases by, and gifts to the public collections of London have naturally beenconditioned by the possession of the Lane pictures, and equivalent pictures werenot acquired.To-day equivalent pictures are no longer available; and the removal of theLane pictures would cause deep resentment in the rapidly increasing numbersof those who appreciate them, would leave gaps which could never be filled andwould inflict a most serious blow to the status and completeness of our NationalCollectionIt has been argued that, in spite of the clear legal rights and the loss that legislation would impose on this country, the codicil, though invalid, represents the true last wishes of the Testator; and that therefore either the government or the Trustees are under some &apos;&apos; moral &apos;&apos; obligation to hand the pictures over toIreland.The matter was therefore submitted to a committee appointed by the (Labour)Government in July 1924 to consider whether :  (1) Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of 3rd February, 1915, thoughtthat he was making a legal disposition.(2) If so, whether it was proper&apos; that, in view of the international characterof the matter at issue, the legal defect in the codicil should be remediedby legislation.On 28th July, 1925, the committee reported that their answer to the first question was (by a majority) &quot; Yes &quot; : and to the second (unanimously) &quot; No.&quot;They added that &quot; to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s will by a public Act of parliament would, in addition to constituting a legal precedent of the utmost gravity not justified by the facts, have the effect of bringing about a result contrary to thereal spirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions.&quot;The (Conservative) Government accepted this view, and in 1925 so notifiedthe Irish authorities.The Trustees agree with the finding of the Committee that legislation to modify the codicil would not be in accordance with the real spirit of Sir hugh lane&apos;s intentions, and are therefore of opinion that the proposal would have no&quot; moral &quot; basis. The case for compelling the Trustees by legislation to transferIthe pictures to Ireland (if indeed there can be any case for the expropriationof National property) must depend not on his supposed intention of 3rd February,1915, when ne wrote the codicil, but on the establishment of the fact that on 7th May, 1915, when he was drowned on the Lusitania, Sir Hugh Lane had formed a settled intention that the pictures should go to Dublin.This cannot be established. On the contrary ample evidence by statutorydeclaration makes it clear that the unwitnessed codicil did not represent his finaldecision.In March 1914, almost a year before the date of the codicil and at a time whenthe pictures were in the custody of the National Gallery of London, Sir hugh lane in conversations with Lord Curzon and Mr. McColl confirmed a statementpreviously made by him in writing to the Trustees of the National Gallery that,if he thought that the gift of the collection would lead to the creation of a galleryof modern art, he would be strongly tempted to give it, &quot; but I refuse any definitepromise as I do not intend to act hastily.&quot; He did, however, privately informboth Mr. McColl and Sir Robert Witt that if a gallery Avere provided for them,he would leave his pictures to London.Accordingly in May 1914, Mr. McColl began negotiations with Mr. Duveen(later Sir Joseph) for the construction, at the expense of Mr. Duveen, of a galleryin London specially designed to house these pictures. Sir Hugh Lane was informed of these negotiations.At the end of March 1915 a month after the codicil had been made andshortly before he left for America Sir Hugh Lane, in a conversation withMr. Charles Aitken, Director of the Tate Gallery, made no mention of any changeof his intentions and was informed by Mr. Aitken that the prospects for theprovision of a gallery in London for the permanent exhibition of the pictureswere favourable.Sir Hugh Lane then i.e. in March 1915 stated that he would wait for theresult of the negotiations and would finally decide whether he was to leave the
pictures to London or to Dublin according to the treatment he received from the 1respective authorities. IOn 24th March, 1915, Sir Hugh Lane saw Mr. McColl and on 26th March, I1915, he saw Sir Robert Witt.   To neither did he mention any change in hislintentions regarding the bequest of his pictures as a nucleus for a London galleryif it was provided.These facts are all set out in statutory declarations made in 1917 bvMr. D. S. McColl, Mr. (later Sir Joseph) Duveen, Mr. (later Sir Robert) Witt andMr. Charles Aitken.It is obvious that common &quot;honesty would have made it necessary for Sir hugh lane, if he had had any settled intentions at the time of these interviews of leaving the pictures to Dublin, to have prevented further negotiations for the building of agallery in London to house those very pictures which on this hypothesis hadbeen destined for Dublin.Yet he did no such thing. He allowed the negotiations for the building ofa gallery in London to house his pictures to go on: indeed he encouraged thenegotiations by making it clear that his decision would depend upon the&quot; treatment &quot; he received.Against this evidence there is that of two Irishmen, Mr. A. W. West andMr. G. W. Russell, that Sir Hugh Lane had informed them a few days beforesailing for America that he intended leaving his pictures to Dublin. Thistestimony, however, was not given until 1924; and has been criticised as &quot;unsatis-factory &quot; in a memorandum by the Treasury Solicitor (9th December, 1924).It is submitted that under these circumstances, so far from it having beenestablished that Sir Hugh Lane stood by the codicil, it was clearly established that before his death he had resiled from his intention expressed in the codiciland that he had come to no final decision as between London and Dublin. It wasto depend upon which treated him best.London did &quot;treat&quot; him best; for Mr. Duveen perfected his gift of apermanent gallery in London, to house these very pictures, in pursuance of thenegotiations which had been embarked on upon the strength of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;sstatement to Mr. McColl. The gallery, accepted in 1916, was opened on 26thJune, 1926. Even on this latter date the authorities in Dublin had not taken any steps &quot; to provide a suitable building,&quot; as they would have had to do in order toacquire the pictures by the unwitnessed codicil.Under all these circumstances, which are more fully set out in their memoran-dum of 1919 to the Cabinet, the Trustees of the National Gallery remain, as thevhave always been, unanimous in the opinion that legislation to deprive the trustees of pictures which they legally hold for the people of this country would be basedon no moral principle and would inflict a grave injustice. It would also be a gross breach of faith with Sir Joseph Duveen, who generously built a galleryfor the express purpose of showing these pictures for London. They thereforefeel it their duty to resist what they would regard as an unjustifiable expropriationby legislation.
