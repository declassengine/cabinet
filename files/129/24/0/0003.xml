SCRAP FROM 3HIPBREAKINGMemorandum by the Minister of supply.        General position. There are 29 yards in Great Britain available for&quot;breaking down ships.      They are at present capable of producingsomething over 180,000 tons a year.      Expansion beyond thiswould involve (a) an adequate supply of ships of the righttype,  (b) on increased labour force,  and (c)  additional equipment,e.g.  cranage, burners, transport facilities.      If all these wereavailable it is estimated that    it would be possible to increasecapacity during the course of this year to e, level capable of producing,  say,  350,000 tons of scrap &amp; year.II. Availability of Ships2. It is a pre-requisite of attaining on output on thescale indicated above that the available ships should be ofvaried types.      For example, too many destroyers would throwthe breaking-down out of balance,  partly because working hours on them hove to be limited by reason of the fact that a considerableportion of the plating on them is galvanised end the fumes which arise from cutting galvanised plates are noxious.It is alsj necessary,  to ensure continuity of operations,  to maintain a reserve of vessels with a potentialoutput of at least 50,000 tans scrap.Ships available for breaking up in 1948 should thereforebe of suitably varied types and,  if a scrap output of 350*000tons were mode the objective,  should in the aggregate be suchas to produce a yield of approximately 400,000 tons of scrap.3. Towards such a total there were on 1st January, 1943at the yards in course of scrapping,  or en route for deliveryat yards, vessels (including about 20 destroyers beached in the firth of Forth) estimated to yield approximately 117*000 tonsof scrap.The prospects of additional ships arising in 1948are as follows:-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.__CP.

It wouldnot however in any case be practicable to provide berths toenable work to be started in 19*4.8 on all the 7 battleships andthe aircraft carrier which,  if the Admiralty scrapping programme is fulfilled, will be made available for scrapping this year.Only three,  or at the most, four berths operated by the ship-breaking industry are capable of accommodating ships .jf this size which take 12 - 18 months to break up.      It is cleartherefore that at least four of those large ships (estimated to produce 100,000 tons of scrap) will have to stand over until1949-5. The Navy scrapping programme includes two battleships,four cruisers and one destroyer for breaking up in 19*4-9&apos;These vessels represent approximately 60,150 tons of scrap.Thus from Admiralty sources alone we should begin the year 1949with work in the ship-breaking yards calculated to yield atleast 160,000 tons of scrap;    and this takes no account of anyadditions that may be mode to the Navy scrapping programme during 1948 and 1949*III.      General Considerations6. The preceding paragraphs make it clear that the supplyof shios for breaking up should not in itself be a limiting factor&quot;in either 1948 or 1949 if it were decided to expandcaoacity towards the maximum figure of 350,000 tons a year.More difficulties would be likely to arise as regards labourand equipment. &apos;    Some yards ore already having difficulty in maintaining an adequate labour force:    men such as burners have
to be trained carefully and the turnover rate is high sincemuch of the work inevitably takes place under unpleasantconditions.      And most of the additional equipment required is in short supply.     The capital cost involved (of the orderof  100,000) would not &quot;bo high, but it might be necessary to divert certain items (e.g.  cranes) from essential work at home or from export orders.      If this had to be done on any scalewe might be paying dearly for what would be a marginal tonnageof scrap (satf, 100,000 - 120,000 tons in 19U8 out of total requirements of 11.5 million tons).7* In the circumstances I think that the right coursewill be to proceed on the basis of arranging expansions of capacity in all yards where this can be secured by a relatively small provision of additional plant and facilities and where it will be possible (e.g.  as in Development Areas)to expand the labour force without great difficulty, ratherthan to determine that the industry must be expanded as quickly as possible to the level of 350,000 tons a year.      I proposeto ask the Iron and Steel Board to organise a detailed survey assoon as possible of each shipyard from this standpoint,  and toarrange for expansions of capacity to be put in hand in all appropriate cases.     This is likely to mean that in practicewe should get expanded tonnages ^f scrap from this sourcelater (i.e.  in 19U9 and 1950) than we should by an ail-outexpansion effort immediately.      But inasmuch as our needs of scrap are likely- to be at least as great in those years as in191+8 (since to some extent we are living on capital in the shape of booty scrap and the deliveries from the special appealmade to industry) this should entail no real disadvantage.G&quot;.
