(48) 35) on the 1948 dollarposition, I think my colleagues may be interested to see the attached Report byII the Exports Committee on the probable level of our exports to Canada in 1948.II The broad conclusion is that we can expect exports oi  70 million to CanadaI (and Newfoundland) this year as compared with  44 million in 1947.   Thejj paper also shows that a great deal of effort is being devoted by Departments to1 the problem of increasing our exports to this most important market.   (This isof interest in connection with paragraph 36 of the enclosure to the Chancellorspaper.)I am asking the Exports Committee to conduct a similar review of theaction which has been and is being taken by Departments and of its probableresults as regards our exports to the United States in 1948.J. H. W.Board of Trade, S.W.1,10th February, 1948.EXPORTS TO CANADAMemorandum by the Exports CommitteeIntroductory1. The Overseas Negotiations Committee on 31st December, 1947 (ON (47)69th Meeting, Minute 1), invited the Exports Committee : (a) to review the programme of exports to Canada in 1948 in the light ofrecent negotiations in Ottawa and say what level of exports we could expect to reach;(6) to consider what machinery exists, or should be set up, to watch theprogress of exports to Canada; and(c) to consider the possibility of the establishment in Canada of a smallcommercial agency to introduce British engineering products to canadian industry and generally to promote our engineering exportsto Canada.The Exports Committee have prepared the following report based on information from all the Production Departments and from the Board of Trade.2. It has seemed best, in the first place, to review the various obstacles inthe way of expanding our trade to Canada and the methods of counteracting themalready in practice or under consideration, next to consider the particularopportunities for the sale of United Kingdom goods presented at the moment bythe Canadian market, and finally to note the possibilities of sale expansion in someof the chief industries concerned.34926
Obstacles to Expanding Exports3. One of the chief difficulties, of course, is American competition. First,the Canadians are accustomed, in the case of a large number of the consumerindustries, to goods of the American type, so that they do not readily take tothe United Kingdom version of the same goods. Secondly, a number of UnitedStates companies have subsidiaries in Canada or are otherwise closely linked with Canadian industry. Thirdly, owing to the wide circulation of Americanpapers and magazines in Canada, advertising there is both easier and cheaperfor American than for United Kingdom exporters. Fourthly, American goodstend in a number of cases to be cheaper than those of the United Kingdom.United Kingdom prices are still competitive with American for certain goods(e.g., engineering products), but where there is a margin in our favour it isnarrow and still narrowing. In any case, Canadian consumers have enjoyedthe advantages of an extremely strict price control during war, and are, there-fore, more strongly inclined to resist high prices than almost any other of ourcustomers. Fifthly, the long deliveries offered by British manufacturers,especially for capital goods and engineering products generally, and, in particular,for goods special to Canadian requirements, e.g., electrical equipment, have madeCanadian importers unwilling to place orders with them. Finally, it should be mentioned that certain advantages previously enjoyed by United Kingdomexporters through preferences have been reduced by concessions made by canada to the United States under the recent agreement reached at Geneva.4. In addition, on a limited range of goods, there is a complete prohibition on imports. The effect is not large in relation to total exports to Canada, butincluded among the items prohibited are goods which we could otherwise exportin considerably increased quantities. These cases have been taken up with theCanadian Government, who are doing their best to help where this would not involve a large volume of imports from the United States. There are, however,many signs that the Canadian Government are not prepared to discriminateopenly and whole-heartedly against United States goods.5. On the United Kingdom side exporters have until now often been nervousof trying to enter the Canadian market, largely owing to the strength of canadian and United States competition. During the war the United Kingdom connectionsin the market were necessarily weakened, partly because of the war-time arrange-ments by which the United States became generally responsible for supplying theWestern Hemisphere. Efforts were made in 1946 to induce trade associationsconnected with traditional lines of export to Canada to undertake specialinvestigations in the Dominion, but without much success. Although a numberof firms sent representatives, there was no general approach, largely owing to thefact that most firms&apos; order books were already overfull. It is now possible tore-open this approach in the case of a number of trades whose goods are not subjectto the import restrictions. Finally, of course, there are the ordinary difficultiesbesetting attempts to expand exports to any destination, which resolve themselveslargely into general short supply of items, e.g., some forms of steel, electricalcomponents (such as motors and transformers) which have to be rationed in anycase for export.Special Opportunities for United Kingdom ExportsImport Quotas6. A unique opportunity for United Kingdom exporters to get into theCanadian market is, however, afforded at present by the shortage in Canada ofUnited States dollars. The Canadian authorities promised the delegation toOttawa that they would do all they could to encourage Canadian importers to turn to the United Kingdom for the supplies which they will no longer be ableto obtain from the United States. The quota system of imports is in fact directed,though not openly, against imports from the United States. Followingimmediately upon an announcement of these arrangements, two communicationswere sent to the United Kingdom trading organisations by the Export PromotionDepartment, one directed mainly to firms in the engineering industries, the otherto organisations concerned with the export of the goods covered by quota. Theseemphasised that the restrictions were directed mainly against imports from the
Steps Taken to Increase Exports to Canadaj Prices8.   There is some possibility that the increased restrictions in Canada may! lead to rises in internal prices, thus making United Kingdom prices more nearlyi competitive.  It is, of course, unlikely that there will be any immediate or wideeffects, except possibly in the textile field.Discussions with industry. All departments have taken and continue to take every opportunity ofimpressing on industry the need for increasing exports to Canada. Fuller notesj on the possibilities of expansion by various industries will be found in para-I graphs 12--40 below. It has been found possible to give certain industries special! encouragement by giving ad hoc raw material allocations for firm orders forj Canada (and other hard currency countries) which could not otherwise be; executed.\ Tour of United Kingdom Industry by one of the  United Kingdom TradeCommissioners10. It is proposed that the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner at TorontoI should make a visit to this country; in addition to discussion with departments on further action to be taken, he will undertake a tour of four to five weeks&apos;duration in March in order to widen the interest in Canada as a long-term .market, give United Kingdom manufacturers first-hand knowledge of the new; background to and opportunities for trade with Canada, of the criticisms madeby Canadian import interests, and of the methods which must be adopted toincrease sales.Toronto International Trade Fair11. The Export Promotion Department has been in close touch with theCanadian Government Exhibition Commission in Ottawa and London about theToronto International Trade Fair, which is to be held from 31st May to 12th Junethis year, and has assisted in a number of ways to secure the success of the Fairboth generally and particularly as regards United Kingdom participation. Thisis the first Canadian International Trade Fair. The National Exhibition in 1947attracted an attendance of over 2 million. The Commission decided to acceptonly commercial exhibitors, and made it clear that they did not want any prestigedisplays or information services by Governments. The total number of non-Canadian exhibitors is about 450 from 24 countries, against 600 Canadian.34926 b 2153United States because of the necessity of conserving United States dollars, andthat the new regulations afforded a great opportunity to United Kingdomexporters to increase their trade with Canada. It is too early to assess there actions of industry to these communications.Capital goods7.   One measure that we are attempting to concert to help the canadian government to conserve dollars, and which will specially assist United kingdom manufacturers of capital goods to increase exports to Canada is a system on the[(following lines.   Any project of capital development would be considered by theCanadian Government to see how far dollar expenditure was justified havingiregard to the urgency of the project itself.   In some cases importation of dollarmachinery would be allowed without much question, in others the manufacturerI would be told that no dollars would be allowed.   There would, however, be a&quot;substantial number of cases in which the Canadian Government would find thatjit was possible to require the purchase of some or all of the equipment from theUnited Kingdom (or another soft currency source) provided that reasonableI delivery can be obtained.   Arrangements had been made to ensure that suchleases were brought to the notice of Departments through Canada House and theBoard of Trade so that steps could be taken to secure as many of the orders injthis class as possible.   It now appears, however, that the Canadian GovernmentI are apprehensive about such a scheme on non-discrimination grounds and becausejof the administrative difficulties involved at their end.   Steps are being takento discuss the matter further with them.
Invitations are being sent by the Canadian Government Exhibition Commissionto over 100,000 buyers throughout the world, including 20,000 in Canada and united States. Of the 450 non-Canadian exhibitors the United Kingdom willprovide nearly 200, apart from the indirect participation through Canadianagents and subsidiaries, the extent of which is not known.Progress in Certain IndustriesEngineering Industries12. Capital equipment has already been mentioned in paragraph 7 above.In addition, the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner in Canada has been askedto consider providing details of projects under consideration in Canada.Arrangements have been made for the circulation of this information within theMinistry of Supply to ensure that industries do all they can to provide the. plantrequired.&apos; 13. Special help is being given in particular cases to assist firms to overcomeproduction difficulties. An example is Siemens who have a valuable market inCanada for telephone equipment which they hope to expand greatly.14. General discussions on the possibility of the expansion of trade with canada have taken place with a number of Trade Associations, among them the chemical Plant Manufacturers Association, B.E.A.M.A., British Engineers&apos; and small Tools Equipment Co.. and the Association of British Machine ToolManufacturers. It is clear that there is no lack of willingness on the part ofthese industries to seek for increased exports to Canada and each of these groupswas able to give practical evidence of the seriousness of the efforts it was makingto get into the Canadian market. The Engineering Advisory Council, at its meeting on 4th February, considered a memorandum on exports to Canadaprepared by the Ministry of Supply and the Board of Trade (a copy is attachedat Annex &quot; A &quot;), and fully endorsed the need for sales initiative to take advantageof the new opportunities now available in Canada : and industrial members under-took to reinforce the approaches made to individual sections of the industry, by bringing the views of the Council cogently to the notice of their constituents.15. The prohibition of imports of automobiles of all kinds into Canada hasbeen resolved into a quota scheme commencing January 1948. It is understoodconfidentially from the Canadian Government that United States supplies willbe cut (no details have been received as yet) and identical quotas of $5 millioneach be allotted to other supplying countries, including the United Kingdomand presumably France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, &amp;c, which had a much smallerpre-war performance than the United Kingdom. After discussion with the society of Motor Manufacturers Traders and considering the improved productionposition and expensive sales organisations being developed in Canada by severalUnited Kingdom manufacturers, it is clear that the proposed United Kingdomquota is insufficient. The Senior Trade Commissioner, Ottawa, has been askedto inform the Canadian Government of our views and (at his discretion) eitherto ask for a..1948 quota of $ 10 million or for a global allocation for all the non-dollar supplying countries, assuming that the Continental competition with theUnited Kingdom under a global quota would not be formidable. A global quotashould be in the region of at least $20 million, offering considerable scope to themore progressive manufacturers.Establishment of Commercial Agency in Canada for Engineering Products16. It seems useful at this point to consider the proposal (see paragraph 1)that a firm of United Kingdom consulting engineers should be encouraged to open branch offices in Canada, to follow a precedent in India. It is not consideredthat the same opportunity exists in Canada. Organisations such as the OntarioHydro Electric Power Commission employ their own consultant: there are believed to be several Canadian consultants of good standing, quite apart fromthe activities of the United States firms. 117. Three suggestions have been advanced by the Senior Trade Commis-sioner in Canada: (a) that a United Kingdom firm of consultant contractorsshould open an office in Canada, (b) that an investigator should be sent out to explore the possibilities, (c) that engineering associations should appoint theirown resident representatives.
18. United Kingdom engineering industry is well represented in certainnes in Canada. There is one joint selling agency (covering four importantnited Kingdom firms) and a considerable number of important firms have formedanadian companies, either selling or part manufacture. Others are representedy qualified agents. In the case of electrical machinery for example there haseen a big development in production of all plant for hydro-electric power stationsn Canada. Opportunities are probably limited to smaller machines and equip-..ent. Consequently most power plant appears to be ordered locally withoutResource to public tender. A suggestion recently reaching a prominent UnitedKingdom firm of an opportunity to tender for generators on approval isunfounded,i19. The three suggestions in paragraph 17 are all supplementary to thefisting sales organisation; the following are comments on them: (a) It is not certain that a firm willing to undertake consultant and con-tracting activities would pay its way : Canadian firms prefer directdealings. The suggestion will be discussed with such United kingdom firms as Simon-Carves Ltd.(b) There is probably substance in this proposal for a special investigation.It may be difficult to convince some sections of United Kingdomengineering industry of the extent and continued nature of the oppor-tunity and need for better sales effort without some such report. Itis not to be expected that associations will pay the cost they are known not to have adequate funds This might therefore be Govern-ment organised and paid special investigation.(c) The Joint Secretary of the Chemical Plant Manufacturers association and the Food Machinery Manufacturers Association visited Canadarecently. He considered that there were opportunities not covered bythe existing organisations of his members. It is therefore proposedthat the Director of the Association should visit Canada. This maylead to the appointment of a permanent representative of the Group.20. The question of engineering representation and sales organisation inCanada needs further thought. The views of the Engineering Advisory Councilfended to divide engineering products into three classes for this purpose : (i) those in respect of which satisfactory sales organisation in Canadaalready exists (either in the hands of strong firms or export companiesrepresenting complementary producers and is being energeticallydeveloped;(ii) those in respect of which the market has hitherto been neglected becauseof lack of opportunity, but for which worthwhile opportunity should] now be presenting itself;(iii) those for which opportunities are still lacking because of importprohibitions or other reasons.[The main need was to identify the second class with a view to pressing the sectionsjof industry concerned to take appropriate action. A working party of the Board;of Trade and the Ministry of Supply is being set up to consider the best procedure for following up, whether by sending a carefully selected investigator to Canada orOtherwise.Cotton.21. The target for cotton piece-goods to Canada in 1948 is 100 million square yards. In the August &quot; open export &quot; scheme applications for exports to canada amounted to 10 million yards, i.e., a rate of 40 million a year as comparedjwith 5-3 million for the year 1946 arid 8 1 million for the year 1947. Thismarked increase was obtained without the very strong pressure that has since been put on the cotton industry to step up exports to Canada. Under the november scheme export allocations for Canada amounted to about 15 million yards (i.e., rate of 60 million a year) and a further substantial increase is expectedunder the scheme for the next period which is at present under negotiation,lit will be realised that several months must elapse between the time when pro-duction arrangements for Canada (or any other &quot;market) are sanctioned and thetjtime when finished cloth is available for export, and the main effects of the Augustopen export scheme are not yet apparent in the monthly trade returns. Muchiquicker results are obtained in the case of yarn exports, but the field for expansion
is less in the case of yarn than cloth because throughout the war our yarn exportsto Canada were maintained at a high level. Nevertheless the monthly figuresboth for yarn and for cloth contain some satisfactory features : Exports of cotton yarns and manufactures to Canada, 1947Average- monthlyexportsJanuary-A ugust Yarn............      120,340Piece goods.........        63,450Other manufactures        ...      100,350Total      ......      266,140 276,150       327,000       293,365       406,180The Chairman of the Cotton Board has recently been in Canada to see how-far cotton exports to Canada can be expanded. On his return he will be makinga report which will doubtless contain suggestions on the possibilities.Wool Manufacture22. A paper was circulated to the Exports Committee in November(B.P. (E) (47) 22) on the programme of production for export in the period April/June 1948; this provided for a level of output for export in the period equal,overall, to the target rate for end 1948 and, for Canada, an increase in woolcloth exports from the existing rate of 4-3 million a year to  6 million a year.A similar analysis of output for export in the next period July/September 1948,will be provided very shortly as soon as the present discussions with the trade on the next period&apos;s programme have reached a sufficiently advanced stage. the wool goods exporters are impressed with the further opening created in Canadafor sales of British cloths to United States visitors by the increase from 100 to500 dollars in the value of goods which returning holiday makers from Canadacan now take into the United States without duty. The Wool Export group are sending a Mission to Canada this Spring. Taking all the present factors and trends into account it seems reasonable to anticipate that end-1948 sales of wool manufactures to Canada will exceed those previously estimated. Mean-while, the following figures are of interest: September October November December                         108,040 142,780         96,720 120,84069,600 97,090 107,245 143,42098,510 87,130         89,400 141,920Exports of Wool Manufactures to CanadaTops Yam Cloth	m. lbs.	 &apos;000	m. lbs.	i&apos;000	m. sq. yds.	 &apos;000Total 1947     ......	7-9	1,900	2-7	1,067	14-1	4,940Average monthly Jam-						August 1947	-61	134	-233	85	107	360December 1947	11	337	-226	100	2-03	763Estimate   of   monthly						rate based on end-						1948 target ...	0-8		-25		1-5	Increase in December						over      Jan--August						average	80%		-3%	107%	90%	Hosiery23. A special pool has been created for the yarn requirements of exportersand, whatever happens elsewhere, hard currency exporters&apos; demands are met infull. Exports to Canada in July/October 1947 were  551,578 and for the november 1947/February 1948 period export licences so far approved total 709,840. ^Footwear24. Footwear exporters are given full replacement of materials used forexport plus a 50 per cent, bonus. Special priority leather licences are issued for export requirements, which take precedence over all other requirements, andcertain types of leather have been reserved for supply only against these licences.This reserve of special leather has so far been adequate for all export requirements
but differentiation in favour of hard currency exports would be applied if needed.;The licencing figures for footwear exports to Canada run as follows: PairsJanuary/March 1947 ............       26,868April/June 1947      ...............        95,900July/September 1947 ............      192,328October 1947 ............      ......       32,928Total for ten months    ...    &apos;.........      348,024linen.25. Representatives of the Board of Trade went to Northern Ireland againa few days ago to emphasise to the linen manufacturers the importance ofseizing and making opportunities to sell linen in Canada; the manufacturersreported some very recent signs there of interest in buying. They did not expectmuch increase, but they are alert to the need and assured the Board of Trade that orders would always be accepted and would never be postponed to fill orders from other markets. Most of the linen firms either maintain houses in Canadaor visit frequently but it is decidedly a buyers&apos; market there.Belting.26. Representatives of the manufacturers of belting (narrow fabrics) forwhich the main overseas market is India, say that there are signs of anopportunity to export to Canada which has hitherto bought from the UnitedStates. They are hampered by a limited raw material allocation (heavycount cotton). This is being pursued and the Board of Trade propose, if thefacts are confirmed, to enquire into the possibility of a special increased allocation to this section of the narrow fabric industry.Anthracite.27.   During the negotiations in Ottawa the Canadians were told that wewould be able to supply 150,000 tons of anthracite in 1948 and that we would use our best endeavours to make available a further 100,000 tons.    Negotiationsstarted for the sale of 20,000 tons for winter shipment to Maritime ProvincesI but reached a deadlock over prices.   The view of the National Coal Board is! that they should stand firm on their prices and if the Canadian importers stillj refuse to pay them, the 20,000 tons which they had proposed to ship to thej Maritime Provinces in the winter should be added to the quantity they wouldship to the St. Lawrence market during the summer.   With regard to the St.Lawrence market (which does not open until April), the National Coal board are sending a representative to Canada on a fact-finding mission, the purposeof which is to ascertain : (a) The top prices which this market could stand.(&amp;) The minimum quantity which must be sent in order to retain a footingin this market.Before the National Coal Board decided to send a representative to Canada,Mr. Colin Webster, who handles the bulk of the anthracite trade, had arranged to come to England in order to continue negotiations on the spot. This visit hasnow been postponed.Food and Drink.28. The Ministry of Food have been discussing fully with their CommodityDivisions and with the Food Industries Council the possibilities of increasingexports of goods to Canada.   The Divisions are shortly to report the prospectsi in respect of each of the commodities they control. The Food Industries council will take up the matter with their constituent associations, and a further meetingwill be held as soon as they have had time to get the reaction of their members.The Ministry of Food are circulating to the associations a comprehensive list offood imports during 1947 into Canada from the United States and from theUnited Kingdom, showing the potential gap which might be filled by United[Kingdom exports consequent upon the restriction of imports from the United
States. The scope for expansion is indicated by the following figures extracted from this list: Tons  &apos;000Ex                   Ex Ex                ExUnited States    United Kingdom United States United KingdomPreserves             ........            141 1              109-4 16-8             10-2Sauces, catsup    .........            606-9               21-0 243-0             13-8Biscuits    ...      .........          2,524-1               48-9 306-7             11-0Chocolate confectionery and othersweetened confectionery       ...            358-8              131-2 45-9             25-sugar candy confectionery     ... 296-1 6-6                45-0               1-2Coffee.........      - 221-4 0-3                37-2         .     ...Castile soap        ......... 67-3 ...                    8-1Common soap     ......... 2,971-9 ... 209-1Soap powders     ...      ...      ... 3,375-6 ... 297-229. Far the most important food export is Scotch whisky. The Ministryof Food have suggested to the Scotch Whisky Association that the target forwhisky exports for 1948 should be not less than  2 million out of a total whiskytarget of about  15 million. They have sent to the Association a note preparedas a result of a special enquiry of&quot; the Trade Commissioners in Canada as to thepossibility of expanding consumption of whisky in each of the provinces ofCanada.30. Exports of manufactured foods to Canada are already moving fairlybriskly. The rate of export of biscuits to Canada for 1947, based on the fourthquarter&apos;s performance, was about 1,050 tons a year. Allowing for the increasedtarget for 1948, it might be expected that, other things being equal, exports to canada would reach say 1,600 tons of biscuits in 1948. Actual exports ofchocolate and sugar confectionery for 1947 amounted to approximately 140 tons.There are no. recent figures available but there is good reason to believe that exports are mounting.31. 35 tons of soap were exported to Canada from mid-November 1947(when the scheme for soap exports started) to mid-January 1948. This tonnagecompared with exports in the same period of 1,700 tons to all hard markets (i.e.,Western Hemisphere, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal) of which 1,375 tons went to the Western Hemisphere. A cautious view is taken of prospects of what mightbe exported to Canada, present experience being limited to only two months oftrading.   Moreover, some United Kingdom soap firms have plants in Canada.A agricultural Machinery&apos; 32. The Ministry of Agriculture have had a special talk with the Chairmanof the Export Group of the Agricultural Engineers&apos; Association about thepossibility of expanding exports agricultural machinery, but while the&apos; group are anxious to help as much as they can, they see little prospect of appreciableexpansion. Some of the big firms which supply North America and this country(and which are in process of developing their manufacture over here), such as theMassey Harris Company and International Harvesters, have their own factories in Canada. Moreover, the United States have a strong hold on the rest of theCanadian market, and our manufacturers, with higher steel prices and the atlantic to cross, find it hard to compete. There may be some market for rather&quot;specialised&quot; implements such as potato planters or spraying machines; andif either Fords or Fergusons are able to open up a market for British agriculturaltractors* in Canada there is also some possibility of a demand over there for someof the implements to go with them. But, apart from that, the prospects are notat all good.Furs33. At present, although the United Kingdom buys a large proportion offur skins in Canada, Canada does not in return buy from the United Kingdomany fur coats or any but the smallest quantities of semi-dressed fur skins. TheUnited Kingdom has not so far been able to compete with the United States inthese products, which are now on the prohibited list. There are possibilities of selling the semi-manufactured skins, and the Board of Trade at a meeting withthe Export Group invited the industry to put forward a reasoned case forpersuading the Canadian Government to lift the prohibition on these articles.* The Ministry of Supply is the production authority for agricultural tractors.
jExpert opinion on the possibility of selling the fully-manufactured article islonflicting, but discussions with the industry are continuing. (We have just heard in confidence that the Canadian Government are considering a relaxation of theban on dressed and semi-dressed skins and fur manufactures.)Chemicals ,34. The sales difficulties outlined in general in paragraph 3 apply particu-Jarly to chemicals. ;The Association ,ofT British Chemical Manufacturers have,however, prepared reports on the possibilities of increases, and these reports havebeen sent to the Trade Commissioner in Ottawa for his comments.China Clay35. The leading producer of china clay has been given additional coal onhis undertaking to,export 80 per cent, of the resulting.additional production[(estimated at 175,000&apos; tons per year) to hard currency countries; particularly theiUnited States and Canada. ;   , - H; ,*-nq &apos;m si  ;    T     himBSS^^^^/^X,.11 &quot;:%\ u&apos;r&apos;r. ^^injnoo si waivoi bslumb --r&apos;^* rrsriw Jw%rtRrfo ffcxttiB ad36. The Board of Trade have asked the Manufacturers&apos; Association to write to all the members on the importance of the Canadian market. Carpetmanufacturers need little stimulus in this direction, however, as the Trade and navigation figures of exports to Canada show :-11 months, 1938 ,     11, months, 1946 11 months, 1947115,600 sq. yds. 471,700 sq. yds. 983,200 sq. yds.valued at  53,000: valued at  440,000 valued at  1,032,000Toys Yimixm5 Uni siii i^iwd&amp;W ^!,^rfodfi KsslS,::&apos;&apos;nl &apos;&quot;!\ \ &apos;;i37. The soft toy industry could probably do much for trade with Canada if more raw materials were available, and1 possibilities of increases are beingconsidered. Exports of toys to Canada are increasing :-11 months, 1938 11 months, 1946 11 months, 1947 54,000  154,000 -)     341,000/ ewellery38. About 3 months ago the President of the British Jewellers&apos; Associationmade a tour of Canada investigating market conditions. The total prohibition onthe import of jewellery has destroyed any hopes that arose from it.Plate and Sheet Glass39.

There are,, no special arrangements for allocatingraw materials for orders from Canada and other hard-currency markets.Pilkingtons, who are the only manufacturers, regard Canada as one of their bestlong-term; markets and are in any eventmaximising their export to Canada.Ships &apos;-.V&quot;!&apos;:t&quot;vj Xv^V^HvvsH (nj40. There is little scope for increasing the export of ships,to Canada.Ganada&apos;s principal shipping company; the Canadiaii Pacific^ builds its ships [irithis country and the British yards how have under construction. ;two passengerships of 6,000 gross registered tdhs, one of&apos; which is due to complete in October1948 and the other in January 1949; the total value is  800,000. A few months ago the Canadian Pacific &quot;Railways made enquiries for a further ship, but no34926 r
contract has yet resulted. Canada&apos;s shipbuilding capacity was increased duringthe war and is capable of meeting the requirements for small ships. There is,however, one Canadian enquiry for small canal vessels. Their pre-war suppliersstate that their books are very full and another firm only offers 4 years delivery.The possibility of getting this order accepted is being pursued with the Ship-building Conference.Expected Total Level of Exports to Canada in 194841. Since the original estimate of exports to Canada in 1948 was prepared,the whole export programme has had to be reviewed in the light of the reductionin steel allocations and continuing import restrictions. A new figure of  70million (for Canada and Newfoundland at 1948 prices) was arrived at based onmaximum diversion to Canada, making use of the delegation&apos;? reports of their discussions in Ottawa. This compares with about  44 million for 1947. TheBoard of Trade is at present engaged in reviewing the separate commodity fore-casts within the total  70 million. It is not thought likely that the figure willbe much changed when this detailed review is complete, and it appears to be themaximum which can reasonably be expected during the year.Machinery for Progressing Exports to Canada42. It was suggested that a sub-committee should be formed to watch theprogress of our exports to Canada. The Exports Committee consider that in viewof the importance of ensuring that everything possible is done to increase exportsto Canada, the progress should be watched by the full Committee. A regularreview will be made at intervals of not less than once every three months. A sub-committee of the departments concerned is, however, being formed to consider what immediate steps should be taken to improve engineering representation inCanada.February, 1948.ANNEX A.   &apos;Engineering Advisory CouncilEXPORTS TO CANADANote by the Ministry of Supply and Board of TradeBefore the war Canada was able to balance a deficit in her trade with theUnited States by a surplus with other countries. The deficit with the UnitedStates has increased and the surplus with other countries does not now produceconvertible currency which can be used to balance the deficit. Hence Canada isfaced with a very serious dollar shortage and has been forced to insist that most of the United Kingdom trade deficit with her in the first quarter of this yearshall be covered by a payment in United States dollars. In these circumstances it is of the utmost importance that exports to Canada should be increased.2. To enable her tq meet this dollar crisis, Canada issued an Order in Councilon 12th November, 1947, restricting imports. The Order divides imports into three classes: (a) Prohibited GoodsImports from all sources are forbidden. These include in the engineeringfield certain types of office machinery, refrigerators/ sewing machines, domesticwashing &quot;machines and wringers, cinema projectors, motor vehicles, radio sets,cameras, gramophones, air conditioning equipment, and a number of domesticelectrical appliances. (Motor vehicles will shortly be transferred to the quota list;)
(b) Goods subject to quotaEngineering items are cutlery, clocks and watches, guns, rifles and otherfirearms. The quota for any country is 200 per cent, by value of pre-war imports.(c) Other Metals or ManufacturesThe import of these may be restricted. A list of capital goods has been drawn up and the Canadian Ministry of Reconstruction and Supply will reviewrequirements for these goods in order to reduce the drain on Canadian dollar resources.3. In operating this system of import restrictions, Canada is anxious toavoid the appearance of discriminating against goods from the United States.In practice, however the restrictions (particularly those described at 2 (c) above)are likely to lead to a considerable increase in enquiries from Canada for british goods. The Appendix to this paper gives some statistics of recent exports to canada.4. Though the recent mission to Canada, which negotiated the trade agree-ment, was mainly concerned with food and raw materials, it discussed with the canadians the prospects for export of machinery. The following difficulties werelisted as among the chief handicaps to an increase in exports : (a) Long delivery dates.   We have lost many orders to the United Statesbecause they could deliver much more quickly.(6) The unsuitability of our types for Canadian requirements.(c) The inadequacy of our servicing arrangements.(d) The practice of Canadian subsidiaries of United States companies ininstalling the types of machinery used by their parent companies.(e) The inadequacy and unsuitability of the representation of Britishengineering industry in Canada. As a result, our goods are not sufficiently well known in Canada.(/) The fear of the United States as competitors which has made some of ourmanufacturers hesitant about trying to get American business. Onthe other side, Canadian importers have been equally hesitant abouttrying to place orders in the United Kingdom.5. To overcome these difficulties the Mission have suggested that manu-facturers should make a special effort to quote earlier delivery dates, to studyCanadian requirements, provide proper servicing facilities and improve theirrepresentation in Canada. It is realised that it may not be possible for each largefirm or even for each branch of the engineering industry to appoint a regularagent in Canada. The volume of business in the immediate future would not warrant this and, moreover, it would be difficult to find good people who werefree to take on the work. But it might be possible for the various major groupswithin the industry to co-operate in establishing in Canada organisations whichwould be capable of investigating and advising on the prospects for theirrespective groups and, at the same time, of interesting Canadian purchasers inthe possibility of buying in the United Kingdom. It would be essential for therepresentatives of the United Kingdom industry to be able to talk in technicalterms to their potential customers.6. The encouragement of exports to Canada is a matter of long-term aswell as short-term policy for the following reasons : (a) The Canadian dollar is one of the small number of currencies which, for as long as can be foreseen, is likely to remain hard.(&amp;) Canada is likely herself. to remain short of dollars for a considerable period and will therefore be compelled to find some means of increasingher imports from non-dollar sources.The Governments policy was given in the following statement on 18th December,when the details of the trade agreement were published : &quot; The United Kingdom Government will take all possible steps toencourage exports to take advantage of the improved opportunities inCanada provided by the recent Canadian import regulations.&quot;7. The suggestions of the Council are invited as to what practical steps theengineering industries can be encouraged to take to promote sales of engineering products in Canada.
