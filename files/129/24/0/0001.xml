(47) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 1).2. It will be observed from paragraph 4 of the report that the following three questions are dealt with in a separate memorandum which is being circulated as E.P.C. (48) 8 :-(i) Should Palestine leave the sterling area?(ii) Should Palestine sterling balances be blocked?(iii) Should the Palestine Currency Board continue to operate ?3.   The following is a statement of the recommendations for which approvalis desired : A. Oil Interests (paragraph 14)It is recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should seek to establish withthe United Nations Commission that: (a) All agreements between the Palestine Government and the Iraq petroleum company Limited and Consolidated Oil Refineries Limited, respec-tively, should be treated in accordance with Chapters, paragraph 3 (d),of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union, i.e., that they shall continue to be valid according to their terms, unless modified byagreement between the concession-holder and the State.(b) The British oil companies in Palestine should be free to export petroleum products to such destinations as they choose.It is further recommended that Sir A. Cadogan should be asked : (c) To give early warning of any hint that the Commission may be consideringdollar-invoicing the products of the Consolidated Refineries Limited.B. Assets and Liabilities (paragraph 30)It is recommended that in his negotiations with the United Nations Commis-sion Sir Alexander Cadogan should ensure that: (a) A clear distinction is drawn between Palestine Government assets andassets of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(&amp;) That the vesting of land directly in the Service Departments is dulyacknowledged as full and clear title of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentDepartments, with freedom to dispose of such assets as they may deemdesirable should they not be disposed of before the termination ofthe Mandate.It is further recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should be asked : (c) To discuss with the Commission plans for the safe custody of such storesleft behind by the military, and for their movement to the Haifaenclave for subsequent evacuation, possibly an appreciable time after1st August.It is further recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should be asked toestablish the following principles : (d) That the surrender of Palestine Government assets is conditioned on theunqualified acceptance of the liabilities incurred by the Palestine34832\Copy
egitGovernment must be free to control the finances of Palestine as shedeems necessary in the interest of Palestine as a whole, and(7) That adequate arrangements are made to indemnify His Majesty&apos;s Gov-C. German Assets (paragraph 38)It is recommended that a final decision on implementing the policy whichwould best serve His Majesty&apos;s Government^ interests financially, described in(a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 37, should await the report of the Treasury repre-sentative now in Palestine, it being understood that so far as can be determined atpresent any alternative to the policies advocated in (a) and (b) must definitelyresult in serious loss to the Exchequer, some of which will be in terms of lowerreceipts of hard currency (Swiss francs from German assets in Switzerland).D. Safeguards for Commercial Interests (paragraph 44)It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan should be asked : (a) On the treatment of goods, to discuss the question with the Commissionon the lines proposed in paragraph 41.(b) On the treatment of nationals, companies and shipping, to secure anundertaking from the Commission that, while they are responsible for administering the territory, they will grant to United nation nationals, including juridical persons, national and most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters pertaining to commerce, industry,shipping, civil aviation and other forms of business activity withinPalestine, subject to the reciprocal grant of similar treatment in likematters by the United Nation concerned to Palestinian nationals.This undertaking would be understood to be subject to any exceptionscustomarily included in commercial treaties. Similarly the provisionswith respect to reciprocity granted by each of the United nations would be understood to be subject to the exceptions customarilyincluded in the commercial treaties concluded by that State. TheCommission should also be asked to ensure that, in handing over to the successor States, if and when established, a similar undertaking validfor a period of at least two years is obtained from them.E. Exports from Palestine (paragraph 46)It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan be asked to request the united nations Commission to facilitate the exports of citrus and potash to the UnitedKingdom.F. Procurement of Food-stuffs and Fertilisers (paragraph 51)It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan be asked : (a) to inform the United Nations Commission that we will maintain existingsponsorship, procurement and shipping of food and fertiliser supplies for Palestine which will be required up to 15th May, the latest date forthe termination of the Mandate;(b) to inform the United Nations Commission that we will accept no direct responsibility for sponsorship, procurement and shipment of supplies required subsequently;(c) If the United Nations Commission request us to continue as agents pro-procurement and shipment of food supplies, to refer to the foreign secretary&apos;s undertaking in the House of Commons on 12th december to render assistance to smooth out the transition, and to state that he must seek instructions, but to give no indication that we should beprepared to act as agents in this matter for any considerable period.useTreasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st January, 1948.Note-During the period between the appointment of the United Nations Commissionand the termination of the Mandate, the Mandatory Power shall, except in respect of ordinaryoperations, consult with the Commission on any measure which it may contemplate involving the liquidation, disposal or encumbering of the assets of the Palestine Government, such as the accumulated Treasury surplus, the proceeds of Government bond issues, State lands or any other assets.
SECRET22nd January, 1948CABINETFINANCIAL AND  ECONOMIC  QUESTIONS  ARISING  FROM  THEWITHDRAWAL OF BRITISH AUTHORITY FROM PALESTINEReport of the Overseas Negotiations CommitteeIntroductoryTHE Overseas Negotiations Committee were asked to prepare, for considera-tion by Ministers, a comprehensive paper on financial and economic questions arising out of the withdrawal of British authority from Palestine (CM. (47)93rd Conclusions, Minute 1).2. This report has been prepared on the basis that as far as practicable itshould be assumed that the United Nations plan will be put into effect. Infact, however, as far as can be foreseen, the Palestine Arabs supported by theArab States will boycott the United Nations Commission and refuse to co-operate in the establishment of an economic union of Palestine administered by a jointeconomic board. Unless the Commission is furnished with a force by the united nations for the maintenance of order, it seems likely that guerilla warfare andconfusion will reign in the areas evacuated by British troops. The confusion maywell be increased by the migration of Jews and Arabs from areas where theyare in a minority. The Jews will probably have to defend themselves within an enclave limited by military requirements; the remaining part of Palestinewill be in Arab hands but is unlikely to be constituted as an Arab State since this would represent acquiescence in the partition plan. Where, therefore, anybreakdown of the United Nations Plan would vitally affect our financial andeconomic interest in Palestine the relevant portion of the report will point thisout and the recommendations will take account of it.3. Very broadly the United Nations Plan provides : (a) that the mandatoryPowers shall hand the administration of Palestine over to a Commission appointedby the United Nations which shall establish Arab and Jewish States and an inter-national State in the City of Jerusalem; (b) that these States shall be unitedin an economic union of Palestine among whose principal objectives will be a customs Union and a Joint Currency system providing for a single foreign exchange rate; (c) that there shall be established a Joint Economic Board, whosefunctions will be to implement either directly or by delegation the measures necessary to realise the objectives of the Economic Union. Until the JointEconomic Board is functioning (if indeed it ever does) the United nations commission will have full responsibility for financial and economic administration.4.   A separate submission is being made by the Treasury, proposing that (a) Palestine should leave the Sterling Area;(6) Palestine&apos;s sterling balances should be blocked; and(c) the Palestine Currency Board should continue to operate for the present.The rest, of this paper has been prepared on the assumption that these proposals are. approved. (If Palestine&apos;s sterling balances are to be blocked, it will benecessary for the Committee to consider the level of the releases to be made.)Oil Interests .,5.   Palestine is highly important to the British oil position, since oil produced in Iraq by the Iraq Petroleum Company is piped by them across Palestine tothe Company&apos;s tank farm near Haifa, from which they feed crude oil to the34832 :^!&apos;!&quot;,!- s$ ni bwsnoo -.-. i&amp;di iM\mo siiMi orfo to itOtfioq   &apos;
Consolidated Refineries Limited. Approximately 2 million tons per annum of crude oil are now derived from this pipeline and 1 million tons each are shippedon British Companies&apos; account from Tripoli and the Persian Gulf. It is hopedthat the refining capacity at Haifa will be increased to produce from 7-9 million tons per annum by 1951, using the increased quantities of crude oil which shouldflow through the new pipeline now under construction.6. The crude oil produced by the Iraq Petroleum Company is owned asto 47  per cent, by British interests, as to 23f per cent, by United States interests,as to 23f per cent, by French interests, and as to 5 per cent, by a Mr. Gulbenkian.The Consolidated Refineries Limited are 100 per cent. British-owned.7. The Iraq Petroleum Company and Consolidated Refineries Limitedoperate in Palestine under agreements with the Palestine Government due to expire in January 2001 and October 2003, respectively. In the United NationsPlan of Partition with Economic Union, Chapter 3, paragraph 3 (d) stated&quot; Commercial concessions granted in respect of any part of Palestine before suchadoption of the resolution by the General Assembly shall continue to be validaccording to their terms, unless modified by agreement between the concession-holder and the State.&quot; The operation of the two companies should be protected by this article. The Iraq Petroleum Company have, however, a number of otheragreements with the Palestine Government and Municipalities involving such considerations as mining rights, water projects, occupation of land, &amp;c, whichthey would also wish to have safeguarded.8. Because of the shortage of refining capacity throughout the sterling area and the rest of the world, the loss of the refinery at Haifa, or any attempt by thelocal government to restrict or direct export of petroleum products, or to interferewith imports of machinery, raw materials and crude products, essential both for normal requirements and maintenance of the refinery and pipelines and for expansion schemes, would have a most serious effect on the oil situation in the sterling area. Palestine and other neighbouring States draw their requirementsof petroleum products from the refinery at Haifa and interference with theproduction or the products would, therefore, also have serious repercussion on those States. It would also seem to be against the interests of a Jewish successorGovernment in Palestine to take any action which would close Haifa refineryor restrict its activities, since this would lose for them an important source ofrevenue. Current annual expenditure by the British Oil Companies on loadingdues, taxes, rents, wages, purchase of local materials and capital costs is estimatedat about  5-25 million, and will be considerably higher when the expansion schemes have been completed and are operating.9. At the moment the Refinery Company never owns the oil that it processes.It is remunerated on a fee basis and, as its sole shareholders are Companiesthat distribute the refined product, this fee may be less than would be charged by an outside concern. There is a possibility that the successor Government willbe attracted by the opportunity of earning hard currency or gold presented bythe existence of the refinery on its territory. Assuming that it respects the termsof the convention signed by the Mandatory Government in 1933, it cannot secure an appreciable return from the Company by way of taxation or port dues certainlyuntil 1958 and probably not before the beginning of next century.10. The successor Government may, however, attempt to secure an exchangeprofit either by (a) insisting^ that the Refinery Company increases its processing fee to thefull &quot; economic &quot; level and receives some part of the fee in gold orhard currency, or 0(6) more likely-laying down that all oil refined in Palestine must be soldfor dollars.Whether the successor Government will really give way to this temptation isunknown. If it did and succeeded the result would be extremely serious. Theproduction of the Haifa refinery will increase during the next few years Ifthe oil companies have their way the British share alone will be 7  million tonsin 1950 and the difference in cost between the crude oil intake (for whichpresumably we would charge Palestine dollars in the circumstances envisaged)and refined oil output is of the order of  20 million at. present prices.11. Alternative 10(a) therefore would mean our paying a fair proportionof this amount in gold; alternative 10 (b) would mean paying in dollars for thatproportion of the Haifa output that was consumed in the sterling area
v .12, . On the other hand, we are not without weapons with which, to opposesuch an attempt,by.the successor Government,.e.g., (a) we could refuse to proceedwith the expansion of the: refinery and the pipeline across Palestine which this involves, (6) refineries wear out pretty quickly and we could in the last resort(and at considerable expense to ourselves) transfer the refinery, elsewhere,(c) dollar-invoicing is a game at which two can play and Palestine must take an appreciable part of her imports from the sterling area:13. For the.moment it is difficult to see what can be done to ward off theprospect of the successor Government adopting such tactics. We certainly, donot want to delay the expansion of Haifa longer than we are already likely tobe forced to delay it by shortages of plant and material. On the other hand if;during the discussions, there is any hint that we are going to be faced with this sort of demand, His Majesty&apos;s Government should have early warning in order-to reconsider the policy in regard to the refinery.13a. It should be mentioned that the Iraq Government have expressedanxiety about the future of the Haifa refineries in view of their interest in the exports of Iraqi oil through that port.13b.  The effect of the establishment of a Jewish State on the existing andprojected pipelines also requires careful examination.   Arab States may weilmake difficulties over way-leaves of pipelines whose terminals are to be in theJewish State.  American pipeline construction may be difficult in Arab countries for some time to come;ORecommendations14. It is recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should seek to establishwith the United Nations Commission (a) that all agreements between the Palestine Government and the iraq petroleum Company Limited and Consolidated Oil Refineries Limitedrespectively should be treated in accordance with Chapter 3, para-graph 3 (d). of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union, i.e., thatthey shall continue to be valid according to their terms, unless modified by agreement between the concession-holder and the State;(&amp;) that the British oil companies in Palestine should be free to exportpetroleum products to such destinations as they choose.It is further recommended that Sir A. Cadogan should be asked (c) to give early warning of any hint that the Commission may be consideringdollar-invoicing the products of the Consolidated Refineries Limited.&quot;Assets and LiabilitiesFixed Assets in Palestine of His Majesty&apos;s Government15. Details of the value of the fixed assets constructed by the Service Depart-ments in Palestine have been requested from the Middle East but this information has not yet been received. It is believed that the bulk of the assets are sitedon requisitioned, hired and expropriated land. Many of these assets are ofmilitary value only but others would have considerable civilian-use value. TheService Departments are endeavouring to sell the assets which have been con-structed on freehold land, but sales of assets of major ^political significance will only be made with the concurrence of / the Palestine Government.16. In the absence of the report referred to, only very tentative estimates of the value of the assets can be made, but the salvage value of assets constructedon hired, requisitioned or expropriated land is believed to be of the order of 2 million and the value to a willing purchaser would probably be substantially higher:&apos;/&apos; ,f:sm?.i .-: .r JbaS;      ,;,-(s&amp;/io8  - [.17. It is the view of the Palestine Government that if titles remain intheir present form; i.e:, vested in the High Commissioner, there might be a difficulty ini asserting&apos; the rights of the Service Departments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in this land after the termination of the Mandate when the officeof&quot; the High Commissioner will presumably cease to exist. This land was vestedoriginally in the High Commissioner on behalf of the Service Departmentsconcerned, presumably to avoid any question arising of challenge under Article 5of; the Mandate, but it seems clear; tKatr the provisions, of this article ,were not&apos; 34832   &quot;    &quot;&apos;. C:\&apos;:Z &apos;  * b 2
84intended to preclude ordinary acquisition of private rights to land, cf. leasesgranted to foreign consulates and the British Army in Palestine. \i18. It is the conclusion of the High Commissioner that the safest arid most effective means of protecting the interests of His Majesty^Government in tinsland is to vest it directly in the Service Department concerned, either by &amp;special ordinance or otherwise, and he has so informed the Military authorities concerned in Palestine. It is their policy to endeavour to sell off all immovableassets with the least possible delay but, both because this may mean considerableloss and because in the time and with the staff available it may not prove possibleto dispose of all property, some such method of protecting His Majesty&apos;governments interests appears necessary,  ioMovable Assets19. The only known movable assets of His Majesty&apos;s Government remaining in Palestine after the termination of the Mandate will be military stores. a detailed note on these is given in Appendix B.Liabilities of the Palestine Government20. The appointment of a United Nations Commission as an administering authority for the whole of Palestine to take over the administration of the countryfollowing the termination of the Mandate involves the question of the negotiations to be carried out for the surrender of the assets of the Palestine Government andthe terms upon which such a surrender should be made. In such negotiations itis essential that clear distinction is drawn between the assets of the palestine government and the assets of His Majesty&apos;s Government.21. The Commission will, no doubt, be guided by the financial clauses ofthe Plan of Partition with Economic Union and these present some difficulties as to the definition of the obligations of the Palestine Government, the meanswhich would be available to honour the obligations taken over by the Commissionand the handling and distribution of governmental movable and immovable assets.22. The assets of the Palestine Government might be summarised asfollows : (i) General revenue balances,(ii) Funds for specific purposes.(iii) Funds in respect of Public Debt.(iv) Government lands, buildings and stores.(v) Internal loans.(vi) Trust funds.(vii) Palestine 3 per cent. Defence Bonds and Palestine Savings Certificates.23. The liabilities of the Palestine Government might be summarised asfollows : (i) Budgetary expenditure until termination of the Mandate.(ii) Public Debt. &quot;(iii) Specific obligations in respect of. the right of public servants, includingpensions, compensations or gratuities.(iv) Specific obligations under Palestine i Ordinances,(v) Contingent liabilities.24. These assets and liabilities are individually dealt with in Appendix B,except for the special problems arising on the Public Debt of Palestine and on pension obligations, which are explained in the following paragraphs.25.   The Public Debt of Palestine consists of :-(i)  P.3,600,000-3 per cent.Guaranteed Loan, 1962-67; /(ii) War Loan (Bearer Bonds), 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th issues, totalling: 5,791,960. &amp;The 3 per cent. Guaranteed Loan, less stock redemptions, at 31st March, 1947,stood at  P.3,150,000. This stock is guaranteed as to principal and interest hvthe Treasury under an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland entitled&quot; The Finance Act, 1939 &quot; (24 and 25George V, cap. 32).      y -       -     .-. ..    :;. 26- ,Tne operationof the Joint Economic Board to be set up under the Par-titiori Plan makes provision for the service of the outstanding public debt of the
57Palestine Government. An agreement with the United Nations Commissionsafeguarding the servicing-of the 3 per cent. Guaranteed Stock and War Loans(Bearer Bonds) should be a major objective of our financial negotiations.Pension Obligations - *27: - Palestine Government have pension obligations under PalestineOrdinances as well as obligations in connection with the Palestine Provident Fund,Widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pensions Fund. In addition, the Palestine Governmenthave not yet finalised their views as to the payment of compensation and gratuities to public servants and to the police on termination of the Mandate. Preliminaryviews of the Government of Palestine have indicated that their proposals may involve a sum of  P. 18 million on the basis of &quot; funding &quot; pensions. However, itmay be possible to arrive at some more economical method of meeting the charge.The position of expatriate officers of the Palestine Civil Service will need carefulconsideration. In the main it is hoped that the majority will be found other employment in the Colonial Service but there may be a small residue who cannotbe so placed for some while after the termination of the Mandate.Qualifications on A cceptance of Financial Obligation28. 3 (a) of Chapter 3 of the Report of the United Nations Ad hoc committee on the Palestinian Question imposes a qualification as to the financial obligations which the State shall respect and fulfil. While saying that all finan-cial obligations of whatever nature assumed on behalf of Palestine by theMandatory Power during the exercise of the Mandate shall be respected and ful-filled, there is the important overriding condition that such obligations would be those recognised by the State. The United Kingdom delegation has reserved HisMajesty&apos;s Government^ position regarding any clauses in the Plan, and we mustresist this qualifying condition to the extent of making the unqualified acceptanceof the obligations of the Palestine Government a condition for the surrender of itsMeans of Meeting Obligation29. Then there is the question of the means which the Commission willemploy to meet certain charges arising out of the obligations taken over. Asto the servicing of the public debt and the cost of superannuation benefits nowbeing paid or falling due in future, the Partition Plan envisages these chargesas being met from the common revenue of the Joint Economic Board. This pre-supposes that this Board will be set up and function satisfactorily; but this wouldappear to be a doubtful proposition in present circumstances. Should there be difficulties in setting up (a) the respective States, which seems probable in the caseof the Arab State, and (ft) the Economic Union, the Commission may not be ina position to implement its agreement to discharge the liabilities taken over unless there are safeguards against such a contingency......     r ,Recommendations30. It is recommended that in his negotiations with the United nations commission Sir Alexander Cadogan should ensure (a) that a clear distinction is drawn between Palestine Government assets andassets of His Majesty&apos;s Government,(ft) that the vesting of land directly in the Service Departments is dulyacknowledged as full and clear title of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment departments with freedom to dispose of such assets as may seem desirable should they not be disposed of before the terminationof the Mandate.It is further recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should be asked (c) to discuss with the Commission plans for the safe custody of such storesleft behind by the military, and for their movement to the Haifaenclave for subsequent evacuation, possibly an appreciable time after1st August.It is further recommended that Sir Alexander Cadogan should be asked toestablish the following principles : , (d). That the surrender of Palestine Government assets is conditioned on theunqualified acceptance of the liabilities incurred by the Palestine Gov-ernment (there is every indication that the liabilities will exceed theliquid assets);
(e) That notwithstanding clause, 2 of Section E o ^ Chapter 4 of theUN S C.O.P. Report (see footnote), as long as the mandatory periodlasts, Palestine-Government must be free to control the finances otPalestine as she deems necessary in the interest of Palestine as a whole,(/) That adequate arrangements are made to indemnify His^ Majesty&apos;sGovernment in respect of their guarantee of Palestine 3 per cent.Guaranteed Stock, and for payment of superannuation benefits.German External Assets in Palestine31 The General Background.-^ the decision of the Berlin Conference otJuly-August, 1945, it was decided that, &quot;the reparation claims of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and other countries to reparations shall be met. . ...and from appropriate German external assets.&quot; By the provisions of Article oof Part I of the Final Act of the Paris Conference on Reparation, &apos;&apos; each signatoryGovernment shall, under such procedures as it may choose, hold or dispose ofGerman assets within its jurisdiction in manners designed to preclude thetrreturn to German ownership or control and shall charge against its german reporation share such assets.&quot; Article 2 of Part IV of the Final Act statesthat &quot; the signature of each contracting Government shall be deemed to mean that the effect of the present Agreement extends.....to territories under itsprotection or suzerainty or over which it at present exercises a mandate.&quot;Under Article IF of the Final Act of the Paris Conference on Reparation, theInter-Allied Reparation Agency must charge the reparation account of eachSignatory Government for the German assets within that Governments juris-diction, and each Signatory Government is required to render a return of thevalue of such assets as defined under Article 6 of Part I of the Agreement. HisMajesty&apos;s Government signed the Paris Agreement on the 21st December, 1945,when it exercised a mandate over Palestine. Under the Final Act of Paris the share to be allocated to the United Kingdom (including all areas under itsjurisdiction) of the total of German external assets, known as Category A, whichare found to be available, is 28 per cent. This means in effect that the UnitedKingdom is entitled to 28 per cent, of the total of .all German assets in all the eighteen countries signatory to the Final Act of Paris, which includes the UnitedKingdom, *plus any other external assets, e.g., those made available in neutral countries.32. The position of German assets in Palestine under the international arrangements described above, and His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s responsibility inregard thereto, is thus : (1) While these assets are within His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction-(i) His Majesty&apos;s Government is required to see that German enemyassets in Palestine are so dealt with as to preclude their returnto German ownership or control;(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Government must ensure that, while these assetsremain under her j urisdiction, as at j present, the value of them is included in the United Kingdom returns to the Inter-AlliedReparation Agency;(iii) the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency is required to chargeHis Majesty&apos;s Governments share with the value of these- German assets in Palestine;(iv) it is. possible that His Majesty&apos;s Government may escaperesponsibility for accounting for such German assets inPalestine as remain unliquidated when Palestine ceases to be within His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction, if it can be shown that circumstances have rendered His Majestv&apos;s government.      impotent in respect of these assets; &apos;    &quot;(v) all assets in liquid form at the time when Palestine ceased to come within United Kingdom jurisdiction would be accountable toI.A.K.A. by United Kingdom whether transferred or not.Note.-During the period between the appointment of the TJhited&quot; Nations Comniission and. S&quot;, .99^mmm. W any measure which it may contemplate involving thehquidat,on^disposal or encumbering of the ^ssets of the Palestine Government such as the accumulated Treasury surplus, the proceeds of Government bond issues, Sta&quot;ds o^any other
(2) All accountable German assets in Palestine are included by the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency in determining the total of Category Aassets for reparation purposes, and all German assets in Palestine as defined for I.A.RA. purposes are reparations.German External Assets under the Control of the Custodian of Enemy Propertyfor Palestine33. The total estimated value of these assets is  8-8 million, and there areadditional assets of perhaps twice this value belonging to Germans interned inPalestine and in Australia, and other Germans resident in Germany. these latter assets, or the proceeds of their sale, may be released to such of the ownerswho may not be within the legal (Custodian) definition of &quot;enemy.&quot; Suchreleased assets would not be accountable to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency.After adjustments made under I.A.R.A. accounting rules for external assets thefinal sum hitherto considered as likely to be included ultimately in Category Ain respect of German enemy assets in Palestine is  4 million. The amount ofthis at present in liquid form is probably less than  1 million.Steps taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure control and transfer ofGerman enemy assets in Palestine34. The High Commissioner for Palestine has been asked to instruct theCustodian of Enemy Property for Palestine not to vest further any Germanproperty which may have to be released (e.g., internees&apos; property). He has alsobeen asked to consider measures whereby as much of the immovable property aspossible can be liquidated. The High Commissioner has also been asked to advise on the possibility of transfer to the United Kingdom of all liquid assets now available and which become available as the proceeds of sale of assets. Arrange-ments have been made for an immediate visit to Palestine by a Treasuryrepresentative to investigate the position on the spot and see what steps it wouldbe practicable and wise to take in the direction of liquidation of assets and transfer of the proceeds.Possible Financial Effects35. In the first estimate of German assets within the United Kingdomjurisdiction which has been made to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, thesum of approximately  2 million has been included on account of these assets.The provisions of the Paris Act enable us to adjust this estimate later accordingto the facts. The fact that we are obliged to account for assets, the value ofwhich we know for certain, e.g., because they have been liquidated, but are unablein fact to secure the transfer to the United Kingdom Exchequer, would mean that our participation in other assets under Category A of Part I of the FinalAct, would be reduced. One effect of this might be to reduce our share of Swissfrancs derived from the disposal of German assets in Switzerland. this reduction would not be the equivalent of the value of German assets in Palestinewhich we had included in the I.A.R.A. return, but would definitely reduce our share to an extent which at the moment cannot be forecast.Jewish Claims for reparation payments36. The Jewish Agency have hitherto claimed that, as compensation for the sufferings of Jewry under the Nazis, Palestinian Jews should receive compensationout of reparation payments over and above that already provided for in theFinal Act. This provision (Article 8, Part I) allocates $25 million from german assets in neutral countries, and non-monetary gold in Germany and other assets in Germany, making an overall total of approximately $30 million. Jewishpropaganda will no doubt claim that morally the whole of German assets inPalestine should be earmarked for this purpose. The Jewish Agency has alreadybeen informed that contributions from reparations for the rehabilitation of non-repatriable victims of German action are governed by the Final Act of Paris.Any contribution to Palestine over and above the agreed Palestine share of reparation can only be made at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Goverment, whoseresponsibility it is to account for all these assets, the non-receipt of which would adversely affect the reparations receipts of the United Kingdom Exchequer. as these assets are reparations the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency has a responsi-bility to see that they are included in the total pool of Category A assets.
Conclusions ;37.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs interests would best be served financiallyif:- &apos;     &apos; - .   .   .(a) All liquid assets were transferred out of Palestine and within the ]uns-diction of the United Kingdom, before the mandate was relinquished.(b) As much property as possible was henceforth liquidated before themandate ended&quot; (provided that it is transferred as in (a) above).(c) In the arrangements to be made with the United Nations Commission,we secured the inclusion of a statement describing the internationalresponsibilities as regards German assets in Palestine which remainunliquidated, and therefore not transferred as in (a) and (6) above,and also secured from the United Nations Commission a recognitionof these responsibilities which, so far as it was able, the commission would accept as dischargeable to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agencythrough His Majesty&apos;s Government.   (A primary responsibility isthat these assets are so held or disposed of as &quot; to preclude their return to German ownership or control &quot; Article 6a, Part I of theFinal Act of Paris.)It is clearly recognised that to take the lines described in (a) and (6) may,even with the most skilful presentation of the facts as to the position of these assets, and their setting within the field of international reparations relations,be the occasion for bitter accusations that we are robbing the Palestinians ofGerman assets which belong to them.   This is a matter which lies very close tothe hearts of Jewish refugees from Germany in Palestine.   There are severalgood answers which, in a reasonable atmosphere, should completely rebut suchaccusations, viz. : (1) Provision has already been made out of reparation assets for sufferingJewry. The provision in the Final Act (Article 8) is relativelygenerous. It amounts to about $30 million which is equal to above5 per cent, of all Category A assets or to the combined shares of norway and the Netherlands.(2) These assets should form part of the whole pool of German externalassets and would be applied by the United Kingdom to meet the claims of all the colonies, some of whom were more hardly hit than Palestine,e,g., Malta.(3) Palestine, under the arrangements contemplated for dealing with theGerman assets under United Kingdom jurisdiction, will receive herjust proportion of the United Kingdom&apos;s share of 28 per cent.38. A decision upon action designed to accomplish (a) and (b), and as to (c),turns very largely on what is found, particularly as regards (a), in Palestineby the Treasury representative to be practicable, and, so far as can be judged from the Palestine end, least likely to plunge the whole question into a hopelessatmosphere of unreason and prejudice.It is recommended that a final decision on implementing the policy whichwould best serve His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs interests financially, described in (a),(b) and (c) of paragraph 37, should await the report of the Treasury representativenow in Palestine, it being understood that so far as can be determined at presentany alternative to the policies advocated in (a) and (b) must definitely resultin serious loss to the Exchequer some of which will be in terms of lower receipts of hard currency (Swiss francs from German assets in Switzerland).Palestine&apos;s Membership of International Economic and Financial Bodies39. The Official Committee on Palestine are reviewing and making recom-mendations on all international obligations (including, e.g., membership of inter-national, economic and financial bodies) assumed by the United Kingdom on palestine&apos;s behalf. toSafeguards for Commercial Interests40. We need to safeguard our commercial position in Palestine in the interim period between the laying down of the Mandate and the negotiation of long-term agreements with the successor States. . Our object should be to negotiate an arrangement with the Commission which will safeguard our position, notonly while the Commission is actually administering the territory^ but for an interval thereafter sufficient to give us time to negotiate commercial treaties withthe successor States. It follows that we shall have to try to persuade theCommission to place some restraints on the economic freedom of the new states for the first year or two of their existence.
Treatment of Goods41. The protocol of provisional application of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade does not extend to Palestine until notice has been given inaccordance with paragraph 2 of that protocol. It is undoubtedly in our interests that Palestine should apply the rules of the agreement on tariffs and trade.It is for consideration whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should, while theyare still responsible for the administration of Palestine, give notice in accordancewith paragraph 2 of the protocol to extend the application of the General Agree-ment on tariffs and trade to Palestine. The Palestine Government are being consulted on this point, but, subject to their views, it is proposed that we should give notice of the provisional application. If this proposal is approved,Sir Alexander Cadogan should presumably first inform the Commission that thisis what His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to do, since Palestine will obtainthe tariff concessions negotiated at Geneva only if she in her turn makes herconcessions effective, and seeks the agreement of the Commission to the adoptionof this course, and to their carrying forward the application when they takeover. The Commission should also be asked to ensure that in handing over tothe successor States, if and when established, a similar undertaking valid fora period of at least two years should be obtained from them.42. We can support our request by reference to the fact that, under theterms of the Mandate, Palestine was bound to grant equality of treatment to thegoods, nationals, &amp;c, of all members of the League of Nations (and by a separate agreement to the United States) and that this had to be given even if one of thecountries concerned discriminated against Palestine. The line our representative should therefore take with the Commission is that Palestine has always followeda policy of non-discrimination in commercial matters and it is hoped that thepolicy will be continued under the Commission^ regime, and further, that for thefirst two years of their existence the successor States shall be under an obligationto grant most-favoured-nation treatment to all members of the United nations that accord the same to them.The above general rule of non-discrimination would not be applied in such away as to prevent Palestine making special customs agreements with neighbouringterritories, cf. the existing preferential tariff arrangements with Syria andLebanon.Treatment of Nationals, Companies, Shipping and Civil Aviation43. When the Mandate is terminated we shall have no treaty fights inPalestine for our nationals, their businesses or our shipping and civil aviation.In the long term these can only satisfactorily be safeguarded by the negotiation of a treaty of establishment and navigation with the successor States. It will notbe practicable to negotiate detailed provisions with the U.N.O. Commission, andto cover the position in the interim period we shall have to rely on a modus vivendiexpressed in fairly general terms.R ecommendations44.   It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan should be asked (a) on the treatment of goods, to discuss the question with the Commissionon the lines proposed in paragraph 41;(b) on the treatment of nationals, companies and shipping, to secure anundertaking from the Commission that, while they are responsible for administering the territory, they will grant to United nation nationals, including juridical persons, national and most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters pertaining to commerce, industry,shipping, civil aviation and other forms of business activity withinPalestine, subject to the reciprocal grant of similar treatment in likematters by the United Nation concerned to Palestinian nationals.This undertaking would be understood to be subject to any exceptionscustomarily included in commercial treaties. Similarly the provisionswith respect to reciprocity granted by each of the United nations would be understood to be subject to the exceptions customarilyincluded in the commercial treaties concluded by that State. TheCommission should also be asked to ensure that, in handing overto the successor States, if and when established, a similar undertakingvalid for a period of at least two years is obtained from them.34832 r.
Exports from Palestine which are Essential to the United Kingdom45.   The main exports from Palestine of interest to the United Kingdom(other than petroleum products covered in paragraphs 5--14) are : (a) Potash;(&amp;) Food-stuffs, mainly citrus fruit and fruit products.Separate notes on these are in Appendix C.Recommendations46. It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan be asked to request the united nations Commission to facilitate the exports of citrus and potash to the UnitedKingdom.Procurement of Food-stuffs and FertilisersFoodstuffs47. The Ministry of Food has hitherto dealt with the programming, spon-soring and procurement of food supplies for Palestine.48. Requirements of bread grains and rice for part of 1948 have alreadybeen considered by the I.E.F.C. The Food Mission in Washington have beenasked within the last week to submit to the I.E.F.C. requirements of oils and fatsfor Palestine, as part of general Middle East requirements.49. Certain quantities of the allocated foods for 1948 have been or are in course of being procured. Some small balances of Palestinian 1947 requirementsyet remain to be shipped.Fertilisers50. The United Kingdom sponsors the requirements of the Colonies and mandated Territories with the International Emergency Food Council in Wash-ington. The only fertiliser now under international allocation by that body isnitrogen and the allocation of this fertiliser to Palestine for the fertiliser seasonending 30th June, 1948, is 2,667 metric tons of N. Of this total, the UnitedKingdom is to supply 1,267 tons, Belgium 1,100 tons and Norway 300 tons.United Kingdom deliveries are made through LCI. (Levant), but procurement ofsupplies within the Belgian and Norwegian allocations is made by the palestine government, with such guidance as may be required from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. It has been the practice in the past for the Palestine Government to use theLCI. (Levant) for procuring all supplies of nitrogen, but recently Norway hasappeared to be unwilling to continue this arrangement.Recommendations51.   It is recommended that Sir A. Cadogan be asked (a) to inform the United Nations Commission that we will maintain existingsponsorship, procurement and shipping of food and fertiliser supplies for Palestine which will be required up to 15th May, the latest date for the termination of the Mandate;(6) to inform the United Nations Commission that we will accept no direct responsibility for sponsorship, procurement and shipment of supplies required subsequently;(c) if the United Nations Commission request us to continue as agents pro-procurement and shipment of food supplies, to refer to the foreign secretary&apos;s undertaking in the House of Commons on 12th december to render assistance to smooth out the transition, and to state that he must seek instructions, but to give no indication that we should beprepared to act as agents in this matter for any considerable period.52.   Approval is sought for the following recommendations : (a) Oil interests (paragraph 14). ,(by Assets and liabilities (paragraph 30).(c) German assets (paragraph 38).(d) Safeguards for commercial interests (paragraph 44).(e) Exports from Palestine (paragraph 46).(/) Procurement of food-stuffs and fertilisers (paragraph 51).22nd January, 1948.
APPENDIX AStores in Palestine; There are large quantities of military stores (Naval, Army and Air Force)in Palestine. A considerable proportion of these stores constitutes part of the approved maintenance and reserve stores for the Middle East garrisons and theArmy generally, and with the existing and prospective stringency of financial provision for the Services the necessary replacement of such stores, if they had tobe abandoned in Palestine, would be extremely difficult. It is essential that every effort should be made to withdraw all military stores, which we desire toretain, from Palestine as part of the general evacuation of that country by theForces.The evacuation of military stores from Palestine has already begun andis to proceed pari passu with the general evacuation of the Forces through thefour stages of Plan A, as recently approved by the Defence Committee and endorsed by the Cabinet. The latest review of the situation suggests that, providedconditions permit the planned orderly evacuation, it should be possible to withdraw the bulk of the stores required elsewhere. There will, however, be an additional quantity of some 150,000 tons of useful stores which would have been requiredhad the Forces remained in Palestine. Immediate replacements will not berequired elsewhere, and, since it is not possible to evacuate them, these stores willremain for local disposal by the Ministry of Supply. There is a considerablerisk that we may lose even their disposal value. This is not a contingencywhich can be lightly accepted, and the Cabinet have agreed that special measures,including the appointment of an officer charged with this particular task, shouldbe taken to facilitate first (a) the collection and evacuation of military stores from Palestine;(b) the disposal of surplus stores in Palestine.There are two developments in the Palestine evacuation, the possible effects of which upon the stores question Sir Alexander Cadogan should be asked to bearin mind in negotiation with the United Nations authorities. First, it seems possible- and the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, think it is probable thata considerable quantity of stores will in any case have to be left behind at various stages of the planned evacuation of troops. It is proposed that plans shouldbe discussed by Sir Alexander Cadogan with a view to the safe custody of suchstores left behind by the military, and (a) to their movement to the Haifa enclavefor subsequent evacuation, or (6) to their disposal, possibly an appreciable time after 1st August. Secondly, deterioration of conditions in Palestine as betweenthe Jewish and Arab communities, the premature arrival of the United nations commission, or other factors, mav enforce some telescoping of the militaryevacuation plan now approved in favour of a more rapid withdrawal upon theHaifa enclave. The Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, foresee that any suchcontingency would probably mean a heavy additional abandonment of stores along the line of evacuation. In this event, too, it would be important that such provision as may be possible in the circumstances then existing should be made for(a) subsequent concentration and movement of the stores to be evacuated into theHaifa enclave, and their safe custody there pending shipment overseas; and (b) the subsequent disposal of the stores declared for disposal. If a hurried evacuationwere forced upon us through the United Nations Commission insisting upon what we regard as a premature arrival in Palestine, then there would be a powerfulargument for insistence upon all possible facilities being provided for theevacuation of military stores which thus had to be temporarily abandoned.It is relevant also that the evacuation of military stores, on present plans,will be slowed down by the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the PalestineAdministration not to interfere with the citrus trade, which is so important to palestine&apos;s economy; this consideration likewise affords ground for seeking somequid pro quo as regards facilities for subsequent evacuation of stores.34832d
APPENDIX BNotes on Assets and Liabilities1. General Revenue Balances.-Th.ese are estimated as likely to be of theorder of  2 million at 31st March, 1948. This allows for some slight recessionin revenue returns offset by savings in expenditure through inability to carry outthe budgetary programme. This figure might well turn into a deficit if revenuesslumped to an extreme degree. No forecast is possible as to the likely positionof revenue balances at 15th May; given favourable conditions it may be possibleto hold the position as at 31st March. -2.   The funds for specific purposes include the following: (i) Palestine Provident Fund.(ii) Palestine Widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pensions Fund.(iii) Palestine Post Office Savings Bank.(iv) Public Service (Supplementary Grants Board).(v) Renewals Funds Ports, Posts and Telegraphs, Water Supply, &amp;cThe foregoing, with the exception of (v), must be utilised to meet theobligations of the funds they relate to. In the case of (v) these funds (which amount to approximately  734,000) could be treated either as an asset of Govern-ment to be handed over or utilised for appropriate expenditure on the services for which they were created.3. In addition to the sinking fund arrangements for the servicing of the3 per cent. Guaranteed Stock (dealt with in paragraph 12, the sum of  3,048,707,being the unspent balance of the various issues of War Loans (Bearer Bonds)has been invested by the Crown Agents in the interests of the bondholders. Afurther  500,000, which had been earmarked for a specific purpose, is also being invested.,4. Government land and buildings are proposed to be dealt with underthe Partition Plan by allocating immovable assets to the Government of theterritory in which they are situated. This may well present difficulties in thecase sf-- he-proposed Arab State&quot;; but in our financial negotiations we shouldhand them over to the United Nations Commission as a Palestine Governmentasset and the Commission would be responsible for their subsequent disposal.5. Internal Loans, these consist in the main of loans to various municipali-ties, to Citrus growers, local councils, village communities and agricultural loans.The foregoing have been made from Palestine general revenues at interest onvarying terms of repayment. In addition, loans have been made to Municipalities,Railways and Ports from the proceeds of the War Loans (Bearer Bonds). these loans are assets of the Palestine Government for disposal as may be agreed.At 31st March, 1946, the loans from revenue totalled  P.5,245,206 while from war Loans (Bearer Bonds) loans of  P.1,282,000 had been made.^ 6. Trust funds consist of Museum of Archaeology Endowment Fund,Russian State Fund and Smith (B. C.) Trust Fund, which must be negotiatedwith the Commission in the light of the respective Trust deeds.7. Palestine 3 -per cent. Defence Bonds and Palestine Savings Certificateswere inaugurated under a Palestine War Loan Ordinance of 1941 for the purposeof lending the proceeds to His Majesty&apos;s Government to meet war expenditure.These bonds and certificates were issued on prescribed terms of redemption; inthe case of the 3 per cent. Defence Bonds, seven years from the date of purchase,and in the case of saving certificates the normal ten-year period. Earlier repay-ment may be possible if this concession would secure satisfactory arrangements asto the servicing of the 3 per cent. Guaranteed stock, relieving His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of her guarantee on being given satisfactory indemnification as dealtwith in paragraph 40.8. Budgetary expenditure may well not be possible on many projects owingto labour and material difficulties; but the result is reflected in the estimatedGeneral Revenue balance given.9. Obligations under Palestine Ordinances. There may well be a numberof obligations under Palestine ordinances which may need to be given adequatecover. These, in the main, deal with requisitioned lands and compensation pay-ments and will require to be negotiated.   The legal aspect generally in connection
with Palestine Ordinances is being dealt with by the Colonial Office and it is mentioned here because certain financial obligations may arise for negotiation.10. Contingent liabilities. It is difficult at&apos; this stage to envisage what maybe contingent liabilities; but there may well be items of stores and supplies whichmay not be brought to account on the termination of the Mandate. Such claimsmust obviously fall to be met from Palestine assets.APPENDIX CA. Palestine PotashBy a long-standing agreement with the Palestine Potash Company the wholeoutput of potash is taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on a cost-plus 12^ per cent,profit basis. This potash is used to meet in part the requirements of the UnitedKingdom, Dominions and Colonies, and the present arrangement continues theprocedure approved by the International Emergency Food Council during theperiod when potash was subject to international allocation. Allocations of potashceased on 30th June, 1947. The company, under a British and PalestinianDirectorate, hold a concession for 75 years from 1934, granted by the HighCommissioner on behalf of Palestine, and also by agreement with the King of trans Jordan on behalf of that territory in which a part of the concession lies.Royalties are paid to Palestine and to Transjordan.2. The potash from the concession area contains a high percentage of K-and this high-quality fertiliser is indispensable to the food production of theUnited Kingdom and the Empire. Potash of this quality to replace any short-fall on Palestine supplies cannot be obtained from other sources and it is essentialto ensure that the existing supply arrangements, which are favourable to thecompany and to His Majesty&apos;s Government, should be continued after the sur-render of the Mandate. His Majesty&apos;s Government have supplied capital equip-ment and granted a loan to the company and it is largely due to the support given,and the assured market provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government, that the company have been able to continue in operation and build up a sound position.3. Royalties under the terms of the concessions are paid to the palestine government and to the Transjordan Government. It is assumed that thePalestine Government^ share of the royalties will be paid to the Commission onthe termination of the Mandate.4. There is, in fact, likely to be interference with potash production, since,it is understood, that the works of the company are located partly in the Arab andpartly in the Jewish proposed States.B. United Kingdom Imports of Food-stuffs from Palestine1.   These comprise the following estimated quantities for 1948 : Tons &apos;000 ^&apos;000(a) Citrus fruit 1947-48 crop      ...           387 8,453(6) Citrus fruit juices for soft drinks              2-1 376(c) Concentrated orange juice (forWelfare Foods Scheme)     ...              3-5 733Id) Essential oils    .........      165,000 (lb.) 100(e) Wines   (including   sacramentalwines)............            ... 207-5   -9,869-5105,000 tons of the 1947-48 citrus fruit crop have been shipped, the balanceremaining to be shipped up to April 1948.
2: Imported citrus fruits and products from Palestine are a large 5sourceof United Kingdom supplies/ amounting to notless than 75^per cent, of ^UnitedKingdom citrus fruit imports and to 50 per cent, of requirements for soft drinksand the welfare service.3. Our citrus fruits are bought from individual shippers within the frame-work of an overall agreement with the Citrus Marketing Board.&apos;]. jWje fhpulcj hopethe Board would continue to function. If it did not, we should have to buy direct from the shippers. The season ends in April and begins again in the late autumn.The fruit juices are bought through London agents.
/E.P.C.(U8) 821 ST JANUARY,   19U8.7CABINETECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEEPALESTINE AND STERLINGMemorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer in this Memorandum I deal with the question whetherPalestine (and Trans-Jordan) should remain a member of the sterling Area and whether her balances should be blocked.A number of other financial and economic questions arisingout of our withdrawal from Palestine are dealt with in asecond memorandum which is being circulated separately(E.P.C.(48) 7).2. I have come to the conclusion that it is necessaryto remove Palestine and Trans-Jordan from the Sterling Area.The High Commissioner agrees, and urges that it should be onthe 1st, 8th or 15th February.We should choose the earliest of these three dateswhich is administratively practicable - probably 8th February.I attach (Annex I)  the draft of a public statement about Palestine&apos;s withdrawal from the Sterling Area, the blocking of her balances and the future of the Currency Board.3* Palestine&apos;s normal trade position shows a heavydeficit,  partially offset hitherto by heavy British military expenditure and by the Jewish Agency gift - dollar scheme.Even with these, and in spite of movements of capital into palestine on private Jewish account, her sterling balanceswill have been reduced in 1947 by some  20 millions.      On30th November,  1947, they stood at  98.2 millions, and on present guesses, they might be reduced by some  33 millions in 192+8.      This figure projects post experience and does not allow for possible future capital movements arising out ofdistrust.Such a rote of withdrawal is altogether beyond what we con afford.      It would be quite out of line with othersettlements we hove made and provoke demands from India,Egypt next time,  and many others.4*      - The balances are not concentrated in the hands of a central Bank, so that (even if there were on &quot;opposite number&quot;with which to make on agreement) we should still hove to takepositive action in the United Kingdom.    This action should beby a Payments Order which,  coupled with the exclusion ofPalestine and Trans-Jordan from the Scheduled Territories, conmake any movement into or out of a Palestine account (or any
1 9lei)smaller grouping of such accounts) subject to specificTreasury permission.      That permission can take the form ofcircular instructions to &quot;bankers stating what transactionsthey may pass (e.g.  personal transactions on private accounts),and what must &quot;be referred to the Bank; of England.      Accountsor transactions which are not sanctioned, either generally or specifically, are described in this note as &quot;blocked&quot;.5. ,    The problem is to determine what amounts, and whatclasses of accounts,  should be liberated.      The following proposals are put forward to deal v/ith balances at30th November,  191+7, viz:-  million(i) Government 10.1(ii) Commercial 1+1+. 1(iii) Currency Board 1+3*2(iv) Loan to His Majesty&apos;s 0.government&apos; --;98. 2(i) Government balances  10.1 million the Overseas Negotiations Committee recommend(paragraph 30(d) of the Annex to e.p.0.(1+8) 7), that the surrender of Palestine Government assets is conditional on the acceptance of the liabilities incurred by thePalestine Government.      It would be reasonable to make anyreleases subject to Treasury permission until satisfactory arrangements have been made to this end.      But immediatepermission might be made for the release of say  1 million as a working balance.(ii) Commercial balances  1+1+. 1 millionBalances of private individuals (not included in this figure) need not be blocked at all.      This will obviatea mass of detailed administrative work,  including any questions about returning British subjects, etc.      Thequestion is thus confined to the restriction of the useof the London Balances of the Palestine banks, and thereleases should be concentrated on these.      Under thenormal drill&apos;,  any new accruals of sterling will be credited to free accounts.      Since this is the season when sterlingflows in from Ministry of Pood fruit purchases, we neednot worry unduly about working balances.      It is suggestedthat the position up to the end of 192+8 would be amplycovered by releases totalling  12 millions, of which  1+millions would be called working balances,  and the remainderwould be a release &quot;in respect of 191+8&quot;.      The ForeignOffice point out,  however,  that it may be undesirable to prejudice the.position after we relinquish the Mandate,and ask that the release should be specifically related to the period up to the 15th May, - 191+8, the latest date for relinquishing the Mandate,  leaving releases in respectof the rest of 191+8 &quot;for negotiation with the united nations Commission&quot;.      The point is a good one, but theappropriate figure of,  soy,  3 millions up.to 15th May,. 191+8,  leaving  5 millions for the rest of 191+8, may appear on the low side.      It is nevertheless on a generous scale,
but political consideretions no doubt make it essentialto avoid any appearance of non-cooperation.      Consultationwith the High Commissioner as to the apportionment of thereleases between the banks concerned has been put in hand.(iii) Currency Board  h-3.2 millionNo blocking action should bo taken.      The board should continue tu function for the present, subject toany necessary changes in procedure.      It should betreated as a resident in the United Kingdom (which it is)so that it requires permission to pay sterling to anyresident outside the sterling area.      Blanket permissionshould be given for payments in respect of PalestineCurrency notes,  to be made to the blocked account of anyof the Palestine banks for account of the person presenting the notes.      (The Banks would also have permission to paysterling to the Currency Board from blocked accounts in exhange for Palestine notes).      Other payments of sterlingby the Board would be subject to permission, which wouldbe given freely in the case of returning British nationals,but rarely otherwise.This means that,  as in the case jf India, the circulation cannot be contracted to pay for imports inexcess of the total annual sterling releases permitted.Palestine pounds can be held either as a currency or asa bank balance in Palestine,  and con &quot;be turned into importsonly to the extent to which the import licensingregulations of Government permit it.      The import licensingpolicy itself must be conditioned by the total annualsterling releases permitted.      Balances could not betransferred to other ports of the Sterling Area (&quot;e. g.South Africa) in order to evade our control.(iv) Loan to His Majesty&apos;s Government  0.8 millionNo action seems called for. . The result of this action will almost certainly be toleave Palestine in serious trouble over the 191+8 Balance ofPayments with the rest of the v/orld.      But Palestine must facerealities,  and if she is ever to be viable,  it must be byachieving a balance on current account.      Meanwhile, we cannotbear the burden alone,  and it is for American-Jewish money to fill every gap caused by our restriction on the use of sterling balances.      If some of these dollars have to be turned intosterling to meet a deficit with the sterling area,  so much the better.      On the other hand, Arab importers have no suchresources,  and it would be reasonable to set aside about \ million to be at the disposal of the Palestine control tomeet demands which they are satisfied would not otherwise be met.      This $1 million would have to cover all such expenditure outside the sterling area.7.       American reactionsNo doubt attempts will be made to misrepresentwhatever action we may take.      But haying regard to the explicitprovisions of the Anglo-American Financial Agreement, exceptioncannot be token to a reasonable limitation on the drawing down of Palestine&apos;s sterling balances.      Although we have notblocked any Colonial sterling, we have token very vigorous stepsto see that it is not substantially reduced,  and if we achieve-3-
our objectives, wo shell treat Palestine much more favourablythan any Colony.      The proposals above are already morefavourable than the treatment given tc India, Egypt, Brazil,Uruguay,  etc.8.       Trans-JordanThe High Commissioner recommends that Trans-Jordanmust go out of the Sterling Arws at the seme- time as Palestine.It is very difficult to achieve a complete separation of trans-Jordan funds from those of Palestine.      But there need be no objection to making s complete release, for use byTrans-Jordan only,  of any balances which the banks concernedcan segregate as being assets of their Trans-Jordan branches.Notes had better follow the Palestine drill, at least untilTrane-Jordan can arrange to use a separate currency.Thereafter,  any Palestine notes circulating in Trans-Jordancould be redeemed against payment of sterling by the PalestineCurrency Board to the new Trans-Jordan Currency authority,whatever it is.      Such sterling would be free of restrictions,being in the hands of a resident in the sterling area.      Itis probable that Trans-Jordan will arrange to separate hercurrency from that of Palestine in future,  either issuingher own, run by a Currency Board,  or by using Iraq currency.Once that is accomplished, we can consider her re-admission to the sterling area.9*       The Future(i)    Government balances would be released for paymentof the liabilities of the Government of Palestine.(ii) Commercial balances could be gradually released inthe light of circumstances it is not yet possibleto foresee.(iii)    The assets of the Palestine Currency Board couldeventually be turned over to whatever new authoritybecomes responsible for the Currency,  againstsurrender of the existing circulation as it wasreplaced by a new currency.      Any balances v/would have to remain as a reserve of the (old) CurrencyBoard against notes not collected by the newauthority,  until some satisfactory arrangementcould be made to provide for the rights of theirholders.When the new Currency Authority comes into existence,  an adjustment will be necessary in therelease mechanism,  so that the whole of thereleases shall be under the control of the newAuthority, who will be able to apportion them attheir discretion.(iv)    Dollar Releases.      In view of the American links,I see no need to make any provision forconvertibility into any currency other than sterling.Palestine can utilise her dollar availabilities tosecure any other currency she may need.      But wemay have to consider some small dollar provisionfor the Arabs,  and certainly for Trans-Jordan.10.        The Statistical PictureFigures provided by the Bank of England are given in annex II.P. 3. C..Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.21st January,
ANNEX draft statement the approaching termination of the Palestine Mandatehas made it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to considermost carefully what financial arrangements should be male inthe interests of the successor Governments in Palestine andof the sterling area in order to preserve the resources ofPalestine for the use of the new States and to safeguard thebalance of payments position of the United Kingdom.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government are resolved to do all in their powerto prevent damage to the financial and economic structure of Palestine during the period of their withdrawal.During the period of the Mandate, Palestine has beena member of the sterling area.      She is also the holder of sterling balances,  the present total of which is about 100,000,000,  a large amount in proportion to the size of thecountry.      These balances have been drawn on rapidly in recent months.      This drain obviously cannot be allowed to go on.It would mean that the resources of Palestine    which will be needed for the development of the country would be in dangerof being unduly depleted.      The drawing down of the balances in this way would also aggravate the balance of payments problem of the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area.As in the case of other countries holding largebalances - e.g.  India, Egypt and Iraq - the only way in whichthe drain can be stopped is by blocking the greater part ofthe balances.      His. Majesty&apos;s Government have decided therefore,for the reasons given above,  that the balances of Palestinemust be similarly blocked and have taken steps accordingly.In order immediately to provide the resources necessary tocarry on Palestine&apos;s normal international trade, His Majesty&apos;s
Government will make svaileble during the interim period andsubsequently,  the resources which they ore satisfied arenecessary.For immediate requirements  x millions are being released in order to provide  y millions as working balancesfor the banks in Palestine and  a millions to bw usedtogether- with current accruals of sterling, which will be atPalestine&apos;s disposal for current expenditure until themiddle of May.The amounts of these releases have been arrived atafter careful consideration and consultation with the present administration and His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied thatthey should prove amply sufficient to enable Palestine to meet all her needs during that period.      Future policy for release from the sterling balances will bo the subject of consultation between His Majesty1s Government&apos;o representative at the united nations,  Sir Alexander Cadogan,  and the Commission forPalestine which is now being established by the United Nations,and the views of the Commission will bo given full consideration in the formation of policy in regard to future releases.As soon os the Joint Economic Board is established, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will also initiate discussions with thatBoard for the same purp -so.In the special circumstances of Palestine, whereHis Majesty&apos;s Government must assume that,  for a period atleast,  a thorough and comprehensive exchange control will belacking, the blocking of the balances would not entirelysafeguard the resources of Palestine,  so long as the countryremained in the sterling area.      If His Majesty&apos;s Governmentallowed a situation to continue in which such leakages couldoccur, they would not be carrying out their responsibilities to the sterling area or to Palestine.      They therefore considerit desirable in the interests of both that Palestine should not
1agremain a member of the sterling area -and she has ceased to bea member therefore from .&quot;.................  the date on whichthe balances have been blocked..    Should the SuccessorGovernments desire it, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be readyto discuss with them the question of their readmission to the sterling area.As regards currency arrangements,  the existingCurrency Board, subject to any necessary changes in procedure,will continue to function in the interests of the holders of currency and of Palestine generally pending an orderlytransition to whatever arrangements may in due course be modefor the future management of the currency.      His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hope it will be possible to arrange for the united nations Commission,  if they so desire,  to appoint arepresentative to act as an observer at the deliberations ofthe Currency Board.
13ANNEX IIPALESTINE;    BALANCE OF PAYMENTS &quot;.7111-1 REST OF VfORLD(Amounts in   millions)1i     Palestine&apos;s Balance of Payments is at present dominated by two factors, (a) heavy military expenditure &quot;by the U.K. and (b) support fromJews in America both in cash and kind.2.      The attached statements (which in view of the intended withdrawalmake a purely arbitrary guess, a&quot;t -hat  military expenditure will be in1948) exclude goods imported free under the Jewish Agency Gift-dollarScheme.     No figures for such imports are available in London but byassuming them to be roughly equal to the difference between recordedimports and recorded payments to U.S.A. and Canada/ (not an entirely satisfactory method over a short period) the balance of payments on current   account may bo set out more revealingly as follows:-  millions	1946	1947	1948Imports (c.i.f.)		74	73Exports (f.o.b.)	lift	19	25Deficit on visible trade	- 35	- 55	- 48Net invisibles (including oil)	-	+   2	-   1Deficit on ordinary account	- 35	- 53	- 49Jewish Agency Gifts (very conjectural) :   in cash in kind	+   6 *   3*	*  4 4-    7	* 5 * 5	- 25i	- 42	- 39Military expenditure	+ 23	* 18i	+   8Cost of camps in Cyprus	-	-   1	-   2*Deficit on current account	^2	- 24i	--33*		*          &apos;	--So far as the U.K. is concerned	the forecasts	in the tables	are mostly based on Departmental estimates;    those for U.S.A., Canada,South and Central America are based on telegrams 1987 and 1988* from palestine.4.     The bulk of the expenditure during the first half of 1948 on thecost of camps in Cyprus represents monies already owing and is due for early settlement.5. As at present forecast Palestine&apos;s sterling balances are likely tobe drawn down during 1948 by 33&apos;g&quot;.19th December, 1947/ The difference between imports from and payments to Canada suggeststhat Jewish Agency dollars are also being used to purchase goods inCanada.T.197-48
