(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TCP. (48) 5918TH FEBRUARY, 1948CABINETSTATEMENT ON PERSONAL INCOMES.  COSTS AND PRICESAGRICULTURAL prices memorandum by the Minister of. Agriculture and FisheriesWhile I am in agreement with the general views expressed by the Minister of Labour and National service in his memorandum (CP.(48) 54), there is one particularfeature of the procedure for fixinp; agricultural prices for vrtiieh allowance must be made in applying the rulesproposed in paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 54*     This is theundertaking given by the Government in November, 1946, asregards the price adjustments which would follow a special review.     The position is set out in the attached copy ofa letter which I sent to the Prime Minister on11th February,&apos; 1948,  and I feel that I should, remind mycolleagues of this commitment.T.W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1.,18th February, 1948.COPY NO.    ^ G
annex copy of letter of Ufa February, 1948,from the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries to the Prime Minister.There is one aspect of the policy Statement on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices which vail almost certainly be raised in tomorrow&apos;s debate and which I feelwill require careful handling.On 21st November, 1946, with the authority of theLord President&apos;s Committee (L.P.(46) 37th Meeting,Conclusion 2 (1)) I made a long statement in the House onthe principles and procedure which would govern the annualand special reviews of agricultural prices.      This statementof policy later formed the basis for Part I of theAgricultiiro Act, 1947*When the&apos; question of a wages policy statement wasunder consideration by the Cabinet last September myParliamentary Secretary, Mr. Collide,   (in my absence) drewyour attention to the need for giving the farming communityan assurance that the statement then proposed would not inany way derogate from the undertaking that they were givenin November, 1946.     I enclose a copy of the letter for convenience.You will remember that after you made your statement on 4th February Mr. Turton asked -&quot;Are these principles to be applied in thecase of the February price schedule ofagricultural prices,  and if so will theright hon. Gentleman consider amending the Agriculture Act recently passed?&quot;and you replied -&quot;That does not arise out of this statement&quot;.I shall be very surprised if the question is not further pressed in tomorrow&apos;s debate by agricultural members(possibly from both sides of the House) and I think it maybe helpful if I set down the position, briefly, as I see it.Personal. Incomes,  i*e. agricultural wages and farmers&apos;  incomes:The general considerations set out in paragraph 7of the White Paper apply without qualification.     In their application to agricultural porkers1 wages it is desired thatthey should be borne in mind by the Agricultural Wages Boards;in their application to farmers&apos; incomes it is intended total them into account at the annual February reviews..
Prioe-fixing (paragraph 10 of White Paper):Annual FebruaryJReviows:    The Government have always reserved corap 1 eto&quot;&quot;freedo.n at those reviews to reach decisions on the level of prices to be fixed in the light &quot;ot al1, &quot;bhe relevant factors (statement of 21st November, 192+6).The position is not affected by the policy statement of 4th February, 1948.Special Reviews;      In the statement of21st November, 194b, we undertook -&quot;That on the occasion of any future special review occurring between February Reviews(and on those occasions only) the objectiveshould be to effect by means of priceadjustments a change in the aggregate grossincome of the industry (rela&quot;.;od to the price review coramodities) corresponding to the sudden and substantial change in costs of producing those commodities which has occasionedthe review&quot;.The justification for this was, and is,  that ifthere is a sudden and substantial rise in costs (e.g. anincrease in wages awarded by the independent members of theAgricultural Wages Board in spite of the opposition of the farmers&apos;  representatives) after prices have been fixed andfarmers have made their plans and, probably, planted theircrops, the margins which were considered by the Governmentto be appropriate.and necessary for the production programme which farmers have embarked upon should be restored, v/ithoutprejudice of course to the Government1s lull right to reducemargins for future production at the follov/ing February reviewif such action was considered appropriate to a new production programme.This principle of an assured price fixed in advance in relation to an agreed production prograjimie and an estimated level of costs is a fundamental feature of our food production policy and I earnestly hope that in anyinterpretation of paragraph 10 of the White Paper which maybe given tomorrow the integrity of our explicit and repeatedassurances to the agricultural industry on this subject willbe fully preserved.I am sending copies of this letter to the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland.ENCLOSURECopy of letter of 24th September, 1947.from the Joint parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of A.griculture and Fisheries tothe Prime LlinisterMy Minister as you know has had to ask to be excusedfrom tomorrow&apos;s Cabinet.     He has,  however, asket. me to send to you the following comment on his behalf on the Interim
Report of the Working Party on Stabilisation of Wages.CP. (47) 261+.He regards the Statement in Annex &apos;B*  of this paper as very well suited to its purpose and has no amendments to suggest to it.     He has,  however, the following point onthe last paragraph.     As it stands this might appear to theagricultural community to override the firm declaration ofthe Government&apos;s policy for agriculture announced with theauthority of the Cabinet en 21st November, 1946, in whichrevised procedure was laid down for regulating agricultural prices.     In that declaration the Government undertook thatwhore there was a substantial rise in costs such as an appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage occurringbetween the annual February reviews,  there should be an automatic increase in agricultural prices sufficient tocover the increase in costs.      It is implicit in the newagricultural production programme and in the provisions ofPart I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, that this procedure shallbe followed and effect was given to it in connection withthe recent increases in the minimum agricultural wage lastmonth.     We should endanger the full co-operation of theagricultural industry in carrying out this programme ifthere were any feeling in their minds that the Government *undertaking of November last will not continue to be fullyhonoured.In the Minister&apos;s view   that need not interferewith the issue of the statement as drafted provided that heis authorised to give the faming community an assurance that it does not in any way derogate from the undertaking that they were given in November last.

Cabinet Office, S.W.1.20th February, 1948.note the attached memorandum(CP. (48) 60) is circulated for consideration under Item 2of the Agenda for the Meetingof the Cabinet to be held onMONDAY.  23rd FEBRUARY,  at11 a.m.
