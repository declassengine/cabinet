(48) SO20th February, 1948.COPY NO.cabinet economic SygVSY FOR 1948Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and National service should like to circulate in advance of our discussion the following comments on the draft Economic Survey for 1948(CP, (48) 44).Textile Labour Target-2. While I am in general agreement with paragraph 204*  i must emphasise my view that the high target figure of 325,000 forcotton cannot be reached by the end of 1948.      The further measures to which brief mention is made in this paragraph will involve highly unpopular decisions.      But these decisions have notyet been&apos; taken and there is now rio prospect of hitting the targetby the end of the year.      I agree,  therefore, with the proposal madein the Chancellor&apos;s memorandum (CP. (48 ) 44) that the textilelabour target should be scaled down.Appendix I3- The discussion of manpower developments during 1947contained in paragraphs 12-17 of Appendix I is out of balance withthe rest of the Appendix and gives a misleading account of the redistribution of the labour force.      Nor does it take fully intoaccount the serious dislocation of production and consequentdistortion of the general pattern of employment caused by the fuelcrisis.      Manpower targets are only a means towards achievingproduction targets and the. success or otherwise of our generalmanpower policy should be measured by production levels and therelative absence of serious industrial strife.      If., the productiontargets are in fact reached with less manpower than laid down in the manpower targets, (as virtually happened in the case of the coal mining industry)  an important saving is effected in the use of manpowerwhich-should be a source of satisfaction rather than of criticism.I suggest,  therefore,  that the paragraphs in question should berecast on the lines of the attached draft. &apos;-G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1.20th February,  1948.
ANNEXSection to be substituted for paragraphs 12-17 of appendix I12. The &quot;Economic Survey for 1947&quot; set out a forecast of changes in the total manpower available for employment and a pattern for redistribution in accordance with the general economicand defence objectives set out in the Survey.      The table belowcompares the changes in manpower distribution set out in the survey for 1947 with those in fact realised.Man Power Changes;    End 1946 to End 1947ThousandsTotal Working PopulationStrength of ForcesEx-Service men and women notyet in employmentInsured UnemployedCivilian EmploymentCoal industryPublic utilitiesTransport and shippingAgriculture and FishingBuilding and Civil EngineeringManufacturing -Building materials andequipment j6Metals and engineering ftTextiles )Clothing )Food, drink and tobacco )Chemicals )Other manufacturing 0 )Total manufacturingDistribution )Consumers&apos; services )Public service -National Government )N.F.S.  and Police )Local Government )As estimated inSurvey of 1947 K-1774-224-29+70h-39+18+S44-374-244-24+154-75+1604-55-80Actual-t-9-257	-327-200	-1774-2	-984-278	4-61 1+40	4-284-17	4-6-3	4-544-39	4-9+ 50	4-754-2474-42136-414-24-534-278+611The figures for end 1947 used in the table above arenot exactly identical with those -used in Table XXIowing to differences in the grouping of industriesbetween the Survey for 1947 and the present Survey.s   Based on Table A of &quot;Economic Survey for 1947&quot;&apos;-1-
13* When the Economic Survey for 1947 was written,  it was expected that the total working population would fallsubstantially during the year.      In the event the working population on balance changed little;    it fell steadily inthe first nine months of the year but the campaign to bringadditional women into the industry,  together with the Controlof Engagement Order in October,  resulted in a considerablerecovery during the autumn.      The Survey for 1947 stressed theneed for measures to bring into industry 100,000 more workersthan seemed likely to be available.      The sources suggestedwere foreign workers,  additional women workers,  and postponement of retirement.      These measures had considerable success;    thenumber of foreign workers placed during 1947 was alone about95,000.14* As a result of the stability in the numbers of theworking population, together with on acceleration of releaseof men from the Forces and a fall in unemployment,  the numbers in civilian employment of all kinds increased by 3.*3 per cent,instead of the expected 1.5 per cent.      The  principal undermannedindustries - coalmining,  agriculture and textiles - expanded,however,  less than had been hoped.      In coalmining the expansion in the first part of the year was rapid enough to meet the targetif the rate of increase could have been maintained;    the shortfallwas due to the disappointing trend of the labour force later inthe year.      In spite of the shortfall,  the output came close tothe target as a result of increasing productivity.      manufacturing industries other than textiles increased substantially more than was estimated (with the exception of the building materialsgrou p). /&apos;15. The expansion of distribution and consumer serviceswas greater than the rough estimate made in the Survey, thelargest expansion being in the consumer services.      Publicservice also showed a small net expansion instead of the expected decline,  the increase being confined to local government service while numbers in national government employment were reduced.      The excess in transport was due principally to theincrease in road passenger transport.
