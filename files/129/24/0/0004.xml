The bulk of the White Paper consists of explanationsand statistics related to the Defence Estimates for 191+8/1+9,which were approved by the Cabinet on 6th January (CM. (1+8) 1stConclusions, Minute 1).      In addition, however, there is afinal section (paragraphs 51 - 62) of the White Paper dealingwith the future.      As my colleagues are aware, much attention has been devoted during the past 12 months to the problems connected with the production of a co-ordinated long-termdefence plan.     A good deal of progress has been made, but wehave not yet reached a stage at which firm proposals can besubmitted for the approval of the Cabinet.     The DefenceCommittee,  after full discussion at two meetings held at thebeginning of January, invited me, in consultation with theService Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, to work out, on thebasis of certain general decisions recorded by the Committee,co-ordinated long-term plans for the Armed Forces and to submitthese plans in due course to the Committee.3. In these circumstances, the paragraphs in the white paper which deal with the future have been drafted in very tgeneral terras.      I would, however, draw the particular attentionof the Cabinet to paragraph 61 on the subject of National Service.U-. I invite the Cabinet to approve the White Paper,subject to any minor drafting alterations which may still befound to be necessary.      It is at present intended that publication should take place on 19th February and that thegeneral Debate on Defence should be held in the House ofCommons during the first week of March.A.V.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.2nd February, 19U8.
Statement Relating to defence, 1948
Statement Relating to Defence, 19481. This Statement, the second to be, issued since the establishment ofthe Ministry of Defence, has been prepared under three main headings: (i) Requirements in 1948-49;(ii) Developments in defence organisation;(in) The future;prefaced by a brief sumrnary of major developments since the publicationof the last Statement (Cmd.-7042).Developments since the publication of the last Statement - ^2.   In Cmd. 7042 it was estimated that by the end of the current finance.&apos;year the strength of the Forces would be reduced to 1,087,000.   Last Autumn,after a full review, it was decided that further large reductions should bemade, the effect of which will be to bring the total strength of the Forcesdown to 940,000* by 31st March, 1948.3. In July last, the National Service Act, 1947, received the royal assent. This Act, which comes into full effect on 1st January, 1949, continuesfor a further period the principle of universal military service. Men called up from 1st January, 1949, onwards will do one year&apos;s full time service, andon release will thereafter be transferred to the Reserves or Auxiliary forces for six years, with a liability for part time training-4. On I9th December, 1947, the Prime Minister announced in the Houseof Commons the outline of a new civil defence organisation, which will consistin part of military mobile columns trained in civil defence duties. Thesecolumns will provide a reserve for reinforcement of local services where necessary. , *-5. Constitutional changes within the British Commonwealth and Empire,the departure of Burma from the Commonwealth, and the decision to withdraw from Palestine, have profoundly affected the dispositions of our forces.6. On the transfer of power in India, and the creation of the two newDominions of India and Pakistan, it was announced that all United kingdom forces would be withdrawn. This process has continued smoothly, and willhave been completed by the end of February. Assistance is being givento the two new Dominions in the establishment of their own defence forces,and it is hoped that in due course discussions will take place with them onall defence questions of mutual interest.7. On 4th February, 1948, Ceylon attained fully responsible statuswithin the British Commonwealth of Nations. A Defence Agreement governingrelations between Ceylon and the United Kingdom after the change of statuswas concluded on 11th November, 1947; the text was published in Cmd. 7257.8. Since the departure of Burma from the British Commonwealth, her relations with the United Kingdom in defence matters have been governed by the Defence Agreement concluded in August 1947, and published in cmd. 7240. The withdrawal of United Kingdom -forces will be completed during March, but, in accordance with the terms of the Defence Agreement,a British Services Mission was established in Burma on 4th January, 1948,the date of the transfer of power.9. Commitments in Europe have not been liquidated as rapidly as hadbeen expected when Cmd. 7042 was issued, and United. Kingdom Forces* Previously announced as 937,000. This figure has been adjusted to include allService boys and nurses and to exclude locally enlisted personnel who do not constitute a call on United Kingdom man-power.
are still stationed in Greece, Austria, and Trieste. In the Far East, however,the United Kingdom component of the British Commonwealth OccupationForce in Japan has been almost wholly withdrawn.REQUIREMENTS IN 1948-49(I) Man-powerUniformed Man-power10.   The uniformed strength of the Forces will fall from 1,427,000 on1st January, 1947, to 940,000 on 31st March, 1948. The total fall in numbersduring the fifteen months will thus be 487,000. This figure represents thes\Jbt reduction in strengths after balancing intake against releases; the actualreleases in the period will be about 890,000.11. The present assessment is that by the end of the financial year1948-49, the strength of the Forces will have fallen to 716,000. The followingtable shows the expected division of numbers between the three services at the beginning and end of the financial year.1st April, 1948 31si March, 1949Royal Navy         ...            145,000 145,000Army ...... 534,000 345,000Royal Air Force   ... 261,000 226,00012. The bulk of the reduction will fall upon the Army. It was foundpreferable to bring the Navy down as rapidly as possible during the current financial year, and to accept a temporary measure of disorganisation andimmobility. No further reduction is planned during 1948-49. There willbe a further fall in the strength of the Royal Air Force, but the rate of rundownwill be appreciably slower than hitherto.13. Before the end of 1948, all National Servicemen who had been called up before the end of 1946 will be released, and in the first quarter of 1949 a start will be made with the release of men covered by the arrangements setout in the White Paper on Call-up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948 (Cmd. 6831).From the middle of the calendar year 1949, the period of service of thesemen will begin to taper off rapidly from the full period of two years, and men called up in December 1948, will serve for one year only.14. The continued rapid loss of National Servicemen with longer training and experience, and their replacement by men whose period of full time service is continually decreasing, creates a state of unbalance in all three services. This makes more difficult the tasks of carrying out current com-commitments and of training the new intake. It is essential that the RegularServices should be built up as rapidly as possible to the size needed to meetsuch of the overseas commitments as must be fulfilled by Regulars, and toprovide experienced instructors for training the National Service intake.It is, therefore, intended that the campaign to encourage voluntary recruitingto the Regular Forces should continue and the highest importance is attachedto its success. At the same time it has been found necessary to restrict the intake of National Service men, and the call-up in 1948 will accordingly beretarded; it has already been announced that the registration which wouldhave normally taken place in March will be postponed till June. The effectof this will be to reduce to 150,000 the intake of National Service men intothe Forces during the financial year 1948-49. This intake will be divided between the three Services as follows: Royal Navy.............. 2,000Army   ................. 100,000Royal Air Force         ......      ... 48,00034836                                    - B 2
15. During the current year, recruiting for the auxiliary forces of thethree Services has been reopened, but progress to date has been disappointing.It is upon these volunteers, supplementing the small cadre of Regularinstructors, that the duty of training the National Service intake during their period of service in the [Reserves or Auxiliary Forces will largely fallfrom 1st January, 1950, and every encouragement must be given to thosewho are willing to undertake this important national duty. There are many difficulties in the way, particularly as regards the provision of suitable accommodation, but all practicable steps will be taken to overcome them.Civilian Man-power16. In Cmd. 7042, no reference was made to the calls of defence on tb \civilian man-power of the United Kingdom, with the exception of productionand research and development, for which a figure of 450,000 was given asthe requirement during the current financial year. For the financial year1948-49 and thereafter the relevant civilian numbers will be shown in theDefence White Paper.17.   The work of these civilians falls into three main categories: (a) Administrative, clerical, technical and supervising duties;(b) Miscellaneous duties in Service Establishments, including storekeepingand transport;(c) Production, research and development, and works.In the first two categories, the man-power consists in the main of direct government employees; in the third, it is principally contract labour, though a proportion is directly employed.18. Excluding the industrial staffs under (c) above, it is expected thatthe total numbers of civilians directly employed on defence work on 1st April,1948, and 31st March, 1949, will be respectively 242,000 and 227,000. Asregards (c), the average number engaged on work for the Services duringthe financial year is estimated to be approximately 350,000 except for thenon-industrial staff who are shown under the other headings. The detailed figures are contained in Annex 1.19. Though the reductions in the. numbers of civilians engaged on workfor the Services during 1947-48 and foreshadowed for 1948-49 are substantial,they are not in any way. proportionate to the fall in the uniformed strengthof the Armed Forces. This is only natural; during the war years uniformedman-power increased proportionately far more than did the civilian man-poweremployed by the Services. A large part of the work in connection with therelease of uniformed man-power falls upon civilians, who perform such duties as settlement of pay accounts, payment of terminal benefits, and the like.Moreover, the reduction in uniformed strength at establishments such asstores depots, motor transport maintenance establishments, and workshopshas been so great that it has been found necessary in some cases to recruitadditional civilians to prevent a breakdown in organisation.(II) Finance-20.   The net financial provision for defence proposed for 1948-49, isshown in the following table:  j-MillionRoyal NavyArmyRoyal Air ForceMinistry of supply ministry of Defence153305173610-6Total   ......-    ......      692-6
21. For the first time the expenditure of the Ministry of Defence is includedin the Defence Budget. The increase of rather more than  200,000 over theMinistry&apos;s Estimate for 1947-48 is almost entirely due to transfer of expenditure from Service Votes; at the beginning of the financial year the Ministry ofDefence will assume full financial responsibility for the Headquarters staffs of the Imperial Defence College, the Joint Services Staff College, and combined operations Headquarters.22. The Defence Budget for 1948-49 excludes all expenditure on research and development for civil aviation and atomic energy, which was includedin the financial provision for the Ministry of Supply shown in last year&apos;white Paper. The total of  692 - 6 million does, however, still include^Sibstantial expenditure on non-military activities such as the Polish Resettle-ment Corps, the administration and control of prisoners of war, and the civil government of certain occupied territories. The cost of these activities isestimated to be nearly  11 million, mainly carried on Army Votes.23. The method of assessing the proportion of the total expenditureof the Ministry of Supply which is properly attributable to defence has been reviewed during the year. As already stated, expenditure on research intoatomic energy has been excluded, together with the estimated share of research and development work attributable to civil aviation. The cost of all service personnel serving at the headquarters of the Ministry of Supply or at out-stations and of a percentage of its directly employed civilian staff has thisyear been included in the total.  8 million has also been included on accountof production for the Services, the cost of which will not be recoverable duringthe financial year. The new basis of assessment is considered to be muchmore accurate than the rather rough and ready methods which had to beused last year.24. Of the total of  692 - 6 million,  60 - 5 million, as against  118-5 million in 1947-48, is required to meet terminal charges for release leave and clothingtermination of contracts, and works and lands charges such as compensationfor land requisitioned.&apos; The cost of the Polish Resettlement Corps and of thecontrol and administration of prisoners of war has also been treated as aterminal charge. One of the main reasons for the continued high rate ofexpenditure on terminal charges is the accelerated payment of release benefitsdue to the rapid rundown in uniformed strength during the year. Thisaccounts for more than  22 million. More than  25 million is required for works and lands charges and payments on termination of war contracts.25. In last year&apos;s White Paper the expenditure of the Service Departmentswas divided under the following main headings: (a) Personnel;(b) Production;(c) Works;-(d) Non-effective;(e) Miscellaneous.This year, a more elaborate division has been prepared under suitable headings,and including the expenditure of the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry ofDefence.   This is given in Annex II.26. It is estimated that during the financial year net military expenditure overseas will amount to approximately  75 million. This includes the costof all imported oil wherever consumed, but excludes the cost of food obtained through the United Kingdom import programme. Expenditure on worksoverseas accounts for nearly  16 million. As a contribution to the reduction of overseas expenditure, the consumption of petroleum products by the Services
has been curtailed, and Service rations have been adjusted in order to reduceconsumption of foods obtained from dollar, sources of supply. A large partof the total of local expenditure overseas will be incurred in the sterling area.27. The pay, food, and clothing of the men and women in the Forces,together with the pensions and gratuities of ex-regulars account for some 238 million, or almost 35 per cent, of the total Defence Budget.28. The Service Estimates for 1948-49 have been prepared on theassumption that no unforeseen requirements are likely to arise during theyear and that present expectations as to the reduction of overseas commitmentswill be justified. By March 1949, it is expected that, apart from the normal peace-time responsibilities of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, ther &quot;will be limited to our share of the occupation of Germany, the requirements bxthe Middle East and Far East, and the small garrisons needed at a variety of overseas stations. Should these expectations be falsified in the event, it maybe necessary to ask Parliament to make supplementary provision for theServices before the end of the financial year.(Ill) Production29. The fjiel crisis of February 1947, and difficulties experiencedthroughout the year in supply of labour and materials for the production of equipment for the Services, have caused severe dislocation&apos; of the 1947-48production programmes, and there will be large under-spendings on this account by the Service Departments. During the year the labour forceengaged on production for the Services is estimated to have fallen by 100,000.30. The need to restore the economic position of the United Kingdom hasimposed even greater limitations upon the production of equipment and stores for the Services in 1948-49 than it did in 1947-48. It has been possibleto provide for little more than the minimum requirements of maintenance,though re-equipment in certain important fields, particularly in respect of aircraft for the Koyal Air Force and the Naval Air Arm; will be continued at a somewhat reduced rate. Stocks remaining from the war will continue to beused to the limit. In order to free the industry for manufacture for export, ithas been decided to continue the policy of placing no orders for new vehicles,with certain minor exceptions. The vehicles remaining from the war are nowgetting old, and the cost, of maintaining them in efficient operation is rapidlyrising; the provision in Army Votes on this account alone amounts to some 13&apos; million.31. The basis of the Naval production programmes for 1948-49 is themaintenance and repair of the active Fleet expected to be in commissionduring the year. A start will be made with some minor measures of modernisa-tion in certain important units of the Fleet, and repair and maintenance ofvessels in reserve will be continued.. Work will also be continued on ships under construction, though at a slower pace, and the re-equipment of theNaval Air Arm with newer British types of aircraft, which was begun in1947-48, will be carried further during the year. A limited number ofexperimental types of aircraft will be prodnced.32. The production programme for the Army is again principally made up of items required for essential maintenance. Production of the latesttype of armoured fighting vehicle will be continued, but at a very reduced rate. Some new production will be necessary for troop trials and for theessential training of National Servicemen.33. The Air Ministry programme provides for a further measure of re-armament of Fighter Squadrons with jet-propelled aircraft and for alimited measure of re-equipment in other fields.
34. As a contribution to national recovery, Service requirements forconsumer goods which are in short supply in the civilian market have been severely restricted, and machinery has been created for examining demands forsuch items. The continuing supply difficulties will make it necessary toapply the same restrictions in 1948-49, and improvements in the living conditions of the Services will unfortunately be severely limited for thisreason.35. During the past year, further progress has been made with plans for standardising between the Services the widest possible range of equipment and stores. It is hoped that the eventual result will be considerable economy-in demands on industry, and to increase efficiency in the distribution of equipment and stores to the Services.36. In the preparation of the Production Programmes for 1948-49, theneed to maintain a healthy war potential has been kept in mind. Undercurrent conditions direct production for defence must necessarily be restricted.Fortunately, however, those basic industries of the country on which war potential ultimately depends are in a healthy and flourishing state, thoughdifficulties are likely to be experienced in certain highly specialised fields.(IV) Research and Development37. The research and development estimates of the Admiralty and ministry of Supply have been examined by the Defence Research PolicyCommittee, which was constituted under the Chairmanship of Sir HenryTizard on 1st January, 1947, and has been in full activity throughout the year.38. Research and development continues to receive the highest priority in the defence field, both in the allocation of man-power and materials and inthe provision of finance. Difficulties are, however, being experienced owingto the general shortage of qualified scientific and technical staff and troublesover the supply of labour and materials have had an adverse effect on certain important new works projects.39. During the year the Defence Research Policy Committee has devotedconsiderable attention to the establishment of priorities within the field of research and development, with the object of concentrating work on a smaller number of items of the highest importance. This will mean slowing down orabandoning work on projects which are of less importance.40. A high proportion of the total expenditure on defence research anddevelopment is devoted to general aeronautical research and to the developmentof aircraft with improved characteristics of speed, range and carrying powers.The problems of high speed flight are receiving much attention, and the policyis to study them not only by means of wind tunnel experiments, but also byflight trials of research aircraft, both piloted and pilotless. There can be little doubt that it will eventually be possible to produce operationally effectivemilitary aircraft capable of flying above the speed of sound. Work continuesalso on the development of aero-engines mainly in the form of gas turbines,in which field this country has long held a leading place. aeronautical research and development has, of course, a great value for civil as well as formilitary purposes.41. Intimately connected with work on aeronautics is the effort being put into the development of controlled missiles of various kinds.- One of themain objects of this work is to provide the most effective possible defence against aircraft attack. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australiais co-operating fully in this work by establishing a range and an organisation in Australia; where it will be possible to carry out full-scale tests under mostsuitable conditions.
(V) Works42. In order to assist in the reduction of capital investment, it has been necessary to restrict expenditure on works projects- in the United kingdom to the minimum for the time being. The labour ceilings which have been fixed for the Service Departments have been published in the White paper on Capital Investment in 1948 (Cmd. 7268). Machinery exists to ensurethat the labour allocated to the Services is properly distributed between them.43.   Difficulties in connection with the balance of payments have caused a curtailment of overseas works programmes.   The decision to withdraw from palestine, and the general process of redeployment in the Middle East whichthis entails, will, however, create new liabilities.   Work has already begun-on the building of a new storeholding area for the Army in Kenya. v44. It is intended to continue the building of married quarters for theServices both at home and abroad during the year, but the amount whichcan be achieved in the immediate future will unfortunately be severely limited by difficulties of supply and by the need to curtail overseas expenditure.These considerations will also affect the improvement of amenities and living conditions, but it remains the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto raise Service standards as soon as practicable. The economies which arebeing made will result in increased expenditure when the supply and financial situation improves.DEVELOPMENTS IN DEFENCE ORGANISATION45. During 1947 the Central Organisation for Defence, which was explained in the White Paper of that name (Cmd. 6923), has had its first fullscale test. Its main tasks can be summarised as (a) the general planning of Defence policy and the production of a properly co-ordinated long-termDefence, plan; (b) the allocation of available resources of money and man-power; and (c) the achievement of the necessary degree of co-ordination in the administrative sphere. The succeeding section of this Paper dealswith the future; the proposed allocation of resources for 1948-49 has alreadybeen described. This section deals briefly with administrative co-ordination and with arrangements for maintaining contact between members of theCommonwealth.46. Irfthis sphere the Ministry of Defence has made full use of the inter-Service machinery which existed before its establishment as well as of the new arrangements for co-ordination at the Ministerial and official levels providedfor by the White Paper on Central Organisation for Defence (Cmd. 6923).47. The White Paper on Central Organisation for Defence (Cmd. 6923)referred to the possibility of amalgamating the common administrative services of the Armed Forces. Further examination has not led His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the conclusion that such a complete amalgamation would be inthe real interests of economy and efficiency, either in existing circumstancesor in those which are likely to obtain for many years to come. In the view ofthe Government a more satisfactory alternative is the closest possible measureof co-ordination without actual amalgamation. This is the policy which they intend to pursue. Accordingly, co-ordinating committees are now being established for the medical, educational, and chaplaincy services. these committees will be fitted into the organisation of the Ministry. of Defence,and the Ministry will provide the Chairman and secretariat. The reportsof the committees will be considered by the Minister of Defence and the service ministers. It is hoped that this strengthening of the central machinery will serve to overcome some of the defects in the working of similar committees which existed between the two wars.
48. Apart .from these special committees, the Ministry of Defence isparticipating to an increasing extent in the moulding of common policyover the whole field of Service administration. While this object is being achieved in certain cases by the participation of the Ministry of defence in the work of existing bodies or committees, new machinery wiH be createdwherever it is found to be necessary. By the development to the full of theMinistry&apos;s function of co-ordination, it is hoped to secure common treatmentof common problems in the Services.49. During the year, further improvements have taken place in theorganisation within the Commonwealth for the exchange of information&quot;in defence questions and for the common study of problems of mutual concern.United Kingdom Service Liaison Staffs have now been set up in Canada,the Union of South Africa, and in Australia, and will shortly be established in New Zealand. The establishment of British Service Staffs in the Dominions,and of Dominion Staffs in the United Kingdom, provides a system through which a standard of co-operation can be achieved which will measure up to theneeds of modern defence strategy. It is hoped that it will before long bepossible to have defence discussions with the new Dominions of India and pakistan, and in the meantime Service representatives have been attachedto the staffs of the United Kingdom High Commissioners. Mention hasalready been made of the change in the status of Ceylon and of the defence agreement which has been concluded between the Governments of ceylon and the United Kingdom.50. During the month of November 1947, the Commonwealth AdvisoryCommittee on Defence Science, which is composed of senior officers of theServices and of representative scientists from the United Kingdom and theDominions, held a series of meetings in London. The discussions covereda very wide field, and valuable results were achieved. It is intended thatmeetings of the Committee shall be held at regular intervals in the several countries of the Commonwealth, and these will foster the growing understanding between them of the problems of defence science.THE FUTURE51. The fulfilment of the main object of the United Nations themaintenance of world peace depends on the ability and readiness of theGreat Powers to keep the peace. The United Kingdom, as a member of theBritish Commonwealth and a Great Power, must be prepared at all times to fulfil her responsibility not only to the United Nations but also to herself.For this purpose, the first essential is a strong and sound economy, with aflourishing industry from which to draw the strength to defend our rightsand fulfil our obligations.52. Wars occur either by. the pursuit of a deliberate policy of force,or by a miscalculation of the lengths to which a policy can be pursued withoutprovoking war. The supreme object of British policy must continue to bethe prevention of war. In the present situation where the United nations organisation is not yet able to enforce peace, the best deterrent towar is tangible evidence of our intention and ability to withstand attack.Whether it is a question of self-defence or of support of the United Nations,it is necessary to maintain British forces in peace-time to deter aggressionwhich might lead to war.53. Defence policy is conditioned by the balance and inter-relationship of factors such as the economic position of the country/ international and national obligations, the lessons of the last war, in particular the influence of new weapons, and an estimate of the form of a future war should it come.
The conclusions reached now on any single factor may be nullified, amendedor confirmed in the future as further study reveals the lessons of experience and research.   Our policy must therefore be kept flexible.54. New scientific developments do not modify the basic principles ofdefence policy, but the advent of weapons of mass destruction must profoundlyinfluence both the preparations for and the conduct of war. Though it isnot yet possible to assess with any accuracy what their effect on strategywill be, it can be said provisionally that their existence increases the possibility-facilities of surprise attack, since the effort required to deliver devastating attackswith these weapons will be smaller than that which would be demanded bythe use of conventional weapons, and that decisive results might even b &quot;obtained by their use alone. The acceptable standards of defence are thereforebound to be raised, including that of the system of civil defence for the civilian population, on whose productive efforts the successful conduct ofmilitary operations so largely depends.55. The influence of this single &quot;new weapon&quot; factor and its capability of development is an emphatic reminder of the needs to preserve a flexiblepolicy and a warning that there must be no rigidity in decisions about thefuture role of the three Services.56. The potentialities of these new weapons also enhance the need for greater co-operation within the Commonwealth. The security of the UnitedKingdom is one of the keystones of Commonwealth defence, but, equally,the United Kingdom alone, without the support of the Commonwealth, would lose much of its effective influence and power. If war should ever be forced upon us, besides defending these islands, we should have to play our partin defending the resources on which the Commonwealth must rely. Thecontrol of communications and of strategic key-points is essential to the achievement of this aim.57. With these considerations in mind, His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to maintain balanced forces adequate to fulfil their responsibiltiesin peace and to serve as a nucleus of expansion in war. To this end, theyare engaged in the production of a co-ordinated long-term defence planwithin a general but flexible policy on the shape and size of the forces.58. The share of the national resources which can be made availablefor defence will inevitably be limited for some time to come by the need to restore the general economy of the country, on which everything else depends.In these circumstances, it will clearly be necessary to pursue a severely selectivepolicy in order to concentrate our defence effort on essentials. That mustbe the key note of our forward planning, even while we continue to take intoaccount the exceptional commitments which the Army in particular still have to meet.59. In the application of that general aim, research and development for all three Services must remain in the forefront. To avoid wastefuldispersion of effort, activity must be directed as far as possible to thoseprojects which in the long run are expected to have the greatest effect uponthe future conduct of war. This is continuously the aim of the forward planning undertaken by the Defence Research Policy Committee.60. To assist the examination of the effect upon the three Services ofthis concentration upon essentials, the Government have given the followingguidance. The Royal Air Force must be maintained at a level sufficientto preserve its essential structure and its initial striking power. The royal navy, with its air arm, must be enabled to perform its vital role in the controlof sea communications and to execute such tasks overseas as are laid upon it.The Army must be in a position to meet its overseas commitments and to
34836provide the organisation needed for training its National Service intake. Inthis process of selection and concentration, the varying length of time whichwould be required by each Service in order to re-equip it to full efficiencyat the outbreak of war must be given due weight.61. So far as it is possible to see ahead in present circumstances, KisMajesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that it will be necessary to maintain theprinciple of universal military service and the provisions of the NationalService Act, 1947. There is no possibility that the Army or the Royal AirForce will be able to meet their commitments without supplementing theirregular strength by National Servicemen, and the need for a trained reserve for all three Services capable of immediate mobilisation in emergency remainsk basic requirement of this country&apos;s defence. The form of National service for the next: few years must remain as laid down in the Act of 1947, but after a detailed examination, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusionthat for 1949 and 1950 at least, as well as for 1948, the intake of national servicemen should be limited to a maximum of 150,000. This limitationof numbers will be achieved by the means which are to be adopted in 1948,i.e., by the omission of one registration in each year, which has the effect of raising the age of call-up by three months. Under this scheme, the age ofcall-up in 1950 will have been raised to eighteen years and nine months.62. The objectives of our defence policy derive directly from our obligations and commitments as a Great Power. It remains the firm intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to maintain the forces which are needed to supportits international policy, to ensure the security of the United Kingdom, tomaintain its interests throughout the world, and to enable it to play its full part in the preservation of world peace. The forces which we maintain inpeace must be sufficient to provide an adequate nucleus for expansion inwar, to meet the need for garrisons overseas, including those engaged onoccupational duties, and to furnish our contribution, when needed, to theUnited Nations Armed Forces. All these duties are the inescapable respon-sibilities of a great Power intent on preserving peace.
