1	j-flKUIUYHIJ..........fij^	/MIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP	HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government)SECRET	COPY NO.  ?0CP. (08) 00	kth February, 19U-8.	cabinet palestine:_WITHDRAWAL OF BRITISH ADMINISTRATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the United Nations Commission have been informed, andit has been publicly announced, that it is our intention to terminate British civil administration in Palestine on15th May,  191+8.      The possibility of advancing this date was recently re-examined by me in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence, andwe reached the conclusion that the repercussions on the militaryplan of selecting an earlier date could not be accepted.2. British civil administration is still being maintained over the whole of Palestine,  and it is not theintention to close down any Department before the terminationof the Mandate.      In the present disturbed conditions, however,the range and effectiveness of certain departmental functionsare necessarily restricted and difficulty is being encounteredthrough the reluctance of Jewish and Arab staff to report for duty through fear of molestation bjr members of the othercommunity.      This latter tendency has been most noticeable inJerusalem, although in the last tv/o weeks improvement in theattendances of local staff has been continuous.3. Although full responsibility is retained by theMandatory Government,  steps are being taken to devolve certainfunctions of government on the local inhabitants.      Palestiniansare being appointed to perform the duties of Britishadministrative officers as the latter proceed on leave.Legislation is being prepared to give local authorities wider powers, e.g., of taxation,  and certain essential public utilities are being handed over to them.      In the field ofpublic security local arrangements are also being made.      Britishpolice have been withdrawn from the Tel-Aviv area and, exceptfor divisional headquarters, from Nablus, Heb*ron, Jericho, andcertain isolated police posts in northern Palestine.      In theformer area responsibility for internal security has been handed over to 0 Jewish Guard Force maintained by the jewish agency and in the latter districts responsibility is carried by the Arabs of the Palestine Police Force under British command.In these Arab areas the local police have been reinforced bysome British troops for general security.      An Arab Municipalpolice force has been set up in Jaffa and arrangements are inhand for establishing similar forces in 18 other Arab towns.By the end of February&apos;it is hoped to have formed in Jerusalema Municipal police force of 600,  half Jew and Half Arab.     Acountrywide scheme for the enrolment of armed special constablesto police Arab villages has been started.      All these forcesremain under the direction of the Inspector-General of police and will only pass fully to local control on the termination ofthe Mandate.
IT) F-3iff4. The evacuation of British officials and their families has begun.      Since 1st February, 51  British officials,and 12 wives and 5 children of British officials have leftPalestine.      370 berths have been reserved for British officersof the Administration and their families for February and during March and April 200 will sail every fortnight from Haifa.The balance of dOO will leave Palestine in smaller contingentsby vessels carrying the orange crop and by air.      It isintended that all British wives and children of officials shallbe out of the country one month before the termination of theMandate.5* The commercial activity of the country has been severely restricted.      Labour difficulties have been encountered where Arabs and Jews normally work together andthere is consequently some congestion in Haifa and Jaffa ports.The citrus export programme is somewhat behind schedule butprospects of completion are fair if the present rate ismaintained.      The export of citrus is not impeding the plannedmilitary withdrawal.      Railways continue to operate butVoadtransport is -considerably restricted.      Difficulty is being experienced through the shortage of oil fuel due to thetemporary stoppage at the Haifa refineries.      Work there was resumed on a small scale on 22nd January and if there are nofurther set-bocks full production should be attained within three weeks.6. There is a noticeable decline in the collection ofrevenue.      As the assessment of the terminal liabilities ofthe Palestine Government proceeds, it is becoming evident thatits available balances will not suffice to meet all commitments.A deficit of at least  4,000,000 is expected.      This can be attributed mainly to heavy expense involved in meeting the costs of the Cyprus camps and in payment of terminal benefits toGovernment servants.7. Units of the Transjordan Arab Legion in Palestine,who are to be returned to Transjordan before the termination ofthe civil government, ore employed in static guard and escortduty and not in dealing with communal disorders.      disarmament and disbandraent of the Transjordan Frontier Force has now begunat its base at Zerka in Transjordan.      TransJordanians andSyrians will be discharged there and will not enter Palestine.Egyptians and Palestinians will be discharged at Samakh inPalestine.      It is intended to repatriate to their countries of origin all those members of the Force who are not Palestinians,8. Prospects of improvement in the security situationare not good.      Conflict in Jerusalem has subsided and thereis some hope that the situation there will not deteriorateunless some serious act of provocation is committed by one ofthe communities.      The general situation is much complicated by the recent entry from neighbouring Arab States of largebands of trained guerillas.     A force of some 300 from Syriahas established itself in the hills of Galilee and a secondlarge band of some 700 has entered Samaria via Transjordan.This latter band is now reported to have been reinforced by a contingent of some 900 which has also entered via Transjordan.Arab governments appear both powerless and unwilling to restrict the movements of these armed bands and the nature of the
[Palestine land frontiers, together with the other commitments of the security forces, makes it impossible for the Palestine[Government to be certain of denying entry to such bands.      Thepresent policy of the invaders is to disperse amongst the[villages on their arrival and consequently they do not presenta formed body which can be driven out by our forces.      should major engagement occur between the security forces and thesearmed bands within Palestine the consequences are bound to begrave.A. C o J.polonial Office,  S.W.1.U/th February,  19U8.
