slRCULATED779:g DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)PALESTINE:    ATTITUDE OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS PLANMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will wish to &quot;be reminded of the statements which hove been made on behalf of His Mojesty&apos;sGovernment with regard to the part they are prepared to play inthe implementation of the United Nations Plan.2. At the Special Session of the United Nations general assembly in April,  191+7* at which the Special Committee on palestine was set up, Sir Alexander Cadogan stated that, if theUnited Nations could find a just solution acceptable to both parties, it would be welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government butthey should not&apos;have the sole responsibility for enforcing asolution which was not accepted by both parties and which we couldnot reconcile with our conscience.3. In the opening stages of the discussion of the SpecialCommittee&apos;s report by the General Assembly, on 26th September,191+7* and 16th October,  191+7, I made two speeches outlining theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the report.      I made it clear that they would be in the highest degree reluctant to oppose the wishes of the General Assembly with regard to thefuture of Palestine but they were not prepared to impose by force of arms a settlement which was not acceptable to both theArabs and the Jews in Palestine.      In the absence of such asettlement His Majesty&apos;s Government must plan for the earlywithdrawal of British forces and administration from Palestine.I pointed out that it would be unreasonable to ask His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to carry sole responsibility for the administrationof Palestine and for enforcing changes which the United Nationsregarded as necessary.      In determining the nature of thesettlement the Assembly should also determine the measures to implement it.      His Majesty&apos;s Government would not accept responsibility for enforcement of a disputed settlement, eitheralone or in the major role.     Likewise in considering anyproposal to the effect that they should participate with others inthe enforcement of a settlement, they must take into accountboth the inherent justice of the settlement and the extent towhich force would be required to give effect to it.k* As discussion in Committee and Sub-Committee continuedit was necessary for our representatives on several occasions toelaborate and stress the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government toenforcement.     We stated that our authorities had been directed to plan for the evacuation of our forces and administration toS E C R E TCOPYCP. (48) 1+11+th February,_19U8.CABINET
be completed by 1st August,  1948, and thct a civil administration would not necessarily be maintained up to that date.     Wereserved the right to lay down the Mandate and to bring the civil administration to an end at any time.after it had become evidentthat no settlement acceptable to both Jews and Arabs had beenreached by the Assembly.      Sir Alexander Gadogan stated on13th November that:    &quot;...  if 0 United Notions Commission were at work in Palestine taking preparatory steps for a settlement which would require enforcement it must not expect british authorities either to exercise administrative responsibility orto maintain law and order except in the limited areas of whichthey would necessarily remain in. occupation during the process of withdrawl.115. On 20th November Sir Alexander Cadogan expressed thehope that in drawing up its proposals the Assembly would take full account of the risk of strife in Palestine and of the need toprovide a means of filling the gap in the process of enforcementleft by the decision of the Mandatory Power that its troops couldnot be used as the instrument of the United Nations for thispurpose.      In arranging our withdrawal we would give properconsideration to such arrangements as might have been made by theUnited Nations for the establishment of a provisional regime to succeed the Mandate, but the present Government would relinquishits authority only to a United Notions Commission which could thenundertake to devolve that authority to successor governments asit thought fit.      So long as His Majesty&apos;s Government continued tohold the Mandate, they must insist on their undivided control ofthe country.6. In the light of our representatives&apos;&apos; statements certain modifications were made to the Plan which failed however toprovide any alternative means of enforcement to the employment ofthe forces of the Mandatory Power.      It was necessary for our representatives to re-emphasize that the gap in enforcement still remained and that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not consider thatthe Mandate required them to establish either 0 Jewish State or an arab State in Palestine by force, or to coerce either people inthe interest of the other, nor were they prepared to accept any responsibility under the Assembly recommendations which wouldinvolve the use of British troops as the means for enforcing adecision against either people.7. In opening the debate in the House of Commons on11th December,  1947,  I recalled the statements made on the problemof enforcement by our delegation to the United Notions, and statedthat it was not for Britain, after it had given so much, to take up again the heavy commitments of bringing a new order fashionedby the United Nations into being in the face of new conflict.I stated that the date we had in mind for the termination of theMandate was 15th May,  1948,  and that in our view undivided controlof Palestine was essential until the Mandate was relinquished.As His Majesty&apos;s Government had made it clear that they could not take part in the implementation of the United Nations Plan itwould be undesirable for the Commission to arrive in Palestineuntil a short period before the termination of the Mandate.8. In the same debate the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs made the following statement:    &quot;I am not going, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government are not going, to oppose the United Nationsdecision.      The decision has been taken.      As someone has said v/ehave tried our best.      We have no intention of opposing thatdecision, but we cannot ourselves undertake,  either individuallyor collectively in association with others, to impose that
, decision by force.&quot;      In reply to a question regarding our action if the. Security Council were to decide that collective enforcementI was necessary in respect of Palestine, he said:      &quot;It is for therSecurity Council to lay down itself how they will find the forces,fj and the form of the forces, but I cannot use British organisedJl forces nor can I be a party at the present moment, with securityJforces as a whole not yet organised in the United Nations, of;j putting British forces under other commands.     When the schemeI is finally worked out of what this United Nations force is to be,j what its command is to be,  and what its obligations are to be,II not only in Palestine but as part of the international set-up,ij then we will take our corner, but to put British forces under another command in this way in an isolated instance is a thingi we are not prepared to do.&quot;: 9. &quot;;-The latest occasion on which His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentsI attitude on this matter was re-stated was in the debate in theI House of Lords on 20th January when the Minister of State forI the Colonies &apos; said:      &quot;The House will remember that His Majesty&apos;sI Government have made it abundantly clear again and again that[ they cannot allow our forces to be employed in imposing aII solution upon either community in Palestine.      We cannot useI British forces to impose a plan which is not freely accepted byil both parties in Palestine.&quot;A.C. J.Colonial Office, S.W.1.b,t!i February, 1948.
