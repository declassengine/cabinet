o *****178IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIiANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT-)CP. (48)  5.1 COPY NO.14TH FEBRUARY,  1948CABINET1948 DOLLAR POSITIONNote by the Prime minister the Economic Policy Committee, with the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Food, have had a preliminary discussion of the issues raised in the two papersby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 35) and theMinister of Food (CP.(48) 49).    In this they sought to reconcile any remaining conflict of view on the specific recommendations on food supplies which were put forward inparagraph 20 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (48) 35*   TheCommittee agreed-, with the concurrence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Food,  to submit the following recommendations on these points for endorsement by theCabinet :-(a) There should be no increase in the basic rationsuntil the position on Marshall Aid is clear.No final decision should be taken at this stage onthe question whether the temporary increase in the weeklyfat ration (from 7 oz. to 80s.)  should be continued after24th April.   The Minister of Food should moke every effort to expand still further exports of oils and fats to dollar countries;    and such exports should have first call on thesupplies required to maintain the additional 1 oz. ration.But if, v/hen provision has been made for all practicableexports to dollar countries,  supplies (which now cane whollyfrorn non-dollar sources) are still sufficient to maintain theadditional 1 oz. ration, the domestic ration could be continued at the existing level of 8 oz. a week.    In those circumstances the final decision on the future level of the domestic rationcould be taken,  at the latest possible moment before24th April, on supply grounds alone.(b) Any storable foods which may become available,  inexcess of the amounts required to maintain consumption at current levels, should be stored against future emergencies.(c) The Minister of Food should arrange (without reducingthe daily calorie intake) for storable or dollar foods nowincluded in the basic ration to be replaced, to the maximum possible extent, by other foods at present unrationed or on points.-1-
(d) The export of foodstuffs from the sterling area todollar countries should he expanded to the maximum practicableextent, even if it involves some reduction in supplies forconsumption in this country.    This policy will be applied in&apos;full consultation with any Dominion Governments concerned;and there will be no question of diverting supplies which a dominion has contracted to send to this country without thefull agreement of that Dominion.(e) The Minister of Pood should consider by what meanswe could reduce our imports of wheat from Canada in the second half of 1948 if it should prove impossible, when the financial negotiations are resumed in March, to arrange means of payment for all the supplies which we are now drawing from Canada.This enquiry should cover, not only the possibility of reducingthe bread ration, but also (in consultation with the agriculture Ministers)  such other expedients as substitutingan equivalent amount of coarse grains for the 20% of wheat which United Kingdom farmers are expecting to retain fromtheir 1948 harvest. -CR.A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1*14th February, 1948.
