(hQ)10th February,  1 9U-8.CABINETWESTERN union memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will   want to know what has been done to realise the policy laid down in my speech of 21st january and what steps I propose should be taken in the immediatefuture.The Treaties with the Benelux PowersMy colleagues will recollect that I proposed thatas a first step a hard core of the Western Union should be formed by creating a treaty relationship between France and Britain on the one hand and the Benelux Powers on the other;and that I agreed with the French Government that our twoGovernments should make a joint offer to the Benelux Powersof a treaty on the Dunkirk model.      Since then the BeneluxPowers have met in Luxemburg, and the   Minister of State hasseen their representatives in Brussels.      I append (Annex I)the account by the Minister of State of his conversations fromwhich it is clear that the Benelux Powers are reluctant toaccept a treaty on the Dunkirk model and are thinking rather ofa regional pact, possibly based on Article 52 of.the charter of the United Nations.I have at the same time been in close touch with theFrench Government. A summary of these negotiations (Annex II)shows that they are opposed to the conception of a regionalpact under Article 52 of the Charter ond recommend that our two&quot;Governments should forthwith communicate to the BeneluxGovernments as a basis of discussion the British draft of atreaty on the Dunkirk model.recommendations in order to reconcile those divergent views and makequick progress towards our goal, I recommend that we should:(1)       Communicate our draft treaty on the Dunkirk model,as M. Bidault suggests, to the Benelux Powers.      But we shouldmake it clear that we want to ascertain their views and wishesand only regard our draft as a basis of discussion.      At thesome time we should explain the reasons which had prompted usto start off with Treaties on the Dunkirk model.-1-
143(2)       Propose as a next step that the problem should beconsidered by a preliminary Five-Power meeting of foreign ministers in a Benelux capital, possibly Brussels.     Thispreliminary meeting, wlaich should take place early in March,should issue a broad directive as to the lines on which atreaty should be drafted.(3)       Meanwhile we should make a careful study of theAmerican Rio Agreement,  pacts under either Article 5&quot;!  or 52of the Charter,  the Soviet treaties with their satellites andany other suitable instrument, so that we might be able toput forward at the preliminary meeting such modifications ofour Dunkirk draft as would render it acceptable.General considerations in order to meet M. Bidault&apos;s views as for aspossible there would, in my opinion, be no objection to fallingin with his proposal that we should communicate the British draft treaty to the Benelux Powers,  always provided that we make it clear at the same time that we are treating them on a footing of equality and that there is no question of two bigpowers attempting to impose on them a form of treaty which theydo not like.      At the same time we could explain that weoriginally favoured the Dunkirk model on the ground that wewere reluctant to take any step inconsistent i*ith my statementsthat our arrangements with Western Europe were not aimed against russia.     Here we have to bear in mind the over-ridingconsideration that the intention behind the project for a western Union is not to divide Europe irretrievably, but rather to create a situation which will permit of on eventualaccommodation with Eastern Europe.Tbe ground on which I propose a preliminary meetingis that if we are to make the progress which is expected of us, we cannot afford the delays and possible misunderstandingswhich might be caused by the attempt to handle this complicatedquestion through British and French diplomatic channels in three different capitals.      I shall therefore work for a preliminary meeting of the Foreign Ministers early in March.As regards the form of the treaty,  I think it isimportant that there should be some reference to Germany, ifwe are to ovoid misunderstanding on the part of Russia.     Weshould, however, try to work in any elements of possible pactsunder Article 51 and 52 of the Charter, the Rio Agreement, theRussian treaties or other precedents which maybe useful.      Imay remark in parenthesis that the Benelux idea of a regionalpact based purely on Article 52 of the Charter is unlikely tobe satisfactory in practice.    There would of course be nothing in the Charter to prevent such a pact, but enforcement action under it would be governed by Article 53 of the Charter and,except in case of measures to be taken against ex-enemy states, could only be taken with the authorisation of theSecurity Council, which of course could be vetoed by Russia,Since it is our intention that the association whiohwill be formed by this treaty should evolve and extend, itoccurs to me that it would be an advantage to create a consultative committee of representatives of the participating
illpowers to study and collaborate in the developments ofthe Western Union in oil its forms.      Provision forthe creation of such a committee might possibly beinserted in the Treaty.      Thus everything possible wouldbe done ,to ensure that the association of the participatingpowers would be a living and growing organism.iEo B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.10th February,  1948.
145ANNEX memorandum by the Minister of state the following are the chief points from conversations which I held with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Belgium,the Netherlands and Luxemburg in Brussels on 5th February, 1948.I saw M. Spaalc, Baron van Boetzelaer, and M.   Bech separately.2e M. Spaak said that the situation was dominated bythe Secretary of State&apos;s speech of 22nd January which hadexcited the peoples of Western Europe and given them newconfidence.   He insisted that it was vital that britain should maintain the lead and argued that the following steps should be taken urgently before impetus was lost.(a) Treaties of mutual assistance should be concludedas soon as possible.   He said that none of the benelux countries favoured an agreement similar to the Dunkirktreaty since it was directed purely against Germany.   Theywould prefer some regional association under Article 51 or 52-of the United Nations. Charter.   M. Spaak stressed that sucha treaty should also refer to the Rio Agreement since thiswould appeal to public opinion in America.(b) M. Spaak was anxious that military conversations should accompany the discussions of the treaty.   He was seeking the &apos;closest staff and technical co-operation.   This wouldmean more than formal frontier guarantees.    He did not expectformal American participation at this stage although he plainlyhoped for American approval.    He felt that the best way ofultimately obtaining American help was for Western Europe togo ahead and show itself capable of action,  just as thesixteen nations had done after the Harvard speech.(c) M. Spaak was equally anxious for economic conversations.Here again he was modest and realistic and said he did not expect a Customs Union next week.   He stressed the urgency of starting these conversations before the divergencies betweenthe economic policies of the Western European Powers (typified,amongst other things, by the French action over the franc)developed further.   He argued that the existence of Beneluxprovided a means by which the sometimes narrow policies of itsindividual members could be transformed into a broad policyin-the interest of all.   While not committing myself to definiteeconomic conversations, I suggested that, were they to takeplace, they should include conversations on joint Africandevelopment as a corollary to western European economiccollaboration.   M.. Spaak said that this had a military aspecttoo.3. Both in his remarks on treaty negotiations and oneconomic matters M. Spaak made it evident that the prestige of Prance had deteriorated in the Low Countries and that,whereas British leadership would be welcome, both Belgium and holland would find it politically embarrassing if the role ofFvance v/ere to be exaggerated.
1464* M. Spaak expressed pleasure at the assurance I was able to give him that we intended to seek means to associatethe Benelux powers with the problem of Western German economic developments.5* The conversation was extremely cordial throughout.It was on all subjects strictly exploratory and emphasised the desirability of co-ordinating policy as a first stop tocollaboration.6. The Dutch Foreign Minister mode the same points asM. Spaak had done.    He stated, firstly,  that it would be necessaryto keep things moving quickly if wo were to retain the goodwillcreated by the Secretary of state&apos;s speech, secondly that his country would prefer to follow British rather than Frenchleadership, and thirdly that a treaty on the Dunkirk model wouldbe unsuitable.   His constructive proposals were also similarto M. Spaak&apos;s, namely that any treaty should be based on article 52 of the United Nations Charter, that in addition itshould have sane analogy to the Rio Treaty and that it shouldbe supplemented by a satisfactory military guarantee.   He gave the impression that while his government would wish to avoidpublicity they would be prepared to engage in military talksprivately.7* The Dutch Foreign Minister stated that his government did not expect any political embarrassment from negotiationsfor a Western Union and would not wish the matter to be delayed till after their elections.   He emphasised theimportance to his country of being associated in the formulation of economic policy for Germany.    I had the impression that theDutch reaction to the Secretary of State&apos;s speech was morecautious than that of the other two Benelux countries.8. M. Bech, Foreign Minister of Luxemburg, reiteratedall the points made by M. Spaak and Baron van Boetzelaer.He added, that he had been surprised by the great response ofthe common people in his country to the Secretary of State&apos;sspeech.   He stressed that the Socialist Party in Luxemburgin particular were giving him their full support for thispolicy.9. He made two stipulations, however.   Firstly he asked that Luxemburg should not be asked to shoulder any additionalmilitary burdens.    Secondly he urged that Luxemburg shouldnot be expected to negotiate treaties as an individual countrybut only as a member of the Benelux group, though she would ofcourse have to sign individually.H. McN.Foreign Office, S.W.I.10th February, 1948.
147ANNEX ii summary of discussions with the French GovernmentThe views of the Secretary of State on the organisationof Western Europe were communicated to Monsieur Bidault on15th January,  and hove since been discussed with him and withMonsieur Chauvel on various occasions.The two governments informed the Benelux governments on 20th January that they would jointly offer a treaty to these powers.      It had &quot;been agreed with M. Bidault that the treaty should be on the model of the Anglo-French treaty of Dunkirk.At M. bidault&apos;s request a draft of such a treaty was prepared in the Foreign Office and shown to the French on 27th January.Subsequent conversations with the French show that they aro infavour of the conclusion of separate treaties with the benelux countries.      They do not feel that it is possible to adopt thesuggestion of the Benelux countries that agreements should be concluded with their group as a whole, because &quot;Benelux&quot;  is nota political entity;    to meet this point Monsieur Bidault has suggested that it might be possible to have one text to whichfive signatures would be appended.The French consider that the Treaty of Dunkirkprovides .0 suitable model,  and are not in favour of the Beneluxproposal that a regional pact should be drawn up under Article52 of the United Nations Charter.      They are prepared,  however,to discuss the matter and M. Bidault has suggested that article  of the Dunkirk Treaty (which provides for assistance in theevent of hostilities with Germany) might be expanded to coverconsultation.As regards military agreements, Monsieur Ghauvel(Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) haspointed out that it would be a mistake to pour cold water on theproposals of the Benelux governments and suggests that we should reply that there should of course be military arrangementseventually but that the political framework must be constructedfirst.      Monsieur Chauvel gave as his own idea that Anglo-french military conversations should be completed first,  that we should then find out whet the United States Government v/ould be preparedto do to help, and after that enter into discussions with the benelux governments.As regards economic agreements Monsieur Bxdault has said that he hopes His Majesty&apos;s Government will take an active part both in encouraging customs unions, between France and Italyand France and Benelux and in devising means to participatethemselves.The French accept the draft treaty prepared as a modelin the Foreign Office and urge that it should be presented to the benelux Governments without delay in order to forestall anyconcrete counter proposal which the Benelux governments might put forward.Foreign Office, S.W.1.10th February,  19U8.
