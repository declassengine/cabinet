(48) 355th February, 1948CABINET1948 DOLLAR  position memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a report prepared by a Working Party of officials, in accordancewith the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 287. This reportrevises the forecasts of our dollar position in 1948 as set out in CP. (47) 283 andalso estimates the position in the years to come. It incorporates certain amend-ments made after taking account of the views of the Planning Board and theOfficial Committee on Economic Development and I have made certain amendmentsmyself.Comments of Planning Board and Official Committee on EconomicDevelopment2. The Planning Board agreed that the situation was extremely grave.While they generally endorsed the recommendations in the report, they made tworeservations: (a) They felt unable to express a final opinion on the detailed proposals regarding food cuts since they did not consider they had the neces-sary information to consider the matter; the Board recognised, how-ever, that some reduction in food consumption would be necessary(paragraph 20).(6) They felt considerable doubt about the advisability of seeking to reducethe consumption of dollar raw materials by raising the price(paragraph 34 (d)).3. The Official Committee on Economic Development also expressed generalagreement with the estimate of the position given in the report. while recognising the great gravity of the position, they endorsed the view that &quot; itwould clearly be wrong at this stage to take measures which would disrupt our economy&quot; (paragraph 15). They endorsed all the steps proposed (thoughindividual members reserved the position of their Departments in matters concerning them directly). The Committee also recommended that there shouldbe no piecemeal announcement of the various decisions but that a general state-ment should be made by the Government covering the whole field, the statement tobe linked with the publication of the Economic Survey.The General Outlook4. There are three main factors which make the dollar outlook one ofgreat and increasing gravity.Total Drain on Reserves in 1948.(i) The net drain on our gold and dollar reserves in 1948 is now estimatedat  100 million more than in the previous paper. This is not caused by badforecasting as will be seen from Annex A. Nevertheless I have satisfied myselfthat the present figure is realistic and that, in the absence of any major emergency,it should not be exceeded. I make only these reservations.(a) Argentina. Negotiations are not yet complete and the figure of  10million included as a dollar allowance for 1948 may not be sufficient.But there is now some hope that no dollar allowance may be needed.34900a
Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th February, 1948.(b) India and Pakistan-Negotiations are still in progress and here again the dollar allowance of  32 - 5 million (excluding drawings from I.M.F.which might be  25 million) may not be sufficient. What is quite clear from past experience is that we must have a fixed limit on our liability to provide dollars especially in the case of India.(c) Belgium. Under our existing agreement with Belgium she is free toask for gold when her balances exceed a fixed amount. During1948 we have already had to pay  5 million worth of gold under thisagreement. While we hope to balance trade with Belgium over 1948it is not at this stage clear that the provision of  10 million for contingencies, including Belgium, will prove sufficient. (See Annex A,Table II.)Rate of Decrease in Drain on Reserves in 1948(ii) The second disquieting factor is that the United Kingdom tradingdeficit with the dollar area and the net drain on our reserves decrease duringthe course of 1948 much less rapidly than we originally hoped. Thus the netdrain in the first quarter is put at  117 million; it is estimated that in the last quarter it will not fall below  92 million. The United Kingdom trading deficit in the first quarter is put at  77 million; and in the last quarter at  67 million.When full allowance is made for seasonal factors, the position is disquieting.We have, in fact, virtually cut our dollar expenditure to the minimum compatible with our present level of activity. This means that the net drain in 1949 cannotsafely be put at less than  300 million compared with the  250 million previouslyestimated.Effect on Reserves of full Marshall Aid .(iii) The final and most disquieting feature is that even if full marshall aid is given in acceptable form (as to which there is great doubt) our reserveswill decrease substantially during the first year and will almost certainly continueto decrease in subsequent years though at a lower rate.Post-Marshall position. Thus in the short term and in the long term the position is very serious.Furthermore, I must impress upon my colleagues that even with full and acceptableMarshall Aid, great and sustained efforts and considerable sacrifice will be needed by all the members of the sterling area if we are to make ourselves free from theneed for dollar aid by the time Marshall Aid ends. Marshall Aid must impelus to increase, not to relax, our efforts to make ourselves viable.Publication of Revised Figures6. The revised dollar figures for 1948 will be published in the economic survey. I agree that it would be unwise at present to take measures which woulddistort our economy. Nevertheless, unless publication of these new and muchgloomier figures is accompanied by definite measures to reduce the dollar drainit1 will be clear that we are gambling on full and acceptable Marshall Aid.This will have at any rate two grave effects: (a) Our bargaining position with the United States under the plans forMarshall Aid may be greatly prejudiced.(6) The stability of sterling and the cohesion of the sterling area may be undermined, more especially if Marshall Aid is delayed.recommendations. I therefore urge my colleagues to consider the proposals made in thereport in the light of these general considerations. The recommendationssummarised in paragraph 40 of the report seem to me to be the minimum weshould do at the present time. Action has alreadv been taken to increase coal exports as soon as possible to 300,000 tons per week (paragraph 27 (a)) and toprepare the brief for discussions with the Chairmen of the Oil Companies Inthe meantime I trust my colleagues will have no hesitation in accepting therecommendations now made. 0R.

TOP secret copy No.MEMORANDUM ON 1946 DOLLAR POSITIONIntroductionIn this paper we revise the forecast for 1948 in CP. (47) 283 and also lookfurther forward to the following years in which we shall be receiving marshall aid if the United States plans go through. But we are not yet sure that weshall get adequate Marshall Aid on acceptable terms. We have therefore con-sidered what action we should take now as an insurance against the non-receiptof Marshall Aid.If we do not receive Marshall Aid, the effect on our whole policy, at home andabroad, and on our economy will be of the gravest character. Indeed, we shallhave to take many decisions and actions which now seem out of the question.Any reasonable steps that we can take now are consequently of great importance.Revised Outlook for 1948 and subsequent years assuming no Marshall Aid2. The attached tables (Annex A) set out the revised position for 1948.In brief, our reserves of gold and dollars at the end of 1948 are now estimatedat  272 millions if we are unable to draw on I.M.F. The comparable figures inthe original forecast was  370 millions. The position is therefore  100 millionsworse than expected. These calculations exclude possible drawings by the UnitedKingdom and other Sterling Area countries from I.M.F. Our drawing rights ina 12 months&apos; period are  118 millions (United Kingdom  80 millions, India  25millions, Australia  13 millions). It is uncertain at this stage how far we shallbe able to draw on I.M.F. and how far the other Sterling Area countries will be willing and able to do so. If we were able fully to use the facilities of I.M.F.our reserves at the end of 1948 would be  390 millions. Latest developments ofUnited States policy on I.M.F. suggests that we cannot rely with certainty ondrawing our quota from the Fund. The end-1948 figure for reserves of  272millions is therefore by no means impossible. The reasons for this deteriorationare set out in detail in Annex A. The main ones are the loss of the Canadiancredit, purchases of Canadian livestock products and decrease in estimated dollarexports.3. The position is even more alarming when one examines the quarterlyfigures for 1948 given in Annex A. First, the United Kingdom deficit with the dollar Area is  67-2 millions in the last quarter, a reduction of only  10 millionsbelow the figure for the first quarter. Seasonal purchases, eg,, wheat and cottonrwhich take place in the latter half of the year, and the continuance of the Canadianlivestock contracts are partly responsible for the continuing high level of the deficit. But we have reduced our imports from the dollar area to the minimum required to keep our economy at its present level. We can therefore only hope to lessen the gap by increasing exports; there is virtually nothing we can do bydecreasing imports.Secondly, the net drain on reserves is  92-2 millions in the last quarter corn-pared with  117-3 millions in the first a reduction of &quot;only about  25 millions.Finally, assuming no Marshall Aid, we must now face the prospect of a netdrain of not less than  300 millions in 1949; while our total reserves at thebeginning of 1949 will be only  272 millions excluding I.M.F. drawings. Theprevious comparable estimate in OP. (47) 283 was for reserves at the beginning of1949 of some  370 millions, and a drain in 1949 at the rate of  250 millions perannum4. On the basis of present policy therefore and assuming no Marshall Aid,we shall begin 1949 with the certainty that we shall have virtually no gold ordollars left by the end of that year. This would clearly lead to grave financialdoubts and weakness well before the end of 1948 and also endanger the wholefuture of the sterling area.34900
Revised Outlook for 1948 and subsequent years assuming Full and AcceptableMarshall Aid5. But even if the United Kingdom gets Marshall Aid to the maximum amount and on acceptable terms it is certain that our total reserves of gold and dollars will fall during the first year of Marshall Aid. It is difficult at present to assess this fall.   But it may be substantial for the following reasons: (a) It is most unlikely that Marshall Aid will cover the dollar deficit of the sterling Dominions.(&amp;) Such indications as we have of the United States Administration^intentions suggest that they are working on the assumption that weshall in the first fifteen months receive  100 millions of dollar aid from other sources e.g., Canada, International Bank, private inyest-ment, &amp;c.   This cannot be counted on as more than a possibility.We may not be able to redress this situation by cutting imports, for it isprobable that Marshall Aid will be based mainly on our import programme fromthe Western Hemisphere and that any cutting of the programmed imports would merely reduce the total of aid pro tanto rather than reduce the drain on our reserves.If, however, we could increase United Kingdom exports to the dollar countries over the level assumed in the Marshall Plan estimates, it is probable(though not certain) that such an increase would not be set against the totalaid we get and that it would therefore assist our reserves. Such an increase in exports will not be achieved quickly, as experience has already shown.6. Furthermore, it is by no means certain that our reserves will not continueto fall during the later years of Marshall Aid: no estimate is possible at thisstage. &apos; :7. In briefj the only sound basis on which to work is that even with fullMarsha!! Aid the drain on par reserves will be substantial in the first year,and will hot disappear in subsequent years.8.   There are two further points :-(a) As Marshall Aid is to be voted annually the United Kingdom will have&apos;&apos; to negotiate before each annual quota is decided. The lower our reserves, the more catastrophic would be our position if marshall aid is hot renewed. Each year we shall go through the same difficulties and uncertainties.(b) Secondly, it is far from certain that after the end of the full periodof Marshall Aid we shall even then be able to balance our dollaraccount. In fact there is some danger that the working of marshall aid may in some ways increase our subsequent dollar deficit. It willbe of great importance not to relax in any way the policy of savingand earning all the dollars we can. Thus, to quote only one example,the fact that we are getting certain supplies &quot; free &quot; under E.R.P.must hot be allowed to interfere with pur policy of diversion tosources of supply where we Can afford to pay in the long run. Ifwe do relax the policy, the dollar deficit after the full periodof Marshall Aid will be so much the greater. Therefore the level which pur reserves reach before we get Marshall Aid is cf vitalimportance, and will affect our policy for many years to come, evenif we assume full and acceptable Marshall Aid.9. This outline of prospects, even assuming full and acceptable marshall aid, ^underlines the importance of the recommendation in paragraph 7 of&quot;That we must use Marshall Aid to get ourselves as fast as possibleinto a position in which we are not dependent upon outside economic&apos; support.&quot; &apos;Svte^of Reserve of Gold and Dollars Needed ; ,10./&quot;/We Jiaye;fold the United States Administration that the minimumreserve which we regard as reasonable and sufficient is  500 millions.  We believethat the Aa^^ijslJr^ipn /accept- -this and&apos; will&apos;; do whatever they can within the framework of the Marshall Plan to help in keeping our reserves at this figureBut as we have pointed out above there are many difficulties to be overcome - funds
would have to be voted by Congress year by year and we do not know what view the next Administration will take. It is in any case essential that we should bring the United States Administration fully up to date on this matter by giving it a full account of the revised position as now set out as soon as possible.*Size of Reserve of Gold and Dollars during 194811. In order to show bur position at various- times during this year (based&apos;on present policies and assuming no Marshall Aid) we set below our reserveposition at the end of each quarter in 1948.htvifil til stHod ?-ri bUnuU &apos;. 1stqtrReserves at beginning of period E.E.A. gold and dollars    ...      ...     .512&apos;    South African gold loan    ...      ...       80United States credit        ... 75Canadian credit      ... i.. -     .11 -Total      ............      678Net drain     ............   -117:   Reserves at end of period ...    ......   561This calculation excludes possible drawings by United Kingdom and other sterling area countries from LM.F. Our drawing rights in a 12 months&apos; periodare  118 millions (United Kingdom,  80 millions, India,  25 millions, Australia, 13 millions). As stated above it is uncertain at this stage how far we shall beable to draw on I.M.F. and how far the other sterling area countries will be willing and able to do so. If we were able fully to use the facilities of I.M.F.our reserve at the end of 1948 would be  390 millions.12. It will be seen from these figures that we shall get below  500 millionsby about the middle of this year. Furthermore, our reserves of food and rawmaterials will then be at a low overall level.General Conclusions13. It is clear from this analysis that our position will be one of great and continuing anxiety, even if we get full and acceptable Marshall Aid. We must take all practicable steps immediately to reduce the drain on our reserves, so thatwhen Marshall Aid begins they are at the highest possible level. We must also consider the steps which we will have to take to protect our reserves during theperiod of Marshall Aid.14. On the other hand if there is no Marshall Aid we shall be forced intoa very serious situation. For example, we should have to cut food consumptionconsiderably. We should have to cut supplies of raw materials to a level whichwould cause a substantial drop of production and consequent unemployment. the resulting drop in exports would begin a downward spiral. We should, in fact,have to conduct an operation as grave and difficult as that needed on the outbreakof war. It will be necessary to take decisive action, without delay throughoutthe whole economic field and to recast entirely our policy in defence and foreignaffairs. To make adequate preparation for this situation is a major administrativetask. We feel that, m present conditions of administrative pressure and in thelight of the existing likelihood that, some Marshall Aid legislation will be enacted by the United States Congress it would be unwise at this stags to give, priority to detailed planning&apos;oh ilie assumption of no Marshall Aid. It must be recognised,however, that the situation in Washington change rapidly and it may become necessary at short, notice to divert substantial administrative resources to theworking out of a plan on these lines.There is the further possibility that the Marshall legi3latio.i1 which ultimatelyemerges will be whollyinadequatertp meet our needs. This, situation also wouldrequire(substantial changes in our economic and other, policies^ , It is impossible at this stage, however, to predict the extent and nature of the inadequacy of the aid which would emerge in such conditions. The number of possibilities is verylarge and would present altogether different problems in each case. During thenext 2 or 3 months the position will be kept under continuous examination by theLondon Committee in preparing the briefs for the Marshall discussions.34900 u 9.  millionsSndqtr.      3rd qtr.       4th qtr.561 450 364561 456 364-105 -92 -92456 364        ;    272
Part IIMeasures Which Should be Taken Now15. It would clearly be wrong at this stage to take measures which woulddisrupt our economy. Nevertheless the drain on our reserves is so great that wemust take every practicable measure short of this which would reduce it. these measures are both an insurance against the absence or inadequacy of Marshall aid and in many cases will be necessary and valuable even if we receive Aid to thefullest extent.16. In considering these measures it should be borne in mind that action,even if taken now, can radically affect the position before the second half ofthe year only in the field of reducing consumption by the public or supplies to industry. Action even if taken now in the field of purchases from abroad and exports would not become operative before the second half of the year.Food17. Present estimates provide for expenditure in the second half of 1948of  8 millions in United States and American account countries and  63^ millions in Canada.There is no food purchase from the United States and the  8 millions repre-sents mainly sugar which is already contracted for, and some meat contractedfor. The sugar provided is only sufficient to maintain the 8 oz. ration and thecurrent level of supply for manufacture (25 per cent, below what was rulingtowards the end of 1947). A cut of 2 oz. in the ration and of 5 per cent, inmanufacture represents a saving of  5 millions per annum. The present time,especially with potato difficulties, does not seem appropriate to make such a cut.The Canadian supplies consist of the wheat contract plus about  15 millions in the six months for live-stock products. It includes the increase in price to $2for the 1948-49 crop. Although we shall no doubt seek once more to separate the live-stock products from the wheat contract, it is altogether uncertain thatwe shall be able to do so and we cannot rely upon it. Assuming (as we must)that we are unsuccessful the only prospect of reducing this bill is by cutting ourwheat takings and a reduction in the ration from 9 B.U&apos;s a week to 8 B.U&apos;sa week would in a six months period save about  4 millions. This reduction inour wheat takings would enable the Canadians to sell some of their wheat inother markets and would be a useful bargaining counter for us in seeking to cancel the live-stock contracts.18. The Ministry of Food have recently been authorised to- make themaximum purchases of useful food from soft currency countries. We feel thatthese supplies should be stored to the maximum possible extent against futureemergency until we know the position about Marshall Aid. In present circum-stances it would be indefensible to increase current consumption by supplies,either from hard or soft currencies, which can be stored or substituted for storablefoods. :19. We might achieve substantial additional earnings of dollars by divertingto the United States and Canada sterling area food-stuffs destined for theUnited Kingdom market. There are serious practical difficulties in the wayof diverting basic food-stuffs entering into the United Kingdom ration; evenif we could afford a further reduction in the consumption of these foods at homewe would encounter strong opposition to such a policy in the Southern Dominions.In New Zealand for instance dockers have refused to load butter cargoes for canada. But there should, in our opinion, be no alleviation in rations which involves our taking more of any food that might be sold to North America.Tea is an example. There are good prospects of earning up to an additional$20 millions from increased exports of tea, and no question of increasing the domestic ration should prevent us from going all out to get this. There are other possibilities of increasing sales of sterling area food to the dollar area at the expense of consumption here (e.g., coffee) and these should be developed to the maximum possible extent. &apos;20.   We therefore recommend that :-(a) There should be no increase in the basic rations until the position onMarshall Aid is clear and that the fats ration should be reduced to;  7 ozs. on 24th April. ) ; i;
(6) The Ministry of Food should submit proposals for the maximum possiblestorage of food whether from hard or soft currency sources.(c) The Ministry of Food should submit a programme for the maximum possible substitution of storable or dollar foods now included in the basic ration by foods at present on points or unrationed.(d) We should increase to the maximum food exports from the sterling area to dollar countries and that this should take precedence over the domestic supplies here. It is under this heading that we may securethe greatest dollar saving.(e) Urgent consideration should be given to the possibility of reducing the bread ration from 9 to 8 B.U&apos;s a week in the second half of the year,of using this to secure reductions in the wheat and livestock purchases in Canada, when negotiations are resumed in March.Tobacco21. The estimates make no provision for any new purchases of tobacco in theUnited States or Canada later this year. The effect of this on consumption andon revenue would be very severe, but there is no doubt that in present circum-stances and until the position about Marshall Aid is clear, it is the right policy.No decision is called for at present.Coal22. Distributed stocks at 3rd January were 16 million tons the same figureas at end of 1944.   The position at the end of subsequent years was :  Million tons1945      ..................      12-51946      ..................        8-5Production has again increased above 4 million tons per week and is at least250,000 tons per week higher than last winter, while consumption has been running at about the same rate as last winter yet the present programme provides for only 200,000 tons per week for export and bunkers.23. Admittedly we have Marshall commitments to export, including bunkers,13 million tons in 1948. In the Paris Report we stated that: &apos;&apos; Should the effortsnow being made prove successful and the output estimate be improved upon theUnited Kingdom hope to devote the greater part of the increase to meeting theneeds of Europe.&quot; In addition we have agreed to supply 1 million tons of coal to the Argentine (if the negotiations are successful) and 250,000 tons (with apossible increase to 500,000 tons) of anthracite to Canada.24. If we ran the same risks on coal as we are running on gold the immediateexport figure and the total export commitments for the year would be very muchgreater. Furthermore, increased exports would either earn dollars or gold orenable us to secure essential supplies for sterling. Finally, immediate increases of coal supplies should make it easier to carry out the proposals in the following paragraphs for reduction in supplies of oil to soft-currency countries.25. We can secure direct dollar savings by increasing our overall supplies to Argentina and Canada; and we consider that this should be done.26. We consider that release should now be sought from the undertaking given to industry last year that accumulated stocks would not be taken intoaccount in settling winter supplies. We believe that industry would readily accept this if the coal so saved were used for export.27.   We recommend that: (a) The present programme for exports and bunkers should immediately beincreased to 300,000 tons per week; but no announcement should bemade at present in order to enable the National Coal Board to fixsatisfactory prices.(6) Urgent consideration should be given to the possibility of providingArgentina with an additional 500,000 or 1 million tons of coal in 1948and Canada with additional anthracite.(c) Release should be sought from industry from the pledge referred to inparagraph 26.Action should be taken on these recommendations immediately andwithout waiting for full consideration of this paper.
oil   &apos; :-       &apos; &apos; -&apos;; ,   ; : - *   ...     &apos;    .......28. We attach at Annex B a note on possible savings on oil. It will be seenthat the total dollar cost of the oil programme in 1948 is about  155 millions,excluding the cost of equipment for the expansion programme which js a further 10-20 millions per year. Included in these calculations is an expenditure oi over 42* iniilions in dollars oh oil products for the soft currency countries specifiedin Table II of Annex B. In present circumstances we clearly must make themaximum possible saving under this head. But the difficulties ofjdoing so aregreat. Bunkers is the last item to cut; this reduces the field by  14f,millions.In the case of some countries (e.g., Denmark, Egypt) oil supplies are part of a trade deal under which We get substantial returns. In other cases (e.g., France,Italy and Greece) there are important political considerations. For these reasonswe cannot suggest a figure and the matter should be considered urgently by theMinistry of Fuel and Power, bearing in mind especially the commitments enteredinto in recent trade negotiations with some of the countries concerned.Nevertheless a significant saving should be made. Savings should also be made on certain other dollar items. ; - ; -i      , &apos;29. We have also considered the possibility of dollar invoicing for oil sales to non-dollar countries. There are many and grave objections to this. Neverthe-less, it may be that if there is no Marshall Aid we shall have to adopt this policy.But even if there is Marshall Aid there still may be very good reason for insisting on payment in dollars by the participating countries for their oil supplies from us.In any event we consider it essential that the countries concerned should how beput on warning that we may not be able to continue to supply oil on a non-dollarbasis whether there is Marshall Aid or not. The precise method to be adopted forthis notification if approved will require further consideration.30.   We have considered the best procedure for carrying out these proposals and we feel that early and effective action will only be possible if the Miprimarily concerned, namely, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Fuel and Power, see the Chairmen of the oil companies and put to them a definiteproposition on the two points mentioned above.31.   We therefore recommend that  &apos;   : . : ,,(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Fuel and power should as soon as possible see the Chairmen Of the oil(3bnipanies withthe object of securing substantial savings in their dollar expenditure.(b) The Departments concerned should at once prepare a. brief on this matter for Ministers.Haw Materials . , 1 h;.i&apos;Miwirun:o&apos;i 1     :        ---r\r&apos;- H(\32. Ministers have already taken decisions on measures to increase textileproduction and oh the future of the clothing ration- ; V33. The imports of raw materials from hard currency sources are very carefully screened and significant cuts in consumption or imports at this stage would have disturbing and in; some cases unforeseeable results, on the level ofproduction. For instance, a cut on non-ferrous metals (except lead) can onlybe imposed by the restriction of deliveries from source since there is ho detailedcontrol of the end uses of these metals. There is thus a serious risk that allthe consuming industries, including the most vital home users&quot; and the most desirable exports, will be affected.&apos;M;   ^e think nevertheless that in the present extremely grave circumstancessome further reductions in the consumption of raw materials must be madeQur recommendations are.that reductions should be made in the consumptionof the following materials (details of the proposed cuts are given in Annex C) :-(a) Metals.-The Ministry of Supply should make cuts in deliveries to consumers equivalent to a.5 per cent, saving on the dollar cost ofimports of all metals (including iron and steel),; and&apos; should takeurgent steps to consider how this, general cut could be so distributed1    /in ^-a?     minimise interference with &quot;vital&quot; production,   .(6) Ttmber.-The cuts here would fall almost entirely,on building; rfecon-sideratiohnf the new policy of safety.standard Gimmes; would also-De required.:

Expenditure on manufactured goods in the second half of 1948 (mostlyin United States, but some in Canada) is estimated at about  20 millions.Apart from a very small quantity of consumer goods and goods for industry, requirements of which have been screened and rescreened, this repre-sents machinery. A new procedure is going into operation for more stringentimport licensing of machinery from United States and Canada. This will, how-ever, be slow to operate: the bulk of the actual payments during 1948 will represent supplies tor which licences have already been granted or commitmentsalready made.   Some  3^ millions represents agricultural and mining machinery.We have no recommendation to make for further action on this. The utmoststringency in operating the new procedure will be required.Recommendations on Other Matters affecting the Dollar PositionExports36. We understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is arranging for a review of the machinery of Departments for diverting exports to dollar marketsto the maximum extent. The export programme has recently been reviewed and accepted. We therefore have no recommendation to make under this head; butwe must emphasise that it is of vital importance to our long-term prospects thatj we should achieve a large expansion of our exports to hard currency countries.Position of Rest of Sterling Area37. The gravity of the outlook, whether there is Marshall Aid or not, make sit essential both to inform the other members of the Sterling Area of the out lookand to urge them once more to make significant dollar economies. The main-tenance of sterling as a strong and steady medium of exchange over the widest possible area is, in any case, a vital part of our short and long-term economic policy. Moreover, it is specially necessary at the present time of currencyinstability to prevent by all means in our power any weakening of sterling. Weshall only do so if determined and co-ordinated efforts are made by all membersof the sterling area.38.   We recommend that as soon as decisions have been made (a) Dominion Governments, including Canada, should be informed of theposition, and(6) At the same time all members of the Sterling Area should be pressed totake further drastic steps to earn or/and save dollars.Part III40.   Summary of recommendations :-Food (paragraph 20)(a) There should be no increase in the basic rations until the position onMarshall Aid is clear and that the fats ration should be reduced to7 ozs. on 24th April.
ANNEX AThe 1948 Dollar Programme. Assuming no Marshall Aid    .\1.   In CP. (47) 283 it was estimated that our gold and dollar.reserves at the.end of 1947 would be  664 millions, including the full amount of the outstandingUnited States and Canadian credits. In fact, our. reserves at the end of 1947 were 657 millions on this basis.  The net drain in the fourth quarter of 1947 was 4 millions more than expected ( 174 millions against a forecast of  170 millions)&apos;(b) The Ministry of Food should submit proposals for the maximum possiblestorage of all canned and other non-perishable food whether from hardor soft currency sources. -(c) The Ministry of Food should submit a programme for the maximum possible substitution of storable or dollar foods now included in the basic ration by foods at present on points or unrationed.(d) We should increase to the maximum food exports from the Sterling area to dollar countries, and that this should take precedence over the domestic supplies here. It is under this heading that we may securethe greatest dollar saving.(e) Urgent consideration should be given to the possibility of reducing the bread ration from 9 to 8 B.U.&apos;s a week in the second half of the year,and of using this to secure reductions in the wheat and live-stockpurchases in Canada, when negotiations are resumed in March.Coal (paragraph 27)(a) The present programme for exports and bunkers should immediately beincreased to 300,000 tons per week, but no announcement should bemade at present in order to enable the National Coal Board to fixsatisfactory prices.(b) Urgent consideration should be given to the possibility of providingArgentina with an additional 500,000 or 1,000,000 tons of coal in1948, and Canada with additional anthracite.(c) Release should be sought from industry from the pledge referred to inparagraph 26.(d) Action should be taken on these recommendations immediately andwithout waiting for full consideration of this paper.Oil (paragraph 31)(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Fuel and power should, as soon as possible, see the Chairmen of the oil companies withthe object of securing substantial savings in their dollar expenditure.(b) The Departments concerned should at once prepare a brief on the matter for Ministers.Raw Materials (paragraph 34)(a) A reduction should be made in the consumption of metals, timber, linseedoil and leather on the lines indicated in paragraph 34.(6) Departments should preserve stocks to the greatest possible extent by not going above present consumption standards.(c) The policy of exporting semi-manufactures containing dollar materials should be re-examined by the Exchange Requirements Committee.(d) Departments concerned should consider whether there is any possibilityof reducing the consumption of certain dpllar raw materials by raising the price.Position of rest of Sterling A rea (paragraph 38)(a) Dominion Governments, including Canada, should be informed of theposition.(&amp;) At the same time all members of the Sterling Area should be pressed totake further drastic steps to earn or/and save dollars.41. Very tentative estimates are given in Annex D of the annual savings which might result from the above recommendations.
and we drew  3 millions less from I.M.F. than anticipated. Imports of food andraw materials from the dollar area were less than expected, but so were exports and other receipts. The rest of the sterling area, especially India, spent morethan was originally estimated and there were various expenditures, such as theloss of gold to Belgium, in the backwash of our arrangements before the suspension of convertibility. On the whole, however, the record has been reasonably satis-factory and our technique of control is greatly improved.2. On the basis of cuts made by Ministers following the recommendationsof CP.(47) 283, it was hoped to reduce the net drain on reserves to  300 millions in 1948. With full use of both the United States and the Canadian credits, andno drawings on I.M.F., this would have left reserves at the end of 1948 at about 370 millions.3. We have now revised our estimates of the list- drain on reserves in 1948and the new programme is set out in the three tables below. The new estimatestake account of the Canadian Agreement and other developments since October,but they still contain large elements of uncertainty, particularly as regards the outcome of the Argentine negotiations.4. The following table presents a broad comparison of the present with theprevious estimate of the sterling area deficit with the American continent:   millionsPrevious Programme	Before cuts	After cuts	Present	CP.

Some of the categories, e.g., Government commodity operations, are not completely com-parable between the two programmes.5. The sterling area deficit with the American Continent in 1948 is 60 millions more than previously planned. This is mainly accounted for bythe restoration of the suggested cuts in food imports from Canada (largely live-stock products) and lower estimates of United Kingdom exports to the american continent. These are only partly, offset by elimination of tobacco purchases inthe United States. &apos;6. The net drain on reserves in 1948 is now estimated at  406 millions(Table II below). Reserves at the beginning of the year were  678 millions, made up of E.E.A. holdings of gold and dollars,  512 millions; the South Africangold loan,  80 millions; the outstanding United States credit,  75 millions andthe available Canadian credit  11 millions. (As compared with the computationin CP. (47) 283, this figure of reserves excludes  60 millions of the Canadiancredit not to be made available but includes the South African gold loan of 80 millions.) Hence, reserves at the end of 1948 are now estimated at 272 millions.   This is nearly  100 millions less than previously estimated.7.   The main reasons for this lower estimate of reserves at the end of 1948are :, (1) The sterling area deficit with the American Continent is  60 millionshigher, as already noted.!      (2) About  60 millions of the Canadian credit will remain unused and notavailable at the end of 1948.(3) Under the revised Fusion Agreement,  10 millions in dollars must nowbe allowed for Germany.(4)  8^ millions in dollars is included for Curacao under an agreement on oil account.34900c

Only  10 millions is nowallowed under this head, a saving of over  50 millions.8. In estimating the level of reserves at  272 millions at the end of 1948,we take no account of possible drawings by sterling area countries on I.M.F.The maximum drawings in any full year are  118 millions, i.e.,  80 millions,by United Kingdom,  25 millions by India and  13 millions by Australia. if all possible drawings can be made in 1948, and are made, then reserves wouldbe  390 millions at the end of the year.9. An estimate of the net drain on reserves by quarters during 1948 hasalso been made (Table III). The quarterly analysis is more tentative than thefigure of net drain in the whole of 1948. The trend, however, is sufficiently clearBetween the first and fourth quarters of 1948, the United Kingdom deficit withthe dollar area falls from  77 millions to  67 millions, and the net drain on reserves only from  117 millions to  92 millions. If the downward trendcannot be accelerated, we cannot count on a net drain of less than  75 millions per quarter on the average in 1949. In other words, we enter 1949 with reservesbetween  270 millions and  390 millions (according to the amount we draw onI.M.F. in 1948) and we face a net drain on these reserves of about  300 millionsduring 1949.Tabub I.

. . ANNEX possible Savings on Oil1.   The attached tables set out the net dollar expenditure on oil estimatedat  154* millions in 1948, divided as follows :-  millions(i) Dollar operating expenses of British companies, includingcost of United States equipment ...      ...      ......       70Freicrht and tanker hire     .........      ......        16(lii) Purchases of United States oil products for resale to non-dollar, non-hard countries (including bunkers)   ...      ...       42- (iv) Other net purchases of United States oil......      ......    26154 2. About  65 millions of the  70 millions under (i) is required to maintainthe current rate of British production. Any diminution in that rate would increase the dollar drain. If we eliminate entirely new capital expenditure we might save  5 millions at the risk of losing some of our concessions in Venezuela.3. On (ii) we might save  3^ millions by refusing to supply soft currencycountries (especially Italy, Norway, Siam, Egypt, Greece) c.i.f. They would then have to do without oil or pay dollars for United States tankers.4. On (iii) we could theoretically save the whole  42  millions, but thissaving would be less because of long-term commitments.  This could be done by (a) dollar invoicing; or(6) prohibiting companies from supplying certain countries; or(c) simply not allowing the companies any dollars for purchases (exceptexchanges) from United States companies.5. In the present dollar situation, any of these methods would, in fact, cutoff supplies from these countries. The recipients of 75 per cent, of this oil areE.R.P. countries. There would be major political repercussions (France, Italy,Norway, Denmark) even though it is entirely unreasonable to expect us to paydollars to provide these countries with oil.  We should also have to face : (a) Possible loss of permanent (and profitable) markets for oil and of invest-ments by oil companies.(&amp;) Special complications arising from trade agreements, &amp;c. (e.g*, loss of use of Norwegian tanker fleet, more complications with Italy and egypt, military problem of cutting off supplies to Greece).(c) Possible breach of maritime relations, if we withheld oil from ships; of soft currency flag.(d) Possible expropriation of British bunker stocks in countries whose oil supplies are reduced.(e) Indirect political danger to our sources of oil supply;   nearly all&quot; British &quot; oil is produced in foreign countries.(/) Large liabilities for indemnities demanded from oil companies.6. As between the three methods of achieving the saving, dollar invoicing isthe least abrupt and could probably be reconciled with our monetary agreements,but involves risk of retaliatory dollar invoicing of other scarce products. refusal to permit companies to sell, even if dollars were offered&quot;(as they would be in somecases) which is the inevitable implication of the withholding policy would beimpossible to defend. Cutting off dollars from the companies would put theresponsibility on the companies, who could hardly then be expected to concentrate the cuts on the soft currency countries, irrespective of commercial considerations.7. Savings of the same type (up to the whole of the rest of the net purchases of United States oil under (iv)) could then be made by similarly withholdingoil from other non-dollar countries. This would involve all the same repercussionsas those above, and also would greatly increase the risk of our having to pay acorresponding amount of gold under our monetary agreements.8. A saving of  4 millions could be secured by immediately halting theUnited Kingdom oil /coal conversion, but this would reduce the amount of coalavailable for export by 1 - 6 million tons equivalent to  6 millions at current prices.It may be possible to make further economies in road transport by forcing traffic on to the railways at certain periods of the year.9. Saving up to, say,  50 millions would be possible on the programme asa whole, but at very heavy political and probably other cost. -?titiip$

ANNEX the following are very tentative estimates of the annual savings which, might be expected from the recommendations summarised in paragraph 40 of the memorandum:  Food-(a) Maintenance of a 7-oz. fats ration-..A 1-oz. ration represents about 88,000 tons in the year. At 150 per ton, this amounts to about  13 millions. It might bepossible to sell some of these fats in Canada, but further enquiry would be needed&quot;.........    &apos;...      ,.-(6) Diversion  of. food   exports from  the   sterling  area   to  dollar countries (i) Tea (see paragraph 19) .....    ...      ... ...(ii) Coffee       .........      &apos;.&apos;.&apos;..;./,&apos;.&apos;...,   ...      iv(iii) Citrus fruits.   In the first half of 1947 Canada imported from the United States citrus fruit, chiefly oranges, tothe value of about  3 millions. Her purchases in thesecond half of 1946 had been somewhat higher. she has recently cut these purchases by 50 per cent. , &quot;Itis doubtful, however, how much diversion can be donefrom the sterling area. Of United Kingdom importsof citrus fruit, about 80 per cent, come from Palestine(whieh will shortly be outside the sterling area), SouthAfrica and Spain. Canadian imports from the west indies might be stepped up, but it would not be safe to rely on more than  1 million under this head     ....(iv) Apples.    There is reason to believe  hat..
