IS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT       JPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 194850CONFIDENTIALCopy No.   30CP. (48) 3630th January, 1948CABINETUNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 1947-THE COLONIALQUESTIONI wish to inform my colleagues of certain decisions taken at the recent meeting of the United Nations which affect non-self-governing territories.2. We subscribe under Chapter XI of the Charter to a general declarationof colonial policy as follows :-(a) To assure, with due respect for the culture of the people concerned, their political, economic, social and educational advancement, their justtreatment and protection against abuses;(b) to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in progressive development of theirfree political institutions . . . .;(c) to further international peace and security; andj       (d) to promote constructive measures of development.....As a result, we undertake to send annually to the Secretary-General, forinformation purposes &quot; statistical and other information of a technical naturerelating to economic, social and educational conditions in the territories.&quot;3. Ever since the United Nations Organisation was established there hasbeen a persistent attempt on the part of many delegations to use this provision as! a step towards United Nations supervision or control of all colonial territories,and at the Assembly in February 1946 it was agreed that the Secretary-general should include in his annual report a summary of the information submitted.   In&apos;l the autumn a strong effort was made to set up supervisory machinery, but this wasshelved by appointing an 4rf Hoc Committee to examine the Secretary-General&apos;ssummary and analysis of the information &quot; with a view to aiding the general assembly in its consideration of this information, and with a view to making recommendations to the General Assembly regarding the procedures to be followed;in the future and the means of ensuring that the advice, expert knowledge and experience of the specialised agencies are used to the best advantage.&quot;4. My instructions to the United Kingdom representative on this Committeewere inter alia to resist every attempt to widen the scope of the Charter by recom-mendations or resolutions designed to extend our obligations.5.   In the Committee, discussion centred on three points : (a) Comparison between Colonial and Sovereign TerritoriesWe asserted that Chapter XI of the Charter gave no warrant for united nations supervision over colonial administration; that the economic, social and educational problems of colonial territories were not essentially different from! those of sovereign territories of comparable geographical and economic circum-stances; and that therefore any attempt by the United Nations to appraise orcriticise the information transmitted to the Secretary-General must be based ona comparison with the record of other countries in the same field and thus be related to world standards.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies34871
A resolution was adopted which would enable the Secretary-General, subjectto certain safeguards, to draw upon any information in the statistical offices of theUnited Nations Secretariat for the purpose of such comparisons.(b) Transmission of Political information the United Kingdom gives to the world and to the United Nations the fullestinformation on political institutions and development. We opposed the attemptto rewrite the Charter so as to provide for the submission under Article 73 (e)of political information in addition to economic, social and education information.We urged that it was undesirable from the point of view of the Colonies themselvesto bring their political and constitutional affairs into the arena of internationaldebate Nevertheless, a draft resolution was adopted noting that some Powersresponsible for the administration of Non-Self-Governing Territories hadvoluntarily transmitted information on the development of self-governing institutions in those territories, and expressing the view that the voluntary trans-mission of such information, and its summarising by the Secretary-General, were&quot; entirely in conformity with the spirit of Article 73 of the Charter,&quot; and shouldbe &quot; duly noted and encouraged.&quot;(c) Treatment of information the United Kingdom representative was instructed to resist any attempt toestablish permanent supervisory machinery. A resolution was finally adoptedrecommending that the Fourth Committee should &quot; constitute a special committeeto examine the information transmitted under Article 73 (e) of the Charter on theeconomic, social and educational conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories,and to submit reports thereon for the consideration of the General Assembly withsuch procedural recommendations as it may deem fit, and with such substantiverecommendations as it may deem desirable relating to functional fields generallybut not with respect to individual territories;&quot;6. It is worth recording that the U.S.S.R. representative proposed that theUnited Nations be authorised to receive petitions from, and make inspections of,colonial territories.   These proposals were defeated.7. The above decisions of the Ad Hoc Committee (although reversed in theFourth Committee of the Assembly) were ultimately adopted by the PlenaryAssembly. ,8.   Three matters emerge : (a) Submission of Political Information. We gave notice that as this wasnot required by the Charter, that as at San Francisco it had been expressly excluded, and that as the information regarding UnitedKingdom practice was generally available in the Library of the united nations, we could not undertake to comply with a request which was calculated to involve discussion at the Assembly of political problems and which was designed to involve and embarrass and afford a platformfor scurrilous misrepresentation at the United Nations.(&amp;) Committee to Examine Information Supplied. -It is likely that aCommittee will meet each year prior to the Assembly Meeting toexamine the information received and comment on it; but the Reso-lution carried, although very near to the margin of the authority ofthe Charter, does safeguard our position.(c) Extension of Trusteeship to Colonies. A Resolution in favour of placingcolonial territories under United Nations Trusteeship was carried in committee Four and received a tie of votes in the Assembly. Thiswould have been insufficient to carry it even on a bare majority.(Actually it was held that a two-thirds majority was required.) Weopposed this Resolution because (i) as yet there was insufficientconfidence and experience in the Trusteeship Council; (ii) the matter was entirely within the discretion of the Colonial Powers and was notrequired by the Charter; (iii) so far as British Colonies were concerned,the administration was similar to that in trust territories and theproposal retarded rather than helped the advance to self-government;(iv) Britain had obligations under treaty to the considerable part ofthe Colonial Empire composed of protected peoples and these obliga-tions could not be transferred; (v) advance to self-government was a vital part of British policy; and (vi) such a step would be resented bythe Colonial peoples themselves.
9. Undoubtedly at United Nations meetings we shall continue to meet agreat deal of prejudice, ignorance and hostile criticism. In general, however, itmay be said that the atmosphere was considerably better this year than last.In no case (except the final vote on transmission of political information) was there an actual majority of the potential votes against us, and in no case (excepti that mentioned) was there a margin of more than five votes against us. We must recognise that in these matters there is likely to.be a &quot;hard core&quot; of incon-vertible opponents namely, the Slav bloc, India, and, probably for some time atleast, the &quot;coloured&quot; nations (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti, Liberia, Pakistan,Philippines, Siam). The Arab group is apt to be capricious. In this Assemblytheir minds were occupied solely by Palestine and their votes were far moreinfluenced by antagonism towards the United States over Palestine than By the merits of any case under discussion in the Fourth Committee. After the U.S.S.R.had also pronounced in favour of the U.N.S.C.O.P. majority report, the Arabswere less intractable on colonial and trusteeship matters. The majority of theLatin American States appear to be more sympathetic and it would be well worthwhile trying to educate them. The Argentine, Brazil, Costa Rica, the DominicanRepublic, Nicaragua, Peru and Uruguay were staunch supporters and almostalways voted with us. Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico and sometimes Panama were hostile. The rest of this group varied : their attitude seems due to ignorancemore than hostility. The Western European Powers, Greece and Turkey, votedwith us on almost every occasion.10. The fact that the United States have largely come round to our pointof view in recent years, and the head-on clash between the Western democraciesand the Soviet group, combined with the increasing indignation on all sides atSoviet obstructiveness in almost every aspect of United Nations work, has put us in a fortuitously favourable position. This, however, should not be regardedas necessarily permanent. The United States are at the present moment too pre-occupied with communism to devote much time to &quot; British imperialism-&quot; Itis therefore most important to do everything we possibly can, while the presentexceptional international circumstances continue, to consolidate our position andwin as much support as we can for our colonial policy. We can do much bypositive measures and publicity to establish confidence among all but the incon-vertibles.A. C. J.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,30th January, 1948.
