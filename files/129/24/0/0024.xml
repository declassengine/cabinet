-    186ItHIS document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos; 3 government)secret copy no. S 0CP. (h8) 5k17th February,  19*4-8.cabinetSTATEMENT ON PERSONAL INCOMES. COSTS AND PRICES:ENQUIRIES RECEIVED by GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS UNDER PARAGRAPH 10Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and Notional service it is already clear that one result of the White paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd.-7321) is to promptemployers dealing with a wage claim to seek assurances frominterested Government Departments that any increase granted willbe accepted for price adjustment or othtr financial matterinvolving Government action within the definition of paragraph 10of the White paper.      Such enquiries are likely to be addressedto the Ministry .of Labour or to the Government departments responsible for price control,  subsidy, grant or other financialmatter involved.      It is of the utmost importance that departments should be prepared to deal with such enquiries and that the replies should be on uniform lines.     A difficult situation would arise if Departments felt unable to deal with the enquiries or were found to be taking differing views on the interpretation tobe placed on the paragraph.2. The object of such enquiry is,  of course,  to enableemployers to ascertain how far they could expect to be reimbursed the cost of any wage concession;    they would probablybe disposed to concede that amount as a minimum.      The tradeunions might be prepared to join the employers in these representations because they also might feel that such assuranceswould be to their benefit.5* It must, however, be realised that the White Paper is expressly designed to discourage this kind of calculation.      Theamount of a wage claim and the terms of settlement must beconsidered, by the respective sides of industry in the light ofthe principles in the White Paper.      Any prior indication of theamount,  if any, that might rank for price increase, grant, etc.would not only defeat the object of the White Paper but involvethe Government in the indirect settlement of wage claims andassociate the Government with a particular view as to the properrelationship between wages and profits in the industry concerned.I+. Accordingly, it is suggested that the following rules should be observed by 0 Government Deportment receiving an enquiryregarding the operation of paragraph 10 :-(i)    No opinion can be offered as to the likelihood of anyv part of a wage application ranking for favourable consideration under paragraph 10 of the White Paper.
(ii)    The two sides of industry, bearing in mind all the considerations set out in the White Paper, must take full responsibility for any decision reached and no assistance can be offered by the government as to what the decision should be.(iii)    It is only after a decision has been taken that the__question of a price increase or other financial&quot;matter involving Government action can be considered,5. I shall be circulating to my colleagues shortly a noteregarding the application of the principles of the White paper in the case of wages claims in regard to which negotiations hadbeen commenced or which had been lodged before the White paper was issued, with particular reference to certain difficultieswhich have already arisen.     The question of the advice to begiven by Government Departments which receive enquiries is,however,  a matter of great urgency and I ask for the immediateapproval of my colleagues for the proposals in paragraph h above..G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,. S.W.1.17th February, 19U8.
