It has deliberately been addressed to the more serious reader, and to those,  on both sides of the Atlantic,who are making public opinion.     A shorter popular version,giving a simpler treatment of the main issue,  is being prepared and will be available very shortly after thepublication of the full Survey.3. The present draft has been considered by the economic planning Board and by the Official Committee on economic development.      It incorporates as many as possible of the amendments and changes recommended by those Committees.k. Before the Survey can be completed and published,decisions are required on two questions:-(i)    The Survey assumes that the coal target for 1948remains at the figure of 211 million tons, firstput forward at the. Faris Conference.      in discussing the draft Survey, the Economic PlanningBoard considered that this figure was too low.They recommended unanimously that the targetshould be raised to the highest possible realisticfigure, which would probably be about 220 million tons, in order to provide a stimulus so that we might have an increased margin for export, both to europe and to other countries.     The general viewof the Official Committee on Economic Developmentwas that, subject to the paragraphs in the Surveybeing so worded as to avoid committing us moredeeply on exports to Europe than we were already committed, it would be advantageous to raise thecoal target,  probably to 220 million tons, but thatno final decision could be taken until the coalbudget for 191+8 has been considered.     production is already running ahead of the rate necessary to achieve 211 million tons.     I personally am infavour of accepting the decision of the Ministerof Fuel and Power on this matter, which isprincipally   one of the psychology of the miners.I have asked him to look into this matter again and he will no doubt express his views to the
Cabinet.-(ii)    Great difficulty has been found in stating the objectives of the textile industries -particularly cotton.      Ministers have recentlyconsidered proposals to develop the full exportpotential of these industries.      This would involveincreasing the labour force of the industries to760,000 by the end of 19h8,  and this target was approved by the Economic Policy Committee(E.P.0.(1+8) 2nd Meeting, Minute 2).      So large a labour force by the end of I9I4.8 could have been achieved only if immediate and drastic action hadbeen taken at the beginning of the year.      Suchaction has not yet been taken, though the wholequestion has been referred to the Labour (textile industries) Committee.      I do not think that weshould commit ourselves in the Economic Survey to production targets for the textile industries which would be appropriate to a labour force of760,000 by end-191+8.      As man-power and productiontargets should be consistent, I suggest that it wouldbe   better for the objectives of the textile industries to be based on an end-year labour forcelower than 760,000 but. none the less on the largest,labour force we can reasonably expect to achieveon the assumption that the drastic measures referred to above are taken at once.      In the survey they are based on a labour force of 760,000.,5. If the Survey is approved on 23rd February,  it willbe possible to publish it during the first week of March,lit will be best in my view, if this can be arranged with the^Opposition to postpone any debate upon it until the Budget[Debate. .JR..

FOREWORDi. The purpose of this Survey is to make a short-term review of the economic position of the country as a whole and to describe the measures proposed for meeting our difficulties in 1*948. While it glances ahead at certain pointsinto the problems of later years, it does not seek to be a long-term survey.Work on a long-term survey is proceeding, but the future is so full of uncertainty that the long-term plans must depend on the solutions that are found for our short-term problems.2. Chapter I attempts a broad conspectus of the immediate problems and the measures proposed. In subsequent chapters some of the problemsof greatest urgency are reviewed in more detail. The balance of payments,as the most urgent of all our problems, is first discussed :n Chapter II. -Thisis followed in Chapter III by a review of the spheres at home in which special efforts are needed, and acute difficulties may be encountered, in thecoming year. Chapter IV summarises briefly the proposed levels of invest-ment. Man-power, national income and consumption are then discussed in chapter V.3. Any Survey of 1948 is made difficult by the uncertainty whether UnitedStates aid will be forthcoming or what exact form it may take. In whatfollows it has been assumed that the means can be found to enable us tocontinue to import from the Western Hemisphere the minimum amounts which are required to provide the essential food and feeding-stuffs and the raw materials for a high level of employment. Since it will be shown that without foreign assistance such an assumption cannot safely be made, the survey in effect assumes that United States aid will be available at least tothis minimum extent and that it can be used to maintain the pattern ofeconomic activity here set out.4. Without Marshall aid, ill fact, we must both cut our consumptionheavily and abandon many development projects. With it, we can maintain our consumption and go ahead with our development plans.5. This Survey is based, therefore, on the expectation of Marshall aidiwhich at the time of its preparation, is uncertain in many ways. It isstill uncertain whether there will be any aid at all, and therefore all themore uncertain when any aid will come and how much there will be. one thing, however, is clear. If there is a Marshall aid programme, its appro-appropriations will be voted on an annual. basis and there will be a recurrentuncertainty of the aid which will be available year by year.. 1 &apos;--6. On no account, therefore, must the aid! be used merely to providegreater ease and comfort in the United Kingdom. There must be a constantand unremitting drive to develop additional sources of supply at home, andin any other countries which need our exports and will take them in exchange for the imports that we require. Such external aid as we may receivemust be used to enable us, by the time that is discontinued, to maintainourselves by our efforts and resources.
CHAPTER I. THE FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMSOF 1948(a) The Need to Restore Economic Stabilityi. The first objective of the United Kingdom in 1948 must be the recovery of economic stability. Without a firm and stable economy we are in grave danger of being unable to provide sufficient food for our population and materials for a high lever of employment.2. Economic stability involves both an external and internal balance.Externally we must secure a balance between our foreign payments, for our imports of food, materials and other goods and services, and our receipts from goods and services sold to foreigners. Internally we must achieve a balance between the flow of goods and services available for consump-tion and our expenditure on consumption, and between our expenditureon investment in new capital equipment and the flow of savings available from all sources.3. The problems involved in the restoration of an external balance willbe discussed in more detail in Chapter II. The problems of ihe internalbalance will be examined in Chapter V. First, however, it is important to look at the position of the United Kingdom as a whole.(b) The External Balance4. The need for an external balance between the payments and receipts of a country is very similar to the need for a balance between the income andexpenditure of a family. There are certain things that the family can do for itself; but if it wishes to buy from the outside world it must earnan income from the outside world. It can, for a time, borrow, or live on credit, or draw on its accumulated reserves; but when its borrowin&apos;.; powersand its reserves are exhausted it must be ready either to reduce its expendi-ture or to increase its sales to the outside world.5. The United Kingdom had before the war the accumulated assets ofa century of foreign investment and received a substantial income (about 200 million a year) from them. A large part of those assets ware soldduring the war and a large debt was incurred. Meanwhile the, prices of thefood and materials that we buy have risen appreciably more than the pricesof the manufactured goods that we sell.6. In our attempts to recover our balance we have greatly reduced our imports. The volume of imports of 1947 has been about three-quarters ofthat of 1938. We have at the same time appreciably increased our exports.The volume of exports in 1947 was about 8 per cent, greater than in 1938.7. This has not, however, given us a balance. There have been certainGovernment expenditures abroad, inevitable sequels of the war, which have continued at a considerably higher level than in 193S. The further rise ofthe prices of our imports during 1947 has increased our difficulties. In addition,the volume of exports (which exceeded the target in 1946) failed to expandas had been hoped during 1947. The original target we set ourselves at thebeginning of 1947 was a rate of 140 per cent, of 1938 by the end of that year.We have, in fact, achieved a rate of about 120 per cent.8. For this shortfall there are a number of reasons. The failures of fuel and power supplies in the early months of 1947 upset the balance of pro-duction and caused particular bottlenecks which greatly held up subsequentproduction. Material shortages, and particularly steel, have effected some important sections of the engineering industries. Progress in manning upthe textile industries was extremely slow until the end of the year, when the textile and clothing labour forces with a sudden spurt reached the figure set in the Survey for 1947; output during the year as a whole, however, was not sufficient to make the expected contribution towards the export targets.9. In 1948 it must be the aim to approach much more nearly to a balance.But for reasons which are explained in Chapter II that is not easy. Oursupreme difficulty is to pay for goods from the Western Hemisphere. Thedestruction and dislocations of the war have made it impossible for us to buy as much as we did before the war from Europe (and particularly eastern europe) and from the Far East. We have been obliged to buy in the western hemisphere. But the Western Hemisphere has not been able to expand inequal measure its purchases from us. We have, therefore, a particular and urgent problem, within the general problem, of finding the means to paythe Western Hemisphere.10. It is true, of course (see paragraphs 105-111 below), that we have not,for some decades past, sold as much to the Western Hemisphere as we boughtfrom there. But before the war that did not matter so long as there wasa general balance between the total of payments and the total of receipts.The lire, the francs or other currencies that we might earn by exports to otherparts of the world could be sold for the dollars or other currencies that we
needed to pay for imports from the Western Hemisphere.   But currenciesare not now, and cannot yet be, freely exchangeable the one with the other.When currencies are not convertible, a general balance between the total value of receipts and payments does not of itself solve our import problem.11. We must make the most strenuous efforts to increase our exports andto send an increased proportion of them to the Western Hemisphere whiledrawing the maximum of our imports from other markets. Thus we shallbe able to reduce the drain on our remaining reserves of gold and dollars,which alone can pay for any deficiency. But it is not possible by these methods alone to close the gap entirely during 1948.12. Our food purchases in the Western Hemisphere have already beenvery greatly reduced. If we are forced by too rapid exhaustion of our reserves to make further savings on our imports from the Western Hemisphere as the figures set out in Chapter II show to be certain in the absenceof foreign assistance that will imply a heavy cut in raw material imports.13. It has hitherto been our first objective to secure raw material imports which would maintain a high level of employment. Heavy cuts on western hemisphere materials would inevitably bring in their train not only very grave consequences -in unemployment, with its consequent sense of frustrationand distress, but they would also render it well-nigh impossible for us tomaintain even the present inadequate volume of exports.14. Our programmed imports of materials from the dollar countries formabout a quarter of all our imports of materials. Cuts designed to save a half of the dollar imports which is the least that could make sufficient con-tribution to the maintenance of the Sterling Area reserves, would reduce our total raw material imports by about one-eighth. Since, however, only alimited range of materials are affected, the supplies of these would be reducedby about one-fifth.15. In whatever way we decided to make such cuts, the consequences to industry and to the volume of production would be very grave. It wouldin any case be impossible to hope that materials could be allocated with suchprecision as to avoid more general dislocation. In some cases, where dollarmaterials represent a large fraction of the whole, it would be impossible toavoid large-scale unemployment.16. If we were driven into such a situation, a drastic revision of ourcapital development plans would be inescapable. If steel and manpowerdevoted to machinery could buy us food and materials in 1948, we shouldbe forced to export the equipment wholly without regard to the contributionit could make to our economic prospects even two or three years later.17. If, in the absence of Marshall Aid, we are seriously short of western hemisphere food and materials, we shall be forced in self-protection to adoptmeasures which will retard not only our own recovery but also that of western europe. We shall be obliged to divert to Western Hemisphere markets, wherethey can buy us our imports, the coal and other key commodities which might otherwise help to restore Europe.18. We do not yet know whether United States aid will be available or in what forms or upon what conditions it may be given. But one thing is clear.If aid is given to us, we must-use it, to the limit of our freedom to do so,for recovery and not for relief: to make it more certain that when the time comes for us to rely on our own resources to pay for our necessary imports,we shall, in fact, be in a position to do so. If, as is possible, assistance wereto take the form of assuring us temporarily of certain imports, it would be disastrous if that were to lead to any relaxation of our efforts to build up the exports which would pay for these imports, or to any relaxation of our efforts to develop the new sources of supply which could enable us to dispense withthose imports for which we can see no long-term means of paying.19. The general problems of a balance with the Western Hemisphere are discussed in paragraphs 99-132 below. There are two points of special importance that must be mentioned here.- 20. The restoration of a balance in the long term will almost certainlyrequire not only an increase of our exports, up to the limit of our ability,but also some continued contraction of our imports below the level of 1938.If in the long-term adequate supplies of imported materials are to be availablefor industry, our food standards will depend increasingly upon the outputof British agriculture. Far-reaching plans to expand agricultural output havebeen announced during 1947. Some of the immediate difficulties confrontingthis expansion are discussed in Chapter III.21. The recovery of a balance with the Western Hemisphere means in-creased imports from Europe, the British Commonwealth, and the colonial empire. The development or expansion of supplies from these areas is a central aim of the Government&apos;s long-term policy. For the ultimate elimination of our deficit with the Western Hemisphere we cannot rely solely on increased exports to the markets of the United States, Canada and the Argentine.  We
needed to pay for imports from the Western Hemisphere.   But currenciesare not now, and cannot yet be, freely exchangeable the one with the other.When currencies are not convertible, a general balance between the total value of receipts and payments does not of itself solve our import problem.11.

The general problems of a balance with the Western Hemisphere are discussed in paragraphs 99-132 below. There are two points of special importance that must be mentioned here.20. The restoration of a balance in the long term will almost certainlyrequire not only an increase of our exports, up to the limit of our ability,but also some continued contraction of our imports below the level of 1938.If in the long-term adequate supplies of imported materials are to be availablefor industry, our food standards will depend increasingly upon the outputof British agriculture. Far-reaching plans to expand agricultural output havebeen announced during 1947. Some of the immediate difficulties confrontingthis expansion are discussed in Chapter III.21. The recovery of a balance with the Western Hemisphere means in-creased imports from Europe, the British Commonwealth, and the colonial empire. The development or expansion of supplies from these areas is a central aim of the Governments long-term policy. For the ultimate elimination of our deficit with the Western Hemisphere we cannot rely solely on increased exports to the markets of the United States, Canada and the Argentine.   We
must also reduce our imports from those countries. At the same time, therestoration of multilateral trade and convertibility, of currencies is necessary-to a satisfactory long run solution.(c) The Internal Balance22. The need to achieve an internal balance is closely interwoven with theneed to achieve an external balance. The export targets require for theirfulfilment both a diversion of goods from the home market to export and ashift of man-power into those exporting industries which are at present under-manned in both cases the shift is only likely to occur if the purchasing powerof the home consumer is not too great.23. The effects of the crisis of August 1947 were almost all inflationary.The cuts imposed on imported foods contracted the volume of goods to be bought without equivalent contraction of incomes and expenditure. Theincreased export targets had the same effect.24. There was at the same time a further potential source of inflation_the scale of new capital investment programmes. Such investment createsincomes and consumers&apos; expenditure immediately and only adds after an interval, if at all, to the flow of goods for consumption. If it is not to beinflationary it must be matched by equivalent willingness to save, or byenforced saving. The programmes that had been planned for 1948 were notin themselves excessive in the light of the inevitable postponement of replace-ment and maintenance during the war years. But, to judge from recent experience, the saving necessary to provide for the amount of developmentplanned would have exceeded the voluntary saving actually made and wouldhave needed to be supplemented by a substantial withdrawal of purchasingpower through an excess of taxation over Government expenditure.25. A review of the capital development programmes was undertaken andhas resulted in the postponements already announced which in a full year should reduce the rate of gross investment in fixed plant and equipment byabout  280 million below that originally expected for 1948 and by about  230million below the rate of mid-1947. In the actual year 1948 the reduction willbe lower because it will take time to come down to the new level. The actualreduction expected for 1948 is  180 million.26. The purpose of this reduction was not merely to mitigate the inflation-tionary pressure. It was primarily designed to diminish the claims of thehome market on certain types of machinery which were certain to command a ready market abroad and to release steel for the manufacture of exports.But whatever the purpose, the result was anti-inflationary.27. Apart from the cuts on capital development other measures have beenadopted which will be anti-inflationary in their effects. First the already considerable planned reduction in the size of the Armed Forces has been further accelerated. The total of the Forces and of men on release leave isnow expected to be reduced by 667,000 between mid-1947 and end-1948.These, if materials are available, will make a very considerable addition tothe value of the national output without a fully corresponding addition toincomes and expenditure.28. Second, substantial reductions have been made in other government expenditure, more particularly abroad. The effect of these and of the reduc-tions in the size of the Armed Forces is to increase the possible budget surplusresulting from existing rates of taxation.29. Finally, the supplementary budget of November 1947 has providedfor a substantial increase in the prospective surplus on the public accounts.It is now estimated (see Table XXIV below) that including both the centralgovernment and the local authorities and treating war damage payments and E.P.T. post-war refunds as capital payments, the nation&apos;s savings in 1948will be increased by  275 million from public revenues.30. It is not easy to measure at all exactly the probable effects of all these measures on the inflationary pressure. Such an analysis as is permitted bythe necessarily uncertain statistical estimates is attempted in Chapter V below.31. The replacement of the cuts on food from Western Hemisphere sourcesby additional&apos; imports from elsewhere has gone further than had earlier been thought possible, and the inflationary pressure due to diminished supplies of imported goods will, therefore, be less than had been expected.32. There remains, nevertheless, substantial doubt (see paragraphs 267-80below) whether current voluntary saving will be sufficient to prevent inflationary pressure, given existing levels of Government expenditure and taxation. Thisdoubt exists even if we can continue to import materials, so that the national production can reach the level estimated in paragraphs 249-52 below. If, onthe other hand, heavy cuts in raw materials had to be imposed, and most ofthe resultant loss of output had to be absorbed (in order to maintain exports)by reduced consumption, we should unquestionably find ourselves in an inflation-tianary position.
33- The practical consequences of inflation need hardly be stressed. It hasa two-fold effect. It reduces the real purchasing power of all whose incomesare fixed or only rise after an interval, and increases the real purchasingpower of those who are in a position to earn profits by exploiting the marketsin which rationing and control are impracticable. It diverts manpower and resources to making less-essential products for the home market and make sit increasingly difficult to compete in the export markets.(d) The Need to Redeploy our Man-Power34. The expansion of our exports (particularly of those exports that are shown to be necessary to our bilateral negotiations), the increase of agriculturaloutput and the contractions of capital development and some forms of con-sumption at home will require a continued redeployment of our man-powerand of our industrial resources. Certain industries (coal, textiles and agri-culture in particular) are under-manned in relation to our present needs.Other industries and services are in danger of continuing to absorb a largervolume of resources than we can in present conditions afford.35. This redeployment of man-power and industrial capacity must involvedisturbance both to individual workers and to individual emplovers. Rutthe guidance of man-power into work of national importance will be easierif the latter is not less well paid in comparison and if the pull, throughinflation, of competing less-essential employment :s reduced.36. A system of Government-fixed maximum wages, designed 10 keep therewards in less-essential occupations in some fixed relation to more essentialoccupations, would be neither desirable nor practicable. It is, however, very desirable that negotiations on wages between the two sides of industry shallbe conducted in such a way as to avoid competition between industries whichwould lead either to a restoration of the previous adverse position of certainunder-manned industries, or to successive cycles of wage rises, producing afurther inflationary effect.37. Reference has already been made to the measures designed to curbthe inflation. The guidance of men and women into work of national importance was one of the measures prepared by the Government during the crisis of August and more recently covered by legislation. The first resultsshow a marked increase in the intake of &quot;labour into the undermannedindustries and a marked reduction of wastage.(e) The Limiting Factors in 194838. The redeployment of industry will, however, have to be carried throughin the face of certain serious shortages. Indeed, the recovery of the UnitedKingdom and its power to contribute to the recovery of Europe will bedominated in 1948 by three major shortages: a shortage of dollars; a shortageof steel; a shortage of fuel and power. These wilf be the main limitingfactors.39. The shortage of dollars is decisive to our prospects. Much of ourbasic food comes from dollar sources; so does a large part of our raw materialsupply; we depend heavily upon supplies of petroleum from dollar sources,without which road transport, agriculture, shipping and important sections ofindustry would be crippled; we buy important supplies of machinery fromthe United States. In the absence of dollar supplies, we should be facedwith the necessity for serious reduction of our whole industrial and commercialactivity. Even at best, assuming full assistance from the United States, theshortage of dollars will impose limits on our power to buy imported supplies(even if they are available) on a sufficient scale to eliminate bottlenecks inour own production.40. The shortage of steel will affect British industry more directly. Through-out .the engi Turing industries levels of output will be dictated very largely by steel supplies. It is, as far as can now be seen, impossible to find enoughsteel to provide simultaneously for the full attainment of our export targets,for agricultural expansion, for the needs of the mines, for expanded oil production and refining, for an absolute minimum of new factory construction and new industrial equipment, for the prevention of further deterioration of the railways, for the construction of new ships made imperative by our need to save dollar expenditure, and for a minimum scale of other uses.The expansion of the engineering industries, which from a long-term pointof view is almost certainly necessary, has reduced the available steel per head in those industries well below the pre-war level, and an inevitableconsequence has been interruptions to the flow of production through shortages of materials. The planned expansion of steel output will only begin toshow significant results in two or three years&apos; time. The pre-war scale ofimports cannot be obtained for the time being, though every effort will bemade to secure the greatest amount possible.
6i6gi-841. This widespread disproportion between materials and employment inmanufactures is a major cause of low output per head, and thus low efficiency in some industries. It is in part due to world shortages. It is also partly due toour having achieved a higher level of industrial employment than this country has ever known and to the changing pattern of that employment. Thescale of equipment of the British basic industries had been geared in thethirties to a substantially lower level of activity.42. The shortage of coal imposed a direct limit on industrial productionduring the early part of 1947. Thanks to the great efforts made in 1947, coal supplies to industry in 1948 should be adequate to cover its needs. the domestic consumer will get substantially less than he would like, since ailthat is possible must be spared for export. The resumption of coal exportsearly in 1948 was a milestone in Britain&apos;s recovery, even though the supplyof coal for export will be far less than sufficient to meet even the urgent needsof those who in pre-war years relied on our supplies.43. To save coal, there has been a large scale conversion of industrial plant to oil firing. The supply of oil has recently become increasingly difficult, andit is doubtful whether the available supplies will be sufficient to meet our fullneeds. This has made it necessary to slow down the coal-to-oil conversionprogramme.44. To these major limitations must be added a number of other limitations. -There, are shortages of certain basic raw materials, such as chemicals likesulphuric acid, caustic soda and soda ash. There are shortages of certain essential forms of industrial equipment, of which card clothing and containersare typical examples. There are shortages of a number of important engineer-ing components, such as electric motors, ball-bearings and precision chain.Each of these seriously affects production in one or more industries.(f) The Fundamental Problems- 45. The year 1948 is a year of transition. Thus, the pattern of 1948 mustbe judged not only, nor even principally, by the needs of 1948 itself. Itmust be judged also by the progress during the year towards the more stableposition that we must reach. Despite immediate raw material shortages itmust be our long-term policy to expand manufactures at the expense of services. Despite grave immediate shortage in the home market it must be our aim to expand exports. Despite a lack of immediate balance between thedestinations of our exports and the sources of our imports, and despiteimmediate difficulties of convertibility, we must make a great attempt to achieve the steady expansion of ex/port trades in those directions which our long-term needs dictate. Despite the shortage of steel we must endeavourto maintain the flow of capital goods into our industries and for overseas development, more particularly in the Colonies.46. The problem which overshadows all others in 1948 is that of therestoration of our external financial solvency. If we fail to make the necessaryreadjustments of the pattern and scale of our . imports and exports beforethe end of the time that may be vouchsafed to us by our own reserves and byany aid that we may receive, there can be one consequence only: inability to buy the food &apos;and materials necessary to maintain and employ our people.To that central problem all else in 1948 must be subordinate. The amenities,even our less essential needs, must take a second place.47. Our present reserves, together with any further help that we may receive from outside, must be regarded as a strictly limited fund upon whichwe can call to balance our overseas payments for a limited period. Duringthis we must so expand our own resources and those of the British Common-wealth and Western Europe as to make us independent of the necessity forfurther drawing upon these resources by the time that that limited period. which cannot be more than a few years-has expired.CHAPTER II.-THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN&quot; 1948(a) Introductory48. It was made clear in Chapter I that the central problem of the UnitedKingdom economy in 1948 and for the next few years must be the restorationof our external balance. The economic independence and strength of thenation depends almost entirely on that.49. While we may for a short period be able to maintain ourselves by borrowing or by living on our reserves of gold and foreign currencies, theremust soon come a time when the imports that we can continue to buy will depend wholly on the exports that we can succeed in selling. We must beready to stand on our own legs as soon as possible. A balance in our inter-national payments implies no more and no less than the need to regulate our national life so that our outgoings are not in excess of our earnings.50. The external balance of the United Kingdom has been gravely upsetby the war and by subsequent events.   During the war, because of the need
to divert men and materials to the making of munitions, the volume of exportswas reduced to less than a third of that of 1938. A large part of ouraccumulated foreign assets was sold and heavy sterling debts incurred.51. When the war ended, it was clear that it must be a matter of considerable time before a balance could be restored. The American and Canadian credits,together with other temporary borrowings, provided an essential means offilling the gap between our receipts and our payments in the meanwhile. Inthe first eighteen months after the end of the war considerable progress was made.By the fourth quarter of 1946 exports had been increased to 111 per cent, ofthe level of 1938, and the total value of exports in 1946 greatly exceeded the target.52. But for three reasons, progress in 1947 has been disappointing. First,owing to the rapid rise in world prices of food and raw materials (the averagef.o.b. price of our imports was about 30 per cent, higher at mid-1947 manat mid-1945), the purchasing power of the American and Canadian creditswas reduced, and a given volume of our exports bought less imports.53. Second, it became increasingly clear that within the general problemof shortage of foreign currencies was the special problem of the shortage of dollars.54. Third, for a variety of reasons, chief among which was the fuel shortageof the winter of 1946-47, the expansion of our exports was appreciably slower than had been hoped, and the volume of exports had only risen to 117 percent, of 1938 by the fourth quarter of 1947.55. The pressing shortage of dollars to-day springs immediately from the exhaustion of the dollar credits obtained in 1945. But its causes lie deeper.The war years saw an immense increase of our dependence on supplies from american, and particularly North American, sources. These supplies were paid for during the war years and the same has largely been the  in thepost-war years out of loans or gifts. There has not yet been built up acountervailing flow of exports to pay for them.56. The continued dependence on the American Continent has been largely a consequence of the slow recovery of Europe and the Far East. The countries that we have the means to pay have not as yet the goods to send us.57. By great economy we have progressively reduced our dependence on western Hemisphere sources of supply. In 1938 (see Table VII) we drew31 per cent, of our imports from the Western Hemisphere. By 1946 this proportion had risen to 49 per cent. In 1947 it was reduced to .44 per cent.The severely cut import programmes for 1948 bring the figure down to 34 percent. But largely for this reason we have had to plan our total imports for1948 at just under three-quarters of the volume of 1938.58. Even this much reduced figure cannot be covered with our western hemisphere earnings. Before the war we earned dollars not only by directexports but also, and to a very large extent, by triangular trade. It is a major obstacle to an effective balance of payments with the western hemisphere that the whole world is short of dollars and that it is, for the timebeing at least, virtually impossible to acquire dollars by export to third countries. Without convertibility of other currencies into dollars the achieve-ment of a satisfactory balance of payments with the Western Hemisphere isalmost certainly impracticable. But convertibility alone cannot solve theproblem unless the world in total can earn sufficient dollars to pay for thetotal exports of the United States and the other dollar countries. For con-vertibility pre-supposes that some third country has succeeded in earning,and is willing to sell, the currencies which the United Kingdom needs toacquire.59. In order to make clear the nature and dimensions of theae problems,the forecasts of exports and the programmes of imports in 1948 are set out below, and the consequent balance of payments is then estimated.(b) The Export: Targets far 194860. A new set of export targets for all important industries was published in September 1947. The aim announced was to increase the rate of exportsto 140 per cent, of the 1938 volume by June 1948, and to 160 per cent,by December 1948. The targets were expressly stated to be provisional and they have subsequently been under detailed discussion with industryin the light of the availability of raw materials and the import restrictions in foreign markets.61. For the most part they have been accepted as reasonable but in somecases it has proved necessary to revise them. For this there have beenthree main reasons:  (a) Saturation of markets. There are indications that in some of our most important markets it is becoming increasingly difficult to sellsome of our products. At the same time, as a result of the difficultiesof many countries in finding dollars to meet their deficits with theUnited States there is a widespread tendency to impose import

It will be seen that the actual sum of the end-year targets would be153 per cent, of the volume of 1938. The comparable total of the earliertargets was 164 per cent, of 1938. Some small allowance must be madefor the possibility that shortfalls in a few industries will not be balanced bysurpluses in others. In the September targets the 164 per cent, total ofthe targets was expressed as a national target of 160 per cent. It is nowproposed to express the revised national target as a volume of exports150 per cent, of 1938.64. The export targets shown in Table I are targets of the rate of exportat a moment of time the end of 1948. To translate them into recordedexports during 1948 it is necessary to estimate what volume of exports will bemade against the targets in the first and second halves of 1948. Table IIshows the estimated volume of exports in each half year in the main categories of United Kingdom exports.Table IIExports of United Kingdom Produce 1947-48By Commodity Groups(Volume of 1938=100)		1947			1948 (forecast)			1938					July-Dec.

The above table excludes re-exports.restrictions on less-essential goods. These are often applied to our exports as well as those of the United States. This is particularlyserious where the effect of the restrictions is to exclude us from ahard currency market.(b) Shortages of Materials__The serious shortage of steel (see paragraphs158-82 below), somewhat aggravated by our inability to acquire the steel imports that we had hoped, has made it necessary to revise the production plans for certain types of machinery and vehicles.While the greater part of the cut-back has been taken on the home-market, the needs of British industry and the home consumer are such that export targets cannot remain wholly unaffected.(c) Textiles__To make good as much as possible of the reduction of exports from these causes, the export targets in the textile indus-tries, principally cotton, are to be raised (see paragraphs 194-204below). The desirable markets for cotton goods are believed to beable to absorb still larger exports, if we can make them available.These exports have the particular merit that they are in almost all cases either direct dollar-earners or (through reductions in thedemand of sterling area countries for American textiles) dollar-savers.62. The revision of the export targets is still proceeding. When the newdetailed targets have been worked out, they will be published. The finaltargets will be stated in terms of percentages of 1938. For the purposes of convenience these percentages are translated into values at 1948 prices;but it is the percentages and not the values which form the targets. Table Ishows for broader categories of products the total of the targets that it is nowhoped to set:  Table I summary of Proposed Export Targets(Monthly rates at end 1948)
6169X ii65. In any comparison of the estimated exports of 1948 with the targetsset for the end of the year, there are three points which must be borne inmind. First, the targets are rates of export at the end of the period in afull month of 26 working days; the actual period July-December, 1948, will,on the other hand, contain the greater part of the year&apos;s holidays. Second,some of the exports should be building up towards their targets very rapidlyat the end of the year; this is particularly true (see paragraphs 194-204 below)of the textile exports; these higher rates will increase exports in 1949 ratherthan during 1948. Third, in making a reasonably cautious forecast of actualexports and receipts from exports, some small allowance must be made (as was suggested in paragraph 63) for shortfalls. When these three points are taken into account, the export forecasts are consistent with the targets shownin Table I.66. From the point of view of the protection of our exchange reserves, themost valuable exports are those sold to the Western Hemisphere. Table IIIshows the estimated expansion of the volume of exports to the Western hemisphere-sphere and to the rest of the world respectively.Table IIIExports of United Kingdom Produce, 1947-48By Destinations(Volume of 1938=100)		1947			194s			1938	Jan.-June	July-Dec.

The proportion of all exports which are forecast to go to the western hemisphere, after allowing for the planned measures of diversion, is asfollows:  Table IVProportion of Exports going to Western HemispherePer cent.1938        ..................... 17-51947-January-June ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 14-July-December ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 15 11948-January-June (forecast)      ...       ...       ...       ... 15-3J uly-December (forecast)     ...       ...       ...       ... 15-868. While the proportion forecast to go to the Western Hemisphere is slightly lower than before the war, it is a lower proportion of a considerably larger total(see Table III). The exports to the Western Hemisphere have in the past been mainly co&apos;mposed of a comparatively few commodities, and the assumedincrease in these is as great as is at all likely to be possible. Any further increase must come from a considerable widening of the range of commodities.We may hope considerably to increase our exports to Canada and the Argentinein this way. In the United States we are making great efforts to increase our exports, but any really large growth could come only from a radical changein the importing habits of that country.69. For the purpose of the balance of payments, it is necessary to add theappropriate estimate for re-exports and also to adjust the estimates of thevolume of recorded exports, which are given above, to allow both for the expected course of export prices and for the time-lags between recordedexports and payments received. When these adjustments have been made theestimated values of exports to be carried to the balance of payments areas follows:

The estimate of  1,500 million for the receipts for the whole year is somewhat lower than the earlier estimate of  1,550 million given to the House ofCommons on December 18th, 1947. This is in part the result of the revised estimates of the volume of exports that will be made against the targets. Itis in part the result of a revision of the assumed prices of the exports as a resultof closer examination of the implied terms of trade.(c) The Import Programmes for 1948.71. The import programmes for the first half of 1948 have been drasticallyrevised in the light of our present exchange difficulties. The main principles which have governed their composition have been the reduction of alldollar purchases to an absolute minimum, the greatest possible diversion of purchases to other sources of supply, with some freedom (more particularlyin the case of food) to make good in other &quot; softer &quot; markets the cuts whichhave had to be imposed in the dollar markets.72. The Western Hemisphere programmes are no more than sufficientto maintain the nation in health and working efficiency. The standard offood consumption that they afford will be discussed in Chapter V below. Itwill be seen in Table VII that total programmed imports of food in the first half of 1948 are at about the same annual rate as those of 1947, and only three-quarters of the 1938 rate of import. The 1948 imports include a somewhat larger volume of feeding-stuffs than could be obtained in 1947. a significant part of the total of 1948 food imports is made up, moreover, offoods, such as fresh fruit, fresh and canned vegetables and miscellaneousprocessed foods of somewhat inferior nutritional value which have been pur-chased in &apos;&apos; softer &apos;&apos; markets to give some variety to the diet in the place of theWestern/Hemisphere foods which it has been necessary to cut; these do not make up for the substantial reductions in the consumption of the staple foods,as is immediately apparent from Tables XXVIII and XXIX.73. The raw material imports are judged to be the minimum that will maintain a high level of employment in 1948, though this is subject to certainqualifications. Softwood supplies have been cut to a point which requires a substantial adjustment in the building programme and steel imports are,as already stated, much below the desired level. Apart from these individual cases, the general level is insufficient to allow any substantial increase in production in many industries. It will also tend to limit desirable expansionsof man-power in certain sectors or lengthening of hours in industries where such a measure might, by increasing the output of particularly scarce com-modifies, have important general consequences. Above all, these import programmes inevitably make no allowance for the general increase in stocksof materials which is a prerequisite of a smooth and rising rate of productionper head. Stocks of basic raw materials are, on the whole, already atminimum levels, and they will remain so throughout 1948. Clearly, with our financial reserves at so dangerous a point, we cannot afford a heavy investment in additional materials, but clearly also such an investment would bring agood return, and it must remain an important object of import policy to achieve it so soon as opportunity offers.74. The effect of the programme revisions has been almost wholly to eliminate food purchases in the United States. The greatest possible economy of dollars has been the objective both in-Canada and in the Argentine. TableVI shows the estimated expenditure on imports under the main programmesduring the first half of 1948. The totals are divided for the first half of1948 between the different areas of supply. The figures are estimates ofexpenditure at current prices and the differences between years are thus theresult of differences both of volume and of prices.

In order to make possible a comparison of the imports planned for thefirst half of 1948 with those of earlier years, the quantities of imports shownin Table VI have been revalued at constant prices. Table VII shows thevolumes so calculated of the planned imports for the first half of 1948 and earlier years.Table VIIImport Programmes, 1947-48(a) Volume of Retained Imports by Commodity Groups (i938= roo)-	1938 Actual	1947 Actual	1948 1st Half ProgrammeFood and Feedingstufis ...	100	75	75Raw Materials	100	77	79Petroleum (Civil)	100	93	127Manufactures and Other Imports	100	57	45Total    ...   -............	100	74	73Note.

This table is based on a revaluation of total imports at July, 1947, f.o.b. prices.It is not possible to analyse by sources the goods that are re-exported, and Table VII(6)includes imports subsequently re-exported. Since goods imported for re-export have declined more than retained imports, the reduction below 1938 is greater for total importsthan for retained imports.76. The import programmes for the second half of 1948 have not yet been finally decided. For reasons which are set out below, in paragraphs 92-6,if Marshall Aid is not available it will not be possible to continue to importfrom the Western Hemisphere even on the substantially reduced scale ofrecent months. If, on the other hand, Marshall Aid were to come into effectduring the next few months, it might be practicable not only to maintainexisting levels of Western Hemisphere imports, but also to make certain very necessary improvements not only in raw material imports but also in food&quot;and in other categories. Thus preparations are being made for either ofthese alternatives.(d) Invisible Receipts and Payments.77. Before the war, income on invisible account was an item of major importance in the United Kingdom balance of payments. In 1938 our netearnings were some  232 million sufficient to pay for over a quarter of our imports of that year.78. In 1946, largely in consequence of heavy Government expenditureabroad, we had a large deficit on invisible account to add to our deficit onvisible exports and imports. In 1947 the deficit increased rather thandiminished, mainly because the miscellaneous net receipts from remittancesand other earnings declined very considerably.Table VIImport Programmes, 1946-48(  million at current f.o.b. prices)
6i6qi 1479. Since 1946 Government expenditure abroad has been greatly reduced.Table VIII shows the drastic cuts that have been made in military expendi-ture, relief and rehabilitation and the cost of Germany; the last is particu-larly important as it caused a drain of dollars. In 1946, and to a lesser extent 1947, there was some net income under &quot; other Government pay-ments,&quot; largely owing to the sale of commodity stocks abroad, includingwool.   These sources of income are now exhausted.80. The remaining invisible items need little comment. Our receipts frominterest profits and dividends are now very much reduced, and against themmust be set heavy additional obligations for payments of interest and repay-ment of loans. The heavy war-time losses of United Kingdom shipping arereflected in the low figures of net shipping earnings; in 1947 the excess of receipts over payments for shipping was only  17 million, and in 1948 is not expected to exceed  43 million.81. A deficit on &quot; invisibles &quot; is a new phenomenon in the United kingdom balance of payments. The cuts of overseas Government commitments, thereduction of film and travel expenditure, the rebuilding of our shippingfleet will, it is estimated, reduce the deficit from the  226 million of 1947 toabout  65 million in 1948.82. We cannot, however, look for a return to the pre-war position. Inthe near future we shall have obligations to begin loan repayments to theUnited States and Canada. The additional interest payments are likely togo far to offset improvements in shipping income and any further reductions of Government expenditure that may be practicable.83. We cannot, in short, budget for the near future on the basis of anysubstantial surplus on invisible account, even when everything possible hasbeen done to stimulate travel in this country and other forms of invisibleexports. This must mean that in the coming years we shall have to pay for our visible imports wholly by visible exports.table viiiinvisible receipts and payments 1938 and 1946-8(  millions at current prices)	193S	1946	1947	&apos;94s 1 st Half	194S YearGovernment Expenditure Overseas : Military less War Disposals and Settle-ments         ...

The over-all deficit for the first half of 1948 is estimated at  136 million and that with the Western Hemisphere at  183 million. The implications of the estimated net surplus of  47 million with the world outside the western hemisphere are discussed in paragraphs 119-27 below.86. For the year as a whole, it is estimated that if imports continued atthe same general level as in the first half of 1948 (making allowance forseasonal factors, etc.) they would amount to about  1,670 million for thewhole year. Exports and re-exports have been estimated at about 1,500 million, and the net- deficit on invisibles at  80 million. This wouldgive an overall deficit of  250 million. This figure has been used for thenational income estimates in Chapter V.(f) The Gold and Dollar Reserves87. While the largest call upon the reserves of the Sterling Area is forour own direct deficit with the Western Hemisphere, there are a numberof other claims on them as well as other supplies of gold and dollars whichhave to be taken into account. iDetails of these are shown in the followingTable: -Table x&apos; Change in the Gold and Dollar Reserves, 194O-4S(including United States ami Canadian Credits)	  million			1946	&apos;947 (provisional)	1 st Half 194S (forecast) &apos;5i 45C) 3&apos;1.

The provisions made in Table X for the net dollar expenditure ofthe rest of the Sterling Area represent the lowest figures to which, afterconsultation, it is believed to be practicable to reduce the outgoings duringthe first half of 1948, and make no allowance for contingencies of any kind.89. Our reserves at the beginning of 1948 were about  600 million excluding the balance of the Canadian loan beyond our agreed drawings to end-March.(e) The Balance of Payments84. The above estimates for the first half of 1948. are brought together inTable VIII to show the balance of payments on current account: 1

Any drawings will reduce the figures of the estimated loss of reserves by an equal amount.(a) Including sale and redemption of securities and other external capital assets, e.g.,Argentine Railways in 1948  150 million.It will be seen from Table X that during the first half of 1948 they are estimated to be reduced by about  142 million, after allowance for receiptof the whole  80 million of the South African gold loan. This would leavereserves at the middle of the year of, say,  450 million.90. If the same rate of drain continued in the second-half of 1948, halfof this remaining amount would be gone by the end of the year.91. The rate of further exhaustion of the reserves in 1949 cannot beestimated very precisely. It must turn not only on the speed in developingexport markets in the Western Hemisphere and new sources of supply else-where, but also on the future course of import and export prices. At the lowest rate of drain that we might hope to achieve on the basis of current consumption of imports, the reserves would be exhausted during 1949.92. This is clearly a situation which cannot be contemplated. If it wereto become clear that we must act on the assumption that Marshall Aid will notbe available to us, we should be obliged to make further heavy cuts in our import programmes from the Western Hemisphere.93. Great reductions have already been made in Western Hemispherefood imports; we should, nevertheless, be forced to seek further reductions.Apart from raw materials, our other expenditures are comparatively smalland have been heavily cut.94. It is on raw materials from dollar sources that any further substantialcuts would have to fall. Already the greatest practicable amount is beingbought from non-dollar sources; a very small further shift could be madeat the expense of considerable price increases. Any sufficient cut of dollarraw materials would mean abandoning the basis on which the raw materialimport programme has been built: a sufficiency to maintain a high level ofemployment.95. Such further reductions would be most damaging in their social andeconomic effects and would diminish greatly the support which the UnitedKingdom could give to European reconstruction. They should not thereforebe made until they are shown to be absolutely inescapable.96. Far from aiding the recovery of Europe, we should be forced to take measures which might seriously retard it. We should be obliged to restrictour imports of less essential commodities; to divert our exports of coal, steel and other key materials to countries outside Europe, where they would con-tribute more to our immediate necessities; to refuse in any circumstances togrant credits, however. necessary to the long-run recovery of others, even where they might in the long run help our own.(g) The Balance on Capital Account97. It is clear from Table X that our gold and dollar reserves have fallenduring 1947 to a significantly greater extent than the deficit in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s over-all balance of payments.98. Table XI shows the estimated balance of payments both on current account and capital account, taken together, with the outside world.Table XI
(h) The Longer Run Problems of the Balance of Payments99. If we look beyond 1948 there are, as in the present, two aspects ofthe balance of payments that must be distinguished: the problem of the over-all balance and the problem of the Western Hemisphere.100. The over-all problem is that of finding a sufficient volume of exportswhich we can continue to sell year-in and year-out at prices which willcommand a market and at the same time bring in a total of receipts sufficientto meet our needs.101. To. cover the import programmes of 1948 wholly by exports wouldrequire, on the basis of the import and export prices of the first half of 1948,about 145 per cent, in volume of 1938 exports. That would imply, what is reasonably realistic, that our invisible earnings will be sufficient, and no morethan sufficient, to meet our invisible outgoings.102. To cover the 1938 imports we should need, on similar assumptions,about 190 per cent, of the 1938 exports.103. The revised export target of 150 per cent, of the 1938 volume, ifmaintained over a year, would afford an over-all balance, again on the sameassumptions, with a level of imports about  100 million higher than theannual rate of the first half of 1948.104. How far we can succeed in raising exports to an extent which willenable us consistently to provide adequate food and materials for a high level of employment can only be shown by experience. It would seem likely,however, that the restoration of a satisfactory over-all balance must requirenot only the expansion of our exports to a level very far above 1938, butalso some contraction of our imports below the level of that year.105. The problem of the Western Hemisphere deficit is far more difficultto solve. Even in the 1930&apos;s the achievement of a balance between the sterling Area and the Western Hemisphere was not easy. As nearly as canbe estimated, the United Kingdom had a deficit with the Western Hemispherein 1938 of about  110 million and the rest of the present Sterling Area hada further deficit of about  20 million. Against this could be set about 115 million of newly-mined gold, most of which ultimately reached theUnited States.106. In 1938 the United Kingdom had a substantial surplus (of the orderof  120 million) with the rest of the present Sterling Area and a substantialdeficit (of the order of  80 million) with the rest of the world, outside boththe Western Hemisphere and the Sterling Area. With the world as a whole the United Kingdom had a deficit of about  70 million.107. But even in 1938 the deficits of the United Kingdom with the western hemisphere and with the rest of the world outside the Sterling Area wouldnot appear to have been entirely offset by triangular trade movements. Therest of the Sterling Area was in surplus only to the extent of some  25 million,with the rest of the world, even after allowing for the value of newly-minedgold, and the circle would appear to have been closed by a net capital transferinto the Sterling Area as a whole from the Western Hemisphere and the restof the world of the order of  70 million.108. The calculations cannot be precise, but they suggest that a restorationof the pattern of the late 1930&apos;s would not give a balance between the sterling area and the Western Hemisphere unless the flow of long-term capital invest-ment were also restored.109. Moreover, the decline in the value in terms of goods of the new goldproduction of the Sterling Area has greatly diminished the efficacy of this very important element in the pre-war balance. In 1938 the newly-minedgold of the Sterling Area could pay for about one-third of the Sterling Area&apos;imports from the Western Hemisphere. By 1946, partly because of a decline of gold output, but principally because the price of gold had remained fixedwhile all other prices rose, the purchasing power of the newly-mined goldwas only about one-third of what it had been in 1938.110. But even if borrowings or capital repayments as well as triangulartrade movements helped in the 1930&apos;s to give us the over-all balance thatwe needed, the convertibility of all the currencies in the world into sterling and into dollars was fundamental. The restoration of a balance with theWestern Hemisphere would require immense and most painful changes of thewhole pattern of world trade, which could only be accomplished over a long period of time, if it were necessary to achieve it without the aid of triangulartrade and the convertibility of other currencies into dollars.   It would be
equally difficult without a re-establishment of the long-term capital movementswhich characterised both the second half of the nineteenth century and thefirst four decades of this.in. It is impossible for the moment to measure accurately the scale ofthe changes in the long-term pattern of our imports and exports which mustbe brought about before we can hope to restore a balance with the western hemisphere. It depends largely on the volume and direction of any futureoutflow of long-term capital investment from the United States. But it isplain that some considerable readjustment will be necessary and that the sterling Area must find not only increased means of paying the western hemisphere, but also alternative sources of supply for some of the products which it is not likely to be able to afford to buy from the western hemisphere.112. The broad strategy of external recovery must therefore be two-fold.First, we must make as rapid progress as is required towards an over-allbalance of payments. Second, we must achieve as quickly as possible asatisfactory means of paying the Western Hemisphere countries for our purchases from them.113. The export targets designed to raise the rate of exports to 150 percent, of 1938 by end-1948 represent the first objective of this long-term policy.But they form only one part of it. They must be seen in relation to theother parts of the policy.114. The second element of the policy is the saving of imports by increased supplies from home sources. The most important aspect of this is the large-scale plan set in motion last autumn to develop home agriculture. Otherimport-saving projects are being pushed ahead wherever they are expected tobe economically justifiable, and have been given specially favourable treatment in respect of new capital construction.115. These two elements of the policy are directed to secure an over-allbalance of payments. But we must at the same time secure a balance withthe Western Hemisphere. A third aim must, therefore, be to do all possibleto expand production and sales of those things for which we can make a market in the United States, Canada or the Argentine and other hard currencymarkets, even at the expense of exports to some of the countries from which our needs are less urgent.116. The fourth aim must be to create new sources of supply of our imports in countries to which we can, more easily make payments. The developmentboth of the Dominions, through a co-ordinated Commonwealth policy, andalso of the Colonial territories, in the interest both of the Colonial peoplesthemselves and of this and other consuming countries, thus becomes of greatimportance. The Government has already embarked on large-scale and concerted plans to this end.117. Fifth, the other Sterling Area countries are being invited to exercisesimilar measures of economy in the use of dollars, and to stimulate exportsto dollar-earning destinations. In many cases formal or informal agreement has been reached as to the limits of the calls that they will make on the reserves.118. Finally, it is the Governments aim in collaboration with other coun-tries, to restore a condition of world trade in which British exports can be expanded without undue restrictions and in which it is again possible to con-vert the earnings of exports&apos;to our customary markets into the means of payingour customary sources of supply.119. Within this broad strategy there is one issue of great importance: Howfast is it proper to aim to approach an over-all balance of payments if a deficit with the Western Hemisphere must continue? If we try to arriveat an over-all balance while we are still running a large adverse balance withthe Western Hemisphere, we must obviously be aiming at a correspondinglylarge surplus with the rest of the world. Should we try to eliminate this sur-plus of exports over imports (frequently referred to as &quot; unrequited &quot; exports)or does it serve some useful purpose?120. In general, it is intended to limit the volume of &quot; unrequited &quot; exports.It is certainly not the intention to permit the sterling balances built up duringthe war years to be drawn down at a rate that is incommensurate with thepresent resources of the United Kingdom. Limits on the reductions to bemade in such balances have been agreed formally or informally with a majorityof the countries that hold them.
69691 ig121. The prospective surplus in the first half of 1948 is not likely to be so large as to raise these problems in an acute form. There may be an over-alldeficit of  125 million and a surplus with the sterling area countries of theorder of  70 million. With the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the worldwe shall still be in deficit. These estimates are, however, subject to a con-siderable margin of error. It is not possible to predict with great accuracyeither the difference between total payments and receipts, or the distributionof exports between the sterling area and the rest of the world. Nor is itcertain that the sterling area countries will be able, in view of the agreementsmade with them, to buy so large a surplus as is here indicated.122. Apart from the difficulty of forecasting the countries with which weshall have a surplus and how large it will be, there are reasons why an excessof exports is sometimes desirable. Under a number of the agreement that have been made with other countries, the United Kingdom is under obligationto pay gold when these countries&apos; balances exceed an agreed maximum. since our gold and dollar reserves are our life-line, a small surplus of exports whichserves the purpose of reducing the dangers of making such payments is verymuch worth-while.123. If, again, we set ourselves to eliminate the whole surplus in our balanceof payments with any and every country, we should be turning our backon the commercial policy that we have so far pursued. We should be giving up our hopes of reviving multilateral trade and removing a powerful motiveto use and hold sterling. Moreover, part of the surplus represents the invest-ment which we have decided to make abroad to build up new supplies of primary produce, and so reduce our dollar imports.124. Even if our exports to countries in the sterling area are in excess ofwhat is needed to pay for essential imports or by way of investments, thesurplus is not necessarily wasted if the alternative is a higher dollar outlay bythe sterling area as a whole. If exports of cotton manufactures to Australia,for example, serve to allow Australia to dispense with imports from America,they are as effective in conserving dollars as direct exports from Britain to america.125. Apart from this, the paUern of our exports to the non-dollar worldshould correspond with the long-term pattern which we are trying to estab-lish for our export trade. An export trade cannot be re-de\doped overnight, nor can it be trimmed and redirected to suit every momentary shift of the wind of our commercial relations. It must be a matter of steadyand continuous redeployment of our resources to match the long-term demandslikely to be made upon us by old and new customers. If we greatly reduce our exports to certain markets this year, we cannot expect to be able to expand exports again to them next year.126. If our long-term policy is to restore pre-war sources of supply or buildup new sources of supply in those countries to which we arc in a positionto make payments, it is important that we do not simultaneously destroy the means to make payments to them. If we are asking them to use their resources to make exports to send to us, they must be reasonably assured of continuing supplies of goods from us.127. All these considerations justify a reasonable, but not excessive, surplusof exports to certain markets. The financial measures which the Governmentare taking to limit any excessive surplus take the form of agreements withother countries to limit repayment of debt, sterling credits, etc., to what isdesirable on general grounds, and agreements with other members:rs of the sterling area limiting the rate at which sterling balances will be drawn down.Other measures include pressure on industry to develop hard currencymarkets in preference to others, and special concentration in the export driveon the production of those types of goods that earn dollars; some limitation of exports of special value in the home market wherever those exports are mainly to non-dollar countries; a careful watch on export targets in case scarceconsumer goods or capital equipment are being exported excessively to countries that can only offer in return goods of less than equivalent real value.128. There are certain other aspects of our foreign trade policy which call for comment. We find ourselves during 1948 in a paradoxical situation. Weare gravely short of essentials, but almost plentifully endowed with someimports that meet less essential needs. For the moment the world outsidethe Western Hemisphere is short of food grains, coal, oil, steel, timber, sugar,meat and a number of other essentials. We are buying all of these things that we can from non-dollar sources. We cannot afford to buy as much aswe should wish from dollar sources, and in some cases, even the dollar supplies are limited. At the same time other European countries find themselves inthe same position as we do able to produce and anxious to exchange manu-factures or less essential foods which can satisfy only far less urgent needsthan the essentials which we and they cannot buy.129. In this situation our policy must be to maintain as high a level oftrade as we can without a net expenditure of gold or dollars. Any attempt on the part of European countries or of ourselves to confine international tradeto essentials is likely to have repercussions that will be disastrous all round.
6969I 20The international division of labour, which can provide a balance of payments for all countries at a high level of exchange of goods, may provide no satis-factory balance if all countries refuse imports of less-essentials when they areunable to import essentials. The United Kingdom, depending, as it does, solargely on the export of manufactures, would be one of the first to suffer.130. One aspect of this dilemma is likely to affect our import policies if in the course of 1948 our exports to some countries develop, as they almost certainly will, faster than our essential imports from them. It may thenbe advisable to permit, as a means of payment, some imports of less-essential goods which are consumed by all classes of the community. It may wellbe better to encourage the general expansion of world trade even in less-essentials than to allow an ultra-restrictionist policy to develop from the short supply of essentials.131. There is a further consequence of the break-down of convertibilitywhich calls for comment. International trade has, during the latter part of1947, become largely a matter of bilateral bargaining. The purchase of ournecessary imports is no longer a matter of finding the required supplies andearning the currencies to pay for them with the necessary volume of our traditional exports. Into the bilateral bargaining enter multitudinousconsiderations of the supplies of the key commodities which represent thechief bargaining counters, of the guaranteeing of prices and of deliveries,and of the use of import restrictions to direct trade into or out of particularchannels. These are the particular manifestations of scarcity andbargaining methods in a world in which prices and exchange rates no longermeasure the desirability of goods or currencies. But they serve toemphasise the immense importance of adequate supplies of coal, steel andother key bargaining counters.132. Such in very broad outline are the problems of our external balance.In the long run the recovery and expansion of the world economy, enablinglarge changes to be made in the present pattern of production and trade,must provide the solution. But our reserves, like those of many othercountries, are too small to permit us to wait upon events. The immediatenecessity is to find the means to maintain a high level of import of materials and a high level of internal activity. Only in this way can the UnitedKingdom put forth the continued economic vitality needed to sustain a risingstandard of living for the peoples of Europe and the British Commonwealth.
CHAPTER III.-CRITICAL SECTORS AT HOME133. The pattern of the United Kingdom economy in 1948 will be dictated by certain limiting factors. The extent to which we can by our own effortachieve the exports needed and yet maintain tolerable standards of con-sumption and capital development will depend not only on the direct exertionsof those who produce the goods for export, but also on the success of plans in some critical sectors of the home economy, which are more completelyunder our own control.134. Adequate supplies of coal and coke, electricity, gas, oil and steelare essential; inland transport must be able to carry the required trafficwithout delays. For reasons connected both with exports and home supplies,a large growth in the output of textiles is imperative and at least the founda-tion for further expansion in agriculture must be laid. All these are mattersof great urgency. But in none of them is the performance of our plans certain,and in several the plans are, perhaps inevitably, by no means commensurate with our needs. Some of these critical sectors are discussed below; they donot exhaust the possible dangers. As was made clear in paragraph 44, thereare a number of other limiting factors whvoh are holding up particular industries.(a) Coal135. Plans for the coal industry in 1948 must be directed to three mainends. First, we must ensure that our economic effort is not restricted by shortage of fuel. Second, we must greatly increase our exports of coal,to meet the pressing needs of our European neighbours, to obtain suppliesof scarce foods and raw materials from other countries short of fuel, and to earn foreign exchange urgently needed to balance our foreign payments.Third, we should provide some additional coal for household consumers.136. In 1947, thanks to the recovery of recruitment following nationalisationand the great efforts of the coal miners, the whole situation was transformed.Stocks were systematically built up during the summer of 1947 until they reached nearly 17 million tons at the end of November, and were still over16 million tons at the beginning of 1948, as compared with 8i million tons at the beginning of 1947. In addition to this large restoration of our distri-buted coal stocks, the National Coal Board was authorised at the end of1947 to begin exports of coal and bunker supplies on the scale of 200,000tons per week. All this gives reasonable ground for the expectation that weshall be able to achieve the above aims this year.137. This increase in stocks and revival of exports reflect both the marked improvement in coal production during 1947, and the fact that our home consumption has been held at a reasonable level. During 1946, our coaloutput was 190 million tons, of which 181.2 were deep-mined and 8.8 open-cast. In 1947, total output was 196.6 million tons (for the 52 weeks ended27th December), of which 186.4 were deep-mined and 10.2 open cast. Thereasons for this improvement are to be found in the better average output per man shift, which rose from 1.03 to 1.07 tons between 1946 and 1947,the increase in the labour force which rose from an average of 697,000 in1946 to an average of 712,000 in 1947, improved attendance, and theincrease in the total number of hours worked in the last quarter of 1947 asa result of the extension of hours agreement.138. It is essential that the favourable trends of 1947 should be continuedthis year. The objective must be to raise at least 200 million tons of coal from the mines and to produce at least 11 million tons of open-cast coal tomeet the target of 211 million for United Kingdom coal production in 1948which we gave at the Paris Conference on European Economic Co-operation in July last year. This 211 million tons must be regarded as a minimum task and every effort must be made to exceed it.139. It is planned to secure a substantial increase in output by various measures, of which the chief are: (1) An increase in the number of wage earners on colliery books to750,000 by the end of the year: this would mean an average labour force of 735,000 in 1948, as compared with 712,000 last year.(2) Continued mechanisation and re-equipment, of the coal mines: thescale on which this is being planned is indicated by the following figures: Mechanisation in United Kingdom Coal Mines, 1946-48EquipmentCoal Cutters        ........Conveyors (all types)Underground Haulage LocomotivesNew Machines Installed1946 19476771,0829002,400771948(planned)1,0004,000155
61(191 22(3) An increase in supplies of opsn-cast mining equipment: arrangements have been made to import from the United States excavators,tractors and other equipment, in order to increase output in 1948to 11 million tons, as compared with 10 million tons in 1947.(4) An extension of drift-mining: the National Coal Board has beguna rapid expansion of driftTinming operations, which within the nextfew years is expected to provide an annual output of 4 million tons.140. From this 211 million tons, we must find increased supplies forexport. We have already told the Paris Conference that we expect this year from this level of production to be able to provide 13 million tons for bunkersand exports comprising 6 million tons for bunkers at United Kingdom ports and 7 million tons for exports (the latter consisting of 6 million to the othercountries participating in the Conference, and 1 million tons for bunker depotsabroad). In addition, we must supply coal in substantial quantities to countries such as Canada and Argentina, urgently needing our coal and ableto send us in return supplies of food that we ourselves urgently need. Thismeans that we must increase the 13 million tons given at the Paris conference to at least 15 million tons for export and bunkers in 1948.141. Our minimum production target of 211 million tons and exports of 15million would leave us 196 million for inland consumption in 1948, as corn-pared with 184 million in 1947, when consumption was especially restricted by the fuel crisis. The first call on this extra tonnage will be the needs ofour enlarged steel output and industrial production, followed by the essential requirements of gas works and power stations, and the improvement of coal supplies to domestic consumers. The steel target of 14 million ingot tons for 1948 calls for an increase of between 3 and 4 million tons of coal, for theiron and steel industry and the coke ovens combined, over the amount theyactually consumed in 1947. We shall have to make sure that engineering and other industry get their full requirements to meet rising output. this may mean an additional demand of 2 million tons. At least 3 million tonswill probably be needed to meet increased demands by gas works and power stations. There might thus be left some 3-4 million tons to increase supplies for domestic users and all other classes of consumers, including transport providing always that the target of 211 million tons is reached. It must be emphasised that, in view of the foreign trade position and the necessity of meeting our commitments to export coal, any deficiency will have to fall on the household consumer.(b) Electricity142. Electricity presents two quite separate problems for our economy in1948. There is, first, the problem of generating capacity against rising peakdemand, and, second, the problem of total consumption with its claim on ourcoal supplies.143. The Problem of Generating Capacity Shortage. During the winter of 1946-47 the deficiency of generating capacity in the Grid required frequentload-shedding. The programme of new stations and extensions provides fora very large expansion in the next five years. But it takes about threeyears to manufacture and erect generating plant, so that capacity cannotcatch up the continuously rising trend of demand for some time. The onlysolution to this problem of insufficient generating capacity, now, and forthe next three years, is to reduce the demand at peak periods whether bystaggering the load or by other means.144. The present programme to expand electricity generating capacitymakes very heavy claims on steel, both for plant and buildings, and onproductive capacity in an industry with great opportunities for export. Itis by no means certain that it will be possible to adhere to the full programmeonce the most immediate shortages have been met.145. The possible deficiency for the national grid is shown in the followingestimates:  Table XIIElectricity Generating Capacity(Thousand Kilow atts sent out)Estimated Capacity Estimated Surplus orWinter *H                  available at Peak Peak Demand Deficit1947-48...       .....             9.530 10,950 - 1,4201948-49...       ..          -.           10.550 11,680 - 1,1301949-50...         ..       ...            12,000 12,450 - 4501950-51........            13.290 T3.24Q 4- 501951-52...       . .       ...           14.570 14,070 4- 5001952-53........-        15.7s&quot; &apos;4.s90 4- 890
146. The estimated peak capacity figures given in this table include thenew plant to be erected under the present programme, after the investmentcuts recentiy announced. Old plant has been included, and much of thisis now approaching the end of its useful life. The estimated peak demandfigures correspond to past trends. They assume the electricity demandsthat might exist with adequate coal deliveries to domestic consumers; theyassume, on the other hand, severe winter conditions and no staggering ofthe industrial load.147. In view of the loss to production which load-shedding inevitablyinvolves, special measures, including the staggering of working hours, havebeen taken. Industrial users are responsible for about one-half of the total annual electricity consumption, domestic users for one-third, and the rest is used mainly by transport, shops, offices and public lighting.148. Great efforts have been made by the Regional Boards for Industryto&apos; reduce the winter industrial peak load by one-third, and many scheme shave been brought into operation since 6th October, 1947. The sum of regional targets for load-spreading would yield a maximum reduction of1,781,000 kilowatts; an actual reduction of as much as 1,000,000 kilowatts has probably been secured.149. As the peak domestic demand occurs in much the same hours asthe peak industrial demand, it is equally important that this load shouldbe reduced or spread. Electricity supply undertakings have arranged where possible to cut off supplies to domestic consumers when load has to beshed, whilst maintaining supplies to industry, but there are technical limi-tations to the extent to which this can be done. Any method of load reduc-tion which involves the disconnection of feeders must be haphazard andundiscriminating, affecting more important and less important users alike.Apart from the limited achievements in this direction, appeals for voluntaryrestriction are the only means of restraint in use at present that apply to domestic consumers alone.150. The Claim on ow Coal Supplies. Apart from the problem of shortageof generating capacity, there is the second main problem mentioned inparagraph 142 above the drain on our coal supplies through unrestricteduse of electricity. The national electricity consumption rose by over 70 percent, between 1938 and 1947, and is expected by 1951 to be one-third greaterthan it is to-day. Coal used for generation has risen from 14.9 million tonsin 1938 to 27.1 million tons in 1947.(c) Oil151. The improved coal situation will also help to ease the effects ofincreasing world shortage of oil. Since the end of the war we have attempted to mitigate the effects of coal shortage in this country by conversion ofindustrial plant from coal to oil firing. Before the war, United Kingdominland consumption of oil fuel was less than i  million tons; by the endof 1947 it was running at an annual rate of about 3^ million tons, and new-conversion schemes due to come into operation during 1948 were planned to add a further increase of i  million tons a year. This projected increaseof approaching 4 million tons above pre-war fuel oil consumption is equiva-lent to a coal use of 6 to 8 million tons a year. The chief industries in whichoil firing has been applied are steel melting, glass manufacture and chemicals.152. Unfortunately oil is becoming increasingly scarce throughout theworld. This arises from the inevitable effects of the war and its aftermathin hindering the normal expansion of oil production, transport and refining,coupled with a startling increase in the world demand for oil products,especially in North America, during 1947. This increase is largely dueto conversion from coal to oil-burning equipment. Oil burning has increasednot only by industry but also in ships; the increase in bunker use has been particularly marked during the past year.153. The expansion in world demand for oil is shown in the followingtable: -Table XIIIWorld Oil ConsumptionConsumption of Petroleum Products(Million tons)  -Country                              &apos;93* J946United States        ............          &apos;47 234United Kingdom    .........    .  - -            11 &apos;british Commonwealth (excluding UnitedKingdom)    -      ............            &apos;4 &quot;U.S.S.R.

The limiting factors will be scrap availability, blast furnace capacity,fuel and transport. The supplies of limestone and refractories will also need to be watched carefully.162. Scrap. Stocks of scrap are being rapidly used up to maintain thecurrent high rates of steel production, and have fallen to little more than two weeks&apos; consumption. Stocks at the end of December amounted to375,000 tons compared with 616,000 tons at the beginning of the year.163. Scrap/ arisings jyithin the steel industry itself will increase with the increasing steel-output. Similarly, industrial arisings of scrap are related to the volume of steel consumed by the steel-making industries and should increase somewhat in 1948. Other scrap supplies from home sources are less predictable. War-time surpluses are rapidly dwmdling. During 1947home-bought scrap was coming forward at an annual rate of 3.6 million tons.Determined efforts will have to be made to seek out all possible sources of supply in the coming year.154. These figures show clearly the overwhelming importance of the UnitedStates, whose consumption has increased by over 70 per cent, since 1938.The American increase between 1946 and 1947 20 million tons is higherthan the total annual consumption in the United Kingdom.155. Large capital investment schemes for increasing the supply of British-controlled oil have already been prepared. They are designed eventually to double its output. These schemes cover not only the expansion of crude oil production, but also the erection of refineries both in this country and overseas. They will, however, take some years to mature, and may be delayed in view of the current shortage of steel. Nor is it possible to speedtheir completion to any large extent by the import of additional petroleumequipment from the United States. For not only dollars, but oil equipmentitself is short.156. A more immediate difficulty is to find the tanker tonnage needed for transporting oil currently available. The United States possess over50 per cent, of the world&apos;s tanker fleet, but their vessels are almost whollyengaged in meeting the vastly increased American oil requirements, andin maintaining their own overseas oil trade. The amount of United Statestanker tonnage currently available for charter by us is, therefore, negligible.The position is expected to improve as war-built tankers now laid up inUnited States yards are brought back into service during 1948. About 50of these tankers have already been acquired by British companies. At thesame time, United Kingdom tanker construction capacity is fully occupied, andtanker repair work has been given a very high priority in materials.157. These transport and supply difficulties have made it necessary to slow down the coal-to-oil conversion programme, so that the actual con-versions shall not run ahead of fuel oil supplies available. Radical improve-ment depends on the completion of our long-term plans for the expansion ofproduction and refining capacity. Meanwhile, there may be a period of veryconsiderable shortage and difficulty.(d) Steel158. Although a record rate of steel production was achieved in 1947,supplies of steel are likely to be a principal limiting factor throughout alarge part of British industry during 1948. This is due to the lack ofimports and the need to export.159. A target of 14 million tons of steel ingots and castings from home production has been set for 1948. This is within the physical capacity ofthe industry, and is attainable if, but only if, there is freedom from seriousfuel, raw material and transport difficulties. The recent high levels of output in excess of the target rate have been achieved in what is alwaysa good period of steel production and at the cost of continuous and ominousfalls in the stock levels of pig-iron, scrap and semi-finished steel. If theindustry is to produce 14 million ingot tons next year, it will be necessaryfor it to operate at certain periods of the year at levels substantially inexcess of that rate say 14^- or even 15 million tons.160. The main figures involved are summarised in the following table:--Table XIVSteel Output and Materials Consumed
164. Required imports of scrap for steel making are put at a minimum of 860,000 tons, but if more than this can be obtained, it could be used bythe industry and relieve pressure on pig-iron supplies. Before the war, oneof our main sources of supply was the United States, from which importsof scrap have touched the level of 1 million tons per annum. This source,however, has dried up. There is now no significant source of supply insight other than Germany. Negotiations are proceeding to secure up to1 million tons of scrap this year from this source. But they are not yetcompleted and the collection and transport of such a quantity will be a formidable task.165. Pig-iron. On the basis of 59 per cent, scrap usage, the pig-ironrequirement for steel making will be 7.1 million tons, to which a further2.1 million tons has to be added to meet the needs of the iron foundriesand the refined and wrought iron works. The needs of the iron castingsindustry are based on an estimated output of 3 million tons of irjn castingsin 1948, compared with a probable total of z\ million tons in 1047. Thisis likely to be the limit of achievement in 1948, when account is taken ofthe bottlenecks of labour supply, scrap and possibly of pig-iror itself. the combined demands for pig-iron for steel making and for the iron castingsindustry will tax to the full the whole of the blast furnace capacity includingthe additional furnaces that can be brought into blast in 1948.166. Iron Ore. The iron ore requirements show an increase of 1.7 million tons in home ore over the actual consumption in 1947, and an increase of1.3 million tons in imported ore. The total requirement of imported ore,including manganese ore, amounts to approximately 9 million tons, anamount which would tax the port handling facilities in this country to theutmost and will probably have to be met partly from stocks. Unlike scrapand pig-iron, stocks of ores are good. Stocks of imported ores amountedto 933,000 tons at the end of 1947 compared with 910,000 tons at the endof 1946.167. Fuel.-Requirements of coke for the iron and steel industry are esti-mated at \z\ million tons, all, except some 350,000 tons of gas coke forgeneral use and space heating, in the form of hard coke. It appears to be within the capacity of the coking industry to produce the additional suppliesneeded if all available ovens are pressed into service and adequate suppliesof coking coal are made available. But some limitation on other industrialusers and on domestic users of hard coke may be required.168. Transport__The cumulative effect of the movement ol the additional supplies of fuel, ore, pig-iron, semi-finished and finished steel will place avery heavy additional strain on the transport system. Demands for wagonsfor coal will compete with the transport of steel and steelmaking materials particularly in the case of hopper wagons. Sustained efforts will be requiredto overcome these difficulties by quicker repairs and reducing turn-round time.Some relief may be secured, despite the relatively high cost, by increasingthe use made of coasters in the shipping of pig-iron and semi-finished steel,particularly to South Wales.i6g. Labour__Shortages exist in some sections of the industry. Out-standing vacancies total about 11,000, about half in general iron foundries. Thewithdrawal of German prisoners for repatriation will aggravate these shortages in certain areas. Assistance will be obtained from more rapid release ofmen from the Forces. Nevertheless, special difficulties will be experienced in particular sections: the skilled blast-furnacemen needed to man the extrafurnaces to be brought into operation will, for example, be hard to findL^170. The Prospective Supply of Steel. From the preceding discussion^itwill be seen that the attainment of the 14 million ingot tons targetrfSr 1948is not assured. Though within the physical capacity of the industry, it couldbe placed in jeopardy by the failure to resolve the potential bottlenecks of scrap, pig-iron, coke and transport.171. In present conditions of unsatisfied demand, the central problem remains the provision of sufficient ingot and semi-finished steel to keep the availablefinishing capacity of the industry fully occupied. Finishing capacity is esti-mated at 16.75 million tons for 1948, so that, even if the target for home production of ingot were achieved, there would still remain a gap of 2.75 million ingot tons which could only be filled by imports.172. Unfortunately, great difficulties have been encountered in securingimports, and there is no prospect of our meeting our full needs. We mayget as little as 700,000 tons from all sources. Included in this figure is a sub-stantial tonnage from Belgium and Luxembourg, under a sliding scale agree-ment for exports to the United Kingdom in proportion to the levels of steel production in the supplying countries.173. For the purpose of planning the level of activity in the steel-using industries in 1948, it would be unwise to count on deliveries of finished steel from all sources home production, imports and recoveries of usable steel of
more than 2.6 million tons in the first quarter, rising to 2.7 million tons inthe second and third quarters and 2.8 million tons in the last. The average forthe last two quarters of 1947 has been a little over 2.5 million tons.174. The Demand for Steel. Even if we succeed in obtaining the suppliesof steel indicated in the last paragraph, they will be very far from adequate to our needs. The total available supply in the first quarter of 1948 will belittle, if at all, above that for the fourth quarter of 1947. The demands,however, have greatly increased.175. The new export targets require an increase of about 17 per cent, in engineering exports over those of the second half of 1947 by the end of 1948.Demands for direct exports of steel are increasingly clamant, and if we do not meet them we shall not secure the imports we want in bilateral bargaining. Thenew agricultural programme requires increased supplies of steel both foragricultural machinery and buildings. The needs of the coal mines, of thenew steel works and of the oil refineries are increasing.-176. All, or almost all, these increased demands must, for the time being,be balanced by cuts in other fields. Largely for this reason the building of very urgently needed new factories has had to be stopped. Vital repairs tothe railways have had to be postponed. Important oil developments havehad to go short of steel. The supplies of steel available to the gas industry willbe scarcely sufficient to provide for normal maintenance, and the allocations to shipbuilding cannot be materially increased.177. Difficulties of Particular Types of Steel. The prospective shortage ofsteel is even more apparent when regard is had to the position of particulartypes of steel within the total. There are likely to be in 1948, as in the past,special shortages of sheet steel, including electrical sheet, tin-plate, strip, lightplate and certain types of wire. These shortages, though influenced by specialfactors in certain cases, derive in the main from the inadequate supply ofbillets and semi-finished steel in relation to the available finishing capacity forthe lighter re-rolled products. In consequence the output of any one of thesetypes can be increased by diversion of billets and semis only at&apos;the expenseof accentuating the shortage of other types of re-rolled products in equallydifficult supply.178. In the case of light plate some relief will be afforded by the stabilisation-tion of the wagon programme for the home railways and by the slowing down of the oil-conversion schemes. As a result the difficiency may not be so serious as in the case of sheet. On the other hand, the easement afforded by the cur-tailment of factory building and other constructional work and by therestriction of rail supplies to the home railways will be felt in the heavierend of the rolling-mill capacity.179. Owing, to the limitations of the supply of slabs of the type and quality required by the continuous sheet mills, and of sheet bar for the handmills, the output of steel sheets in the first half of 1948 is unlikely to exceed320,000 tons a quarter compared with an average quarterly output of 310,000tons in 1947. For the same reasons the supply of tin-plate cannot be expectedto increase beyond the current quarterly rate of 180,000 tons, save at theexpense of sheet and other re-rolled products. The higher pre-war rates of output were achieved only by importing substantial quantities of sheet barsand slabs to fill the gap between the finishing capacity and the home produc-tion of this class of semi-manufactured steel. These imports are no longeravailable on the required scale.180. In the case of wire, there is a substantial lack of balance, due to the lack of the imports of rods that were normal before the war, between therod-rolling capacity of 650,000 tons a year and the wire-drawing capacityof 800,000 tons a year; but, quite apart from this unbalance between thetwo types of capacity, particular difficulties are likely to be experienced in finding enough 2-inch billets to fill even the available rod-rolling capacity.In certain classes of wire, shortages may prove to be more severe than forsheet, especially in the case of electrodes, stitching wire and cable wire.The varieties of wire are, however, so numerous and the use of each typeso widespread that it is impracticable to make any detailed forecast of theconsequences of the prospective shortages.181. Resort to substitutes and all-round economy may help to overcomesome of these problems, and indeed over the whole field of steels in particu-larly short supply there is a clear necessity to eliminate or strictly controlless essential usages and to strive for the maximum economy through speci-fications, design and the employment of alternative materials and methods offabrication.182. General Conclusions about Steel. Steel more than anything else willbe the limiting factor in 1948. Clearly there will be most acute difficultiesof control and allocation. But no system of control can make eight tonsdo the work of ten. We can and must make the greatest economy in theamount of steel used for any given purpose. When all possible economyhas been exercised, it is only by adjusting our purposes to our available resources that we can work out a balance between supply and demand.
(e) Inland Transport183. Railways. The end of the war found this country short of the railway facilities required for an expanding production. During the war, railway workshops were diverted to production more closely connected with the war effort; the older rolling-stock could not be replaced and remained in therailway service. The railways now have, therefore, a stock of locomotives,wagons and carriages, the average age of which is some years higher thanpre-war practice has shown to be prudent, and, as a consequence, there hasbeen an increase in the number of locomotives and wagons undergoing majorrepair and therefore not available for use. The overtaking of the arrears ofmaintenance and production will have to be gradual, in view especially ofthe steel shortage. Because of the more immediate importance of the loco-motives and wagons, these have been given precedence. The programme for carriage replacements will have to proceed more slowly. authority has been given for the production in 1948 of 600 locomotives, 48,000 wagons and 1,000 carriages. Plans have also been made to increase the rate ofwagon repairs.184. Nevertheless, the available stock of wagons was lower during the pastwinter than in the winter of 1946-47. In February, 1947, there was anoperating stock of 1,234,000 wagons, of which 139,000 were under repair, and1,095,000 available. By the end of December, 1947, the operating stock had fallen, through excess of scrapping over new building, to 1,218,000, of which only 1,058,000 were available for use. There were 160,000, or 13 per cent,of the total over three times the pre-war proportion under repair.185. Again, it was not possible during the war years to keep to pre-warstandards for the maintenance of the permanent way. In this case also it will be some years before the railways can catch up on their replacement of rails, sleepers and accessories. Before the war some 200,000 tons of railswere used annually in the maintenance of track. It would now be desirable,owing to the amount of deferred maintenance that accrued, to lay over300,000 tons a year for some years, but it will only be possible in 1948 toprovide some 250,000 tons. Safety will continue to make some reductionin the speed of trains necessary, and this in itself will accentuate the shortageof wagons.186. The railways thus face the present situation with a decrease in theiravailable resources. At the same time the demands on them have gone up. Although the actual tonnage of freight at present being carried isvery little changed from the weight in pre-war years, there has been a veryconsiderable increase in the ton-miles involved. The changes in our economic structure during the war have altered the distribution of industry; and, to getmaterials to feed essential production in times of shortage, it is often necessaryto move them greater distances. The average length of haul has increasedgreatly and the ton-miles carried ,each week during the twelve months to July, 1947, is 25 per cent, above the average for 1938. In particular,much of the coal that was formerly carried short distances and then exportedhas now to travel long distances within the country. The average length ofhaul of coal traffic has increased from 45 miles in 1938 to 57 miles in the twelve months to July, 1947.187. How far difficulties of inland transport will create a serious bottle-neck in production during the next year, it is not easy to forecast with certainty. The margin will, beyond doubt, be a narrow one.188. There are two dangers: first, that the available wagons will be in-sufficient to move the goods; second, that there will be difficulty in movingthe wagons to their destinations, so that the time of turn-round is lengthened.The outcome will depend primarily on improvements in the wagon repairposition and the turn-round time of wagons. But co-operation of industrialusers in minimising delays in loading and unloading is also essential. great and encouraging efforts have been made to improve the wagon situation.Week-end work by railwaymen and the assistance of volunteers have beeninvaluable; and during the present winter the turn-round of wagons has un-doubtedly improved and the seasonal decline in the number of wagons under repair has been more marked than usual. If this improvement can bemaintained and increased it may be possible to prevent any but temporarydislocation of rail transpprt.189. Risks remain and the effects of any substantial breakdown in rail transport might well be to cause breakdowns in the coal, steel and electricityprogrammes, with all the further repercussions which this would imply.But recent improvements have shown that continued unreniitting effort canreduce these risks to a very substantial extent.190. Road Transport. The production of public service passenger vehicleswas substantially reduced by the war and limited to a few austerity types.Since the war it has been substantially increased.

The most immediate need is to increase and re-deploy the labour force. In general, the cotton and woollen industries have more than sufficientmachinery for their present labour. Though maintenance and the provisionof certain types of new plant call for substantial expenditure, provisionfor this has been made in the investment programmes. Raw material &quot;&apos;stocks are high, and for the time being there are no great difficulties in -j, 3iW-oy *nMrt^acquiring the necessary additional supplies of materials.market reached an annual rate of about 8,000 at the end of 1947. The totalfleet of these vehicles is now about 60,000 compared with 52,000 before thewar. More&apos;than half are, however, over ten years old, and the numbers offthe road for repair are proportionately greater than before the war.191. These older vehicles make disproportionate demands on labour and materials to keep them on the road. The need to modernise the fleet is evident. But vehicles of this type are a valuable export, and the number to be supplied to the home market has to be limited. Production for the home market will be progressively reduced from the annual rate of 8,000 at theend of 1947 to a rate of 4,000 at the end of 1948. This will give a total ofabout 6,000 vehicles during the year.192. Output of goods vehicles was also reduced by the war, but since theend of the war has been considerably increased, and is now running abovethe pre-war level. There has also been an intake of ex-service vehicles.Substantial additions have, in consequence, been made to the national fleet.This stood at rather more than 500,000 vehicles in 1938. It fell to about450,000 in 1945. It has risen to 650,000 at the end of 1947. The effects ofthe war are still felt, however, in the average age and mechanical conditionof vehicles, particularly of the heavier classes.193. In present circumstances an. increased proportion of production forexport is necessary, and will entail no undue risk. The intake of new vehiclesinto the home market, which was at the rate of 100,000 a year at the end of1947, will be reduced to about 50,000 vehicles, of a total value of about 25 million, during 1948.(f) Textiles194. The textile industries in 1948 can make a conspicuous contributionto the nation&apos;s continued recovery. Expenditure on clothing is, after food,the largest component of domestic consumption and the most strictly limited by rationing. Textiles, especially cottons and worsteds, have ready buyersabroad in large quantities, and offer our largest opportunities of earningor saving dollars.195. The current basic ration level is 4 coupons per month; this is belowthe war-time level. Production of yarn and cloth recovered rapidly afterthe fuel crisis of last winter and in the summer months maintained a fairlysteady level somewhat above 1946. But increases of output of about 20 percent, in cotton and 12 per cent, in wool above summer levels are needed to meet both the export targets set last September and the present ration. 7196. Since the September targets were fixed, the shortage of steel, as wasexplained1 in paragraph 62, has required a considerable redaction in ourforecast of exports of vehicles, machinery and other metal goods. To offsetas much as possible of this loss, a detailed examination has recently beenmade of the possibility of increasing textile exports even beyond the Sep-tember target level for end-1948. It is believed that this could be done if the supplies could be made available. More fine worsteds and moreyarns and tops could probably be disposed of. Many more cotton goodscould certainly be sold. There is still a famine of such goods in the world.Moreover, textiles as a whole are particularly satisfactory exports at thepresent time. Not only have they good markets in the Western Hemisphere,- but their sale in countries in the sterling area, which are now importingheavily from the United States, directly reduces a pressure to import Americantextiles, and thus a call on the sterling area&apos;s dollar reserves. They arethe most important of &quot; inducement goods &quot; needed to call forth a high level of export production in- the Colonies and South-East Asia.197. The targets now proposed show the following increases in the volumeof textile exports between the second half of 1947 and the end of 1948:  Table XVPlanned Increases of Textile ExportsSecond Half of 1947 to End 1948
199. Both in cotton and wool marked increases in output can be obtainedfrom improved productivity through better deployment of labour and alevelling up of efficiency towards that achieved by the best firms, togetherwith increased hours. (Increased hours are already being worked in wool,but their application to some sections of the cotton industry is provingdifficult.)200. When every allowance is made for greater efficiency, a large increaseof numbers will also be necessary. The following table shows the numbers employed in September this year as a percentage of the corresponding figuresfor July 1939, and the percentage increases in the nine months january to September this year and the three months October to December:  Table XVIChanges in Numbers Employed		Per cent.

It will be seen that these industries are still well below their pre-warsize and are only returning towards it at a slow pace. The future maybe a little brighter. The first results of the new Control of Engagement Orderhave been encouraging, but it is doubtful whether the rate of improve-ment can be maintained. The recruitment of foreign labour, which hasalready brought 3,530 additional workers to cotton, and 2,000 to wool,has proved most useful. On the basis of present trends it is unlikely,however, that the total manpower in all textile industries would exceed725,000 (including 290,000 in cotton) at the end of 1948, as compared with652,000 (including 267,000 in cotton) at the end of 1947.202. Owing to the length of the period of production in textiles, thequantity available for export. at the end of 1948 will depend on the man-power of the industry in April next. On present indications, this willhardly be sufficient to maintain a four-coupon ration and achieve the end1948 increases of exports shown in paragraph 197.203. A labour force of 725,000 would still be 9 per cent, short of the1939 figure for textiles as a whole. In particular, 290,000 for the cottonindustry falls short by 16 per cent, of the 1939 labour force and by about25 per cent, of the labour force in 1937. Even if allowance be made forthe greatest practicable increase in productivity, this figure of 290,000 isnot high enough to enable the cotton industry to make a really satisfactorycontribution to national output, and in particular to the increase of exports.In order to allow exports to be increased to the limits of present opportunitieswithout any further reduction in the clothing ration a labour force of 760,000would be required, arid of this total 325,000 would be needed in the cottonindustry.204. A target of 760,000 including 325,000 in cotton, 200,000 in woollen and worsted and 235,000 in other textiles has, therefore, been fixed forthe end of 1948. The Government has already embarked on a large-scalecampaign, particularly in the cotton industry, to stimulate recruitment. Itis unlikely, however, that the high target figure of 325,000 for cotton canbe reached by this method alone. Further measures may be required to restrain the growth of other industries and services in the textile areas andto encourage the transfer of unused textile plant to other areas. The fulleffects of these and similar policies are, however, difficult to estimate at thisstage.(g) Agriculture205. Agricultural Programmes.- Home agriculture is a major factor inour hopes of a tolerable standard of diet in the years ahead, but it takestime to expand production, particularly to build up numbers of livestock;and even if the foundations are laid in 1948 relief from this source cannotbecome-significant until some time in 1949.206. The programme for the expansion of agricultural crop productionin the next four farm years (which run from June to May and include the harvest of the previous year&apos;s sowing), is shown in its present form in thefollowing Table:  
Table XVIIProduction of Prinicipal Agricultural Crops(000 tons)Product.

More than half of the net increase of production is expected to be derived from livestock, but, owing to the number of uncertain factors involved,it is much more difficult to estimate with precision the increases of thesefrom year to year. The goals for 1951-2, announced by the Minister ofAgriculture in August, 1947, when expressed as percentages of pre-war output,are as follows:  Table XVIIIObjectives for Livestock Products of 1951-21951-2as % of1936-9Milk      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       123EggsB^ef and Veal ...Mutton and LambPigmeat152no7792208. Saving of Imports__In terms of 1945-6 prices (home prices for finalproducts and import prices for imported feeding stuffs) this programme is designed to raise the net output of agriculture in 1951 above its 1946-47level by about 20 per cent., or about  100 million. In addition, it is hoped to expand the output of fisheries by about  16 million between 1946-7 and1951-52.209. The amount of the potential saving of food imports from this pro-gramme will depend upon how future import prices of food and feeding stuffscompare with the prices used in this measurement of net output. Thoughcurrent food import prices are considerably above 1945-6 home prices, theprices of imported feeding stuffs have risen still further, and there is momen-voluntarily less saving in foreign exchange than had been expected from the policyof producing more livestock products in the United Kingdom. This is, how-ever, a transient phenomenon and the long-term expansion policy rightlyassumes a more normal relation.210. The low crop production shown for 1947-8, as compared with 1946-7,is, of course, the result of weather conditions which have reduced bothacreages and yields. The effects of the drought and the shortage of feedingstuffs already experienced are serious enough to set a limit to livestock expan-sion during 1948-49, even given favourable conditions and the meeting of allfeed and other requirements.211. Feeding Stuffs__The shortage of feeding stuffs threatens however to cause some deferment in the execution of the livestock expansion programme.212. To maintain present cereal feeding scales for the existing livestockpopulation, with such additions as are already certain, coupon issues of cerealfeeding stuffs in the ration year ending September, 1948, must reach nearly2.700,000 tons. The supplies that are now being obtained from overseas willin part compensate for the reduction in home production of cereals for animal feeding arising from the poor harvest of 1947, and will also ensure the con-tinuance of existing ration scales until April, 1949.213. To cover the full livestock expansion programme, substantial additional supplies would be needed in the year May, 1948, to April, 1949, with further increases of supplies in subsequent years. It has recently been announcdthat existing ration scales can be maintained up to 30th April, 1949. Butthere is no assurance of sufficient long-term supplies to make possible a fullexpansion programme in 1948. Some expansion of livestock production will, however, become possible through the retention by farmers, for feedingto their own stock, of a proportion of their own wheat (or an equivalentsubstitute) and barley from the 1948 harvest.214. Manpower. The probable man-power requirements for the agricultural programme (excluding fishermen) are now assessed as 1,110,000 workers in1948 (mid and end) rising slowly to 1,170,000 in 1951. In mid 1947 thelabour force comprised 1,045,000 civilian workers (including some 6,000foreign workers, but excluding some 60,000 prisoners of war regarded as the equivalent of regular workers).
616^1 31By mid 1948, prisoner of war labour will no longer be available as such,but it is hoped to retain 18,000 ex-prisoners under civilian contract. The pre-sent plans also provide for the employment in all of 43,000 Poles and E.V.W.s(16,000 of whom were already at work in October). In addition to this 61,000foreign workers, the labour force would need to rise by 10,000 British workersin 1947-48, in order to achieve a total of 1,110,000 in 1948.215. During 1946-47 the number of British workers in agriculture was practically stable. But in the current year there may be some loss of regularwomen workers. As a result of the raising of the school leaving age therewill not be the usual intake of 15,000 juveniles. There are, moreover, anumber of obstacles to recruitment: housing and other accommodation is extremely short; agricultural employment is generally unattractive to urbanworkers; so are rural conditions and accommodation.216. Special efforts are being made to overcome these difficulties by theuse of labour controls, by publicity, and by tapping sources such  is labourmade available by restricting road work in rural areas. The Women&apos;s land army is being maintained at the highest practicable level, and conditions ofservice are being improved to make it more attractive. The need for assist-ance at the height of the season by temporary workers will be even greaterthis year in view of the larger acreages, especially of potatoes, to be planted.Arrangements are being made to ensure that such assistance is forthcoming from the Armed Forces, week-end volunteers, unemployed workers and school-boys and girls. Steps are also being taken to provide the maximum possibleamount of hostel accommodation.        1217. Agricultural Machinery. The Agricultural machinery programme pro-vides for the supply to the home m?!market of machinery to the value of morethan  40 million per annum in 1947-48 and until at least 1950-51. imports are scheduled to make only a small contribution to this supply. Manu-facturers are being encouraged to produce special types of machinery thatare still in very short supply. The export programme (as drawn up for the marshall Plan) requires, in addition, agricultural machinery exports of  18million in 1947-48 rising to  47 million in 1948-49 and  72 million in 1950-51.It is, however, unlikely that in 1948 we shall be able to allocate all the steel,more particularly of certain more scarce types, that is necessary to fulfilthis programme. It is also doubtful whether limitations of capacity, organi-sation and man-power will permit expansion at the speed required by theprogramme.218. Productivity and Investment__The original calculations on which thepresent agricultural programme is based assumed substantial increases in productivity per head, both through mechanisation and improved farmingproductivity. Activities of the Agricultural Executive Committees, theNational Land Service, and the National Agricultural Advisory Service are all largely devoted to this end.219. A large net investment of capital will be.required of farmers (after deducting depreciation on existing capital equipment and excluding the land-lord^ share of capital construction) under the programme, which over thewhole five year period might be in the region of  200 million. Full allowance for this outlay was made in the prices and other forms of assistance announced in August last. In addition, recoupment was given for known or expectedincreases in costs up to February, 1948, as well as some element of incentive.This was designed to provide an adequate stimulus for the adoption by farmers of the agricultural programme as a whole.220. During the war cropping directions were an important factor in the achievement of record output. It is now proposed to rely mainly on other means to achieve the objectives, and to enlist the active support of farmersfor the production programme as a national target. The response so far hasbeen encouraging, and it is particularly gratifying that farmers are realisingtheir responsibilities to the nation in securing a high output of potatoes fromthe forthcoming crop.221. General Conclusions on Agricultural Programme__To sum up; thefull livestock programme for 1948, as originally drawn up, cannot now be attained, although a start is being made. The fulfilment of the targets of arable cultivation, particularly potatoes, is even more urgently necessary, thanwhen they were first announced. While temporary difficulties may arise,supplies of labour and equipment should not prove an obstacle to the attain-ment of the desired expansion of production. Given a strong effort by the farming community, not only can the foundations be laid for substantial improvements in output in the latter part of the four year plan, but a significant increase can be secured in the fairly near future.
(h) Targets for 1948222. It has been decided to give concrete expression to the nation&apos;s industrialneeds in 1948, by setting targets for certain industries in which an increase of output, or the maintenance of output, is particularly important.223. The following targets have been set: Coal  Actual 1947 Target 1948Deep-mined output (52 weeks)         ...      ...           186-401. tons 200-0 m. tonsOpen-cast output (52 weeks).........            10-2 m. tons n-om. tonsMan-power on Colliery books (end-year)    ... 718,000 750,000Mining Machinery Coalcutters     ...      ... ... ... ... 1,172Power loaders   ...      ... ... ... ... 109Conveyors        ...      ... ... ... ... 2,666Tubs and cars (capacity) ... ... ... 56.390Iron and Steel Steel output (ingot)Sheet steel (!)   ...Electric sheet (*)Tinplate (&apos;)Iron castings    ......Shipbuilding Tankers completed12,724,000 tons1,285,000 tons94,000 tons648,000 tons2,781,000 tons1,4002504,70070,000 tons14,000,000 tons1,300,000 tons140,000 tons750,000 tons,000,000 tons120,000 g.r. tons     150,000 g.r. tonsRepairs : (target reductions) Railway   wagons   under   repair   (at   end-September)Electrical   generating   plant   under   repair(at end-year) ...Textiles Cotton yarn (2)End-year annual rateWorsted Yarn  ...End-year annual rateWoollen and worsted clothEnd-year annual rateRayon : continuous filament .End-year annual rateRayon : staple fibreEnd-year annual rateMan-power in cotton (end-year)Man-power in woollen and worsted (end-year)iyiti.ii-jjGwcr in other textiles (end-year)Agriculture Bread grainsOther grainsPotatoesSugar beet        .........       ......UnseedMan-power in agriculture (3) ...203,000475,000 k.w.170,000400,000 k.w.666 m.770 m.154 m-170 m.233 m.260 m.119 m.135 m.82 m.85 m.269,000179,000212,000lbs.lbs.lbs.lbs.yardsyardslbs.lbs.lbs.lbs.2,207,000 acres5,888,000 acres1,332,000 acres396,000 acres, 40,000 acres1,055,000950 m.1,092 m.190 m.204 m.290 m.300 m.150 m.165 m.105 m.120 m.325,000200,000235,0002,595,000 acres6,050,000 acres1,423,000 acres400,000 acres150,000 acres1,110,000lbs.lte.lbs.lbs.yardsyardslbs.lbs.lbs.lbs.(&apos;) Within the total of 14 million tons, the above targets of particular categories of outputhave been set; they may be varied in the course of the year, where necessary, tosecure a proper balance between different types.(2) Excluding spun rayon and mixture yarns.(3) The figure for 1947 is at end-year; the target for 1948 is required by mid-year.224. These targets may be added to from time to time, and attempts willbe made, where suitable, to get individual production units to set their owntargets in accordance with these overall figures.CHAPTER IV. CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT IN 1948225. The capital development programmes for 1948 were reviewed during september and October, 1947, and the White Paper (Cmd. 7268) subse-quently published set out the main objectives of the revision and the chiefelements in the programmes now proposed for 1948., 226. The exact total of the development plans that were being attempted,before the programme revision, by private industry and by public bodiesis not known since, over the large part of the field that is covered by private investment, the plans of the vast number of separate firms are constantlychanging both in magnitude and in timing and no statistical measurementof them has been attempted. It was, however, estimated that, apart fromthe cuts recently made, investment in building and fixed plant and equip-ment might actually have been carried out to the extent of some  1,600million during the year at 1947 prices. Apart from investment in fixed capitalsome allowance must be made for additions to stocks and work in progress.At prices of 1948, the total might have reached  2,000 million.227. A total gross capital investment of that size would have represented,about 18 per cent, of the estimated gross national product of 1948.   Thiswould not be an exceptionally large figure.   The gross investment of 1938was about 13^ per cent, of the gross national product of that year.   The grossinvestment of the United States in 1925-8 was about 29 per cent, of the
gross national product. It was about i8  per cent, in 1939. The plannedinvestment in France under the Monnet Plan would be about 25 per cent, andthat in the U.S.S.R. under the present Four-Year Plan about 22k per cent,of the respective gross products.228. The need for investment to catch up the war-time arrears of replace-ment and maintenance need scarcely be stressed. The annual wear and tearof capital requires at current costs of construction some  900 million of investment to make it good. The originally estimated net investment was not therefore large in relation to the accumulated arrears.229. The need to make cuts in the investment programmes springs from three things. First, the exhaustion of the dollar credits at an earlier datethan had been expected has made it necessary to build up exports more rapidly, even at the expense of postponement of advantageous re-equipment of the home industries. Second, the condition of achieving the necessaryexport targets is a release of certain materials, notably steel, which are in suchshort supply as to set an effective limit to production for export. Third, the over-all resources, including man-power, needed to build up the export and import-saving industries, can be secured only by reductions in investment aswell as consumption.230. There were two stages in the reduction of the investment programmes.First, it was necessary to cut back the total volume of manpower and materials that we were proposing to devote to investment. Second, it wasnecessary to bring the actual investment plans into better balance with theremaining resources. For it was plain that more was being started than could be achieved, so that energies were dissipated, productivity was reduced,periods of construction lengthened, and results were disproportionate to theefforts expended.231. The revisions of Departmental programmes involve the reduction ofthe estimated gross investment in fixed capital in the United Kingdom froman annual rate of about  1,550 million at mid-1947, and from the forecastrate of  1,600 million for the year 1948 to a rate of  1,320 million at theend of 1948 measured in each case at the prices of 1947. Since the end-1948rate can only be progressively approached during the course of the year,the forecast for the year as a whole is about  1,420 million.Table XIXEstimated Gross Investment in Fixed Capital in the United Kingdom		(  million at prices of 1947)			Mid-1947	Calendar year	End-1948	Calendar year	estimated	1948 original	estimated	1948 revised	annual rate	forecast	annual rate	forecastConstruction^)	850	825	700	770Plant,     Machinery     and				Vehicles  ...	610	680	525	555Shipbuilding   and   Miscel-				laneous   ...	90	95	95	95Total   ...	i.55o	1,600	1,320	1,420&apos;(*) The estimates for &quot; construction &quot; include, in addition to the output of the building and civil engineering industries, constructional work undertaken by employees of otherindustries, and the whole manufacturing cost of temporary houses.232. Thus the planned investment in fixed capital for 1948 is about  130million lower than the actual achievement at mid-1947 and about  180 millionlower than the originally estimated achievement of 1948. The end-1948 rateof investment is  280 million lower than the originally estimated annual rate.These represent, however, the reductions in the expected achievement. the cut-back of investment programmes, both private and public, which werebeing attempted, but which were in any case beyond our expected capacity to achieve, is far greater than this, but cannot at all precisely be measured.233. Within the total field of investment it has been sought to make the cuts selective and to concentrate the resources which can be made available on those projects which are most essential to the national economy. Becauseof its heavy use of steel, both for constructional work and for new plant, the cut has necessarily had to fail particularly heavily on industrial investment.The limited resources which can be made available in this field are being directed to those projects which will make the most substantial and earlycontribution to exports and the reduction of essential imports.234. Within the total of  1,420 million, therefore, the following principalobjectives have been set:  (a) Housing. It is planned to speed up the finishing of houses and toXrt., reduce the number of houses under construction from 250,000 to 140,000by the middle of 1949. The number of houses that can be completed in-v-t&quot; 1948 will be governed by the extent to which sites can be better mannedas the number of houses under construction is gradually reduced.    Atthe end of 1947 some 100,000 houses were roofed and awaiting completion.Special efforts are being made to hasten the completion of houses in coalmining and agricultural areas.
(b) Industrial Building__It is planned to concentrate work as much aspossible on the completion of factories which have already reached a com-paratively advanced stage. With this object in view, it was decided to suspendfor a period the starting of new projects. All projects which had not reachedthe steel-erection stage have been reviewed and a large proportion of them have been postponed.(c) Industrial Plant and Machinery. Detailed planning for the sectorscontrolled by private industry is not possible, but in fixing export quotas for plant and machinery account has been taken not only of prospective pro-duction but also the needs of the home industry. In the field of specialisedplant an increase from the rate of export of about  45 million per annum atthe end of 1947 to an annual rate of  72 million at the end of 1948 hasinvolved a reduction in the rate of supply to home industry from about  67million at the end of 1947 to  50 million at the end of 1948. It is moredifficult to assess the precise effects of higher export targets on the supplies to the home market of such general plant as pumps, motors and the like,Which are in many cases components of larger products. It is not proposedto exercise detailed control, but industry has been asked to postpone invest-ment which does not contribute quickly and significantly to export, import-saving, or the maintenance of the basic industries.(d) Electricity Supply. It is at present planned to maintain the existing programmes for plant and machinery of 1,150 megawatts in 1948 and 1,600megawatts in 1949, but to stabilise the programmes for 1950 and later years at 1,500 megawatts per year, instead of rising to 2,000 megawatts, the remain-ing plant production capacity being turned over to exports. On present fore-casts the position in 1950 and later years will be very much better than in1946 or 1947.(e) Petroleum-. The programmes for establishing oil refineries in thiscountry and for developing oil supplies overseas which, when completed, willmake possible a considerable saying of dollar expenditure, are being continued on a somewhat reduced scale after careful review of what is practicable and appropriate.(/) Coal. Investment to increase coal output is being raised to the highest level that is shown to be practicable and economic.(g) Railways. A construction programme for 1948 has been approvedcovering 600 locomotives, 48,000 wagons and 1,000 carriages; this involvessome reduction in the original programme of carriages, but no reductionin the programme of locomotives or wagons. In view of the present shortageof steel, the programme for permanent-way materials has been limited to250,000 tons of rails, and appropriate supplies of other materials and ofsleepers, which is sufficient to cover the current maintenance, but not tocontribute to the recovery of war-time arrears of maintenance.(fe) Iron and Steel. The present plans for new equipment to raise outputare vital to our economic recovery and are being maintained at the highest level that is practicable.(*) Agriculture. Provision has been made both for agricultural building work and for agricultural machinery on a substantially increased scale, esti-mated to be sufficient in the main to match the requirements of the Govern-menfs new agricultural programme.(7) Education. The educational building programmes had been designedto meet the following needs: (i) the places needed for raising the school-leaving age to 15; (ii) schools to meet new housing developments; (iii) themaintenance of existing primary or secondary schools (including provision to meet the rise in the birthrate); (iv) school meals; (v) further education,including technical education; (vi) teacher training; (vii) special schools forhandicapped children. It has now been decided to concentrate on the first three and to slow down work to a -greater or less extent in the remainingfields, with the exception of technical education which is being given firstclaim after the statutory obligations in the primary and secondary field havebeen covered.(ft) Health. The most urgent needs are for water and sewerage services,particularly for new housing areas. Work has been concentrated on thoseprojects, which cannot be safely postponed. Work on hospitals must be confined for the time being to a small amount of replacement of some ofthe many hospitals in the large towns that were destroyed by air attack.(I) Post Office. Investment is being maintained at the same level in1948 as in 1947, in order to release additional capacity for export. This willpreclude any substantial reduction of the present very large waiting list of telephone subscribers.235. These revised programmes will do little more than maintain the productive efficiency of the economic system. Within the total capital stock of the nation there will be improvements in some sectors which have sufferedseriously from lack of replacement or of modernisation, both during the
6i6gi-35war and in the years before the war, in coal and iron and steel in particular.There will be other sectors in which it will continue to be necessary to dependfor the time being on the existing capital equipment without full replacement of wear and tear. That is for the moment inevitable. But it is a process which cannot persist indefinitely. As the present emergency passes, it will beimperative to increase our productive capacity, particularly in some sectionsof the engineering industries, sufficiently to meet our own needs as well as toprovide the necessary volume of exports.236. The planned investment of  1,420 million refers only to investment in fixed plant, equipment and lbuildings and is at 1947 prices. In additionto this, some provision must be made for the increase during 1948 of stocks and industrial work in progress as output increases. The necessary figuredepends partly on expected changes of stocks of raw materials, partly on work in progress, partly on stocks both of export goods and goods for thehome market held by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, or, in the.case of exports, consigned but not yet paid for. For purposes of the national income calculations, allowance must be made for some small rise in costs.Thus the total claim of gross investment at home, both in fixed capital and in stocks, upon our resources during 1948 is put at  1,800 million. This representsabout 16 per cent, of the estimated gross national product.CHAPTER V.-MAN-POWER, NATIONAL income and CONSUMPTION237. In the preceding chapters separate sectors of the economy have been examined, and the main plans for 1948 have been considered. In the lightof these it is now possible to draw the broad picture of the national economy in terms of man-power and the national income.(a) The Distribution of Man-Power238. The total working population is likely to decline by 323,000 during1948. But recent decisions on the size of the Armed Forces imply that,despite this, the industrial population&apos; will increase during the year by 133,000.The detailed estimates, which make allowance for the raising of the school-leaving age, are as follows:  Table XXTotal Man-Power, 1947-48	(Thousands)					End-1946 (actual)	Mid-1947 (actual)	End-1947 (actual)	Mid-1948 (forecast)	End-1948 (forecast)Total working population   ...	20,413	20,357	20,423	20,210	20,100Strength of armed forces Ex-Service men and women on release leave	1.439 300	1,292 155	1,113 123	835 115	730 50Total industrial population Of whom Men ,,         Women	18,674 12,983 5.691	18,910 13.240 5.670	19,187 13,475 5.712	19,260 13,600 5,660	19,320 13.720 5,600It will be seen that the increase is entirely in the male labour force: thefemale industrial population is expected to fall.239. The total call on man-power of defence at the end of 1948 is likely tobe about 1,300,000. This includes the 730,000 in the Forces about 230,000non-industrial Civil Servants in the Defence Departments together with industrial staffs not directly engaged on production or research, and about350,000 workers in manufacturing industry employed either directly for theDefence Departments or on contract work for the Defence Departments. All,except the man-power in the Armed Forces, are included under the appropriateheadings in Table XXI.240. Labour is not at present, and is unlikely to be in 1948, the limiting factor in economic activity as a whole. Any projected distribution such as isgiven in Table XXI is therefore largely a forecast of the results of other determinants of the economy, and if some figures turn out differently it is not\ necessarily in every case a matter of regret. But certain of the individualfigures are targets in the full sense. They are numbers believed to be requiredto reach specific objectives in the set of output and export targets decided for1948. The attainment of these figures are among the first necessities in 1948.The figures in question are those for coalmining, agriculture and textiles; eachof which has already been discussed.241. Public Utilities__The figures for utilities and transport are fore-casts. These are, for the most part, attractive industries and though therestriction of investment will certainly restrain their expansion, it is unlikelythat it will prevent it altogether.
242. Public Services__The figure for public services shows a slight reduc-tion from the mid-1947 level. It is an aggregate which includes widelydivergent occupations the non-industrial Civil Service, some Governmentindustrial staffs not otherwise classified, the staffs of the Control commission for Germany, teachers employed by Local Authorities and the administrative and maintenance staffs of Local Authorities. It includes about 200,000 ofthe operating staff of the Post Office. It is doubtful whether anything in thedevelopment of public policy will lead to large reductions in these totals.There will be a large transfer from Friendly Societies to Ministry of national insurance staffs. There will also be a transfer of some 10,000 staff from theAgricultural Executive Committees (which were not included under this heading) to the Ministry of Agriculture. Economy in areas of acute labour shortage, and generally in the use of scarce skill and training, will be an objective.243. Distribution and Services__Much the same applies to the totals for distribution and other consumers&apos; services (commerce and finance, professional and personal service, entertainment, catering, laundries, &amp;c), where, also,only small changes are shown. It will be necessary to restrain growth insome sections of these rather heterogeneous totals in one or other of two ways: by the use of the new labour controls where this will contribute to the manning irp of essential industries, or by fiscal action to reduce inflationary pressure. In one sense, these are residual totals: the least useful 200,000,say, employed in these groups represent labour resources we should willinglyuse elsewhere if the materials were available for them.244. Manufactures. The manufacturing figures (except for textiles which,as has already been said, is a target) are again forecasts. The increases allowed for metals and engineering, chemicals and other manufacturing are all much smaller than could be wished. But present evidence suggests that suppliesof materials are unlikely to allow much expansion: the additions of materialsthat may be obtained are on a scale that can probably be easily absorbed by increased productivity. The labour problems in this field do not appear fromthe broad totals. They arise from internal shifts: the manning up of firms or departments engaged on priority work, the release of skilled labour frominessential work. In particular, efforts will be continued to increase the labour force in iron foundries, the tinplate industry, railway wagon manufacturing,and in the manufacture of ballbearings and other branches of the engineering industry where shortage of labour is at present holding back production. Inclothing and food, drink and tobacco, reductions are assumed for reasons ofmaterials. Part of the target expansion of textiles is likely in practice only tobe attainable at the expense of clothing, and cloth supplies, now considerably below recent levels, are most unlikely to rise. The pottery industry, althoughits labour force is equal to that of 1939, could make additional contributions to export if there were an increase in the labour force, as could the glassindustry, whose labour force is already well in excess of the pre-war figure.245. Building and Civil Engineering The total given for building and civil engineering requires separate comment. The industry has expandedrapidly and is now substantially ahead of the target laid down in the economic survey for 1947. It is already larger than present supplies of materials cansustain. The reduction of investment programmes, with the accompanyingcuts in building steel and timber, imply the need for contraction if labourwithin the industry is to be adequately occupied. The figure for the end of1948 is difficult to forecast, since maintenance work, using little materials,could certainly be expanded usefully and cannot be very closely controlled.The figure of 1,200,000 for the end of 1948 is consistent with the decisions on investment programmes.246. Unemploytnent. It will be seen that a figure for unemployment notablyhigher than the present level has been used. It is important to make clear what this implies. It does not imply any increase in long-term unemploymentor the emergence of any new &quot; depressed areas.&quot; The reduction of unem-ployment in the Development Areas which has been a welcome continuingfeature of recent months should go on. It allows for an increase in short-term unemployment, including possibly some temporary unemployment inthe building industry, resulting from the changing pattern of industry; for anincrease in transitional unemployment as a result of the internal changes inparticular industries which are required to implement export and essentialre-equipment programmes; and for some increase arising from a shortageof steel and other materials. There is also some likelihood of under-employ-ment during 1948 from similar causes.247. If imports of raw materials had to be severely cut on balance ofpayments grounds, unemployment might rise to a much higher level than wassuggested in the last paragraph. It was indicated in paragraph 14 above that a cut of 50 per cent, in our raw materials from dollar sources wouldinvolve a loss of about one-eighth of our total imports of materials.   Any

The preceding Chapters have set out the general limitations of our resources that will affect production in 1948. On the basis of these, it isnow possible to build up an estimate of the total national income and ex-penditure. From this we can judge whether the total of what we are attempt-ing is or is not within the limits of our Ipveralpresources, and whether any measures are necessary to limit some of the expenditure, and reduce it to abetter balance with the expected output from the available resources.250. But first a word of warning is necessary. Any estimate of a futurenational income must be built on a series of assumptions. It can have no greater validity than it derives from those assumptions, though the processof building it up enables numerous cross-checks to be made. Nor can esti-mates for the future be based always on accurate detailed knowledge of the&apos;results of the very recent past. These take time to collect and analyse. Thus,it is clear now that the figures previously published for 1946 somewhatunderestimated income and expenditure in that year and, pending a morethorough revision that will shortly be possible, a rough correction has beenmade here. Very little of even the preliminary material necessary for assessing the results of 1947 will become available until towards the end of the first quarter of 1948. In the meantime, many of the figures presented here for1947 are estimates that have hardly more validity than the forward estimates for 1948.  When in a few weeks the more careful estimates then possible forsuch loss would be bound to cause very considerable unemployment. thus the man-power distribution and the estimate of unemployment set out inTable XXI assume that raw materials can continue to be consumed on aboutthe present scale.248. General Conclusions regarding Man-Power. For the reasons that havebeen given, there is not one fixed distribution of man-power that it mustbe our objective to reach in 1948, though there are certain targets in certain industries which are of the very greatest importance. But policy cannotbe concerned only with the totals that are targets in the full sense of the term.Besides the special measures needed to get the mining or agricultural ortextile man-power, there have to be general measures to promote a greaterdegree of mobility, both to help the target recruitments, and to provide thatgeneral flexibility which the uncertainties of the situation demand. The factthat it is not possible to lay down precise man-power targets for large sectors of the economy does not imply that there are no general labour policies ofgreat importance that must be pursued in 1948. There are several, whichwill be briefly dealt with in Chapter VII below. Subject to these explana-tions, the following tentative budget of the industrial population for 1948may be given.Table XXI
1947 are published, there is no certainty that they will not differ considerably from the provisional estimates given here. This point must be emphasised: ifdecisions are to be made about 1948, they must be made on the basis of estimates which inevitably are uncertain and open to error, and into their use and interpretation an element of judgment necessarily enters.251. Iii forecasting the national income it has been assumed that the size anddistribution of the working population will be as given in Table XXI and thataverage hours of work will remain virtually unchanged from those rulingat the end of 1947 (despite increases in some essential industries). these assumptions would be falsified if it were necessary to make serious cuts, forthe reasons set above, in imports of raw materials. It has further been assumed that increases in productivity above present levels will be accom-panied by corresponding increases in money earnings.252. On the basis of these assumptions the national income of 1948 isestimated at about  9,000 million, as compared with  8,200 million in 1946and a very provisional figure of  8,600 million for 1947. These estimates areat the current prices of each year, and not at constant prices.Table XXIINational Resources and Expenditure, 1946-48(  million at current prices)RESOURCESEXPENDITURE	Provisional		194S Esti-mated		Provisional		1948 Esti-mated	1946	1947			1946	&apos;947	National income of the United Kingdom Borrowing from abroad etc.	8,200 380	8,600 675	9,000 250	Domestic  expendi-ture on goods and services, at market prices Personal Government ...

The total of resources available to cover home consumption, invest-ment and Government expenditure differs from the national income as definedabove to the extent to which we may be borrowing from abroad or lendingabroad. In recent years the total of expenditure at home has exceedednational income by considerable amounts, measuring the extent to which ithas been sustained by drawing on the United States and Canadian credits,less any net lending on our own part to other countries. In 1947 it is esti-mated that borrowing has contributed about  675 million to home expendi-ture, so that in all expenditure of  9,275 million has been possible.254. For 1948 it is the objective to reduce the over-all balance of pay-ments deficit and to limit expenditure to what is more nearly within ourshort-term and long-term means. If the adverse balance on current overseasaccount (which measures the extent of our foreign borrowing) is reduced to 250 million the total available for expenditure will ibe about  9,250 million in 1948, against the  9,275 million of 1947. Since the two estimates are notat constant prices, the difference of  25 million does not measure the changein the real resources available for home use between the two years. In veryround figures the fall may be of the order of 3 to 5 per cent.255. The effect either of a reduction of imports or of an increase of exports is to diminish the volume of goods available for consumption in thehome market. Thus a smaller adverse balance on current overseas account,very desirable as it is on other grounds, diminishes the flow of goods to be bought in relation to the flow of incomes to buy them, and is, therefore,inflationary in its effects. If the adverse balance is reduced, as is now ex-pected by some  425 million between 1947 and 1948, that is a factor to betaken into account, in measuring the inflationary pressure.256; The expenditure which must be met from the national income fall into three broad categories: personal expenditure on consumers&apos; goods and services; Government expenditure on consumers&apos; goods and services; the pro-vision of capital equipment for the future. There are several points that mustbe made about the measurement of these.
257- First, the calculation is concerned only with expenditures whichuse up man-power or other resources in their fulfilment: expenditures whichtake a sum of money from one group of people and give it to another group of people do not, as a rule, use up man-power and resources they aretransfers rather than claims on resources and they are excluded, save to theextent that they use resources to effect the transfer. But since such transfers(e.g., interest payments on Government debt) create incomes which are taxedthe total of taxable incomes is considerably greater than the figures given above.258. Second, the figure of  7,675 million shown as the personal expendi-ture in 1948 on goods and services represents the value of such goods and ser-vices as may be expected to be available to be bought, if supplies of materials and other limiting factors permit the available man-power to be employed as effectively as has been assumed. It assumes, that is, that the value of output reaches the estimated level, and represents the residue of this if theGovernment expenditure and the net capital formation are at the figures shownin Table XXII. It does not purport to represent the amount which in presentcircumstances consumers may wish to spend.259. Third, the figure of  2,050 million allowed for Government current expenditure is necessarily a somewhat uncertain provision, since the detailed estimates for the next financial year are not yet available at the time ofwriting. This provision covers not only Central Government but also LocalGovernment expenditure; it covers not only defence but also all expendi-ture by the Government (other than purely transfer payments) on social services, on education and other services provided by any public authority.Sums of money, such as unemployment insurance benefits and family allow-ances paid to individuals purely for the purpose of enabling them to meetpersonal expenditure and not in exchange for some further service, arealready included in the figure for personal expenditure and have, therefore,been excluded from Government expenditure.&apos; 260. Fourth, the figure for investment represents the net investment only.The gross expenditure on investment exceeds this by the allowance for depreciation, covering in ordinary times the wear and tear of producing thecurrent year&apos;s output. The payments for depreciation (estimated at  700million in 1948) are, however, already included in the prices of the goods and services and must not be counted a second time. But while net invest-ment measures the excess of the investment of the year 1948 over the depreciation allowances for the year, it does not imply an addition to ourpre-war stock of capital, but to our end-1947 stock. Any progress in 1948towards overtaking the war-time arrears of maintenance counts as netinvestment, even though the capital stock is considerably below the pre-war level. The figure for investment is based upon the planned capital investment set out in the recent White Paper (Cmd. 7268); it has been adjusted. to take account of the levels of wages and prices here assumedand to cover not only fixed capital but also additions to stocks and work inprogress (see paragraph 236).261. Fifth, the individual constituents of the three types of expendituredistinguished in Table XXII are measured at their market value; that is,they include indirect taxes paid by producers and sellers and exclude sub-subsidies paid to producers and sellers. Their total therefore necessarily exceeds the national income; this is the reason for the adjustment made on theexpenditure side of Table XXII. At the same time the individual figuresdo not measure the relative claims that they make on our national resources.A rough apportionment of indirect taxes and subsidies between the different types of expenditure suggests that of the  7,675 million included for personalexpenditure in 1948, about  1,450 million will be for payment of indirect taxes(less receipt of subsidies), as compared with  1,325 milkon in 1947. On these assumptions the distribution of our national income by types of expenditure would be roughly as below:  Table XXIIIUse of the National Income	1938	1947 Provisional	1948 EstimatedCurrent expenditure 	%	0/ /o	%Personal consumption	78	70	69Government current expenditure	16	24	22Additions to assets			Net capital formation at home (*)	7	14	12Less External disinvestment	- 1	- 8	- 2National Income ...	100	100	100(*) The increased proportion of net capital formation since 1938 is partly due to the methodof calculating depreciation (net capital formation is equal to gross capital formationless depreciation). The ratio of gross capital formation at home to gross national product was 13-4 per cent, in 1938, 17-8 per cent, in 1947 and is estimated to be16-o per cent, in 1948.

See note to Table XXII.(2) Including sums transferred to private capital account in settlement of war damageclaims and as post-war refunds of excess profits tax. These sums are estimated at about  150 million for 1948 as compared with ^300 million and ^280 million in 1946and 1947 respectively.264. It must be emphasised that the figures here, included are provisional.In particular, the figures given for the current expenditure of public authori-ties on goods and services and for the total tax revenue, which will be finally decided only in the course of the preparation of the next budget, donot represent forecasts of the outcome of the budget; they are no more thanindications of the orders of magnitude of the figures if present policies were continued. The contribution to net saving (the estimated surplus on currentaccounts of both central and local authorities) will need to be revised inaccordance with subsequent decisions on budgetary policy.265. The broad conclusion that flows from Table XXIV is that, on thebasis of these forecasts of the yield of taxes and of the probable government expenditure, taxation will withdraw purchasing power to a substantially greater extent than the various government outlays will put purchasing powerback into the hands of potential consumers. The extent of the excess of withdrawl the surplus on current account of public authorities as a whole is estimated at about  275 million on the basis of present tax-rates.267. In the same way Table XXV examines the question whether withoutinflation the purchasing power withdrawn by saving, in all its possible forms,will offset the creation of incomes by expenditure on the construction ofcapital equipment. The Table is a consolidation of all transactions on capital account, in which the various elements of saving including the surplus, of public authorities on current account, are set against the income created by grosscapital investment. Whether we have inflation in the economic system asa whole depends on how the necessary balance between saving and capital investment is achieved.268. The total of gross capital investment is made up of the investmentat home and the investment overseas. In recent years the investment over-seas has been negative: borrowing has provided us with imports which make possible a higher level of consumption and capital investment in this country&apos;than could be met without it. After allowing for such borrowing, the estimated total of home and overseas investment for 1948, at the assumed prices andafter allowing for additions to stocks is  1,550 million. To cover this an equivalent  1,550 million must be withheld. Towards this are to be reckonedthe estimated surplus of public authorities of  275 million. In addition, the 700 million of the year&apos;s depreciation allowance is properly reckoned againsta figure of gross investment.262. In order to see whether the amount which consumers may wish to spend is likely to be in reasonably close balance with the amount availableto be bought, that is, the figure of  7,675 million estimated above it isnecessary to examine more closely whether, by taxation and saving together,sufficient purchasing power is likely to be withheld from other expenditure to cover Government expenditure and capital formation. For it is evidentthat expenditure on these creates incomes that have no immediate counter-part in saleable goods or services.263. Table XXIV is a consolidated account of all public authorities,central and local. It excludes any payments from one public authority toanother which are merely transfers, and measures only the extent to which public authorities as a whole make or receive payments to or from the restof the community.
269. The total of these withdrawals amounts to  975 million. Thus tocover a total gross investment of  1,550 million, the community must beprepared to put aside in addition  575 million of purchasing power in theform of private saving.Table XXVCombined Capital Account, 1946-48(  million at current prices)SUMS SET ASIDE	Provisional		1948 Esti-mated	CAPITAL FORMATION	Provisional		194S Esti-mated	1946	1947			1946	&apos;947	Depreciation allowances Saving   of   public authorities (*) Private saving   ...	600 -410 780	650 -30 605	700 275 575	Gross capital forma-tion at home Less net borrowing abroad and sale of assets to foreigners	1.359 -380	1,900 -675	1,800 -250Total  sums  set aside	970	1,225	i,55o	Total   capital formation	970	1,225	I.550(&apos;) Before deduction of sums transferred to private capital accounts in settlement ofwar damage claims and as post-war refunds of excess profits tax. These sums are esti-mated at about ^150 million for 194S as compared with ^300 million and /280 million in1946 and 1947 respectively.270. It must, once again, be emphasised that all the above figures areestimates; that in several cases, particularly in that of the surplus on thepublic authority revenue accounts, they are obtained from relatively smalldifferences between large figures. The precise rate at which capital construc-tion at home will be reduced during 1948 Cannot be measured with accuracy.Again, the precise rate at which the adverse balance will be closed and foreignborrowing reduced is subject to substantial uncertainty.271. Moreover, if in the course of 1948 the broad assumptions of the fore-going calculations were falsified and shortages of raw materials precludedthe maintenance of the assumed levels of employment and output, the effect would be (as the result of social security payments) that the flow of goods for purchase in the home market would be contracted to a greater extent than the flow of incomes.272. Because of all these uncertainties, the figure of  575 million shownin Table XXV as the estimated volume of private saving needed to coverour planned home and overseas investment cannot be more than a best guessof the order of magnitude. The Table makes clear, however, the extent ofthe relief that we obtained by borrowing abroad in 1947; the effects of the investment cut; and the substantial contribution to saving that will be made,even on the existing basis, through lower Government outlay and increased taxation.273. The figure for private saving is a residual, remaining when allowance has been made for all these changes. It is not an estimate of the savings which private savers will wish to make. It is an estimate of the purchasingpower which private income receivers must voluntarily refrain from exer-cising if our home investment plans and our planned reduction of the scale of foreign borrowing are to be carried through with existing tax rates, andwithout raising prices and incomes above the current levels.274. If less than the necessary  575 million is voluntarily saved, and people attempt to spend more than the amount assumed in Table XXII on consumption, the economy as a whole will be subjected to inflationary pres-sure. The total demand for goods and services will exceed the available supply, and the demands of consumption will divert the resources needed to fulfil the capital development programmes and to reduce the adverse balance by making goods for export.275. It is true that rationing and other controls over supplies, prices andthe use of resources, limit the opportunities of increasing consumption injnany ways. But no system of economic controls can be wholly proof againststrong, and persistent inflationary pressure, working against the general objectives of economic policy.276. If the level of savings which people would choose of their own accord to make, falls far short of that required by the planned total of investment,the balance can be restored only in two ways or in a combination of the two.The capital development programmes or the export targets may fail to beachieved. Otherwise, prices and costs will be driven up. The real incomes of a large part of the nation will be reduced. Those who are in a positionto exploit the market will make abnormal profits. To the extent that theseare not spent within the year, savings will be increased. A balance willbe restored, but at inflated prices. The cost will be a strain on the workingof the economic controls, a partial failure of plans, and a burden on all those whose incomes lag behind prices.
277- ^ inflation is to be avoided, purchasing power to the extent of about 575 million must be voluntarily withheld. Not all of private saving needs,however, to be done by individuals. Additions to companies&apos; tax reserves and to undistributed profits provide a part. Table XXVI sets out the principalsources of saving and Table XXVII shows the proportion that savings have borne to personal disposable incomes in 1938 and in recent years.Table XXVISources of Private Savings(  million at current prices)Undistributed profitsChanges in tax reservesPersonal savings ...Total private saving(&apos;) The figure of ^605 million estimated to have been the total of private saving in1947, and the corresponding figure of 2J625 million estimated for personal saving inTable XXVII represent in part the effects of inflationary pressure (see paragraphs 276and 278).(a) The figures for 1948 show the required totals of private and personal savings, thelatter on the assumption that the other saving is at the rates shown.Table XXVIIPersonal Saving in relation to Personal Disposable Income(  million at current prices)1938	194G	1947	I948 ( St.)170	210	220	16	-155	-240	- IOO153	725	625	450(2)339	780	6o5(l)	575(2)Private income before tax ...

It will be seen from Table XXVII that, if the assumptions made about direct tax liabilities and undistributed profits are realised, the personalsaving required in 1948 will be appreciably less than actual saving in 1947.The high savings in 1946 and 1947 are however no guide to what saving wemay expect individuals to be prepared to make in 1948. The savings ofthese years were in part the outcome of the inflationary process described inparagraph 276, and in particular they were accompanied by a heavy strain on the economic controls. A more useful comparison is with 1938, wheninflationary pressure was not an important factor in increasing saving. the ratio of savings to personal disposable incomes would need to be more than half as great again as in 1938.279. Any estimate of voluntary net saving in 1948 in the absence of inflation can, thus, be no more than guesswork. Account must be taken of the desire of many persons to use their past savings to re-equip themselves with the durable consumption goods which are now coming on to the marketsomewhat more freely, but also of the use of past savings to maintainstandards of expenditure greater than present taxed incomes will permit.When allowance is made for these factors, which did not prevail to any likeextent in 1938, it is unlikely that, without a radical change in the willingness of individuals to save, .the total of net saving in 1948 in the absence of inflation-tion will reach the necessary figure.280. In these circumstances it will be seen how necessary it is to main-tain the drive for private saving in order that the necessary saving, or asnear as possible to it, may be reached apart from inflation. Since the circum-stances will in all probability be less favourable than in recent years, the effort will need to be all the greater. Whether or not some further with-drawal of purchasing power by other means may be necessary must dependnot only upon the success or failure of this voluntary saving, but also ondecisions that may be reached regarding expenditure by central and local governments.281. The limitations of these overall calculations of the possible inflationary pressure must be borne in mind. They measure the relation between the overall value of output which may be achieved and the overall total of incomes which may be created. Within the overall picture there are likelyto be considerable divergencies between areas and between products. If total demand does not exceed total supply, that will not necessarily mean that
G1691 43demand will not be excessive in some areas and deficient in others. Nor willit mean that demand will not be excessive for some products and deficientfor others. A balance between overall supply and overall demand will still leave particular problems and bottlenecks, and it may leave a general situationin which the pressure of demand, though not exceeding supply, tries to driveup prices and wages. An overall balance in this sense is not necessarily oreven probably a situation in which all the phenomena normally associatedwith inflation have completely disappeared, nor one in which all physicalcontrols could safely be removed.(c) Consumption in 1948282. It will naturally be asked what is likely to be the effect of the events and decisions of the past few months upon the standard of living of theUnited Kingdom in 1948.283. To that question, unfortunately, no certain or exact answer can begiven. The statistical pitfalls are numerous and the practical uncertaintiesare equally great. To name only a few of the latter, we cannot know at allprecisely how far shortages of materials will in the end preclude particularless-essential commodities for the home market from being produced. Wecannot accurately foretell how far workers displaced from industries in whichemployment will be reduced by material shortages will be quickly trans-ferred to other work so that ihey produce goods or services saleable in 1948.We cannot forecast very closely how far consumers, deprived of the goods thatthey would prefer to buy, will find other opportunities for consumption; ascompared with the pre-war years, one of the most familiar phenomena has beenthe growth of consumption of all sorts of services and entertainments which inmore normal Umes have a large margin of unused capacity.284. In Table XXII personal expenditure on consumers&apos; goods and services in 1948 was tentatively put at  7,675 million. This was on the assumptionthat the available resources and the purchasing power of consumers can be matched to each other. In the peculiar conditions of 1948 this may not bethe case: raw material shortages, difficulties of industrial mobility, shortages of industrial capacity may combine to leave resource; of manpower unom-ployed and, simultaneously, demand unsatisfied.-285. What this means in real terms, it is impossible to measure exactly.A revaluation of 1947 expenditure per head at 1938 prices gives a figureapproximately the same as the average amount spent on a quite differentcollection of goods and services in 1938. A revaluation of the 1948 total givenin Table XXII shows about the same result. It would be wholly misleadingto infer that the &quot; real &quot; standard of life has been, and will be, constant.For such a calculation takes no account of the loss which occurs when a cut in rations of food and clothing is accompanied by a rise in expenditure onthings less desired but more freely available. All that it suggests is that thefall in available resources in 1948 will be almost wholly offset by the plannedreductions in capital formation and Government expenditure.286. Food. For food and clothing, estimates must equally depend uponthe assumption that programmed imports will continue. Expenditure on foodis normally between a third and a quarter of all personal consumption.287. The effects upon home production of the winter of 1946-7 and of theserious drought in the summer will reduce the quantities of the basic food-stuffs available in 1948.

Translated into nutritional terms, the supplies shown in the tableabove would be equivalent to a daily intake as follows: Table XXIXFood Consumption in Great Britain(Daily Intake)Protein animal   gms. vegetable  ,, total ,,      ...............Fat (from all sources) gms.Visible fat (butter, margarine, lard, &amp;c, fat content)gms. .....................Total energy value (calories)289. The reduction in calories in the first half of 1948 (which is, of course,a broad average concealing differences in individual needs and consumption),is largely due to the lower average level of the meat and sugar ration andthe partial failure of the 1947 potato crop.290. Clothing. The main factors affecting the probable level of clothingsupplies have been discussed in paragraphs 194-204. The maintenance of thepresent four coupon monthly ration in 1948 must depend on the net resultof the pressure to raise exports and the campaigns to increase manpower and productivity. The export targets of textiles have been increased above thosefixed in September, 1947. If the manpower targets are not attained, andthere is no marked increase in productivity, a reduction in the ration willhave to be faced.291. Conclusions regarding Consumption. It is clear that if we may assume that present import programmes can be maintained, both in food and inclothing the real levels of consumption in 1948 will be appreciably, but notdisastrously, lower than in 1947. Thus, even if total expenditure at givenprices is not greatly reduced, the effective standard of living will be some-what reduced. In the field of clothing and other home-produced consumer goods, made from raw materials of which there is not a world shortage, wecan help ourselves by raising the productivity of our existing labour. Butin the case of food-stuffs where we are affected by world shortages and lackof suitable foreign exchange, we can only help ourselves to the rather more limited extent to which British agriculture is capable of quick expansion.292. If Marshall Aid were not available, this picture would be whollychanged. If heavy reductions of raw material imports had to foe imposed,as would be likely in the absence of Marshall Aid, and allocated in sucha way as to maintain our exports (which in those circumstances would becomevital to our existence), the reductions in supplies of many manufacturesto the home market would be very great, and standards of consumption in1948. would certainly be much lower than those of any of the war years.CHAPTER VI.-THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING plans for 1948293. The Needs of 1948. It remains to consider what changes in theeconomic pattern are involved in these policies and the means that we possessto make these changes, other than the general financial controls over totalexpenditure already discussed. We can only solve our problems in so faras they are understood and appreciated by the people, who must be preparedto co-operate in giving effect to the policies proposed.294. Our primary needs are to increase production in certain industries.The chief of these are coal, textiles, certain branches of engineering and agriculture.295. These increases require, first, that we shall provide the necessarymaterials and equipment; second, that there shall be a labour force sufficientto produce the necessary output, and, third, that we produce at the highest possible degree of efficiency, so as to get maximum production from existing resources at a cost low enough to ensure that we can sell our exports in theright markets.1296. The Problems of Raw Material Control__It will be of the first importance to secure that the available steel goes to the uses in which it can contribute most effectively to the building up of our exports and the main-tenance of our basic industries and services. To some extent this can beachieved by an efficient system of steel allocations and priorities. The systemof distributing steel has recently been revised to limit the use of priorities,while yet bringing into it the new requirements of agriculture and of exports&apos;.297. The extended use of priorities would be in danger of creating chaosin all except the industries that might momentarily foe benefiting. Prioritiesare appropriate to the immediate needs of a changing policy, but not to a
consistent policy. The greater the field covered the less effective is the priority.Their use will in future be confined within narrow limits and the relativeclaims of rival demands will be adjusted toy differences of allocations andnot by differences of priorities. Priorities will only be given to overcomespecific bottlenecks.298. Some further cut in certain steel-using programmes for the home market may become imperative, to meet the rising demands of other sectors.In the situation in which we find ourselves, with very limited material supplies and with the most urgent need to produce saleable exports, we mustbe assured that materials are provided to firms if, but only if, they caneffectively use them for absolutely essential purposes.299. How far some strengthening of our controls may be necessary will depend upon the extent of the willing collaboration of industry. The adjust-ments that have to be made in our industrial pattern and in the pattern of exports are great. If industry recognises the need of these adjustments andcollaborates in bringing them about, it may prove unnecessary to modify thepresent arrangements.300. All this pre-supposes that raw materials continue to be available onabout the present scale. If Marshall Aid were not in fact available and cutshad to be imposed on raw material imports a wholly new situation would arise. The limiting factor on employment throughout very large sections ofindustry, if not the whole of it, would be raw material supplies. It wouldbe imperative very greatly to strengthen the present administrative methodsof raw material allocation and distribution and to return to the full rigoursof the war-time controls. It would be necessary to solve problems of thedistribution of particular materials which did not arise in war, because pro-duction was mainly concentrated on munitions, and which it has never been necessary to solve in peace.301. Productivity__The required increases of production can be securedeither by employing more workers or by increasing output per head. Theemployment of more workers raises a number of problems of recruitment,training and housing to which reference will be made below. If the increasecan be obtained by increased productivity many of these problems can be averted. In the longer run, moreover, it is only by increased productivitythat we can recover our accustomed standards of life. The power to produce the exports which foreign countries wish to buy at the prices which will per-persuade them to buy is, moreover, a condition of our recovery. It is, therefore,imperative to do all that is possible to increase industrial efficiency.302. In the short run, however, it would not be safe to build exaggeratedhopes upon large and rapid increases in productivity. There are five mainsources of increased efficiency: increases and improvements in capital usedper head; increases of the supply of raw materials; increases in individualskill and effort; improvement of design so that less effort produces a givenresult; the re-deployment of labour and the removal of restrictions on its most efficient use. During 1948 there are relatively few industries in whichthe additions to or improvements in capital per head can make significantdifferences. In coal the first results of the re-organisation of pits will, indeed,begin to be apparent. But apart from the new factories in the development areas, there are relatively few other industries in which new equipment willbe coming into use on such a scale as to raise significantly the average outputof the whole country. The improvements in textile machinery, thoughimportant, form only a small proportion of the existing stock of looms andspindles and can therefore raise average output only a relatively small extent.In general the necessity to divert increased supplies of machinery to exportmust temporarily limit progress in this direction.303. In 1947 shortage of raw materials in relation to man-power has beena serious cause of loss of output. There can be little hope that the suppliesof materials that we can produce and buy in 1948 will permit a significantimproyejaerrt^riespite the recent cuts in capital expenditure. But while thisis trae^verally there are a number of industries in which the balance betweenman-pc?wer-and materials will now be much better.304. The necessary short-term improvement in productivity must comemainly from increased skill and effort, from measures which economise the effort needed to produce a given result, or from re-deployment of labour andremoval of restrictions.305. Where the necessary materials are available, a substantial increaseof individual effort is the best contribution to success in 1948 which can bemade by most men and women in industry. They will respond the more readily as they are brought to understand the full facts of the situation andthe measures which are necessary to meet it. To this end they must notonly be kept informed by statements and appeals on a national level; each industry, factory or group must be helped to appreciate its own part in thegeneral picture so that a country-wide sense of partnership in a vital commonenterprise may be developed.
307. Increased skill can be promoted by better facilities for technical training. Technical education, though hampered by accommodation, hasexpanded enormously in recent years. This year it is likely that there willbe an increase over 1947 of 30 per cent, in the number of students takingfull-time courses of professional training in technology and 15 per cent, inpart-time professional training for craftsmen and junior executives.308. The measures to reduce the effort necessary to produce a given resultare primarily the concern of research workers and management. Fundamentalresearch must be energetically pursued in order that industry may be estab-lished and maintained, on a fully competitive basis. This type of research,though of great potential importance to production in a few years&apos; time,cannot affect the pressing problems of the immediate future. Applied researchcan, however, make an immediate contribution to production problems. Thefullest use should be made of such resources as are available and opportunity should be taken to expand them.309. The recent appointment by the Government of the Advisory Councilon Scientific Policy, which is to act as a focus for research generally, symbolisesthe importance that is attached in present circumstances to scientific investi-gation for the benefit of industry. As regards industrial management, theBritish Institute of Management, the Production Efficiency Service and the fuel Efficiency Service are available to help the business community in raising the general level of competence. Government can assist further bypromoting the atmosphere and the organisation necessary for efforts withinindustry itself. The Industrial Working Parties represented a beginning.The Industrial Organisation and Development Act now being law, a start isbeing made with the setting up of the permanent Development Councils.There is evidence from the researches of such bodies as the Shirley Institutein the cotton industry that a great deal can be done to improve productivityby levelling up efficiency towards that already achieved by the best. Here,as in many other instances, the contributions of administration, regulation and exhortation from the centre are no more than first steps. Success dependsmost upon the energy and efficiency brought to the job in the offices and workshops of industry.310. Hours. Independently of the increase of output per man-hour, theoutput is also affected by the number of hours worked. Changes during 1947gave about five million work-people an average reduction of 3^ hours in thestandard working week, which is now 44 or 45 hours in most important industries. But in many industries in which there have been agreements toreduce standard working hours, the hours actually worked have not beenreduced, because of the shortage of man-power and the need to maintainproduction. A number of essential industries have, moreover, recentlyincreased their working hours in response to a Government request, wherethe supply of materials and power has permitted.311. In 1948 the importance of eliminating the bottlenecks in some ofthe primary and basic industries, and in transport services, will be so great that the Government will not hesitate to ask temporarily for additionaleffort wherever it is needed. It will confidently expect the same hearteningresponse as it received in 1947. .312. Almost equally important in the circumstances of 1948 are arrange-ments for staggering hours in winter months in order to avoid breakdownsof power supplies and the introduction of night shifts or double day shiftsworking to secure the full use of existing equipment.313. Labour Policy. When all possible has been done to increase pro-productivity, it will remain necessary to make substantial additions to the labourforces in a number of. industries. It was estimated above that increases of32,000 in coal-mining, 108,000 in textiles and 55,000 in agriculture should beregarded as targets. In the engineering industry, taken as a whole, anincrease of 24,000 is regarded as desirable; but this is likely to conceal largeinternal movements between different sections. There are other important,but less spectacular, increases that are desirable.314. Movement on this scale raises it need not be said very serious problems. The principal of these are the difficulties of the transfer of skilled men from industry to industry and the difficulties of accommodation wheregeographical as well as industrial mobility is involved. These difficulties are greatly enhanced when (as in the case of textiles) women rather than menare required.315. The measures already adopted to control engagements and guideworkers, where necessary, to essential work have succeeded in increasingsubstantially the net growth of the textile industries and of other under-manned industries. It is, however, unlikely that these measures, togetherwith the arrangements for introducing European workers, will alone suffice to solve the man-power problems.
322. The Survey in the preceding pages has been drawn up on the basis that the circumstances in the coming months will permit the carrying outof the policies now in force.323. In the present state of uncertainty about the European recovery programme and the development of the Western economies it is not possibleto prophesy or forecast what may actually happen during the year 1948. ,324. The year will no doubt be dominated by the decisions of theUnited States Congress on the grant of aid to Europe for reconstruction. It isclear from the above Survey that our present reliance upon supplies from theWestern Hemisphere makes it impossible for us to balance or even come near to a balance in our overseas trade in dollars and other hard currencies.325. However successful we may be in reaching our targets of exportsto such hard currency areas, and however far we may succeed in obtaining supplies from soft currency areas, we are bound to find ourselves at the endof the year with a heavy deficit of dollars or gold which will have to be made up from our reserves.326. If we were to allow this process to continue we should finally exhaustour reserves in 1949&quot;. If we were to attempt to correct to a further materialextent our dollar unbalance by the cutting off of yet more of our supplies from the Western Hemisphere we should not only create unemployment anddistress, but we should diminish our capacity to export and to help in the carrying through of European reconstruction.327. Our situation is therefore such that, without further substantial externalaid, we can have no hope of recovering equilibrium at a reasonable standardof life within the next few years.328. If that aid is offered on the scale indicated by the Paris Conferenceunder the Marshall Plan we shall still have to exert the utmost economy in our overseas expenditure. But it will obviate further damaging cuts in ourraw material and food purchases, which would progressively weaken our whole economy. It will also give us the time in which to carry through the longer-term measures which are essential for any permanent balance betweenthe economy of the Western Hemisphere and that of a co-operating western europe and British Commonwealth.329. If we are forced, in the absence of external aid, to balance our overseaspayments before our reserves are exhausted, we shall be obliged to make such drastic cuts in our dollar and gold purchases as will bring wholesaleunemployment, distress and dislocation of our production and will delay for years the prospect of a decent standard of living for our people.CHAPTER VII__CONCLUSIONS316. In the case of textiles, at least, where we have to deal with a highlylocalised industry, it is by no means certain that a solution can be foundwithout the imposition of limits on other forms of employment in the areas concerned.   It may even prove undesirable to attempt fully to man up the \industries in their traditional locations so that some dispersion to other areas \will be required. -- -317. But, however great the difficulties, they are perceptibly reduced ifpersons being guided into priority jobs are able to count on a pay packetnot lower than that to which they were accustomed and if the pull, increased in some cases by inflation, of competing less essential employment is reduced.318. The considerable changes in wages during and since the war, togetherwith substantial improvements in conditions of work, have done much toincrease the relative attractiveness of the undermanned industries, but thepull of some of the less essential industries which have had comparableincreases has not been wholly eliminated. It is of the utmost importance that the representatives of industry who determine these rates of wages andconditions of employment by their joint negotiation should take into account the urgent national needs and conduct their negotiations in such a way as toavoid competition between industries for labour by means of successive wage increases.319. Housing.-The most serious limit on transfer is set by accommodation.The planned increases in coal, agriculture and textiles all depend on theprovision of accommodation. It is hoped to concentrate on houses in coalmining districts during 1948. Not all of these can be made available for workers in the coal industry, though steps are being taken to see that thegreat majority of them are so available. Owing to the very reasonable claims of those already working in the industry, few are likely to come the wayof new recruits, but they will ease the general housing position in the mining areas.320. It is hoped also to concentrate upon houses in rural districts; againnot all will be available for agricultural workers, and still fewer for newrecruits to the industry. The planned increase will, however, make it easier to find lodgings or hostel accommodation for new workers.321. The housing programmes in the coal-mining and rural areas thus make an essential contribution to raising the labour force in these key industries.
133APPENDIX 1Fulfilment of the Objectives of the Economic Survey for 19471. This Appendix recapitulates the objectives set out in the economic survey for 1947, and examines the degree to which they have been fulfilled.2. The introduction to the Economic Survey for 1947 stressed the two over-riding limitations of economic planning in this country. Because the UnitedKingdom is a democratic country, the widest practicable degree of personalfreedom must be maintained and the use of compulsion to help execute theplan must be kept to a minimum acceptable to public opinion. Because theUnited Kingdom is a country dependent for existence on international trade,many of the factors governing its economic development are quite beyondthe effective influence of the planner, and wide deviations from even the plansmost recently drawn up are therefore unavoidable.3. Both these limitations were strikingly exemplified in 1947. On the onehand, a very wide measure of freedom prevailed both in the choice of occupa-tion and in the settlement of the comparative wages and conditions of differentoccupations. It has been the maintenance of so high a degree of freedom in both these respects taken together which has meant that neither the hoped-for distribution of manpower nor the production and export targets dependent upon that distribution could be fully achieved. On the other hand, great changes of policy have been forced on us by two world factors beyond our own control the violent rise in the world price of food and raw materials, the acuteincrease in the comparative degree of scarcity of different groups of currency in international finance.4. Balance of Payments. The 1947 import programme outlined in theEconomic Survey for 1947 provided for a volume of imports 80 85 percent, of the 1938 volume. In fact, however, a more severe limitation, primarilyof what \:re could afford in foreign exchange, but also partly in the early months of the year of the availability of supplies, compelled a restriction to only 74 per cent, of the 1938 volume. Nevertheless, because of the increasein prices, it is estimated that we have had to spend on imports some 9 percent, more than was budgeted for: Expenditure on Imports in 1947  million f.o.b.Programme   Provisionalin Survey       estimate for 1947Food and supplies for agriculture...       ...       ...       ...       ...        725 750Raw materials and supplies for industry ...       ...       ...        525 544Petroleum products ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 55 75Tobacco      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 50 33Machinery and equipment (including ships)      ...       ...       ... 60 \Consumer goods     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 35,1Totali.45o1.574330. But whether we receive such assistance or not, it is of cardinal impor-tance that we should maintain the highest level of exports that is possible.This depends not only upon our capacity to produce the goods but quite asmuch upon our ability to sell them in overseas markets, and particularly inthose from which we must draw the bulk of our imports.331. This ability to sell our goods will depend upon our being able to keepin check the inflationary tendencies in our economy and to produce at a cost which is competitive.332. For this reason it is essential that we should keep down the levelof individual money incomes amongst our own people. The importance ofthe recent statement upon this matter made by the Prime Minister cannot beoverstated, and in order to assure its wide circulation it is reproduced as an appendix to the Survey.333. The outlook for 1948 remains full of uncertainties and the coming year is bound to be one of great anxiety. But we can help to make 1948the first year of a great upward turn in European economic recovery. nothing in this Survey throws any doubt upon the ultimate capacity of our people to regain their economic strength and stability. Already our production exceedsthat of 1938, and each month recently has shown further upward progress.334. Great changes have been, and must continue to be, made in the pattern of our trade and in the lives of many of us. But these changes arethe signs of progress and are insignificant in relation to the underlying strengthof our people. They are small too when measured against the great changes that we made in the war years when, as now, our future was at stake.335. The response to the demands made by our present situation in thelast months of 1947 has been encouraging to the whole nation. If time canbe given us to bring about the necessary changes, there can be no doubtthat the great tasks of our economic recovery will be carried through with thesame energy and determination, and that they will prove to be within thecompass of our ability and capacity.

It was expected in the Survey for 1947 that the drain on our gold and dollar reserves would be greater than the overall deficit. In fact it has exceeded it by nearly half as much again, and the net drain on our reserves,allowing for drawings on I.M.F., was  963 million over the whole year.8. The target figure of  1,200 million for the proceeds of exports assumeda steady rate of expansion in the volume of exports throughout the year, upto a rate of&apos; 140 per cent, of the 1938 volume by the end of the year. Infact exports were reduced in the first half of the year, principally because ofthe fuel shortage, and only started to increase rapidly in the Summer. separately of 120 per cent, was reached by the end of the year, giving a total volume for the year of 108 per cent, of 1938 volume.9. Production. The steel targets were a total production of ingots andcastings not much below the 12J million tons attained in 1946, and a total supply (including imports) of finished steel for home consumption of notless than 9 million tons. On a 52 week basis total production of ingots andcastings was 12.534 million tons, and deliveries of finished steel for home consumption (on a 53 weeks basis) were just over 9 million tons.10. The coal target for 1947 was an output of 200 million tons. In the calendar year total production reached 196.6 million tons including 10.million tons opencast coal.11. Housing__The Economic Survey for 1947 set as a target the provisionof 240,000 new permanent houses and 60,000 temporary houses. The formerwas conditional on adequate supplies of materials; for that reason it had subsequently to be modified to the maximum degree of completion of thepermanent houses under construction at the beginning of April. In addition the bad weather in the early part of the year put back the programme some two to three months, so that the rate of building expected for the summer months was not in fact achieved till September. Since April 1st, 56 per cent,of those then under construction have been completed, and in the year as awhole 139,740 new permanent houses were completed. The target for tem-porary houses was also revised in April to one of producing 60,000 and oferecting 50,000 units. In fact, some 36,700 were produced during the year,but a total of 46,400 were erected.12. Manpower. The Economic Survey for 1947 set out a forecast ofthe likely changes in the size of the total manpower available for employ-ment, and a desirable pattern for redistribution of the available manpowerbetween different uses. The table below compares the changes, both in total supplies of manpower and in supplies for particular uses, as set out in theEconomic Survey for 1947, with those actually realised.5. The overall balance of payments is compared uvthe following table with what had been expected:

When the Economic Survey for 1947 was written, a fall in the totalworking population by 177,000 was feared. In the event the size of theworking population has increased by 9,000; it had been falling steadilyin the first nine months of the year, but the introduction of the Control of engagement Order resulted in a considerable recovery. (The economic survey had stressed the need for measures to bring into industry 100,000more workers than then seemed likely to be available. The sources suggestedwere foreign workers, retention of women and postponement of retirement:in the event, the number of foreign workers placed during 1947 was aloneabout 95,000.) The trend in the total working population over the year was thus 186,000 better than had been forecast. In addition, the numbers ofthe insured unemployed and of the demobilised not yet absorbed into civil employment together decreased by 77,000 more than had been forecast.14. Thus, the numbers available to meet requirements increased duringthe year, 1947, by 263,000 more than had been forecast. In addition,revisions of defence policy have reduced the requirement of the Armed forces by 70,000 more than the original defence plans had contemplated.15. This aggregate &quot; windfall &quot; of 333,000 in increased numbers in civilianoccupations has not permitted all industries to achieve the changes in man-power projected in the Economic Survey for 1947. Those occupations inwhich numbers increased more than foreshadowed in the Survey namely the manufacturing industries (other than building materials, textiles and clothing), distribution and consumers&apos; services, and public employment formed a group which increased their manpower in total by an additional399,000; leaving a shortfall of 66,000 which fell upon agriculture, coalmining,public utilities, textiles and clothing, and building materials production.16. The Economic Survey set a ceiling of manpower in distribution and consumers&apos; services which it was hoped would not be exceeded; in fact, ithas been overrun by 123,000. The Survey contemplated a reduction of numbers in public service; a small reduction of numbers in central Government service has been swamped by a rise in numbers in   local   government   service.

axe due largely to an increase in road passenger transport. The excess of numbers in the building industry is an excess over a figure representing thebuilding programme before it was reduced in April in the light of probablesupplies of materials. This excess is in striking contrast to the shortfall in numbers producing building materials. The remaining excess increases of manpower have been in metals and engineering and in miscellaneousmanufacturing. Some half of the excess manpower in the latter is attributable to increased numbers in the food and drink and tobacco industries, and in the printing and publishing industry, where, however, the expansion has notbeen in the undermanned sections.17. The outstanding deficiency in the trend of manpower distribution hasbeen the inadequate expansion in the coalmining labour force. The deficiency in textiles and clothing, though proportionately small, is also unsatisfactory.The increase contemplated in the Economic Survey for 1947 was veryconservative, and much of the realised increase has been in clothing, whichwas already adequately manned, and not in the undermanned textile industry.APPENDIX 2Statement on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices(Presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister, February 1948)1. The nation&apos;s economic welfare depends largely upon our ability to make and sell the exports necessary to buy the imports we need to feed our people and keep our industry going. Our costs of production are of vital importance and they depend to a considerable extent on the amount which industry hasto pay in profits, salaries and wages. These in turn in the form of individualincomes affect the total volume of money available in relation to the quantityof goods.2. As regards costs of production, it was pointed out in the &quot; Statement onthe Economic Consideration affecting relations between Employers and workers &quot; (Cmd. 7018) issued in January, 1947, with the endorsement of theNational Joint Advisory Council, that &quot; if costs of production and in conse-quence prices rise in relation to world prices, it may make it impossible forus to pay our way in the world and buy all the imports we need &apos;&apos;. We shallall suffer as a result and it is therefore the duty of everyone to play his or herpart in averting the danger.3. The Government have taken many steps already to prevent the develop-ment of a dangerous inflationary situation. High direct taxation on personal incomes and on distributed profits has curtailed the amount of profits availablefor spending and has thus helped to check the danger of inflation from personal incomes derived from investments, rents and profits. The same restraininginfluence has been applied to lower earned incomes by the introduction ofPAYE tax and by the increase of indirect taxation. This influence has tosome extent been countered by the continuance of Exchequer subsidies forcertain commodities, notably the principal foodstuffs, though it must be notedthat the subsidies have helped to keep down the cost of living and so thedemand for increased wages. But if personal incomes are allowed to risecontinuously none of these measures against inflation can be effective.4. The danger of inflation is ever present and will be accentuated by the drive to achieve a balance of payments, which will reduce the total volumeof goods available on the home market. Moreover, experience has shownthat, when it comes to a race between rising prices and personal incomes,prices will always win in the long run, so that conditions become progressivelyworse for the holders of all personal incomes but particularly for wage earners.5. It is essential, therefore, that there should be no further general increasein the level of personal incomes without at least a corresponding increase inthe volume of production. Unless we are prepared to check any such tendencywe shall find ourselves unable to fulfil our export task owing to the rise in costs, which will also be reflected in rising prices on the home market.6. The last hundred years have seen the growth of certain traditional orcustomary relationships between personal incomes including wages and salaries in different occupations. These have no necessary relevance to modern conditions. The relation which different personal incomes bear toone another must no longer be determined by this historical development ofthe past, but by the urgent needs of the present. In the changed world oftoday and with our present economic difficulties these old relationships of income must, where necessary, be adapted to conform to the national interest.Relative income levels must be such as to encourage the movement of labour to those industries where it is most needed, and should not, as in some cases they still do, tempt it in a contrary direction. 1
61091 527. The Government accordingly feel bound to set out the following general considerations as a guide to all those whose deliberations and actions contribute to the settlement of the amount of personal incomes, from whatever source.(a) It is not desirable for the Government to interfere directly with theincome of individuals otherwise than by taxation. To go further wouldmean that the Government would be forced itself to assess and regulateall personal incomes according to some scale which would have to bedetermined. This would be an incursion by the Government intowhat has hitherto been regarded as a field of free contract between individuals and organisations.(b) In the view of the Government it is essential that there should be the strictest adherence to the terms of collective agreements. One of themain advantages of a system of collective bargaining is that it tends to ensure that wage and salary movements take place in an orderly manner and with due regard to the general as distinct from theindividual interest. Departure from the agreed conditions by individual employers, whether public authorities or private concerns,will inevitably constitute a grave danger to the stability of the system of collective bargaining, and may well lead to competitive bargaining,and this to general but unjustifiable increases in wages and salaries and to serious inflation. The value of the system of collective bar-gaining and the justification for its maintenance at the present timerest upon the assumption that the terms of collective agreements willbe observed loyally by all employers and workers, and the government cannot stress too highly the importance which they attach to this principle.(c) In present conditions, and until more goods and services areavailable for the home market, there is no justification for any general increase of individual money incomes. Such an increase will merelyraise costs of production, without making more goods available, andso can only have an inflationary effect. Unless accompanied by asubstantial increase in production, it would drive up prices and charges,adversely affect pensioners, children and other recipients of social services benefits, increase the money cost of our exports and so reduce their saleability, and by Iblack market pressure make it almost impossible to operate the controls necessary in view of the continuingscarcity of supplies and man-power.(d) It does not follow that it would be right to stabilise all incomes asthey stand today. There may well be cases in which increases in wagesor salaries would be justified from a national point of view, for examplewhere it is essential in the national interest to man up a particularundermanned industry and it is clear that only an increase in wageswill attract the necessary labour. It does, however, follow that eachclaim for an increase in wages or salaries must be considered on its national merits and not on the basis of maintaining a former relativitybetween different occupations and industries.8. It will be observed from these principles that there is no justification atthe present time for any rise in incomes from profits, rent, or other like sources and that rises in wages or salaries should only be asked for and agreed upon in the exceptional cases mentioned above. On the other hand, if at some future time there should be a marked rise in the cost of living the level ofthose personal incomes which as a result became inadequate would needreconsideration.9. In order to avoid the undesirable necessity for any interference with theexisting methods of free negotiation and contract the Government must pressupon all those engaged in negotiations or decisions which might result in anincrease in wages or other personal incomes to keep these principles firmlybefore them, and not to depart from them. The Government will themselvesobserve these principles in any negotiations in which they are directly concerned.10. In these circumstances the Government have decided and wish it to be clearly understood that, if, notwithstanding these considerations, remunerationis increased in any class of employment, whether in private industry or undera public authority, there can be no presumption, whatever may have beenthe practice in the past, that the resulting costs will be taken into account in settling controlled prices, charges or margins or other financial mattersrequiring Government action. Each case will have to toe considered on its merits in relation to the principles enunciated above.11. To sum up, if general increases in profits, salaries or wages take place without more goods toeing made available, no-one can obtain any real benefitexcept the black market operator; the rest of the community has to endurethe dislocation and hardship which inevitably accompanies inflation. the alternatives now before us are therefore either a general agreement by thepeople to act together upon sound and public spirited lines or a serious and prolonged set-toack in our economic reconstruction accompanied by a persistentlow standard of living.
