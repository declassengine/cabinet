MKcJjLAffcC.....A&apos;..197BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SEC RET C.P. (48) 5818th February, 1948.CABINETSTATEMENT ON PERSONAL INCOMES. COSTS AND PRICES:ENQUIRIES RECEIVED BY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS UNDER PARAGRAPH 10Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn his paper CP. (48) 54 the Minister of Labour and national Service suggests that, where enquiries are received byany Department as to the interpretation in a particular case ofthe principles laid down in paragraph 10 of the White Paper on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices, no advance indication should begiven to either side in a wage negotiation of the view likely to betaken by the Government, but that they should be told to complete their negotiations in the light of their own judgment and onlythereafter will the Government decide to what extent,  if at all,any increase conceded can be reflected in prices.      I am bound tosay that this suggestion seems to me quite impracticable.2. Paragraph 10 of the White Paper says that there can be nopresumption that costs resulting from an increase in remunerationwill be taken into account in adjusting prices, subsidies etc.  over which the Government has control, but that each case will have tobe considered on its merits in relation to the principles set outin the White Paper.      This implies that, when it comes to deciding whether or not to increase prices or subsidies, the Government mustjudge whether a particular wage increase does or does not complywith the principles of the White Paper,  and in particular with thoseof paragraph 7(d).     We cannot therefore escape passing a judgment on particular wage claims.      It seems to me that we shall have the worst of both worlds and shall place ourselves in a quite untenableposition if we agree to make such judgments after the event, butrefuse to make them before it.      I do not see how I con say toan employers&apos; organisation which is faced with a wage claim that Ican express no opinion on the question whether or not the claim,if conceded, will be allowed to be reflected in prices, and thenif they decide to grant the claim, turn round and tell them thatit is plainly contrary to the principles of the &quot;White Paper andtherefore they can have no increase in prices.      The result wouldcertainly be that it would become the general practice to makeagreements to increase wages conditional on the Governmenfsagreeing to increase prices.      This has already happened in thecose of furniture and check trading.3. I am quite sure that we cannot&apos;and should not try to evade the responsibility which the White paper clearly involvesfor the Government, but should devise machinery for dealing withthese requests for guidance as they arise.     The question may beput to the Ministry of Labour whether a particular wage claim isor is not justified in accordance with the White Paper principles,COPY NO.-1-
or it may &quot;be put by the employers to the price-controllingDeportment in the form of a request for an indication howparagraph 10 will be applied.      In either case I suggest thatthe Departments concerned must consider together,  and beprepared to give the industry some&quot;guidance, whether or notthe claim is justified In&apos; accordance with the terms of theWhite Paper, and consequently whether the price-controllingDeportments ought to have regard in fixing prices to any concession that may be made*      The decision whether to increasethe price would not of course be made in advance;    it would bereached in accordance with the usual criteria and it does not follow that a price increase would be given.J.H.W.Board of Trade,  S.W.1,18th February, 19U8.
