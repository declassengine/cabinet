Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1948_______________________;   1SECRET Copy No.   30CP. (48) 57lQth February, 1948CABINETMACHINERY FOR FURTHERING THE PROJECT FOR A WESTERNUNIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should like to inform my colleagues of the machinery which exists,i particularly in the economic field, and of the use to which it can be puV inj   furthering the project for a Western Union.This machinery, which has been called into being by recent events, is describedi   briefly in the following paragraphs.I. International Machinery1. Much progress has been made in the last twelve months in Europe asfar as organisation for economic matters is concerned. The Economic commission for Europe, an organ of the United Nations, was launched in March 1947 andhas already constituted committees dealing with transport, coal, steel, timber,industry and materials generally, as well as sub-committees or working partiesdealing with electric power and lesser commodities like silica bricks. Whilethe membership of committee extends to the whole of Europe, the Paris Conferencedecided that certain functions (e.g., in relation to coal and timber) could most appropriately be referred to it, and there is not, in principle, any difficulty inthe Committee &apos;s performing certain functions in relation to the western european countries, though there may, of course, be difficulty in practice. Thework of the Commission has been largely confined so far to study and recommen-dation. Owing to its membership the effectiveness of the Commission mustultimately depend on the relationship between the East and the West andtherefore remains in doubt.2. Then there are the technical groups set up by the Paris Conference,which are still in being. They cover transport, coal, steel, food and agriculture,timber and financial matters. There is also a group concerned with balanceof payments questions. In addition, the Paris Conference set up two specialbodies on Customs Unions and Labour Questions; the former has had two meetings and the latter one.3. Lastly, and probably of greatest importance to the concept of western union, is the so-called joint or continuing organisation which the sixteencountries participating in the Economic-Recovery Programme are committed toestablish. Western Germany will be represented on this body. Its purpose willbe to supervise the execution of the European Recovery Programme, and the precise nature of its functions is still under discussion. But it is likely to acquireconsiderable authority and influence in matters of allocation, production and trading and in financial matters, and may become the most important instrument of progress towards economic union in Western Europe. Although on paperit need only co-exist with the European Recovery Programme and can therefore vcome to an end with the end of American aid, it is unlikely in fact to be temporary,and in view of its more limited membership and the practical tasks which itwill have to perform it is likely to be more effective than the Economic Commission34954
for Europe. It may also take under its umbrella the work of Customs unions and such questions as the rationalisation of the economy of European overseas territories, especially in Africa, through subordinate groups or sub-committees.(An example of possible action of&apos; this kind would be the continuation, underthe aegis of the continuing organisation and with the participation of belgium and Italy, of the intergovernmental discussions on co-operation on overseas terri-tories in Africa which are shortly to take place between the British and french governments.) \4. In all the circumstances it may be doubted whether additional machinery to further the project of Western Union in the economic sphere is needed.Indeed, any attempt to set up more exclusive committees or organisations underthe proposed treaties with the Benelux Powers would be likely to have a dis-disturbing effect on the remainder of the countries covered by the European recovery programme and threaten the collective spirit and feeling which has beenlaboriously and on the whole successfully nurtured. In practice, there already exist smaller groups within the sixteen countries by which much of the work is done, and on all of these France and Benelux are regularly represented.5. While therefore it will be found desirable to set up some form of com-mittee or consultative machinery between the parties to the proposed treaties inorder to implement them and the project of Western Union generally, 1 recom-mend that in economic matters reliance be in the main placed on the machinery which is now being constructed. And the parties to the treaties could, however,well declare their full support of this machinery and their intention to put their full weight behind it. At the same time, until we have had a full exchange of views, I cannot see clearly whether or not a more intimate type of machinery maybe needed to deal with more detailed and precise issues of integration.I therefore propose, while following the procedure outlined above, for themoment to keep an open mind on this further possibility, bearing in mind theimperative necessity of maintaining the wider machinery which is being estab-lished in connexion with the European Recovery Programme.6. As regards the political aspects of the Western Union project. I am,as my colleagues know, arranging a meeting of Foreign Ministers to be held in brussels as soon as general agreement has been reached on its programme of work through the diplomatic channel. This meeting will, I hope, set up some per-manent international machinery for furthering Western Union generally.II. National Machinery7.   Interdepartmental machinery for dealing with the problem of economic-co-operation is already in existence and working smoothly.8. The main committee is the inter-departmental Committee on european economic Co-operation, usually known as the London Committee (chairman,Mr. R. W. B. Clarke, Treasury). The terms of reference of this committee cover the European Recovery Programme and the work of the Eponomic Commission for europe. It has an executive or steering committee, which meets very frequently,and standing committees on Programmes (chairman, Mr. H. T. Weeks, CentralEconomic Planning Staff), Supply and Allocation (chairman, Mr. F. G. Lee,Ministry of Supply) and the Economic Commission for Europe (chairman,Mr. R. Stevens, Foreign Office). There is also an interdepartmental committeeon Customs Unions (chairman, Sir S. Caine, Colonial Office). Bilateral nego-tiations with European countries are handled by the Overseas NegotiationsCommittee (chairman, Mr. T. L. Rowan, Treasury) and questions of british exports to Europe are taken by the Exports Committee (chairman, Mr. J. R. C.Helmore, Board of Trade). The Secretariat for these committees is providedby a special section of the Cabinet Office, staffed in part by officials seconded fromthe Treasury, Foreign Office and Board of Trade.9.   The committees work closely together; there is considerable interlockingof membership; and it will be seen that the cares of office are spread fairly evenlyover the departments concerned.   In the Foreign Office itself I have now set up    \a separate department to deal with the economic aspects of European recovery.   *10. I consider that this machinery is adequate to deal with the economic implications of the Western Union project, and that it is not necessary to amplifyit for the time being.
s19411. In handling the political questions arising out of the Western Unionplan, I propose to keep the Cabinet informed of developments by means of a regular series of progress reports which I shall submit from time to time. in defence matters I -shall, of course, keep in touch, through the existing machinery,with the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff.III. Social Services12. It is my hope that closer union with Europe will cover a wider iieidthan economic and defence measures. Indeed, closer economic union will imply a considerable degree of similarity in social and political standards among thecountries which participate in it. One of the difficulties inherent in this conceptis the widely differing levels and efficiency of the social services in the UnitedKingdom and in Western European countries. I should like to have this problem examined and I suggest the establishment of a separate committee of officials from the departments principally concerned for this purpose.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,18th February, 1948.
