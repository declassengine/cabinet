(48) 19).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,28th January, 1948.FORTNIGHTLY ECONOMIC report . Man-powerEmployment in manufacturing industries increased in November and reached its highest level since the end of the war. The numbers employed on directexport orders rose to 1-9 million. There was a corresponding drop in thoseworking on orders for the home market but the number is still higher than beforethe war (Table 1).2. More people are now being employed in the &quot; under-manned industries &quot;(Table 2). Employment in cotton spinning and weaving rose in November to267,000; this total is still one-fifth less than before the war. There was a further increase in the numbers working in other branches of the textile industries but,as Table 2 shows, the number employed in iron foundries is still less than beforethe war.Foreign workers. 98,225 foreign workers have been placed in employment in this country by the end of 1947 (Table 3). 27,738 have gone into agriculture, and 10,739into textiles. 8,239 have been placed in employment in coal mining but this number of foreign workers is only slightly more than 1 per cent, of the. totalon the colliery books. (Belgian and French coal mines are now employing evenlarger numbers of foreign workers than they did before the war. More thanone-third of the total employed in Belgian coal mines in September 1947 wereforeign workers or prisoners of war.)Unemployment4. The number of insured persons registered as unemployed in GreatBritain rose slightly between November and December and on 8th December was277,000. More than half of these had been unemployed for less than 8 weeks and a quarter for less than 2 weeks. The number of unemployed in the Develop-ment Areas has declined since 1946 more rapidly than the total for the restof the country.34862 b

Production ;Coal5. Production of deep-mined coal rose to 4 million tons in the second week of January but declined to 3 - 94 million tons in the following week. (Thiswas 6 -1 per cent, higher than the corresponding week of- last year.) output per man-snif t so far in January has been less than in November and December.Production of deep-mined coal-	Production			Output per man shift overall			1947-48 Th. tons	1946-47 Th. tons	Percentage change	1947-48 Tons	1946-47 Tons	Increase tonsNovember (weekly-average)	4,044	3,735	-1- 8-3	1-12	1-06	-f-0 06December Christmas week New Year week	2,528 3,047	2,275 3,085	+ 11-1 - 1-2	1 03 1-04	0-95 1-03	+0-08 +0-01January 1st week 2nd week 3rd week	3,942 4,013 3,935	3,780 3,745 3,710	-1- 4-3 : -1- 7-1 -1- 6-1	109 110	1-07 1-07 107	+0-02 -f-0-03. 6., The rate of output of opencast coal is still less than in the last threemonths, of 1947.Textiles * ,..7. Output of textiles is increasing but is still too low to meet the needsof the ekport markets and of home consumers. The latest figures of output ofcotton, yarn show a recovery after the holidays, but they are still much less than before the war. Output of rayon and staple fibre on the other hand is now well above pre-war level.Textile Production	Cotton yarn	Rayon yarn and staple fibre &apos;	Woven cotton and, rayon fabrics -	Worsted yarn	Woven wool fabrics	Mn. lbs.^)	Mn. lbs.(2)	Mn. linear .    yds.0   .

Iron and Steel8. Output of steel ingots and castings recovered quickly after the holidays.In the week ended 10th January, 266,000 tons were produced only slightly lessthan the high level attained before Christmas.9. Stocks of pig iron and scrap have risen slightly during recent weeks butare still low. Larger supplies will be needed if the high rate of steel output needed in 1948 is to be achieved.   (Table 5.) . -    . ...Coal mining machinery10. Deliveries of coal cutters and conveyors to the National Coal board were larger in December, while exports were maintained. Production of collierytubs and mining cars, all for home use, has fallen since October.   (Table 6.)House Building11. The number of houses completed in December was the highest, sincethe war. The number under contract but not yet started is now falling month by month and the number under construction has now fallen for two months.(Table 7.)III.-Food12. Complete figures for the year 1947 show that consumption of potatoeshas almost doubled since before the war and that there has been a substantial risein consumption of flour. Consumption of meat and bacon and rationed fats was much below pre-war levels.Human consumption of certain foods in the United Kingdom	Potatoes		Flour		Meat and bacon		Rationed fats		Per		Per		Per	Per	Th. tons	cent.

Balance of Payments13. The rate of drain on our gold and dollar reserves during the first threeweeks of January has been higher than in December. There have been largepayments of gold and dollars to Belgium, Egypt and India in recent weeks. sales of United States dollars to Canada have also been heavy, partly because of restric-tions on the rate at which we can draw on outstanding Canadian credits.The Drain on Reserves1947-i...

At the end of the year wholesale prices were still rising.The Boardof Trade index of wholesale &quot;prices for December was 201 (1938 = 100), comparedwith 177 in December 1946 a rise of 13 per cent, over the year. Prices of indus-trial raw materials increased by 15 per cent, in 1947.34862 B 2
Retail Prices &apos;15. Mainly because of the food subsidies the United Kingdom is one of the few countries in the world in which retail prices of food since the war have risenless than the average of all retail prices. In the United States retail food prices are almost double their pre-war level while the average of all retail prices is only60 per cent, greater.Index Numbers of Cost of Living(1937=100) -Country	1947	All items	Food onlyUnited Kingdom   ...
