4LuUet*.i  V n      (5  &amp; - o Z . a/7]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET. Copy No.        K cp. (45) 318.4 A December, 1945.CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.IN the debate on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, thoughboth the Progressive-Conservative and C.C.F. parties moved amendments to the address, each voted with the Government on the amendment of the other party,and the resolution was adopted by a substantial majority. The first test of theGovernment&apos;s strength came, however, on the question of agricultural farm prices.Both the Progressive-Conservative and C.C.F. parties moved amendments, theformer advocating that farm prices should not fall below 90 per cent, of parity,and the latter calling for full parity prices. On each amendment the two Opposi-tion parties voted together, and the Government was only sustained by a vote of116 to 91 in one case and 117 to 90 in the other. These figures may be taken asan indication of the Governments strength in the present House.2. The Budget, the War Appropriations Bill, and the Navy, Army andAir Force estimates have all come before the House. The first of these Bills to beintroduced by the Minister of Finance, Mr. Ilsley, was the War AppropriationsBill, calling for a vote of $ 1,365 million for defence and demobilisation. Appro-appropriations for the current fiscal year are, $3,365 million, of which an interimappropriation of $2,000 million was voted at the last session of Parliament.In the debates on the estimates services both Mr. Abbott, the Minister of NationalDefence, and Mr. Gibson Minister for Air, stressed the fact that Canada wouldbe called upon to maintain a rather larger peace-time force than she had beforethe war. In the debate which followed, the Opposition parties readily agreedthat Canada should plan for an adequate peace-time force.3. A Bill to enable Canada to become a signatory of the Constitution estab-lishing the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations was passed on the 13th October, two days before the F.A.O. Conference opened in Quebec.The National Emergency Powers Act was introduced in the House on the5th October by the Minister of Justice to take the place of the War MeasuresAct. This Measure gives the Government the right in peace-time to take quickand effective action in case of a. national emergency, and is effective for one yearunless Parliament itself votes to extend this period.4. The subject of an increase in pay for members of the House of Commonshas also been raised. The proposal calls for an increase of $2,000 over theirpresent indemnity of $4,000. There has, perhaps not unnaturally, been some criticism from the Senate, for whose members no increase has been suggested. Theproposal seems likely to be adopted, but has given rise to some criticism on thegrounds that, while the merits of the case are recognised, the present moment,when efforts are being made to maintain the general wage-level, is hardly appro-priate for the change.[30984] B
5. Two important Conferences in connection with Civil Aviation were heldin Montreal during October. On the 15th October the second session of the interim Council of P.I.C.A. opened with delegates of 17 nations of the 20 membersof the Interim Council present. The purpose of the meeting was to attemptto set forth the broad outlines of an International Aviation Convention.6. The International Air Transport Association opened its first annualgeneral meeting on the 16th October. More than 100 delegates from 24 nationsrepresenting 57 air-lines were present. The largest national group was fromthe United States with 35 representatives from 15 air-lines. Provision was madefor nine regional traffic conferences of the association to deal with air trafficmatters, cargo and mail, and the establishment of branch offices in a number ofcities was authorised.7. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation was formallyestablished on the 16th October at Quebec, when representatives of 30 countriessigned the constitution. Russia was not among the 30 original delegates whosigned, but has since signified her intention to do so. The 7 United nations who did not attend the Hot Springs Conference were invited to send observers,and all but Turkey and Saudi Arabia accepted the invitation. Mr. L. B. Pearson.Canadian Ambassador at Washington, was appointed Chairman of theConference.8. At the meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions early inOctober, Canada was given a place on the Executive Committee. Canada&apos;sstand during the Conference was in favour of more power being placed in thehands of the middle and small Powers. The Executive was later broadened togive the smaller nations increased influence. Mr. Conroy, Secretary-Treasurerof the Canadian Congress of Labour, who was the Dominion representative atthe Conference, protested, however, that Canada&apos;s representation was inadequate,since she was accorded one vote only, compared with three or four granted to some small Powers.9. Mr. John D. Kearney, former High Commissioner for Canada in Dublinhas been appointed the first Canadian Minister to Norway. Mr. Merchant M.Mahoney, C.B.E., Counsellor at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, has beenappointed Canadian High Commissioner in his place.10. Dr. Mariano Caballero, first Minister of Cuba to Canada, recently arrived to take up his duties in Ottawa.11. In Manitoba the Coalition Government was returned to power at theGeneral Election, with a large majority, securing 43 seats as against the Opposi-tion 12. Mr. S. S. Garson, the Premier, and all the members of his Cabinet were returned. Eight of the Opposition seats have been won by C.C.F. candidates, whothus increase their membership in the House by 5.12. In British Columbia the Election has resulted in an increased majorityfor the Coalition Government of Liberals and Progressives. The Coalitionsecured 35 seats, the Opposition 13.13. In Nova Scotia Election, the Liberals gained an overwhelming victory,winning 28 out of the 30 seats.  The remaining 2 seats are held by the Socialists.Economic.14. The Minister for Finance forecast a budgetary deficit for the year of$2,250 million, expenditure being estimated at $4,650 million (including$53,600 million for war and demobilisation) and revenues at $2,415 million. Inaddition to ordinary expenditures the budget is to provide a sum of about$800 million for the provision of credits to Allied countries to aid in financingtheir needs and promoting Canadian export trade; this sum brings the total finan-cial requirements for the current fiscal year up to a round total of $5,400 million.In connection with this latter figure Mr. Howe pointed out, in the course of the debate on the appropriation, that the amount provided for loans to Allies wouldbe a cash and not a budgetary requirement. A period would be required beforethe Bretton Woods provisions could go into effect and the international monetary fund could relieve exchange difficulties, and during that period the canadian government contemplated having to finance purchases in Canada of food-stuffs and other materials by Canada&apos;s traditional customers.    The recovery  so
furnished would, however, be a debt owed to Canada by the countries concerned and repayable in full, hence the Governments contention that it should beregarded quite separately from the budgetary figure of Canadian expenditures.15. The most important of the general taxation provisions of the budget isa reduction of 16 per cent, in the rate of personal income tax as from the1st October. At the same time the exemption from income tax allowed to naval personnel serving afloat and flying personnel of the R.C.A.F. has been abolished.The 100 per cent, excess profits tax is reduced to 60 per cent, from the 1st January,1946, while the 20 per cent, refundable portion of this tax is abolished. The10 per cent, war exchange tax on imports from non-Empire countries isdiscontinued as from the 12th October.16. An unusually bad summer has had an adverse effect on this year&apos;s wheatharvest, and the estimate for the 1945 wheat crop for the Dominion stands at321 million bushels, which, with the estimated carry-over at the 31st July, will mean an available supply of 580 million bushels. This is the smallest available supply since 1938, and is no less than 212 million bushels lower than lastyear&apos;s figures. The potato crop has also suffered, the estimated return being35 million cwt. as compared with 49-1 million last year.Service Activities.17. Canadian Military forces continued to carry out occupational duties in north-Western Europe.18. On the 5th October No. 120 R.C.A.F. transport wing was formed from three R.C.A.F. Dakota squadrons, and these have been operating in the Europeantheatre.19. No. 126 R.C.A.F. Spitfire wing, comprising four R.C.A.F. Spitfiresquadrons, has been located at Utersen in Germany, where varied training hasbeen carried out.20. Of the four R.C.A.F. Lancaster Heavy Bomber squadrons forming partof No. 1 Group, Bomber Command, two have been disbanded, while the other twohave been flying personnel to and from Italy and Germany.21. Of the two R.C A.F., A.O.P., squadrons, one has been disbanded, whilethe other has been located at Odenburg in Germany.22. No. 426 R.C.A.F. Liberator squadron has been located in the UnitedKingdom, and has been transporting personnel and supplies to Karachi.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.23. Addressing a meeting of journalists in Sydney, the Prime Minister,Mr. J. Chiftey, referring to the financial talks now taking place in Washington,said that never before in the history of the British Empire had it become sonecessary that all associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations should stand firmly together in any decisions made. These talks would vitally affectall the Dominions, and, as there must be a new approach to imports from dollar countries, Australia and other Dominions must adjust their economies to meetthat situation.24. Dr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, has been appointed torepresent Australia at the first meeting of the Far Eastern Advisory Commissionin Washington.25. The Commonwealth Government has announced plans for thn taking over of the production and distribution of coal in New South Wales for a periodof five years.26. Speaking on the question of Australian Reciprocal Aid to the UnitedStates, Mr. Chifley said that the recorded total of Australian Lease-Lendexpenditure to June 1945 had amounted to  358 million. Of this sum, 70 million was for provisions&apos;.27.   A summary of Australia^ war effort prepared by the CommonwealthDepartment of Information shows that in the six years of war, Australia^[30984] b 2
population of 7,300,000 produced almost 1 million men for full-time service inthe fighting forces, and 66,000 women for service in the auxiliaries. The war had cost Australia 95,561 casualties.28. The latest estimate of the Australian wheat harvest is 135 million bushels. Drought has been responsible for the large decline in the earlierestimate of 150 million bushels.29. The Australian Women&apos;s Land Army, which was formed in May 1943,is expected to be disbanded before the end of the year. The total membership is nearly 3,000.30. Control of the press by a statutory commission, abolition of StateParliaments and Senates, and the resubmission of the referendum to transferpowers from the States to the Commonwealth, are among the 184 resolutions onthe agenda of the Inter-State Conference of the Australian Labour Party to beheld at Canberra on the 26th November. Other resolutions deal with theintroduction of a 40-hour working week and the abolition of the means test inthe allocation of pensions.31. The Premier of Victoria, Mr. Dunstan, resigned during October andwas succeeded by Mr. Ian Macfarlane, who formed a stop-gap Ministry pending a General Election.32. Alexander Kerensky, Prime Minister of the Russian ProvisionalGovernment in 1917, whose wife is Australian born, is reported as having sailed from British Columbia for Australia, wmei&apos;e he intends to reside.Service A activities.33. Troops of five Australian Divisions still continue to carry out occu-national duties in the S.W.P.A., with the Ninth and Seventh Australian infantry divisions in North and Dutch Borneo, the Sixth Australian Infantry division in New Guinea, the Eleventh Australian Infantry Division in New Britain, andthe Third Australian Infantry Division in Bougainville.34. Troops of A.M.F. accepted the surrender of the Japanese in Nauru aridOcean Islands at Nauru on the 13th September, 1945. The British resident commissioner for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and representatives of the NewZealand Government and the British Phosphate Commission were present at the ceremony. The occupation of Nauru Island was complete on the 15th september and of Ocean Island on the 1st October, 1945. Evacuation to Torokina of theJapanese on Ocean Island was completed on the 5th October, and evacuation ofthose on Nauru Island was proceeding. The civil postal and radio telegraphservice to Ocean Island was reopened on the 8th October, 1945.35. The first Tactical Air Force of the R.A.A.F. had some 25 squadronsoperating with land forces from airfields in the areas of Labuan, Tarrakan andMorotai.NEW ZEALAND.36. Domestic interest has centred around two Bills which have been intro-duced into the House of Representatives. The Social Security Bill providesfor a minimum family income, and increases age, widows&apos;, miners&apos;, invalids&apos;,sickness, unemployment, and family benefits.37. The other Bill, the Electoral Amendment Bill, provides for theabolition of the country quota which gave higher value to the rural vote; theallocation of seats on the basis of the adult population, thus eliminating fromthe reckoning the children, who are more numerous in country districts; andfor the application of new rules in the white constituencies but not to Maoriconstituencies. Criticism of the Bill has followed the lines that the reductionin the number of rural seats, where the Government is in a minority, and theincrease in the number of urban seats, of which it holds an overwhelming majority, is unfair.38. There was some trouble at Wellington during October, when watersideworkers at that port, following the lea^l 0f the Australian waterside workers,refused to load a Dutch ship bound for Java, despite an assurance by the
Netherlands Consul-General that the ship was only taking relief supplies.Local newspaper comment has, in the main, been hostile to the waterside workers,on the ground that the Union is claiming to dictate the foreign policy of theGovernment.39. Mr. A. M, Warren, has succeeded Mr. K. S. Patton as United StatesMinister in New Zealand.Service A activities.40. The Second New Zealand Division continued to carry out occupationalduties in Italy during the month of October.41. In the S.W.P.A., the R.N.Z.A.F. had two transport squadrons andone flying-boat squadron in operation, while one bomber reconnaissance squadron and two fighter squadrons were in the process of reforming.UNION OP SOUTH AFRICA.42. Opening the convention of the South African Federated Chamber ofIndustries, the Prime Minister, Field-Marshal Smuts, said that the war had given an immense fillip to industry, and industrialists could go ahead with confidence that they would have the backing of the Government. He lookedforward to the time when South Africa would have a much greater populationthan at present. The Union was lagging behind other countries in the matterof an immigration policy, with the result that the country&apos;s growth was beingfrustrated.43. Mr. Madeley, Minister of Labour, and leader of the Labour Party,has tendered his resignation. He has taken this step in anticipation of a partydecision, expected at the end of the year, to withdraw from the Coalition. TheUnited Party has an absolute majority over all other parties in Parliament, andits position will, therefore, not be seriously affected even if the Dominion Party,under Colonel Stallard, Minister of Mines, follows the Labour lead.44. A deputation, consisting of members of the Natal Municipal Associa-tion and the Durban City Council, met the Prime Minister, Field-marshal smuts, at Pretoria, for discussions on the Indian problem in Natal. Delegatesasked the Prime Minister to confirm or deny rumours that the government intended making another attempt to implement the Pretoria agreement, but no!reply was given on this point.45. It is announced that Russia has agreed to accept a goodwill mission from South Africa consisting of industrialists, economists, artists, trade unionists, engineers, medical men, and others. The arrangements are to be inthe hands of the South African Friends of the Soviet Union, and the Govern-ment is being asked to co-operate by releasing State experts to accompany themission, which will leave the Union next April.46. A mission, headed by Mr. D. H. C. du Plessis, the new Harbour and shipping Manager of the South African Railways, is shortly going overseasto buy ships and modern railway coaches. It is hoped to obtain three or fourmodern sea-going ships of 8,000 tons, and also smaller coastal vessels withrefrigeration facilities.47. Considerable interest has recently been shown in the Tennessee ValleyAuthority developments, and suggestions have been made that regional planning should supersede provincial groupings. In particular, the possibilities of developing the Vaal Valley industrially and agriculturally as an economic unit,are being explored.48. The United Party has issued a brochure expressing what it calls the&quot;Black Record &quot; of South African nationalism during the war. Cases ofdissemination of Nazi propaganda, insults to soldiers and public men, are quoted,and the publication points out that the Government policy of ignoring the&quot; rantings of political sharp-shooters&quot; was justified, as treason trials wouldhave served to increase the prestige of the offenders in the eyes of their followers.49. In order to enable the Union to join the United Nations organisation as a foundation member, the United Nations Charter has been ratified by
executive action. Parliament will be consulted about this matter at the earliest!opportunity next session. -50. On the recommendation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Unionof South Africa, The King has approved of the appointment of the Hon. GideonBrand van Zyl as Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. Major vanZyl, at present Administrator of the Cape Province, will assume office inJanuary 1946.   Major van Zyl is 72.Service A activities.51. The Sixth South African Armoured Division continued to carry outoccupational duties in Italy.52. According to the latest co-ordinated reports, the S.A.A.P. had sixsquadrons operating in the Central Mediterranean and Middle East.EIRE.53. Mr. Lemass, the Eire Minister for Industry and Commerce, visitedLondon at the beginning of October. The primary object of his visit was todiscuss our transport questions with the Minister of Civil Aviation; but theopportunity was also taken for him to have informal talks with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of fuel and Transport, and the Minister of Food, on matters of common concern.54. The value of Eire exports and imports for the nine months ending the30th September last, compared with the corresponding period last year, was 1945. 1944-  &apos;   Exports    .........      23,924,710 19,454,457Imports    .........      28,808,385 20,507,803INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.55. The interest of the political parties was concentrated throughoutOctober on the preparations for the elections to the Central and provincial legislatures. It is still too soon to predict the fortunes of the parties. the moslem League is clearly in difficulties with the Moslem parties which do not accept its leadership, but it may be that the slogan of Pakistan will ensure it thesupport of the majority of the Moslem electorate. The Congress party issued itselection manifesto late in October; it endorsed the resolution of August 1942 andstaked its appeal, as was expected, on the issue of independence. There have been no political developments during the month nor is it likely that there will be anyuntil the smoke of the election battle has cleared away.Frontier and Foreign Relations.North- West Frontier.56. Deliveries of grain in Waziristan have eased the situation and the tribalareas were generally quiet.A fghanistaii.57. Latest reports stated that the situation in the Eastern Province had improved. As a result of further military operations west of Kunar, the Safiswere reported to have submitted to the Afghan Government, after securingmitigation of the original terms including the postponement of conscription.(The attempted enforcement of conscription was the main cause of the revolt.)Mohmand interest in the trouble appears to have subsided. In the southern province, Afghan irregular forces and tribal levies are engaged in rounding upcertain prominent malcontents just west of the Durand Line where it forms thefrontier with Madda Khel territories in Waziristan.
58. The Commander-in-Chief, India, General Auchinleck, visited Katmanduat the invitation of the Nepalese Government and received in Durbar, on theoccasion of the return from India of the Contingent of the Nepalese Army, aVepalese Decoration and the honorary rank of General in the Nepalese Army.The King has approved honorary awards of British and Indian honours for$epalese officers who gave distinguished service with the Nepalese-Contingent inIndia and Burma.Sinkiang.59. The situation is confused, but recent telegrams received indicated that negotiations were in progress at Urumchi between the Turki rebels and emissariesfrom the Central Government at Chungking.Representatives of Government of India A broad.60. The Cabinet have approved the upgrading of the status of the IndianAgents-General in Washington and Chungking to that of Minister. HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Chungking,have been instructed to approach the Governments to which they are accreditedfor their consent.United Nations Organisation.61. In addition to Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, who will lead the indian delegation to the First General Assembly, India will be represented by Sir V.Krishnamachari and Sir S. Runganadhan, with Sir John Bartley and Mr. M.Ikhramullah as advisers.Service Activities.General.62. During the month the reoccupation of Burma and Malaya proceededsmoothly. The disarming and concentration of Japanese forces was effectedwithout incident. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands were reoccupied and the surrender of the Japanese was carried out.63. In the French Indo-China area and in Siam there has been a certainamount of opposition from local elements.64. In the Netherlands East Indies there has been, unfortunately, a con-siderable amount of difficulty and the forces which were landed with orders to evacuate A.P.W.I. and disarm the Japanese forces had to be reinforced.R.A.P.W.I.65.   79,157 RA.P.W.I. have been evacuated from S.E.A.C.66. Excluding&apos; Dutch and others remaining in Siam, Singapore, HongIvong and Javanese in F.I.C. there remain 2,112 R.A.P.W.I. available to be moved, but of these about half are either temporarily remaining in their presentlocations to assist in administrative problems or are hospital cases.Air Forces.67. 866 operational sorties were flown by aircraft of A.C.S.E.A. betweenhe 1st and 30th October : information for the 31st October has not yet beenreceived. The biggest item was the carriage of supplies and personnel intoex-enemy-occupied territories (particularly in the early part of the month) andthe evacuation of ex-Prisoners of War and internees (particularly in the latter half of the month) from these territories : 482 sorties were flown for these purposes, 114 of these being flown towards the end of the month by capturedJapanese transport aircraft. Special duty flights for the benefit of ourclandestine forces continued throughout the month, the best part of 200 sortiesbeing flown for this purpose.68. In the last week of the month the situation in N.E.I. called for specialair action and 47 sorties were flown for reconnaissance and demonstration over^emarang and Surabaya.  Aircraft operating at Surabaya were engaged by small
arms fire, though there were no casualties to aircraft, and one Catalina carrying!Dutch naval officers to Surabaya was forced to return for this reason.69.   The remaining sorties were flown for miscellaneous purposes, including Itransit flights, reconnaissance and searches, leaflet dropping, escort, spraying withdisinfectant and, in South Burma, the dropping of currency.70.   There was only one casualty to aircraft during the month when aSunderland was lost carrying evacuated personnel from Singapore to Madras; it;was later located by aerial reconnaissance burnt out north-west of Singaporewith 12 bodies.Military.71.   Burma.-A few more cases of dacoity have been reported.72. The Japanese forces have been disarmed and some 63,000 are being concentrated in dispersed camps.73. Malaya A shortage of rice, it has been reported, is responsible for anumber of incidents in which troops have been assaulted by mobs. There havebeen strikes in the dock areas of Singapore, but on the whole the colony has beenfree from trouble.74. It was decided to concentrate disarmed Japanese on Rempang island and 5,700 of the 123,000 have already been despatched.75. Andamans. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been reoccupied.The attitude of the Japanese Garrison was very satisfactory and the troops havebeen disarmed.76. F.I.C The occupation of F.I.C. in co-operation with French forceshas been carried out. The southern half of the country is the responsibility ofthe British/French command. There has been a certain amount of opposition from Annamite forces and there have been a few casualties in spite of the truce.The French forces carried out a successful water-borne operation at Mytho. TheJapanese are being disarmed and are co-operating satisfactorily.77. Siam. The Japanese are being disarmed and 114,000 have been dealtwith up to the 24th October, of whom some 92,000&apos; are concentrated in four areas.78. Netherlands East Indies. -The original plan was frustrated by theattitude of the Indonesians and it was impossible to release A.P.W.I. and proceedwith the disarmament of the Japanese. Owing to the opposition of the indonesians the Japanese forces had to remain for a time in certain areas for theprotection of Dutch and other Allied P.O.W. and reinforcements were seen to benecessary for the British forces. The R.A.P.W.I. camps in five places are nowunder British guards.79. There have been many instances of firing between the Indonesians and allied forces. In Java up to the 30th October there have been 32 casualties to allied troops.80. In Sumatra the general situation remains quiet, but Indonesians refuseto co-operate with the Dutch.   The recovery of A.P.W.I. progressed favourably.81. The Commander. 25 Japanese Army, signed the surrender on the21st October and three vital areas are now occupied by our forces.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.82. Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, Governor of Burma, returned to Rangoonon the 16th October bearing with him a Gracious Message from His Majesty aswell as messages of congratulations and good wishes from the Prime ministers of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and from the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Burma. He expounded the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards Burma in a speech which he delivered at a civic reception in Rangoon on the 17th October, and also in a broadcast which he gave on thefollowing evening. These pronouncements were, on the whole, well receivedthough it was not to be expected that they would altogether escape criticism.
83. In application of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as set out in-the White Paper (Cmd. 6633) of May 1945 the Governor on his return tookimmediate steps to constitute an Executive Council and let it be known that he proposed in due course also to set up a Legislative Council. The function of bothbodies will be to aid and advise him during the period which must elapse before a general election can be held and the normal operation of the Constitution of1937 be revived, pending the working out by the representatives of Burma of thenew constitution which is to replace it. The most important political organisa-tion in the field at the moment is represented by the Anti-Fascist People&apos;s Inde-pendence League. This body, which has shown strong totalitarian tendencies,when asked by the Governor,to nominate representatives who could sit on the newExecutive Council, put forward demands as the condition of their co-operation which were of so extreme a character that the Governor, with the full approvalof His Majesty&apos;s Government, was unable to accept them. They includeddemands that they should be allowed to nominate the Legislative Council whenappointed; that they should also have power to allocate portfolios and to take exception to selections for portfolios made by the Governor. The Governor was required also to accept en bloc the seven nominees out of a total of eleven appoint-ments who the A.F.P.I.L. (who claim to be in a position to speak on behalf of burma as a whole) recommended to him.84. The Governor could not accept the claims of A.F.P.I.L. to speak for burma as a whole, and negotiations to secure their support having in the circum-stances described above proved abortive, he turned to other political leaders. Itis signficant that no fewer than three of the politicians who had been includedin the A.F.P.I.L. list thereupon decided to sever their connection with that body and to join the Executive Council. The Governor finally decided to make 12appointments to the Council as against a statutory maximum of 15. Of these,12, 9 are Burmese non-officials, most of them with long experience of public life and one an ex-Prime Minister. The remaining three are European officials.Portfolios have now been assigned to the Members of the Council, and the Councilitself has started to function. The A.F.P.I.L., while, on the information avail-able, somewhat taken aback by the Governor&apos;s decision to dispense with their assistance, have continued to behave correctly; but the indications are that theywill exert every form of political pressure on the new Executive Council and onthe Governor.85. The disbandment of the Patriotic Burma Forces and the amalgamation of some two-thirds of them with the regular Burma Army are understood to havebeen proceeding satisfactorily. A detailed report has been called for. In themeantime, &quot; Major-General &quot; Aung San, the former commander of the P.B.F.,has decided to remain in political life, and has declined to accept the commission which was offered him with a view to his being appointed one of the two DeputyInspector-Generals of the reconstituted Burma Army. The discussion on thereformation of the Army is proceeding between the Governments of Burma andIndia, and S.A.C.S.E.A. The P.B.F. in the meantime have, in some areas, shown a greater spirit of co-operation. They are reported to have assisted the police on some occasions and their disarmament has been reported as proceeding satis-factorily. The quantity of arms in the country is, however, even so, at presentso large as still to give grounds for anxiety.86. The A.F.P.I.L. maintained a great deal of activity. Messages of congratulation were sent to India on Gandhi&apos;s birthday, and Aung San attended a meeting to promote Sino-Burman relations at which he called for a Chinese leadin South-East Asia through which Burma&apos;s independence might be furthered.The A.F.P.I.L. continued to make overtures to the Karen minority who, however,remain suspicious and aloof, and are reluctant to trust their interests to such a body. Crime continues to decrease, but the police are still, in some districts,embarrassed by, or in awe of, the P.B.F.87. Communications and supplies continued to be a great source of anxiety.Arakan was said to be virtually isolated and the roads in Rangoon are sufferingfrom years of neglect during the occupation. The indications are that the portcapacity of Rangoon is likely to be limited. Moreover, the dock strike in theUnited Kingdom has already had an adverse effect on the shipping programme to Burma, As an instance, a much-needed shipment of vehicles, due to leave inOctober, is not now expected to sail before late November.[30984] c
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Palestine.88. The joint Jewish /Arab citrus delegation has now left for Palestine,having concluded arrangements for substantial sales in Europe as well as to theMinistry of Food. Useful discussions took place regarding the production inPalestine of vitamin concentrates, to replace supplies formerly obtained underLend/Lease, and on the long-term problems of the industry.89. The delegation departed professing themselves to be well pleased withtheir visit, and it is perhaps noteworthy that the Jewish and Arab membersappear to have worked together in complete harmony.West Africa.90. Cocoa. The presence and activities in this country of a self-styled&quot;Cocoa Farmers&apos; delegation&quot; gave rise to some doubts rgarding-the smoothopening of the buying season for what will probably be the last year of control in its present form. The delegation has set itself to decry both the presentcontrol and the plans for future policy published last year, which it is proposedshortly to elaborate in a White Paper. The delegation have, however, had nosuccess, and it is. known that .they are closely connected with interests in theUnited States and this country who are bitterly opposed to the rationalisedmarketing of cocoa in the interests of the producers.British Colonies Supply Mission.91. The life of the British Colonies Supply Mission, Washington, is to end on the 31st December next. Colonial Governments have found its services ofthe greatest value during the war years, but for the last month or two its work has naturally been falling off.Defence.Demobilisation of members of Colonial Volunteer Defence Forces evacuated fromJapanese prison camps in the Far East.92. See paragraph 101 of September report. About 750 European volunteershave now arrived in this country and arrangements have been completed for the demobilisation of over half that number. Arrangements have also been made to repatriate a number of volunteers whose homes are not in the United kingdom to their own countries. In addition to this a number of volunteers have beendemobilised in the Dominions, India, United States and the Far East, wherearrangements have been made with the appropriate authorities.Repatriation of African Troops from South-East Asia Command.93. Owing to the present great shortage of shipping space, the repatriation of African Troops in South-East Asia Command to their home Colonies has hadto be slowed down. The Commander-in-Chief, India, has pointed out the dangersin retaining African Troops in the Far East without any definite employment, andit has been agreed that it is important to repatriate these troops as soon aspossible.Report on Industrial Colonies.Malaya.94. As Special Representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Malaya,Sir Harold MacMichael signed on the 20th October and on the 24th Octoberrespectively new treaties with the Sultan of Johore and the Sultan of Selangor,whereby full power and jurisdiction in these States is ceded to His majesty the King.
Cyprus.95. Demonstrations by Cypriot troops returning to service after havingspent leave in Cyprus occurred. The cause is attributed to delay in demobilisation and to further overseas service. A demonstration at Famagusta caused a clash between Cypriot and Indian troops which is under enquiry.West Indies.96. Anglo-American Caribbean Commission. After discussion with theUnited States authorities, of which the Canadian Government have been keptfully informed, invitations have been extended simultaneously by the UnitedStates Government and by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the French and Nether-lands Governments to participate, on the same basis as the Americans and ourselves, in an enlarged Commission, to be called the Caribbean Commission,and in the bodies established under its auspices, such as the West Indian conference and the Caribbean Research Council. Their replies have not yet been &apos;received.Pcdestine.97. Political. In the absence of an authoritative announcement on thefuture of Palestine the press abandoned &quot;intelligent speculation&quot; for gossipculled from the Lobbies of London and Washington. To this the bewilderedpublic was more or less indifferent knowing that a statement, at least of an interimnature, was imminent. Early in the month confirmation of President Truman&apos;s appeal to Mr. Attlee provided a focus for Jewish hopes and Arab fears, both ofwhich were subsequently dissipated by Mr. Byrnes&apos;s statement on the 20th Octoberthat the President regarded Palestine as only one among several alternatives for relief of Jewish distress in Europe.98. Jewish opinion became increasingly vociferous in demand for theimmediate creation of a Jewish State and the repudiation of even a modifiedcontinuance of the provisions of the 1939 White Paper. At a mass meeting heldin a Jewish centre on the 8th October, support for this doctrine was voiced evenby the factions hitherto opposed to political maximalism. The whole jewish community is unanimous for the slogan &quot; immigration from all sources by all means.&quot;99. Fears of a decision on the Palestine issue not consonant with Jewishaspirations led to a crisis in the Jewish community. It was rumoured that dr. Weizmann would resign and even that the whole Jewish Agency Executivemight resign in the event of an unsatisfactory pronouncement by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Negotiations, so far inconclusive, are in progress for the creationof a united front under an Emergency Committee. It appears that, apart from a determination to promote immigration legally and illegally by every method andto resist search of Jewish colonies by force, no conclusions have yet been reached as to the line of action to be adopted locally in the event of an adverse decision byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.100. Arab reaction to these events has hardly extended beyond formal protest, the public and political leaders alike resting secure in the belief that theforthcoming decision will be in their favour and that, even if it is not, the inter-vention of the Arab Governments and League will somehow secure its reversal.101. This sense of security lulled Arab politics almost to slumber. Therewere signs of an attempt to form a new political party, the &quot; Hizb Es Shaab &quot;or &quot; People&apos;s Party.&quot; The party was scarcely hatched before it was driven back into its shell by unauthorised publication in an Arabic newspaper of a draftpolitical programme, still the subject of dispute in the Party itself, which had fallen into the hands of a member of the &quot; Istiqlal &quot; Party through the connivanceof a dissenter.102. Security. On the 6th October a party of Syrian Jews, who had enteredPalestine illegally, after assaulting two officers of the T.J.F.F. who questionedthem, made their way into Kfar Giladi Settlement near Metulla on the Syrianfrontier. A cordon of Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was thrown round thesettlement. Attempts to break through by Jews from neighbouring settlements,and to disarm some soldiers, were resisted with rifle fire. Eight Jews werewounded, none fatally.
103. On the night of the 10th October a number of armed Jews cut thewire surrounding Athlit Clearance Camp and assisted 208 illegal immigrants to escape. A Christian woman in the camp was gagged and died from suffocation.During subsequent operations a British constable was shot dead and an Arabconstable seriously wounded when fired on by Jews from ambush. Nine of the illegal immigrants subsequently arrested on the Carmel Range were rescued bya large party of Jews armed with pick-helves, the Police in charge of the arrestedpersons having forborne to use firearms.104. On the night of the 11th October 218 rifles and bayonets, 15 machine guns of various types and a quantity of ammunition were stolen by Jews from palestine Training Depot at Rehovot.105. On the morning of the 16th October two armed Jews ambushed amilitary truck carrying some  (P) 14,000 pay for troops at a neighbouring camp.The Jewish Major and escort of three Jewish soldiers on the truck opened fire on the attackers, who made off.  The only known casualty was one Arab bystander.106. During the night of the 31st October a series of concerted attacks weremade by armed Jews on the Palestine Railway system, culminating with a full-scale attack on the railway station and goods yard at Lydda. Casualties were :killed, 1 British soldier, 1 Palestinian policeman, and 2 Palestinian membersof the railway staff; wounded, 1 British soldier, 1 Palestinian policeman and Palestinian members of the railway staff. The dead body of one Jewishattacker was found near Lydda. During the same night two police launches atanchor in Haifa harbour were extensively damaged, apparently by limpet bombs and a third police launch was blown up and sunk at Jaffa. An unsuccessfulattempt was also made on the Consolidated Refineries installation at Haifa.107. A number of illegal propaganda broadcasts have been made by theHagana, possibly by means of a mobile transmitter; recently three broadcastshave been interrupted by a pro-British &quot; ghost &quot;voice, so far unidentified.108. There were 105 anti-terrorist raids in the course of the month, resulting in the detention of 34 persons. The total number under detention on the20th October was 461.109. Trans-Jordan. There was a small-scale anti-Zionist demonstration inAmman and other towns on the 14th October, without any serious breach of thepeace.
