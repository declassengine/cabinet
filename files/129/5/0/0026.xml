THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos;HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 326.3rd December, 1945.CABINET.REPORT BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE ON CHANGESIN WAR PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I agree with the proposals of the Social Services Committee (OP. (45) 300)except for that part of recommendation (e) which relates to recognition, for pur-poses of dependants&apos; allowances, of the post-injury wife and children, while the disabled man is alive.2. On this type of case we are in a dilemma. There is difficulty, on theone hand, in defending a difference of treatment of the wife and children of awar pensioner by reference to whether the date of marriage was before or after the injury. There is difficulty, on the other hand, in recognising wives and children inthe case of war pensions as qualifying the pensioner for a dependants allowancecontinuously, i.e., whether he is at work or not, and recognising wives and children in the case of industrial injury allowances as qualifying the injured man fordependants&apos; allowances only when he is unable to work.3. If war pensions alone were in question, I should be ready to agree torecognise post-injury wives and children, primarily on the ground that the charge would after a few years be a diminishing one. But it is clear that, if the present proposal is accepted, it will be difficult for us to resist the pressure that will undoubtedly arise for recognition on war pension lines of wives and children inthe case of industrial injuries. The Minister&apos;s present defence of difference oftreatment, based on the fact that the war pensions treatment of pre-injury wives and children is a long-standing practice limited to liabilities existing at a definitedate in the case of each man and diminishing fairly rapidly, would be gone.Payment of allowances, whether the husband was at work or not, in the case ofindustrial injury benefits would be a permanent feature of the scheme. I have examined whether it would be possible to introduce limitations, either by-reference to the age at marriage, or to the interval of time between the injuryand marriage, but I have come to the conclusion that such limitations would notbe practicable.4. On merits, the policy of the Industrial Injury Scheme is clearly the rightone. It is justifiable to pay an allowance to the man himself in respect of hisdisability, whether he is working or not. It is not justifiable to pay allowances for his dependants when he is in work, particularly when the Family AllowancesAct comes into operation.5. I suggest, therefore, that we should take the line that the present treat-ment of pre-injury wives and children under the War Pensions Scheme is an existing practice which we do not propose to disturb, but which we think shouldnot be extended in its range by bringing in new classes of case. The right line in our view is to deal with the wife and children, only where the pensioner is unable to work. It is in harmony with this line that the post-injury widow willin future be recognised both for Avar pensions and for industrial injury wherethe pensioners death is attributable to the injury.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1945.
