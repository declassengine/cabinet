JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)124COPY NO.      4 eCABINETNATIONAL INSJJRANCE scheme memorandum by the Lord Privy seal,      At their meeting on 6th December (C.M.(h5)  60th Conclusions,Minute h)  the Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary,  theChancellor of the Exchequer,  the Minister of Labour and NationalService, the Minister of National Insurance and myself to consider further,  in the light of the discussion,  the problemsrelating tothe payment of unemployment benefit and the rate of retirement pension.2*     Unemployment Benefit.     We agree that it must be the most urgent task of&quot;the Government to see that the conditions which led. to long term unemployment in certain areas during theyears between the wars do not recur, and that, unless theGovernment fail in this task,  it should normally be possibleto provide suitable work or training to the genuine type ofunemployed person long before ho has drawn benefit for30 weeks.    We also agree that the conditions for the paymentof unemployment benefit in the existing law should bemaintained.    The effect of these is that benefit is notpayable if a claim.io.nt refuses an offer of suitable workin his own trade at any time, or,  after he has been drawingbenefit for some time,  a reasonable offer of work in another trade.    In either case the question whether an offer of employment outside a mar.T s home district yould be suitablewould depend, .. among other things, on the man s individualcircumstances end the length of time for which he had beenunemployed.It is,  in our view,  impossible to add to the safeguards inthe existing law without virtually importing the &quot;not genuinelyseeking work&apos;&apos;  condition.      Thus the issue Is narrowed down towhether the new scheme should provide (i)  that,  as at present,the insured person&apos;s title to benefit should cease after 30weeks (with extensions for persons with good employment recordsup to as much as 52 weeks),.or (ii)  that there should be no time limit on the payment of benefit.The Minister of National Insurance feels that, hoy/eversuccessful the Government&apos;s employment x-^policy may be,  there willbe some genuine cases on whom the withdrawal of benefit after30 weeks will bear hardly,  and he argues that,  if the Statecannot offer work or training to an unemployed man before the expiry of 30 weeks,  it is no help towards a solution of theman&apos;s problem to say to him that in future he must depend on assistance, payable subject to an enquiry into his   means.      Hehas also pointed out that the Trades Union Congress in a recentdeputation expressed themselves as strongly in favour of theremoval of the time limit *SECRETCP. (U-5)  33111 TH DECEMBER 1919

The Foreign Secretary,  the -Chancellor of the exchequer.ecj.uerand the Minister of Labour and National&apos;Service, whileappreciating the point of view of the Minister of national insurance, regard it as of the utmost importance that theprinciple of insurance should be preserved in the arrangementsfor unemployment &quot;benefit, and. they.believe that, unless thetime is retained,  it will be difficult to prevent certainclaimants who have no real intention of taking up steadyemployment from drawing benefit for practically unlimitedperiods, with the result that an unfair burden will be imposed on the insurance fund.    For example, a married woman who didnot intend to re-enter the labour market might draw benefit for a very long time particularly since it would not beregarded as reasonable tb offer her work in a district otherthan that in which she was living.    These Ministers accordingly recommend that the present time limit should be retained andthat the Government should nest their main defence of thison their determination to prevent a recurrence of the longcontinued unemployment which occurred in certain areas betweenthe. warsi    In order to meet the views expressed by theMinister of National Insurance, however, they suggest that,before the National Insurance Bill is introduced, thepossibility should be considered of adjusting,  zi may benecessary, the conditions on which assistance is given by theAssistance Board to persons who have exhausted their rightto unemployment benefit.We regret that we have been unable to reach agreement andmust leave it to the Cabinet to decide in the light of the considerations set out above.3*    Rate of Retirement Pension.    The question which we were asked to consider is whether the rate of retirement pension for a single person should be 21s.  or 26s.    The objectionwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to a rate of 26s.was that this would involve an increasingly heavy addition tothe burden *n the Exchequer over the next twenty years.    Onthe other hand, the Social Services Committee felt that separately of 26s-. would be much easier to defend, since it wouldbe linked with the&apos; rates proposed for unemployment and sickness benefit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has new agreed ta separately of 26s-.  on the clear understanding that there can be noyielding to pressure to increase the rate beyond 26s.  whenthe National Insurance Bill is before Parliament and on condition that specific provision is made in the Bill.for a   -suitable increase in the amount of the contributions afterthe scheme has been in operation for five years to meetsome part of the additional burden due to the increased rate.

4,      Insrease of Retirement Pension for Deferred Retirement.At the meeting of  the Cabinet on 6th December it was agreedthat  the payment of pension should be conditional on retire-ment, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that hewas prepared to consider an increase in the rate of pension of 2s,6d.  a week for a single person and 5s.  a week for a couple for  each yoar by which retirement was postponed.    If,however, the basic rate of pension is raised to 26s.  a week,it seems reasonable to reduce the rate of increase and we accordingly recommend that the  inducement for deferredretirement should be an increase of Is.  a week in the case ofthe single person and 2s.  a week in the case of a couple foreach six months by which retirement is postponed,   the 2s.being payable only where the wife, as well as the husband,has reached pensionable age.      When a man has attained theage of 70 (or a woman   the age of 65)  it will be automaticallyassumed that he or she has retired and pension will become payable.     Thus tho maximum retirement pension payable willbe 36s. for a single person and 62s.  for a couple.      (72s. fora couple where the wife is insured in her own right).We fool, however, some apprehension about  the effect ofthe retirement condition in certain industries, where,  owingto  the nature of the work, men  are unable to continue towork much beyond the age of 65 and would therefore be unableto qualify for tho- increase of pension rewarded for deferredretirement.      We consider that  this difficulty might be met by separate schemes for particular industries, and,  if anysuch  schemes were sot up,  the machinery of the national insurance scheme could be made available for them.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer has also undertaken to giveconsideration to the provision of a certaincontribution towards the cost of any such schemes.5,      Contributions.      The Social ServicesCommi ttee recommendedthat the weekly contribution from a man in Class I should notexceed 4s.6d.      It seems clear, however,   that the benefits which the national insurance scheme will provide are worthmore  than  this to  the workers and the Social services committee of the Parliamentary Labour Par ty have indicated that 5s. is the maximum contribution which could be borne.Accordingly,  in view of our proposal in paragraph 3 thatthe basic rate of retirement pension for a single person should be fixed at 26s., we recommend   that the initial rateof contribution in Class I should be 4s.l0d. from the employed man and 4s.2d.  from the employer and  that the Billshould provide that  after five years  these rates should  beincreased  to 5s.   and 4s. 4d. respectively.      These figures are based on tho assumption that the present limit of30 weeks on the payment of unemployment benefit will beretained.    If it were decided to pay continuous benefitunemployment the initial Class I rates would require to be5s. for  the  employed man and 4s. 5d.  for the employer, rising to 5s.2d.  and 4s.7d.   after  five years.

1276,      To sum up, the Cabinet is asked -(a) to decide, in the light of the considerations set out in paragraph 2 above, whether thepresent limit of 30 weeks on the payment ofunerap1oyrcent benefit should be retained;(b) to approve the payment of retirement pensions to single persons at the rate of 26s.  a. week,on the understanding that any pressure for anincrease in this rate when the Bill is beforeParliament will be resolutely resisted;  (seeParagraph 3 above).(c)    to agree that the inducement to postponeretirement should, be an increase of Is.  aweek in the case of a single person and 2s.a week in the case of a couple, both ofwhom are of pensionable age, for each sixmonths by which retirement is postponed;(see paragraph 4 above)&apos;and   (d)    to approve the proposal that for Class I the initial rates of contribution should be 4s.l0d.from the employed man end 4s. 2d. from the employer (or 5s. and 4s. 5d. respectively ifthere is no limit on the payment of unemploymentbenefit), and that the Bill should specificallyprovide that after a period of five years these rates should rise to 5s. and 4s.4d.   (or 5s. 2d.  and4s.7d.), corresponding rates being fixed forwomen and persons in Classes II and IV.(See paragraph 5 above).C-wydyr House, S.W, 1.11TH DECEMBER,  1945
