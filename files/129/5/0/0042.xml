In view of the trend of discussions at the PreparatoryConraission of the United Nations on the Trusteeship systemestablished by Chapter XII of the United Nations Charter,it will probably be necessary to make some statement on thopolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to mandated territories under its administration at the first meetingof the General Assembly which is at present to convene on10th January.    I should,  therefore, like a definite cabinet decision as to what Territories for which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom holds the Mandate, shouldbe placed under the International Trusteeship system.2.     Article 77 of the Chapter reads:-&apos;M .      The trusteeship system shall apply to such terri-torios in the following categories as may be placedthereunder by means of trusteeship agreements:--(a)    territories now held under mandate;(b)    territories which may be detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War;andCOPY NO.(c) territories voluntarily placed unbler thesystem by States responsible for theiradiiii ni s t rat i on.3.      The territories concerned:-Pale s tine and Truns-JordanTanganyikaTogoland under British MandateGamereons under British Mandate-Administered byHis Majesty&apos;s, Government in the&quot;united Kingdom4.     I wish to draw my colleagues&apos; attention to one important point of principle, which must be considered in relation toony decision to place any of our existing Mandated territories under Trusteeship.   Article 8o of the Charter reads asfollows:-1o     Except as may be agreed upon in individual trustee-ship agreements, made under Articles 77, 79 and 81,placing each territory under the trusteeship system, and

until such agreements have &quot;been concluded., nothing inthis Chapter shall he construed in or of itself to alter in any manner the rights whatsoever of any states or any peoples or the terms of existing internationalinstruments to which members may respectively beparties.2.      Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be inter-preted as giving grounds for delay or postponement ofthe negotiation and conclusion of agreements for placing mand.ated and other territories under the&apos;trusteeship system as provided for in Article 77.Paragraph 1 of this Article was inserted, largely on theinsistence of the United kingdom.om Delegation, in order tosafeguard the position of the Mandatory Power by ensuring that, unless terms of Trusteeship acceptable to theMandatory Power were agreed upon, the terras of the existingMandate would be maintained.    This&quot;was a point to which the coalition Government attached fundamental importance4&apos;.;   Whenthe time comes for His Majesty&apos;s Government formally tostate to the United nations whether or not they propose toplace any or all of their existing Mandated territories under Trusteeship, it should, in my view, be made clearthat our willingness to place any of these territories under trusteeship is subject to the conclusion in respect to that territory of a Trusteeship Agreement satisfactory to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as the MandatoryPower.5-       STATEMENTS ALREADY made it was the policy of the late Government that we should retain control of our existing Mandated territories;    andthat there should be no question of our agreeing to place under any form.of international trusteeship any of our colonial territories,  other than those now administered under Mandate/,    This policy was not publicly announced, atthe time but was referred, to in the debate in the House ofCommons on the&quot;United Nations Charter.    An extract from the speech by my predecessor, Colonel Stanley, and the reply bythe present Foreign Secretary on the question of existingMandates is attached as Annex I.    The Foreign Secretaryassured the House that, as far as the administration of our existing Mandates was concerned, there was no change ofpolicy and, that he regarded this matter as really settled.6.      FUTURE OF EXISTING ILiND^TED TERR I TORIES(a)    PalestineAt Annex II is the statement made in the House ofCommons on 13th November by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, on the subject of the Anglo-american committee of Enquiry for Palestine.    In this statement he mentioned that the enquiry would facilitate the finding ofa solution of the Arab-Jew problem which, would in its turnfacilitate the arrangements for placing Palestine under trusteeship.    It is, therefore, already understood that itis the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to placePalestine under trusteeship.+   W.M,. (k5) 61st Conclusions, paragraph 3&quot; /   W.M.(h-5j 38 and 1+2 of 3rd and 12th April-, 19k5

(-&quot;k)    Trans-Jordan..    There is, technically, only oneMandate for botTK paTestine and Trans-Jordan, some of theprovisions of which apply only to Palestine..    The positionin respect of Trans-Jordan, however, rwqulres separate consideration.    In June, 19kh, His Majesty&apos;s Government madea statement to the Trans-Jordan Government, the text of whichis in Annex III,    In this statement His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsaid that &quot;they would welcome the conclusion, of a treaty withTrans-Jordan which would conform more closely to the circumstancesof the time than does the agreement of 1928&quot; hut that the negotiation of such a treaty must he deferred till after thewar..    In November of this year, the Amir accepted an invitation to visit this country &quot;during the next few months&quot;.    The visit willnot take place until after the beginning of February 19h7.Pending the discussions with the Amir it is not possible tosay whether it will be feasible to terminate the Mandate, inrespect of Trans-Jordan and to support an application by Trans-Jordan for membership of the united Nations Organisation orwhether it will be found preferable tc maintain a quasimandatory regime and therefore to submit to the United nations organisation a draft &quot;Trusteeship Agreement&quot; in respect of trans-jordan.(c)    Tanganyika, Togoland and Caneroons. I do not thinkthat there can&apos;be any serious quest on of our not placing these territories under Trusteeship,    Any other course would, I am sure, be unacceptable internationally.7.      I ha-ce consulted the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs about Nauru.    A &quot;c&quot; Mandate for Nauru was conferred onthe British Empire.    By virtue of the Nauru island Agreementof 1923 and supplementary Agreement of 1925, between the unitedKingdom, Australia and New Zealand, the island has been and still is administered by Australia, subject to consultationwith the United Kingdom and New Zealand about the appointmentof the Administrator.    Whether or not Nauru should be placed under trusteeship should therefore depend primarily on the wishes of the Australian Government.    We suggest that, when DominionGovernments are informed of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, in regard to mandated territories under united Kingdom administration, it should be suggested to the Australian Government that, so far as theUnited Kingdom Government are concerned, we &apos; should &quot;be willingfor Nauru to be placed under Trusteeship, if the australian and New Zealand Governments agree; if they do, it would seemproper for the Australian Government to announce the intentionof the three Governments and to take the .necessary steps for the negotiation of a Trusteeship Agreement,7&apos;     Strategic Areas.&apos; When a decision has been taken which territories are tobe placed under Trusteeship, it will be necessary to considerwhether the whole,  or. any part,, of any such territory should be designated as a. strategic area.    I propose to seek the advice of the Chiefs of Staff on this point and&apos;on the militaryprovisions to be included, in the Trusteeship Agreements.8...     &quot;Procedure.If my recommendations are accepted, I suggest that anannouncement should be made (a)  stating that it is His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s policy to place Tanganyika, Garner consider and Togolandunder Trusteeship, subject to the conclusion of satisfactory

Trusteeship Agreements;  (b) inviting reference, as regardsPalestine, to the statement by the Secretary of State&apos; for ForeignAffairs on the 13th November.    I should not propose that any specific reference to Trans-Jordan should be made in thestatement but, if the matter were pressed, it would, I think,be sufficient to say that the future of Trans-Jordan was beingconsidered separately and that His Highness the Anir had accepted an invitation to cone to   London early in the Hew year for discussions.    Ho reference to Nauru need be made in theStatement.- Before,  however, such a statement is made, I should propose that the Governments of the territories concerned andthe Dominion. Governments should be informed.    It is important that we shouldbo able to make our intentions public before theFirst Part of the First Session of the General Assemlrry of theUnited Nations, at present proposed for the 10th January, 19k6,9.      Qonelus ion.I recommend, therefore(a) that a, decision should be taken to place Tanganyika,the British Cameroons and British Togeland under trusteeship, subject to the conclusion of satisfactoryTrusteeship Agreements;(b) that the Governments of the territories concerned and dominion Governments should be informed of thisdecision(c) that thereafter this decision should be announcedbefore the first meeting of the General Assembly,reference being made at the same time to the statementalready made regarding Palestine.(inltd)    G.H.H.Colonial Office,17TH DECEMBER,  1945-&apos; -a-

ANNEX IColonel Stanley:    Now under this new provision the mandates cannot be altered without the consent of thepresent mandatory power, and I believe it would givegreat reassurance in those areas if the Right Hon. Gentleman(Mr. Bevin) could confirm that His Majesty&apos;s Government haveno intention of relinquishing their mandates for those territories which they now hold.Mr. Bevin:    As far as the administration of our existing mandate is concerned, there has been no changein the policy &apos;to which we were all a party in the coalition Government.      It was thoroughly threshed out at that time.      There was no party difference about itat all,   and we arrived at a decision on this question whichI can assure my Right Honourable and Gallant Friend(Colonel Stanley) has not even been reconsidered, because we regard it as really settled.ANNEX IIPALESTINE  (ANGLO-american committee OF INQUIRY)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr.  Ernest BevinJ :    I should like, with the permission of the House,  to make a statement..His Majesty&apos;s Government have been giving serious and continuous  attention to the whole problem of the jewish community that has arisen as a result of Nazi persecutionin Germany, and. the conditions arising therefrom.      It is,unfortunately,  true that until conditions in Europe becomestable, the future of a large number of persons of manyraces, who have suffered under this persecution, cannotfinally- be determined.    The plight of the victims of Nazipersecution,  among whom were a large number of Jews,  isunprecedented in the history of the world.      His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are taking every step open to them to try toimprove the lot of these unfortunate people.      The Jewishproblem is a great human one.   . We cannot accept the viewthat the Jews should be driven out of Europe, and should notbe permitted to live again in these countries without discrimination, and contribute their ability and theirtalent towards rebuilding the prosperity of Europe.      even after we have done all we can in this respect, it does not provide a solution of the whole problem.There have recently been demands made upon us for large-scale immigration into Palestine. Palestine,  whileit may be able to make a contribution,  does not, by itself,provide sufficient opportunity for grappling with the whole problem.      His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to exploreevery possibility which will result in giving the Jews a proper opportunity for revival.

The problem of Palestine is itself a very difficult one.      The Mandate for Palestine requires the Mandatory tofacilitate Jewish immigration, and to encourage close settle-ment by Jews on the land,  while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are notprejudiced thereby.      his Majesty&apos;s Government have thus a dual obligation,  to the Jews on the one side and to theArabs on the other.      The lack of any clear definition of&quot;this dual obligation has been the main cause of the troublewhich has been experienced in Palestine during the past26 years.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have made every effort to devise some arrangements which would enable Arabs and Jews to live together in peace and to co-operate for the welfare of the country, but all such efforts have beenunavailing.      Any arrangement acceptable to one party hasbeen rejected as unacce-ptable to the other.      The vholehistory of Palestine since the Mandate was granted, has been one of continued friction between the two races, culminatingat intervals in serious disturbances.The fact has to be faced that since the introductionof the Mandate it has  been impossible to find common groundbetween the Arabs and the Jews.      The differences in religionand in language,  in cultural and social life,  in ways of thought and conduct,  are difficult to reconcile.      On theother hand, both communities lay claim to Palestine, one onthe ground of a millenium of occupation,  and the other onthe ground of historic association coupled with the under-taking given in the first world war to establish a Jewishhome.      The task that has to be accomplished now is to findmeans to reconcile these divergences.The repercussions of the conflict have spread far beyondthe small land in which it has arisen.      The Zionist causehas strong supporters in the United States,  in Great Britain,in the Dominions and elsewhere;    civilisation has been appallby the sufferings which have been inflicted in recent years on the persecuted Jews of Europe.      On the other side of the picture,  the cause of the Palestinian Arabs has been espousedby the whole Arab world and more lately has become a matterof keen interest to their 90,000,000 co-religionists in indian Palestine itself there is always the serious risk ofdisturbances on the part of one condition or the other,  andsuch disturbances are bound to find their reflection in amuch wider field.      Considerations  not only of equity and of humanity, but also of international amity and world peace,are thus involved in any search for solution.In dealing with Palestine all parties have enteredinto commitments.      There are the commitments imposed bythe Mandate itself,  and,  in addition, the various statements of policy which have   been made by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the course of the last 25 years.      Further,  theUnited States Government themselves have undertaken thatno decision should be taken in respect of what,  in theiropinion, affects the basic situation in Palestine, withoutfull consultation with both Arabs and Jews.

Having regard to the whole situation and the fact thatit has caused this world-wide  interest which affects bothArabs and Jews, His Majestyds Government decided to invitethe Government of the United States to co-operate with themin setting up a joint Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry,under a rotating chairmanship,  to examine the question ofEuropean Jewry and to make a further review of the palestine problem in the light of that examination.      I am happy to beable to inform the- House that  the Government of the UnitedStates have accepted this invitation.The terms of reference that have been agreed between theUnited States Government and His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government areas follows:(1)    To examine political, economic and social conditions of Palestine as they bear upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement therein,  and the well-being of the peoples now living therein.(2)    To examine the position of the Jews in thosecountries in Europe where they have beenthe victims of Nazi and Fascist persecutionand the practical measures taken orcontemplated to be taken in those countries,to enable them to live free from discrimination and oppression and to make estimates ofthose who wish,  or will be impelled by their conditions to migrate to Palestine, or othercountries outside Europe,(3)    To hear the view of competent witnesses andto consult representative Arabs and Jewson the problems of Palestine as such problemsare  affected by conditions subject toexamination under paragraph (1)  and (2)  above,and by other relevant facts and circumstances,and to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and to the Government of theUnited States for ad interim handling ofthose problems, as well as &quot; for their permanent solution.(d)    To make such other recommendations to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and the Government of the UnitedStates,  as may be necessary to meet thoimmediate needs arising from conditions subjectto examination under paragraph (2)  above,by remedial action in the European countriesin question,  or by the provision of facilitiesfor emigration to,  and settlement-  in, countriesout side E ur ope.Those are the terms of reference.      The procedure of theCommittee will be determined by the Committee themselves and itwill be open to them, if they think fit,  to deal simultaneously,through the medium of sub-committees, with their various termsof reference.      The Committee will be invited to deal with thematters referred to in &quot;their terms of reference with the utmostexpedition.    In complying with the second and fourth paragraphs of their terms of reference, the Committee, will presumably, take such steps as they consider necessary in order to informthemselves of the character&apos; and magnitude of the problem created by the war.      They will also give consideration to the problemof settlement in Europe,  and to possible countries of disposal.

In the light of their investigations, they will make recommendations to the two Governments for dealing v/ith theproblem in the interim until such time as a permanent solution can be submitted to the appropriate organ of theUnited Nations.The recommendations of a Committee of Inquiry such aswill now be set up, will also be of immense  help In arriving at a solution of the Palestine problem.      The committee will,in accordance with the first and third paragraphs of their terms of reference, make an examination,  on the spot, of thepolitical, economic and social conditions which are at presentheld to restrict immigration into Palestine, and, after consulting representative Arabs and Jews,  submit proposals fordealing with these problems.      It will be necessary forHis Majestyfs Government, both to take action with a view to. securing some satisfactory interim arrangements, and also to&quot;devise a policy for permanent application thereafter.    this inquiry   will facilitate the finding of a solution which will,in turn^ facilitate the arrangements for placing Palestineunder trusteeship.So far as Palestine is concerned, it will be clear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of their duties and responsibilities under the Mandate while the Mandatecontinues.      They propose, in accordance v/ith their pledges,to deal with the question in three stages:(i)    They will consult  the Arabs with a view t o anarrangement which will ens ire that pendingthe receipt   of the ad interim recommendations which the committee of Inquiry will make onthe matter there is no interruption of jewish immigration at the present monthly rate.(ii)    After considering the ad interim recommendationsof the Committee of Inquiry,  they will explore,with the parties concerned,  the possibility of devising other temporary arrangements for1dealing with the Palestine problem, until apermanent solution of it con be reached.(iii) They will prepare a permanent solution for submission to the United Nations, and ifpossible an agreed one.The House will realise that we have inherited in Palestinea most difficult legacy,  and our task is greatly complicated by undertakings given at various times  to various parties, whichwe feel ourselves bound to honour.

ANNEX IIIStatement made to Trans-Jordan Government June 19kh,&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have given earnest    andsympathetic consideration to the Memorandum from the councilof Ministers of the hth November last on the future status of Trans-Jordan.      They are highly appreciative of theunswerving friendship and support of the Government and people under the wise leadership of His Highness the Amir,and they gratefully recognise that in many critical periods of the last twenty years,  and not least during the darkestdays of the present war, they have been able unhestitatinglyto rely on the willing and active co-operation of all sections of the community in Trans-Jordan to the full extentof their powers and resources.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that itis the desire of the people of Trans-Jordan that theyshould take their place on an equal footing with the peoples of neighbouring Arab countries,  and to this endthey would welcome the conclusion of a treaty with Trans-Jordan which would conform more closely to the circumstancesof the times than does the  agreement of 1928.      Fortec hnicel reasons the negotiation of such a treaty must await the conclusion of the war.      But,  although meanwhile the formal relations between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Government of Trans-Jordan must continue as atpresent, it will be the object of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto interpret them with due regard to this intention.&quot;
