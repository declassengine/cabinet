(45) 311.28th November, 1945.CABINET.REPORT BY THE MAN-POWER COMMITTEE ON RELEASES FROMTHE FORCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. The Man-Power Committee have considered what steps should be takenby changes in the present arrangements  or releases from the Forces to alleviate the present and prospective shortages of workers in essential industries and services.2. A cceleration of Demobilisation. Thanks to the excellent response madeby the Service Departments and the Ministry of War Transport, there is every reason to hope that the target figures fixed by the Cabinet at the beginning ofOctober for releases and discharges up to the end of 1945 will be achieved, with theresult that a million and a half men and women will have been released ordischarged by the 31st December.3. By the Spring of 1946 the progress made with the reconversion of factories and the greater amount of raw materials available will make it possiblefor industry to absorb large numbers of workers, and it is most desirable that thenecessary man-power should be available to enable a powerful drive for therestoration of the export trade and of civilian standards to be started at thattime. It would, therefore, be of the greatest possible assistance if the targetreleases fixed by the Cabinet for the period up to the 30th June, 1946, could beachieved at an earlier date. The Committee have been informed by the service ministers that this should be possible and that the numbers which, according tothe plans approved by the Cabinet, were due to be released by the 30th Junewill, in fact, be released about two months earlier. Thus the high aggregate rateof release of close on 100,000 a week attained in November and December 1945will be continued during the first four months of 1946, and there is every expecta-tion that between the 1st January and 30th April, 1946, the total releases will amount to over 1,600,000. The rate of release thereafter will depend on the reviewof the military requirements at the 30th June, 1946, which is now being made bythe Chiefs of Staff, the results of which should be available in December.4. Class B Releases. The acceleration of releases in Class A will reduce theextent to which Class B releases are necessary, but the Committee have also considered the problem of securing more effective assistance to essential industries and services through Class B releases. Hitherto, the Ministry of Labour and national Service have been working on the decision that the Class B release scheme should not continue beyond the end of 1945 and that the total number of Class b releases should not exceed 10 per cent, of the 1,000,000 Class A releases originallyplanned for the period up to the end of 1945. In fact, however, owing tothe disinclination of many men to accept release in Class B, the number of releases has fallen short of this percentage, and the total up to the 31st Octoberamounts to only 38,566 as against 449,321 releases in Class A. At the sametime, the Ministry of Labour is being strongly pressed by various departments to increase the share of Class B releases allocated to particular industries and services. The Service Ministers are satisfied that, now that a rapid flow of releases in Class A is taking place, there would not be any opposition in the forces to a larger proportion of releases in Class B; and the Committee accordinglypropose that the programme of Class B releases should continue beyond the[30965]
31st December and should be planned on the basis of 15 per cent, of the 2,000,000Class A releases which will have been achieved by March 1946. Moreover, releaseshould be offered to a sufficient number of men to ensure that over any given periodof time actual releases in Class B do, in fact, amount to between 10 per cent,and 15 per cent, of Class A releases. This will entail offering Class B release toa much larger number of men than it is desired to obtain.5. It is clearly desirable that release in Class B should not be offered tomen with less than one year&apos;s service in the Forces, since it would not be worthcalling up men for such a short period of service; and we think that this principle should be accepted even though it will reduce to some extent thenumber of Class B releases achieved. It should also be realised that theextension of Class B releases is bound to result in delaying the release of menin Class A and that if anything like the full 15 per cent, were reached it wouldbe impossible for the Services to adhere to the dates already announced for the class A release of men in the various age and length of service groups.6. Continued Call-up of Men between Ages 18 and 30. The Man-power committee have considered a number of requests by Departments for the exemption from call-up to the Forces of men under 30 in particular industries which are regarded as of vital importance to the community. In particular,the Committee were informed by the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of,State for Scotland that, in his view, to apply the call-up to young men in thebuilding and building materials industries would be disastrous for the housing programme. The Committee do not minimise the difficulties with which anumber of vital industries are faced, but they regard it of paramount importanceto maintain the principle, on which the most explicit pledges have been givento the Forces, that the call-up of young men shall continue; and they aresatisfied that the proposals set out in this memorandum for the acceleration of^releases in Class A in the early months of 1946 and for increased Class b releases will more than make good any losses through the call-up. they accordingly recommend that those men in the building industry and the building materials and components industries whose call-up was postponed for a periodof six weeks at the instance of the Minister of Health and the Joint Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (M.P. (45) 12th Meeting,Minute 1) should now be called up.7. Publicity. -The Committee submit these recommendations to theCabinet as a basis for the operation of the release scheme over the period beforethe plans can be reviewed in the light of the fresh appreciation of our military commitments which is being made by the Chiefs of Staff. They suggest thatno public announcement need be made about the acceleration of Class A releasespending this review of the plans, and that if the Government are pressed tomake any statement about the period after the 31st December it would be enough to state that it was hoped to continue into 1946 the rate of releasereached in December 1945. It will, however, be essential to make a statement with regard to the changes proposed in the Class B release scheme, in order tomake the position clear to men in the Forces.E.
