EXPLANATORY AND FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM.The purpose of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to the bretton Woods Agreements if His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom decide to sign them (see Cmd. 6546 of 1944).Clause 2 (1) provides for the payment of subscriptions to &quot;theFund of approximately  325 million, and to the Bank of thesame amount. The Bank Agreement provides that, of thelatter amount, only 20 per cent., say  65 million, can be called up in the first instance. Clause 2 (1) also covers sums payable in certain contingencies, namely, a decline in the value of sterlingheld by the Fund or the Bank, the failure or default of thedepository designated by His Majesty&apos;s Government to holdassets in the United Kingdom of the Fund, and any paymentsarising on liquidation or withdrawal. These payments are tobe made out of the Consolidated Fund, and the Treasury are authorised to borrow for that purpose.Under clause 2 (2), all exchange operations between the UnitedKingdom and the International Monetary Fund will be carried outthrough the Exchange Equalisation Account, and any chargesarising out of these transactions will be borne by that Account.Subject to this, any receipts from the Fund or the Bank are payable into the Exchequer.   These cannot be estimated.Under clause 2 (4), the Treasury may create the non-interest-bearing and non-negotiable notes, etc., in which, under theAgreements, the Fund or the Bank may temporarily invest any surplus sterling in their hands.Clause 3 and the Schedule effect the non-financial changes inthe law required by the Agreements. These relate principallyto the immunities and privileges which it is prescribed that theFund, the Bank and their staffs should enjoy in the territories of Members.Original membership involves signature&apos; of the two Agree-ments before 31st December, 1945, and signature must be accompanied by the deposit of an instrument setting out thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; has accepted this Agreement inaccordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary toenable it to carry out all of its obligations under this Agreement.&quot;(See Article XX of the Fund Agreement and Article XI of theBank Agreement.) In both cases, His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom, if they sign the Agreements, will accept70 4 ABretton Woods Agreements Bill.
their provisions &quot; both on their own behalf and in respect of all their colonies, overseas territories, all territories under their protection, suzerainty or authority, and all territories in respectof which they exercise a mandate,&quot; i.e. on behalf of the wholeCommonwealth except Canada, Australia, New Zealand, SouthAfrica and India, who are entitled to be Members in their own right, and Eire, who was not a party to the Bretton WoodsConference. Accordingly, under clause 3 (2), effect is given tothe provisions in .the Schedule throughout the whole Common-wealth, with the exceptions above indicated, unless in particular cases local legislation is forthcoming. The financial obligations in regard to subscriptions, etc., concern the United Kingdomonly, and no direct financial liabilities are imposed by the Billon any Government other than His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom.
