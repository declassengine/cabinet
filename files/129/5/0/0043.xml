/i/J3.v   178(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)s,;;, C RET18TH DECEMBER. 19U5BROADCASTING POLICY:    WIRE broadcasting memorandum by Postmaster GeneralThis memorandum amplifies. CP.  (1+5) 293, paragraphs39 to 1+3, dealing with wire broadens tinge2.        In 1933, the existing licences held by the companies were renewed for a period of ten years, i,e.  until the endof 191+9.      On the outbreak of war the issue of licences for new private relay services ceased in order to conserve for war purposes the labour and materials which these services wouldhave absorbed.      The ban on the opening of new services waslifted in September of this year, but so far very fewapplications for new licences have been received, and thereare no indications that any considerable expansion is likely,so long as security of tenure beyond the end of 19h9 iswithheld.3.        In any event, renewed exposition to wire broadcasting onthe part of the wireless trade and associated interests isalready in evidence and seems likely to increase.      Thisopposition is directed against wire broadcasting as such,because it limits the demand for wireless receiving sets,irrespective of whether it is conducted by private enterpriseor by the Government.      &quot;wire broadcasting is in fact not a publicservice in itself, but a competitor of the wireless receivingset trade in providing facilities by which persons holdingwireless receiving licences can- receive programmes;    it isthe provision of programmes by the B.B.C.  which constitutes the element of public service,1+.     &apos;  The licences held by Relay Companies cannot bedetermined, in normal course before the 31st December, 19h9 j.and require a year&apos;s notice of that intention.      If theyare so determined,  the plant and equipment, or any part ofit, can be purchased by the Postmaster General at its netvalue at the time of purchase, with no allowance for lossof business, goodwill, or any other consideration whatever.Determination&apos;&quot;before the &quot;1st December, 191+9 could only been forced, by special legislation, and would require the paymentof compensation, and would thus involve paying for goodwillwhich will have disappeared by the end of 191+9.5.       Nationalisation of the Companies now would strain theresources of the Post Office.    &quot;Apart from the initialwork, much adaptation of the local Post Office organisation would be necessary to carry on the relay services.      Moreover,development of these services by the Post Office during thenext two or three years could only be effected by divertingman-power and equipment from the telephone service, which hasnearly 300,000 applicants waiting to be connected.!&apos;COPY NO.CABINET

6,       Nationalisation no&apos;.: would also moan early legislation in order to give the Postmaster General adequate powers toinstall and maintain tho Relay Companies&apos; plant in the streets.      In many towns the municipalities arc; unwillingat present to allow the introduction of relay services,and block it by refusing free war/leaves to the Companies.Other municipalities enter - for a consideration - into an agreement with one of the Companies permitting theprovision of service by very cheap methods.      ThePostmaster General has certain compulsory powers of wayleavebut they rest on out of date legislation and would be quite inadequate to enable the Post Office even to carry on theexisting relay services after nationalisation.      What wouldbe needed would be the amendment and consolidation of the telegraph Acts which date back to I863 - complicated andc ont r o v er s i a 1 1 e g i s la t i on.7.        Important technical developments in programmedistribution over linos are pending and these may withinthe next few years supersede altogether the present methodof the Relay Companies and render most of their plantworthless.      Moreover, it is impossible yet to judge howfar the wireless industry may succeed in driving relay companies out of the field by putting on the market cheaperand more efficient wireless receiving sets which enablethe listener to select a greater variety of programmes.8.        In view of the foregoing, I feel that the balance ofadvantage lies definitely in letting the situation develop,so that the Government may be in a position to review thesituation nearer the date of expiry of the Companies&apos;licences in 19I4.9 without having committed itself to thepurchase of equipment which may prove obsolescent and tothe acceleration of legislation to amend the TelegraphActs.LSt. Liartin&apos; s-1 e-grand, 3.0.1.18TE DECEMBER, 192-1-5.
