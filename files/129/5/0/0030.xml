The programme of 300,000 permanent traditional houses by the end ofJune 1947 given in my last Report (CP. (45) 274) has been further broken downas shown below for the purposes of phasing production : 1Under        Built or under &apos;By the end of  Completed.      Construction.

The figures will be revised from timeto time in the light of reports on the progress of work on the sites.Progress.3. Statistical Tables showing progress in both temporary and permanenthousing schemes between the end of July and the end of November are annexed(Table A).Permanent Traditional Houses (Local Authorities&apos; Schemes).4. Local Authorities were informed by a Circular dated the 15th November,1945, that, for the future, they should plan for larger houses, the size of thethree-bedroom house for five persons ranging from 900 to 950 sq. ft. (excludingoutbuildings) as compared with the range of from 800 to 900 sq. ft. adoptedby the Coalition Government. This will make it possible to provide a secondwater closet at ground floor level in houses with three or more bedrooms.Local Authorities have been informed that building operations should be started in all districts at the earliest possible date, even if in some cases it may at the outset only be possible to start on a small scale. The object of this policyis to establish nuclei of building work all over the country to which buildingoperatives returning from the Forces may attach themselves and organisationsengaged on new building thus be got together in all areas.[31015] B

Separate statistics for rural housing are given in Table B.1 The Minister of Works is preparing a scheme to facilitate the erection ofpermanent prefabricated houses in rural districts. The scheme will be appliedto certain forms of concrete construction which, if the concrete components aremade readily available, can be used by small local contractors with a largeproportion of unskilled labour.Private House Building.6. The number of licences issued by local authorities for the erection ofhouses by private builders of which copies had reached the Ministry of Works bythe end of October was 14,631 (218). This figure includes approximately 1,767war-destroyed houses to be rebuilt.Requisitioning.7. The number of houses held on requisition on behalf of local authorities for use as dwellings for all purposes, e.g., the homeless, war workers, or theinadequately housed, is 94,000 (1,307). The number of small houses still underrequisition in Great Britain by the Services and Government Departments (otherthan those held by the Health Departments on behalf of Local Authorities) is roughly 11,250.Emergency Scheme for Sharing Houses.&apos;. 8. This scheme was launched by a Circular to Local Authorities dated the16th November. Local Authorities were asked to organise local appeals to house-holders in their districts, making use of the assistance of local newspapers, ofposters prepared by the Ministry of Information, and of the Women:s voluntary services, who have undertaken to help, particularly in house-to-house visits.Building Materials and Components.9. A statement indicating the present rate of production of selectedmaterials and components and the labour at present employed on their production is given in Table C. In future reports, it is intended also to show the quantitiesneeded to keep pace with the housing programme so that output may be measuredagainst requirements.
Labour.10. The estimated amount of labour employed on housing schemes at the endof October, as compared with before the war, is shown in Table D. In addition toBritish labour, 17,176 German prisoners of war are at work on site development in England and Wales and 1,969 in Scotland.Release of Local Authorities&apos; Staffs.11. The present position regarding the release of local government staffs isshown in Table E.
