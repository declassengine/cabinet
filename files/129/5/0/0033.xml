3 . &amp; Am .this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTyPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 333.1th December, 1945.Copy No.    ^ cabinet.STANDING MINISTEEIAL COMMITTEES OF THE CABINET.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.IN my memorandum on Cabinet and Committee Procedure (CP.(45) 306),jlasked my colleagues to assist in relieving the strain which we have had to placeIon the policy-making organs of Government by insisting on stricter observanceI of the principles which should govern the presentation of business to the CabinetI its Committees.I have also considered whether the pressure on Ministers&apos; time could notIbe relieved by adjustments in the Standing Committee structure; and with thisjinview I have decided to make the following changes.Overseas Reconstruction Committee.2. The Far Eastern (Ministerial) Committee handles, in respect of the far east, problems similar to those dealt with, in respect of Europe, by the OverseasReconstruction Committee. We can secure economy of time and effort by com-bining the two. The Far Eastern (Ministerial) Committee will therefore be discontinued, and its work will be carried out in future by the Overseas Recon-struction Committee, which will be organised in two panels. The terms ofreference of the Committee will remain unchanged. The panel for Europeanquestions will be the existing members of the Committee, less the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for India. For far eastern questions, the following Ministers will be added -Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for[the Colonies.3. The Overseas Reconstruction (Supplies) Sub-Committee need not be[continued as a Ministerial body. Supply questions requiring decision by Ministerspan be taken by the Overseas Reconstruction Committee itself.   An official
committee will, however, be appointed (with membership corresponding to thatof its Ministerial predecessor) to deal with questions of supplies to and fromliberated and conquered areas. This official committee will report, as necessary,to the Overseas Reconstruction Committee. Its appointment will make it possibleto dispense with the Supjrties to Liberated Areas (Official) Committee and theRelief Policy Committee. The detailed arrangements will be worked out bythe Secretary of the Cabinet.4. When these changes have been carried out, the Overseas reconstruction committee will be generally responsible for supervising the work of the followingSub-Committees : Reparations Sub-Committee, Supplies (Official) Stib-Committee,Far Eastern (Official) Sub-Committee.Housing.5. I propose myself to hold periodical meetings of Ministers to review theprogress of the housing programme, and questions of major policy can be handledat those meetings.  The following Ministers will normally attend : &apos;Lord President of the Council.Lord Privy Seal.Chancellor of the Exchequer.Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Secretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production.Minister of Works.Others will be invited when subjects affecting their Departments are underdiscussion.The present Housing Committee can therefore be discontinued. The detailed work of inter-departmental co-ordination will be carried out by a committee of senior officials reporting to the Minister of Health.Storage and Disposal.6. The detailed inter-departmental work on storage and disposals is nowbeing handled by two official Committees. The Ministerial Committee on storage and Disposals can therefore be discontinued. The official Committees will reportin the first instance to the President of the Board of Trade, who has recentlyassumed a general responsibility for co-ordinating disposal policy (L.P. (45). 42nd Meeting, Minute 2). If any dispute arises which requires decision by a ministerial body, it can be referred by the President of the Board of Trade to the
141Lord President&apos;s (Industrial) Sub-Committee, to whose terms of reference thefollowing will be added : ?&apos;&apos;(d) To determine such issues as may be referred to them in connection withthe distribution and use of storage space and the disposal of surplus stores.&quot;When, under this part of its terms of reference, the Sub-Committee is considering disposal of surplus stores, the Minister of Supply and of aircraft production and the Minister of Works will be co-opted as members.Empire Telecommunications Services.7. This Committee will be discontinued. Questions of policy regarding themeans of nationalising the Telecommunications Services will be handled by theLord Presidents Committee. Detailed inter-departmental co-ordination can, ifnecessary, be entrusted to a Committee of officials reporting to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.Refugees (Reception and Accommodation).8. This Committee will be discontinued. Questions of policy will bereferred to the Cabinet or the appropriate Ministerial Committee. If there isneed for standing machinery for mter-departmental co-ordination on matters of detail, an official Committee can be appointed, which would report to the HomeSecretary.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,7th December, 1945.
