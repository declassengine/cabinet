DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   &amp; ^CP. (45) 352.31st December, 1945.CABINET.SUGGESTED INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF entrances to THE BALTIC.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith a note on this subject for the information of mycolleagues and for approval of the action suggested in paragraph 4.Note.The question of possible international arrangements for the control of theentrances to the Baltic arose in December 1941, when Generalissimo Stalin said&quot; that he would have no objection to Britain having national bases in Norwayor Denmark, but that the Soviet Union would like a guarantee by certain powers as to the entrances to the Baltic Sea.&quot; Suggestions have also been made fromtime to time, notably by President Roosevelt at the Tehran Conference in 1943,that the Kiel Canal should be separated from Germany and placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations.2. This matter did not come up at the Potsdam Conference, where it was thought the Russians might raise it; but at the recent Moscow Conference itwas taken up by M. Molotov at an informal tripartite meeting on the23rd December and by Generalissimo Stalin in conversation with me on the24th December. M. Molotov said that the war had shown the importance of the&quot; Great Belt &quot; and that the question raised larger issues than that of the controlof the waters by the riparian States. I replied that I was not prepared to discuss these wider issues at Moscow but that, in response to a previous enquiry fromM. Molotov as to the present position, I had ascertained that control was atpresent in the hands of the riparian States, as it had been for many years beforethe war without any complaint from anybody. This had meant in practice that both merchant vessels and warships of all States had been able to pass freelyin and out both in peace and war, whether neutral or belligerent. No british control was at present being exercised in those waters either directly or throughthe Danish naval authorities, although the Royal Navy were at present engagedthere in mine-sweeping operations in accordance with an international scheme in which the Soviet Union were participants.3. M. Molotov made no rejoinder to this, but on the following dayGeneralissimo Stalin expressed doubt as to whether Russian shipping was infact entitled to free passage. I replied that my information was that there was absolutely free passage and. that we hoped that now that Germany was defeatedit would be possible to establish this principle generally for ships of all nations.His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the other hand, would oppose the idea of anybases in this particular area. Generalissimo Stalin said that he did not refer to bases at all.13083   [31096]
4.   Despite the Generalissimo&apos;s reply, it appears possible that the Russians,may be angling for some sort of special position in regard to the Baltic entrances,and their continued presence on the Island of Bornholm lends colour to this.  TheUnited States Secretary of State took no part in the discussion with M. Molotovon the subject, and in view of the Soviet attitude I should be grateful (a) for approval of the line taken in my conversations with MM. Stalin andMolotov as summarised in the foregoing two paragraphs; and(b) for authority to approach the United States Government on the lines ofmy conversations with MM. Stalin and Molotov, with a view to our two Govern-ments pursuing a common line in any future discussions on this subject, and toplace on record an agreed communication to the Soviet Government.E. B.Foreign Office, 31st December, 1945.
