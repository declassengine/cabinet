THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT..Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 313.28th November, 1945.CABINET.SITUATION IN INDIA.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I attach copy of a letter I received immediately after our discussion in theCabinet on the 27th November (CM. (45) 56th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. It is from a most reliable correspondent, Shiva Rao, who is extremelymoderate in his views, and, as it answers some of the questions put during thecourse of the discussion, I thought my colleagues might care to see it.R. S. C.Board of Trade, S.W.1,28th November, 1945.Copy of a Letter dated 20th November, 1945, from B. Shiva Rao to thePresident of the Board of Trade.7 Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, India.A group of pressmen was taken to the Red Fort in Delhi yesterday to seethe I.N.A. men, both those awaiting trial and those that have been brought toDelhi as prosecution or defence witnesses. I am more than ever before convincedthat this trial is a first-class blunder. The amount of excitement that has been created all over the country, and particularly among the&quot; young, may reachdangerous proportions if these men should be found guilty and sentenced. Eyenmen in the regular army are being influenced by the&apos; trial. Travelling roundIndia, I have spoken to men in uniform who have pointed out to me the significance of the fact that so many of the Indian soldiers in Burma and Malayashould have gone over to the other side. They complain bitterly about thediscrimination shown in treatment and allowances in favour of British other ranks. This is true both of the army and the air force. The men undergoingor awaiting trial are utterly indifferent to their own fate. There is not the slightest feeling among them of Hindu and Moslem. They told us yesterdaythat in their army they had abolished all such distinctions. Hindus and Moslemshad to eat the same food cooked by -the same people and no questions were asked.The fact is receiving wide publicity. A majority of the men now awaiting trialin the Red Fort is Moslem. Some of these men are bitter that Mr. Jinnah iskeeping alive a controversy over Pakistan. The fact that Congress leaders are associated with the defence is going to prove a powerful factor in the comingelections, particularly in the Punjab.2. So far as one can see, in the Central Assembly the Congress will have about 60 seats, Moslem League about 30 and the European Group 9 or 10. these will be the three main parties. In the provinces, the Congress is certain to getmajorities in not less than 6, possibly 7 or even 8 provinces, the League may getBengal and possibly Sind, and the Unionist party will come back to power inthe Punjab with a reduced majority. At that stage I am not sure that theCongress leaders will agree to a renewed Wavell offer for the reconstitution ofthe Central Executive on the lines of his last attempt in July, unless the Labour[30970]Copy No.38
Government announces.a far-reaching policy and makes considerable alterations in the Central Executive in order to invest it with much greater power and authority than it now possesses.3. I, do not think anyone outside India can realise the indirect but powerfuleffect of the struggle in Indonesia on the national movement in this country.Every day brings fresh evidence of a revolutionary impulse sweeping over different parts of Asia. To-day it is in North Persia. The Indian press gives prominenceto the demand of the Anti-Fascist League in Burma for collective responsibility in the Burma Executive.4. I wish it were possible for a delegation from England to visit india at least to study the conditions now prevailing and the temper of the people.There is not a single element in Indian public life on whose support the BritishGovernment oan rely. Most of the Congress leaders are speaking in terms of a renewed struggle, and Nehru has frequently used the term &quot; revolution &quot; in thisconnection. The elections are no doubt keeping everybody busy, but events willmove with almost bewildering rapidity once the elections are over.(Signed) SHIVA.
