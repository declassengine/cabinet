THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945. 1 0 secret. Copy No.   3gCP. (45) 348.27th December, 1945.CABINET.WORLD WHEAT SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.THE Cereals Committee of the Combined Food Board, having reviewed theposition in the light of the latest estimates of supplies and requirements, havefully confirmed the views expressed by me in previous papers as to the gravity of the world wheat situation.2. Very briefly, the requirements of importing countries during the sixmonths from July to December 1945 will substantially be met, but for the succeed-ing six months, i.e., January to June 1946, inclusive, the claims made by importing countries amount to approximately 19 million tons of wheat and flour (wheat equivalent), while the available supply is estimated to be between 11-7 and12-3 million tons, leaving a deficiency of about 7 million. A summary of the statistical position is given in Appendix I. This does not allow for any increasein wheat requirements of rice-eating countries due to the world shortage of rice.The present estimates for 1946 indicate a shortage of between 1 million and2 million tons.3. There is little doubt but that many of the claims are inflated, partly because of the inability of claimants to import cereal feeding-stuffs and partly to offset the effect of the anticipated overall cut which many claimants no doubtbelieve will be made. But, after making full allowance for these factors, theresidue of what might be termed &quot; reasonable &quot; requirements still substantiallyexceeds the available supply.4. Little further can be done to increase supplies. Australia might be persuaded to incur the risk of increasing her wheat exports during the first half of1946, while the early despatch to the Argentine of coal and oil fuel, railway equip-ment, motor tyres and spare parts would relieve the transport position and make it possible for a limited additional quantity of grain to be exported. But the sumtotal of these two expedients would not produce more than an additional600,000 tons of wheat, making the total available supply 12 - 3 million tons duringthe first six months of next year. The United States and Canada are alreadymaking a great effort, but this will have to be intensified if these two countries areto export the quantities counted upon in the figures in this paper. In the UnitedStates, particularly, farmers are not selling their wheat freely at present theyare under no compulsion to do so and many are probably holding their wheat back for a rise in the ceiling price. Weather will also play a substantial part in the attainment of the export figure which has been allowed for. A hard winter in north America with much snow and ice would have a serious adverse effect.5. Apart from some increase in supplies from the United States which may result from the approach I propose to make to the Administration during myforthcoming visit to Washington, the only remaining method of balancing the account is to reduce requirements.6. This should be the task of the Combined Food Board acting on the advice of its Cereals Committee, but it appears from the cables which have been received that there is some reluctance on the part of the Committee to grasp the nettlefirmly. The claims put in by the different countries have been referred back totheir Governments for reconsideration.  I fear this will not result in any marked[31079] b
reduction of demand. The danger of delay lies in the fact that, pending a firmdecision as to the apportionment of the available supply, particularly from theUnited States, no claimant country can buy wheat forward and position thenecessary tonnage to lift it, since the American authorities concerned have noinstructions to issue the necessary permits. The result is that, at a time whenthe predominant consideration is to maintain the maximum flow of export wheat,quantities considerably less than the practical maximum are being shipped fromthe United States. This loss cannot subsequently be recovered, because if thetotal available supply is to be shipped the maximum export facilities will berequired in each month of the whole period, and no back-log can therefore bemade good.7. My Department have very carefully scrutinised the latest claims madeby importing countries, and, in the light of the information which is available,believe that substantial reductions in many of these claims would be possible without involving exceptional hardship. This assumes that claimants will devotetheir remaining indigenous resources so far as is necessary to direct human consumption needs, thereby making good the reduction in their import programmes. The cuts cannot be made on a scientific basis since the essentialstatistical data in regard to production, collection and usage for seed, human consumption, animal feeding and industrial purposes are not available. But evenif they were, a detailed examination of each country&apos;s claim as a preliminary todistribution of the available export supply would take far too long, and wouldresult in a substantial loss of import wheat to all claimants without compensatingadvantage.8. Since time is of the essence of the problem, I have sent a preliminarycable to the United Kingdom representative on the Combined Food Board, giving him the suggestions of my Department for reducing the requirements of thevarious claimants. An extract from the cable, giving the suggested allocationsfor the different countries during the first six months of 1946, is given inAppendix II. For purposes of comparison the latest known notified require-ments of the different countries are also given.9. The cuts in the requirements of the different claimants are necessarilysevere. Those of France and French North Africa, for instance, are reduced from 2,760,000 tons of wheat to 1,300,000 tons; U.N.R.R.A. from 2,983,000 tonsof wheat and 938,000 tons of flour to 1,300,000 tons of wheat and 200,000 tonsof flour. The requirements of the London Food Committee areas, for which thiscountry is responsible, are reduced from 3,255,000 tons of wheat and 857,000 tonsof flour to 2,637,000 tons of wheat, with an increase to 968,000 tons of flour.Owing to the limited time available my officials have not yet been able to discussthe suggested cuts with officials of the Departments. I put forward the figures in Appendix II as an indication of the scale of reductions which are inevitable.On my return from Washington we can consider the suggestions in detail, and inthe light of the new information which will then be available.10. The problem must be dealt with in two ways maximising exports from the United States (and possibly also Australia and the Argentine) and severely curtailing demands. The cuts suggested, which are on the basis of theexisting supply figures, would leave room for upward adjustments if further supplies are forthcoming.11. If claimant countries can be informed at once that they may proceedto procure and ship even a limited quantity in each of the next three months,it will be of great advantage, not only in keeping wheat moving andfacilitating the positioning of tonnage, but also in giving to claimant countries  firm basis on which to plan. At present they are completely in the dark as tothe quantities of wheat they are likely to obtain during future months.12. I have excluded Germany from the basic list of claimants to avoid any delay in programming wheat supplies for other countries, but this does not, ofcourse, prejudice the position, since the British zone requirements could be metcut of&apos; the contingency reserve of 1,644,000 tons to 2,235,000 tons included inAppendix II. The latest estimate which I have received of the requirements ofthe British zone in Germany, after taking into account the flour and barleywhich I have undertaken to provide in December and January, is a further660,000 tons of wheat between the 1st March and the 30th June, 1946. I am atpresent bound by the approval by the Lord Presidents Committee on the12th October, 1945 (L.P. (45) 37th Meeting), of the proposal set out in para-graph 19 (4) of L.P. (45) 181 that wheat and flour may be supplied to Germany,
or other ex-enemy countries, only if this can be done without any reduction in fcheexisting requirements of the United Kingdom or in the minimum needs of liberated countries for human consumption. If the British zone in Germany,or ^ tine three Western zones of Germany, are now to enjoy equality with, orpriority over, other claimants it will be necessary to amend the existing decision).I invite my colleagues to consider whether the minimum requirements of theBritish zone in Germany should be dealt with :  (i) out of the contingency reserve as a first charge;(ii) as ranking equally with those of other claimants for supplementarygrant which the C.F.B. will determine in the light of the needs ofthe different claimants;(iii) as lowest priority claimant on the contingency reserve.13. The decision regarding the disposal of . their wheat supplies will ultimately rest with the exporting countries. It is, therefore, difficult for theUnited Kingdom to intervene too openly with proposed reductions for other -claimants, who may urge that the United Kingdom has safeguarded its own position. The quantities required for the United Kingdom are, however, theminimum necessary to implement the decisions of the Cabinet regarding ourbread consumption. Those quantities will only be provided if the necessary shipping for my Canadian programme is regularly available, as my undertakingwith Canada is that any quantity which I do not lift in any month is lost tome and not replaced at a later date. I suggest that the decision regarding the curtailment of the wheat requirements of the claimant countries should rest inthe hands of the C.F.B. (which is composed of representatives of the UnitedKingdom, United States and Canada). The representatives of the three countries will, however, be guided, in so important a matter, by the instructionsthey receive from their respective Governments and I propose to discuss thematter while in Washington, with the hope of arriving at agreement to an allocation substantially on the basis of the figures set out in Appendix II.14.   I invite my colleagues to authorise me during my forthcoming visit to washington : (i) to make strong representation to the United States Government tomaximise exports by according full priority to the collection and move-ment of grain from the farm to the seaboard and by taking such steps as may be necessary, e.g., requisitioning from farmers and traders, to ensure a flow of wheat sufficient fully to take up themaximum export capacity of the United States;(ii) to discuss with the United States Government, and to secure their agree-ment to, the provision do Argentina of sufficient coal, oil fuel and motor tyres, spare parts and road vehicles to enable the argentine government to free and export the maximum quantity of grain;(iii) to secure the agreement of the United States and Canadian Govern-ments to the proposal that the responsibility of bringing the wheataccount into equilibrium shall be borne by the Combined Food Boardand that I should discuss adjustments of the kind set out inAppendix II, but with appropriate variations between different countries in the light of the latest information available.15. I recommend that the Prime Minister be invited to appeal to the PrimeMinister of Australia, or, alternatively, that an approach be made to theAustralian Government by the Secretary for the Dominions, urging that Australiashould export a substantially greater quantity of wheat in the first six monthsof 1946 than is at present contemplated.16. I will make a full report to my colleagues on my return from Washington on the whole wheat position in the light of the discussions which I shall conducton the assumption that the necessary authority requested in paragraph 14 is given.A final decision by the Cabinet on the measures to be adopted to deal with theproblem as a whole might perhaps be deferred until my colleagues have had theopportunity of considering my report on the result of my Washington visit.B.
