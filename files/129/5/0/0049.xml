THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (4S) 349.27th December, 1945.CABINET.COAL MINING INDUSTRY.NATIONAL UNION OF MINEWORKERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.I think it my duty to inform my colleagues of certain submissions recently made to me by the National Union of Mineworkers and to call attention to the implications thereof.Since the present Government took office and announced in the King&apos;s Speechits intention to nationalise the coalmining industry I have been mainly concerned(apart from the preparation of the Nationalisation Bill) with two immediateproblems, the production of more coal and the recruitment necessary to maintainadequate man-power in the industry in future years. On both these problemsI have sought the co-operation of the National Union of Mineworkers. On thefirst I have pointed out that the Government can reasonably expect a great effort on the part of the National Union of Mineworkers and the miners to produce more coal to meet current needs in support of the policy of nationalisation. Onthe second I have urged the necessity for stressing the improved position of theindustry under the existing Wage Agreement and the new prospects offered bynationalisation as regards security and general conditions so as to encourage boysand young men to enter the industry.The National Union of Mineworkers from the outset promised collaboration in increasing production and set up an organisation under Mr. Horner for thispurpose. They also undertook to deal with absenteeism through the Lodgesfollowing my decision to discontinue prosecutions. Their efforts have met withsome success in certain districts and lodges, but are far from having beenuniversally successful either in increasing production or in dealing withabsenteeism. As regards recruitment, certain miners&apos; leaders have found itdifficult to discontinue old habits of disparaging the industry in the mind of thepublic and young people by dwelling on the arduous and dangerous nature ofcoalmining and the unwillingness of miners&apos; sons to enter it.There has also been pressure from certain leaders of the National Unionof Mineworkers for the immediate introduction of a 5-day week, earlier ending of the Saturday shift, a fortnights holiday (instead of the present weeks holiday)with pay, higher rates of compensation for accidents or death. Some of theseproposals, e.g., 5-day week, require careful examination from the point of viewof their effect upon the output of coal (this is now being examined in my Depart-ment) and of their repercussions on other industries. I have made it clear thatI am not opposed in principle to the proposals put forward. I have, however,pointed out that both the National Union of Mineworkers and the Labour Partyhave always taken the view that the best conditions could not be provided for theminers under private ownership and could only be achieved as a result of nationalisation. Accordingly, I have urged that except in so far as they can bedealt with under the existing conciliation machinery of the industry and theexisting Wages Agreement which runs till 1948, they must await the results which we hope to achieve from nationalisation.At a meeting which I had with the Executive of the National Union of mineworkers on the 18th December, a number of the Members of the Executivetook the line that they would find it increasingly difficult to deal with absenteeism[31073]
and to continue the campaign for. increased production and the encouragement of recruitment to the industry unless some of their proposals were accepted atonce. They indicated that they were doubtful whether, in the absence of a prospect of some concessions in the near future, production would recover afterthe Christmas holidays. Some of them also raised the question of wages.Hitherto it had been generally accepted that the existing wage structure would continue to be governed by the Wages Agreement of 1944 which runs until 1948,but certain Members of the Executive argued that recent increases ih wagesand other concessions given to railwaymen, dockers, &amp;c.,, had disturbed the relationship previously existing between the wages and conditions of miners andthose in other industries. They said that the increased wages or holidays in these other industries had been brought about as the result of strikes or threats of strikes and that this had been noted by the miners who had hitherto not takenadvantage of the national need for coal to press their claims.The implication of what was said at the meeting on the 18th December isthat having regard to what has happened in other industries, we cannot assume that the introduction of the Coal Nationalisation Bill and the prospect of nationalisation will prevent claims being put forward, especially on such matters as increased holidays with pay, and perhaps on wages, regardless of the additional burden that might thereby be imposed upon the National Coal Board. These are,of course, matters which fall to be dealt with at present by the ordinary concilia-tion machinery of the industry and, under the present Wages Agreement, in thelast resort by arbitration, but I think my colleagues should be aware that thesematters may be put forward and pressed at a time when the Coal NationalisationBill will be passing through Parliament, and that such action may prejudice theproduction of coal before the winter is over, and also prejudice the alreadycritical recruitment position, and therefore next year&apos;s coal budget prospects.I need hardly say that I shall do everything within my power to prevent any action that is calculated to impede production or jeopardise the activities of theproposed National Coal Board.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,27th December, 1945.
