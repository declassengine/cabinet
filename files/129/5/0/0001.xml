(45) 301.24lh November, 1945.CABINET.INDIAN SITUATION.Memorandum by the Segbetary of State fob India.1. In my Memorandum CP. (45) 296 of the 22nd November, I reported theconclusions reached by the India and Burma Committee of the Cabinet on theViceroy&apos;s Memorandum which formed Annexure I to my memorandum cp. (45) 281.2. At the request of the Prime Minister I now circulate for the considerationof my colleagues a draft of the statement which the India and Burma committee recommended should be made (vide paragraphs 2 (iv) and 4 (c) of CP. (45) 296).The text of this draft has been telegraphed to the Viceroy and he has been askedto telegraph any comments he may wish to make by Tuesday morning.P.-L.India Office,24&amp;&amp; November, 1945.n QDRAFT STATEMENT.The statement made by the Viceroy of India after his return from consulta-tions with His Majesty&apos;s Government in September outlined the steps whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government propose should be taken to promote the early realisa-tion of full self-government in India.It was the necessary preliminary that elections should be held to the provin-cial legislatures and the Central Assembly in India, because it is the firmintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that decisions as to the future governanceof British India shall be taken by the directly elected representatives of theIndian people.It was announced that after the elections in India the Viceroy would holdpreparatory discussions with representatives of British India and with the indian states in order to secure the widest measure of agreement as to the method of framing a constitution. The full significance of His Majesty&apos;s governments proposals do not seem to have been properly appreciated in India and it hasbeen widely assumed that these discussions will be a fruitful source of delay.I desire to make it plain that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard not only the setting up of a constitution-making body, by which Indians will decide theirown future, and also the other proposals embodied in the announcement, asmatters of the greatest urgency.This misunderstanding has led His Majesty&apos;s Government to considerwhether the opportunities of personal contact between this country and india which have been greatly interrupted during recent years cannot now be increased.They regard it as a matter of importance that members of our own parliament should have an opportunity to meet leading political Indian personalities, to learntheir views at first hand. They would also be able to convey in person the general[30939]
wish and desire of th&amp; people of this,gauntry that India should speedily attainher full and rightful position as an independent partner State in the BritishCommonwealth and the desire of Parliament to do everything within our powerto promote the speedy attainment of that objective. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare therefore arranging for a Parliamentary Delegation to go to India, underthe auspices of the Empire Parliamentary Association. The intention is? thatthis party should leave this country as soon as possible, in view of the difficultiesof transport, it will be limited to eight in number and will be selected by theAssociation in consultation with the political parties in this country. . , ,.HFinally, his Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that the first great need of a self-governing India will be an efficient and loyal administrative staff who can give effect in a capable and practical manner to the policies of the new-Indian Government when it is set up. It would be an ill service, therefore, to a future self-governing India to permit the foundations of the State to be weakenedand the loyalty of its servants to those who are in authority to be undermined,before that new Government comes into being. The Government of India cannotdivest itself of the responsibility which rests upon it and upon all the provincial governments, of preserving law and order and of resisting any attempt to resolvethe constitutional issue by force. The realisation of full self-government canonly come by the orderly and peaceful transfer of the control of the machineryof the State to purely Indian authority. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not permit any attempt to be made to break down the loyalty of the administrative services or the Indian Armed Forces, and they will give full support to theGovernments in India in securing that their&apos; servants are protected in the performance of their duty and that the future constitution of India shall becalled into being not by force or the threat of force but by constitutional means&quot;alone.
