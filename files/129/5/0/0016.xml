THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITftNNIC MflJESTVS GOVERNMENTANNEX I.REPORT BY THE LORD PRESIDENT.Prime Minister.1. At the meeting of Ministers on the 3rd October (Gen. 85/2nd Meeting),I was invited to review, in consultation with the Minister of Information, thetechnical publicity services which ought to be continued in peace, and to submit a report to you, clarifying the issues involved and recommending how government publicity services as a whole should be organised if the Ministry of Informationwere abolished. This was to be prepared in the light of the plan for theco-ordinated handling of news publicity to overseas countries which the foreign secretary, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, was asked at thesame meeting to work out, and of the discussions hitherto held.2. I append the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report. This has been of the greatestassistance to me in preparing this memorandum, and while there are naturallysome points of detail which I should have preferred to deal with differently, Ithink that there is only one point which I need mention specially. Paragraph 10of the Report expresses the opinion that no separate public relations organisationoverseas will be required for dealing with our commercial and economic publicityexcept in one or two particularly important posts, e.g., the United States, butI do not think that this goes far enough. Commercial and economic publicitypolicy cannot, of course, be divorced from publicity policy generally, and I agreethat the Head of the Mission must exercise a final and general responsibility forthe various local representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government. But the reasons which call for specialist commercial publicity officers in, for example, the UnitedStates apply in greater or lesser degree to other countries, and commercial public relations are, in my view, so important that I think that we should be preparedfor special arrangements of this kind in a number of countries. The difference is perhaps one largely of emphasis, but it is, in my judgment, important that,when the details of the new organisation are being worked out, the bias shouldbe in the direction of providing for such specialist officers in all cases in whichthe volume of work is likely to be such as to justify the appointment.The issues involved.3. The previous discussions have gone a long way to clear up the mostimportant issues, and I think that there is general agreement on the followingpropositions : *(a) Overseas publicity must be continued in peace time.(b) Subject to vigilance against abuse by the Government of the day, pro-vision must be made for the continuance of Government information and publicity services at home.(c) The Minister concerned should be responsible for the publicity of his department, and Departmental Public Relations or InformationDivisions, whose staffs should be strictly limited in numbers but shouldbe of good status and quality, should continue as the primary instru-ment for Departmental publicity and for keeping Ministers and departments in touch with, public opinion.(d) There should be a single organisation a Central Information Office, asI would suggest that it should be called to carry out centrally certaincommon technical and production functions and making specialist services available to Departments. This Office should be available both for overseas and home purposes. It should not be under close day-to-day direction of a Minister appointed exclusively for the purpose,though there would have to be a responsible Minister to whom theOffice could go for guidance as and Avhen required.(e) There should be machinery for the co-ordination of both overseas and home publicity, so that the different Departments concerned with over-seas publicity present a &quot; common line,&quot; which, where necessary, is related to home publicity, and so that, as far as possible, publicity at
home is consistent and overlapping and conflict are avoided. Thehome Departments must ciearly make their contribution to the pre-sentation abroad of the British way of life and British institutions.(/) For political as well as financial reasons, there should be a substantial reduction in the total Government expenditure on different kinds of publicity.4.   The main issues with which we are left are, I think :  (a) What should be the functions of the central publicity organisation orCentral Information Office?(b) What should be the nature of the co-ordinating machinery referred to inparagraph 3 (e) above ?(a) To what Minister should the ultimate responsibility for the centralpublicity organisation be assigned?Functions of the Central Information Office.5. The most convenient approach to question (a) the functions of thecentral publicity organisation may be to consider which of the existing functionsof the Ministry of Information would be more appropriate to such a central organisation than to the individual Departments, and I have had the advantageof a useful discussion with the Minister of Information and the Director-Generaland Controllers of the Ministry, in which they explained the existing organisation to me. I append (Annex B) a note describing this organisation in case you wish,to refer to it.6. Without committing myself to the details, which would have to be worked out, it is clear, I think, that the Central Information Office woulddischarge functions as regards press and poster advertising exhibitions, photo-graphs, publications and films similar to those of the Ministry of Informationbut on a considerably reduced scale. It would be convenient, too, that it shouldtake over the News Divisions function of acting as a central channel for theissue of Government news. On the overseas side, apart from any officers servingoverseas (see paragraph 7) there would have to be a central staff with experiencegenerally in this field, but this should be quite small and non-specialist. It isimportant, indeed, that in the establishment of the Central Information Officethere should throughout be the most rigorous pruning of staff, and that it shouldbe clearly understood from the outset that any tendency to undue elaborationor extravagance on the part of the new Office will be checked. On the other hand,it is desirable both on grounds of economy and of policy to avoid duplication andfragmentation amongst different Departments of staffs performing services whichcould be more efficiently done on a common basis. In such eases the right coursewould be to centralise the officers concerned at the Central Information Officerather than to distribute them through the user Departments.7. A Central Information Office organised on these lines would be a meansof providing with the maximum economy and efficiency common technical services in supplementation of Departmental resources. In the case, of some Departments,however, where a separate Departmental Information Division could not bejustified or only a small one existed, the Office might act for them, and it might also be found that, where a Regional organisation was. desirable and separateDepartmental Regional Offices would be uneconomical, Regional Offices of theCentral Information Office could act as the agents of a number of Departments,large as well as small. Officers of the Central Information Office would beattached where necessary to overseas posts, each case being decided on its merits.8. But, as I am glad to see the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report points out, theCentral Information-Office should be more than a technical adjunct to Depart-mental Information Divisions and the agent for other Departments in fieldswhich they cannot cover themselves. It should be &quot; an organisation with ideas,&quot;under a Director of first-class calibre, and staffed to quote his report again by &quot;people of lively imagination and high technical competence,&quot; who will be encouraged to display initiative. I would add that there should be ampleprovision for interchange between Departmental staffs and the staff of the central office. If these conditions are fulfilled, the Office can be an instrument forinfusing vitality into the Governments information services as a whole, and canexercise that -best kind of co-ordination, derived from the recognition of the positive contribution which thanks to its technical resources and its width of
experience and outlook it is in a position to make to policy as well as to executive action. Departmental Information Divisions also should be staffed with people,of ideas and initiative, and it is, in particular, important that the head, of the division should be of first-rate quality, and that it should be recognised that heshould have access to his Permanent Secretary and, where necessary, the minister himself. These men cannot do their work properly if they are kept out of .allpolicy-making discussions and deprived of any real contact with, their Ministerand the principal administrative officers of their Department. It should always be remembered that they have a double function interpretation of the Depart-ment to the public and, no less important, the interpretation of public feelingto the Department, both in advance of and after decisions on policy.9. I agree with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report that before the organisationof the Central Information Office is finally, settled the user Departments shouldbe given the opportunity of stating their detailed requirements..Machinery of Co-ordination.10. An effective Central Information Office, for the reasons I have given and as the Foreign Secretary &apos;s Report recognises, will be a valuable instrument of co-ordination at what I may call the technical level. As regards policyco-ordination, the suggestion in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report is that for overseaspublicity there should be a Committee of the Ministers departmentally concernedunder the chairmanship of the Minister without Departmental responsibilities and that there should be a corresponding Official Committee. I think that thisproposal is right, and that these Overseas Publicity Committees should have theircounterparts on the home side. A committee of all the Ministers concerned with home publicity would, however, be unwieldy, and it would be necessary to restrict the membership, with the usual proviso that any Minister could attend a meetingat which matters directly affecting his Department would arise. There would clearly be advantages in having the same Chairman as for the Overseas PublicityCommittee, and in case of need the two Committees could meet together. Acommon Chairmanship would obviate the necessity for any further machinery forthe co-ordination of overseas and home publicity below the Cabinet itself for major questions of policy.Ministerial Responsibility for the Central Information Office.11. As I have said, it seems to be agreed that the Central Information office should not be under the close day to day direction of a Minister, appointed exclu-sively for the purpose.12. There is no Department to which it would obviously be appropriate to attach an Office of this kind. The Treasury, the Ministry of Supply and thePost Office have been mentioned, but in each case the connection with the Depart-ment would be artificial, and I do not think that it would be desirable that thecentral agency should be under any department which has a public relationsbranch of its own. * This would make for difficulties both within that department and with other Departments. The alternative, which seems to me preferable,is to make the Central Information Office a separate Department, with a Vote ofits own : the answerability to Parliament would be on minor and technical mattersonly, since publicity policy would be answered for by each Minister in his ownsphere : the responsibility for answering to Parliament would, as in other similarcase, rest with Treasury Ministers, but this would not. of course, place theorganisation under the Treasury itself (except to the extent that any spendingDepartment is subject to Treasury control). The non-departmental Ministerdesignated as Chairman of the Ministerial Committees referred to above wouldmake it his particular concern to ensure that the organisation was efficientlymanaged, but he would not appear before Parliament in that guise.Cost of Government Publicity Services.13. In 1944-45 the estimated expenditure of the Ministry of Informationalone was  9,715,000. The estimate of total gross expenditure on the Ministry&apos;sVote is put at the annual rate of nearly  6 millions in the early months of1946. To this formidable figure has to be added the substantial expenditure onDepartmental public relations and in connection with overseas broadcasting and the expenditure, amounting to about  3,500,000 in 1944-45, on the british council.
14. I am convinced of the importance of the right kind of government publicity and I should be the last to wish to stint it. But I think that I should draw attention again to the necessity of drastic cuts in the existing expenditure.;Departments, somewhat belatedly it is true, have become alive to the value of publicity. This is all to the good, but the natural tendency to extravagancein this particular field must be checked, and, in particular, the Treasury shouldbe on guard against the multiplication of services which can most economicallybe carried out by the Central Information Office. As between the Ministryof Information and the British Council at present, for example, there is con-siderable overlapping, e.g., as regards publications, films, exhibitions, andphotographs. Thus, I am told, the Ministry and the Council have producedbooklets on the same subjects, both are taking large-scale feature sets of photo-graphs of British industries, and in exhibitions both have covered town planning and other reconstruction subjects.A sense of proportion must be kept, the total expenditure on informationmust be properly related to Government peace-time expenditure as a whole, andthe limits to public tolerance to activities which the Opposition will be onlytoo ready to exploit as calculated to boost individual Ministers or the Govern-ment as such must always be borne in mind.Summary of Recommendations.15. My recommendations for the future organisation of government publicity services as a whole may be summarised as follows : (a) Departmental Ministers should continue to be responsible for the public relations policy of their Departments, and the primary channel forDepartmental publicity should be the Departmental Public RelationsDivisions, which should, I suggest, be renamed InformationDivisions.(b) There should be a central publicity unit I have called it &quot; the CentralInformation Office &quot;-providing specialist services and performingcommon technical functions for the Departments. It should be an organisation with ideas and a positive contribution of its own tomake. It should have a first class Director and under him a staffwith imagination and high technical competence.(c) Co-ordination of policy should be provided by Committees of ministers for overseas and home publicity respectively, where necessary holdingjoint meetings, and with a common Chairman who should be a minister without Departmental responsibilities. These ministerial committees should have their official counterparts.id) The Central Information Office should not be under close day to dayMinisterial direction but should be the general responsibility of anon-Departmental Minister, who would presumably be the MinisterialChairman of the Cabinet Committees referred to under (c).(e) There should be a drastic overhaul of Government expenditure on different forms of publicity with a view to substantial reductions in the present outlay.H.

ANNEX II.CO-ORDINATION OF OVERSEAS PUBLICITY.Note by the Foreign Secretary.AT the meeting of Ministers held on the 3rd October (GEN. 35/2nd meeting)I was invited&apos;&apos; to work out, in consultation with the other overseas Ministers and withthe President of the Board of Trade, a plan for the co-ordinated handling of news publicity to overseas countries; and to communicate it to theLord President of the Council.&quot;2. I have consulted my colleagues, and the following paper represents ouragreed recommendations. It is based on the assumption that the Ministry of;Information is to be brought to an end, but that a central Government Informa-tion Agency as envisaged in the report of the Machinery of Government Committeewill be established. I must point out that if the Ministry were to be kept inexistence there would still be need for closer co-ordination than has hithertoexisted, to ensure a closer relationship between policy and publicity, as well asachieve greater consistency in the overseas output. The mere continuation ofthe Ministry would not, in my view, provide for this; and I wish to make it quite clear that the proposals which are now put forward have in my opinion veryconsiderable positive advantages over the retention of the Ministry. the secretaries of State for the Colonies, India and Burma and the President of theBoard of Trade agree generally with my views. The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on the other hand wishes it understood that in his view allthe advantage, from the standpoint of both economy and efficiency, lies in theretention of a separate information department, preferably, though not neces-sarily, under a Minister of Information. He fears that the departmental separa-tion of the producers of material from the organisation which controls policymay result in the material produced being of a lower quality and less well adapted to the needs of the user than is at present the case.3. This paper does not discuss the part of the work which is of the mostvital importance, that which is done overseas. It is concerned with action at thecentre, where co-ordination of overseas publicity must take place. The over-riding importance of co-ordination at the outposts must not be forgotten; andto-day (except in the Dominions) that co-ordination is inadequate mainly because there is more than one source of policy and direction. It is a fundamentalprinciple that public relations, to be effective, must be closely related to the making of policy.4. One of the most important functions of a public relations officer, either at home or abroad, is to give advice about the effect a proposed course of action is likely to have on public opinion, and to make suggestions concerning its timing and the method of its presentation, in order to ensure its success. This advicemay not always be acceptable, for other considerations than the reaction of thepublic may be of overriding importance; but it should always be available atthe time when policy is being formed, and should be taken into account atthat stage.5. One of the most important responsibilities of a public relations officeroverseas is therefore to be fully informed about the movements of opinion in thecountry in which he is stationed, and to provide that information, in convenientform, to the head of his mission, who must finally be responsible for any advice which is given, and through him to the responsible Department of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.6. The same considerations apply with even greater force to the positivepublicity aspects of the work of the public relations officer. It is of the first importance that British representatives abroad shall speak with one voice, andit is clear that the head of the mission must be finally responsible for positive action in presenting Britain and the British case in the country to which he isaccredited.   He himself, and all his subordinates who have a representative
function, have a direct concern with action of this kind, and it is therefore important that the activities of the public relations officer shall be closely co-ordinated with theirs. Since the responsibilities of the Head of mission and his public relations adviser in these two respects cannot be separated, it is essentialthat the latter should be fully responsible to the former.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.Report.At the Ministerial meeting of the 18th September (GEN 85/ 1st meeting) theco-ordination of publicity for overseas countries is first of all a matter of ensuring that a complete and consistent picture of Britain is presented everywhere abroad.This requires broad decisions of policy, which should be fairly easy to secureunder the machinery suggested at that meeting. The decisions of policy thusreached would be executed by each of the overseas Departments in its own sphere,just as the Ministers and Departments concerned are responsible for executingthe Foreign, Colonial or Indian policies decided by the Cabinet.2. We are therefore of the opinion that it would be advantageous toestablish a committee of Ministers representing the Foreign, Colonial, India,Burma and Dominions Offices, and the Board of Trade, together with the Treasury,under the Chairmanship of a Minister without departmental responsibilities, toundertake the necessary policy direction. The Committee should meetperiodically, as seems necessary, and probably monthly to begin with, to takestock of developments. It should also meet on any occasion when a Minister hasa question of policy to raise, or when an issue has arisen which is not capable of settlement at the official level.3. In order to provide for more continuous and close liaison in regard to the content and materials of publicity, to exchange information about the kinds of publicity needed in the interests of policy, to prevent overlapping action, and toco-ordinate the guidance to be given to posts abroad and to the British Broad-casting Corporation and other bodies which disseminate British publicity abroadfrom this country, there should be regular meetings of the officers in charge of publicity of the Overseas Departments and of the Board of Trade with representa-tives of the Treasury and the Government Information Agency and the public relations Officer to the Prime Minister, under the chairmanship of the ForeignOffice Under-Secretary in charge of publicity. We suggest that this Committeeshould meet weekly, until experience show-s how often meetings are needed.These Public Relations officers should also, as a matter of course, keep in day today touch with one another and the Government Information Agency as occasion arises.4. The Ministerial Committee would need secretarial assistance and shouldbe served by an individual member or section of the Cabinet Secretariat which^ould also provide the Secretariat for the official committee. This would not onlycreate a permanent link between the ministerial and official committees, but wouldprovide a single point for the reception of suggestions concerning the inter-relationship of home and overseas publicity, and for policy questions relating to overseas publicity about home aflairs.5. Although there must be close liaison between the overseas departments and the Board of Trade, and other Departments where necessary, it is important,that official or semi-official organisations like the British Council, the british broadcasting Corporation and the Travel Association, which undertake one form or another of British national publicity to overseas countries, shouldreceive guidance and information directly from the overseas Department whichis primarily responsible. It is therefore not proposed that any special jointmachinery should be created for dealing with these organisations; but due carewill be taken, through the use of the liaison committee referred to above, toavoid conflicting action. The broad decisions of policy reached by the ministerial committee, affecting overseas publicity generally, would naturally be passed onto the British Broadcasting Corporation and other organisations in whateverform was appropriate. The special considerations affecting the British council are referred to in a later paragraph.
6, The requirements of Departments for finished materials of publicitylike films, photographs, exhibitions and printed matter will be met by the Govern-&apos;ment Information Agency. It will nevertheless be necessary for the overseas departments themselves to provide for their posts abroad a supply of. informa-tion in various forms including a daily cabled or wireless service of guidance and information. It is important that such a service should be prepared under close supervision to ensure that it is in accord with current policy, and the needsvary not only between Empire and foreign countries, but between one foreign country and another. Nevertheless, it is evident that there will be importantelements of the service, such as texts of official statements, or summaries ofParliamentary proceedings, which are of equal utility in many Empire andforeign countries, and it is therefore proposed that the Foreign Office as thelargest user should undertake to prepare and arrange to transmit these as acommon service, leaving&apos; to the other Departments the provision of specialguidance and information appropriate to the territories with which they areconcerned. This represents a reversion to pre-war practice, when the BritishOfficial Wireless Service, prepared by the Foreign Office, was largely used in theDominions and Colonies.7. Although the scope and organisation of the Government InformationAgency is being reported on separately, we wish to emphasise our hope that itwill be staffed by people of lively imagination and intelligence and high technicalcompetence, and that they will be encouraged to display initiative. The quality of the finished materials of publicity to which we have referred above will be greatly dependent on this, and in order to do effective work abroad we shall want the very best materials. While, therefore, the Overseas Departments must be ina position to tell the technical organisation of their requirements, and to lay down the subject matter and general content and objective of a film, a pamphletor a series of posters, it must be open to the technical agency to make suggestionsconcerning the suitability of the medium chosen for the purpose in hand, andto give the appropriate technical advice on its treatment. It should be, in short,an organisation with ideas. We have assumed that before the organisation ofthe Government Information Agency is finally settled the user departments will be given an opportunity of describing their requirements.8. In addition to the telegraphic service mentioned above, and to the finishedmaterials of publicity prepared by the technical agency, the Overseas departments will each wish themselves to prepare information in other forms specially adapted for use overseas. These may include, for example, articles suitable for repro-duction in the local press, or compilations of facts in a foreign or Empirelanguage, or in English, suitable for the guidance of journalists, broadcastersand lecturers. The needs of various parts of the world in this respect varyenormously, so that many of these documents will probably not be of generaluse; and the Departments must themselves supply the necessary expert knowledgeof local conditions in the countries with which they are concerned. When theyare printed the work will usually be done by the central agency, which should beable to point out any overlapping of orders from Government Departments, butin many instances reproduction may be in typed or duplicated form. It istherefore proposed that in order to avoid any danger of overlapping the overseas department should keep each other informed of the preparation of all such documents, and supply copies as needed by other Departments.9. In view of the vital importance of our foreign trade, which will be greater than at any time before in our history, publicity for the promotion ofBritish trade and industry (including, inter alia, the stimulation of tourist tradeto the United Kingdom) will require special attention. It will be necessary toundertake not only specific publicity to bring before the people of overseas countries the advantages of trade with Britain, the achievements of Britishindustry and science, and the goods which we have to offer, but also special measures to secure a better understanding in Overseas countries of Britain5scommercial and economic policy. In other words, our objective should be tobuild up a sympathetic attitude towrards the commercial and economic policy of britain, as the worlcVs greatest trading nation, as well as specifically &quot; to push &quot;British goods.10. The Publicity Officers at posts abroad will be at the disposal of their colleagues of the Commercial Diplomatic and Consular (and Trade Commissioner)Services for these purposes and it will be one of their specific duties to undertake
such public relations and publicity activities! Special publicity officers will, how-ever, be required in one or two particularly important posts, e.g., the UnitedStates, but apart from these exceptional eases no separate public relationsorganisation overseas will be required for dealing with our commercial andeconomic publicity.11. So far as co-ordination in London is concerned, it will be for the Boardof Trade (and for the Department of Overseas Trade), working in close con-junction with the Treasury where necessary, to indicate the general lines whichshould be followed in our commercial, economic and industrial publicity and toprovide, either directly or through the Central Production Agency, such back-ground and other publicity material as may be required for use overseas. Thenecessary co-ordination of commercial and economic with political objectives willbe secured through the regular meetings of Public Relations Officers proposed inparagraph 3, and, where necessary, at meetings of the Interdepartmental Com-mittee of Ministers proposed in paragraph 2. The meetings of Public RelationsOfficers will also provide a convenient form for the interchange of views at whichthe other Overseas Departments may themselves, as a result of their knowledge of conditions in overseas countries, desire to propose public relations and publicityactivities to the Board of Trade.12. Although the British Council does not and will not normally concern itself with the political aspects of publicity or with the direct promotion ofTrade, there are many ways in which its work impinges on or overlaps with what has been called &quot; news publicity &quot; and trade promotion. For example, it issuesbooks and pamphlets and films which are clearly designed to encourage visitors to come to this country, it issues articles for the foreign and colonial press, andother publications, designed to promote appreciation of British scientific andindustrial progress, it concerns itself with many aspects of social progress, andso forth. It is clearly desirable that the Council&apos;s activities should not eitheroverlap or conflict with those of the overseas Departments on the publicity side,and it is therefore proposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as theMinister primarily concerned, to bring the Council more closely under his ownsupervision. His intention is to make its employees public servants under hisdirect control; but in drawing up his plans for the reorganisation of the Councilhe will bear in mind that it may be inadvisable to integrate too closely theCouncil&apos;s offices in the field with the Diplomatic Missions. In these circumstances the Foreign Office Under-Secretary in charge of publicity matters would be made responsible for the co-ordination of its work with that of the Foreign Officeand other Departments. The Council&apos;s work in the Colonies is already paid for from the Colonial Office vote, and is done on an agency basis under ColonialOffice supervision. This arrangement would be maintained. The Council&apos;s workin the Dominions and India is at present on so small a scale as to involve little difficulty in regard to co-ordination.  It is paid for on the Foreign Office vote.
ANNEX III.CO-ORDINATION OF OVERSEAS PUBLICITY.Note by the Minister of Information on the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign affairs. The Foreign Office plan for the co-ordinated handling of overseaspublicity is based on two assumptions. First, that the Ministry of information will not continue. Second, that a Government Information Agency will service the overseas Ministries with publicity material just as adequately as if theMinistry remained in being.2. These assumptions vitiate the whole plan. Even if the Ministry ofInformation is not retained in its present form, it does not follow that the presentunitary organisation of overseas publicity should be scrapped; and I am convincedthat the scheme for a Government Information Agency will prove in practice tobe unworkable.3. In my view overseas publicity can be effectively conducted only by a unitary organisation in which the three essential partners in any publicityoperation (the planners, the producers, and the staff abroad) work undersingle direction, as now. The Foreign Office paper suggests that results asgood, indeed better, will be achieved if the four overseas Ministries take overseparate control of publiciy as a subsidiary to their political activities, eachproviding its own specialised &apos;&apos; news &apos;&apos; service, but drawing on the ForeignOffice for common &quot; news &quot; material and on the &quot; common service &quot; agency forall other publicity matter. Behind these conceptions there lies a basicallydifferent interpretation of the nature of overseas publicity as such, and a basicallydifferent assessment of its importance.4. The Foreign Office regards publicity as a branch of foreign policy, andtherefore properly to be relegated to the status of a branch activity of the ForeignOffice, with corresponding arrangements in the three other Ministries dealingpolitically with overseas affairs. I contend that overseas publicity is a functionand interest of the Government as a whole, and that its size and complexityrequire a Department in its own right. It was presumably because the Govern-ment took this latter view that it created the Ministry in 1939 and charged it with the task of organising overseas publicity on an international scale for thefirst time. This was for war purposes, but I can see nothing in present-dayconditions which makes this form of organisation less necessary now. Moreover,the whole of our war-time experience has shown that efficiency as well as economyhas been best served by bringing together planning, production and execution,and has been most hindered where these functions have been shared between a variety of Departments and organisations.5. Of all the proposals made for the future of British overseas publicity,the Foreign Office plan bears the least resemblance to a unitary organisation;and if for the moment it be conceded that a, unitary organisation is right, then it would seem that this scheme could hardly be more wrong. It sub-divides the planning staff and the overseas staff into four, so that there comes into existenceone group of officials responsible for publicity to foreign countries, another for publicity to the Dominions, another for the Colonies, and another for India. it then sub-divides the producing staff into two, separating the producers of guidance, &quot;news,&quot; articles and reference material from the producers of books,magazines, films, photographs and exhibitions. The first of these two producinggroups it then sub-divides into four, linking up each of the segments with thecorresponding segments of the planning staff, thus bringing into existence fourseparate groups of producers of similar material. Finally, it divides the secondgroup of producers from the planners and the overseas staff altogether. Thetotal British publicity staff now working under one Minister would be disposedunder five.6. Whatever plan will work this one will not; and any one of the various proposals that maintain a unitary organisation or an approximation to it (evenif that organisation is not the Ministry as it stands to-day) is preferable to it.It represents a policy of maximum fragmentation; and in my view it will failin five separate ways :-(a) It will fail to secure the economic telling of a coherent story.(b) The separate parts will not be large enough or strong enough to masterand keep moving what is, when all is said and done, an exceedingly difficult and complicated operation.
(c) It will prevent the development of the necessary mutual understanding between the planners of policy and the producers of material.(d) For the above reasons and because of the relative smallness of each of the separate groups, the work will not attract men of the first ability.(e) It will not allow the emergence of a publicity &apos;&apos; General Staff &quot; to beenlisted in the service of British publicity everywhere.7. It is true that the Foreign Office plan seeks to overcome this fragmenta-lion by proposing that a general direction should be given to the work by two committees, one of Ministers and one of officials. But such committees could not hope to achieve more than the elimination of the worst overlaps. They could hardly hope to weld into one organisation five executive elements which it isspecifically intended should be separate. The Foreign Office paper also expressesdie hope that the central production agency will be staffed by men of ideas and ability. But since its limitations will deny them a career in a fully unitedInformation Service, it will not, I am sure, secure them.8. For these reasons I conclude that any plan such as the Foreign Officeproposes, under which there would be relatively small compartments of publicitystaff, separated both by the territories and the media allocated to them, wouldlack central drive, be slow in execution, and disappointingly sparse and poor in output. But I do not claim that the maintenance of the status quo is the only way of avoiding these results. Indeed, the issue is not fundamentally betweenthe Ministry and the Foreign Office schemes as such, but whether there is or isnot to be something that is recognisably a United Kingdom Information Service^,based firmly on the unitary principle, and offering a full career to its staff,whatever its exact name or Ministerial attribution. Shaped as it is by the trialsand experience of six years, I naturally regard the Ministry itself as the bestanswer to the Governments needs, though I have suggested that still furtherrecognition might be given to the unitary principle in the Ministry&apos;s relationswith the British Council and in its work in the Empire overseas. But much morefruitful than the Foreign Office scheme, in my view, is any variation on theunitary theme : the reconstitution of the Ministry as a department of overseaspublicity without Ministerial status; or the transference of the main work tothe British Council, with only guidance on current political issues originatingfrom the overseas Ministries; or even full assumption by the Foreign Office, asthe largest of the overseas Ministries, of the full responsibility for the main-tenance of the United Kingdom Information Service.9. Since so few would deny the advantages of a unitary organisation, if itis attainable, why is it that the Foreign Office proposals reject it ? The reasongiven is that publicity is an instrument of policy and cannot be kept in step with it unless both in London and overseas the publicity staff is attached to theappropriate overseas Ministry. The first answer to this argument is best putin the form of a question. Is it in fact possible to give one single instance ofany importance, drawn from any country during the last six years, where publicityhas been out of step with policy ? I do not know of any such instance. If therehave been such, I think they should be produced. The second answer goes deeperand back to an earlier point. British publicity overseas reflects the policy of theGovernment as a whole and not its foreign policy alone. Much the greater partof the subject matter of British publicity is the total British way of life, andin projecting this there is not the least likelihood of conflict with foreign policy as such. Nor is this subject matter domestically that of the Foreign Office. Itlies almost exclusively in the field of the Home Departments. When foreign policybecomes the subject of publicity, it is, of course, entirely conceded that directionmust be given by, and accepted from, the Foreign Office. This has, in fact, beenthe unbroken practice of the last six years and nothing in the Ministry&apos;s proposalsfor the future would modify it.E. J. W.Ministry of Information, 13th November, 1945.
ANNEX  IV.POST-WAR ORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICITY.   &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Information.1. A decision is urgently required on the post-war organisation of Govern-ment publicity at home and abroad. Otherwise there will be growing overlappingand confusion between Departments, forward planning will be impossible and weshall be unable to retain much longer the key staff still left in the Ministry ofInformation.2. It is submitted that the continuance of the Ministry of Information withits own staff at home and overseas is the most effective and economical methodof maintaining the necessary standard of Government publicity in this countryand abroad.3. The Coalition Government and its successor left this matter in the air.It was, however, laid down by the late Prime Minister in March 1945 as &quot;an assumption for planning purposes &apos;&apos; that the Ministry of Information would disappear at the end of the war against Japan; after which each department would become responsible for publicity policy in its own sphere; certain technicalfunctions of the Ministry, e.g., photography and films, being organised in aGovernment Information Agency as a common service at the disposal of all departments.4. This planning assumption was based on a report of August 1944 by the ministerial Committee on the Machinery of Government (W.P. (44) 482) whichitself derived from the report of an official Committee (M.G.O. 47) in April 1944.It is apparent from these discussions that the continuance of the Ministry ofInformation was ruled out largely for political reasons. The official committeeprefaced their scheme for the formation of a Government Information Agencyby stating &quot; despite probable political objections, there is a strong case, which meritsserious consideration by Ministers, for retaining the Ministry of Informationpermanently for the purposes of publicity both at home and overseas. If this were done, none of the machinery difficulties considered above would, ofcourse, arise.&quot;5. The political objection is that under Party Government it is wrong forthe party in power to use the taxpayers&apos; money to persuade the voter to adhere to the party line in matters of political controversy. But this does not preclude the Government of the day from explaining to the public at home the factualbackground of the national and international issues which Government policy has to face, nor from making known and understood those measures which flow from accepted Government policy. The line may not always be easy to draw and opposition criticism is certain if it is overstepped. But if it is right to provide an information service at home as a means towards the proper working of a democratic community then the fear of opposition criticism should not stand inthe way.6. It is clear, however, that there is a political responsibility to be faced.If the Government retains the machinery of the Ministry of Information in thehome field to deal with reconstruction issues through films, speakers and otherpublicity media, then the department cannot function as a common service on anon-controversial basis, but must have a responsible Minister to answer for it inParliament.7. The political objections to the continuance of the Ministry of Informa-tion may have loomed rather larger than they deserved. A stronger argument,which arises particularly in the case of the overseas departments, is that publicity to their territories is an integral part of their responsibilities and should be under their direct control. To carry out the planning assumption, the ForeignOffice, for example, would form its own Foreign Publicity Department at homeand would take over the Press Attaches and their staffs overseas who now operate as staff of the Ministry of Information, though subject to the local authorityof the Ambassador or Minister. This course has certain advantages. the publicity activities and the staffs engaged in them would gain in status by beingincorporated in one of the major departments of State : and the staff would
have the opportunity of a career in the Foreign Service. The iniiux of officialsalive to the importance of publicity would help to make the whole service publicity-minded. In the case of the Foreign Office there would also be the advantage ofco-ordination between publicity proper and the activities in foreign territories of the British Council which are under Foreign Office control.8. On the other hand, there has been no serious difficulty in practice in the relationship between the Ministry of Information and the overseas departments.Conformity with the general line of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s foreign policyis ensured by &apos;(a) consultation on major policy questions between M.O.I. and Foreign office in London;(b) day to day consultation by the Press Attache with the Ambassador or minister on the spot.The method of operation in the Dominions is similar, except that the field staff are paid by the Dominions Office. In the Colonies the field staff are (with certain exceptions) officers of the local Governments. Policy guidance in London derives from the department concerned.9. The case for handing over the whole publicity responsibility to the separate overseas departments is not a strong one; and the break up of theMinistry of Information^ overseas work will carry with it serious dis-advantages: (i) Many problems in the conduct of overseas publicity benefit from acommon approach and are handled by common machinery at head-quarters and in the posts, whether they affect foreign or colonial territories, India or the Dominions. This common approach and thefund of experience which goes with it will be dissipated. It is very doubtful whether the Departments taking over will be able to replacethis concerted publicity drive,(ii) Certain services, e.g., the work of the Ministry&apos;s Reference division and the London Press Service supplying daily guidance and publicitymaterial by multi-directional wireless, are common to the whole range of overseas service. If located in the Foreign Office they would not easily be available for other departments.(iii) Successful publicity work requires especially close collaboration betweenthe technicians who produce the films, printed and visual material and the regional specialists who study the conditions in the countries for which they are responsible. The experience of the Ministry ofInformation shows conclusively that this can best be secured by a team of men used to working together over a long period and responsible to a single accessible authority. An arrangement by which three orfour different departments draw for their materials on a separateInformation Agency, under different control and in a different part ofLondon, would create continuous delay and confusion and must proveultimately quite ineffective.(iv) It is difficult to see how a Government Information Agency could work without staff of its own overseas. The film staff of the Ministry, forexample, have been interchanged between headquarters and overseas posts; and generally the most close and intimate relations have been built up between staff overseas and at home. The loss of these contactswould take all the life out of the production side,(v) Publicity in the major countries is not a matter in which the ForeignOffice alone is concerned. It most closely concerns the Services, theTreasury, the Board of Trade, the Department of Overseas Trade,the Ministry of Food and other Departments. Co-ordination of thesedifferent interests is assisted by having a separate publicity depart-ment accessible to all. This factor is of particular importance in thework of the British Information Services in the United States.10. In many ways the work of the Ministry at home and overseas iscomplementary.(i) Overseas Departments are concerned also with publicity at home, e.g.,publicity about India, the Colonies and the Empire generally, forwhich the Ministry has been responsible.
(ii) Production for overseas and for the home market assist and supplement-one another.(iii) An important element in overseas publicity, the reception and handling of foreign vistors to this country depends on adequate facilities being available at Ministry headquarters and in the regions.(iv) It has been convenient during the war years to have a single department and its Minister generally responsible for the B.B.C. home and overseas services and accounting for the Broadcasting Vote.Assuming that the overseas services of the B.B.C. to the Empire andto foreign countries will be continued on a substantial scale for sometime to come, the Ministry of Information may suitably carry on this responsibility in order to secure the necessary co-ordination.11. If it is decided that the best solution on the overseas side is to retain the integrated and experienced organisation which has been built up in theMinistry of Information, then certain difficulties call for early solution, inparticular :  (i) Retention of experienced staff. Many of the senior staff in key positionslhave already left the Ministry or are likely to leave in the near future,jit will be impossible to offer a career service unless the department is sufficiently broadly based to offer opportunities of promotion.Salaries in many of the fields covered by the Ministry, e.g., journalism,films and advertising, are substantially in excess of Civil Service scales.Provision may therefore have to be made to secure competent technical staff on short-term contracts carrying salaries sufficient to attract thebest people. Established staff should be interchangeable with otherDepartments in the Civil Service and if required to serve abroadshould enjoy the same conditions as the Foreign Service.(ii) Publicity staff in the Dominions, India and the Colonies. In practice the publicity staffs under the High Commissioners in the Dominionshave been recruited, organised and serviced with material by theMinistry of Information, but are paid by the Dominions Office. Itis suggested that this arrangement should be revised and that, infuture, publicity staff abroad (other than the Local information officers of Colonial Governments) should be part of the main publicityOrganisation.(iii) The British Council. A redefinition of functions between the Ministryof Information and the British Council in the field is essential toavoid extensive duplication and waste of public funds. This mightbe on the lines of limiting the British Council to educational activitiesconcerned with the teaching of English and to educational contacts,leaving to the Ministry of Information all functions of publicity tothe general public in overseas countries.12. It may now be convenient to describe briefly the continuing functions ofthe Ministry of Information at home. The Ministry has already discarded theset-up of Local Information Committees and the system of reporting on public feeling throughout the country through the medium of the Home IntelligenceReports. The Press Censorship and the Postal and Telegraph Censorship (thelatter organised as a separate Department under the Minister of Information)will shortly come to an end, together with work for the Services in regard towar news and war needs.The chief continuing activities are those in which the Ministry acts for theHome Departments, notably the Ministries of Labour, Fuel and Power, Education,Health, Transport, and prospectively Town and Country Planning and national insurance.   They comprise the following branches : Press. War conditions and the strain on transport and communications have created obstacles to the freedom of news which will not quickly disappear, andjournalists will continue for some time to require assistance in overcoming them.Foreign journalists in London are equally dependent on various forms of help which frequently render good dividends in the shape of publicity favourable to britain in their respective countries. These various services are not necessarilypermanent requirements and their extent will diminish as time goes on. Therewill, however, still remain a strong need for the continuance of a central machinefor distributing Government statements to the press and publicity agencies andfor assisting other Departments in arranging Press Conferences.

It may now be convenient to describe briefly the continuing functions ofthe Ministry of Information at home. The Ministry has already discarded theset-up of Local Information Committees and the system of reporting on public feeling throughout the country through the medium of the Home IntelligenceReports. The Press Censorship and the Postal and Telegraph Censorship (thelatter organised as a separate Department under the Minister of Information)will shortly come to an end, together with work for the Services in regard towar news and war needs.The chief continuing activities are those in which the Ministry acts for theHome Departments, notably the Ministries of Labour, Fuel and Power, Education,Health, Transport, and prospectively Town and Country Planning and national insurance.   They comprise the following branches : Press. War conditions and the strain on transport and communications have created obstacles to the freedom of news which will not quickly disappear, andjournalists will continue for some time to require assistance in overcoming them.Foreign journalists in London are equally dependent on various forms of help which frequently render good dividends in the shape of publicity favourable to britain in their respective countries. These various services are not necessarilypermanent requirements and their extent will diminish as time goes on. Therewill, however, still remain a strong need for the continuance of a central machinefor distributing Government statements to the press and publicity agencies andfor assisting other Departments in arranging Press Conferences.
&apos; Home Division and Regional Organisa:tion.-This is the channel of distribu-tion for all forms of Government publicity to the people at home. The regional organisation provides the necessary machinery for the showing of Governmentdocumentary films to rural, factory and specialised audiences with the aid of anumber of mobile film units stationed round the country. It maintains contact with the provincial press and is an essential part of the machinery for providingtours and facilities for overseas visitors. It also assists in publicity campaignsfor other Departments and in handling Government exhibitions. Its maincreative form of publicity is the circulation of public speakers round the country,which will now be turned from war to reconstruction topics.Films.-The Ministry&apos;s Films Division is concerned both with productionand distribution. The post-war demand of Government Departments for instruc-tional and educational films shows that there will be no diminution in the wartimelevel of film activities. A central agency is clearly necessary to prevent thehaphazard incursion of all home departments into the film field. The bulk ofGovernment films will be made as hitherto by the documentary film industry undercontracts placed by the central agency. But the Crown Film Unit, which began in the Empire Marketing Board and was for some five years before the war theG.P.O. Film Unit, has set standards in documentary film making which have raised the quality of all British documentary films. The continuance of a CrownFilm Unit discharging a part of the Governments film requirements is as necessary an adjunct to the film industry as Woolwich Arsenal is to the manu-facture of military equipment. Arrangements for the showing of Governmentfilms are no less important than their production. These also should continueto be handled by the central film agency, working through the commercial cinemasor through the non-theatrical distribution scheme in the regions. The sameagency should also undertake the production and distribution of Governmentdocumentary films which are one of the principal media of overseas publicity.Photographs. The distribution of official photographs to the press will cease with the supply of material from the war fronts, and the general aim willbe to restore the press picture market to the newspapers and agencies and tointerfere as little as possible in competitive news picture production anddistribution. The extensive photographic library of the Ministry of information will, however, need to be maintained for some time to come and a central agencyis needed for the production of photographic material for Government publicityat home and overseas.Publications. The work of this Division of the Ministry will be severelycurtailed with the end of the war, and in the main the provision of official bookscould revert to the Stationery Office. The main activity of this Division of theMinistry will lie in the provision of pamphlets, digests and illustrated magazinesfor overseas.Exhibitions. The organisation of Government exhibitions was undertaken by the Department of Overseas Trade before the war and part of the Ministrystaff was drawn from that Department. The need for Government exhibitionsmay not be so great in peace-time, but a central organisation dealing with thishighly specialised activity both for the Ministry and for other Departments willremain.Advertising Compaigns. The Ministry has acted as a central co-ordinatingagency, and to a considerable extent as an executive agency for the conduct of publicity campaigns initiated by the Government. There is as yet no sign ofany reduction in this activity.Wartime Social Survey. -This body has carried out sociological enquiriesof various kinds, mainly on behalf of other departments, such as the Ministryof Health and the Board of Trade. Its work seems to have been highly valuedby these departments. Some enquiries have also been related to the Ministry&apos;sadvertising campaigns (e.g., Road Safety). The post-war use of this kind of research and its connection with the Ministry needs separate consideration.- 13. While many of these activities on the home front could no doubt be operated as a common service for other Departments in the event of the Ministryof Information being discontinued, it is doubtful if they could be successfullycombined in a separate Government Information Agency. There would be strong pressure for parts of this work to be taken over by other Departments, e.g., by the stationery Office, and the agency would not appear likely to be sufficientlybroadly based or to have an adequate status to attract expert staff or to enable
it to contribute effectively to the publicity effort of the larger departments. the Ministry of Information is to go, it would be better to scrap the idea of a central agency and disperse the work to the Stationery Office or elsewhere. Theresult which must be faced is a substantial lowering in the standards of British14. Another result would be to increase the size and cost of the public relations branches of the various home departments and to destroy the presentmeans of co-ordination between them. Each of the existing Public Relationsbranches would tend to set up a production side of its own and probably the overseas departments would do the same. The relationship between the depart-mental Public Relations Officers and the Ministry of Information is a matter which has been given a good deal of consideration during the war years and ithas even been suggested that these Public Relations Officers should be on the staffof the Ministry of Inforrm.i:ion. This would probably be a mistake, since it would reduce the effectiveness of these officers in their own departments and would beregarded as an infringement of departmental responsibility. On the other hand,the existence of the Ministry as a central publicity organisation has helped toenable the Public Relations Officers of the home departments to function as ateam for the co-ordination of Government campaigns. It may also be useful inthe future, as in certain instances in the past, that departmental Public RelationsOfficers should be recruited when possible from the Ministry of Information staff.In general, the existence of the Ministry has enabled the smaller departments to dispense with Public Relations Officers of their own and has prevented an evenlarger growth of the Public Relations branches in the larger departments.15. All these considerations lead to the conclusion that the Governmentshould retain the central organisation built up by the Ministry of Informationas a department of Ministerial status, functioning at home and overseas as a partof the machinery of Government, for only in this way can the Government hope to attract staff of the necessary quality to enable them to function efficiently, andthus to maintain British publicity on a basis adequate to the important tasks which lie ahead of it.Ministry of Information, W.C- 1,1. It is not possible at this stage to make any reliable forecast of the size and expenditure of a post-war Ministry of Information. This depends on anumber of policy decisions, on the dividing line between the Ministry and theBritish Council, and on the size and scope of the publicity work to be undertaken in the liberated territories in Europe and in the Far East in succession to militaryand other organisations which have operated hitherto.2. At the peak the staff of the Ministry numbered about 3,000 at home and3,000 overseas, and the peak annual estimate (1944-45) was  9,715,000.3. The following table sets out the Ministry&apos;s estimate for 1945-46together with a rough estimate of the Ministry&apos;s annual expenditure in thefuture so far as it can be seen at present after taking into consideration reductionsalready in train and without providing for any substantial change in activities : publicity at home and overseas.September, 1945.APPENDIX.Staff and Expenditure of Ministry of Information.Estimate1945-46.future expenditure.Subhead A (Staff)............Subhead B (Travelling   and    Incidental2,419,000 1,750,000Subhead C (Telegrams and Telephones)Subhead D (Publicity)     .........Expenses)576,000764,0004,562,000400,000400,0003,315,000Less ReceiptsTotal expenditure,321,000600,0005,865,000500,0007,721,0005,365,000

The home staff of the Ministry on the present basis is being reduced toabout 2,000, and overseas staff will shortly be reduced to about the same figure.5. It is appreciated that financial conditions will make it necessary toexercise rigid economy particularly in expenditure abroad in dollars and otherdifficult currencies. Yet in some directions, e.g., in liberated Europe, the far east, the Dominions and India, publicity work is only in embryo and should befurther developed.6. It will be seen from the table above that on the present basis Ministryexpenditure is expected to be roughly  5 million to  6 million a year. Of this total about one-third is spent at home in respect of home activities; about one-quarter is spent at home for the purpose of activities abroad; and slightly lessthan half is spent abroad. The Ministry&apos;s publicity expenditure at home is largely undertaken on behalf of other Departments. For example, expenditureon press and posters totalling nearly  1 million is mainly in respect of advertisingcampaigns for other Departments.
ANNEX V.REPORT OF OVERSEAS PUBLICITY SUB-COMMITTEE OF the external AFFAIRS GROUP OF THE parliamentary labour PARTY.1. The Sub-Committee, after meeting the Minister of Information and the under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and after very careful considera-tion, has come to the following conclusions : 2. In order to ensure that Government policy is made as effective as possiblein overseas publicity, two equally essential principles need to be reconciled : (a) Directives on policy must emanate from, and responsibility lie with, that ministry whose province is concerned; and(b) It is no less vital that the executants of publicity by film, radio,literature, &amp;o, should retain a full and genuine independence incarrying out their essentially technical work; otherwise the talentsneeded for each medium will be neither attracted nor exploited tothe full.3. From these premises it follows that the execution of government publicity, both home and overseas, should be under the unified control of a singleMinistry responsible not for making policy but for carrying it out.4.   This recommendation is reinforced by the following considerations : (a) The scope and technical complexity of modern publicity is such that itcannot properly be undertaken by sub-departments of Ministriesdesigned for other work.(b) Too many Ministries are involved in national publicity for it to become the preserve of any one of them.(c) Yet it is too delicate and too integrated an instrument to be divided upamongst a number of Ministries; and, if it is so divided, duplicationand overlapping must result, as is proved by the experience of theMinistry of Information and British Council.(d) It is impossible to divorce home and overseas Government publicitywithout great loss of effectiveness and economy (e.g., 2 separate filmunits). Equally, it is impossible to separate &quot; foreign &quot; from Empirepublicity without causing duplication.5. Therefore we are in favour of maintaining the present Ministry ofInformation, which should continue to receive its policy from all the Ministriesconcerned (e.g., Foreign Office, Dominions Office, India Office, Colonial Office,Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Board of Education, &amp;o).We think that in the case of quick publicity (e.g., news cables and wireless)there should also be direct access from the publicity executives to the Ministryconcerned for guidance and advice (e.g., B.B.C. should go direct to Foreign office for guidance on foreign news).6. It is urged that the present Ministry of Information should be enlargedto include the main organs of Government publicity.7. The British Council should be brought under the Minister (not theMinistry) of Information. The Minister should first iron out the present veryserious overlaps between the British Council and the M.O.I. Those functions ofthe British Council that are mainly forms of propaganda should be absorbed intothe M.O.I. The remaining functions (mainly academic and cultural) shouldcontinue to be carried out by the British Council under the supervision of theMinister of Information. If the British Council continues under the ForeignOffice undesirable rivalry and wasteful overlapping is unavoidable.8. The B.B.C. Foreign Services should be brought under the M.O.I. to theextent that a Controller should be jointly appointed by the B.B.C. and theMinister. Direct access for advice and guidance should exist to particularMinistries, in particular the Foreign Office.9. The M.O.I. should control overseas agencies in countries abroad, andshould have direct access to them. All types of publicity work in each countryabroad should be centralised in these agencies (except for those parts of the
British Council&apos;s work that are continued in the Minister&apos;s direct charge). Thenature of these overseas publicity agencies will vary in different countries. Inforeign countries there should be close liaison with the Embassy and the consular services; in the Dominions with the Dominions Office; and in the colonies withthe Colonial Office. In the colonies the publicity agency would, of course, come under the ultimate control of the Governor.10. Wherever possible liaison should be achieved by interchange of personnelrather than by liaison officers.11. As regards responsibility to Parliament, the Minister of information should answer questions relating to the execution of policy. All questions relative-igto the policy-content of publicity should be answered by the Minister concernedwith that aspect of policy.
