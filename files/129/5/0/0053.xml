THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT     202Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1945.SECRET.Copy No.0 c.p.. (45) 353.28th December, 1945.CABINET.MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AT their meeting on the 11th October (CM. (45) 40th Conclusions) theCabinet approved the proposal made in my memorandum CP. (45) 198, that discussions should take place, in co-operation with the Australian authorities,with the shipping interests, regarding future passage rates for assistedmigrants, on the understanding that a further report would be made to theCabinet in due course on the Australian proposals to limit the migrants&apos; con-tribution to  10 per adult. These discussions have now taken place withrepresentatives of the Australian and New Zealand Passenger Conference, andthe meeting was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Labour arid theMinistry of War Transport, as well as of my Department, together with two representatives of the Commonwealth Government.A full discussion took place, and the Conference representatives expressed their desire to co-operate as fully as possible. They explained, however, howdifficult it was for them to express any considered opinion in view of the factthat they were not at present operating on their own account a single passengership. For this, and other reasons, they did not feel themselves in a positionto give a reliable figure of the rates which they would feel bound to propose, togive them an economic return on their operations. It was felt that, in the circum-stances, it would be undesirable to press them on this account because of thelarge margin for contingencies which they would find it necessary to add toany figures during a period wdien close estimating was necessarily speculative.There is moreover no prospect that the position of uncertainty m which theshipping interests now find themselves will alter materially in the next twelvemonths, and any conclusions on which they might base their calculations would still be governed to some extent by the present high costs of replacing the shipsthey have lost during the war (which they estimate at not less than 100 per cent,above pre-war levels) and of refitting the surviving ships when these are released from troop-carrying.My colleagues will recollect that the Australian proposal was that the migrantshould be asked to pay a rate of  10 and that the balance should be shared equally between the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. The United King-dom Government proposed that the migrants&apos; contribution should be  15 peradult. The Australian Government, however, have continued to press me toagree to the figure proposed by them, and represent very strongly the importanceof an early decision so that would-be migrants may know now what will be their financial liability when shipping facilities are available. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will now authorise me to agree to it. It is clear that the australian government are set upon this rate, and I do not see any hope of concluding anagreement with them on the basis of any other figure.As I explained in my memorandum CP. (45) 198, the additional sum of  5per adult migrant would be shared with the Commonwealth Government andthe total sum involved could not be large.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,28th December, 1945.[31089]
