[IS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRET n[&quot; 69COPY NO.      0C.P.CU5) &quot;52050TH NOVEMBER.  19h7.CABINET^RELEASES FROM THE forces memorandum by the Minister of health the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggests in his report that those men in tho &quot;building industry and the building materials and components industries whose call-up was postponed,for n period of six weeks &quot;by decision of the Manpower Committeeshould now he called up.      Concurrently, the Class B releasesare to be increased.Building: industry the position in this industry is that apprenticed craftsmenhave always been reserved;    else a  group known to the Ministryof Labour as &quot;so-called apprentices&quot;.      The only men who havebeen called up are the unskilled labourers who will never becomecraftsmen.      This is the group under the stand-still arrangement which expires on hth December.I understand that at present the number of building tradeoperatives who reach 18 in any one year is 18*000.      Of those,10,000 are the apprenticed craftsmen;    h-,000 are the &quot;so-calledapprentices&quot;;    i+,000 are the unskilled labourers who were always,prior to the six weeks&apos;  stand-still, called up as they ret-.ched 18.There is at present ji  however, a serious shortage ofunskilled labourers in the building industry!     Already thereare 6,000 vacancies notified to the Ministry of Labour onpermanent housing work as against 11,500 men employed.      Thisvacancy figure is going to get steadily bigger.      I hoveinstructed all local authorities that they must make an earlystart with an instalment of their housing programmes, and I hopethat the very great majority will secure an approved tender for at least one scheme in their area within the next two to threemonths.      If I am successful in securing this,  the shortage ofbuilding labour will cause acute difficulties.In these circumstances,  it seems to me ill-advised to liftthe standstill on the call-up of men from the building industry -at any rate during the next three months - while men releasedunder Class B ere still only trickling back.     Not all the mendue for call-up ore,  of course, employed on housing, but a largeproportion must be so an ployed, either on permanent or temporaryhousing;    end I find it very difficult to square their releaseto the Forces with the government&apos;s decision that first priority should be given to housing.

I welcome the proposal for an increased release underClass B.      In the Building industry we shall need,  in selectingthe additional 1x0,000 to Be released,  to pay particular attention to securing a proper Balance.      Our experience of class B releases does show,  however, that it takes at least three months,  and often longer, to get the man Backj  and anincrease of the Class B figure- dees not immediately,  though itmay ultimately,  sot off the losses caused By call-up.I want to make it quite clear that in no circumstances could I agree to the call-up of any of the apprenticed craftsmenincluding the &quot;so-called apprentices&quot;.      As i&quot;understand thePaper,  however,  there is no suggestion of that.Building&apos; Materials industries I cannot agree to the release of the 3*000 men due forcoll-up in the Building materials industries, who ore alsounder a six weeks&apos;  stand-still.      It is really essential thattheir call-up should Be postponed,   cither indefinitely, or atthe least for review in six months&apos;  time;      I am advised thatwhen next yoar&apos;s Building season Begins,  the housing programmemay well Be seriously held up for want of certain materials,and this is likely to happen even though, these industries oreallowed to retain their whole existing strength,  and no matter what the releases under Class 3.      Unless the Minietor of Workscan give me an undertaking that serious Bottlenecks will notoccur In the production of materials up to the programme whichI have given to him,&apos; I cannot agree to a single man Being taken out of these industries.      I do not think that he can give methat undertaking.Housing C.omponent industries I also Believe it to he absolutely wrong that any men should Be called uo from these industries where also, I understand,we must expect serious Bottlenecks.      Here,  however, there isthe particular difficulty, which I appreciate, of distinguishingthe men engaged in a factory on production of housing componentsfrom those&quot; engaged in the same factory on other production.^ .The Minister of^LeBour was to  examine further the possibilityof no s toon inn; the call-uo of these men, But I have not yet soonhis&quot;report.   &quot; If these men can Be identified,  it seems to meequally necessary that their call-up should Be postponed, unlessthe Ministers responsible for production can give me anunderteklnb- that serious Bottlenecks will not occur.      Herear/ain I do &quot;not think that they can give me that undertaking.A. 3.Minister of Health,  S.W. 1.30th Novera&apos;!;-er,  1 9U5-
