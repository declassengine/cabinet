THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET.i      CP. (45) 315.1st December, 1945.CABINET.REPORT BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE ON THENATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.1. The Government are pledged in The King&apos;s Speech to pass in the current session a measure extending and improving the existing scheme of social insurance; and, in connection with the Motion put down by Government sup-porters on the subject of increases in the rates of old age pensions, a promisehas been given that improved rates of pension will be brought into effect beforenext winter. It is clearly desirable that these improved rates should be authorised by the main National Insurance Bill and not by separate emergency legislation;and the National Insurance Bill ought, therefore, if possible, to be publishedduring the Christmas Recess in order to ensure its passage by the early summer.To enable this to be done decisions on the main principles to be embodied in tireBill are urgently required.2. The Social Services Committee have considered proposals put forward by the Minister of National Insurance, some of which involve considerabledepartures from the Coalition Government White Paper (Cmd. 6550), and their recommendations to the Cabinet on these proposals are set out in the following paragraphs.3. Basis of Rates of Benefit and Pension, The White Paper argued againstthe adoption of a subsistence basis for benefit rates in a universal insurancescheme. We agree that it would be impracticable to vary benefit rates accordingto the needs of different individuals or to change them at short intervals accordingto variations in the general cost of living.   But it is, in our view, essential : (i) that the leading rates should be fixed initially at figures which can bejustified broadly in relation to the present level of the cost of living;and(ii) that definite arrangements should be made for a review of the ratesfrom this point of view at fixed intervals.To meet the first requirement we recommend that the rates should be cal-eulated on the basis of an addition of 31 per cent, to the basic subsistence figures given in the Beveridge Report, which were not seriously challenged in any quarterat the time of publication. This is in line with the Governments declared resolveto hold the cost of living at about 31 per cent, over the September 1939 level.To meet the second requirement the Minister of National Insurance should be under a statutory duty to review at five yearly intervals the rates of benefit,pensions and contributions by reference to all the relevant factors, including such expenditure as appears essential for the preservation of health and working-capacity, and to present his conclusions and proposals to Parliament.4. Rates of Sickness and Unemployment Benefit: On the basis recom-mencled in paragraph 3, the rates for a single man at work and for a couple wouldbe 25s. and 42s. respectively. But in order to leave undisturbed the 16s. rate foran adult dependant, which is already included in the National Insurance (Indus-trial Injuries) Bill, it is proposed that the 42s. should be divided in the proportionof 26s. for the man and 16s. for his wife, and that the rate for a single person should be 26s. These rates compare with 40s. for a couple and 24s. for a single person in the White Paper.[30981] copy No.   3 g
No change is proposed in the White Paper proposals that the rates ofunemployment and sickness benefit for a married woman insured in her own right should be 20s. and 16s. respectively and that the standard rates of bothunemployment and sickness benefit should be reduced where in the relevantcontribution year the claimant has gaps in his record of contributions which arenot covered by excusals for proved unemployment or sickness. ,5. -Duration of Sickness and Unemployment Benefit-The White Paper,departing from the Beveridge Report, proposed that sickness and unemploymentbenefit should be limited in duration three years for sickness benefit, after whichthe claimant was to be entitled to invalidity benefit, and thirty weeks forunemployment benefit (except for claimants with exceptionally good contributionrecords). There seems to be no justification from the point of view of humanneeds for a reduction in the benefit for a sick person after the lapse of anyparticular period of time and the cost of removing the limitation on sickness benefit is relatively small. We have, therefore, no hesitation in recommending that there should be no provision for invalidity benefit and no limit on thepayment of sickness benefit, subject always to the qualifying condition of 156 paidcontributions.. We have had more difficulty over the question whether there should be anyautomatic limit on the period of unemployment benefit. The cost of abolishingaltogether the White Paper limits would be substantial (viz., an addition of about7d. to the weekly rate of contribution). We feel that it is hard to justify anyautomatic limitation on the period of unemployment benefit, since in many, if notmost, cases the prolongation of unemployment is due to no fault on the part ofthe applicant. On the other hand, there is clearly some risk of abuse on the partof,a minority of unsatisfactory persons if no limitation is imposed, and we have,therefore, given much study to the question whether it would be possible to devisesuitable safeguards against such abuse. It is already provided that benefit maybe withdrawn from a person who refuses an offer of suitable employment or training or who loses his employment through misconduct, and this provision would be continued under the new scheme. But it cannot be claimed that thesesafeguards are by themselves adequate, since even in times of good employmentit may be very difficult, having regard to the established policy of the Ministerof Labour in the offering of employment, to offer a suitable job to the type ofapplicant at whom an automatic limit is aimed. The offer of training orreconditioning in the sense in which the provision of these facilities is contem-plated by the Ministry of Labour would be subject to the same limitations. Onthe other hand, alternative safeguards which we have considered would, in ourview, be open to the same criticisms as were levelled against the &quot; not genuinelyseeking work &apos;&apos; condition.  We have, therefore, been driven to the conclusion that! reliance must be placed on the ability of the Government to provide, as part ofits full employment policy, offers of work or of suitable training to all thosewho become unemployed, long before they have become virtually pensioners oni  the unemployment fund.6. Payment for First or Only Child in the Case of Sickness, Unemploymentor Widowhood. The Beveridge Report suggested that the payment for a childshould be 8s. after making some allowance for payments in kind. The coalition government substituted a rate of 5s., justified by the provision of more generousallowances in kind, and this has since been adopted in the Family AllowancesAct. The rate for a first or only child embodied in the Industrial Injuries Billis 7s. 6d., and in all the circumstances we recommend a rate of 7s. Qd. for thefirst or only child.7. Rates of Retirement Pension. The Beveridge Report recommendedthat the ultimate rate of retirement pension for a couple not, however, to be payable until twenty years after the inception of the scheme should be 40s.,i.e., the same as the proposed rate of sickness and unemployment benefit. TheWhite Paper proposed a rate of 35s. payable from the inception of the scheme.Although on the subsistence basis indicated in paragraph 3 above a rate of 40s.would still be adequate for a retired couple, we believe that the right course is to make the rate of retirement pension for a couple identical with that of sickness and unemployment benefit for a couple (see paragraph 4 above), and we accordingly propose that the rate should be 42s.A difficult question arises with regard to the division of the rate of 42s.between husband and wife. If the total sum is divided equally, the work of bringing the new rates into operation in the autumn of 1946 will be much eased
and certain difficulties in adjusting the scale of means for calculation of nqn-contributory.old age pensions will be avoided. On the other hand, the Ministerof National Insurance feels that it would be impossible to defend a rate of 21s.for a single person living alone on a subsistence basis and, that the Governmentwould be in a much stronger position to resist pressure from the Old age pensioners&apos; Association, who are advocating a rate of 30s. a week for a single person at age 60, if the rate of retirement pension for a single person were linked with the rate for sickness or unemployment benefit. On the whole,therefore, we recommend that the joint rate should be divided in the proportionof 26s. to 16s. and that the single pensioner should receive 26s. We must,however, point out that the adoption of this recommendation will involve an addition of 7d. to the weekly rate of contribution and a substantial increase inthe ultimate burden falling on the Exchequer, as compared with the 21s. basis.8. Payment of Unconditional Pensions on the A ttainment of pensionable age. The Beveridge Report proposed that no pension should be payable untilretirement, and that to induce persons over pensionable age to remain at workan addition of Is. a week (2s. for a couple) should be given for each year bywhich retirement was postponed. This recommendation was endorsed by theWhite Paper.We regard it as essential, in view of the shortage of man-power with whichwe shall be faced for many years, that all possible incentives should be given to workers to postpone retirement. The offer of an additional Is. a week (25. fora couple) for each year by which retirement is postponed is, in our view, atotally inadequate inducement; and it would probably be necessary to givesomething of the orde^ of 5s. for each year of postponement to have any appreciable effect. To follow the White Paper in making the whole pension at the rates now proposed conditional on retirement would be likely, in ourview, to precipitate immediate retirement in a large number of cases on reachingpensionable age, notwithstanding such inducements for postponement as itmight be practicable to offer. Moreover, present insured persons have beenpaying contributions in the expectation of unconditional pensions at 65(60 women) and there is no doubt that, particularly among voluntary contribu-tors, there would be a strong sense of grievance if this right were nowwithdrawn. We, therefore, recommend, as the best solution, the payment of an unconditional pension of 10s. a week on the attainment of pensionable age,with additions on retirement to make up the total rate to 26s. single or 42s. fora couple. This would have the added advantage of avoiding an anomaly,which would otherwise arise, between persons reaching pensionable age beforethe scheme came into operation, who would receive a pension of 10s.unconditionally, and those who attained pensionable age after the beginningof the scheme, who would get nothing until they retired. On the question of earnings by a pensioner after retirement (e.g., by casual work in his old trade),we feel that a man earning 20s. a week cannot be said to have retired fromactive work and accordingly we recommend that earnings in excess of 20s. aweek should be taken into account to reduce the increase in pension over 10s.a week awarded on retirement.9. Widows&apos; Pensions. In accordance with the proposals made in para-graphs 4 and 6 above, a widow with a child will receive guardian&apos;s benefit at therate of 33s. Qd. (i.e., 26s. in her own right and. 7s. Qd. for her child) instead of29s., as proposed in the White Paper, Further, if 26s. is accepted as the rate of retirement pension for a single person, a woman without children who becomes a widow at the age of 50 or over will receive a pension at the rate of 26s. a week.The White Paper proposed that a childless widow who lost her husbandbefore reaching the age of 50 should not be entitled to widow&apos;s pension, subject tothe transitional provision that all women married to insured men at the commence-ment of the new scheme should be eligible for a widow&apos;s pension of 10s. a week.We have considered whether any concession should be made here, but have cometo the conclusion that no change would be justified. We feel, however, that aspecial concession is necessary in the case of a widow who has been in receipt ofguardian&apos;s benefit and who, under the White Paper proposals, would lose herbenefit if she ceased to have in her care a child of school age while herself still under the age of 50 and would not qualify for a pension until the age of 60.There is much to be said for enabling such a widow to maintain a home for her[30981] b 2
adolescent children without being obliged herself to enter the labour market;and we accordingly recommend that a widow of 40 or over should become eligiblefor widow&apos;s pension at the rate of 26s. on ceasing to be eligible for guardian&apos;benefit because her youngest or only child has attained the age of 16 or has died,provided always that her marriage took place ten years or more before theapplication for pension.10. Non-Contributory Pensions. The White Paper proposed Jthat the non-contributory pension scheme for persons aged 70 or over should be restricted to persons who were aged 70 and over on the appointed day subject to an adjust-ment of the present means scale persons becoming 70 after the appointed daybeing given recourse to the Assistance Board. We feel that this proposal is opento criticism and that the right solution is to give a right to a non-contributorypension at age 70 to all persons of 55 or over at the date when the schemecomes into operation. Those who are under 55 at that date will have time to qualify for a contributory pension under the new scheme.The administration of the non-contributory pensions scheme and investiga-tion of individual applications is- at present carried out by the Board of customs and Excise, but pensions are formally awarded by local pension committeesnominated by local authorities. We have considered whether after the appointed day the administration should be transferred from the Board of Customs and excise to the Assistance Board, but have reached the conclusion that it would bebetter to postpone any transfer until the time comes to transfer the public assist-ance functions of local authorities generally to the Assistance Board.11. Blind Pensioners.-Tlh.e White Paper proposed that the system of pay-ing non-contributory pensions to the blind at the age of 40 should be discontinuedsubject to the exception that pensions at the increased rate should be payable to persons already in receipt of blind pensions on the appointed day. We feel thatthere would be great difficulty in bringing to an end in the forthcoming insurancemeasure the long-standing arrangement under which blind persons are entitledto pensions at the age of 40, but we recommend that the position of the blindshould be considered as a whole when the further legislation to deal w7ith theproposed extension of national assistance is being framed. We think, however,that the opportunity should be taken on the introduction of the new insurancescheme to remove the present anomaly which results in insured blind pensionersbeing entitled to both blind and old age pensions between the ages of 65 and 70.12. Rates of Contribution and of Income and Expenditure.-AppeTided tothis memorandum are tables prepared by the Government Actuary which illus-trate the effect of our proposals and of the reduction of rates of interest from per cent, to 2f- per cent, on the weekly rates of contribution by workers and employers and on the income and expenditure of the scheme.Table I shows the rates which, it is provisionally estimated, would be payablewhen the full scheme had come into operation, including the contribution payable under the Industrial Injuries Scheme.Table II show-s for Class I how each of the proposed departures from theWhite Paper affects the rate of contributions.Table III shows for 1948, 1958 and 1968 the levels of income and expenditure.13. It will be seen that, if allowance is made for the effect of a reduction inthe rate of interest from 3 per cent, to 2f per cent, the effect of adopting all our proposals is to require total weekly contributions provisionally esimated at thefollowing rates : ;Class IClass IIClass IVInsured Man55. 2d.5s. %d.4s. 8d.Employer4s. 5d.Insured Woman4s.4s. M.3s. 8d.Employer3s. 5d.We think that these contributions are too high. On the other hand, we believethat the insured man in Class I could reasonably be expected to pay as much as4s Qd., having regard to the economies in other directions which the new scheme will enable him to make, and that insured women in Class I and persons in other classes could pay correspondingly reduced contributions. Accordingly, on theassumption that the Cabinet accept our recommendations for the payment ot
unemployment benefit without limitation and of retirement pensions to singlepersons at the rate of 26.s., we think that the possibility should be examined ofsecuring the necessary reductions by (i) exempting the insured person from any contribution towards the health service scheme beyond the \\d. a week which persons insured under existing schemes already pay; and(ii) making up the balance of the reductions by an increased Exchequerpayment to the fund to compensate for the increase in contributionsresulting from the lowering of interest rates.A.
