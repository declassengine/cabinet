DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF EIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERN!1E G R E copy NO.. 5   ^fhg. [Ml  3361 Oth Decembeg,  1 9U5.cabinet proposed SELECT COMMITTEE ON POSSIBLE INFRINGEMENTSOF THE SUCCESSION TO TKB&quot;&quot;cRQWN ACT,  1707*Memorandum by the Lord President of the council I attach a copy of a report which,   at the request of thePrime Minister,  the Lord Chancel&quot;1.or end the Lav/ Officers have prepared on possible i.nfringements of Section 2kof the succession to the Crown Act,  170?.      As will be seen,  this deals with anumber of further cases in which Members of Parliament appearto.have exposed   themselves to the risk of disqualification byretaining offices or places of profit.In the opinion of the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers,there is a real danger that certain Members were disqualified,though on balance their inclination would be to the contrary view.In the circumstances,  however,  the:/ think that the proper course is to appoint a Select Committee to investigate the position andreport.The Prime Minister has approved this proposal and his askedrae, in conjunction with the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers,and the Chief Whip,  to  proceed with, the setting up of the proposedSelect Committee.The Lord Chancellor and his colleagues are preparing termsof reference to the Committee,  and I have suggested that these should be as wide as possible,  so as to cover any other cases which may conceivably have been overlooked, with the object of disposing of all such cases, and,  if this is practicable,preventing as for as possible the recurrence of trouble in thefuture.I think, however,  that before the terms of reference arefinally settled,  I should bring the matter to the notice of mycolleagues,  so that they may have the opportunity of making sure that there are no other Members serving in connection with their departments whose position may also be doubtful,  and should be covered by the Select Committee&apos;s inquiry.      I would suggest, too,that they should consider the issue of appropriate instructionsto prevent difficulties arising in the future and be prepared togive suitable advice to candidates in the event of General andby-elections.      Any such instructions would,  of course,  have tobe looked at again in the light of the Select Committee&apos;s report and the action taken on it.The Chief Whip has advised the Members concerned to abstain from attending Parliament for the   time being,  and it is important that the Committee should set to work urgently.      I accordinglypropose to announce our intentions to the House on Thursday, witha view to the Select Committee being set up before the Recess,  andthat they shall be given power to sit during the Recess,  and beasked to report before the House rosucies.Office oi   one Lord Presidentof the Council,Gt. George St.,  S.W. 1 .10th December,    19^5.

OFFICES OP PROFIT UNDER THE CROWReport by the Lord Chancellor end the Lev/ officers on possible infringements of Section 2k. ofthe Succession to the Crown Act,  1707.We will preface this report by a brief summery of thecircumstances relating -to each, case,  and will then state theconclusions we hove reached with regard to them.     We have, however,pieced the case of Mr.  D.T.  Jones,  the Member for Hartlepools,  ina separate category, because he wrote a letter resigning hiseppointment in sufficient time,  In our opinion, to avoid dis-qualification.      In all the other cases,  however,  the appointment was, we find,  still held by the Member in  question both on 5th July,19U.5, Polling Day,  and on 26th July,  the day of the declaration ofthe results.      The cases,  then, may be briefly summarised as follows&quot;I *    Mr. D.T.  Jones, Member for HartlepoolsMr. Jones was,  on the 29th October,  191+3,  appointed a part-time member of a Pensions Appeals Tribunal.      He sat on a fewoccasions and,  according to himself,  sent a letter on the 3rd June,191+5* to the Secretary, Pensions Appeals Tribunal, Royal courts of Justice,  in the following terms:-&quot;In consequence of a change in circumstances, will you pleasenote that I shall no longer be available to continue onthe panel of civilian persons to hear Pensions Appeals.&quot;The pensions Appeals Tribunal Office and the Lord Chancellor&apos;department state that they cannot trace receipt of this letter.Mr. Jones has produced,&apos; however, what purports to be a carbon copyof the letter which he sent,  and   has also been seen on the matter by the Solicitor-General.      He is quite definite that he actuallysent the letter,  and that  it was not received back through theDead Letter Office;    and the Solicitor-General feels thatMr. Jones&apos;  statement on this matter should be accepted.      The&quot;constitution&quot; of Pensions Appeals Tribunals as described in theSchedule to the Pensions Appeals Tribunals Act, 191+3,  does not provide in terms for appointments for any specific period.      Inthe correspondence,  however,  which took place prior to Mr.  Jones&apos;appointment,  it is described as temporary and subject to one month&apos;notice on either side.      If the letter of   &apos;3rd June, 19h7, was sentand received - which we think it was - Mr.  Jones&apos;  appointment,  inour view,  came to on end before any question of disqualificationcould arise.      As stated,   therefore,  his case, we think,  falls intoclass by itself,  and there is no reason for suggesting thatMr. Jones was under any disqualification by reason of Section 21+of the Succession to the Crown Act,  1707-2.    Mr.  J. Harrison, Member for Nottingham,  East.Mr. Harrison was likewise appointed a  part-time member ofPensions Appeals Tribunals.    He sat on various occasions.      On the17th October,  i945* be wrote to the Secretary to the PensionsAppeals Tribunal o letter in the following terms:-&quot;It had been my intention of resigning from the panel ofCD.  lay members of the Tribunals before,   so pleaseaccept my resignation  ...&quot;

This was acknowledged by a letter from the Secretary datedthe 23rd October,  19k5, reading:-&quot;I hove received your letter of 17th October   tenderingyour resignation as a lay member of a Pensions AppealsTribunal.      Please accept my thanks for your services.&quot;Mr.  Harrison&apos;s appointment, we understand, was by letter dated  29th October, 19,-3,  and was,  as in the case of Mr. Jones,for an indeterminate period.      As a matter of law,  therefore,wo think that both on   5th July and  26th July, 19k5,  that is,Polling day and the day of the declaration of the results,Mr.  Harrison was still the holder of the appointment.      Westate our conclusions as to the consequences in law arising fromthese circumstances later on in this report.3-    Mrs.  Corbet, Member for CorribcrwellMrs. Corbet was appointed a part-time assessor to sit withan Umpire to deal with hardship cases under the NationalService (Armed Forces) Act,  1939,  her appointment being madeunder Section 6,   sub-section 3 end Part II of the Schedule tothe Act,  and the remuneration payable to her being provided for under Section 6,   sub-section 10(a)  of the Act.      As such,  shebecame a member of a panel constituted by the Minister for thepurposes of the Act,  and was liable for selection by theMinister to sit as an assessor with an Umpire to deal withappeals from a Military Service (Hardship) Committee.      Theappointment was made by letter dated 31st May,  19h3,  and was,in the first Instance, for one year until the 31st May,  19kk.On the 13th May,  19kk,  however,  a further letter was writteninviting her to continue in her appointment &quot;for the period ending 31 St May,  19k5,  and, unless the Minister determinesotherwise, for such longer period as may elapse before a furtherappointment is made.&quot;      This further appointment she accepted,and we feel that&apos;this is an appointment for a period whichwould only expire when &quot;a further appointment is made&quot;.      Itwas not determined before the 5th or the 26th July,  19k5, withthe result that the question does arise whether there may nothave been a disqualification by reason of her appointment underthe provisions of Section 2k of the Succession to the CrownAct, 1707.k.    Mr. Awbery, Member for Bristol CentralMr.  Awbery was likewise appointed to the panel ofassessors to the Umpire under the National Service (armed forces)  Act,  19395   on the 11th February,  191x3.      His appointment was,  on the 12th February, 19kk,  extended &quot;for the period ending28th February, 19k5,  end unless the Minister determinesotherwise, for such longer period as may elapse before afurther appointment is ancle,&quot;This extension of his appointment was accepted byMr. Awbery.      On the 21st July^  191x5, Mr. Awbery wrote to theMinister of Labour in the following terms:-&quot;As a Parliamentary candidate I understand that it isnecessary that I should relinquish my position asmember of the National Service Hardship Committee.I therefore ask you to accept my resignation.&quot;

The Ministry of Labour replied to this letter on the21st August 1945 as follows&quot;I am directed by the Minister of National service to refer to your letter of the  21st July ,.... I amto say that in view of ycur subsequent election as aMember of Parliament the Minister feels that he must accept your resignation as assessor to the Umpireunder the National Service Acts * * o 0 o  &quot;In this case, therefore, again we feel that ( Mr. Awberywas at the material time still the holder of his&apos;appointment,,By his letter of the 21st July  1945? Mr. Awbery asked theMinister to accept his resignation,.      If, however, his appointment was &quot;unless the Minister determines otherwisefor such longer period as may elapse before a further,appointment is made&quot;, we feel that in law his letter/amountedto no more than an offer to terminate his appointment soonerthan it would, under its terms, come to an end;    since inaccordance with its terms it could only end when a furtherappointment was made or the Minister decided that it shouldbefore the making of such further appointment come to an end.Unfortunately, Mr. Awbery&apos;s offer was not accepted by theMinister until the letter of the 21st August was sent.    Wetherefore think that in law both on 5th July and  26th July1945* Mr. Awbery was still the holder of the appointment.5 * -     Mr. Jack Jones? Member for BoltonMr...Jones was appointed Chairman of a Local AppealsBoard set up under Section 5?  sub-section A of the Essential7/orks (General Provisions) No, 2 Order 1942c      His appointment was dated 1st October 1943, and was for the period ending31st March 1944 &quot;and unless the Minister determines otherwisefor such further period as may elapse before anotherappointment is made&quot;*     On the 3rd July,  1.944.* Mr.Jones was further appointed as Chairman of Reinstatement Committeesset up to deal with questions arising under the provisions ofthe Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act:,  1944*      Thisappointment was until the 31st March,  1945?   &quot;and for such further period as may be determined&quot;,.      There was no formaldetermination of this appointments      Apparently, however,&apos;in August, 1945? Mr. Johes wrote that owing to a misunderstandingon his part he was under the impression that he &quot;had intimated informally last year that he  intended that hisretirement from the Chairmanship should date from the last session over which he bad presided o    *.&apos; o    . &quot;    His last session was in August, 1944-      On the 5th September, 1945s  aletter was written from the Ministry to Mr.  Jones in thefollowing terms:-,!        &quot;It has just been brought to Mr. George Isaacs&apos;notice that owing to a misunderstanding; it was not realised that you wished to relinquish your appointments as chairman of a Local Appeals Board and ReinstatementCommittee ...    .    following your adoption as a parliamentary candidate last year.      The Minister nowaccepts your resignation with effect from the 31st August, ,1944?  in accordance with your wishes *    .  &quot; .&quot;

We feel that this purported retrospective acceptance ofMr. Jones&apos; resignation was not in law effective to determineMr.  Jones&apos; appointments as from tho 31st August, 1944*    Inour opinion, his appointments continued until $he letterof 5tU September, *9k5, was sent by the Ministry to Mr.  Jones,and he was therefore the holder of these appointments atthe material time which, as wo have previously indicated,is either 5th July or 26th July, 1945.Prom the above summary, it will appear that each member other than Mr. D.T.  Jones was still the holder of an appointment at Polling Day and on the day of tho declarationof the result.      In this  state of fact questions of la?/ ofthe utmost difficulty and uncertainty arise.      Section 24 ofthe Succession to the Crown Act, 1707? so far as material,read as follows:-&quot;No person who shall have  .    .    , any new office  or place of -profit whatsoever under the Crown which atany time since  the 25th October 1705 shall have been created or erected or hereafter shall be created orerected .    .    . shall be capable of being elected orsitting or voting-as a Member of the House of Commons inany parliament which shall be hereafter summoned and holder.&quot;.To begin with,  it is difficult to determine at whatdate it can be said that the Member is &quot;elected&quot; for thepurpose of the Section,  out this must be either,  so far asthe present case is concerned,  5th July or 2 6th July, 1945 andas the Members concerned held their appointments on bothdates,   it does not for present purposes matter which is theactual date by reference  to which the matter has  to bedecided.      What,&apos; however, rioes occasion the  greatest difficulty to our minds,   is the precise moaning in the firstplace of the words &quot;office or place&quot;,  and secondly the words&quot;of profit&quot; in the Section,      Some guidance as to themeaning of the words &quot;of profit&quot; is to be found in the caseof Delano v. Hillcoat, (9 Barnewall and Crosswell, 310),in which it is stated that the test is &quot;what&amp;sr there is areasonable expectation that profit would be made from theoffice.      In each case the Member in Question only becameentitled to receive remuneration if he was actually called to sit a:;; a member of the Court or Tribunal in question.    Theywere virtually no more than Members of panels from whichCourts or Tribunals might be made up to sit to determineparticular cases brought before that Court or Tribunal foradjudication.      It seems to us   chat it is going a long way tosay that  in these circumstances  the Members were holders ofan office or place at all within the meaning of Section 24of the Act.      Moreover, even if they were holders of an&quot;office or place&quot;, we foci doubtful whether it could bo saidthat tho office or place was.an office of place of profit-whenits holders wore not actually sitting and discharging. theirjudicial functions, and thereby bocoming entitled to recicveremuneration.      It must, however, be remembered that in theroobnt&apos;&quot;&apos;case of Mrs. Mann and Mr. Pornjan-,&apos; &quot;the Select Committee;r&amp;portccl that tho disqualification dperatcd, although in their case they were paid only when they&apos;sat&apos; as members of the Tribunal.

-    151In that case the Tribunal was set up under the Sent, ofFurnished Houses (Control)  (Scotland) Act,  1943.      TheTribunal set up to hoar Pensions Appeals under the PensionsAppeals Tribunals Act, 1943* approximates. in some respectsmore closely to the Tribunals set up under the Rent ofFurnished Lib uses (Control) (Scotland) Act, 1943, than to theother Tribunals in question in the present report.Our inclination would have been to the view that atany rate in the case of those otaer Tribunals,  the appointments were neither offices nor places, nor were theyoffices or places of profit except during the actual periodsduring which the holders of the appointments were sitting as members of the Tribunals.     Hetwithstanding this, however,we are impressed by the consideration that considerabledissatisfaction might be aroused if it should hereafter cometo light that notwithstanding the extreme uncertainty of thelaw, no ste-ps had been taken to ascertain its real effect in the present case by the appropriate parliamentary procedure.We feel that we must at least advise that there is a real danger that the Members in question,  and in particularthose who were Members of the Pensions Appeals Tribunals,were disqualified, although on balance our inclination would beto the contrary view.      This being so, we suggest that theproper course is that a Select Committee should bo appointedto consider these cases.      To leave the matter as  it stands in&apos; our view might be regarded as lacking in candour towardsthe House. .    Our advice  to the Prime Minister,  therefore, isthat steps should be taken to obtain the appointment of a SelectCommittee to investigate the position and report.(Signed)      JQWITTHARTEEX: SHAW CROSS,SMK SOSKIOE.
