RI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP.HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (us)3211ST DECEMBER,19k5CABINETRELEASES PROM THE forces memorandum by the minister of Works1.      I have read the memoranda of the Chairman of theMan-Power Committee, the Minister of. Health and theJoint Parliamentary Under-8ecretary of State for scotland on the proposals of the Man-Power Committee,  and I thinkit will Be useful if I state concisely what I conceive toBe necessary as regards the Building and Building materials and Components. Industries.2.      I am faced with the task of Building up By 130,000the laBour force for the Building Materials and ComponentsIndustries By June next.      The inflow of labour into these industries is disappointingly small, and the numbersaccruing from Class A and Class B releases are insignificant.I appreciate that as men are   &quot;eleased from the forces there is a likelihood of greaeer increases being realised in the labour force in these industries, but the difficultiesin reaching the target are bound to be overwhelming.      Inthese circumstances, if I am to be in a position to makethe materials available for the building programme,  I amunable to concur in any proposal which takes away able-bodiedmen from industries where recruitment is proving sointractable,  and, I suggest therefore that the suspension of the call-up of these young men (numbering about 3*000a year) should Be continued, if not indefinitely, at least until It becomes clear that the intake from other sourceswill be  sufficient to meet the needs of the building programme.3.      The position in the building and civil engineering industries, regarded as a whole, is not quite so acute, andI would agree that But for the special considerationsreferred, to Below the new proposals for the release of menunder Class B should. Be adequate.      Owing largely, however,to the fact that the housing programme is in its early stages the demands for labourers are far in excess of theavailable supply, and the laBour force as at present constituted is out of balance with the present stage of theprogramme.h.      In these circumstances I would urge upon my colleagues the desirability of continuing the suspension of the call-upof unskilled, men reaching the age of 18 years for a further period.G.T.Ministry of Works,1ST DECEMBER,19U5COPY NO      /&amp;
