If the initiative fora Ministerial broadcast comes from theGovernment side the Governmentdepartment prescribed will ascertain the views of the B.B.C. before conveyingapproval to the broadcaster.2. When a broadcast has been givenby a person of Ministerial rank whichthe B.B.C. regard as falling within the region of Party politics rather than astatement of national policy, the B.B.C.is free to arrange for a broadcast inreply to be given by a spokesman of theofficial Opposition.3. If in connection with any broad-cast of national importance dealingwith foreign affairs the Governmentinform the B.B.C. that they have theagreement of the Leader of the Opposi-tion that the statement in question is astatement of national policy, the B.B.C.will accept this decision and will not allow a broadcast in answer.[31032]Notes.Present procedure.If the necessary agreement was not forthcoming it would be for the Govern-ment to consider whether they wouldinvoke Clause 4 (3) of the Licence.
4. If the Government desires astatement to be broadcast which itregards as controversial between theGovernment and the official Oppositionit should so inform the B.B.C. who should then invite the official Opposi-tion to provide a broadcaster.5.

Shouldthe B.B.C. accept the proposal they will inform the Government without delay,and if asked will arrange for a Govern-ment reply.6.

On certain occasions the practiceof broadcasting a brief rejoinder by theGovernment, as in the case of the pre-war Budget broadcasts, should bearranged.8. &quot;When a Debate on a major matterof policy is imminent or actually takingplace in Parliament, the B.B.C. shouldnot (as a general rule) allow broadcastsof Ministerial or other ex parte state-ments thereon until the Bill has had itsthird reading in the House of Commonsor the business has been completed.9. Arrangements which may beprivately come to between the political parties in regard to broadcasting on political matters cannot override oraffect this agreement.On receiving such intimation three courses would be open to the Govern-ment :-(1) To ignore the broadcast.(2) To reply.(3) To get the broadcast cancelled byagreement with the Leader ofthe Opposition, or to invokeClause 4 (3) of the Licence.The Government will thus have timeto decide whether to ask for a right of reply under 7. It will be understoodsuch approaches to third parties would only be made if there were specialcircumstances, and not as a general rule.&quot; Imminent&apos;&apos; means approximately(not more than) a fortnight. It is not desirable there should be a Debate inthe House and on the wireless at thesame time.
