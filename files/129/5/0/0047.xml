raiBPggPMMIT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December&apos; 1945.SECRET.OP. (45) 347.27tk December, 1945.Copy No.CABINET.FOREIGN NAVIES-NEW CONSTRUCTION.Memorandum by the Eirst Lord of the Admiralty.AT the meeting of the Cabinet on the 27th November, I undertook to submitinformation about prospective Naval construction by other countries. There isvery little definite information except in the case of the United States, largely because of the disruption of building facilities in Europe. The attached table shows the. present position.i 2., The present strength of the United States, Soviet, and French Naviesis as follows : 	Battle-ships.	Aircraft Carriers.	Cruisers.	Light Cruisers (Flotilla Leaders).	Destroyers.	Submarines.United States   ... Soviet Union France	23 3 4	106           75 9 i 2             9 i		5 7	373 43 16	210 200 273.   The estimated strength of the United States Navy in 1650 is: 1Battleships.	Aircraft Carriers.	Cruisers	Light Cruisers (Flotilla Leaders).	Destroyers.	Submarines.18	116	82		367	199This allows for warships to be scrapped, for the return of lend-lease vessels,and for possible acquisitions from enemy navies. All warships at present under construction should be completed by the middle of 1947 and no appropriationshave yet been made of later construction.4. The future Soviet building programmes depend on the reconstruction of soviet shipyards in the North. Two years will be required to complete the yardat Molotovsk. In the Baltic, although the damage is relatively less than elsewhere,some reconstruction is essential before full-scale building can be resumed. In the black Sea, the main Soviet shipyards at Nikolaev will need to be rebuilt from the foundations. It follows that the strength of the Soviet Navy in five years time canonly be conjecture. It is, however, necessary to add the warning, based onexperience between 1936 and 1940, when 4 cruisers and nearly 30 destroyers were completed with the strict control of labour, unlimited funds, and the assistanceof equipment specialists from Germany that the tempo of Soviet building maybe rapid. That this is no idle warning is borne out by the information recentlyaccepted as true that the Russians have two cruisers in the Far East. Prior to1939, the ship-building facilities in the Far East were insufficient to build such[31072]
ships, and the conclusion therefore is that in spite of the drain in material and(men&quot; for the war in the West, the ship-building facilities in the Far East weredeveloped and the cruisers built. The Russians have recently made tentativeenquiries of British firms for the construction of large destroyers, a fast mine-layer, and other warships. Negotiations have not yet resulted in any orders,but the firms are still in negotiation with the Soviet Authorities. :      : ;5. French ship-building facilities are so badly damaged that they must have great difficulty in preparing any programme, and we have no firm information.All French resources in the immediate future are likely to be concentrated on the repair of damaged or scuttled units and the completion of ships which were inGerman hands during the war.6. Of the small navies, Sweden has completed 12 destroyers, 18 submarines and 16 M.T.Bs. during the war; she has launched 2 cruisers, 7,200 tons, in 1944and 1945, and 2 destroyers of 1,800 tons in 1945. It is obvious that she is pressing forward a programme designed to enhance the.efficiency of her Navy with thegreatest possible speed.7. The Naval yard at Horten in Norway was severely damaged by theR.A.F. during the war. This yard was capable of building destroyers, but thereis no evidence of any new construction programme, and the Norwegians are likelyto meet their needs for the next few years by buying ships from the Royal Navy.8. No new Dutch construction is being progressed at present. Two cruisershad been started by 1940, but the Dutch have not yet decided whether to continuework on them or to scrap them. As in the case of Norway, it seems likely that theDutch will rely on approachesjrom the Admiralty to meet their immediate needs.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W.1,27th December, 1945.
