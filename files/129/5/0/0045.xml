THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1945. . (_                   &quot;        1(SECRET. Copy No. 3 8CP. (45) 345.13th December, 1945.CABINET.THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCOTLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.MY colleagues have before them a paper by the Minister of Health (CP. (45)339) describing his proposals for a National Health Service in England andWales.   With the general shape of these proposals I am in full agreement.2. Tb.e same objectives and general principles must govern the service inScotland, but differences of geography and local government structure requirecertain modifications in the detailed administrative arrangements, chiefly in thelocal organisation. In this note I indicate very briefly the application of theMinisters proposals to Scotland, mentioning in paragraphs 5 and 6 the principalmodifications.Central Organisation.3. The Secretary of State in Scotland will take the place of the Ministerof Health at the centre. He will absorb the administrative functions of theScottish Board of Control, leaving the Board, as in England, with its quasi-judicial functions relating to the liberty of the subject.4. Scottish central advisory machinery will be established on the same lines as set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement appended to the MinistersPaper. Scotland will also have its own Central Committee on the Distributionof Medical Practices, working as described in paragraphs 41-42 of the statement.Administrative arrangements will be made for liaison between these Scottish-bodies and the corresponding bodies in England and Wales.Local Organisation.5, Health services in Scotland are in the hands of 55 major local authorities.This compares with only 145 major authorities in England and Wales, so thatthe average Scottish authority is smaller in population and resources. In con-sequence the following departures from the Ministers proposals are necessary : (a) In order to avoid complicated inter-area arrangements and to secureflexibility and economy, the ambulance service in Scotland will be associated with the hospital service and administered by the RegionalHospitals Boards (of which there will be 5 in Scotland). Existingvoluntary organisations will be utilised under contract, and airambulance facilities for the remote districts in the north and west of Scotland will also be included.(b) Instead of establishing a Local Executive Committee for the family practitioner services in each major health authority area in Scotland(as proposed for England and Wales), burghs other than the fourcities will, for this purpose, be included wuth the counties in whichthey are situated, and some Committees may cover two or moreadjacent counties.6.   Local authorities have not hitherto been concerned with the general practitioner service, and in Scotland they have not pressed for any part of this1&apos;esponsibility in future.  I feel, therefore, that progress could best be made with[31060]
the -development of Health Centres by adhering to the White Paper proposal that the provision, equipment and maintenance of Health Centres in scotland should be the direct responsibility of the Secretary of State, instead of beingthe responsibility of local authorities as in England and Wales. The Secretaryof State will be empowered to delegate any of his functions in this connectionto a local authority. This was accepted both by the Scottish local authorities andby the medical profession in Scotland in the discussions following on the white paper.Finance.7. The Minister gives, in paragraph 52 of his proposals, estimates of past and future expenditure on health services. Corresponding figures for Scotland,on the same assumptions, are as follows : -Expenditure by Local authorities ...Voluntary hospitalsCentral Department (High-land and Islands medical benefit, &amp;c.)1938-39  million.4-31-41-97-6Met by-N.H.I. contributionsTaxesRatesVoluntary sources ...Expenditure on Hospitals and specialists..Local authority services ..Health centresGeneral practitioner, den-tal and eye servicesCompensation and super-annuationNew Service.  million.10-51-30-24-50-5170Met by Insurance contributionsRatesTaxes       ......  million.1-50-44-41-37-6  million.4-30-712 017-08. If my colleagues agree that these proposals are generally on the rightlines I shall proceed to meet the representative bodies of the Scottish localauthorities and others for some discussion of the principal points, in the same way as the Minister of Health proposes to proceed in England. On major questions affecting the medical profession and the voluntary hospitals, whose representative organisations are on a United Kingdom basis, the Minister and I should jointlymeet delegations representative of the whole country.J. W.Scottish Office, London, S. W. 1.13th December, 1945.
