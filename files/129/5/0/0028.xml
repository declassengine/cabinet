THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET. Copy No,   3CP. (45) 328.4thDecember, 1945.CABINET.MOTIONS OF GRATITUDE TO WAR LEADERS.Memorandum by the Lord President.THE Opposition are not content to accept the Governments decision that parliament should not be asked to thank war leaders by name. They haveapproached the Chief Whip to ascertain whether the Government would beprepared to accept the two Motions contained in Annex A below. Mr. Edensaw me about it on Monday evening (3rd December).I attach (Annex B), for convenience of reference, a summary of the statements which the Prime Minister has made on this question in the House. It will be recalled, too, that the Chiefs of Staff themselves have advised us against thankingindividual leaders by name.The alternatives as I see them are as follows : (1) If the Government comply with the request of the Opposition and themselves put the Motions down, it may appear as though we haveacted under Opposition pressure, especially in view of Mr. ChurchilFsspeech in the House on the 30th October; it may be felt on our sidethat the arguments used by the Prime Minister were conclusive, andthe proposals in the Motions are anti-democratic; and a long time has elapsed since the Vote of Thanks to the Services on the 30th October.(2) If we do not comply with the Opposition^ request, we must be preparedfor them to put the Motions down themselves, as is their present intention.In this event, we shall have to decide (a) whether time should be given for a debate; (&amp;) if so, whether we should oppose the Motions. This might, however,give an impression of churlishness on the part of the Government, and such dis-putation would not be good from the point of view of Service morale. If, on theother hand, we accept them at that stage, we may be placed in a false position,and it would, I think, be far better in that case that we should put them downourselves now.   But I doubt whether the Government supporters would like it.I should perhaps point out that while we can control the question of providingtime in the House of Commons, we could not prevent a discussion in the Houseof Lords if the Opposition put the Motions down there.Will the Cabinet please decide ?H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,4th December, 1945[31005]
