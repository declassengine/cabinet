(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos;OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. 0+5)324 COPY NO  JQ1+TH DECEMBER. 191+5CABINETSHIPPING policy memorandum by the Minister of War transport.      In the discussion of my memorandum CP. (1+5) 299 inthe Lord Presidents Committee on the 30th November(L. P. (1+5)1+5^11 Meeting, Minute 3) my colleagues asked forinformation arising out of my -proposals for control ofBritish shipping after the 2nd March I9I+6, and the disposalof the remainder of our Government owned, tonnage.      in sections 1 and 2 of this paper,  I have further explainedtne background under the headings &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;Disposal&quot;respectively, but I have dealt in a third Section withthe relation of my proposals to our shipbuilding policy,which has been much in my mind in coming to my conclusion.Section    control of British Shipping after 2nd March2.      By the end of this year the tonnage on the UnitedKingdom and Colonial registers (excluding tankers and small ships under 1600 gross tons) will be 12.9 million deadweighttons, compared with a total iri 1939 of 17.7 milliondeadweight tons.      To supplement this,  I have already arranged,  in pursuance of the policy approved by the Cabinetin C.M.(45)29th Conclusions, with the Canadian Governmentto allow me the continued use for 2 or 3 years on bareboatcharter under British flag of about 1 million deadweight tons,I am still seeking to secure for a similar period, about 3 million tons oh bareboat charter from the United States.3.      Before the war we imported, annually about 55 million tons of cargo.      In the war years our imports have been at less than half this rate.      I anticipate a substantial increase in the volume of our imports, but our financial resources and shortage of supplies will set a limit to what we can import in 191+6 far below our pre-war figures,      I amassuming that I shall be asked, to lift programmes for 191+6amounting to about 35 million tons of cargo.1+.      Before the war between 30 and 1+0 per cent of our imports was carried, under foreign flags.      The extent towhich we shall be able to count on foreign flag tonnageduring I9I+6 cannot be precisely estimated,  since tonnage available for world, requirements will depend mainly upon thedecisions of the United. States of America,  and we cannotestimate how quickly the volume of world, trade by sea willrecover, or how far limits will be set by the shortage ofsupplies.      Our European Allies have suffered, shipping losses which will reduce the amount of their shipping available

for our trades;    but trie European Maritime countries will wish to keep the maximum amount possible of their shipping in its accustomed trades, and apart from the natural exchangeof shipping services in the short trades, we may expect theuse of- a substantial amount of this tonnage particularlyNorwegian,  Swedish and. Greek, during 19U.6.      The amountof United. States flag tonnage trading will depend upon thelegislation now before Congress, and. the extent to whichowners in the United. States and. other countries take up theships offered.      The United States Government may not itselfhave power to trade ships for its own account.      In any case,-some American tonnage under private ownership will be trading,.as before the war,  to the U.K. and. in other British trades which will help our programmes.5...     We cannot afford, to dispense with foreign shipping services.      Nor can we as a matter of policy seek to exclude foreign ships from our trades,  especially as welook to restore the earning capacity of British shipping asa world carrier.      An important proportion of our shippingearnings Before the war came from trades entirely between;foreign countries.      Not less than a quarter of our totaltramp earnings was so gained;      and, while the proportionwas less for liners, cargo between foreign ports was an indispensable part of liner economy.      The object of mynegotiations has Been to secure Canadian and. United Statesships on Bareboat charter.      We thus reduce the outgoingsof foreign exchange, serving the difference between grossfreights covering all the costs of operation and thebareboat hire which covers only the capital element in theships.      Despite these charters, we shall still be taking up some foreign flag ships on a gross freight basis and my proposals cover arrangements for regulating the amount.This cannot be measured by the difference between our total requirements of shipping; and. the amount we could, carryourselves if all British tonnage were concentrated, on ourown programmes *      TO restore the earning capacity of our shipping it Is essential to remake as soon as possible brokenshipping connections and. to see some part of our shippingemployed again in world trades.      For the time being, however,I must Be aBle to regulate carefully the amount of snippingunder our own flag v/e can spare for this purpose.6.      These factors all lead, to the conclusion that for sometime after 2nd March I must be  in a position to control theemployment of British shipping, but in a form restoringresponsibility and. initiative to the fullest possible degree to the shipping industry, and. capable of adjustment to-changing circumstances during the transitional period,7.      The general level of freights after 2nd March depends upon factors outside our control.      My proposals includecontinuing powers to control what we pay for the british shipping we require,  and, chartering machinery to regulate the freights for foreign ships.      2 hope to avoid, widedisparity between the freights for British and. foreign ships;but the price of foreign.flag ships will depend upon theworld market.      My department will keep in close touch withthe Treasury and. with the importing Ministries on freightquestions.

8,      As to the amount of our shipping which it will &quot;benecessary to keep under direction for our own imports I agreewith the Ministry of Pood that to begin with it is not likelyto he less than 75% of our tramp shipping and may be as muchas 90%.      My Department&apos; will reach conclusions on this question on examination of the programmes of the importing Ministries.Even if we could; leave only 10% of our tramp shipping to seekgeneral employment in addition to such revival of our linerconnections as may be possible, we should have made a usefulstart in reviving the earning capacity of our tramp industry.Section   2Disposal of Government owned, ships9,      I annex a schedule of the ships available for disposal.The ocean-going dry cargo ships for sale included in groups(1)  and (ii) from the various classes of ship included,(war-time buildings secondhand ships, prises,  etc.,) amount toabout 2.3 million deadweight tons, representing.nearly onefifth of our non-tanker fleet.10.    Much of this tonnage will be needed, to make good forthe time being the serious gaps in our liner fleet,  so as toenable the liner companies to reinstate their services.Before the war we had 8,3 million gross tons of liner shippingexcluding large passenger liners;    the figure today is .3,million gross tons.      In terms of deadweight this reduction;L - about 1+ million tons.      The tramp tonnage available for disposal represents about one-third of our total tramp tonnage.Thus our disposal policy is of fundamental importance to our shipping and. our decisions will vitally affect its competitive power in world trade immediately and for some years to come.I consider it necessary to offer to the industry, on which we propose to rely to restore our shipping earnings, all ourserviceable tonnage upon terms which give a fair chance to compete with foreign flags.      In determining the price Ihave therefore proposed, to have regard to comparable american and. Canadian offers of tonnage, which must be regarded, assetting the market for these types,    I deal in Section 3 withthe effect of my proposals upon the prospects of the shipbuilding industry.11.    The suggestion that it might bo fairer to distribute the better class ships (group (i)) cn a proportionate basis to owners who had. lost most ships during the war, rather than tothe highest bidder above a minimum price, would, reproduce a feature of the scheme which has been in-operation during thewar.      I considered, whether this should, be continued,      Idecided against -it for the reasons that owners have already beengiven opportunities under the existing disposal scheme to take-up LsLipo on a rota of loss and under the building scheme toobtain priority,&apos; and. that the new scheme must be forward,looking,- to give every&apos;opportunity to enterprising owners,rather than backward, looking to restore the previous state ofof affairs.      Moreover, while we must establish a minimum price to protect the Exchequer and give owners a firm basis onwhich to estimate I should, prefer on these better class ships to let Individual owners determine what they would, bo preparedto pay by reference to the prospects of their trade.      these ships may prove more valuable in some trades,  e,g,  to restoreour connections in the profitable dollar trades,  than in others;

and we should not deprive owners engaged in these tradesfrom taking up the ships if they are prepared to pay a betterprice for them than other owners who might have a prior claim on the basis of loss during the war.      I do -not&apos;expect theshipping industry to quarrel with this view.Section   3Relation of my proposals to Shipbuilding -policy12.    The First Lord of the Admiralty has rightly called attention to the- necessity for doing nothing as regardscontrol of our shipping after 2nd March and our disposalpolicy to hinder the prospects of a high level of activity in our building yards over a long period of years.      I had this consideration,, in relation to the Shipbuilding Committee^Report, much in mind, in framing the proposals in C. P. (1+5) 299*13.    The willingness and. ability of our shipowners to placefurther orders for hew ships must partly depend, upon certaintyas to our own disposal policy.      For this reason,  I am anxious to announce the. Government&apos;s disposal policy at anearly date.      Moreover,  if our shipowners are to buildexpensive modern ships of competitive types, they areentitled to such assurance as it is in our power to give thatthey will be able to trade their ships with the greatestdegree of freedom and a minimum of control over employment.While we cannot remove such control for the time being,  and -the industry will not expect it, my proposals make a startin the right direction by restoring financial responsibility.The factors which determine the profitability of shipping-enterprise in the coming years do not of course,  lie whollyin our control;    but in our shipping policy as described in Part 1 of C. P. (1+5) 299,  and in my earlier paper C. P. (1+5) 135?I am doing all I can to promote stable conditions for.shipping.      An announcement of Government policy on thelines I propose should tend to confirm and strengthen thedesire of the shipping industry to build, first class ships in our yards.11+.    Our policy of seeking the tonnage help we must have forthe time being from United States and Canada by bareboatchartering for a few years, rather than by purchase, was designed to avoid burdening ourselves permanently with thesewar-built types as well as from anxiety to economise dollars.These charters will help us to meet our requirements and toremake our shipping connections while new building is proceeding in this country.15.    While- anxious to encourage shipbuilding ordersImmediately, we should not concentrate too much of ourbuilding in the early post-war years, with the risk of subsequent slump in orders.      This was a consideration towhich the Shipbuilding Committee attached great importance.Thus temporary means of providing shipowners with the tonnagethey need without absorbing their capital resources should, be offered, wherever possible.      It is for this reason that Ihave proposed, as regards the ships in group (ii) of mydisposal scheme to offer owners the alternative of bareboatcharter for a period of years.      This group includes a largeproportion of the total we have for disposal.

16.    I considered whether in offering for sale the goodships in group  (i) and in offering the option to buy ships in group (ii)  I should be covering an unduly large proportionof the replacement required, from buildings.      The gap in ourpre-war liner fleet excluding passenger liners at the end ofthe present year will be some 3 million gross tons.      against this we have to offer only about a quarter million gross tonsof new liners and a rather smaller quantity of second, handships of this &quot;type.      As regards our heavily depleted, tramptonnage, my offer of &quot;bareboat charter should open possibilities for building,  so soon as the world, situation in the trampmarket is clarified.      I hope my colleagues will agree therefore that my proposals to meet our immediate needs will cause theminimum of disturbance to the flow of shipbuilding orders.17-    The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested, that sales ofGovernment owned, ships should be conditional upon buyers notcancelling orders for new buildings.      I should not expectray proposals to result in any cancellations or orders alreadyplaced, but I see no difficulty in meeting the   First Lord1spoint by making it a condition of sale to a particular ownerat the new disposal price that he must not cancel an orderalready placed, for a new building in this country.18.    As we propose to fix prices for our ships j&amp;ycomparison with the prices at which United States and canadian tonnage Is offered, there is little risk ofspeculative buying ise order to take a quick profit..     Wehave a safeguard, against this in the Transfer Restriction Actand. I should propose to make it clear to purchasers thatthe powers would be used, if need, be in order to prevent such-speculative transactions in disposal scheme ships.19-    The schedule annexed, includes the British share of theGerman fleet,  the total of which is put at about 300,000gross tons.      Until the discussions with our Allies are completed we cannot say what the final figure will Be norwhich ships will fall to our share.      These ships will haveto be valued separately later for the purposes of thedisposal scheme, in consultation with the Treasury and. theAdmiralty.20.    The First Lord of the Admiralty authorises me to saythat he is in agreement with Section 3 of this paper.A. B.Ministry of War Transport,UTH DECEMBER,19h7
