THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOIFERNJVIENT       printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.f  I SECRET. Copy No. u uCP. (45) 302.24 A November, 1945.CABINET.FOOD SUPPLIES FOR GERMANY.Report by the Lord President of the Council.11        AT their meeting on the 30th October (CM. (45) 47th Conclusions, Minute 4)B the Cabinet invited the Lord Presidents Committee to consider the problem ofIf food supplies for Germany and to focus the issues for decision by the Cabinet.iBf The Committee gave preliminary consideration to the problem at a meeting onill the 5th November (L.P. (45) 41st Meeting, Minute 1) and reached certain provi-sional decisions which were reported to the Prime Minister.   The Committeehave now given further consideration to the problem in the light of the reportby the mission appointed by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to considerthe wheat requirements of the British zone in Germany up to mid-1946.2. While there is still room for improvement in the administrative measures for making the best use of food available, we are satisfied that very serious consequences to nutrition and indirectly to the economic, political and security situation in Germany will follow unless cereal shipments are made to germany during the coming 8 months on approximately the scale and time-table recom-mended by the Mission, namely : &apos;Tons.December/January, 250,000 tons monthbr ...      ...      500,000February,&apos;190,000 tons       ...      ...      ...      ...      190,000March/July inclusive, 165,000 tons monthly      ...      825,000Total for the 8 months .........    1,515,0003. Towards this, procurement is in hand in the United States of 112,500 tons,which it is now agreed should be shipped to Germany. The Treasury hasfurnished the necessary dollars for this instalment, but the Ministry of war transport will not be able to ship more than 60,000 tons in December withoutprejudice to other programmes outwards from North America unless Americantonnage is forthcoming for this purpose.4. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has authorised dollar expenditure on a further 275,000 tons of wheat (or flour equivalent), as soon assupplies can be obtained and shipping made available.5. We have considered suggestions that the dangerous prospective gap inarrivals in Germany during December /January might be partly or whollybridged by either an outright release or a temporary loan of wheat and/or flourfrom United Kingdom stocks, and cargoes afloat.6. The Minister of Food has, however, produced figures to show that in viewof the uncertainty of replacement (owing to the world wheat deficiency) and ofthe anticipated low level of United Kingdom stocks in the early summer of 1946,.this risk of being compelled to reduce consumption cannot be accepted on top ofthe risks already incurred by recent releases for the same purpose.7.   The Minister of Food has invited the exporting countries to reduce their stocks below the International Wheat Agreement minimum levels in order to freemore wheat for export; and it is believed that, at least in the case of the UnitedStates, a sympathetic response may be expected.[30944]
8. The European Economic Committee has invited the importing countries represented on it to economise wheat by raising their extraction rates to 85 per \cent, in those cases (United Kingdom, Belgium and Denmark) where la lower &apos;percentage is in force at present. We have, however, been unable to recommendthat the United Kingdom extraction rate should revert from the present 80 percent, to 85 per cent, to meet this request in view of the serious consequences-toour livestock policy which would ensue and the need for keeping something inhand against future risks with which we are faced. .9. There is no possibility of obtaining extra wheat exports from canada and Australia over the amount needed to cover their existing commitments, whichare mainly to the British Commonwealth.10. The Foreign Secretary has asked for support from Mr. Byrnes in thesupply of coal to the Argentine in order to bring down more cereals to the ports and to release grain at present being burnt as locomotive fuel.11. The positive measures described in paragraphs 3 and 4 will yield only387,500 tons towards the total 8 months&apos; requirements of 1,515,000. Expectationsfrom the Argentine are problematical. The balance, probably exceeding1 million tons, is beyond British resources, and we consider that an approach should be made to the United States Government on a high level pointing outthat (i) While we have the immediate administrative responsibility for feeding.     25 million Germans, the threat of famine in our zone is one which wedo not command enough food resources, shipping or foreign exchangeto meet.(ii) The threatened catastrophe is in no sense a strictly British but isdefinitely a United Nations&apos; concern because if it is not checked thepolitical settlement of Europe and the withdrawal of occupying forcesmay be indefinitely postponed; the Potsdam scheme for meetingEurope&apos;s coal needs by reviving Ruhr production may be nullified, andepidemics may be started whose spread it will be impossible to control:(iii) The United States Government can help in four ways : (a) by recognising the prevention of famine in Germany as a matterof urgent United Nations concern on which they will assumetheir appropriate share;(&amp;) by intensified efforts to increase exports of wheat from the UnitedStates for human consumption;(c) by assisting with provision of snipping; and(d) by bearing the cost of supplying United States wheat for theBritish zone over and above the amount shown in paragraphs 3and 4 which will be borne by the United KingdomGovernment.(iv) If, in principle, the United States Government agree that thisemergency should be handled as an inter-governmental matter, theyshould instruct their representatives on the Combined Food Board andon the United Maritime Authority to work out the necessary arrangements.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,24th November, 1945.
