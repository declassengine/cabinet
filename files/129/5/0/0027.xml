VictoriousH.M.S.IndefatigableH.M.S. ImplacableThe British Pacific Fleet, operating as Task Force 37with the American 3rd Fleet in air strikes on the mainJapanese Islands, commenced refuelling on the 30th July.Owing to a typhoon, fuelling was not completed until the3rd August and then operations were further delayedwhile the atomic bomb attacks were carried out. reports were received of concentrations of Japanese aircraft inNorthern Honshu and Hokkaido, so preparations weremade to attack these areas at dawn on the 8th. Fogand low cloud prevented an attack that day, the onlyactivity being the shooting down of two enemyreconnaissance aircraft. On the 9th and 10th, from the flying-off positions, slightly further south and clear offog, both the British and American forces struck atHonshu. On the first day our aircraft sank a destroyeroff Onagawa and damaged two destroyer escorts and anet layer; they also destroyed 48 aircraft and 24 glidersand damaged 39 more aircraft, all on the ground. Heavyunits of Task Force 37, in company with an AmericanTask Unit, bombarded Kamaishi on the north-east coast of Honshu for If hours and started fires in the dock area. Nine more grounded enemy aircraft were destroyed and 14 damaged by air strikes on the 10th,when our aircraft also shared in damaging 4 merchant ships.Having been continuously at sea since the 6th July,Task Force 37 was now overdue to return to base for a major replenishment, but with the prospect of peace atany moment a Task Group, containing the Indefatigableand other units of the Fleet, was left to continue the attack. This Task Group (now numbered TaskGroup 38 - 5) operated directly with the American TaskForce and on the 13th August took part in the dawnattack on the Tokyo Plains. During that day 22 enemy aircraft were shot down, 254 were destroyed and 147damaged on the ground, and 14 large merchant vessels and 2 submarines were sunk by the combined force.[30978]
. - On the 1.4th the Force fuelled and at dawn the next day further strikes were launched against the TokyoPlains area. Twenty-six aircraft were shot down and 6destroyed on the ground in the short time before furtheroffensive operations were cancelled on the acceptance of... peace terms by the enemy.   After the cease fire was.     sounded, 8 enemy aircraft approached the Force in a hostile manner and all were shot down.So ended the third and final phase of Operation&quot; Iceberg.&quot; Since the British Pacific Fleet had sortiedfrom Ulithi on the 18th March, 1945, to open Phased ofthe operation our aircraft had attacked the enemy on33 strike days, flying 7,255 sorties of all types, dropping1,387-1 tons 01 bombs, firing 1,013 rocket projectiles andinflicting losses on the enemy to the extent of288-^ aircraft -destroyed and 247 damaged, causing considerable damage and dislocation to the enemy&apos;sindustries and communications and sinking or severelydamaging 309 of the enemy&apos;s ships, both warships and merchant vessels, totalling in all 356,760 tons. Thesesuccesses were obtained with very small losses in aircraft and, despite all the efforts of suicide bombers, withoutthe loss of a single ship.H.M.S. At   the   conclusion  of   these   operations   H.M.S.Indefatigable Indefatigable was one of the British ships to anchor in tokyo Bay.2. Light Fleet Carriers.H.M.S. VenerableH.M.S. VengeanceH.M.S. ColossusH.M.S. GloryIn August the light fleet carriers Colossus, Venerableand Vengeance were formed into Carrier Task Group 111with H.M.S. Indomitable as the flagship and, but forthe sudden cessation of hostilities, these ships would undoubtedly have played a prominent part in the air war against Japan. They arrived at Manus from Sydney onthe 20th August. The Group then split into two TaskUnits and the Indomitable and Venerable went on to hong Kong via Subic, arriving there on the30th August. The Indomitable entered first, while theVenerable remained at sea and provided continuous airpatrols, but there was no opposition.The Colossus provided air cover for the occupation ofKiirun on the 6th September and then went on to shangai, arriving there on the 19th.This ship arrived at Sydney on the 22nd August tojoin the British Pacific Fleet. On the 1st September sheleft for New Britain and, as the ship was at anchor inJacquinor Bay the surrender of the Japanese South-Eastern Army and Navy was signed on board.3. Aircraft Maintenance Ships.H.M.S. Unicorn These ships have contributed greatly to the success ofH.M.S. Pioneer        the British Pacific Fleet in carrying out efficiently theirunspectacular duties of repair and replenishment.4. Escort Carriers.(i) The assault carriers Ameer, Emperor, Empress, Khedive and Shah ofthe East Indies Fleet, left Trincomalee on the 10th August to attack airfields and shipping in the Penang and Medan areas but, on the acceptance of peace terms,the operation was cancelled and all the ships returned to Trincomalee on the15th August.(ii) Attacker, Hunter, Stalker and Shah left Trincomalee on the 17th august to assist in the occupation of Penang, which was carried out without opposition. Hunter and Stalker were then released to take part in operation&quot; Zipper.&quot;
(iii) Operation &quot;Zipper&quot; had been planned as a seaborne assault on the malay Peninsula but peace was declared before it could be launched. The plan was modified to make the occupation of Port Swettenham the main objective and two forces of escort carriers took part; Force 64, comprising H.M. ShipsAmeer, Emperor, Empress and Khedive, and Force 65 comprising H.M. ShipsAttacker, Hunter, Stalker and Begum. For practice purposes the operation wascarried out as though in the face of opposition and air support sorties were flown by aircraft from the escort carriers. The enemy did not attempt to oppose the landings. H.M.S. Attacker was detached to provide air cover for a mine-sweeping operation north of Singapore.(iv) The replenishment carriers of the British Pacific Fleet, H.M. ShipsArbiter, Slinger, Speaker, Chaser, Striker and Ruler forming Task Force 112supported the Fleet operations off Japan in early August and then returned toManus.A. V.
