SMBOgDgp, 1S THE PROPERTY 0F HIS BRTTfl MMTfi ^^^^ .Printed for the Cabinet. December 1945. 204SECRET. rnnv nn  - O- Copy No.     00CP. (45) 355.31st December, 1945.CABINET.ELECTIONS IN GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY- colleagues will recollect that, in company with the United StatesGovernment and the French Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed tosend .an international commission to observe the forthcoming Greek elections and that Mr. Windle was appointed to head the British group.2. I recommend that we should now approach the American and french governments recommending that we should jointly advise the Greek Governmentto make a firm and final declaration that the elections will be held, as nowproposed, on the 31st March by a system of proportional representation inaccordance with the existing law.3. Mr. Windie, together with his American and French colleagues, paid a preliminary visit to Greece shortly before Christmas. They have reported thatthe Greek Government have decided to hold the elections on the 31st March, butthat there is some misgiving in Greece concerning the fairness of the electoralregister. This is fully recognised by the existing Government who have arranged for the register to be laid open for an additional period beyond that provided forby the previous Governments regulations. Mr. Windle feels that there is noreason to think that when this has been done the register will be any less fairthan in any other Greek election and probably considerably fairer. The Corn-mission will be able to satisfy themselves on this question when they return to greece.4. As a result of the Commission^ visit a plan has been drawn up andtentatively agreed between the British, American and French heads of theCommission setting out the procedure which the Commission should follow inobserving the elections. Under this plan Greece would, for observation purposes,be divided into five districts with headquarters situated at Athens, Salonika,Patras, Tripolis and Heraklion. The central headquarters would be in Athensand the subordinate headquarters would be presided over by individual membersof the Commission. To enable this to be clone the British, American and FrenchMissions would each have to number six persons and I am considering some further appointments to the British Mission to bring it up to this figure. It isproposed that under the various regional headquarters a number of observationteams should observe the electoral process. The tentative plan is that there shouldbe 100 American, 100 British and possibly 40 French observation teams. Suchteams can, in present circumstances, only be drawn conveniently from militarysources and both the American and French Missions are arranging for thenecessary military personnel to be available. Each team would consist of oneofficer, one private and an interpreter each equipped with a vehicle. These teamswould be used during the period prior to the elections to inspect the electoralregisters and such arrangements as have been made by the Greek Governmentfor the conduct of the elections. On election day the teams would be sent to asufficient number of representative polling places to give a sample of the effective-ness and integrity of the election procedure. Each team will be composed of personnel of one nationality only, but the teams will be interspersed so that therewill be teams of each nationality in each of the five districts.13084   [31097]
5. It has been tentatively estimated that the British requirements will beabout 120 officers and 130 other ranks together with the necessary transport.I understand that the greater part of these requirements can be obtainedfrom the forces already in Greece or from Italy. It is, however, essential thatthe British Mission should contain a major-general who would look after thenecessary military arrangements and be able to treat on equal terms with thehigh-ranking military officers appointed by the French and American Missions.The Secretary of State for War has been asked to make a suitable officeravailable.6. It is the view of the Commission that the military personnel required forthe observation of the elections should be assembled in Italy, where, before pro-ceeding to Greece, they would receive a short course of instruction designed to give them the background of the present situation in Greece and to equip themsufficiently to carry out their tasks as election observers.7. This plan will undoubtedly be expensive -the Americans speak of spending some $900,000 on their part of the operation. In view of the fact thatthere is already much British personnel and equipment on the spot, I should not expect the British expenses to be so high. I am, however, convinced that it isessential that we should see that these Greek elections are efficiently and fairlycarried out and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be justified in incurringany necessary expenditure to bring about this result.8. I am accordingly proposing to inform the American Government thatwe are in general agreement with the tentative plan drawn up during thepreliminary visit of the Commission to Greece and that Mr. Winclle will beauthorised to agree a final plan on the lines proposed.9. Finally, there is the question of the method of election. My colleagues will be aware that there has been considerable dispute in Greece as to whetherthe elections should be by a system of proportional representation or by a majoritysystem. It was outside the terms of reference of the Commission, which is purelyan observing body, to give advice on this subject to the Greek Government.Mr. Windle, however, formed the impression that it would lead to considerable further delay in holding the elections if the existing electoral law, which providesfor elections by means of proportional representation, were to be changed. Itwould, among other things, involve dividing up the country into single-member constituencies. If the proportional representation system is adopted, there will undoubtedly be protests from the Greek Eight-wing parties, who feel that that system will give undue advantage to their Left-wing opponents. I do not,however, feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government should intervene to bring about any change in the existing law, since if the result were to be an overwhelmingvictory for the Right-wing parties we should be accused both at home and abroadof having &quot;cooked&quot; the elections to suit our own purposes. His Majesty&apos;ambassador&apos;s impression is that it is being generally taken for granted that theexisting law will not be changed and that any attempt to change it would causemore of an upheaval than leaving things as they are. Sir R. Leeper also pointsout that the Royalists have not got a strong case because this was the law in force at the last elections for the return of the King.E.
