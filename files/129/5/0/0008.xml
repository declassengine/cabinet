TEIlJggg!EggT 18 PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1045.secret copy No.CP. ($5) 308.27*A November, 1945.CABINET.INTER-TERRITORIAL  ORGANISATION  IN  EAST  AFRICA.Note by the Secretary, of State for the Colonies.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the annexed note by theLord Privy Seal, Chairman of the Colonial Affairs Committee, on proposals forthe establishment of an East African Commission, an East African legislativeassembly and ancillary machinery for the operation of certain common services in kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika.The Governor of Kenya, who was in this country for discussions on the pro-posals, has now returned to East Africa. With my authority, he made a state-ment to his Legislative Council on the 26th November to say that proposals willbe published in the immediate future.A copy of the proposals as issued will be sent to the Government of India atthe time of publication, and they will thus have the opportunity of making any comments they wish before the scheme is carried into effect. Copies will, at thesame time, be forwarded to the Dominion Governments and the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia.NOW that the war is over, it is urgently necessary that the common services in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, at present operated under the east african Governors&apos; Conference, should be placed on a proper footing. Theexisting organisation has grown up gradually over a period of years to meetthe growing need for co-ordination in peace-time and, more recently, toenable the Territories to make their maximum contribution to the war effort.A number of common Services have been established on a permanent basis; others have been added in war-time and derive their authority from Defence Regula-tions. Apart from this there is no constitutional basis for the common services, nor is there any effective means of securing the backing of publicopinion for their operations. In cases where common legislation covering thethree Territories is required, recourse has to be had to the cumbrous procedure of passing Bills through all three territorial Legislative Councils and uniformitycan be ensured only by presenting the Councils with what amounts in effect to a fait accompli. The present state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue in.peace-time and, unless means can be found of remedying the existing defects, the machine may well break down.2. The three Governors, after discussion, have submitted agreed proposalsfor dealing with the situation, which the Secretary of State for the ColoniesG. H. H.Colonial Offoce, Downing Street, S.W. 1,27th November, 1945.ANNEX.Note by the Lord Privy Seal.[30957]
has discussed personally with Sir Philip Mitchell, Governor of Kenya andChairman of the Governors&apos; Conference, and Sir Charles Lockhart, its chief secretary. They think that the scheme, as it has emerged from discussions with the Colonial Office, would have a good chance of being generally accepted in East Africa. It is accordingly suggested that the proposals should now bepublished as a basis for discussion.3.   The main features of the proposals are as follows :-(1) An East African High Commission would be established, consistingof the three Governors under the chairmanship of the Governor of kenya, which would be responsible to the Secretary of State for theColonies for the operation of the common services.(2) The High Commission would be supported by an executive consistingof a central secretariat and departments.(3) In close co-operation with the executive would work a number of inter-territorial advisory boards, most of which exist already and each ofwhich would be associated with one of the principal officers of theexecutive for the operation of a particular service.(4) An East African legislative assembly would be established to legislate for the common services and in certain other matters, mostly economic,where common legislation is essential. The powers of this legislativeassembly would be strictly defined by Order in Council in order thatit should not conflict with the territorial Legislative Councils.(5) The common services operated in this way would be those existing atpresent with two main additions. The existing common services aredefence, posts and telegraphs, income tax, meteorology, civil aviation,currency, statistics, research, higher education, the anti-locust and anti-tsetse services and the war-time organisation for production and supply (to be replaced in due course by whatever inter-territorialeconomic organisation it is decided to establish on a permanent basis).In addition the Tanganyika Railways would be combined with the kenya and Uganda Railways, while the co-ordination of plans forinter-territorial trunk roads would be secured by central machinery.The Tanganyika Customs Department would be amalgamated withthe existing combined Kenya and Uganda Customs Department.There is already a customs union between the three Territories anda common tariff.4.   The following points are of importance : -(1) His Majesty&apos;s Government would retain, as at. present, the ultimate responsibility to Parliament for the operation of the High Corn-mission, which would report to the Secretary of State for the Coloniesjust as a Colonial Governor does in the normal course. although there would be an unofficial majority in the legislative assembly, theusual reserve powers would be given to the High Commission.(2) The proposals do not involve either political closer union or the fusionof the three Governments. There does not exist in East Africa either the community of interest or the public support which alone would justify embarking on a scheme of closer union in the political senseand any attempt to do so at present would involve reviving the con-troversies of the nineteen-twenties. It is doubtful, moreover, whethercloser union in the political sense would be generally acceptable in thiscountry.(3) The administration of the Territories would therefore be left with thethree Governments as at present and the Territories would retain their existing constitutions. The three Governments would remain responsible for the basic administrative, social and. developmentservices.5. It may be asked why it is necessary to establish an East African legisla-tive assembly and why the association of the public with the operation of thecommon services cannot be obtained through the inter-territorial boards whichform part of the scheme. There are three reasons why we regard a legislativeassembly as necessary. In the first place the boards would not get over the present difficulty of having to pass common legislation through three Legislative Councils.Secondly, while the boards provide an excellent means of obtaining public
co-operation in the actual operation of the common services, they are not theright place for the discussion of broad issues of policy affecting these Services.To obtain the full backing of public opinion a legislature is necessary. Thirdly,the legislative assembly would provide the ideal means of associating all raceswith the work of the High Commission and central executive. It is proposedthat, in the representation of races among the unofficial members, Europeans,Africans and Indians should have equal numbers, although, owing to shortageof suitable people, not all the representatives of Africans would be Africans inthe first instance.6. The scheme would in no way be incompatible with the maintenance ofthe existing arrangements for consultation on matters of common interest, withwhich the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the British Resi-dent in Zanzibar, as well as the East African Governors, are associated. Ifdesirable, the Secretary of State for the Colonies or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary could preside from time to time at such consultative meetings, in asimilar way to that proposed for West Africa. But the difference between theWest African Council and the proposed East African High Commission is thatthe former is designed for consultation, whereas the latter would be an executiveagency for the operation of common services.7. We are advised that the proposals are in no way inconsistent with theexisting mandate for Tanganyika or with the trusteeship section in the united nations Charter.8. We are satisfied that the scheme would provide an improved workablebasis for the continued operation of the common services and would secure more effective machinery for co-ordination, particularly in the sphere of economic affairs and communications. There is reason to believe that the proposals would stand a good chance of being acceptable to public opinion locally, and we agree that they should be published forthwith as a basis for public discussion.On behalf of Colonial Affairs Committee,A. G.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,lQth November, 1945.
