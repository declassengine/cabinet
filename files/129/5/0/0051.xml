Althoughdevelopments at the Moscow Conference will, I hope, enable rapid progress tobe made with the Italian Peace Treaty, difficulties may yet arise and it isconceivable that it may still be necessary to take some action on the lines suggested a   in this paper.  I therefore think that it would be useful for my colleagues to see[1   the paper although no immediate decision is required.E. B.Foreign Office, 28th December, 1945.Conclusions.1. I invite my colleagues to agree that in the event of the conversations in moscow offering no prospect of progress in the matter of the Peace Treaties with italy and the ex-Satellite States, His Majesty&apos;s Government should (a) Agree with the United States Governments proposal to revise the ItalianArmistice Terms, provided that this means preserving and codifyingall that is essential pending the conclusions of a peace treaty andscrapping what is out of date or unnecessary.(b) Propose to the United States Government to go further, by terminating the present technical state of war with Italy in order to meet thejustifiable complaints of the Italian Government in this matter.(c) For this purpose propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government should make separately a public declaration to theeffect that, while maintaining their own rights and those of the united nations under the revised Armistice, and reserving all questions and claims which must remain unsettled until decided in the Peace Treaty,they consider, notwithstanding the absence of such a peace treaty,that the technical state of war with Italy is now at an end and theyare ready from now on to resume full normal diplomatic relations with italy. The French Government and the Dominion Governments shouldbe invited to make a similar declaration.(d) At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment should negotiate agreements with the Italian Govern-ment on the basis of equality to provide for (i) the continued presence in Italy of British and American troops and troops under British command;(ii) the continued holding of Italian prisoners of war in British, and,if necessary, American hands in the same conditions as hithertopending repatriation.(e) After (c) and (d) have been completed, consider, in consultation withthe United States, whether we could not raise the question of admitting Italy as one of the United Nations without waiting for theconclusion of a peace treaty. Even if the Soviet Government objectedon the strength of the Potsdam Resolution dealing with this matterit might be good tactics on our part to have proposed it.13078   [31082]
C onsiderations.2. The breakdown of the Council of Foreign Ministers has made itimpossible to proceed to the conclusion of a final peace treaty with Italy. I hopethat the Moscow talks may result in the machinery of the Council being set in motion again or in some alternative method of handling Peace Settlements being-devised. But, if not, I consider it most important from the point of view of anglo-Italian relations and in view of the disturbing trend of Italian internal affairs that some interim steps should be taken immediately towards the regu-larisation of Italy&apos;s international status.3. One possibility would be to conclude some kind of provisional or interimpeace treaty. This would, however, require time and involve possibly difficultdiscussions with the other Allied Governments, notably the Soviet Government.Furthermore, any interim peace treaty would have to include provisions whereby the Italian Government bound themselves to observe such decisions as might betaken in the eventual final peace treaty in respect of the Italian colonies, theItalian fleet, reparations, &amp;c. Such provisions would hardly make the interimpeace treaty very palatable to any Italian Government, or improve the latter&apos;sstanding with its own public opinion.4. The Italian Government have requested that the present armistice regimeshould be revised. They have not yet given any precise indication of what theymean by this request, but from a communication made recently by Count Caran-dini it is evident that what they chiefly hope for is the modification of Article 23of the Additional Conditions of Armistice in so far as it requires the ItalianGovernment to meet all the Allied costs of occupation. I consider that in the altered circumstances the time has come to find a new basis for the retention ofAllied troops in Italy and as far as possible to treat Italy in this respect in thesame way as Allied countries of Europe in which we maintain troops see para. below.5. In the meantime the United States Government have informed the ItalianGovernment that they are prepared to agree to the revision of the armisticeregime, provided that the other signatory Powers agree also. They have accord-ingly asked His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Government to concur andhave promised to submit a draft of an agreement with the Italian Governmentfor our consideration. Pending the receipt of this draft we do not know exactly what is in the mind of the United States Government. To judge from earliercommunications, howrever, it seems more than likely luhat they merely contemplatecancelling those clauses of the Armistice which are already virtually obsolete andretaining probably in a fresh document agreed to by the Italian Government those fairly numerous clauses which are still of value to the Allied Governments.It must, I think, be very doubtful whether such a proposal would give satisfaction to the Italian Government, nor in my view would any document of this sort likelyto give any satisfaction to the Italian Government, adequately safeguard therights either of ourselves or of the other Allies.6. I am of the opinion, therefore, that as soon as we receive details of theAmerican proposals and have examined them we should tell the Americans thatwe are quite ready to go along with them and see whether some arrangement onthese lines can be reached to the satisfaction both of the Allies and the Italians;but that we should at the same time propose further action in the direction ofactually terminating the technical state of war. Even if this action makes no great practical difference in our relations with Italy, it alone will give the Italianpeople the formal satisfaction to which they feel entitled after having fought onour side and after having been treated as co-belligerents for the last two years.7. For this purpose I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should proposeto the United States Government that the two Governments should make publicdeclarations to the effect that the technical state of war between our two countries and Italy is now at an end. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned,our declaration would also state that we are prepared from now onwards to resume full normal diplomatic relations with Italy. This point would presumablynot appear in the United States declaration since, although they have not yetterminated the state of war, the United States Government have an apparentlyfully accredited Ambassador in Italy. Our own representative, Sir N. Charles,has, of course, only the personal rank of Ambassador. Both Governments would,however, have to word the declarations so as to maintain all their rights and those\
of our Allies under the revised Armistice and to reserve all questions and claims which must remain unsettled until decided in the Peace Treaty.. In this connexionI should have wished that Italian prisoners of war could be given some new status,either as members of an Allied armed force temporarily on British territory, or as civilians receiving a contract wage, but I understand that the practical difficul-ties are considerable, and I therefore propose, in paragraph 9 below, an alternativearrangement which I hope may to some extent counteract the otherwise unfortunate effect of our retaining Italians as prisoners of war after the termination of thetechnical state of war. At all events, I consider it important that individualItalians should cease to be regarded as enemy persons and should be subject asregards residence, &amp;c, only to such regulations as apply to other non-enemy aliens.The Soviet and French Governments and the Dominion Governments would haveto be given an opportunity to make a similar declaration, and in order that all his Majesty&apos;s Governments may agree upon a common line, consultation with theDominion Governments should take place before our proposal is put to the UnitedStates Government. Thereafter, if the United States Government accepted our proposal, the Soviet and French Governments would be notified sufficiently long inadvance to enable them to take similar action, if they so wished, at the same time as ourselves. Our intentions would also have to be explained in advance to theother Allied Governments which have taken an active part in the war against italy.8. At the same time we should proceed in concert with the united StatesGovernment to negotiate agreements with the Italian Government providing forthe continued presence of British and American troops in Italy. Hitherto it hasbeen our intention to conclude such agreements on the signature of a peace treaty and considerable progress has already been made in the preparations of drafts.With one or two modifications these drafts will serve equally well as the basis of agreements to be concluded now. These agreements would provide for the rightof His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain troops in Italy in connexion with theinter-Allied occupation of Austria and Venezia Giulia, or with the maintenanceof lines of communication with forces in the Mediterranean area and in the far east, and would lay down the facilities, privileges and legal immunities to beenjoyed by the forces whilst on Italian soil. The agreements could be repre-sented as negotiated with the Italian Government on a basis of equality and represented as a contribution by Italy to the general world settlement ratherthan as a result of her defeat and occupation. It is, however, essential in my view that the agreements should place Italy on a par with the Allied Govern-ments with whom we have similar agreements, and that, therefore, as regardsthe financial provisions, we should offset the local pay of British troops in Italyand the value of any supplies and services provided by the Italian government under the terms of the agreements against Italy&apos;s debts to ourselves, and shouldalso be ready to allow the Italian Government a sterling credit in respect of thetroops&apos; pay should this appear desirable in the course of the negotiations. TheUnited States Government are already prepared to do this; it is only a questionof our doing likewise.9. The available estimates of the rate of repatriation suggest that veryconsiderable Italian prisoners of war will still be in British hands by the middleof 1946, and perhaps even later, and it may be difficult to reconcile this state ofaffairs with the termination of the technical state of war with Italy. There is,of course, the possibility of Italians in this country, who would otherwise be repatriated, being given a contract for wages, which I brought to the Cabinet&apos;attention on the 6th November. This is now being investigated by a Committeeof Officials set up by the Ministry of Labour, but I understand that it presentsconsiderable difficulties. In any case it relates only to Italians who would other-wise be repatriated, and not to the much larger category who cannot be repatriatedfor lack of shipping. In regard to these men the difficulties are presumablygreater still. I have also considered the possibility of the prisoners being treatedas a part of the Italian Armed Forces temporarily in this country, and even oftheir being enrolled in our own Pioneer Corps. From discussions between theForeign Office and the War Office, however, it would appear that both these alternatives are open to serious objection. Moreover, most of the Italians arenot in the United Kingdom but in the Dominions, India, North Africa and Egypt,where any of the concessions discussed above would certainly meet with theneatest opposition. In these circumstances I feel that the only practicable courseof action is to make every effort to accelerate the rate of repatriation from all theatres by ensuring a higher priority for shipping for this purpose, and to
continue to treat the Italians, wherever held, as technically prisoners of war until they are sent home. This would not, I think, prevent some of them being retainedon a contract of wages when their turn for repatriation came, should this bethought desirable as a result of the findings of the Committee of Officials referredto above. In order, however, to reduce the possible unfortunate effect of keeping the Italians here in the status of prisoner of war after the termination of thetechnical state of war, I propose that we should ask the Italian Government to conclude an agreement in the matter as between equals. In this agreement HisMajesty&apos;s Government would reaffirm their promise to repatriate the Italiansas soon as possible. There would be a reference to the difficulties in the way ofany change of status and the Italian Government would agree that on practicalgrounds the best thing would be to maintain the existing arrangements. Finally,it would be pointed out that the status of prisoners of war was &quot; technical &quot;only and did not really reflect the real attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government tothe Italians who were now nationals of a friendly power.I doubt whether it would be necessary for the United States Government,who have been repatriating Italian prisoners of war for some time past, to conclude any such agreement, but I would propose to inform them in advanceof our intentions. The Dominions and India would certainly have to be consulted and might be asked whether they would wish to be associated with any agree-ment concluded by the United Kingdom Government.10. If we take action in the sense indicated in paragraphs 7 and 8 above,the Soviet Government might well take counter-action in regard to the ex-satelliteStates. Such counter-action might take the form of a Soviet declaration thatthe technical state of war between the U.S.S.R. and any or all of the ex-satelliteStates no longer existed, either with or without an invitation to other states at war with the countries concerned to do likewise. It would then be for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to decide in the light of the circumstances whether ornot to make a similar declaration themselves. The Soviet Government might also retaliate by making agreements with the ex-satellite States providing forthe retention of Soviet troops in the territory of such States. This, however,would be no worse than the present situation of fact, and, indeed, the onus wouldbe on the Soviet Government to show cause why they should keep large numbersof troops in the ex-satellite States. It is, of course, a cardinal point in our policy that Soviet troops should be withdrawn from the ex-satellite States where theynot only constitute a serious drain on the economic resources of the countries concerned, but also effectively prevent the establishment of free Governments ona democratic basis, and I have long felt that the only hope of securing this objectlies in the conclusion of peace treaties. We must therefore be quite sure thatthere is no hope of progress in that direction before putting the proposal outlined in paragraph 7 to the Soviet Government. But once we are sure, then I considerthat we need not be deterred by any fears of Soviet retaliation from proceeding with my suggestions in regard to Italy, which are, after all, a pis aller, based onthe hypothesis that no more satisfactory arrangement is in fact possible.11. Finally, I suggest that when the action outlined above has been taken,We should consider, in consultation with the United States, whether we couldnot raise the question of admitting Italy as one of the United Nations without waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Such action on our part would no doubt be obstructed by the Soviet Governments making Italy&apos;s candidatureconditional on acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment of similar treatment for the ex-satellite States. The Soviet Govern-ment might, alternatively, maintain that under the Potsdam Declaration, Italycan only be admitted to the United Nations after the conclusion Of a peace treaty.However, even if the Soviet Governments objections prevented the actualadmission of Italy to the United Nations, it might be to our advantage to havetaken the initiative in proposing it. In any case, I suggest that we should asfar as possible associate Italy with the work of the various economic bodies underthe aegis of the United Nations, particularly if it appears that her interests are involved or her co-operation will be of value to the United Nations.
