FHiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 306.4Jh December, 1945.CABINET.CABINET AND COMMITTEE PROCEDURE.Directive by the Prime Minister.IT was inevitable that for the first few months after we took office there should be very heavy pressure upon the policy-making organs of Government.I Much had to be done and done quickly; and Ministers had to meet together oftenJ and long to take essential decisions on major questions of policy and to give aI new direction to the work of the Departments over the whole field of the Govern-menfs programme.This phase is now passing.   We are moving from the stage of planning tothat of detailed preparation and execution.   We must therefore relax the straini which we have had to place on the Ministerial Committees of the Cabinet.I Ministers must now be.given more time for their duties in Parliament and inf their Departments.2.   I therefore ask my colleagues to observe the following principles in presenting business to the Cabinet and its Committees :  (a) The rule must now be strictly enforced that a memorandum intended forconsideration by the Cabinet or one of its Committees must be circulated twoclear days before the meeting at which it is to be considered. (This rule does[not, of course, apply to memoranda commenting on memoranda already circulated.)[I have asked the Secretary of the Cabinet to issue to all Departments a precisetforinulation of this rule and to see that it is strictly enforced. Exceptions canibe allowed only in cases of extreme urgency, with the sanction of the PrimeMinister or the Chairman of the Committee concerned.(b) Questions should not be submitted prematurely for decision by a meetingof Ministers.The business of the Cabinet and its Committees consists, in the main, of (i) questions on which there is a conflict of interest between Departments,which has not been resolved;(ii) questions of major policy which affect a number of Departments orengage the collective responsibility of the Government.Questions falling under the first of these heads should not be referred to theCabinet or a Cabinet Committee until all possible means of resolving the conflict
have been exhausted, including personal correspondence or discussion betweenthe Ministers concerned. Matters failing under the second head should bethoroughly examined at the official level, if necessarily inter-departmentally, before they are referred to Ministers, so that the policy decisions required may be clearly defined. This applies particularly to proposals which involve expenditure, oraffect general financial or economic policy : these should always be discussed withthe Treasury and, if Treasury agreement has not been secured at the official level, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before they are submitted to theCabinet or to a Ministerial Committee.(c) Matters which fall wholly within the departmental responsibility of asingle Minister and do not engage the collective responsibility of the government need not be brought to Cabinet or a Committee at all.   A precise definition ofsuch matters cannot be given, and in borderline cases a Minister is well-advised   jito bring the matter to a Committee, where it will probably not take much timeto settle. The central machinery of Government would, however, becomecompletely clogged if we proceeded on the basis that no question of policy can bedecided otherwise than by the Cabinet or one of its Committees. 1(d) We should avoid as far as possible the dilatory process of referring aquestion from one Committee to another. The existing rule that the legislation committee dees not deal with questions of policy may, I think, give rise to delayon this account. I have therefore informed the Chairman of the legislation committee that he should in future regard the Committee as empowered to settleminor questions of policy which arise in discussion of Bills submitted to it for examination. Major questions will, of course, continue to be considered by theappropriate policy Committee or by the Cabinet itself.(e) Memoranda for the Cabinet or its Committees should be as brief and asclear as possible. The model memorandum explains at the outset what the problem is, indicates briefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise state-ment of the decision sought. Supporting data may often be relegated to an appendix. If authority is sought to make a statement or despatch a telegram, Ia draft may be attached. Time spent in making a memorandum short and clearwill be saved many times over in reading and in discussion.4. To my colleagues who are Chairmen of Committees I would add thefollowing : (a) Keep discussion to the point and do not hesitate to check irrelevance orrepetition.(6) In summing up discussion, or suggesting possible conclusions, avoidframing them in a way which will require further discussion by ministers, if that is not necessary. Sometimes when a policy decision has been taken there is a tendency for a Committee to regard itself as responsible for its detailed working out or the supervision of its execution. While that may sometimes be appropriate, it can usuallybe left to the Ministers departmentally concerned.C. E. A.10 Downing Street, S.W . 1,4th December, 1945.
