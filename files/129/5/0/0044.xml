THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.._-_- 180SECRET.CP. (45) 344.18th December, 1945. &quot;CABINET.BROADCASTING POLICY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1. At their meeting on Monday, the 17th December (CM. (45) 63rdConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet asked for a further opportunity of considering the report on broadcasting policy (CP. (45) 293).2. As my colleagues will remember, conclusions were reached at that meetingon two important questions, namely, the increase in the wireless receiving licence fee and the continuation of the European Service with the consequentialrearrangement of programmes in the Home Services. As a result of the discussionI take it that the Cabinet also agree :(a) that it is unnecessary to hold a public enquiry before the B.B.C.&apos;s Charteris renewed (Recommendation 1);(&amp;) that the B.B.C. should retain its monopoly of the right of originatingbroadcasts in this country and that its Charter should be renewedfor a further period of ten years from the 1st January,  1947(Recommendation 2).3. My colleagues will no doubt have points to raise on the remainingrecommendations of the report, but it may be of some assistance if I set out whatseem to me to be the most important of them.   These are : &apos;(]( The B.B.C. should be under obligation to broadcast an adequate and impartial daily account of the proceedings in both Houses ofParliament. (Recommendation 22.)(ii) The cost of all B.B.C. services should be borne out of a single Broad-casting Vote, and the cost of overseas broadcasting should be borneby the Exchequer independent of any licence fee revenue. (Recom-mendation 24.)(iii) An attempt should be made to eliminate commercial broadcastingdirected to this country from overseas.   (Recommendation 25.)4. I hope that the Cabinet will find it possible to conclude their considera-tion of the report before my departure for Canada.H.
