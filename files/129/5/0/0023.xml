The following table compares the cost of the proposals in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper (CP. (45)315) with that of theproposals in the White Paper.    The first two columns of figures cover Social Insurance and Assistance and industrial injury Insurance.    They exclude Family Allowances and theNational Health Servicese    The third column covers the sameservices as the first two but includes also the contribution of  .37 million a year which is to bo paid from social insurance funds towards the cost of the National health service.

The new proposals thus involve,  as compared with theWhite Paper proposals, extra expenditure of  76 million in1948, met &quot;by an increase of contributions ::f  101 millionoffset by a decrease of Exchequer charge of  25 million.But the Exchequer carries the while of the increasing costand the Exchequer charge rises by about  100 million overeach of the two decades from 1948,    Nor is 1968 by any moansthe peak.    An increase of  10 million each year for thenext twenty is a most formidable prospect for the Exchequer.

5.      In two respects, I dm not in agreement with the lord privy Seal&apos;s proposals on benefits.    First, the unlimitedduration of unemployment benefit is fraught with possibilities -of abuse sufficient to involve a real risk   rf bringingGovernment administration into disrepute.    I am anxious tosee that benefit is given to all those who are in theindustrial field and unable, through no fault  of their own,to obtain work.    But we must recognise that the long termunemployed include some who have made no adequate efforts to get work and others, particularly married women, who arenot really effectively in the industrial field.    I should be reluctant to see the abandonment of the automatic terminationof benefit after a generous period until we have a satisfactoryadministrative control of the eases of long term unemployment.Such control no one has yet been able to devise.    Theprinciple should be, I think, that any-man or woman, including any married women,  who had drawn benefit for a certain period should Be required,  as a condition of drawing further benefit,to change either his occupation or his district of residence,or both.    But I am told that this principle is difficultto apply in practice.4.      Second,  as regards old age pensions, I question thenecessity for conceding a pension of 263/- a week to a singlepensioner.    Pensioners are accustomed to regarding a pension for a married couple as made up of two equal pensions one foreach spouse.    Indeed I think that method of division isgenerally preferred,    I should stick to it now.    I agree tothe figure of 42s/- a week for the double pension but, on theview just expressed, the single pension should be fflLs/-.    Thiswould mean an initial saying to the scheme of  27 million a year.    It would save, in addition to this,  750,000 a yearout of the formidable annual Increase of  10 million a yearmentioned above.5*      Further I strongly dissent from the propose.! to pay apension of 10s/- a week at 35 (60 for women) where the pensioner, has not retired.    This violates the principle of retirement pensions and is in conflict with the frequentlydeclared policy of the LaBour Party.    It is of the utmost importance to induce workers to remain at work as long as theyare efficient producers and the Best way to secure this is togive higher pensions on retirement for those who postponeretirement.    I agree that the addition proposed in the beveridge report of Is/- a week (2s/- for man and wife) foreach year of postponement is inadequate^I am willing to givethe maximum of inducement which bhe savings on postponementjustify?  and I am advised that we pcnld make the inducement2s/6d single and 5s/-- double for each year.    I do not think we need give much weight to the present expectation of an unconditional pension at 65, in view of the very large netadvantages offered &apos;to contributions^Jay the new scheme is byand large markedly more advantageous to the contributor thanthe pr?eseno ens *

6.      The Lord Privy Seal proposes that the contribution ofthe workers should be brought down from 5s/2d a week to4s/6d a week for a man in Glass I and to appropriate figuresfor other, classes.    Before considering this proposal we must first settle what the benefits are to be.    The limitation on the duration of unemployment benefit to thirty weeks andthe reduction of pensions for a single person from 26s/- to21s/- would each save about 7d a week on the total contribution (half on the worker, half on the employer).If,, therefore, these two amendments were made,  the workers1&apos;contribution would be reduced to 4/7.,   In any case, if the contribution is thought to be too high,  we must consider some appropriate alteration in the basis on which the contribution is built up.    I cannot contemplate merely an arbitrary transfer of so many pence a week from the workerto the taxpayer.    This would soon lead to pressure for a bigger arbitrary transfer.    The practical question is howheavy a burden can be imposed, without running grave futurerisks, on the taxpayer and on the contributor.IV,7o      It has been clear from the time of the Be ve ridge Reportthat o. comprehensive scheme of Social Insurance would involvemajor financial considerations both at   -nee and, in increasingdegree, in the future.   Now we have reached the decisionstage of incorporating proposals in a Bill.8a      Social Insurance on generous lines involves a substantialtransfer of purchasing power from producers to non-producers.    And this is in addition to many other largetransfers of a similar character already being madec    Whetherthe transfers involved will be accepted by the -producers,whether in the form of contributions or taxation,  dependspartly on the vplume of production   ait of which the transfershave to be made and partly on the amount of the transfer,The essential c vndition for a successful carrying of all theseburdens is a high level of production i.e. full employmentof the maximum number of&apos; potential workers oath a high standard of pr xluctivit,ye9.-&apos;    The present proposals hove, however, the special featurethat owing to the growth In the numbers of the population, over65 and (after a short term)  the diminution in the numbersbetween 16 and 65,  the burden will become significantly heavieras the years go on.    This is,  as I see it,  a real danger point.The measures which may have to be talc en from time to timecannot be settled now.    But while wo cannot foretell thefuture, we must iry not to prejudice it.    One particularmeasure which may help a great deal will probably beencouragement of workers to remain on the active list longer than they do   now.-   It is for that reason that I should-3-

especially deplore the under lining in the new schemeof the age of 65 as an age for pension and inparticular the institution, alongside retirement pensions at the age of retirement,  of a pension at65 irrespective of retirement.      Pensions should begiven at retirement,     -The future can settle whenretirement is to be.H.D,Treasury Chambers, S.if. 1..5TH DECEMBER,  1915.
