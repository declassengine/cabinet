THIS DOCPMENTISi^HE^PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1945. *SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 329.8th December, 1945..   CABINET.BILL FOR THE NATIONALISATION OF COALMINING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by.the Minister of Fuel and Power.1. AT the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on the 2nd October(L.P. (45) 35th Meeting, Minute 2) the Committee had before them a memo-randum (L.P. (45) 179) setting out the main features which I proposed to embodyin the Bill for the Nationalisation of the Coalmining Industry, and theyauthorised me to proceed with the preparation of a draft Bill. In my memorandum I drew attention to the complexity of the Bill which results fromthe fact that it is concerned with the transfer of particular assets, interests,liabilities and benefits appertaining to undertakings engaged in a wide variety of activities besides coalmining. This has meant that the conveyancing aspectsof the Bill are of a complicated character. The compensation provisions arecorrespondingly difficult.2. At the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on the 23rd November(L.P. (45) 44th Meeting. Minute 5) the Committee had before them a further memorandum (L.P. (45) 238) covering a draft of the Bill and asking for authorityto submit it to the consideration of the Cabinet and the Legislation Committee.It was decided, however, that the Lord President should convene a small committee of Ministers to examine a revised draft and report direct to theCabinet with a view to the consideration of the Bill by the Cabinet and theLegislation Committee being completed not later than the week ending Saturday,the 15th December.3. A meeting of Ministers accordingly took place on the 6th December, whencertain matters relating to the Bill were discussed, and it was agreed that thesame draft should be circulated, as soon as possible, to the Cabinet with an indication of the respects in which the next print of the Bill would be alteredfrom the draft then available. The draft now circulated is accordingly in theform in which it was considered by the meeting of Ministers.4. Clause 1 of the Bill establishes the National Coal Board and sets out itsprimary duties in subsection (1). These are the working of the coal mines andthe making available of coal in such quantities and at such prices as may seem tothe Board best calculated to further the public interest. The functions and powersof the Board are set-out in sub-clauses (2) and (3). They are drawn widelybecause it appears desirable, and will in general prove necessary, that the board should be permitted to do anything which a privately owned colliery undertakingmight find it requisite, advantageous or convenient to do, including, in particular,the treatment of coal and coal products, the production and sale of goods orutilities which could advantageously be so dealt with by the Board, and theprovision of facilities for training, education and research. In performing their functions the Board are to act (sub-clause (4)) in such manner ar- they think bestfor furthering the safety, health and welfare of the workers they employ, andfor securing that the industry will pay its way.5. Clause 2 gives the constitution of the Board, which is to consist of a chairman, Deputy Chairman and seven other members appointed by the minister from among persons with appropriate qualifications set out in sub-clause (3). Itis intended to add to this clause a provision to make it clear that members of the commons House of Parliament will not be eligible for appointment to the Board.[31026]
Salaries and allowances of members of the Board are to be fixed by the minister with the approval of the Treasury (sub-clause 5) and their appointment, tenure of office, &amp;e, will be laid down in regulations (sub-clause 6). I ought perhaps atthis point to call attention to the fact that there are some 20 clauses in the bill which confer regulation-making powers, on matters which, on past precedents,would have been covered by detailed provisions in the Bill. This will be attackedas representing a new departure in legislation of this kind.6. Clause 3 empowers the Minister to give the Board general directions asto the exercise and performance of their functions in relation to matters appearing to the Minister to affect the national interest. It is considered that this willenable directions to be given on such questions as the co-ordination of theindustry&apos;s investment programme with that of the country generally, the expan-sion of the export trade, and the alleviation of social dislocations which mightbe caused by the closure of pits.7. Clause 4 requires the Minister to establish two Consumers&apos; Councils,covering industrial and domestic supplies respectively, to deal with matters which appear to them to require consideration, and to notify their conclusions to theMinister where action appears to them to be requisite.8. Clauses 5 and 8, and the First Schedule, which should be read inconjunction therewith, deal with the transfer of assets to the Board. Part Iof the Schedule consists of assets which are to be automatically transferred tothe Board, and it includes, speaking broadly, the assets essential for coalmining,together with ancillary assets such as coke ovens (not forming part of an under-taking which owns iron and steel works) manufactured fuel plants, power stations, &amp;c, which are owned by colliery concerns and are physically or financiallyclosely associated with coalmining. Part II specifies assets to be transferredat the option of the Board or on the requirement of the owners. It includes assetsless closely connected with coalmining, such as brick works, wharves, harbours,Ac, housing and farming property, and one or two other classes of assets whichthe Board might find it advantageous to take over, or which cannot in fairnessbe left on the hands of colliery companies denuded of their principal activities.Part III is concerned with assets to be transferred at the option of the Board,or of the owners, subject to arbitration if either side objects to the option exer-cised by the other. It covers assets such as certain manufactured fuel plants,private railways. &amp;c, not owned by concerns but by persons engaged in activities which are particularly connected with the industry and which, if not transferred,might prejudice the Board or the present owners. Part IV covers all other assetsowned by colliery concerns not covered by Parts I-III, but excludes from transferthings used wholly or mainly for purposes of iron and steel works.9. Clause 6 provides for the transfer of rights and liabilities under existing contracts, and should be read in conjunction with the detailed classificationthereof set out in the Second Schedule. The Clause includes an escape provision to enable the Board to avoid contracts of personal service entered into since the1st August, 1945, and contracts entered into with unreasonable want of prudenceby the previous owners.10. The above-mentioned Clauses, with the addition of Clause 9 (which relates to compensation), and the Financial Provisions (Clauses 17-23) constitute the essential framework of the Bill. The remaining Clauses are of less import-ance. and are of a general or miscellaneous character.11. Clauses 9 to 16 deal with the payment and allocation of compensation,the determination and valuation of claims, and with the compensation machinery to be established. These provisions are of a somewhat complicated character, butare in broad accord with the procedure which was followed when the ownership of the minerals was transferred to the Coal Commission by the Coal Act, 1938.Attention is drawn to Clause 10, which is inserted in order to implement anundertaking which I gave to the Mining Association that money expended on capital development in anticipation of nationalisation would be reimbursed tocolliery undertakings.12. Clauses 17 to 23 are the draft financial provisions. It will be noted thatthe heading to those Clauses indicates that they are to be rewritten. I explained the more important of the additions and alterations to be made in these Clausesto the Meeting of Ministers, and secured their agreement to the proposals, andthe Treasury and my Ministry are in consultation upon the details. these clauses will accordingly appear in a somewhat altered form in the Bill presented
to Parliament. It will be noted that by Clause 17 compensation is generally -4obe made in Government stock, though that will not exclude compensation in cashin respect of the capital expenditure described in Clause 10 mentioned above, andin respect of stores transferred. Provision will be made for two annual revenuepayments to the existing owners, equivalent to half the profits earned during a previous period. This payment will be in substitution for the interest payments which would otherwise have to be made between the date on which the assets werevested and the date on which valuation was completed and final compensationpaid. It is necessary because of the delay which must inevitably occur beforevaluation and the determination of the compensation due to individual under-takings are completed. In addition the Bill will contain provision under which,for the purpose of paying off shareholders, equitable arrangements must be madeto ensure that holders of particular classes of shares will not be differentiallyaffected by reason of the fact that liquidation of the company may be necessitatedas a result of nationalisation.13. The broad intention of Clauses 18 to 20 is to empower the Board to borrow only from the Treasury, except for temporary purposes; to enable theTreasury to lend to the Board from the Consolidated Fund up to a maximum of  150 million, and to raise money for the purpose; to impose obligations uponthe Board to provide for the service of the stock issued, or cash paid, by way ofcompensation, and of money lent by the Treasury; and to require the Board tomake such payments for the redemption of the compensation and loans as theTreasury may direct. Furthermore, the Minister is to be obliged to lay beforethe House of Commons a statement of any payments due wdiich have not been paid,and the Board are under obligation to apply any surplus revenue in a financialyear in such manner as the Minister may direct. While these provisions imposesomewhat stringent obligations upon the Board. I do not think they will proveunduly restrictive, and it will, of course, be necessary, if an effective nationalinvestment policy is to&apos;be carried through, to ensure that a considerable measureof control shall be exercisable over the financial transactions of the Board.Clauses 21 to 23 do not appear to call for any particular comment.14. Clauses 24 to 34 are of a miscellaneous character, few of which braiseissues of any great moment. Clause 25, however, gives power to make regulations to enable the Board to pay pensions to former employees of the Board and toassume responsibility for contractual or customary obligations incurred in respectof persons previously employed by colliery concerns and certain other bodies.I have not provided for compensation for the employees of colliery undertakings,and bodies connected with the industry who prove to be redundant, or whosestatus is detrimentally affected. As there is a considerable body of precedentsfrom earlier enactments providing for compensation in such circumstances. Ianticipate strong opposition. None the less, having regard to the circumstancesof the coalmining industry, I feel that compensation should not be payable.15. Clause 29 effects certain alterations in the constitution of the Miners&quot;Welfare Commission, and provides for persons holding office at the commence-ment of the Act to vacate office. It also enables the Minister to give directions to the Commission. These provisions are made to remove the anomalous situationwhich would otherwise exist as between the status of the Commission on the onehand, and the Board on the other.16. Clause 26 reproduces the relevant provisions of the Public AuthoritiesProtection Act, 1893, to make it clear that the officers and servants of the board shall be given the benefit of the protection that Act provides to such persons whenemployed by a public authority.17. Clauses 35 to 41 are &quot; General &quot; provisions which raise no questionsof new policy. It may be appropriate, however, to draw attention to Clause 36which sets out a number of provisions for which the regulations referred to inother Clauses of the Act may provide in addition to the provisions specified inthose Sections. Regulations are to be laid before Parliament as soon as theyare made and are subject to annulment by a negative resolution of either Housewithin 40 days.E.
