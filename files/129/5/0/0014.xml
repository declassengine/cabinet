THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT^ &apos;     ^7Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 314.29th November, 1945.38CABINET.LABOUR CONTROLS.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Labour and National Service.AT their meeting on the 20th November (CM. (45) 54th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet invited us to review the proposals put forward in cp. (45) 288 for relaxation of the labour controls, and to submit revised proposalsfor the Cabinet&apos;s consideration.We have made a careful review of the position and have considered the points raised in the Cabinet5s discussion. As a result we are convinced that, while stepsmust be taken to preserve the existing labour force in our essential industries, itis in the national interest to relax very substantially the controls regarding thedirection and engagement of labour.2. At present men aged 18 to 30 are being called up to the Armed Forces;women are not being called up. So long as men above the age of 18 are being called up it seems to us that we must continue the control of male civilian labourup to the same age-otherwise very strong feeling is likely to be aroused in theForces. The continuance of labour controls pari passu with military call-up islogical and defensible and will, we believe, be accepted by the country.3. In coming to our conclusions we have taken into account the fact that,apart from the Essential Work Orders, the existing controls are not being and cannot be enforced and that the law is being brought into disrepute. We havealso taken into account the fact that at the present time labour is becoming available for home civilian and export trade at a rate of something like \ million a month, and that by the end of the year our civilian industries and servicestaken as a.whole will have been more than half restored to their 1939 level. Theremaining gap will be largely filled well before the middle of 1946. It is true thatthere are a limited number of industries and services in which recruitment isdifficult. This is mainly because improvements either in wages and conditionsof employment or in physical conditions are urgently needed. So long as employerscan look to the Government to direct men and women to these industries and services, they will not take steps to effect the necessary improvements without which it will be impossible to increase their labour force, even with the rigoroususe of the power of direction. If controls were relaxed, the employers in these industries would have to take effective measures to improve conditions for theirown protection.4.   We accordingly make the following recommendations : Preservation of &apos;existing Labour Force.(1) The Essential Work Orders should be continued for those industries inwhich it is essential to maintain or increase the existing labour force;this should include the Civil Service Control of Employment Order.(2) In those industries in which man-power considerations no longer makeit necessary to continue the Essential Work Order, the industries should be informed that it is proposed to remove them from the Orderon a given date in the near future, thus giving them an opportunityto negotiate agreements embodying some of the features of the 0&apos;rdersuch as the guaranteed week.[30972]
Direction and Engagement of Labour.(3) Except for the purpose of enforcing the Essential Work Orders and ensuring that men and women released from the Forces out of turn in class B enter the employment for which they were released, the useof the powTer of direction except in the special case of housing (seerecommendation 6) should be limited to men up to age 30; and the requirement under the Control of Engagement Order that labour should be engaged only through an Employment Exchange or otherapproved agency should apply only to men up to age 30; the useof the power of direction and control of engagement should no longerapply to women.(4) When the age of call up is lowered, say to 25, the labour controls shouldbe similarly lowered.(5) The power of direction in respect of men up to age 30 should be used only to meet the special needs of housing and of those industries and products designated for the purpose of obtaining First Preference for labour.(6) As a special exception, the power of direction in respect of men overthe age of 30 should be retained for the limited purpose of requiringmen already in the building industry to go on to housing work, i.e.,for redistributing the labour force in the industry.The building industry with its rapid turnover of labour from onejob to another presents a special problem; it is particularly important to be able to send labour already in the industry to particular jobsfor the housing programme.- (7) These limited controls should be strictly enforced and there should be no hesitation to institute proceedings against persons breaking the law.This should apply particularly to employers who break the Control of engagement Order.Date of Operation.(8) The changes outlined above should come into operation on Monday, the10th December, following an announcement to be made in parliament on Thursday, the 6th December.E. B.G. A. I.29th November, 1945.
