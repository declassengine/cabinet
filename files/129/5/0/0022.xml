EIBADCIAE AND ECONOMIC NBGQTIATIONS WITH U.-S.A.Note By the treasury.      The latest position about announcing the results both on thefinancial and on other sides as shown in the latest telegrams from Washington appears to be that the Americans are thinking of a time-table on the following lines:-Day 1    Publication &quot;by the U. S.  Government of their proposals for setting up an International Trade Organisation.Day 2    Issue of a joint communique  summing up the results of thefinancial negotiations,  sayint that the U..S.  and the U.K.are agreed on launching the I.T.0.  proposals and alsosumming up on minor matters such as Lend-Lease settlement,U.S.  surpluses in the U.X.  etc.  together with statement in Parliament by the President of the Board of Tradewelcoming I. T.0.  proposals and explaining tariff andpreference provisions.2.      We should propose to amplify and amend this programme asfollowsBay I    (a) Publication By the U.S.  Government of proposals foran I.T.O.(B) Statement after Questions, By the President of theBoard of Trade dealing with I.T.O.  proposals.(c) Re pub 1 i o a t i on by H. M. G.   of I.T.O.  proposals in a white Paper.Day 2    (a) Issue of joint communique in Washington as set out&apos;above, which would be simultaneously(b) Made as a statement to the House of Commons.(c) Issue of White Papers containing(i) Financial Agreement&apos;(ii) Any other agreements, e.g.   on Bend-Lease wind-up:(iii) (Subject to clearance with Washington) figures onU. K.  position as put in. to ,,rnericans.Bay 3    (a) First Reading of Bretton Woods Bill(b) Appearance on Order Paper of Motion about financial agreement,  I. T.0. proposals,  and Bretton Woods Bill.3.      The President of the Board of Trade is anxious to make his statement as soon as the I.T.0.  proposals are published, since otherwise the Opposition press etc. will have a free run to attack the preference solution.

. Authority is required -(i) To telegraph to Washington in the sense ofparagraph 2 above.(ii) To obtain final approval of the statement bythe President of the &quot;oard of Trade.      Thiswas circulated as Annex A to C. P.(h5)297 andhas &quot;been concurred in by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, but no formalCabinet decision on it was recorded.This approval is sought in order that thestatement can be telegraphed to Dominions inaccordance with our undertaking to do so.1st D e c o mb e r,  1 9h 5
