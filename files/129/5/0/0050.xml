THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP ^L1!&quot;? JllTA*NIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 350.28th December, 1945.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF GERMAN MERCHANT FLEET.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.THE Tripartite Commission, in which we participated with the Soviet and united States Governments&apos;, in accordance with the Potsdam Protocol on german merchant shipping, has now made its Report to the three Governments. I annexa copy of the Report and a commentary thereon.2.   The substance of the Potsdam Protocol was (i) The German merchant fleet was to be divided equally between SovietRussia, United States and the United Kingdom.(ii) The smaller maritime Allies were to be provided for out of the shares of the United States and the United Kingdom, except that SovietRussia was to provide for Poland.3. Within the framework laid down for them by the Potsdam Protocol theBritish representatives have achieved a satisfactory allocation for the UnitedKingdom. Negotiations have been tedious and difficult and I am satisfied thatit would be useless and unwise for us to attempt to modify this part of the Corn-mission&apos;s work.4. As explained in paragraph 5 of the attached commentary, there arecertain of the other recommendations of the Commission which we cannot accept.These concern primarily the details of delivery of the ships. The majority of theships surrendered by the Germans fell into our hands and those that could be madeready in the time available have been put into service. This was permissible underthe Potsdam Protocol. It is impracticable to collect all these ships which pertainto be Soviet share and hand them over forthwith, as the Soviet Government appearto expect. There are also formalities to be gone through since we had to put the ships through the Prize Court in order to get them into service. We shallhave to reserve our position in these matters in accepting the Report, though weshould make it clear that we intend to hand over with the utmost despatch theships now in our service or custody which are allotted to the other parties.Until the allocation to the smaller Allies has been worked out with the UnitedStates, these questions of delivery primarily concern the ships for the Sovietshare which are in our hands. The Soviet Government will be in some difficultyin taking over the ships. We can make some available to them very quickly and press ahead with the delivery of others as soon as practicable, but they will attach importance to no new service being undertaken meanwhile, and this we shallhave to agree.5. The Commission failed to agree on several points, of which the only oneof immediate importance is whether compensation should be paid by the user ofvessels for the period prior to delivery under the agreed division if they areallotted to one of the other Governments. Any liability under this head wouldbe primarily ours, since the majority of the ships have been in our servico orcustody. My representatives have hitherto refused to accept any liability underthis head and I propose to continue to support them in this attitude. The PotsdamProtocol does not impose any such liability. We have spent large sums in gettingthese German ships into service for the benefit of the common war effort, andthere is no just ground on which we can be required to make payment to theSoviet Government for German ships which are now to be delivered to them.I do not propose that our ratification of the division of ships proposed by the tripartite Commission should be held up, nor would I propose to delay delivery of ships due to the Russians on this account, but I continue to refuse to accept any liability for payment for the use of these ships in the past.[31081] b
6. I recommend that we should inform the other two Governments forthwiththat we accept the division of ships proposed by the Tripartite Commission, withthe reservation of the points of detail referred to in paragraph 4 above. Theterms of the communication and of the reservation should be agreed by my Depart-ment with the Foreign Office and the Admiralty.7. I suggest that, if we accept the division quickly and begin the deliveriesforthwith to the Soviet Government, we shall reduce the prospects of argumentupon formalities and put ourselves in a better position to resist inequitableproposals as to liability for the use we have so far had of these ships.A. B.Ministry of War Transport, W. 1,28th December, 1945.ANNEX 1.Comment by Minister of War Transport on the Report of the TripartiteMerchant Marine Commission.1.   The total tonnage to be divided between the three Powers was establishedby the Commission to be 1,189,600 gross registered tons or 1,542,900 deadweightI, S21 tons, consisting qfjiggvessels valued ajffiCgflT?rdC,000 at 1938 prices.  The divisionjZZjlias been ihadd on the&quot;l5asis of values and the allocation may be summarisednroj as[ -20/ S^r^eotpJ as followsCountry. i No.        G.R.T.      D.W.T. Value.United Kingdom .!UZ ?B53% 435,800 582,800 6,843,000United States ... 1611 367,400 463,100 6,833,000U.S.S.R.     ...      ...      178       386,400      497,000     ^^9S0The average age of the larger ships in the British share is 15^ years amPin theAmerican and the Russian 17^ years. The average age of the smaller ships in the British share is 20^ years, while that of the Russians and Americans, whohave taken more of these, is       and 18^ respectively.2. In general the division into the three shares is acceptable. The british share contains some of the better class vessels, particularly passenger ships andone whale factory, and in consequence we have had to accept a relatively high proportion of old and damaged vessels. The United States share has been influenced by their acceptance of the large passenger ship Europa. The U.S.S.R.share contains a high proportion of ships which have already been brought tothe United Kingdom and placed in service, but this was unavoidable.3. The British and United States shares have still to bear a contribution for certain minor maritime Allies. In accordance with a decision of the paris conference on Reparations, this matter is to be dealt with by the Inter-AlliedReparation Authority. The ships in the two shares are to be in proportion to the gross losses of the countries which have lost shipping redivided by Germanaction.4. The needs of the German peace-time economy for coastal shipping are provided for by the reservation from the division by the Tripartite Commissionof 200,000 deadweight tons. This figure was agreed at the Control Council asthe maximum required for this purpose and was a compromise between theUnited Kingdom figure, supported by the French and United States representa-tives, of 305,000 tons and the U.S.S.R. figure of 60,000 tons. It is considered that200,000 deadweight tons, which is approximately the amount of German tonnage in use on the German coast at the present time, may just suffice for the needs ofthe German economy.5. There are certain features of the Report which cannot be accepted without reservation : (a) The lists contain some ships which have been claimed by Allied and neutral Governments, as not being German.(b) Dates for commencement and completion of delivery are recommendedwhich are quite impracticable. The recommendations assume that the British Government can overrule the procedure of the prize court.
(c) Recommendations regarding the very considerable sums involved in the repair of ships which have been put into service prior to delivery,while just in principle, involve severe accounting difficulties.(d) The recommendation regarding non-German ships mentioned in theReport is not consistent with our obligations under the Agreementswe have made with Allied Governments as to the return of their ships found in German hands.(e) The United Kingdom is asked to accept liability for a number of shipssunk in the course of disposing of German poison gas, following theinstructions of S.H A.E.F. The liability for these ships as betweenthe British and United States Governments must be further discussed.6.   The Commission failed to agree on four matters, namely : (i) the disposal of the German fishing fleet;(ii) the disposal of the German port facilities;(iii) the disposal of the German inland water transport;(iv) compensation for the use of vessels prior to delivery.7. The British representatives, supported by the Americans, considered thatthe first three of these items should be dealt with in the same way as other capital goods included in reparations. The U.S.S.R. share would thus be included inthe percentage of goods from the Western zone to which she is entitled underthe Potsdam decision (25 per cent.) and for which she has to pay. The Russianproposal that these items should be distributed by the Tripartite commission would mean that the U.S.S.R. would obtain free deliveries of these furthermaterials. Further, the Russian view was that under the Potsdam Protocol allthese ships were for division between the three Powers, whereas the british representatives maintained that it was necessary to reserve a minimum forthe needs of the German peace-time economy.8. As regards item (iv). Since we have been the major user of these ships,it is we. who stand to lose most if the other Allies force us to agree to pay for theuse of ships while in our service before delivery. During the course of the summermy representatives reached an informal and oral agreement with the war shipping Administration that such payments should not be made.ANNEX 2.Report of the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission recommending theAllocation of Merchant Vessels of the German Merchant Marine tothe&apos; Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, theGovernment of the United Kingdom, and the Government of the UnitedStates of America.Index.Section A. Report of the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission.Section B. Recommendations of the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission.Section C. Appendices (not reproduced in this copy).There are attached to the original Report (1) Lists of the allocation of the vessels in detail to the three shares;(2) An exchange of letters establishing the amount of tonnage to be reservedfor the German peace-time economy together with lists of the ships;(3) Lists of German ships sunk in German and neighbouring waters amountingto about 400,000 G.R.T.;(4) Lists of Allied and Neutral vessels recovered in Germany, of which theCommission was aware; and(5) The Minutes of the Meetings of the Plenary Sessions of the Commission.Section &quot;A.&quot; Report of the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission.1.   The Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the UnitedKingdom, and the United States of America agreed, at the Conference held at berlin between the 17th July and the 2nd August, 1945, that &apos;&apos; The German[31081] b 2
merchant marine, surrendered to the three Powers and wherever located, shallbe divided equally among the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, and the UnitedStates.&quot; For this purpose the three Governments agreed to &quot; Constitute a tripartite Merchant Marine Commission comprising two representatives for each government, accompanied by the requisite staff, to submit agreed recommenda-tions to the three Governments for the allocation of specific German merchantmarine ships and to handle other detailed matters arising out of the agreementbetween the three Governments regarding the German merchant ships.&quot;2. As authorised by the above agreements, a Tripartite Merchant MarineCommission, comprising two representatives of each Government, was established.The representatives were : &apos;Admiral G. I. Levchenko, U.S.S.R.Mr. A. A. Affanasiev, N.K.M.F., U.S.S.R.Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey J. A. Miles, K.C.B., United Kingdom.Sir Andrew Common, M.W.T., United Kingdom.Vice-Admiral R. L. Ghormley, U.S.N., United States.Mr. Thomas F. Dunn, W.S.A., United States.3. The Commission met in the City of Berlin, at the Headquarters of theAllied Control Authority, from the 1st September to the 7th December, 1945.4. A special committee was established for deciding all practical matters connected with the division of the German merchant marine and for preparingrecommendations for the distribution of the vessels between the three Powers.In addition, a Technical sub-committee was formed to inventory the vesselscomprising the German merchant marine and to compile the lists of these vessels,as well as a Sub-Committee for their valuation according to the method adopted.5. The representative of each of the three Governments assumed theresponsibility for submitting lists of all German ships known to them, and theselists were corrected by the Technical sub-committee as further information came to light. On the basis of these lists the Commission compiled the first basic lists of the German merchant ships available, divided in four categories, viz. :A Passenger Liners, B Cargo Liners, C Tankers and Special ships, D DryCargo vessels.Each category of vessels was sub-divided in two groups : (1) Large vessels Passenger ships over 1,600 GRT and Cargo ships over2,300 DWT.(2) Small vessels Passenger and cargo ships under above-mentioned tonnage.Vessels under 1,600 GRT or 2,300 DWT were listed separately as it wasconsidered that the requirements of the Allied Control Council could be met outof this tonnage.6. The basis adopted for division was a valuation of the tonnage at 1938building prices.The Committee worked out the values, taking into account type, size, speed and age of the vessels, also the type of machinery.The method adopted was, of necessity, somewhat arbitrary, but it provided a practical means of assessing the relative values of the vessels to be distributed.Passenger vessels were valued separately. The values were assessed before it was known to which Power the vessel would be allocated.7. On completion of the first Basic lists on the 18th September, 1945,inspection parties, comprising representatives of the U.S.S.R., United Kingdom,and the United States, were sent to the ports in all zones of Germany, and to theUnited Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Holland. Instructions weregiven to the representatives of the three Powers to inspect the German merchantvessels in the United States ports.The inspection parties inspected the German merchant vessels which lay inthe ports at the time of inspection. Some of the vessels mentioned in the firstBasic list were not inspected as they were at sea. The inspection parties founda number of vessels not mentioned in the first Basic Lists.Many vessels of small tonnage (Coastal ships) were not inspected as time didnot allow of this.According to the condition of the vessels, their machinery and cargo gearas recorded in the inspection reports, the values were adjusted and the final agreedlists were compiled.
8. The Commission discussed the question of the vessels, which, according to&quot;the order of Allied Supreme Commander, were sunk with Chemical warfareammunition. It was agreed that nine vessels, which were already sunk at the timeof the discussion, were to be excluded from the lists of the German merchantmarine to be divided and to be included in the List of Sunken ships with anotation to this effect. It was agreed to leave the other six vessels, the loading ofwhich with Chemical warfare ammunition had begun, in the list of the german merchant marine to be divided and to include them in the share of the UnitedKingdom.9. The Commission at its first meeting addressed a letter to the allied control Council for Germany asking for information about the tonnage necessaryto the needs of the German peace economy.On the 21st November, 1945, the reply of the Allied Control Council wasreceived, requesting the reservation for the needs of the German peace economy of 175,000 tons carrying capacity of the German merchant marine (see appendix 3).In order to meet this request the Commission reserved 200.000 tons DWT,i.e., 175,000 tons carrying capacity (see appendix 4); the Commission then worked out its recommendations for the division of the German merchant marine betweenthe three Powers (see appendix 1).10. The Commission discussed the following questions, arising out of thedecision of the Berlin Conference regarding the German merchant marine:  (a) Sunken vessels.(6) Merchant vessels that were owned by the Allies and Neutrals and seizedby the Germans.(c) Repair and re-conversion of the vessels to be divided.(d) Supply of the ships to be divided, with spare parts, stores, fuel and food.(e) Provision of the vessels to be divided with the necessary shipping andtechnical documents.(/) Delivery of vessels divided between the three Powers.(g) German merchant ships under construction in Sweden.(Ji) German merchant ships which may be found in the future.(i) German Sea Fishing Fleet.(j) German port facilities and dredging fleet.(k) Inland Water Transport.(Z) Compensation for use of vessels prior to delivery.Section   &quot; B.&quot; Recommendation  of  the   Tripartite  Merchant  MarineCommission for the Division of the German Merchant Marine.The Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission agrees and recommends to thethree Governments that 1. The German merchant marine surrendered to the three Powers be dividedequally among the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, and the United States,according to the attached list (see appendix 1).2. In conformity with the decision of the Allied Control Council (seeappendix 3) 175,000 tons carrying capacity, i.e., 200,000 DWT, of the german merchant marine be reserved for German peace economy in accordance with theattached list (see appendix 4).3. All the German merchant vessels sunk within five miles of the coast ofGermany (see appendix 5) be destroyed before the end of 1946.Each of the three Powers, represented on the Commission, shall report to the others when this has been done.In the case of the few vessels mentioned in appendix 5, sunk in the coastalzones of countries other than Germany, a formal request for their destructionshall be sent to the Sovereign Powers concerned.4. Vessels not of German nationality (see appendix 6) be placed in the custody of the Allied Control Council for Germany, pending return to theirowners on proof of title.5. The Commission discussed the question of the German merchant vesselsthat were in construction in the Swedish shipyards at the time of capitulation ofGermany.As the information about this question is insufficient, the matter be taken upthrough the normal diplomatic channels.
6. As regards German merchant ships which are subject to the BerlinAgreement and which may subsequently be found when the agreement about the division of the German merchant marine is in force, independently of the flagunder which these ships may be, the three Governments take in such cases all appropriate measures through the normal diplomatic channels to secure animmediate delivery of these ships to the Allied Control Council for Germany, andthe principles of the agreement for the division of the German merchant marinebe applied to these ships.7. The repair of damage caused by War or Marine Risks during use,running repairs effected for the benefit of the user, and running repairs effectedwhile in use before delivery, be for the account of the user and not be charged tothe recipient Power.Special fittings, as in the case of troopers, be for the account of the user.Passenger accommodations fitted for troop carrying have to be re-converted totheir previous state at the expense of the country which made the fitting.Capital restoration repairs and repairs to damage caused by war or marinecasualties suffered by vessels prior to the Surrender of Germany, also improve-ments to crew accommodation be paid for by the Government to which the vessel isallocated to the Government in whose country or zone the repair has been orwill be effected. Where repairs have been or will be effected in Germany the costbe borne by Germany and charged against the Reparations&apos; account of the recipient Power.The custodian Power shall facilitate the repair of a vessel in Germanyallocated to the other Powers to the extent of making her seaworthy to sail orbe towed before German repair facilities are radically reduced in accordancewith the Allied Policy agreed at Berlin.In the United Kingdom repair facilities will also be granted but no special priority can be given.8. All spare parts, stores, furniture and equipment on board be handedover at the time of transfer to the recipient Power and anything removed fromthe vessel by the custodian Power or its agents be returned.9. All available documents on board or in the possession of the custodianpower or its agents be handed over at the time of delivery. Plans known to beavailable in the builders&apos; yards be handed over also.10. On transfer the custodian Power shall certify to the recipient power the authority under which delivery is made.11. The physical delivery of the vessels be stated immediately on ratification of the report and recommendations of the Commission, and it is hoped thatdelivery can be begun by the 20th December, 1945. Between the signing of thereport and ratification information on locations of ships to be transferred besupplied to the recipient Powers and vessels be concentrated in nominated agreedports. Representatives of each of the three Powers in the ports of delivery be instructed to give every possible assistance to the recipient Power.Every effort be made to complete the delivery of the ships by the20th January, 1946.All other matters relative to the delivery of German merchant vessels lying-in ports of Powers represented on the Commission or of zones occupied by thembe dealt with bi-laterally between the Sovereign Nations concerned, in other portsthey be arranged direct between the recipient Power and the country concerned.12. If any German vessels, allocated under the division lists to one of thethree Powers be lost or damaged before the physical delivery to the said Power,while in service by another Power, this last Power is under the obligation to give to the Power to which the vessel was to be delivered a vessel of similar type fromits own list or to repair the damaged vessel at its expense.13. As the Commission failed to reach agreement on the disposal of theGerman fishing fleet, dredger fleet, port facilities, Inland water transport and compensation for use of vessels prior to delivery, it was agreed to recommend tothe three Governments to decide these questions separately without connectingthem with the division of the German merchant marine.14. The Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission be dissolved on the dateof the ratification of this report and recommendations.After the dissolution of the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission, the senior Naval Officers in Germany, representing each of the three Powers, assisted
by the Representatives of Narkommerflot, the British Ministry of War Transport,and the United States War Shipping Administration, where necessary, beauthorised to handle any questions which may subsequently arise out of theagreement between the three Governments regarding the German merchantmarine.15.
