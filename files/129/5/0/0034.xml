THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.    3 8CP. (45) 334.8th December, 1945.CABINET.RELEASE OF DOCTORS FROM THE ROYAL NAVY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I submit the following memorandum in order that my colleagues may know the measures I have taken to endeavour to reach the target set for me in thedecision of the Cabinet on the 8th November (CM. (45) 51st Conclusions, Minute 5)and the consequences of that decision.Release Measures.2. The annex to this memorandum shows the statistical position. I haveto release some 1,150 doctors between the 1st November and the 31st December.At the beginning of that period the approximate number of doctors borne inappointments at home and in Home Waters was 1,050. The bulk of the remainder(to the extent of over 900) were in the Far East. It would be manifestly impossiblefor the Admiralty to effect the release of 1,150 by the 31st December.3. In my opinion it is essential that the Admiralty should effect theadditional doctor releases as nearly as possible in accord with the Release Scheme.A considerable proportion of the doctors to be released will have to come home from abroad and except where under the new austerity standard which theCabinet decision calls for they can be sent home without relief, they will not beable to reach England for dispersal for some weeks.4.   I have given instructions to (a) Speed up Class A releases to the level (Age and Service Group 40)calculated to be necessary to produce the required numbers.(b) Make a best endeavour to grant such applications as may be forthcoming from the Health authorities for Class B releases provided the officers concerned are willing to accept release.(c) Grant compassionate release as generously as possible to doctors who areintending to resume practice.(d) Invalid a number of doctors who are at present classified as unfit forgeneral service.Officers serving abroad will be given priority in air passages wherever possible.5. Some doctors, notably specialists, will have to be retained individuallyunder the military needs clause, to obviate the naval medical service being almostentirely reduced to inexperienced doctors.6. I estimate that releases from the 18th June to the 31st December will reach a total of 900 and that the balance will be dispersed by the middle to endof February.Consequences of the Reduction.7.   The decision of the Cabinet involves  acceptance of  the  followingimportant disabilities :-(a) No ship, even the largest units, can be allowed more than one doctor and ships with a complement of less than 200 to 250 will carry no doctor atall unless operationally engaged.(6) Shore units at home with a complement of less than 500 cannot be allowed a medical officer; the same standards will be applied abroad wherever possible.[31027]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1945. *-*z**
(c) Routine medical examinations must largely be abandoned. In particularthere will have to be a. severe restriction in the procedure for medical examination of officers and men for release on which some 70 doctorsare at present engaged. Men will need to be discharged without a medical examination unless they report a disability or are definitely, sick.   Even then the disability will merely be noted and dischargeproceeded with without the normal invaliding survey.2.   The consequences of this change will be threefold (i) Naval personnel attach importance to a thorough medical examinationon release and there are likely to be strong complaints.(ii) The absence of comprehensive medical reports on the condition of a manat the time of discharge will lead to more claims for disability benefitsupon the Ministry of Pensions who will be hampered in dealing withthem by the lack of medical evidence, and will hinder the Ministryof Labour in dealing with the employment of disabled persons.(iii) The restriction in the activities of hospitals will limit the ability of theAdmiralty to retain under treatment men for whom there is no reasonable prospect of recovery to a state of fitness for general service.These measures involve a marked deterioration in the treatment and disposalof the sick and will damage morale throughout the Naval service.Future.8. A ratio of two doctors per thousand cannot be accepted as sufficient forthe requirements of the Navy and we must reserve the right to be allowed toincrease the number of naval doctors to an acceptable figure as soon as thetemporary shortage of civilian doctors has been relieved.A.
