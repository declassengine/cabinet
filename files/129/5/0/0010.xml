- -THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT        %1Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   3 glj CP. (45) 310.29th November, 1945.CABINET.PRESS ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS BY MINISTERS.Note by the Prime Minister.I should like my colleagues to be aware of the rules and conventions thatgovern the writing of articles in the Press and the granting of Press interviewsby Ministers.(a) Press Articles.Ministers are precluded from journalism in any form; but this prohibitiondoes not extend to authorship of writings of a literary, historical, scientific,philosophical or romantic character.   For these there are abundant precedents.This rule need not be interpreted as debarring Ministers from writingarticles or letters to newspapers, in order to supplement the means already usedfor enlightening the public in regard to measures before Parliament and other administrative questions affecting the work of their Departments.Should a Minister deem it necessary to write such an article he should not accept payment if it is offered. In deciding whether to write an article he should bear in mind his obligations to Parliament. For example, he should be careful notto discuss a Bill before it has received its second reading in the House ofCommons.These rules govern dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.(b) Interviews.The granting of special interviews to individual Press representatives is amatter for the discretion of the Minister concerned. As a general rule, however,the same considerations should apply as for written articles, i.e., if granted, an interview should be confined to elucidating the policy or work of the Minister and
Department concerned. The same considerations regarding obligations toParliament also apply, and Ministers should bear in mind that an interviewgranted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arouse jealousyand thus hostility in the rest of the Press.(c) Contributions to Party publications.The general prohibition on the writing of articles for the Press need notbe regarded as debarring Ministers from contributing to the publications of thepolitical organisations with which they are associated. Payment should notbe accepted for such articles.In general, Ministers should keep such activities to a minimum, and bearin mind that their relations with the Press are always liable to be the subjectof Questions in Parliament. Ministers should refer to me in any case about which they are in doubt.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,29th November, 1945.
