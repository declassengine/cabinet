THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT-Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.Copy No.CABINET.INDIAN SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate two telegrams from the Viceroy in which he proposes a rearrange-ment and some alteration of the draft Statement which I proposed in CP. (45) 301.The disturbances in Calcutta and elsewhere which have occurred since the draft statement was circulated quite, clearly cannot be ignored. I propose therefore to hand round at the meeting of the Cabinet the emendations which I propose in thestatement in order to cover these disturbances and to meet, in part at least, the suggestions of the Viceroy.India Office,26th November, 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 303.26th November, 1945.Telegram from the Viceroy No. 2058-5. of 25th November, 1945.Superintendent Series. Your 25981. From my point Of view I think it essential in the present conditions, which recent events in Calcutta and Bombayhave underlined, that emphasis in proposed statement should be laid on HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s determination that law and order should be maintained and Government servants protected. I therefore recommend in succeedingtelegram a rearrangement of text of statement, wdiich should, I think, be prefacedby a reference to recent riots, as I have suggested in a short paragraph.2. Question of invitation to Parliamentary delegation is being dealt with separately.3. I have to make important speech in Calcutta on the 10th December. Ipresume I may assume that statement will be made before that date.Telegram from the Viceroy, No. 2059-&amp;, dated 25th November, 1945.Superintendent Series. Following is suggested text of announcement as revised. There have recently been serious disturbances in different parts of India,and both in Bombay and Calcutta there have been a number of casualties.Such disturbances constitute a threat to general security, and cannot be allowedto continue unchecked. It is difficult to believe that they are not partly due toinflammatory speeches made in recent months by political leaders.The Government of India cannot divest itself of the responsibility whichrests upon it and upon all Provincial Governments of preserving law and order and of resisting any attempt to resolve the constitutional issue by force. the realisation of full self-government can only come by the orderly and peacefultransfer of control of the machinery of State to purely Indian authority.Moreover, the first great need of a self-governing India will be an efficient andloyal administrative staff who can give effect in a capable and practical mannerto the policies of the new Indian Government when it is set up.   It would be an[30943]
ill-service, therefore, to a future self-governing India to permit the foundations of the State to be weakened and the loyalty of its servants to those who are inauthority to be undermined before that new Government comes into being............His Majesty&apos;s Government could not permit any attempt to be made to breakdown the loyalty of the administrative services or of the Indian armed forces,and they will give full support to the Government of India in securing  hat theirservants are protected in the performance of their duty and that the future constitution of India shall be called into being not by force or threat of force, butby constitutional means alone.The full significance of the proposals made by His Majesty&apos;s government after consultations with the Viceroy in September do not seem to have been properly appreciated in India.The statement made by the Viceroy after his return outlines the steps which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose should be taken to promote the earlyrealisation of full self-government in India.It was a necessary preliminary that election should be held to the provincial legislatures and the Central Assembly in India, because it is the firm intentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government that decisions as to the future government of british india shall be taken by directly elected representatives of the Indian people.It was announced that after the elections in India the Viceroy would holdpreparatory discussions with representatives of British India and with the indian states in order to secure the widest measure of agreement as to the method of framing a constitution. It seems to have been widely assumed in India that these discussions will be a fruitful source of delay. I desire to make it plain thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government regard the setting up of a constitution-making bodyby which. Indians will decide their own future and also other proposals embodied in announcement as a matter of greatest urgency.This misunderstanding has led His Majesty&apos;s Government to considerwhether opportunities of personal contact between this country and India whichhave been greatly interrupted during recent years cannot now be increased. .they regard it as a matter of importance that members of our own Parliament shouldhave an opportunity to meet leading political Indian personalities to learn theirown views at first hand. They would also be able to convey in person the generalwish and desire of the people of this country that India should speedily attain herfull and rightful position as an independent partner State in the British Common-wealth and the desire of Parliament to do everything within our power to promote the speedy attainment of that objective. His Majesty&apos;s Government are thereforearranging for a Parliamentary Delegation to go to India under the auspices ofthe Empire Parliamentary Association. The intention is that this party should leave this country as soon as possible. In view of the difficulties of transport, itwill be limited to eight in number and will be selected by the Association inconsultation with the political parties in this country.
