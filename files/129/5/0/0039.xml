(45) 339.ISth December, 1945.CABINET.Copy No.*j o6 OPROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.   I submit my general proposals for a National Health Service.I should like to be authorised to prepare a Bill on the lines of these proposalsnow, so as to come back to my colleagues with it as early as possible in the newyear. I do not seek detailed decisions until then. But I need a decision nowas to whether this is the broad shape which the Bill should take.2. When my proposals for the hospital part of the service were approved in principle by the Cabinet on the 18th October [CM. (45) 43rd meeting] some further details were asked for, particularly as to the new regional and local administration. These are included in the present paper. Misgivings among someof my colleagues attached to the effect of my proposals on local governmentand more generally to the risk of losing from the health service the benefits of local interest and local knowledge in day-to-day administration. I am alive to the importance of both points.3. I have reviewed, not only the hospital service, but the health service as a whole, in the light of the views expressed at the Cabinet meeting. It isonly by seeing the new service as a whole that we can judge the right shape forits parts.4. As I see it, the undertaking to provide all people with all kinds ofhealth care, using virtually the whole of the medical and other health professionsto do it, creates an entirely new situation and calls for something bolder thana mere extension and adaptation of existing services. Here is an opportunity,which may not recur for years, for a thorough overhaul and reconstruction ofthe country&apos;s health position. I see in this reconstruction a proper place both for local and for central government, as the complementary instruments of the publicwho will be paying for this service through insurance contributions and taxesto the exchequer and through local rates. In a fully modernised service therewill be some things which the State can do better than local authorities, andsome things which local authorities can do better than the State. There is also,in my view, both room and need for giving a voice, in the guiding and providingof the service, to those professional people who will in future be almost whollyabsorbed in it and on whom its success will depend. This will involve in somecases as in the provision for a family doctor service new forms of executivemachinery, in which the representatives of the potential patients and those ofthe professional people undertaking their care can combine.5. I set out my proposals in the appended statement, as shortly as the range of the subject allows. I believe that they will achieve a sensible althoughnew distribution of responsibility between local and central government, thatthey will preserve proper decentralisation (in functions which central govern-ment assumes) so as to keep up a healthly local interest in administration, andthat they will give a useful and reasonable share in future to professional people in helping to steer the service along the right lines.[31041]
6. To keep the proposals as short as possible, I have omitted argument.There is much general matter in the original White Paper with which I agree in particular with the scope of the service to be provided, with the conception of the Health Centre as the new feature of general medical practice, with theimportance of rationalising the hospital services for the first time, with theneed to take the present bits and pieces of the health services as they havehistorically emerged and to recast them into a coherent single new service, and generally with the objective of a universal and free service. On method, however,I often disagree; hence these amended proposals.7. All of this is concerned only with the general treatment services. Ithas to be backed by a review, as we go on, of the environmental provision for health dn local government and otherwise and by a vigorous policy of healtheducation. It leaves untouched, for the present, the question of industrial health and hygiene. It will need to be supplemented, next session, with measures forthe general oare and welfare (other than health treatment) of young children,the aged, the blind and the permanently crippled all of which must become the responsibility of some new service (and, I&apos; hope, a local government service)when the present system of Public Assistance is superseded.8. But the immediate need is to settle the shape of a National health service, backing National Insurance, for a Bill this session. If the appendedproposals commend themselves to my colleagues, I will prepare the Bill. while do this, I propose to meet the representative bodies of the local authorities,medical profession and others, for some discussion of the principal points inthe Bill. But I do not propose, nor would time allow, to embark upon any longseries of negotiations before the Bill is settled. Nor will the Bill itself haveto settle all the details; it will provide the general structure, within which manymatters will have to be later discussed and negotiated.A. B.Ministry of Health, S.W. 1,13th December, 1945.APPENDIX.Summary of Proposals for a National Health Service.1.   The Minister as the central authority.1. General responsibility for the service will rest on the Minister of Health.This will extend to mental, as well as physical, health services the administrativefunctions of the Board of Control in mental health being absorbed by the Minister,and the Board exercising only the quasi-judicial functions relating to the liberty of the subject under the lunacy and mental deficiency Acts.2. The Minister will discharge his general responsibility through three mainchannels: (1) For parts of the service best organised nationally the hospital and specialist services he will assume direct responsibility; but he willdelegate the bulk of administration to new regional and local bodies,acting on his behalf and designed to give scope to people with localexperience and knowledge to serve on them.(2) For parts of the service best organised locally a wide variety of domi-ciliary and clinic services direct responsibility will rest on localgovernment, acting in its ordinary relationship with the Minister;this responsibility will be unified in the present major authorities, thecounty and county borough councils.(3) For new family practitioner services doctor and dentist new localexecutive machinery will be set up, composed partly of members drawn from local authorities, partly of people selected by the Minister, partly of representatives of the doctors and others engaged in the service.These new local bodies will act within national regulations made bythe Minister; and by the side of the Minister there will be a special,mainly professional, body to regulate the distribution of general medical practitioners over the country as a whole.
New central advisory machinery.3. To provide the Minister with expert advice, in the technical planning and conduct of the service, there will be a new Central Health Services Council.This will be a statutory advisory body drawing members from all the main health professions doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and from other fields of relevant technical experience, such as local government and hospital management. It will be appointed by the Minister after consulting the appro-priata organisations.4. In addition to free the Council for its general work on the service asa whole it will have Standing Advisory Committees on special aspects of theservice (medical, hospitals, nursing, mental health services &amp;c). These will beappointed in the same way, after consultation. They will directly advise theMinister, but their advice will be made known to the Central Council as wellso that the Council can pick up points on which its collective views may call for adjustment of the sectional advice of a particular committee. The main council will report each year on its work and that of the committees a report whichthe Minister will normally publish, in full, unless there is any reason of publicinterest for not doing so, when he may withhold it in whole or in part.II. Hospital and Specialist Services.5.   This part of the service will cover the following field : -(a) In-patient care in all types of hospital, including maternity homes,sanatoria, mental hospitals, mental deficiency institutions, convalescenthomes and medical rehabilitation centres.(b) Out-patient care at out-patient departments of hospitals, and at specialistclinics associated with hospitals although not necessarily situated atthem; including mental clinics, tuberculosis dispensaries, venerealdisease clinics, eye clinics.(c) A consultant service of all kinds; based on the hospitals, but providing services not only at them but also at the patients&apos; homes, where necessary, and at Health Centres, clinics, &amp;c.Taking over the existing hospitals.6. The ownership of the present public hospitals, voluntary and municipal,will be taken over by the Minister (subject to special arrangements in the case ofthe teaching hospitals, described later). Provision will be made for the protectionof existing officers and servants. No compensation will be payable in respect of buildings, equipment and other assets including existing funds of the voluntary hospitals. Existing liabilities will be taken over. Where particular hospitalshave hitherto been provided by voluntary subscribers for particular classes or groups of patients only, it will be the aim consistently with the rational planning of the new service -to retain the identity of the special purposes for which thesehospitals have previously been supported, e.g., in a separate wing or otheridentifiable part of the organisation.Regional Hospitals Boards.7. The country will be divided into about twenty natural areas or regionsfor hospital organisation. Each area will be based on one of the eleven universitymedical teaching centres the natural focal points of specialist medicine andtherefore of hospital services. Two or more areas will sometimes base on thesame medical teaching centre, to avoid the areas becoming too big for practicalorganisation.8. For each area or region there will be set up a Regional Hospitals Boardof some 20-30 members, appointed by the Minister and drawn from the majorlocal authorities in the area, from local people selected by the Minister for their general suitability for the work involved (some of whom may be ex-voluntaryhospital experts), and from people representing the university teaching centre and specialist and general medicine in the area. Principal officers of the Boardswill be appointed by the Boards subject to the approval of the Minister.9. Each Regional Board will be required to appoint, subject to the ministers approval, a number of smaller Local Hospital Management Committees. Therewill be one of these committees for each local group of hospitals which together[31041] b 2
form a natural hospital unit in a planned service d.e., one or more main hospitals,with some outlying smaller &quot;feeder &quot; hospitals, together providing about 1,000beds under a common specialist staff, and capable of dealing as a group with allthe more normal hospital needs of their immediate area. - Sometimes a largehospital not needing to be so grouped e.g., a mental hospital will have one ofthose committees to itself. All the committees will be essentially local executivebodies, although their field of operation cannot be restricted to existing localgovernment boundaries. Their members will be drawn from the local authorities of the areas served by the hospitals after consultation with those local authorities,and from other local people selected by the Regional Boards (including, wheredesirable, people of local voluntary hospital experience), together with someprofessional members.10. The Minister will determine with each Regional Board the bestreorganisation of all available hospital and specialist resources in their region,and will supplement those resources as and where necessary, as soon as this canbe done. Owning the hospitals, he will entrust their administration to the regional Boards. The Boards will settle with the Minister each year a budget of normal expenditure, and within that budget will be given as much independenceas possible; abnormal, or excess, expenditure will be under more detailed control.The Boards will make all consultant and specialist appointments in the hospitals regional advisory panels of experts being set up to advise on the professional suitability of candidates.11. The day-to-day work of running the hospitals will then be entrusted bythe Boards to the Local Management Committees. These will be the effectivemanagers on the spot, appointing all ordinary staff of the hospitals, dealing with supplies, handling ordinary running and minor capital expenditure, and generallyacting as the &quot; governing bodies.&quot; In mental hospitals they will take the placeof the present Visiting Committees. The principal officer of each Committee willbe appointed by the Committee with the approval of the Regional Board, and will act also as the chief administrative officer of each hospital covered by theCommittee.Special Provision for Teaching Hospitals.12. Special provision will be made in relation to hospitals providing the bases for the clinical teaching of medical students. They will be taken over bythe Minister like other hospitals, and play their part in the national service; butthey will be given the special status and measure of independence necessary toenable them to take their proper place as academic institutions standing in close association with the universities whose educational needs they must be organised to meet. Universities must be enabled to exercise an effective influence on thepolicy and activities of teaching hospitals. Essential features of the organisationof a teaching hospital emphasised by the Goodenough Committee are a governing body which is personal to the hospital and has wide discretion as to expenditure within a reasonable budget; representation of the university and of the teachingstaff on that governing body; and selection of medical staff (other than holders of university posts) by a special advisory committee, representative of thegoverning body of the hospital and of the university.With these objects in mind it is proposed that the hospitals which are fromtime to time regarded by the universities and the Minister as providing the mainfacilities for undergraduate or post-graduate clinical teaching and research shall&apos; be differentiated from other hospitals in the following manner :-(1) Instead of being entrusted to the ordinary Regional Boards and localmanagement committees described above, the teaching hospital (insome instances the main and associated hospitals which togetherconstitute the teaching centre) will have its own specially constitutedBoard of Governors.(2) The Board of Governors will, as recommended by the GoodenoughCommittee, include reasonable representation of the university and ofthe teaching staff. In addition, it will have members nominated by the regional Hospitals Board and by the Minister (some of whom will bedrawn from the present governing bodies).(3) The teaching hospital will have a separate annual budget approved bythe Minister, and within that budget the Governors will have thefullest discretion in expenditure (subject always to observance of anynationally agreed terms of service and remuneration).   They can
also be allowed to retain various endowments in their possession.Further, the Governors will receive additional funds from universitysources, and will be at liberty to accept them from private sources forexperimental work and innovations in organisation.(4) The Governors will have full freedom to appoint their own staff, and inmaking medical staff appointments will be advised by a special selec-tion committee constituted in the light of the Goodenough Committeerecommendations.13. In London one additional reform is necessary if these proposals forthe development and improvement of medical education are to take full effect namely, the incorporation of the medical schools (as distinct from the teaching hospitals used by the schools) as separate legal entities. At present ten of the twelve London medical schools are legally merely creatures of the teaching hospitals, and ultimate power and responsibility for their conduct lies with thegoverning body of the hospital. The Goodenough Committee strongly recom-mended the ending of this historical anomaly and the granting of legal inde-pendence to the schools by omnibus legislation. The reorganisation of the teaching hospitals proposed above makes this reform essential, and it is thereforeintended to include in the Bill provision for the incorporation of the Londonmedical schools.III. Local Clinic, Domiciliary and Welfare Services.14. This part of the service will be the direct function of local government-of the county and county borough councils and will include -; (a) School medical services.(&amp;) Maternity and child welfare (in co-operation with the hospital service on the specialist side),(c) Domiciliary midwifery.\d) Health visiting.(e) Home nursing services.(/) Home help services for households in time of sickness.(g) Vaccination and immunisation services.(A) Various forms of care and after-care for the sick and those recoveringfrom sickness.(i) A general ambulance service.(j) The provision and maintenance of Health Centres, Dental Centres, and similar local premises as bases for the Family Practitioner service(to be described later).(k) Ascertainment of mental cases.15. There is no need to describe the administrative machinery for these services; it will be the familiar machinery of local government. The generalnature of the services is outlined below. It is proposed that all local authority expenditure on these services should be assisted by an average 50 per cent.lExchequer grant, appropriately weighted to fit the needs of the different areas.Also -so as to ensure the related planning of the health service as a whole thelocal authorities will need to obtain Ministerial approval ho the general content of the services which they provide (just as they do now in Maternity and child welfare and in the School Medical Service; in the case of the School medical service the approval will continue to be that of the Minister of Education).(a) School Medical Service.16.   This is already provided for in the Education Act, 1944.  The ultimateobject must be to make unnecessary the provision of medical treatment by theschool services as such medical inspection, the supervision of the health of the child in the school itself, the conduct of special investigations, and the guidance and persuasion of parents, remaining with them.  For some time, however, muchof the special school treatment provision particularly dentistry -will need tocontinue, until the stage is reached at which it duplicates, and does not supple-I Hent, the general health provision.   The school service is already in the sameI hands as is proposed for the other local services below the counties and countytroughs.
(b) Maternity and child welfare.17. The care of normal maternity and child welfare pre-natal and post-natal clinics, child clinics, confinements in the home, &amp;c. will be the responsibilityof the local authorities. But present powers will be converted into a duty, andwill be concentrated in the counties and county boroughs.18. The specialist and institutional aspects of maternity will be in the care of the hospital and specialist service, organised regionally in the manneralready proposed. Also, for continuity of case treatment, the hospital servicemust itself be able to provide pre-natal clinics for cases destined for confinementin the hospitals rather than in their own homes. In approving local authorities&apos;arrangements the Minister will satisfy himself that these provide for the earlydetection and reference to the specialist service of abnormal or complicated cases,and for ease of access to specialist facilities for all cases for examination and advice.19. The local authorities&apos; child welfare functions will be subject to thesame kind and degree of delegation divisional administration within the localauthority&apos;s area as the school medical service, so that the care of the children under five at school and not at school can run closely in parallel.(c) Domiciliary midwifery.20. As part of their maternity functions the county and county borough councils will be responsible for securing a domiciliary midwifery service for their areas.21. There are at present voluntary associations which provide a domiciliarymidwife service on behalf of some local authorities. Subject to satisfying theMinister that their arrangements will be efficient, the local authorities can stillbe allowed to provide part or all of their service by contract with such agencies on terms to be agreed or, failing agreement, settled by the Minister.(d) Health Visiting.22. Local authorities now provide Health Visiting services under theirmaternity and child welfare functions, and this will go on. But it will be important to extend the scope of it to include many other types of case to whichthe Health Visitor&apos;s attention may be drawn by the family doctor service par-ticularly from the Health Centres. The duties of the county and county borough councils will be enlarged accordingly.(e) Home Nursing.23. A new duty will be put upon the county and county borough councils tomake sufficient provision in their areas for the attendance of properly qualifiednurses on people who require nursing in their own homes usually on the recom-mendation of the family doctor service. Shortage of nurses will at first limit the scope of this service, but the ultimate object will be to secure that whereverthere is genuine need for a nurse in the home, or visiting the home, that nurse willbe publicly provided.24. The same question of the use of voluntary agencies (the present county and District Nursing Associations) will arise, and the local authority can be similarly empowered to contract with such agencies for the provision, in part orin whole, of the service for them subject to satisfying the Minister that thearrangements will be efficient.(f) Home Helps.25. Unless this is covered by a general provision, wider than the health services, the county and county borough councils will be empowered to providedomestic help for households which are in need of it through illness.(g) Vaccination and immunisation.26. The county and county borough councils will be given a new duty tomake arrangements, to the Ministers satisfaction, for anyone in their area to beable to be vaccinated against smallpox or immunised against diphtheria. Theywill have power to do the same for other diseases, and a duty to do so if theMinister so requires. They will normally do this by arrangements with thegeneral practitioners of the area; but this will be a special arrangement, with
separate remuneration, and not part of the &quot; family doctor&apos;s &quot; terms of service;special inducement will be offered, in fact, to encourage development of thepractice.  The present obsolete law on compulsory vaccination will be repealed.(h) Care and after-care of the sick.27. County and county borough councils will be empowered to make suchsupplementary arrangements (other than cash payments) as the Minister mayapprove for the better care and welfare of persons suffering from, or havingsuffered frorm sickness or injury. Examples of this would be the after-care of mental patients, the provision of milk and additional nourishment in certain cases, the loan of blankets, and guidance and help in getting suitable living conditions (e.g., in tuberculosis).(i) Ambulance Services.28. The county and county borough councils will be given the duty of -providing an adequate ambulance service for the use of the inhabitants of their areas, but with provision for the vehicles to undertake all necessary inter-areajourneys without regard to boundaries. The hospital service will, no doubt,need itself to provide certain hospital transport, but it will in the main look to arrangements with the local authorities for its ambulance services.(j) Health Centres.29.   The functions of the local authorities in this connection are dealt with under the Family Practitioner Services below.(k) Ascertainment of Mental Cases.30. County and county borough councils will have the duty of making arrangements for the early detection and reference to the hospital and specialistservice of mental patients or mental deficients requiring care or treatment underthe lunacy and mental deficiency Acts.IV. Family Practitioner Services.31. This part of the service will cover general medical care by a personal,or family, doctor with necessary medicines, drugs and appliances to be avail-able to the whole population as from an appointed day. General dental care :with necessary dentures will be developed as fast as the supply of dentistsallows. There will be priority dental provision from the outset, however, formothers and children. (This priority dentistry will be provided by local authori-ties through their maternity and child welfare services and school medical service-and it is not affected, therefore, by the following proposals for the more general service.)32. A principal objective from the outset, in the general medical and general dental services, will be the development of the Health Centre system, equippingthe practitioner with publicly provided premises, apparatus and ancillary staff.This system will be developed as fast and as widely as possible. The arrangementsfor the provision of the Centres and the engagement of the doctors and dentistsin them are referred to below.33. While the Health Centre system is developing, it will be supplemented by arrangements with doctors in separate practice to join in the service fromtheir own surgeries. This will be so arranged that everyone can be assured ofa family doctor from the outset either in a Health Centre or not. For dentistry,this assurance cannot be given until more practitioners are available, but duringthe development of the Health Centre system arrangements will be made to supplement it as much as possible by enabling individual dentists to treat patientsat the cost of the new service wherever this can be arranged.local Executive Committees.34. There will be a new system of Local Executive Committees for the family practitioner services. There will be a Committee for each county and countyborough area, but with power to the Minister to combine two or more areasunder one Committee, wherever desirable. Each Committee will have a chairman,appointed by the Minister, and one half of its members will represent the&quot;consumer &quot; interest, the public, while the other half represents the professional
people providing the service doctors, dentists and chemists. Of the public trepresentatives, two-thirds will be nominated by the Local Authority of the area ?and the other third by the Minister.35.   The functions of the Local Executive Committee will be : (a) making all arrangements to secure general practitioner services for their area in accordance with the Act and regulations made under the Act;(6) entering into the necessary contracts with and remunerating-the doctors, dentists and chemists taking part in the family practitionerservices, both in Health Centres and outside;(c) providing the necessary disciplinary machinery (through sub-committees or otherwise, as the Act and regulations will prescribe) for the hearing of complaints and disputes between patient and doctor, patient andchemist and so on with proper appeals to the Minister;(d) compiling, and making known to the public, lists of the doctors, dentistsand others available for their service, in the Health Centres and outside; and generally arranging for the selection of doctors, &amp;c,by the patients and the allocation to doctors of those unable-or unwilling to make their own selection;(e) providing regular information as to the situation of the general Ipractitioner services of their area (e.g., of the need for more doctors, or less, to meet local requirements). jHealth Centres.36. The provision and maintenance of Health Centre (including- DentalCentre) premises and equipment and of nursing, secretarial and other ancillarystaff will rest with the county and county borough councils. It can thus becorrelated with their provision of child welfare clinics, school clinics, and other activities. To arrange for the use of the Centres by doctors and dentists in the family practitioner services, the local authority will in each case deal with the \new Local Executive Committee, which will be contracting with the doctors and dentists for these services generally and on which the local authority will havesubstantial representation. The doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; general terms of servicecovered by national regulations, will cover the terms and conditions governingtheir use of Health Centres provided by local authorities. The doctors and dentists will thus remain in contract with the Local Executive Committee andbe remunerated by it, whether inside or outside the Centres, to secure unity andmobility throughout the family practitioner services.Remuneration of Doctors.37.   Doctors working in Health Centres, whole-time or part-time, will be Ipaid a basic salary, as part of their public income; the rest of a &quot; sum due&quot;!to each of them will be pooled in the Centre and divided among the doctors under Isomething like a partnership agreement.   The &quot;sum due&quot; will be calculated 1on a capitation rate for all patients in the care of the doctors in the Centre, Iwhile being distributed among them as above.   Doctors working outside theiHealth Centres (while these are being developed) will similarly be paid a basic part-salary, the rest of their remuneration depending on a capitation rate in Irespect of patients on their lists.38. All remuneration of doctors, under either system, will be fixed by national regulations and will have regard to any national standards recommended 1by the present Spens Committee or any subsequent body set up for the purpose.!Scales of remuneration will be so arranged as to admit of extra inducement to Ipractise in less attractive areas (probably by increase in the basic part-salary Iscales in areas recommended for this purpose by the Central Committee on the!Distribution of Practices (below)) and of extra rewards for special qualifications. IRemuneration of Dentists.39. Dentists, working whole-time or part-time- in Health Centres orlDental Centres will be remunerated entirely by salary, in proportion to theirIattendance at the Centre. Supplementary arrangements will be made, while the!Centre system is developing, whereby dentists accepting any patient under theipublic service in their own surgeries can be paid on a scale of fees for approved Iwork done.   This scale can provide for payment for minor or urgent work on I
claims submitted after the event (to avoid delay for the patient); but for more substantial work, the dentist will submit what he proposes to do for approval bya new small professional body, which will have branch offices about the country.40. All remuneration of dentists, by salary or under scales of fees, will befixed by national regulations and will have regard to national standards recom-mended by a body analogous to the Spens Committee for doctors, or other bodyset up for the purpose.Central Committee on the Distribution of Medical Practices.41. The Minister will set up a new Central Committee, working under thegeneral directions, to supervise the distribution of medical man-power in the family doctor service. The Committee will be small and mainly professional.&apos;It will be appointed after consulting the professional organisations, and will beprovided with, staff and offices by the Minister.42.   Supervision will be exercised by this Committee in the following way : (a) all doctors wishing to start new practices or to change from one practice to another wholly or partly in the public service will normallyapply to the Local Executive Committee for the area to which they wish to go;(b) the Local Executive Committee will inform the Central Committee of theapplication, of their views on the need for the new practice or replace-ment and on the suitability of the applicant, and of any other relevant facts; and the Central Committee, in consultation with the LocalExecutive Committee as necessary, will then decide whether the prac-tice in question is needed to be started or to be taken over by thenewcomer and, if it is needed, will decide which applicant (if thereis more than one) should fill it; they will then give any necessary con-sents, and the Local Executive Committee will inform applicantsaccordingly;(c) this control will apply to all doctors going into an area to staff newHealllr^entres or to fill vacancies in existing Centres or to take partin the public service in any degree from their own surgeries; it need not apply to doctors, already in an area, simply changing fromtheir own surgeries into Health Centre practice, or to doctors taking part in the public service in areas wdiere they are at the outset of thescheme;(d) questions of reasonable special discretion in cases of sons taking overfathers&apos; practices, relatives joining existing partnerships, &amp;c, can bedealt with under the Minister&apos;s power of general direction of theCommittee.Sale and Purchase of Medical Practices. Compensation and Superannuation.43. This control of distribution will destroy the selling value of practices.Proposals in regard to the compensation of existing practitioners, and for asuperannuation scheme for the future, have already been approved by theCabinet on the 3rd December and need not be repealed here (CM. (45) 58thmeeting).Drugs, &amp;c.44. People will be entitled to obtain all necessary drugs, &amp;c, on prescription-tion, either from qualified chemists in their own shops or from dispensariesprovided at the Health Centres, as the patient finds convenient.45. For supply by individual chemists, the Local Executive Committee willhave the duty of making arrangements within general regulations of theMinister. Lists will be published of the chemists available, with a right to theMinister to remove any chemist from the list after proper inquiry. Chemistswill be paid by the Committee at nationally prescribed rates.46. For supply in the Plealth Centres, the local authority providing theCentre will be able to employ such dispensing chemists as are needed, as partof the ordinary staffing of the Centre. Dispensing at the Centre will be designed, v/here provided, for the convenience of patients and will, therefore,riot amount to a monopoly; the patient must be free to take his prescriptions thereor to any individual chemist (e.g., nearer his home).[31041]
V&apos;.-Other Services.(1) Eye Service.47. The objective will be the provision of special clinics, as part of thehospital service, at which all will be entitled to eye-testing and the supply ofspectacles. These clinics will be staffed by ophthalmologists (i.e., full eyespecialists on hospital staffs) and refractionists (i.e., sight-testing opticians).The ophthalmologists will be in charge, but the extent to which they delegateeye-testing to refractionists will be a matter of internal arrangement.48. Pending the development of this complete clinic service, the clinicswill be supplemented on the following lines :- (a) People needing eye-testing and appliances will be free to go (i) to an ophthalmologist or other medical eye specialist recognised as competent for testing and prescription, and to a dispensingoptician for appliances; or(ii) to a sight-testing optician recognised as competent for sight-testing and the provision of appliances.(b) The Local Executive Committees (for the Family, Practitioner Services),reinforced for this purpose by representatives of medical and non-medical sight-testing practitioners, will be made responsible for thepreparation and publication of lists of approved practitioners fortheir areas, for the inspection and supervision of premises, for thepayment of nationally prescribed fees, and for the hearing of complaints (with appeal to the Minister).(2), Public Health Laboratories.49. A public health pathological laboratory service will be provided on anational basis by the Minister, in the first instance through the agency of theMedical Research Council. The powers of local authorities to provide laboratorieswill continue. The object of the Ministers service will be to supplement whatis done already and to perpetuate the useful developments of the war-timeemergency service.(3) Blood Transfusion.50. The Minister will be empowered to make national arrangements for obtaining supplies of human blood, for making these available for transfusionand for preparing and supplying blood products.VI. Charges for Certain Services.51. The normal position will be that the whole range of the health service will be available free of charge to all who wish to use it the cost being met partly from, the Exchequer, partly from local rates (with Exchequer subsidy), partly from the produce of national insurance contributions. There will be some partsof the service, however, or supplements to the service, in which some payment bythe patient will arise, as follows : (a) Home Helps (paragraph 25 above) will need to be the subject of a chargeaccording to the ability of the household to pay.(b) Certain supplements, like the provision of special foods in maternity and child welfare or the provision of bedding in after-care services, may need to be the subject of charges or part-charges.(c) Appliances will be supplied free, up to a standard sufficient to restore the fullest possible working capacity and with reasonable amenity.But there will have to be charges for premature renewal (in case ofnegligence, &amp;c). Also it must be possible (eg., in the case of spectaclesor dentures) for those who wish to obtain articles of &quot; luxurystandard i.e., over and above the good and sound article publiclyprovided to do so by paying the difference.id) In hospital, the free service will provide all that is necessary to a good,and not a minimum, standard. But it will be open to people to obtainadditional amenities (e.g., private rooms, where those are not medicallynecessary) by payment of the extra cost involved.(e) In some hospitals provision will be made (in separate parts of the hospital)to enable any specialist staff engaged only on a part-time basis to see
their private patients there and to admit them to pay-bed accomrho-dation if they so choose; provided that (i) this is restricted to specialists serving in the hospital;(ii) the private patients&apos; fees are within a controlled scale;(iii) there   is   no  encroachment   on   necessary   general   hospital accommodation;(iv) the whole arrangement is so designed as to further its purposes,which are to prevent the national hospital service driving allprivate work into a rival nursing home service and to encourage the fuller association of the specialists with their hospitals in all their professional activities.VII. Finance of the Service.52. In 1938-9 the expenditure on the partial services then providedamounted to about  66 million, of which local authority services accounted for 41 million, voluntary hospitals for  11^ million, and medical benefit under national health insurance for  13^ million. The expenditure was met as follows(ignoring the effect of the block grant to local authorities) :   ^million.National health insurance contributions      ...      ...      11-2Taxpayer ...       ...      ...       ...      ...      ...      ...        3-0Ratepayer ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      40-3Voluntary sources ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      11-566 053. Only very approximate estimates are possible of the cost to public funds of the comprehensive health service proposed in this paper. It will be muchgreater because the service is comprehensive instead of partial; because no chargeswill normally be made to patients; because salaries will be payable to doctorsat hospitals; because of the payment of compensation for the abolition of sale and purchase of practices; because of the cost of superannuation schemes; and because of the general rise in salaries and prices. In the early years of the service the annual expenditure might be  145 million, of which hospital and specialist services would account for  87 million, local authority services for  12 million,general practitioner, dental and eye services for  41 million, and compensation and superannuation for  5 million. This expenditure would be met as follows(again ignoring the effect of the block grant) :    million.National insurance contributions       ...      ...      ...      35-7*Ratepayer ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        6-0&apos;Taxpayer.....................     103-3145-0Against this would be offset some saving to the exchequer by reduction in block grant consequent on the reduction in local authority expenditure, and the benefitof the accumulated funds of voluntary hospitals dedicated to hospital purposes.VIII.
