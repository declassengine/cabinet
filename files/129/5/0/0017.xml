tjs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SjLg R E TJOTH NOVEMBER.COPY NO. L&apos;?6CABINETCALL-UP, OF MEN FROM THE BUILDING AND BUILDINGMigb^^A^iff? By.....the Joint.....ParliCTiqntory; Uncler-^Secrotaryof State &quot;for. scotland in his report CP. (1+5) 311  the Chairman of the Man-Power Committee rocoimaends that those men in the buildingindustry and the building materials and components industrieswhoso call-up was postponed following a decision of theMan-Power Committee (M.P. (1+5) 12th Meeting)  should now &quot;becalled up.      It is my considered view that if thisrecommendation is accepted its effect on the housing programme will be most serious.2.      I recognise that the acceleration of Class A releaseswill be helpful and I welcome the proposal to increase theproportion of releases under Cless 3.      I appreciate theforce of the argument that it is important to maintain theprinciple that the call-up of y mug men shall continue,it the same time I feel most strongly that to coll up a singlman from the Building and building materials industry atthis stage male us nonsense of our- repeated undertaking thatfirst priority is to &quot;be given to housing.      I have beenbringing pressure to Bear on both sides of the industryand on local authorities to press on with house building tothe fullest extant,  and the public expect substantial progresto be made in the immediate future,      Against this backgroundit will be very difficult to justify the calling up of menfrom those industries which are vital to the housing drive,I feel that -if the position is presented to the Forces inits pre or perspective they will understand and accept the exemption from call-up of men in the building and building materials industries.      There is not the slightest doubtthat the bulk of members of the Forces are   more concerned about, housing difficulties than anything else,3.      It is argued that the Increase in the quota of Class 3releases and the acceleration in Class A releases will morethan compensate for the call-up of men under 30.      It isobvious,&apos; however,  that if we are to moke a serious attackon the housing problem and to carry   through our programmewe need ov&amp;ry man we can    obtain.      Again, one of our main difficulties&apos;at present is that the building industry isage-heavy.      What we need at pros-, nt is a greater number of active young men still under 30, - the very class which    itis  proposed^to withdraw from the building force.      It hasto be remembered that the men returning from the Forces have been away iron their trades for anything from two to fouryears and require time to settle in again-

k* I would therefore urge with the utmost vigourthat the Man-Power Committee&apos;s roconracndction should   bere considered.        I appreciate that it is difficult tomake an exception in favour of specific industries but,since housing is Hohorally admitted to be our most urgent domestic problem, I consider that on exceptionin the case of the building and building materialsindustries is amply justified, and would bo accepted by public opinion as a necessary feature of the Government&apos;housing policy.G.3.Scottish Office, t.30th November,  19U5-*
