HpOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)cabinet british AIR SERVICES. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Civil aviation attach a paper which I circulated to the Committeeon the Socialization of Industries (GEN 98/7) and a copy ofa Draft White Paper as revised following the meeting of theCommittee on Tuesday.    I ask the approval of my colleagues to the&apos; four proposals set out in paragraph 15 of GEN 98/7,(Initialled)      W.Briel House, Strand, W.C. 2.11TH DECEMBER5   19k5-

/GEN 98/777TK pECE;CBER, 19d5Ci-BINETSOCIALISATION OP INDUSTRIESSOCIALISATION AGP1;C?S OF CIVIL AVIATION POLICYMemorcncton by the Ldnistcr of Civil Aviation1.      The purpose of this paper is to seek approval (i) for theissue of the draft White Paper at Appendix C and (ii) for themethods by which I propose to operate air services pendinglegislation and in preparation for the formation of the newCorporations.      The White Paper is self-explanatory.2.      On 25th October the Cabinet agreed to the establishmentof three publicly owned Corporations with the followingspheres of action (C.M. (k5) dj.6):-(a) B.O.A.C between the United Kingdom and theBritish Commonwealth, the United Statesand the Par East;(b) A European Corporation between the United Kingdomand the Continent, as well as the internalroutes within the United. Kingdom;   &apos;(c) A South American Corporation to operatebetween the United Kingdom and SouthAmerica.3.     Para. 15 of my draft White Paper refers to interim arrangements for running air services, pending the passingof legislation affecting the above three Corporations.      Inaccordance   with the White Paper my task is to find the mostpracticable way of getting services started as soon aspossible.U*      No problem arises as regards the B.O.A.C.      This isrunning on the Empire routes and to a limited degree acrossthe Atlantic and will continue to do so,5.     Para. 1(b).      European Services.      These are at present,being run by 110 Wing of Transport Command using Lend/LeaseDakotas.      I cannot civilianise these services at the moment,because Lease/Lend Dakotas cannot be used for commercial purposes.      The P.O.A.C.  is working in close touch with 110 Wingand is arranging to take over gradually general services, suchas traffic handling, and as and when suitable aircraft become available,  the operation of European routes.      It isnecessary,  therefore,  for some time to come that 110 Wingand the B.0.A.C,  should work in close harmony in running the existing,  although admittedly insufficient, network of services to Continental capitals.

6*      Internal Services.      A network of services is operating in this country under the supervision of the AssociatedAirways Joint Committee (A,A. J.C. ) , which is composed ofrepresentatives of the small air transport companiescontrolled by the railways, and in which coastal shipping companies have also an interest.     Particulars of theA,A.J.C* are given in Annex A to this paper.7.      I propose to leave A.A.J.C.  to run its services as atpresent, and to appoint two members to the Board of.O.A.C. who will, during the interim period, concern themselves with all that is involved in the civilianisationof 110 Wing*     When legislation is passed,  the EuropeanCorporation will be formed by merging A.A.J.C. and thecivilianised 110 Wing under a new Board, which I  shall appoint,  and of which the two additional members of.O.A.C. will be part.8,      British South. American Airways.      The position here istnat a registered Company exists, owned by certain shipping lines, under the name of British South American Airways,The Chairman of the Company, Mr.  John Booth of theBooth Steamship Line, has severed his effective connectionwith the Line ard has been acting as Chairman of theB.S.A.A,      Associated with him is Air Vice-Marshal Bennett,an experienced airline pilot, under whose direction an organisation has been built up of which particulars aregiven in Annex B.9*      I have examined the composition of this organisationand am satisfied tnat it can be entrusted with the initiation of a service to South America.      My proposal is that theexisting directors of B,S.A.A.  should resign and that Ishould appoint a new board of directors.      B.O.A.C. will then purchase the undertaking, B.S.A.A.  thus becoming a subsidiary of  the B:.:O.A.C., but retaining its own fullyresponsible Bo arc&quot;.      When the Air Transport Bill receivesthe Royal Assent a new Corporation would be formed,consisting of the Board I have mentioned above, withpossibly one or two additions,  and that Board would beempowered to buy the undertaking back from B.O.A.C.10.    Under the arrangements I have outlined, above,  I  canundertake to start a service to South America almost atonce, with a wholTV publicly owned company.      I can ensurethat the internal services in this country will continueto function efficiently and be expanded under the associated Airways Joint Committee, whilst the Europeanservices will carry on as at present on a militarisedbasis, being civilianised as soon as equipment andcompetent staff allow.      They will also ensure a smoothtransfer, when the Air Transport Bill has been passed,from the interim organisation to the two new Corporations.

11.    The only alternative to the above arrangement wouldbe to ask the B.O.A.G.   to take over all operations in the interim period.      Apart from the fact that the B.O.A.C,cannot legally operate the internal services,  it would be politically objectionable to entrust everything to theB.O.A.C.      To do so would deny us the advantage of makinguse of the- excellent people employed by and organisationsbuilt up by the other bodies, which can continue or atonce &quot;begin operating.      It would create difficulties informing the new Corporations when legislation is passed,and would indelibly-&quot; impress the new bodies with theB.O.A.C.  stamp.      In short,  the alternative means delay and decreased efficiency.12,    If I am authorised to proceed on the basis I propose,I would propose to issue the attached White Paper (Annex C)which has been promised to Parliament, in clarificationand amplification of the statements made in &quot;both Houses.13*    As regards the formation of the Boards, I wish atonce to (a) re-constitute the Board of the B.O.A.C.,(b)  appoint a new poard of the B.S.A.A. which will eventually become the Board of the new S. .americanCorporation, (c)  appoint members to the Board of theB.O.A.C,  to pave the way for the creation of the Boardof the New European Corporation.lh.    My sole criterion in making these appointments wouldbe experience and ability.      No particular interest wouldbe allowed to predominate.      I should regard it as in theinterests of Civil fviation that -if otherwise qualifiedon the score of experience and ability, one at least, &quot;butnot more than two members with shipping and railwayexperience should serve on the Boards of the South american and European Corporations respectively,      Mr. Booth, who asI have mentioned, has severed his direct connection withthe Booth Line and. who has build up the organisation referredto in para.  S would,  I consider, be a valuable Chairman forthe S.&apos; American Corporation, and Sir Harold Hartley, whohas directed the operations of the A.A.J.C. with great success,  for the European Corporation,  if he would be willing to serve.      My view is that the Boards of the corporations should be 9 to 11 strong as experience dictates.I should not propose to fill up to this number immediatelyas undoubtedly talent will come to light for which I should wish to have vacancies in hand-.15*    I therefore ask approval  to:(a) instruct the B.O.A.C.   to purchase B.S.A.A.(b) nominate a new Board for B.S.A.A. withMr. Booth as Chairman.(c) designate Sir Harold Hartley (if willing)as Chairman of the new European Corporation.(d) issue the: attached White Paper.W.Ariel House6th December, 19^5

SecrejbDRAFT   WHITE ; PAPERBRITISH   AIR......SERVICESPrinciples and Objectives1.     His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to secure the universalacceptance of conditions which would ensure the orderly expansion ofair transport.     The nations, however, are not yet prepared to placetheir air services under the. control of a single international owningand operating body and there is insufficient support to make possiblethe formation of such bodies on a regional basis. ....2.     Attempts, at the Chicago Conference to achieve a plan oforderly development in the air were not successful.     Accordingly, theplan which His Majestyrs Government now present to parliament is&apos;necessarily a national plan, but it has been so framed that It can be readily fitted into any future scheme of international organisation.3*     It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to endeavour tonegotiate agreements with other countries in conformity -vith their ultimate objective of securing well-ordored development on a fullinternational basis and so facilitate the later establishment of a multilateral Convention based on order in the air.k-*     Coramonwe alth Co-ope r at ion.     Arrangements for Commonwealthco-operation have been made.     By agreement with the Governmentsconcerned, services on Commonwealth air routes will be operated in parallel by independent national air lines under partnership arrange-monts which will provide for pooling of traffic receipts, avoidence of/duplicationciv.327.
duplication, and common user of facilities required by operators and forequitable division of receipts and expenditure.     If and when DominionGovernments so desire, these arrangements lend themselves readily totransformation into joint organisations for particular routes or into a commonwealth Corporation to operate all Commonwealth trunk services,    gMajesty&apos;s Government ass prepared to negotiate with foreign Governmentssimilar arrangements for the formation of joint undertakings to operateservices on routes of mutual interest.Corporate Structure of United Kingdom Air Transport services.     General principles of Organisation. - In consonance with these general objectives His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that air transpiservices of the United Kingdom, as a public service, should be p&amp;fecedunder national ownership and control.     This policy offers the bestguarantee to the public of disinterested expansion of the nation&apos;s air services with economy and efficiency.     It will make it-possible ascosts of operation are progressively reduced for the taxpayer toreceive some benefit in return for the assistance he is. required toprovide during the initial period of State aided operation and, where this is essential, to develop uneconomic as well as profitable services!6.     In the present stage of development they do not propose to entrust the operation of all services to a single Corporation.     In reaching thiconclusion they arc influenced by the following considerations:-(i)   The need for flexibility in meeting current conditions ofinternational competition;(ii)the encouragement of different methods of approach to thotechniques ofthe various aspects of airline operation;the avoidance during the initial stages of starting up a new service of placing into the hands of one managerial groupthe responsibility for matters having great and decisivenational importance and. tho desirability, again in the initial stages of affording alternative opportunities of employment to individuals desiring to make air transport their career.
(tv)    the creation of a pool of knOTrlsdge &quot;and experience&apos; tomeet the needs of the rapid expansion of air travel whichis to bs anticipated;7.   &apos; Number of Air Transport Organisation/ - The number of air transport undertakings ultimately &quot;desirable in the national interest can be decidedonly in the light of experience.     Initially&quot;, His Majesty&apos;s government propose to establish three separate &quot;statutory Corporations1 &quot;with the followingspheres of responsibility:-(a) Routes between the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries, the United States and the far east (the existingB.O.A.C).(b) Routes between the United Kingdom and the Continent-and internal routes in the United Kingdom;(c) Routes between the United Kingdom and South America.8.     The Corporations will not compete with each other on the same routeor in the same area,  and the desirability of creating additional operatingunits will be considered as expansion of services or the needs of particular services appear to justify.     Each of the proposed Corporations will be managed by its own Board and its capital will bo provided entirely by theGovernment.9.     Constitution,off the Boards. - The sizo of the Boards must bedetermined by experience in the light of practical requirements but theymust not bo unwieldy.     They will include members who can contribute expertknowledge of the major aspocts of airline operation.     Pro vis ion. will alsobe made for members with experience of surface transport and others awaroof the needs of users in general.     This will facilitate co-operation insuch matters as intor-changeability of air and surface transport services,co-ordination of time-tables and joint use of traffic booking agencies andother suitable facilities, and co-operation in the various aspects ofcommon interest in the side--by-sido operation of the different forms of&quot;&quot;rails port,
- h. -10.    Training of aircrew and ground staff.  -     The Corporations will beexpected to maintain the highest degree of operational efficiency and safety;consequently they must have responsibility for the final training of theiraircrews and ground staffs.     Unnecessary duplication of training facilitiesmust, however, be avoided and the possibility of combined arrangements forbasic training is being examined.11,   Maintenance and Overhaul of Aircraft.    -       Whilst day-to-day maintenancecannot he dissociated from the operations of the individual Corporations,some saving in the provision of facilities for overhaul of aircraft and engines may be possible by the adoption of centralised arrangements and this possibility is being examined,12,    Staff recruitment and -welfare. -   Under arrangements made withthe Air Council and Board of Admiralty, opportunities will be provided to officers and men of the R.A.F. and Fleet Air Arm to enter civilaviation.     It must be borne in mind, however, that even the mostflourishing civil aviation which can be developed in the immediate futurecan provide only relatively few openings for the large numbers of officersand men becoming available for release.se from the Services.13-    The Corporations will be required to ensure satisfactory standards in the conditions of service and welfare of all employees, and to establishmachinery for the negotiation of remuneration and conditions of service with representative bodies of all classes of employee.      The promotion ofschemes to facilitate staff co-operation in the management of the corporations will be encouraged./&quot;14.
-5-       : 1^614.    Interim arrangements -     The policy set out in this White Paper will he put into effect at the earliest possible moment, but will require legislation.No delay in starting British air services, however, will be countenanced.Interim arrangements have been made to this end but supply of aircraft is thegoverning factor.Relations between the Minister and the Corporations.15.    The major policy of air transport development and the broad range ofthe activities of the Corporations will he vested in the Minister of CivilAviation.     He will make all appointments to the Boards.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, however, regard it as important that, subject to the requirementsof their general policy, the Corporations should,have the maximum freedom inthe operation and management of the air services assigned t* them.     in deciding to set up three Corporations, for the purpose of securing theadvantages of flexibility and initiative in the approach stgi the problems of airline operation, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire to stultify thispolicy by imposing unnecessary limitations on freedom of management.16.    Fares and adequacy of services.      Machine.ry will he established whereby,as regards internal services, the public will he enabled to make representationsconcerning&apos;fares, rates and adequacy of services.      As regards fares and rates on external services, it is hoped that these will be.settled by international agreement, full account being taken of the recommendations of the international air Transport Association, a recently-formed Association of the internationalairline operators of the world.Subsidies.17.    (a)   Policy.      It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that air services should be made.self-supporting as soon as possible.      They will seek by international agreement to eliminate all forms of subsidy.      H.M.G.  recognise,however, that if air transport is to fulfil its function of providing services in the public interest, some measure of State aid may he necessary to supportessential hut unremunerative services./(b)
(b)   Basis of payment.     As the capital required for the nation&apos;s airit^transport services will &quot;be provided from public funds, profits will enure to,&apos;and deficits will be borne by, the Exchequer.     During an initial period,until experience has been gained of commercial operations with untried types of aircraft, any direct subsidy assistance which may be required will take theform of deficiency grants.     During this initial period there will be closercontrol over estimates and expenditure than will be necessary when stabilityhas been achieved.     When experience has been gained under stable conditions,it is proposed to base any direct assistance from the Exchequer on a systemof estimates of target costs and revenues which would be subject to annual review.     To provide an incentive to economy, provision will be made toenable a Corporation to.retain in the undertaking a proportion of any savings on estimated grants, to.be expended on general purposes to be approved by theMinister with the agreement of the Treasury,Aerodromes.18.    It is proposed that all transport aerodromes required forscheduled. air services shall be- acquired and managed &quot;try the Ministry ofCivil Aviation.      Present and projected types of aircraft involve heavy capital and maintenance expenditure on l*ng concrete runways and ancillaryfacilities.        The revenue from landing fees would, in most cases, be insufficient to meet outgoings and State aid would be necessary towards meeting any deficit.     Moreover, many privately owned and municipal aerodromes,which have been requisitioned during the war have been developed at theexpense of public funds and acquisition of these airfields by the state would be an economical and simpler solution of the problems of de-requisitioning.The State has, for many years, undertaken the provision of meteorological,radio and control services and, in the changed circumstances, it is a naturaldevelopment of this policy that the State should own the aerodromes.      It isnot proposed that the State should acquire non-transport aerodromes suchas those used by clubs or for training and private flying. j/ The     -
19.     The international standards and procedures to be adopted in respectof airports, air traffic control, communications systems, air navigationaids and related questions are already the subject of investigation by aCommittee on Air Navigation which is sitting at Montreal as part of theprovisional&apos;International Civil Aviation Organisation, which-was set up atChicago, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to cooperate to thefullest degree in the expansion of international agreement on these important particulars.20.    His Majesty&apos;s Government, as an adherent of the Interim and international Air Services Transit Agreements concluded at Chicago, have accepted an obligation to provide the airports and ancillary facilities(including customs and immigration requirements) required for international air services.      Under these Agreements each country reserves, to itself theright to declare the particular airports which are.to be opened to international air services, without discrimination to nationality or rates charged for landing fees. &apos;   They will be equipped to Internationally agreed standards.Such airports, which are technically known as &quot;designated&quot; airports, shouldbe selected with due regard to the line of&quot; the direct route on which theservices operate.      Until Heathrow is ready Hurn, near Bournemouth, Prestwick,in Scotland, and possibly one other airport will be designated as trans-oceanic airports.     Heathrow will he designated as the long-distance airportfor London and will be developed to the highest international standardsrequired for trans-oceanic aircraft.      Croydon will be used as the london airport for internal and European traffic in the period immediately ahead.It will be necessary to provide alternative airports for use when bad weather or emergency prevents landing at the airports designated for normal use.      These emergency alternatives will be selected from amongsuitable available R.A.F. airfields.21.    It has already been stated that Prestwick will be designated as an airport available for international use.     Plans have been made for certain/of
of our trans-Atlantic services to be operated via Prestwick, the number tobe dependent on traffic demands.    This decision is part of the policy toensure&apos; that Scotland will be able to play its full part in civil aviation wiregard both to services and to airports, by the opportunities provided for internal services,, services between Scotland and the rest, of the UnitedKingdom and direct services between Scotland and overseas countries,22,     Airports will also be provided in Northern Ireland, Wales and otherparts of the United Kingdom to standards suitable for flying direct to theContinent as well as to other.parts of the U.K.25*      The policy will.be to locate airports to serve the needs of the publicBut this small island cannot afford to have a multiplicity of airfields, andif the needs of civil and military aviation were kept quite separate therewould be great waste.   The.R.A.P. will, therefore, be invited to share theuse of airports whose primary purpose is to serve civil aviation, and, inreturn, civil aircraft will share airfields primarily used by the R.A.P., incases where a balance of convenience and economy will result.compensation ation.24r*      (a)    Airline Operators.    Payment will be made for physical assetstaken over from airlines operating 1st November, 1945, the date of announcement of Government policy.   His Majesty1s Government do not considerthat there is any case for payment of compensation for goodwill.     no compensation will be allowed in respect of any air line operations whichmight be commenced hereafter and would have to be discontinued as a resultof legislation to give effect to the policy of the Government.(b)    Aerodromes.    Compensation equitable to both parties will bepaid- for airfields to be taken over from municipalities and private owners.Aircraft.25.      It will be the general policy of His Majesty1s Government to requirethe Corporations to use British aircraft types.    As a result of wartime/policies
policies agreed with our Allies, transport aircraft were not produced in thiscountry during the war, and the development of British civil aircraft hasbeen interrupted since 1938*   At the moment we are-, on this account,placed at a grave disadvantage.   Civil air services in the immediatefuture must, therefore, be built up on aircraft which have been developedfrom basic military types.    These will be followed by aircraft mainlybased on types recommended by the Brabazon Committee,    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are taking all possible steps to accelerate the production ofcivil aircraft both for the equipment of British air lines and for theexport trade.26*     Research and Development and Design of Aircraft. - Air line operationdepends for its advancement on technical progress, for success or failureis more dependent on the type of equipment used than on any other factor.Creative research and development, therefore, is indispensable to advancementin an industry of which technical progress is the life blood.   An air line,equipped with outmoded aircraft, no matter how efficiently its operations and business are conducted, will soon be outdistanced by another using aircraft of superior and more economical performance.    The fullest emphasis will therefore be laid on research and. development connected with air lineoperation.    It is not proposed to set up a separate research department for civil Aviation, but Civil Aviation will receive equal status with otherclaimants in aeronautical research fostered by the State,    Arrangements havealready been made   for representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation tojoin on an equal footing with representatives of the Services in theM.A.P. Committees which determine the allocation of design resources andthe priority of development projects.27.     The characteristics required in civil aircraft can best be discoveredor proved by experience in operation.    There must therefore be collaboration between user, designer and producer of the aircraft.    Arrangements have beenmade to ensure close and continuing collaboration between the air transportcorporations, the aircraft producers and the responsible GovernmentDepartments.    These arrangements will ensure that every facility isprovided for the individual corporations to obtain aircraft incorporating/theciv.  327.
the features they consider necessary to successful operation of*their air services.Other Flying Activities.28*     Charter and Taxi Flying. -   Whilst it will be the primary function of the proposed Corporations and their subsidiaries to undertake regularair line operation to fixed schedules, they will also be empowered to undertakecharter and taxi flying.    It is not proposed, however, to reserve this latterfield to the Corporations and it will be open to private operators to engage in charter and taxi operations, but they will be required to satisfy the safety regulations and to maintain satisfactory conditions- of employment, :29*     Private and Club Flying.  -   It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to encourage private and club flying and gliding, subject onlyto such restrictions as are necessary in the interests of safety.   Noticehas already been given that, by arrangement with the Secretary of State forAir, the Air Navigation (Restriction in Time of War) Order will berescinded on the 31st December, 1945.30.      In presenting the foregoing outline of their policy, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment believe that their proposals offer the surest means of laying the foundations of our civil aviation to ensure its progressive-, efficient and economical expansion in the public interest.    It is their aim to bring this form of travel within the reach of all, so that opportunities may be afforded to forge closer understanding and association among nations.    Theyconsider that to place the nation&apos;s civil air transport under public ownership and control offers the best prospects of securing a flourishingcivil air transport industry.11th.
