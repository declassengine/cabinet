PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1986 morandum by the Lord President of the Council

At their meetBl^^l7 July the Cabinet decided that the Public Expenditure SvM^^%hould be conducted within the published public expenditure plalfcSkotals of   144 billion for 1987-88 and   149 billion for 1988-89, and	a total of   153 billion for 1989-90, and invited

the Chief Secretary, Treasury to pursue bilateral discussion of expenditure programm^B  h the Ministers responsible on that basis. At their meeting on 2 0&lt;^5e^CC(86) 32.2) the need to reach agreement with the Chief Secretary, Treast^r was reinforced, and the Cabinet noted that a Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure (MISC 130) was being set up to discuss matters which could not be agreed between Departments and the Chief Secretary, Treasury and to make recommendations to the Cabinet.

2.	This memorandum reports on^^fcwork of the Group and sets out the recommendations of MISC 130. ifcj^like to express my gratitude both to the members of the Group and ^jBfcnding Ministers who have appeared before us for the care and thoroug   3  Jj7hich they have brought to the

3.	A large number of programmes were	in bilateral discussions

between the Chief Secretary, Treasury anJKl^pending Ministers concerned. The effects on the Survey bas^fl^^re set out in Annex A; brief descriptions of the policy implicati^p aA^in Annex B. MISC 130 were, however, left with eight programmes to.,con%der, inevitably the most difficult.

4.	Cabinet agreed on 17 July that discussions should be carried forward

within the existing published planning totals referred to above. These contained uncommitted Reserves of   6.1 billion,   7.9	and f9,6

billion respectively. However, the July decision of ftmM^-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure of the Ministerial SteerinfRommittee on Economic Strategy, on local authority current provision m ^87-88, together with the implications for the territories, added^ggj^^p.4 billion to the previous total, using up more than half themjaW^ble 1987-88 Reserve. The subsequent agreement with the Ministe^ t^^kerned to base provision for the two later years on i per cent real Tean^tmuBin local authority current spending also required additions to pr^^Hk of   4.3 billion and   5.1 billion in 1988-89 and 1989-90 respectively*In addition to these amounts it was necessary to allow for increases


   billion,   0.7 billion and   1.1 billion respectively over the three years ) to take * account of the agreements reached bilaterally by the Chief ^Secretary, Treasury.

JEjL As a consequence of these changes, the Group were faced with the ^^^ion summarised in the following table at the beginning of their work:

   billion

AGREED PROGRAMMES

6.	I am glad to repor^RWt the Group have reached agreement on all programmes and made significant progress towards removing the outstanding excesses. Of total outstanding bids of   3.1 billion,   2.9 billion and   4.8 billion in the three years on the programmes described below, the Group have agreed reductions of   0.7 bi^H.on,   0.7 billion and   1.3 billion, leaving additions of   2.4 billim^^.2 billion and   3.5 billion, of which previously agreed demand-led ch^jyges^yid changes in administration costs on the social security programme ac^MWy&gt;r some   1.6 billion,   1.7 billion and   2.6 billion. On the basis o^J^^idence presented to them the Group did not consider it practicable, in nja^^kases from a political point of view, to seek reductions in programme^b^gknd this.

7.	The proposals on the agreed programiJJi^ summarised in paragraphs 8 to 16 below. All figures are in    millior^P^tes otherwise stated.

Defence

8.	The Survey baseline is as follows:

18,817	18,990	19,268

Changes agreed outside the Group   s discussions, inclu  j^^ntrrbutions to the cost of advancing the second Auxiliary Oiler Replelfement Vessel, are:

- 23	+ 26	^j|0

The Secretary of State for Defence had proposed the following ffl^jier additions to baseline:

+ 131	+ 136	+ 432


   The Chief Secretary, Treasury sought reductions below baseline of   300 million in each year.

k The Group agreed to recommend the following further changes to baseline, faking account of the latest estimate of Falkland Islands costs, which it Disagreed will in future be subsumed within the baseline.

0	- 33	+ 157

The Group have not been able to reach agreement on the cost of advancing the minehunter programme.

Electri&lt;^^^

9.	The^sujrVMt baseline is as follows:

- F,685	- 1,281	- 1,313

The Secretary	for Energy had proposed the following additions to

baseline:

+ 450	+ 171	+ 427

The Chief Secretary, treasury was prepared to accept additions of   100 million and   50 million in the first two years, but sought a reduction of -   150 million below baseline in the last year. After discussion with the Group and with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Secretary of State for Energy has agreed to reduce	above baseline by   70 million,   80

million and   397 million resp^MJ^y, leaving additions to baseline of:

The Secretary of State for Energy	it clear that the large

reduction in the final year must in t*i^^kew be regarded as without commitment and subject to revision in JK^ight of negotiations with the industry in due course. The Group are pr  H^ed to accept the External Financing Limits now proposed, but they	that further planning

should be on the basis that the financial targ% for the period after 1987-88 is assumed to be an average real r^e of return on net assets of 3.75 per cent in the years 1988-89 and 1989-90. (For the three years up to 1987-88 a target of 2.75 per cent has already been set.) The Group believe that 3.75 per cent is a reasonable target to aim at, and that it would be right for the Government to press strongly for it to^i^ agreed m time for it to be taken into account in the 1987 Survey. ThAm^erefore recommend the above figures on that basis.

Overseas Development Administration

10.	MISC 130 and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary ^^ivA%|reed to recommend the following increase in the baseline provision^or fee -overall programme:

+ 5	+8	+15


   This will maintain the net aid programme constant in real terms during the I Survey period.

% ^alth and Personal Social Services

The Survey baseline (excluding local authority current expenditure) is as follows:

15,937	16,617	17,032

The Secretary of State for Social Services sought additions of:

+ 408	+ 772

Following ^fec||kions with the Group, and taking account of bids of   191 million,   2()in2^on and   561 million for demographic growth and demand-determflS^%rvice (eg Family Practitioner Services) already agreed by the Chief	Treasury, the Secretary of State for Social

Servcies has agre^Bk accept the following additions to the baseline:

+ 309	+ 289	+ 683

This will allow an incr^aJ^of 2.2 per cent in real terms on hospital and community health services current spending in 1987-88, and 1 per cent in each of the two following years. The Group recommend these figures.

Social Security

12.	The Survey baseline is as

44, 197	46,758

are very large additions as a	the effect of higher

estimates of take-up of benefits and r^iQl economic assumptions. In addition the Chief Secretary, TreasuryT|S jL^epted further revisions for increased administration costs and other	changes. The combined

effect of these was to add the following n*^i^mts to the above baseline:

+ 1,585	+ 1,734	+ 2,605

In addition to this the Secretary of State for Social Services proposed further additions of   45 million,   35 million and   11 million, whereas the Chief Secretary, Treasury sought reductions of:	A

- 150	- 300	- 550

13.	After a very careful and detailed examination of th^^options for further savings, the Group, with the agreement of the Secr^Ui^^f State for Social Services, recommend the following changes:

+35	- 100	- 250 m


   The savings in the later years will be achieved by a variety of policy

i changes which the Secretary of State for Social Services will be

konsidering further with the Chief Secretary, Treasury. Some of them will P^uire primary legislation, which will need to be introduced in November jifcDecember 1987, or very early in 1988. The Group accept that the ^HfeaLtary of State for Social Services should retain some flexibility over the prtecise measures, and commend the above reductions on this basis.

Arts and Libraries

14.	The Minister of State, Privy Council Office (Minister for the Arts) sought subst^tial additions to his programme (  20 million,   29 million and   35 millio^^mthe three years respectively) in part to provide for overruns	expenditure on the British Library St Pancras project,

and in part SflDLe Arts Council and for national museums and galleries. MISC 130 are aEyseflaed at the escalation of the British Library costs and agreed with thej^i* Secretary, Treasury that further study is required before decisions^fcj^ taken. These bids have therefore been withdrawn and the position dl^Obe reviewed in the light of the above study. MISC 130 have agreed the^^3^^wing additions to the baseline provisions, with the Minister of Stat^, Pnty Council Office:

+ 7	+7	+8

Wales

15.	In addition to formula conse^^entials on central Government and local authority capital programmes agi  ^^^-n England, the Secretary of State for Wales sought the full formula c^j^lkntials for the increase in local authority current expenditure in Bnglanjl resulting from the Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement. This exce^pa^j^ amounts agreed for local authority current provision in Wales by:^

+ 95	+ 97	+ 98

MISC 130 took the view that it would not	to provide these full

consequentials which would be devoted to tl^^SeJ^tary of State for Wales s other programmes. After discussion with the &lt;urou^ the Secretary of State for Wales agreed to surrender resources of   25 million,   27 million and   28 million in the three years respectively.   8 million of this in each year reflects an adjustment to the baseline to reflect the change in population ratios since 1979.

Scotland

16.	In addition to formula consequentials on central G^Eft^^t and local authority capital programmes agreed in England, the Secretary Wt State for Scotland sought the full formula consequentials for the in&lt;^a  ^n local authority current expenditure in England from the RSG settleme^^M This exceeded the amounts agreed for local authority current provis^^^Qi^^


   Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland also sought additional i provision for regional and industrial expenditure. These sums totalled:

w

%	+ 107	+ 76	+ 91

the case of Wales, MISC 130 took the view that it would not be right ^k&gt;vide either these full consequentials or the extra provision for r^df^al and industrial assistance. After discussion with the Group the Secretary of State for Scotland agreed to reduce the additional sums he s ough t to:

+10	+9	+ 8.5

Part of tA*   s foregone reflects the need to take some account of the change in pHgdkion ratios since 1979.

OVERALL POSI&apos;OW^^k

17.	Parallel	Group&apos; s discussions, the Cabinet agreed on 30

October to substantjl^^dditions for teachers&apos; pay. Thus the overall position at the	of the Group&apos;s work is as follows:

&apos;&gt;	   billion

1987-88	1988-89	1989-90

Local Authority current:	3.4	4.3	5.1

Teachers&apos; Pay:	^	...	...

Agreements reached bilateral^^^j^^	1.1	0.7	1.1

Demand-led and other Social Sec^td^^

Changes:	1.6	1.7	2.6

Additions recommended by MISC 130:	0.5	0.9

------------------------------- -----------------------------------

Total additions to Programmes:	8.1	10.6

(compared with starting Reserves of:) 6.1	7.9	9.6

(Note:	Figures may not sum due to rounding.)

The Group understand that the Chancellor of the Excheq^j^^ktends to consider and recommend to the Cabinet to what extent th^Reserves need to be reconstituted in the light of the above outcome.

   RECOMMENDATIONS

S^8. I invite the Cabinet to endorse the agreements reached, as summarised ^3in paragraphs 6 to 16 above.

1.	Diplomatic Wing	+40	+37	+36

Provi	made for the costs of introducing the new visa regime

(largely^^fr set by increased fees in later years)/ for increased expenditure on security, and for increased overseas costs.

2.	EC Contribufikons	-280	-510	+85

   

This reflects	re-estimation of contributions to the

European Communiti^rT^ The drop in payments in 1988-89 mainly reflects an assumed ^lar4e correction to the UK&apos;s 1987 abatement during 1988.

Qi, i

The additions largely reflect increased spending on gi^^gtrial

R&amp;D and support for the Cornish tin industry, partly	in

the first year by receipts from sales from the strategic ^^eral

stockpile. As agreed in last year&apos;s Survey, provision contl^m^

to be made for a further moratorium on regional development grant

payments; this will probably be announced and take effect when

the Public Expenditure White Paper is published in January 1987.

   ECGD	-60	-18	-84

The net reductions reflect latest estimates of the cost of the i^ilfcst support programme.

8. ^MLrgy	-43	-42	-55

The agrefl^^t reflects reduced requirements on the departmental programme; and an agreement that the electricity industry should take over from the department some responsibility for financing the UKAEA&apos;s fast reactor programme, representing a switch of   30 million a year ra e industry&apos;s external financing limits.

9.	Employment	0	0	0

This programme was se^.1at baseline (which includes the effects of the 1986 Budget mea^HB^) in advance of the 17 July Cabinet. Provision includes addi^^M^l. expenditure, notably under the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, offset by savings elsewhere especially on the Community Programme and Youth Training Scheme.

10.	Transport	+76	+88	+88

&apos;A

Additional provision has been made ^^^koads, mainly to sustain road building by local authorities. Camt^ allocations to local authorities in 1987-88 will be at 95% of t^^^^^86-87 level.

11.	Housing	+264	+14	+14

Net additional provision of   239 million has been agreed for capital spending on housing in 1987-88. (The balance reAA&amp;s increased costs of housing subsidies.) In addition, extra	receipts

will yield some   950 million over the three years. T^se ^lcreases will enable the Government fully to meet the commi^|^|k given to local authorities that allocations in 1987-88 would	less

than 80 per cent of the 1985-86 level, and will provide 0fcra resources for the renovation of the housing stock (esp^^J^r through the Urban Housing Renewal Unit) and for grants to housing associations.


   ^^2. DOE Other	+ 7 0	+13	0

r   #XtJr.a provision has been agreed for capital spending on local ^^P^nmental services in 1987-88 which will fully meet the 80 per ce^fc! commitment. Extra receipts from the New Towns totalling flOO^Ji^^ion over the three years will be available to finance additilfliS^spending on these services and on other environmental program&apos;s. ^Expenditure arising from the designation of new urban development corporations will be met, as agreed in E(A) on 24 September, from within the new baseline.

14.	Home Office	+62	+46	+73

Additional provision is planned to cover growing pressures on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, and for capital expenditure by Fire Joint Boards .^^^Hb^tra provision is also made for design work on further new ^jJSftns, raising the building programme to 20 in all, and for a	modest law and order

initiatives, partly offset by savings anf^J^-tional receipts.

15.	Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department	+71	+110

Additional provision is made for further growth in the cost of legal aid, and for extra staff to man the expanding court service (the latter partly offset by fees).

16.	Education and Science	+162

The main elements of the additional provision are for uri^^k^^^ties (  61 million rising to   81 million); science (  24 million in^H^-88 and   20 million a year thereafter); local authority capit^ i  57 million a year extra provision, enabling 1987-88 allocatioire to be maintained at their 1986   87 level); voluntary schools capital (an average of   8 million a year) ; and the new City Technological Colleges (  4 million rising tn f,ll million).

(excluding LAPR/MIRAS)

Allowance is made for additional stS^Aad information technology in the Revenue Departments to deal wJjRiincreases in work load and to strengthen controls against dru^D|^^ggling.   24 million is provided in 1989-90 to meet the cost of t^he European elections.

24. ^^^^lalised Industries	+300	+284	-59

The ^forindividual industries involve changes from baseline of:

LONDON REGIONAL TRANSPORT	-52	-100

BRITISH AIRPORTS AUTHORITY)	^ff/+10	-30	0

NATIONAL BUS COMPANY	)

The main implications of Survey decisions for the nationalised industries are:

British Coal:	The increases over plans reflect aireappraisal of

BC&apos; s prospects following the coal strike and oil p^k^^^|all, and the need to adjust their activities accordingly. The ^FLp^Dresume break even in 1988-89. They also allow for transf er^J^BC of responsibility for miners&apos; redundancy costs from 1987-88.

Scottish Electricity Boards:	Increases for the South of Scotland

Electricity Board arise partly because of slippage on Torness and on other capital requirements.


   w

British Steel:	The figures reflect BSC&apos;s return to profitability,

\Bj^t make some allowance for the deregulation of the European steel ^m^cet.

Post Office:	The capital expenditure provision is substantially

high  K|;%. all three years. Profits are in line with the 5% required

British Rail:	The provision reflects the recently announced

objectives for public service grant and for continued substantial investment. &amp;

Water:	The settl^M^^ implies tariff increases probably averaging

about 2-2*5% in realjieMis and further efficiency savings to maintain the present substant^gjf^vel of investment in the industry.

London Regional Transpoi%^^ The substantial reductions reflect continuing buoyant reven^r^together with further improvements in efficiency.

British Airports Authority)

National Bus Company	):	The\J^^owance shown covers these

industries&apos; external finance needs	the time of privatisation.

Cl

25. Redundancy and Pensions Funds ^k%-66	-101	-145

Reductions in provision for redundancy/pe^funds reflect higher than expected take-up under the Redundan^^Mneworkers Payments Scheme this year and, in consequence, reduced requirements for the Survey years. They also allow for transfer to BC of responsibility for miners&apos; redundancy costs from 1987-&amp;8.
