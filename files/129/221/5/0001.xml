Chapter 1: u^duction

The Nature of	i.xrflk ry health care services are in the front line of the NHS. They are the

Primary Health services^^dad outside hospitals by family doctors, dentists, retail pharmacists Care	and optiOTOTjmMe four professions make up the family practitioner services) and

by commurfcu^rarses, midwives, health visitors and other professions allied to medicine (the^mmunity health services). Each year most people make use of one or other of the primary health care services. In round numbers 650,000 people are seen by their family doctor on any working day and about the same number get prescription medicines^wih their local retail pharmacist. Nearly 300,000 go to the dentist; at least 1 OO.CXMareffiited by nurses or other health professionals working in the community; 50,0DCbwlinlsl community health clinics; and 30,000 go for a sight test. Extensive use oSjhegpryices is made by people in good health who require advice or screening amMu by those suffering from illness. They account for 90 per cent of all contacts wMj&amp;NHS; and they account for over 30 per cent of the gross expenditure on the1eiflQ&gt;  ^vice in the UK. The current annual gross expenditure on these services in the UK&amp;over   5 billion.

2.	These figures indicate the extent	of primary health care that is

provided under the National Health Sen^k^ addition there is the health care which people obtain outside the NHS, i^nraHftby treating themselves but sometimes by making use of private practide^jeteare some signs of development in private primary health care but for the forts  6apl$Kfuture most people are likely to continue to look to the NHS for the majoritM^wOra care.

3.	Primary health care services are more fully de^gaS3)n the United Kingdom than in most other countries, where patients have moK^ojrefct access to specialist care and rely less on general practitioner and commurmjraealth services.1 Our | services are generally provided to a high standard and arowell appreciated by the public. The Government considers that British primary care arrangements have made an important contribution to both the quality and cost-effectiveness of our health care system, and this view is widely held both by commenfzforain this country and abroad.

The Need for 4. Over the last 6 Vi years the Government has given priority to the aaflpriSlent Review	of the National Health Service. Since 1979, the Government has directia^x^*

significantly more resources to the Hospital and Community Health SerwKS/VV while health authorities have made increasingly better use of scarce resouiwsNfrjo result is that in England alone the annual number of in-patient cases has riseroj^^v over 3A million; at the same time 57 major hospital building projects have beer\\_y/ started as part of a massive capital programme amounting to more than   1 billioiC^ The number of mentally ill and mentally handicapped patients resident in hospital^ has continued to decline as the policy of providing support for people in more &lt; appropriate settings has been backed with a significant increase in the level of spending on all services for these patients and clients. Above all there has been a fundamental change in the management of the services so that now general managers have been appointed to ensure the best possible services to patients within available resources. ___________

5.	At the same tim*j4mprovements have been made in the primary care field. In -England and Wawiith^e include:

Other improvements extending thiftm^oilit the United Kingdom include.

unncessary spending on expenshas been reduced by the introduction of a selected list of m^afein^in certain categories;

consumer choice has been increased by^wia^the restrictive opticians monopoly over the sale and dispensing ofraro^and glasses, with a marked fall in their price and the introduction of ne^ranges of budget-priced frames;	&apos;v

funds have been allocated to improve primary care in inner cities.

6.	Our primary health care services are good but could beil  eSw|still. The Government believes there is scope for improving the qualHiSHPPeguveness,an&lt;^ value for money which patients and the nation get from them/Th^nrimary health

7.	Much health care depends on co-operation and teamwork. Consideratioirof^^ primary health care inevitably raises questions about the boundaries betweeni^^j different professions involved. Are we making the best use of pharmacists? Anu

are we realising the full potential of nurses? Can family doctors be helped to makfe&apos;&apos;. more effective use of their particular skills and knowledge? These questions need to be widely discussed and the Government hopes that a constructive debate will take place about these and the other issues raised in this paper.

The Family vT^ajamily practitioner services are provided by independent professional people Practitioner	&apos;^wfoapntract individually with the Government to provide their services to

Services	j  idnfeyThis is in contrast with the hospital service, where members of the same

professions - doctors, pharmacists, dentists and opticians     are salaried empiojwfefhealth authorities. In some ways, the individuals contracting to proviactawfypractitioner services are like 66,000 small businesses, although in their job	and pension arrangements, they are more like salaried

employeesS^mis system has brought a number of benefits over the years and the GovemmenMoes not intend to depart from it. It does mean, though, that the ways in which the Government discharges its responsibility to the public to provide a comprehensive and^ffkient service are quite different from those by which it ensures a proper an/reffMtive use of resources by health authorities, who operate within a framework\lfcca  MKnits, priorities, Ministerial guidelines and accountability upward/witly delegation downwards. The FPS are also different in not being provided largeiy^major institutions in which professional performance can more reamVwraidged by others. The result of the contractual nature of the relationship wiMttjumy practitioners and of the organisation of primary health care services is thartfj&amp;mdividual members of the public as the recipients of the services are oftefttraterplaced to judge the quality of delivery of services than the NHS bodies respiohsiM^for them. There is therefore considerable emphasis in this paper on ways of enaIriH&amp;$e patient to exercise an informed choice in using the services.

9.	The Government believes that consideratipnfothe family practitioner services should have the following purposes in mind; //v.

to give patients the widest range of choice jj^Dtakiing high quality primary health care services;

to encourage the providers of services to aim fosfme highest standards and to be responsive to the needs of the public;	v

to provide the taxpayer with the best value for money from NHS expenditure on the family practitioner services;

to enable clearer priorities to be set for the family practitK^i&amp;Fdces in relation to the rest of the NHS.	(\~s)

10.	The Government is determined to ensure that the public receives^&amp;rin&amp;iest possible level of family practitioner services. The interests of the pubUrcrc&amp;Sk paramount concern. The convenience and comfort of patients should b^regraed as an important part of the standard of care which they receive Within sensjb  x\ limits of cost, they are entitled to choose who they are treated by and where

to be treated. They are entitled to know what services are available for them. are entitled to have complaints dealt with properly when they consider that the vTv services let them down. The central aim of this document is to seek ways of &apos;c/ improving the family practitioner services for the public The Government believes &gt; that the professions providing the services will themselves wish to do so in ways that meet public and individual needs while meeting their own professional standards.

   2: Primary Health Care Today

Introdrfrtmr^ 1. Many factors influence the health of the population. General economic and social conditions affect the opportunity to obtain adequate food and shelter.

Public and environmental health measures help to reduce or eliminate common &lt;^^^dsks by, for instance, safeguarding the quality of public water supplies.

M^Jmdividuals and families have major responsibilities for their own health in, for &apos;&apos;^^xahaple, diet, exercise and road safety. When, however, people need professional maintain or improve their health it is important that the services they delivered as conveniently and acceptably as possible, as well as that thegp  epttres are effective.

Size of the Family 2. The scale of family practitioner services is large and has bemgroUjjig, in some Practitioner	cases considerably. The number of doctors in the UK who havecomraCwd to

Services	provide general medical services has risen from 26,345 in 1979 to 2Vy3^gW984, an

increase of 11 per cent. There are over 225 million consultations with&quot;^^^A&gt;% doctors each a year. The cost of these services was about   1.2 billion in 1984-85; while the cost of supplying medicines on prescription under the4aft  wL practitioner services in the UK in 1984-85 was over   1.9 billion. The cost of supplying medicines on prescription has risen by 28 per cent in real terms ov  V^/) fiwyeare.

3.	The number of dentists in the family practitioner services in the UK in 1984-85&apos;\&gt;&apos;0 was 16,472 an increase of some 2^00 over five years. These dentists provided some 36 Vi million courses of treatment in that year at a gross cost of about   750	vO

million. In addition, the equivalent of about 1,740 dentists are employed full-time	O&apos;

in the community dental services under which the teeth of over six million school	0

children were inspected and over 1.4 million school children had dental treatment.	^


   (16,477)


   4.	The number of opticians in contract to provide general optical services rose by 11 per cent in the five years to 1984-85 to a total of 8,678. Over the same period there has been a slight rise in the number of retail pharmacies in the UK from .	11,034 to 11,508, an increase of just over 4 per cent, though numbers are at present

growing faster.

Access taC&amp;eQms 5. Except in the case of an emergency, where any NHS general practitioner is required to provide all immediately necessary treatment, a patient must be registered with a family doctor to get general medical treatment under the xr^/lS^ational Health Service. Anyone can apply to the doctor of his choice in the area ^^wiich he lives for acceptance as a National Health Service patient. If the doctor him, a simple registration form is completed and sent to the local Family TyffiiWhner Committee or Health Board, which adds his name to the doctor   s list orreg&amp;twi patients. Registration is necessary because once a patient is on a docrorisjjs^the doctor has a continuing contractual responsibility for his medical needs ^^dtlmfeturn receives an annual fee, irrespective of whether or not the patient n^ivKpseelc treatment

6.	Ninety-aren per cent of people are registered with a family doctor and rarely change to another unless they move to another area. No one needs to be left without a doctor because Family Practitioner Committees and Health Boards have powers to allocat^tatients who are experiencing difficulty in registering to a doctor   s list. (/_ v

7.	Unlike family doctoi&amp;clejHists do not have a continuing responsibility for their patients once a particulof treatment is completed and are paid only according to the treatmenWim^toyide. There is, therefore, no need for formal     registration with a dentist, aiiraf^Kin need of dental treatment are free to obtain it from any dentist willing to a  em  pMn as patients. A dentists who accepts a patient for National Health Serv^^jafcment is required to provide that patient with all the treatment that is necesOT^Q^cure dental fitness. Some dentists, however, are not willing to accept apM^t^r a course of treatment which involves the provision of certain items/forcx^nple dentures or crowns, which they will only provide privately. Family Pracu&amp;min^ommittees and Health Boards have a responsibility for helping people to ^poa^ntist but cannot, as they can with family doctors, require dentists to treat ^JafSmlar patient.

8.	Patients obtain most of the medicines and araliajs%s they need by taking a doctor   s prescription to any chemist   s shop whereINraajwacist dispenses it. In some rural areas doctors dispense the medicines th&amp;rirescribe for patients who live some distance from their nearest chemist. Some medicines, however, do not require a prescription and can be bought over the counter at chemists: others are available in shops and stores.

9.	People who wish to have their sight tested can go to any opnfna^ic optician or ophthalmic medical practitioner who is required to give them a^jresfTistion if they need glasses. Under the new arrangements for supplying glasses mpstMgple are then free to take their prescription to any shop where glasses are on&apos;sgi^md choose the best buy. Children and those entitled to National Health SOTpCT$tasses must, however, go to the registered suppliers.

Paying for	10. Family practitioner services are mainly paid for from taxes. Of the totaC^^^\

services	expenditure on family practitioner services in the United Kingdom of over

  4 billion in 1984-85 the users paid less than 10 per cent in patient charges. Abo\tf&gt;&lt;^\&gt;   145 million was paid in prescription charges;   195 million in dental charges; ano\&gt;^7 about   52 million in optical charges. Thus over 90 per cent of the expenditure was ^   A paid for from taxes and NHS contributions and the effective and efficient	^

working of family practitioner services is therefore of interest to everyone however	v

much or little they need to call upon these services.

11.	The members of the professions who^^tmd; to provide family practitioner

services are paid under terms that are negotja*    wntrally between their professions and the Government. In all fourlieujjpe^the professions remuneration systems are based on the princiiWfof^ibst plus   , that is, payments cover both contractors    expenses in providing	and their remuneration

for doing so. Most fees and allowances are paid toramupners at standard rata regardless of their individual expenses. This arrangemwnis important because it provide an inducement to the practitioner to run his pl^ptice with proper regard for cost-effectiveness and thus avoids the need for instrusive examination of the levels of expenses incurred. (There are three main exceptions tothis^ general medical practitioners are reimbused individually for the cost oflirc^\prernises and for the major part of their expenditure on ancillary help, in bon^aggs^wthin laid-down rules. And pharmacists and dispensing doctors are repaiaT^Bv^yally for the drugs they supply.) The remuneration element of practitionersXijgjgJft is determined on the advice of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body2	^

those two professions and by negotiation (and where necessary indepe^ootyX^ advice) in the case of pharmacists and opticians. A more detailed descnptfowd^ the remuneration systems for the four services is given in Appendix 2.

12.	The remuneration system for family doctors is extremely complicated.

Government believes there may be scope to restructure these arrangements to

better account of the interests of patients by providing better incentives to doctora\&gt;W to improve services and to make it fairer to individual doctors by providing a level of remuneration which more accurately reflects differing workloads and commitments, this is discussed further in Chapter 3.	^

1 The independent Review Body on Doctors    and Dentists&apos; Remuneration was appointed in 1971 to advise the Prime Minister on the remuneration of doctors and dentists taking any part in the National Health Service.

13 Unlike doctors, the incomes of individual dentists (with the exception of a ^	small number of salaried dentists and older dentists in receipt of seniority

payments) entirely depend on the number of particular services they provide and their efficiency at doing so. A pilot study of a different system of paying dentists ^O^Yfor treating children is described in Chapter 4.

1985 the Government reached agreement with the pharmaceutical ^Gfcta&amp;sion on a new contract for paying for the NHS work of retail pharmacists.

&apos;^Mjfoauld improve incentives to efficiency by replacing the flate rate element of pwprein&apos;in the old contract by remuneration related to the volume of work done.

In addmSKkthe arrangements for determining total costs will be improved to the benenLk^miif the taxpayer and the profession. Legislation is needed to introduce the new^ijmract in full. A suitable Bill is now before Parliament. More details of these imprwojiehts are given in Chapter 5.

15. The mos&amp;ar-reaching changes to the relationship between the NHS and one of the family practitioner services are those relating to general optical services. As explained in Chapter 6, the Government is moving towards a system where those entitled to glasses undjirtbe NHS will receive a cash voucher instead so that they may take advantage Wth&amp;Wer choice now existing in the private sector. However the arrangements undS^fiOTt sight tests are provided free to patients within the NHS by the payment of^^c^tra rate negotiated between the Government and the profession remain.	  &apos;JL/O

Administrative 16. The scope and objectives dHlvbjtonary health care services, the systems of Arrangements remuneration and terms and conc^hraj^Qf service for doctors, dentists, opticians and community nurses are broadlyMmiM&apos; throughout the UK. In the case of pharmacists there are separate Scotu^Mm^Northem Irish negotiating arrangements but these are in effect cdmrauple with those in England and Wales.

The most significant difference betweetf^mK concerns the responsibility for the administration of family practitioner semew\

17.	In England and Wales, NHS arrangement^t^rofessional practices are managed by Family Practitioner Committees (FffigSjjwhich the Government has established from 1985 as authorities in their ownMjtpFPCs are now autonomous authorities whose Chairman and members     usuallya^iriy members together with 15 from the four family practitioner services     are appointed by the Secretary of State for Social Services or Secretary of State for Wales: This gives them a stronger and more independent base and enables them to have a higher profile than most have adopted in the past. There are 90 FPCs in England and eigljCBt Wales.

18.	FPCs have two essential roles: administering the contractS^mfrfamily

practitioners and planning the development of the services in thei/areayFPCs need to keep the public informed of their activities and plans and	of the

public will be important in assessing the quality and standards of thewwj^sfbr which they are responsible. All FPCs have been sked to draw up a profifegjffjw^ services in their area as a first step in a systematic approach to the identiniawmjrf needs and priorities.	^//V\

19.	To assist and encourage FPCs to achieve high standards in the managemeq  raX\

the resources for which they are responsible and in the development of positive planning, the DHSS and Welsh Office have introduced a system for reviewing the^&gt; performance of each FPC, bringing to bear on FPCs the principles of sensible	/

financial management. To help FPCs identify the scope for improvements the Departments have worked with them to produce performance indicators, enabling comparisons to be made between similar FPCs. The progressive computerisation

of FPCs will also help to improve their efficiency and performance.

20.	In Scoflamd, responsibility for the administration of the services is undertaken by 15 HealtlrBoards and the Common Services Agency. Health Boards were established in 1974 and their members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland; each Boardi*at responsibility for hospital, community and primary care services in its area.

Private Health 24. Althojfefujje main expenditure on primary health care is met through the

Care	NHS, thisTrarit the only route-providing such care. Some, although a very small

proportion?   patients obtain general medical services as private patients. There have been a number of interesting developments in the provision of primary care by the private sector-far example the provision of health maintenance and check-up programmjC^Swsrivate companies, and the introduction in at least one area of a full primary^ajth^are service by doctors operating in the private sector.

There is a fair amount of/fJrrrate dental practice The Government hopes that private primary care scmo^lll develop in ways that provide both an alternative source of care and also a mWjSepcomparing NHS services with those provided under quite different arrangeta^vSThere is merit in diversity and one advantage of the contractor system in th^feMl^practitioner services - under which doctors and other practitioners receive pagmm&amp;br their practice expenses as well as for their remuneration     is the relative^^^njh which it is possible to contemplate the Health Service entering into contra^^^arrangements with different types of health care providers. In the first placi^Amtam be sensible to proceed by experimenting in one or two limited area^^i^wKable private health care organisations were interested they could be^jjvlfwrc) tender to provide integrated primary care services under the Health Serviqg^OTjHD more than the cost to the NHS under normal arrangements, in the same wa^nat individual practitioners do.

25.	The development of integrated schemes offenh^Kelull range of primary health care services is currently inhibited by regulatKur^breventing anyone other than a dentist or doctor from running a dental busine^for profit. There are no similar rules in relation to other primary care professions, and provided there are safeguards for professional standards its removal may open the way to new schemes such as one stop health care shops which could be of considerable advantage to patients.	\C_

Changing Patterns 26. The boundary between primary health care and the hospital s^oaCgs-is never

At the same time other medical advances have made possible to care for patients in their homes who previously needed to be treatdim^^. hospital. Thus management of patients with duodenal ulcers has been revolutionised by the introduction of new medicines, significantly reducing the j need for surgical treatment in hospital. In some conditions, as in diabetes, high. blood pressure and in ante-natal and post-natal care both primary care and	.

hospital services have an important role to play. Patients have also benefited from the trend in recent years to care for a greater proportion of the elderly, the mentally ill and mentally handicapped in the community.

27.	The content of primai^ftKMOT&gt;rare and the balance between its component

parts have inevitably been anj^&amp;nfcy these trends. The move towards the provision of care in the communuy^^been assisted by the increasing involvement of a wider range of romiesabnal groups who with appropriate training are participating in the pnrogty^roalth care team and by increases in the numbers of support staff. For examp^i^te; psychiatric field, the development of community psychiatric nurses and a newmtokst among consultants in community psychiatry has made it possiMffwie^iE for many more patients without admission to hospital. In the five	the number of ancillary

Conditions which once led to protracted ilmi&amp;Zopdisability, such as pneumoconiosis and chronic bronchitis are fewer,       reinfections have largely yielded to antibiotics. Social changes including widespprad car ownership have reduced the burden of home visiting. These changes and the steady rise in the number of general practitioners and consequent fall in list sizes have meant that the average number of home visits carried out by each doctor f^Fb^vseven per cent in the five years to 1984, while the average number of all consn^ioosiat home and in the surgery) per doctor fell by two per cent.

28.	These trends are likely to continue. At the same time, technolotegfr? developments are likely to create new possibilities for change. The incra&amp;HH&amp;\ availability of diagnostic kits will enable many tests to be done in the d0^0tf&amp; surgery rather than in the hospital laboratory. The growth in self-testing devp^y for example for heart rate, blood pressure and intestinal bleeding, coupled v&amp;fry) increasing health awareness, are likely to provoke a demand for confirmatoiyfeVt/ The management of chronic diseases may be made more effective by the increasing availability of technical aids, such as personal continuous-infusion pumps for insulin and blood sugar monitors for diabetes. Discussion of primary ^ health care services therefore needs constantly to question whether there are new opportunities for the management of health care.

   (^P^iter 3: The General Medical Services

Intrdirawtan	1. General practitioners - family doctors - have long been a key element in the

delivery of health care in the UK. In this country almost everyone in need of medical treatment goes first to a family doctor rather than to a specialist in a

fteld of medicine: The continuity of care which they provide for people ^^y)on their lists, and their ability to arrange for patients to receive the most ^-^veopropriate form of specialist treatment are hallmarks of our system. In no other NV^^reloped country has the primary care physician achieved such a central role.

^Q^&amp;reral practitioners have the advantage of seeing the patient   s problems in the odmop^f the patient   s wider lifestyle and usually with considerable knowledge of th^mejjjpd, family and social history of the patient. They should therefore be well plac  tf    CHB^mote actively good health among patients and to mobilise where necessai&amp;Ke^iost appropriate forms of community care. Patients also see the family dwjtpi&apos;as a source of advice on a wide range of other aspects of their lives that closelXJffect their health and well-being. Effective handling of the problems, whether medical or social, that patients bring to their family doctor have a significant impact on the use of resources.

3.	In the 1960s the/pne^l practitioner   s contract with the NHS was re-negotiated following the TamxjEPjjnjar   s Charter   , a document that the profession had drawn up in response wwiaKpread dissatisfaction among doctors. The result was a restructuring of the renwSrfemtion system with the intention, among other things, of providing various incenfwps^^better standards. The main objectives were to achieve improvements in sur^&amp;ra^mises, to enable doctors to employ more ancillary staff and to encouragejSrafo.practice. The result is that today over 90% of family doctors in the UK woram^jractices employing some ancillary staff. Many doctors employ practice ndQ^^p-have health authority nurses working in close association with them enablin^^Mpictice to provide a wider and more flexible range of therapeutic and piwsm&amp;g&amp;rvices, and helping doctors to concentrate on activities where medical^wj^fce essential. Many doctors now practise from purpose built accommodatrafarakhe Government is now spending approaching   80 million a year on premises ^OTgpnEral practice. Over three quarters of the general practitioners in the UK&lt;|ra    ractice in groups.

4.	Another landmark in the development of general practice w^^he^gtroduction in 1981 of a compulsory three year vocational training for new ent^t^Tus was a crucial step in maintaining and improving standards of care by spex&amp;d&amp;Kw training. General practice is a specialty in its own right and is increasiRgwraQas an attractive career by many of our best medical students. The new genoizpron^f vocationally trained doctors are better equipped to tackle the present day   neeilwji health care delivery.

5.	These changes apart, the most significant long-term trend has been a fall ir number of patients each doctor looks after. In the decade to 1984 the average vT^ number of patients on a doctor   s list fell by over 12 per cent to around 2000 and

the Government expects to see a further fall. Despite increases in the number of elderly people the number of patients aged 65 and over on the average doctor   s list has fallen slightly in the same period.

Public satist^jWj^. Most people appear to be satisfied with the quality of care they receive.

vO^pvertheless in spite of falls in doctors    list sizes and increases in ancillary help vxffi6 m sti1.1 criticisms from patients, particularly about the time it could take to v^^kappointment with a doctor, and long waiting times on arrival for ipmjrogients. This is happening at a time of rising expectations in all sections of th    6m#punity, and at a time when people generally feel that they should have a great6gig&amp;*&gt;t0 participate in the decisions that intimately affect them. They want t0 be ^|R  9}jPose the services they use on their own judgements of the quality and natiM&amp;jJf&apos;the services provided. Some doctors positively welcome this with its implicatioi^yf increasing their accountability to their patients.

7.	Despite the advances that have been and continue to be made in the provision of general medical services, some practices provide much higher standards of service in both medical and^rgwiisational terms than others. The Government&apos;s objective is to raise the genettu^Ojjy^of these services nearer to that of the best. This involves considerationwft^struaure of the present contract with general practitioners; the availabiM^io individuals of information about practices in a local area; the ways in whfdyra&amp;nts who are not fully satisfied with the care they have received can raise the pwrolfim^uid the way in which patients can select and change their doctor.

Encouraging good 8. The present structure of the coft^raAfias undoubtedly encouraged practice	improvements in general medical sen  &amp;  abce it was negotiated some 20 years

ago. But it is only right that the financi&amp;mj&amp;tives the system provides should be kept under review to see that they matchumwfl^current objectives. It is important to ensure that there are adequate rewards foT&apos;o^n^rs who provide improved services and proper incentives for others to raisestepdards of care. Many of those most closely concerned with general practice nq^acgmt that the incentives to reach high standards may be insufficient. Indeecf^fis^oK who attain them may find that they suffer financially compared with otmfrd&amp;ttors because of the relatively higher cost of providing such services. Fort^se reasons the Government believes that the payments system should be developed in order to recognise high standards quite explicitly, probably through the introduction of a&apos;good practice allowance/^s\

9.	This would be in line with views expressed within the medicatRKjIeSsion that better patient care can only be brought about by changes to the ejtiSpiAaTns of service and remuneration system which would lead to a much widdPSMme[income and more diverse patterns of service provision both within and with&lt;&amp;Mni&gt;pfHS.

The Royal College of General Practitioners has been active in this debatrararos recognised that what constitutes quality in primary medical care in the 1980&amp;f  k into the 1990s needs to be studied and discussed. Its recent publication    QufflipffiyN General Practice^ * sets out a number of suggestions about the components

good general practice and how these might be assessed and encouraged.

10.	Building on the College   s ideas it should be possible to identify reasonably objective criteria which could form the qualifying conditions for a significant part (y of the total payments to doctors. Entitlement to a good practice allowance might

be linked to such factors as:

1 Policy Statement 2, Quality in GenePTOraqiy


   personal availability to patients, both for surgery consultation and in terms ^	of out-of-hours cover;

the provision of a wide range of services, including preventive activities based on systems for identifying certain patients for periodic review;

V^f?ensurin8 ^at certain services, eg immunisation, have been provided for an ^^^greed proportion of patients in relevant categories;

ajtfsQdance at recognised post-graduate education courses.

In adcftkfjuasuch objective measures, if a good practice allowance is to be based on a re55  rf0Mvwide spread of those aspects of practice which are indicative of high qualiw^efk, provision would have to be made for some aspects of a doctor   s services to b&amp;ppropriately assessed, for example by other doctors. Similar arrangements already exist for approving training practices and are now an accepted part of general practice. The range of activities to be covered by such performance review wpnM need careful consideration, but it may be possible to include examinations cp such things as prescribing patterns and hospital referral rates.

11.	A particular feature of^emra^practice in some areas, especially in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland a  3prcates, is the relatively large number of small practices which are necessary wfwvffip appropriate services for people living in sparsely populated areas, for exaqaJ${Hi^ihe more remote parts of the Highlands and Islands. Some elements in theranunration system for doctors already recognise the different circumstance^o^Hwral practice in remote sparsely populated areas. It would be importaiittn^j^development of a good practice allowance that special provision was maq^Kfreftect these different circumstances.

Other aspects of	12. A large part of the remuneration received^kiokors is in the form of

the contract	allowances which may have served the purpose fo^wnich they were originally

designed-for example, the designated area allov(  Seef)md vocational training allowance. An incentive for vocational training is ndmnj^r appropriate when such training is now mandatory. There are now very few drancts designated by the Medical Practices Committee or the Scottish MedicarPractices Committee as having particular difficulty in attracting doctors and in which doctors can qualify for a designated area (or district allowance). Other changes to tjjMemuneration arrangements for doctors might also bring better value for mdroy^ame payments have little connection with the work done by doctors and havexbnjrtjtovregard for the doctor   s personal commitment to the provision of general medfcaliervices.

Some expenses are paid to doctors in a way which may include insurarant incentive to economy.

13.	Other aspects of the contract may also need to be re-negotiated incluwfig^rK~ proportion of a doctor   s remuneration represented by capitation fees. This currently about 45% of fees and allowances; this may not adequately recogn^  uv) extent to which work and responsibility vary with the number of patients. Nob*-^^ perhaps does it provide adequate incentive to doctors to practise in ways that wif(0^ encourage patients to join their lists. An increase in the total proportion of income^/ linked to the number of patients cared for (including a good practice allowance / also paid on a capitation basis) could overcome these difficulties.


   &amp;S&amp;

Ivy&apos;S. 14. Changes to the contract are ultimately matters for negotiation between the profession and the Government. But they are also relevant to the wider debate &gt;^\about the future development of services because of their impact upon the quality X^^&apos;Shf and range of care patients receive. The Government will decide what proposals &apos;^oraTnake to the profession in formal negotiations once full consultations have been    ^  mWeted. The profession   s representatives have indicated their readiness to \Jia number of topics covered in this chapter including, for example, the snoQK^wjnformation to patients discussed below.

Information about 15. U&amp;rae^to meet the Government   s objective of helping the patient to choose services	his docK^&amp;jSfoecessary to supply the public with information about the different

types of sSmpe^Available from medical practices. FPCs and Health Boards are currently r  urfred to prepare lists of doctors in their area but these only give the doctors    name^and addresses, surgery times and particulars of any appointments system. These lists are only available from FPCs or Health Boards and in some cases from post offices. The need for more comprehensive and accessible information is increasifjgfjftjeing recognised by the profession itself. The Royal College of General Pn^fitrpn^rs has recently been examining the extent and type of information that shourcKbeavaiiable to patients from the practice with which they are registered and hasoeppyrtaged practices to produce brochures outlining the organisation of the pracitfK/Ojitjng the doctors available, any special interests they hold, details of surgery tira$&lt;rotruse of deputising services. The standards committee of the General MedirafQomcil is reviewing its advice about dissemination of information and greKhish Medical Association has said that the information in official lists shou(o  |4ngde more useful in assisting members of the public to choose a family doctatrZfcqxkwemment welcomes these initiatives and would like to build on them so that tmpbnation is provided on every practice and made widely available in the locality tntfMfrLsprgeries and through Family Practitioner Committees and Health Boards. ^pCaNSonsumer groups might also play a role in ensuring that patients had as mucMmiwnation as possible about the services provided by various practices in the areafTJielocal media could also be used to disseminate factual information about pi	for example, surgery

hours, times to telephone, and description of the clinWpejS. Information such as this would help patients to choose the sort of practices^hey want. It. would also help raise public awareness of doctors and encourage people newly moving into an area to sign on with a doctor rather than leave it to the time when treatment is needed, when they might have to have recourse to a hospital acridmtnnd emergency department.	((u

   Choice of doctor 16. The Government believes that the freedom of patients to choose their doctor can be an effective influence on the quality of services. A doctor   s income is derived from the patients registered with him and the satisfaction of those patients ought to be, and generally is, a prime concern. Though this is not always fully understood, patients have the right, wherever practicable, to take their needs to the doctor of their choice. A number of suggestions in this chapter should strengthen the patients    position when choosing a doctor. There should be adequate incentives to doctors to practise in ways that encourage people to join their lists. Patients who are dissatisfied should have all the information they need to choose another doctor. Other measures may be needed. For example, the system for registering with a new doctor is already very simple, though this is not always appreciated, but could be made easier still by allowing a patient to register with a new doctor without, as at present, having to approach the FPC or Health Boards or the doctor whose practice they wish to leave. The Government would welcome views on these and other measures to promote patients    freedom of choice.

Dealing with 17. Information can play a useful role in improving the quality of practice by

problems	being fed back from consumers to providers of services. This can enable doctors

and patients to work together to improve the quality of health care. Some doctors have taken the initiative to establish    patient participation groups    where the patients have the opportunity to discuss with the doctor ways and means of improving the quality of health care. One useful outcome of such groups can be the formation of mutual aid groups of patients with similar problems, which can add to the total support available to such patients and at the same time reduce the demands upon the doctor for individual support. It is important that the difficulties some patients and their families have in getting access to their doctors by telephone are tackled. Answering machines and telephone systems which intercept and redirect calls can be substantial impediments to sick and anxious people seeking help, particularly when there are language and cultural difficulties.

18.	To support a satisfactory relationship between doctor and patient it is important that there are effective arrangements for dealing with the inevitable occasions on which patients consider that they have been provided with less than satisfactory service. The first approach is for the patient to discuss his concern with his doctor. In some cases the involvement of a third party can prove helpful in providing the patient with an explanation of the background to the problem. Most FPCs operate some kind of informal conciliation procedures of this sort and they can often settle complaints to everyone   s staisfaction quickly and efficiently. The Government believes that all FPCs should offer such a service in suitable cases. In Scotland, Health Boards have also been encouraged to make arrangements to try to clear up minor grievances that seem to arise from misunderstandings.

19.	Most serious complaints are dealt with formally under a statutory procedure. This formal procedure, and therefore the suggestions relating to it which follow, apply to all four family practitioner services. Under it, complaints are investigated in the first instance by special committees (known as Service Committees) on behalf of the FPC or Health Board. These committees have an equal number of lay and professional members and a lay chairman. Their function is to establish whether the doctor, dentist, optician or pharmacist has complied with his terms of service and if not to recommend what disciplinary action should be taken.

20.	Almost all serious complaints can be dealt with under the statutory procedures. This includes allegations that a practitioner has failed to exercise a proper degree of skill, knowledge and care in the exercise of his or her professional judgement in clinical matters. But some complaints, for example criticisms of a doctor   s manner or the running of the appointments system, are not matters of contractual liability and cannot be investigated under this procedure. These complaints should not necessarily be the subject of statutory investigation but proper arrangements need to be made to pursue them where appropriate. One approach would be to bring such matters within the scope of the informal conciliation procedures referred to in paragraph 18.


   21.	The statutory procedure is complicated and often time consuming and the   I 1/2	Government believes there is room for improvement in the arrangements. For

example, patients are currently obliged to put their complaint in writing: they may ^\&gt;/y	^ iess daunting if complaints could be made orally in some circumstances. A

complaint against a doctor in England and Wales must normally be lodged within ^Ocight weeks of the incident giving rise to it; in Scotland and Northern Ireland the Ns&apos;-^rariod is normally sue weeks but it can be extended to two months in certain \OxraKnstances. These periods may not be long enough, particularly where there a bereavement. Patients do not always find it easy to present their case. Sem^MtJiot all FPCs allow the Secretary of the Community Health Council to reprereiiruje patient. The Government would welcome suggestions for ways in whicn t^Muerests of patients might most appropriately be represented before Servicrrawjftiittees. The composition of Service Committees may need to be strengthenWWShcreasing the quorum, regularly re-selecting members, and, in England arrifavales, enabling the deputy chairman to take an active part. There may also be advantage in being able to draw members from outside the area of the FPC or Health Board. Finally, Service Committees may need to be given powers to summon witnesses aruj^xamine documents which are directly relevant to the patient   s or practitioii^Twtse. The Government would welcome comments on these suggestions. &apos;Oy^^\

Education	22. In recent years the RoTOp&amp;wlege of General Practitioners has been actively

promoting better standardsxfyraCTce, and the MRCGP examination has been introduced. Doctors wishing femrel^eneral practice now have to complete at least 3 years vocational training. Tnb&amp;ievelopments have helped to establish general practice more clearly as a dirap  rajng and rewarding career choice. This change in attitude has been mirrorea^-ffljsf^asing emphasis on primary care in the undergraduate syllabus. However/t^WHirgraduate course content varies widely between medical schools, and inS^une^neral practice still only forms a relatively small part of the curriculum. Thwo%^&amp;me for greater emphasis on the role of primary care and its interface with th  &lt;iio  pjml and specialist services. This would benefit not only those who then decide li^jeeprontry to a general practice vocational training scheme, but also those studeqwyjshing to pursue a career in a hospital specialty since they would carry with theriraraearer understanding of the central role primary health care plays in the health ofcdj^riation. This is a matter principally for the educational and professional bodieix

23. The development of academic Departments of General Practice has helped, and will continue to help, in the development of general practice and the further education of doctors within a particular locality. Continuous prafgraduate education is necessary if doctors are to keep abreast of modem&apos;qjgdjegK developments, maintain and improve their standards of care and aVoidlne professional isolation that can result from their location in small community. There are also encouraging developments in the number Wsmjftars and informal meetings in small groups where doctors can discuss each work. However, less than half of GPs attend any form of post-graduate eotiamoft Increased participation on post-graduate education should be encouraged bra^v\ good practice allowance. The Government accepts in principle the case for raish$g//J/ the proportion of GPs involved in post-graduate education.

Retirement	24. When the NHS started in 1948 the number of young doctors was insufficient ^

to meet demand. In consequence, the arrangements made for elderly doctors were &lt; designed to encourage them to remain in practice. Now that there are adequate numbers of younger doctors who want to enter general practice these arrangements are out of date.


   25.	Unlike hospital doctors who must normally retire at the age of 65, general practitioners do not have a fixed retirement age. They can draw their pension at any time after the age of 60 and many do now retire in their early 60s. However, some stay on considerably longer and there are currently 515 practising in their 70s and a further 76 who are aged 80 and over. It is reasonable to believe that the replacement of very elderly doctors by younger vocationally trained doctors would generally lead to an improvement in the standards of care, particularly in inner city areas where, as discussed in Chapter 9, there is usually an above average number of elderly doctors and an above average incidence of health care problems. The Government therefore intends to change the present arrangements. Compulsory retirement at age 70, with doctors aged 65 and over needing the agreement of the FPC or Health Board to continue to practise might provide an appropriate degree of flexibility whilst ensuring that doctors do not continue to work past the age at which they can be expected to carry out properly the exacting responsibilities of a principal in general practice.

26.	The Government also intends to end the present system known as    24 hour retirement   , under which doctors or dentists in the FPS can    retire   , take their lump sum and begin drawing their pension, and then re-contract with the NHS after a break of just one day. Those who take 24 hour retirement between the ages of 60 and 64 receive their lump sum and pension but the pension is abated so that pay and pension together do not exceed superannuate pay at retirement. The arrangements for those who take 24 hour retirement between the ages of 65 and 69 are even more favourable to them in that they can receive both pension and remuneration in full, without any abatement. This system, which is wholly exceptional in the public sector, is no longer justified.

Relations with the 27. An important feature of general practice in this country   one that has made a

hospital service significant contribution to the effectiveness of the NHS   is the responsibility

placed on family doctors to select and provide access to the right forms of hospital and other specialist care when patients need it. The development in some areas in recent years of new district general and other hospitals has given family doctors greater opportunity to select the most appropriate hospital and hospital consultants to which to refer patients, in the light of their particular needs and circumstances. But very little information is available about the extent to which individual doctors refer their patients to hospital, though there is reason to believe that there are very considerable variations. The Government believes that doctors need to be given information on their referral rates and how these compare with other doctors. The implementation of the Korner Steering Group recommendations in England and Wales should help this.1

28. Because of their unique position in mobilising hospital services for their patients family doctors are well placed to assess the adequacy of the services and to contribute to the planning and setting of priorities by health authorities. This is a development which will be fostered in England and Wales by the arrangements for collaboration between Family Practitioner Committees and District Health Authorities. The DHSS instituted a review of the arrangements for this and identified a variety of ways in which both types of authority can work together in developing co-ordinated services for the benefit of the patient.

Community child 29. For some 70 years doctors have been employed by health or local authorities

health services	to provide and manage a range of preventive and caring services mainly for young

children. To provide these community medical services, District Health Authorities in England and Wales currently employ 6,000 doctors, many part-time, at a cost of about   60 million a year. About 70 per cent of the work of these doctors is spent on child health, and a large part of this time is given over to regular checking of children under school age to monitor progress and see what further help they may need. Yet these checks can most satisfactorily be carried out when the doctor has continuing responsibility for the child and is thus fully aware of his or her medical and family background. This means that very often family doctors may be best placed to provide this service. A number already do so, often working directly with health visitors. The Goverment wishes to increase the numbers of family doctors involved in this work.

1 The NHS/DHSS Steering Group on Health Services Information was appointed in 1980 The relevant recommendations are in its first report, published in 1982.


   30. Consideration is already being given to how this can be achieved and in particular to a number of key points which still need to be resolved, including:

the contents and timing of childhood screening and examinations;

the respective roles of health visitors and doctors;

the training of doctors for this work;

the need to continue to provide a service covering all the childhood population in the district with co-ordinated health authority and family doctor recall and recording systems to prevent children slipping through the net;

the special problems of inner cities where much greater involvement by family doctors may not be realistic

Discussions on some of these issues are already underway with representatives of the professions concerned.

Prevention	31. Many services for prevention of ill health and promotion of good health are

well established in general practice   family planning, cervical cytology, ante and postnatal care, vaccination and immunisation. There is scope for doing more, for example in the early detection of hypertension, in the prevention of coronary heart disease, by advice on smoking, diet and physical fitness. More can also be done in the prevention of mental illness and of incapacity in the elderly. The provision of call and recall systems as a component of a good practice allowance could encourage more family doctors to meet this basic requirement for good practice-based preventive work.

32.	But the work of the practice needs to be related to the work in the Health District or Health Board as a whole. Because many preventive services can be provided both by family doctor services and by health authorities, these two areas of the NHS need to work closely together. Good services can be delivered in different ways, and there needs to be local assessments and experiments. Many are underway. But underpinning local variations in service delivery there needs to be a local health promotion strategy, drawn up jointly by those working in health authority and family practitioner services. This would for example include:

establishing a general preventive health strategy, with specific programmes for specific issues;

setting up systems for exchanging information;

reviewing services provided by both health authorities and family doctors, to see whether a more co-ordinated approach could provide a more cost-effective service.

33.	Prevention is not solely for doctors. Nurses generally, as well as health visitors, and other members of the primary care team have important roles to play. Developments in dentistry and pharmaceutical services are mentioned later.

People can also take positive steps to improve their health, e.g. through a balanced diet, reasonable exercise, and by giving up smoking. The Government intends that

1	discussions on this consultative document should consider what more might be

done to promote this field of activity.

Computers	34. The Royal College of General Practitioners in their policy statement,    Quality

in General Practice   recognises the importance of computers in assessing and reviewing the quality of care provided to patients by family doctors and in general practice management. Computer systems can be used to detect when patients are 1	slipping through the net and to increase the effectiveness of preventive health care

through the introduction of call and recall systems based on age/sex registers and through the introduction of fail-safe methods for reporting and acting on the results of tests. Such systems are already in use in immunisation and screening for cervical cancer. Duplication of services could also be detected and services )	rationalised. The Government has already supported experiments into the use of

micro computers in general practice. It now proposes to set up experimental schemes to explore the feasibility of introducing computer systems to aid quality assessment and performance review.

   ciigjpi^4: Dental Services

Improvemi^^Kl. Over the last decade there have been major improvements in dental health, dental health &gt;  Otouticularly among children. For example, the proportion of five-year olds with &gt;\ji$ual decay fell from nearly three quarters to under half between 1973 and 1983.   oCp  Xnprovements among adults have been smaller but are still significant. y?  wwin 1978 and 1983 the proportion of people with no remaining natural teeth fq|prorjw7 per cent to 25 per cent.

2-	is one the areas where nearly everyone accepts the importance

of the estimation that individuals can make to maintaining their own health through&apos;feafhygiene and by eating less sugar. However, the better availability of SSce[Vati^ 31111 preventive treatment through the general dental service under the NHS has made an important contribution to improvement in dental health. There is also little doubt thatfactors such as the growing use of fluoride toothpaste and fluoridation of wat&amp;&apos;Sitoplies in some parts of the country have contributed to these improvements  ,

rtion of Children with Some Decayed Permanent Teeth in d and Wales in 1973 and 1983


   Offlo3- In August 1985 the Director General of Fair Trading published the conclusions Trading^$\ of his studyint0 the availability of NHS dental treatment and the cost of private Recommefmnftfe dental treatment. He found:

little justification for the serious restrictions then in force on advertising by dentists though emphasising that advertising should be honest, legal and iecent and have regard for professional propriety;

C/\AWk of publicly available information about the cost of private treatment, resulting high variations in the range of charges;

^-Sefcbf information about the availability in a local area of the full range of NHjgti^&amp;tments;

thamjrrent restrictions limiting the involvement of those who are not dentists or doctors in the business side of dentistry were no longer needed.

The abolition of such restrictions should help encourage greater competition in the provisi0ff  f\private dental services, including the provision of more private emei^nc^clinics;

that dentures cc^&amp;tttobtained readily on the NHS (although in London and the South Easdwwfeht be necessary to change dentists to do so) and this provided a competm^rtfeniative to private treatment;

that the responsibility^&amp;f^fttog dentures should remain with dentists, and should not be passed to den^rechnicians.

4.	The General Dental Council^Jre^dy relaxed the current restrictions on

advertising to enable dentists to giv&amp;^Mfptjblic factual information about their practices. Advertisements on hours efocpeiiing and treatment including emergency treatment available on the NHS are	The changes already made will

increase the public   s ability to make infoifadjhwces between dentists, and the Government welcomes them. Further relaxgfid^M restrictions on the nature of the advertising allowed and improved infoi&apos;inati&lt;^iWfLpovate fee scales might bring still more benefits. The Government is pursuirtg^possibilities with the General Dental Council.	V//

5.	For dental practices, alone amongst the primary^ealth care professions, the

law restricts ownership to the professionally Qualified. This restriction was introduced in 1956 and makes it virtually impossible for ^individual or company to offer a full range of primary health care serviceM^he public Removing the restriction would mean that dental care was i^ejC^ted from any moves towards the integrated provision of primary health canS  fvraps by companies or others wishing to offer a full primary care serviaQB^p^location.    Health Care Shops    offering the full range of services might be acJpfegged by many people On the other hand, fears have been expressed that	\

companies or people without professional qualifications to own denwfp^ate&amp;ces might harm professional standards and in particular lead to unnecessar^ujHjhl treatment     a risk possibly greater in dental practice than in other forms

care because dentists are paid in the NHS by item of service The G  vernmCMy^\\ would welcome discussion of the balance of advantage between these twoponf&amp;S^ of view.


   6.	The Government is committed to the prevention of dental ill-health. The

&apos;sUpS&amp;ryice	Health Education Council is running a special campaign to encourage young

A^ftWUity	people to look after their oral health. It has long been known that adding small

(yyfs.	amounts of fluoride to water supplies safely reduces dental decay and the need for

fillings, particularly in children. The Water (Fluoridation) Act 1985 was an important step and confirmed health authorities    power to arrange fluoridation in vy)) their areas. At present, about five million people in England and Wales are N^=^  \supplied with fluoridated water, mostly in the West Midlands. Now the legal &lt;s\v&gt;pWers are clear, there is obviously potential to extend this benefit to more people.

N^  W)ridation is a local choice, but the Government expects health authorities in ^/wkbMhere dental health is poor or the level of attendance at the dentist is &apos;*sjgmpbantly below the national average to consider the benefits of fluoridation miuftticular care.

7.	Prevention is most important for children, and there is tfrQ^CjijQcnsure that dentists have the maximum incentive to give very young patiafpliwprvice properly emphasising preventive care and treatment     for example	hygiene

and the use of new techniques such as fissure sealants which maiigfoethe number of fillings and extractions. In October 1984 the GovemmegKag^ed a pilot scheme within the NHS under which some dentists are paid a   PW fee - an annual lump sum - for their child patients instead of the item fe^^^hy paid for individual fillings, extractions, or other forms of treatment. Th&amp;ggflten successful, and showed that the small number of dentists so far covered teiB^\ like the arrangement. Change to a full-scale scheme is a far-reaching proceraXmoi^ the Government is now extending the experiment to a larger number of dentis^v^&gt;s for a further three years. If, as this second phase progresses, it becomes evident th^pr^ the promising results so far achieved are confirmed, and that the scheme is cost-effective and popular with parents, the Government will make plans to give all ^ children the opportunity of being treated on this basis.	&lt;

   8.	On occasions people may have difficulty in finding a dentist who will accept V them for NHS treatment. There is also sometimes difficulty in getting the full ^1 range of necessary treatment from dentists in contract with the NHS, particularly   Stems such as dentures. The first problem might be solved if the minimum times &apos;^      hcn individual dentists were available to provide NHS treatment were specified ^SrZgreement in their NHS contracts. They would then be obliged to offer NHS to anyone seeking a vacant appointment during the hours specified by Sireelw&amp;t for treating NHS patients. Patients might have more certainty of access to^fS^range of NHS treatment if the contract also required NHS dentists to Drov      ffiil range of normal treatment according to patient need. However, orthSferequire special skills and experience so would not be included m such a eeneiSKirement. To deal with the probably rare cases in which people might still findfficulty in getting NHS treatment, FPCs and Health Boards could be given powS to allocate patients to NHS dentists in the same way that they can already ae allocated to doctors. The Government would like views on whether difficulty ofaccessdpfSJS dentists and the full range of NHS treatment is sufficient to justif^hevisngcs mentioned.

9.	The item of servic^ysjtfn for paying dentists has the meritofmcou^ng high output and efficiSSiyice. However, the quality of service dePfnds partly on the relative value of tfrf/tfH&amp;ent item of service payments. Probably the most important opportunity thskSgS^tist has to promote long-term dental&apos;hedth is when he gives patients advi^o&amp;to avoid decay, for exampleby sensible eating and regular cleaning. It &lt;&amp;  %mes asserted that the dentists NHS 1B1 and payment ammgeE^de little or no cover for MSI fact it is covered by the fee for    chS^S^nination, advice and report, whichi is included in the NHS payments to deSSSfor all courses of treatment except thos riven in emergency. iLTreventive d&amp;SgtaMB dental services might however be improved if the requirement to give p  &amp;  J^ice on maintaining were more fully and emphatically defined ^j^sts    contracts than ^ present, and perhaps also if this item were given greato^^inthe payment syst         relative to treatments such as fillings and ext&amp;jS# The Government will discuss these possibilities with the dental profession.

10 One of the results of item of service payments^that they appear to lead some

dentists - albeit a small minority - to undertake unneces!sary trealtment The

Government set up a Committee of Enquiry m England

report has recently been published. The Committee

significant and unacceptable amount of deliberate

a larger amount attributable to an out-of-date treatment

also particularly concerned about unnecessary orthodontic tr^t^^However,

they did not consider that the problem is so widespread that pati^tfjhmiici in

general lose confidence in their dentists.

11. They recommended improving monitoring of dental practice; st^%^ers for FPCs and the Dental Estimates Board to deal with suspected overtr&lt;&amp;$  &amp;ij\ cases; clearer and more public criteria for giving or refusing approval to where this is required in advance; the development of more realistic cnten^^^^N approving orthodontic treatment; more explicit warnings to dentists agmnsO^^ treatment by the General Dental Council; more guidance to the profession generally on treatment standards; and guidance to patients on their own role an (  S

rights of choice as consumers.	^


   12.	The Government endorses the Committee   s general approach and consultation with the interests affected is already under way. The Government (  JJyhopes to introduce the majority of the recommendations later this year.

Community \\yfy The Community Dental Service has, since 1948, performed the important

Dental Services^^f^don of inspecting children   s teeth and providing them with some treatment

decline in dental caries amongst children, the fall in the school p^mamn, and the increase in the number of general dental practitioners, the nee^OTjputine inspections and treatment of children through the community dentzd^eraceis now less clear. However, there is a need for increased effort in dental lrakptducation, group preventive programmes, screening in areas of special nft6a, and the treatment of people who for other reasons require special care such as some mentally handicapped people. The Government intends to discuss the development of the community dental service along these lines with the professional and ottepinterests concerned. A consequence would be that in most parts of the countrfrth^/outine care and treatment of schoolchildren would in future be undertakeBte^Sneral dental practitioners; and that in all areas the role of the community demal^seryice should be reviewed to determine the best use for it and the most fruitful reiairwislup with the general dental services.

Retirement	14. There is at present no n^Arabement age for general dental practitioners.

They can draw their pension at apj^me after the age of 60 but some stay on much longer and there are over 400 dmnjitiateed 65 or more still in contract with FPCs and Health Boards. As with doctot^vtieteare good reasons for reviewing the present arrangements so that dentistfV&amp;w^ontinue working in theNHS beyond the age when this is sensible. The Govefcnrfint will discuss with the profession whether compulsory retirement at 65 otffwptid be reasonable. If 65 is chosen as the general rule, FPCs should be able to   grao^spsions up to age 70 where this     was justified on service grounds. The Goveriimenprill also discuss with the profession whether the present entitlement to i  M3&amp;niority payments until retirement is providing an artificial incentive toreimnnip NHS practice beyond a reasonable age.	xs

Training and 15. Discussions are already in progress on a scheme to encourage newly qualified

Education	dentists not to enter practice on their own account without a period of vocational

training with a dentist suitably experienced in general practic^^help meet concern over anaesthetic skills available within the dental prMKsraa^the Government has agreed to fund some extra hospital posts form^fSoiftWaduate training of dentists in the techniques of general anaesthesia.

16. Dentistry is likely to see changes in clinical techniques and matefuLfemthe coming years. It is important that dentists already in practice should up-to-date and take refresher training when necessary. The Government discussing with professional and academic interests whether existing post-qualification training opportunities are sufficient and how any increaMqf^^V refresher training could best be financed within necessarily limited resources.

   j2Sh&gt;ter 5: Pharmaceutical Services

ImpottOTorof 1. There is rising public interest in medicines and health. Patients need their Pharmacyv&gt;&gt; medicines promptly and accurately dispensed; but they also want to understand more about their treatment and possible side-effects, and to accept a greater rsonal responsibility for their own health. There is increased recognition that N&quot;&gt;^Sqjdividuals can make a significant contribution to avoiding ill-health, and that a &gt;S/&apos;*jdllicious measure of self-care can assist in the maintenance of good health. The ^jtiramacist has a traditional role as an accessible and responsible source of advice gJrourthe treatment of minor ailments. The advice can include suggestions for m^rcuK available without prescription    over-the counter   , or a recommendation to coriralUkdoctor at once or if symptoms persist. This advisory role is in addition to thdimJ^tant task of dispensing accurately and promptly medicines prescribed by doctore^iria counselling patients on their use.

2.	There nus however been a shift of emphasis in the pharmacist   s role.

Community pharmacists are now rarely called upon to make up a medicine from ingredients althouehatone time this was the very essence of their skill. Most medicines are nowwipmied in a form suitable for dispensing and increasingly in a form for direct supmy ip4he patient. Medicines have become more numerous and are more powerful. Tm!y&quot;aw able to provide relief or cure for a wide range of illnesses but they bring^izfflifftem also the possibility of unexpected or adverse side-effects. While the pKamrakt   s knowledge about the composition and formulation of medicines iwi^w^less important component of retail pharmacy, other components of the phanrwas&gt;   s knowledge are increasingly important. The action of medicines in patients*dMH&gt;fl|litations of medicines, their contraindications and side-effects, and^tfemjteractions between different medicines and foods are all important in modenrMmifloat as are the varying ways different people respond to medicines.

Extended Role 3. The Government believes that these deypltipptents create a need and provide an for Pharmacists	opportunity for pharmacy skills to be put to^pdnHyd better use. It therefore

welcomed the initiative taken in 1984 by the Nuffi^ld-Foundation in setting up an enquiry into the future development of pharmafijS^ith the benefit of their report and the debate that will follow its publication, thrap^nment will examine carefully and positively what additional contributiimpharmacies might make to NHS primary care, and how that contribution woulcrbest be monitored and paid for to ensure the right quality of service and value for money.

4.	Various suggestions have been made in evidence to the Nuirieki enquiry, such as:	^

a renewal of emphasis on the pharmacist   s role in advisingoatjOTts on minor symptoms, and on the most sensible and effective ways of uSirjravfcchcines;

increased domiciliary services, or home collection and delivery including perhaps mobile or part-time pharmacies, to improve sdmw^K people who are housebound or in isolated communities;

the encouragement of pharmacists to participate more actively in the continuing education of other workers who contribute towards communjw^v^ health such as health visitors, district nurses, social workers, home help organisers, or those managing residential homes for those with special need such as elderly people and mentally handicapped people. The aim would be to equip such workers better to detect problems with medicines or their	Cr

administration and to provide them with a source of specialist help;	&lt;/


   L	the use of pharmacies to display health education and health

/\\ promotion material;

yyS. the keeping by pharmacists of records of medicines prescribed for or \  vyy purchased by individual patients. This would help to detect adverse reactions ys and interactions for individual patients and could help patients and their /jyyiocxoTS. It might be particularly useful for elderly patients who tend to take a number of different medicines and regularly use the same pharmacy;

&lt;^    npouragement of some pharmacists to specialise in advising general pl&amp;cntjapers on the administration and handling of particularly complex simsdmces, eg cancer treatment and intravenous feeding;

through membership of Drug and Therapeutic Committees, or other agreed local arrangements, the offering of advice by pharmacists to doctors on economic an defective prescribing generally and more specifically on the effects of mraiciitts, their interactions with each other, and ways of encouraging^stiejS&gt;to gain the maximum benefit from drugs.

5.	The use of compurajsj%pharmacy practice has increased rapidly and many pharmacies now have cqmftmxs which could be used to store information on prescriptions and/or patfemtf  H)&amp;. which can communicate with other machines. This opens up many interestm^pKsibilities for the sharing of information, the updating of records and speedipraxhmunication generally and would greatly facilitate some of the developmmpdwcribed above: Trials will begin shortly to test whether information on meai&amp;ras^shn be communicated automatically from pharmacies to the Prescription PridmM^hority.

6.	As more conditions become treataoK  ulfecommunity it is important to

ensure that the appropriate facilities for uidurehiment are available as cost effectively as possible. For example, oxygeq^dn  jjtrators, which are more cost-effective than cylinders in providing oxy^  meeople who need it in large quantities were introduced into the family pra6tt^merservices in England and Wales in January 1986.	^yy

7.	The role and future development of pharmacy istherefore already the subject of

lively debate within the profession. The issues under discussion have implications for other professions as well as for patients and the NHS. Effective primary health care needs co-operation and team work between the differertvprafessions, and current developments mean there is a need to consider afres^ep  empetence of particular professions to undertake different tasks. Neither the/piofeasions nor the Government would wish to see an extension of the pharmacist   &amp;baJ      ult in confusion over responsibilities to the patient. The Government is,wrapt05less, anxious to ensure that the skill and knowledge of all professions are Wd&amp;their best advantage.	ys

&lt;#V


   The	8. Pharmacy contractors are paid on a    cost-plus    basis, that is, within broad

Contractions bands they are reimbursed their costs and there is an addition which represents Pharmaci&amp;loo\ profit. In June 1985, after a long period of negotiation with the representatives of ^&gt;OA&quot;^ontractors, the Government concluded an agreement on a new NHS contract for V?Vdfctail pharmacy in England and Wales. Similar arrangements were agreed in &lt;X^ejyiand. Two main considerations prompted the change. First, the present ^OTnjrhct is complex and inefficient. In the past large under- or over-payments have Igxlrukleading to disputes between Government and the profession. Secondly, the payjirejtf^rrangements are causing a mismatch between supply and demand whiSf^rore^ses costs to the taxpayer but does not improve services to the patient.

In essejrce^rJnarmacies with small volumes of NHS business incur higher unit costs than those with larger volumes and so under the reimbursement principle they are paid larger sums per prescription. It had been hoped that this would make it easier for small pharmacies to open in small or isolated communities. In practice, the reverarfras happened. There has been a steady increase in the number of pharmacies bramqpt of these have opened in places where there were a number of pharmacies alread^pfekviding a reasonable service. So, since the NHS pays the NHS costs of all ph^bnaores, the cost to the taxpayer goes up but, since the demand was previousTjgrfiw^tely fulfilled, the extra pharmacies provide no real improvement in service. [&apos;yy/\

9.	The new contract remamfbksjfe^lly    cost-plus   , but there will be an improved

system of annual negotiation^m^abst enquiries to a fixed timetable to enable settlements to be reached on 1	year. This will remove as far as

practicable in a    cost-plus* contracrwrnjred for large retrospective adjustments.

10.	Balancing supply and demand	a more selective mechanism which

would encourage the right number olpbran^cies in the right places and which would produce a service which matchesTfien^s^s of the people who use it. The new contract will, therefore, provide for alMmpr^ed level of financial support to essential small pharmacies which provide seivjceglQ mainly rural areas with small populations where they would not otherwise re^ompjnically viable. These will now enjoy a minimum income guarantee to ensore^meir continuing viability and therefore the continuance of services.	^

11.	The other side of this objective is to discourage the opening of further pharmacies in those places, mostly in prosperous dty centresrWihere the demand is already adequately supplied. The free market does not, an^rcarmot, operate here with the full effectiveness because there is no price competiQon^l^e consumer (the patient) either pays the prescription charge or nothing at WLBwthe objective of the new contract has been to introduce the disciplines of a mwjreuwother means. Accordingly, there will be changes in the way remuneratiOT^qjMywhich will encourage contractors to be more cost-effective and efficient an^q&lt;ra^)ise the benefits of economies of scale. This will put pressure on some pharmacire/wth high unit costs which are contributing to the over-supply. Nobody will mi&amp;Hgkd to give up the NHS contract but for those small contractors who, after ex*$aafp(g\ their own commercial judgements, choose to do so compensation payments^&amp;lCv be available for a period of two years. There is no target for the number who

choose to give up their NHS contracts, but the Government expects it to be smwyj^ - perhaps some three per cent of the total, and certainly very much less than the s 600 or so additional pharmacies that have entered the NHS contract during the last six years.	C


   12.	These measures alone will not entirely solve the problem. Any payments system which meant it would never be worthwhile to open an unnecessary small pharmacy would have a detrimental impact on a large number of pharmacies

&apos;^^&gt;XSproviding valuable services, and services to the public would be reduced. So the    ^V&amp;ianges to the payments system will be reinforced by new arrangements for \&gt;&gt;  2inting NHS pharmacy contracts. Instead of the present system of free entry ties any pharmacist or pharmacy company to an NHS contract on vdmjawi, Family Practitioner Committees or Health Boards will have a duty to c^Kidepwhether an application for an additional NHS contract is necessary or deskrajj^OKorder to provide a reasonable standard of NHS services and to refuse the a^plficatjMi where this is not the case. This will help ensure that pharmacies open orcmmge their location to reflect the changing pattern of local needs but will also ensui^hat the taxpayer d s not have to pay for excessive supply. Owners of chemists    shops will, however, remain free to make their own commercial judgements about those retail activities which do not come within the NHS. There will be no regulatierffefony private or retail activities; the purpose is simply to enable the NHS d&amp;^pabiicly-financed service to match its costs to the needs of its patients. This aspefcrwtlWnew contract requires new primary powers which are being sought througH^hej^HS (Amendment) Bill at present before Parliament.

13.	The new contract wmojf^enefits for all. Patients will have a service which refleas more accurately tmjfigadirof the people who use it. Some of the expected savings will help finance theprofesSpn   s wider role and the new remuneration arrangements will be simpler aratfxxe efficient for contraaors. The taxpayer will achieve some savings and betterS^pr/pr money.

Supervision of 14. The Government will be interest^m^ftws about how the skilled resources of

Dispensing	pharmacy can be best deployed. At prercm^taxlispensing of medicines must be

performed either by a pharmacist or unde  riu  airea supervision. The pharmacist must be directly aware of what is being dor^o$J)K staff. Most modem medicines no longer need specialised dispensing skills a^ra^are supplied ready made by the pharmaceutical manufaaurer. A relaxation in^M^nneent supervision requirements for dispensing would enable the phqrm^dst to spend more time dealing directly with the public, explaining and adYfwng on their treatment both with prescribed medicines and with those purchaseffmedidnes which do not require a prescription. The pharmacist would still supervise sales of medicines and take the responsibility for the quality of dispensing, which craftbe carried out by trained technirians or dispensing assistants.	&lt;J

Standards	15. The Terms of Service for pharmacists reflea their professiqnaj/ateand refer

only to the dispensing activity. The shift in emphasis which is alreaftjMtakmg place and, in particular, the adoption of any of the proposals described mn&amp;unavter, need to be accompanied by a clear definition of the standards of serv^^tfffci   provided and the arrangements for their monitoring. The Government ha^^Mp^dy started discussions on standards with the Pharmaceutical Society of Grea^Epitaln.

Training	16. A wider role for pharmacists is likely to put more emphasis on providing

personal services direa to patients. It will be important to ensure that post-registration training supplements pharmacists    scientific training with skills relevant to their wider roles. There may also be a need to enhance technician/ &apos;   &apos;O dispensing assistant training to enable the skills of pharmacists to be re-deployed.	^

The provision of suitable training will be an important issue to be settled before &lt; making any major changes in the role of pharmacists.


   Restricti	17. Medicines vary widely in their nature. Some are very powerful and while they

sale of meu0   would be the treatment of choice for some conditions in some people, for others ^   p^vvthey could be highly dangerous; or they might cause dependence; or they might be \O^Msigned for the treatment of conditions that are serious and require the &lt;^  up  rvision of a doctor. Only a doctor can decide when medicines such as these (pdmhbe safely taken. Other medicines may not call for medical oversight, but cp^kTmjl cause unpleasant side-effects if misused and therefore call for the advice of a^frarmacist. Accordingly medicines are classified under the Medicines Act intoorafeategories:

thcu^dvailable only on prescription from a doctor;

thosenor sale without a prescription but only under the supervision of pharmacist;

those on genriiaftale, ie. available not only from pharmacies but also from other retail traderai   

18.	These restrictionwonttre^ale of medicines clearly act as a valuable safeguard for the public But it iVwjgonant that, in its operation, the system does not impose unnecessary restrictions anu^i^e it more difficult than need be for patients to get medicines they require.

19.	In 1982/83 the DHSS reviaj    Kbe operation of the system and issued new guidelines designed to help pha^rarautical companies seek some relaxation of restrictions applying to their own&apos;pKjatKte. One of the results of this which is both important in its own right and illusmtive)k what can be achieved was that Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflan^JafOTX analgesic, came off prescription in 1983 (action which was followed by the Umt^States a year later).

20.	Despite the steps that have already beeiUiikapthe Government would be

interested to have the views of the interested pmfp&amp;m the operation of the classification system to see whether it would bfaf^mppate to make any further changes.	v//

&lt;y!/sr&gt;


   wghapter 6: General Ophthalmic Services

^^Iwrkoyna	1 There have been major changes recently in the arrangements for supplying

rnWStftom spectacles. These followed a 1982 report on    Opticians and Competition by the Office of Fair Trading which concluded that spectacle prices were unnecessarily

high because of lack of competition between opticians caused by severe

restrictions on advertising. This meant that consumers were denied information to enable them t0 shop around to achieve value for money-7 The Government concluded that competition should be encouraged by ^/  Krebvoving artificial barriers to trade, while retaining appropriate safeguards to consumers. The necessary legal changes were made in the Health and

~  opj  ?Security Act 1984.

3?&lt;f$(i$rst step was to end the opticians    monopoly on the supply of spectacles. FronStp^mber 1984 unregistered suppliers have been allowed to sell spectacles to adultragainst a recent prescription and subject to minimal conditions. This changewas followed in March 1985 by the rempval of the unduly restrictive advertising rules for opticians so that customers may now have the chance to compare the sexriraand goods on offer by different businesses supplying glasses.

NHS Services 4. The recent cttMSa   not affect the arrangranents for NHS sight tests for everyone. Where aaorotman carries out an NHS sight test and believes he has found an abnormafew^ne eye or of some other condition that needs treatment he is required to infoiS/l^tient   s doctor. However the Government concluded that with extended comKfWolCin the supply of glasses and changed social conditions the universal avag&amp;pUy of spectacles under NHS arrangements was no longer justified.	\&lt;j)

5.	In recent years the subsidy fbr#%pectacles had averaged about   5. This subsidy was removed in April 19&amp;  fc$pn that date the general supply of NHS glasses to the public at large was w*fc%U. Vulnerable economic groups continue to be protected by having access to NI    %la  ses. Children, those on supplementary benefit and certain othe^d^s get them free. People on low incomes also get them free or pay smaller  ^es:and those needing the most complex lenses can choose between supplySjfS^e NHS at cost prices or purchase on the private market.	v/!/1

6 A further step is still to come. Now that the     vate market is settling down the Government intends to move to a voucher system under whichthose still entitled to free glasses or remission of charges will no longer be supplied through theNHS but instead by given vouchers which they can exchange fopMget-pnce spectacles on sale through the private market, or put towards the cd^^jrer-pncal^ frames if that is their choice: They will therefore contmuetrtftttfcpNHS helpwith the cost of glasses, but no longer be limited to the somewhai^^^ge ot N Hb frames. Vouchers will be exchangeable only for spectacles whi^tfggie detailea prescription for the individual customer: there will be no increas^^^Wunity for abuse. Separate consultation on the details of this change is alreaQ^m  

progress.	Vx)l

Benefits of the	7. The benefits the Government expected from a more competitive

changes	occurred and will continue. Prices have come down, pnang information ljrfge^

widely available and better displayed, and a wide range of budget-price sped^eOi/^ is now being sold at rates which can compete favourably with the charge for spectacles supplied through the NHS. In some cases single-vision glasses are advertised for private sale at about   12, when the NHS charge for a comparable ^ pair would be over   14.	^


   8.	There have been improvements too in standards of service. The volume of L optical business has increased since the Government liberalised the market ^because public awareness of what is on offer has improved. The number of Sv/ernticians and other retail outlets for the sale of glasses has also increased, and   ^tome major and well-established retail companies have entered the market.

1 goods are therefore more easily available to the public. Many opticians ha^rirrodernised and brightened up their premises and now for the first time offer to mejjttysscriptions for all but the most complex lenses within twenty-four hours. Opti  5jwiave since April 1985 been required to offer patients a copy of their prescriroipfjjir so that shopping around for the best buy and the widest choice is easier. Cnxmll, customers are now being actively courted rather than passively accommodateda better service has resulted, and the cost to the taxpayer has come down.

9.	Taking these m^asofces as a whole, the Government believes that when the NHS supply of glasses (reasaiaqd is replaced with the voucher system the right balance will have been achievahjeryeen maintaining health needs through the NHS sight-test and prescription, sndjqCheasine consumers   freedom of choice in a properly competitive market.


   Chagfe^7: Family Practitioner Services Resources and Priorities

1.	The total expenditure of the family practitioner services in the UK was over   4 &gt;^r^&gt;illion in 1984-85. In that year it accounted for 24 per cent of total NHS spending &apos;\^v  &amp;mpared with less than 22 per cent five years earlier. The primary care services

  ^jriWde vital, immediate, health care, and are a cost-effective way of providing for Cp  opi\who might otherwise need expensive hospital facilities, and the Q^renmaent welcomes the increased proportion of NHS resources devoted to the fan^w^jcactitioner services. But the very size of the funds provided for the FPS mak^fCan the more important to ensure that they are being well used and give good vwp^ror money. The .resources that can be made available to the NHS can never beinnitless. The hospital service also must develop to meet new demands as must the community health services. It is therefore important to establish, and to be able to implement, the right relative priorities within the Health Service.

2.	At a number omSSmus in this document there is discussion of various steps that might be taken to^amjeve the quality and extent of NHS primary care. Many cost money. The extent tOwhum they, or any other developments, can be financed depends not just on mroy available but also on the scope for making better use of the resources that areCm^e^vailable. This chapter therefore gives more details of the way money is spentua^ne  mily practitioner services, and examines some of the implications.

Analysis of	3. In cash terms the gross cost	has increased from about   2 billion in

expenditure	1979-80 to about   4 billion in 1984=S  &lt;\Kter allowing for inflation, the increase

over the five year period was 24 penrenKAS against a cash increase of 100 per cent in the FPS as a whole, the cost of the i  mMek)al services has gone up as follows;

General medical services	109 per cent

General dental services	88 per cent

Medicines	89 per cent

Dispensing	yO	U9 per cent

Figures for the general optical services are not givMUn this chapter in view of the substantial changes that took place in the GOS on rApril 1985.

General Medical 4. The cost of the services is determined by the number of dost  fs, their pay and Services	expenses.1 The remuneration system is complex, but after aKowyig for the average

net pay agreed by the Government for the year the total costsff       02 million for 1984-85 can be accounted for as follows:

  667 million on doctors pay including employers    superannuSifiqp^ contributions;

  313 million for expenses indirectly reimbursed (through fees and ajjp^qces paid to doctors);	\C&gt;y

  135 million for directly reimbursed expenses for staff;

  67 million for expenses on the cost of premises.

V

&lt;5

1 Appendix 2 contains a description of the remuneration systems for each of the practitioner services.


   5.	The number of doctors has gone up from 26,345 in 1979-80 to 29,137 in 1984-85 (about 11 per cent). The average net pay increased from   12,867 to   21,615 for each doctor, an increase of about 10 per cent after allowing for inflation.

6.	There are no charges to patients for services provided by a doctor under the general medical services.

General dental 7. As with the general medical services, the cost of the general dental services is services	determined by the numbers of practitioners and by their pay and expenses.1 The

number of dentists went up from 14,200 in 1979-80 to 16,477 in 1984-85, an increase of 16 per cent. Their target average net income went up to   18,707 and their estimated average expenses went up to   27,433, increases of about 10 per cent in each case after inflation.

8.	As explained in Appendix 2 the fees paid to a dentist are made up of two elements. The first reimburses their practice expenses in full and the second provides them with an average net income which is agreed annually by the Government. In 1984/85 the fees paid amounted to nearly   750 million comprising:

  419 million on expenses;

  331 million on pay, including FPCs    contribution to the dentists   

superannuation scheme.

To this cost patients contributed about   195 million by way of charges. In April 1985 changes were made in the structure of dental charges. Patients pay a fixed charge for some treatments such as dentures and crowns; for other treatment they meet the full cost up to   17; if the treatment costs more than that amount, the patient pays   17 plus two-fifths of the balance. No patient pays more than   115 for a single course of treatment, and some who are not exempt from charges may be able to obtain help in meeting them. Children, expectant and new mothers and those on low incomes do not pay anything for their treatment. The effect of the exemptions in 1984/85 was that about 63 per cent of all courses of treatment were provided free. Check-ups are free to everyone.

Pharmaceutical 9. Expenditure on the pharmaceutical services is determined by the cost of the Services	medicines prescribed by doctors and dentists and by the cost of dispensing them.

The size of the latter item is mainly accounted for by the number of pharmacies and by the pay of pharmacists and other dispensing expenses. Total expenditure increased from   981 million in 1979-80 to   1,913 million in 1984-85, a rise of 28 per cent after inflation. The 1984-85 costs were made up as follows:

  1,484 million on medicines;

  429 million on dispensing.

In 1984-85 patients contributed   145 million to the total cost of the pharmaceutical services, about 7 per cent. The charging arrangements are different from those in the general dental services. First the charge made to paying patients for each item on their prescription in a flat-rate charge regardless of the cost of the medicine. Second, there are more extensive exemptions from charges: in addition to those groups exempt from dental charges and those with certain specified conditions, all those over pensionable age are exempt regardless of income. For those who do pay it is possible to purchase a prepayment certificate which     like a season ticket - allows a patient an unlimited number of prescription items for a set period without any additional charge. As a result of these arrangements in 1984-85 73 per cent of prescribed items were dispensed free. A further 5 per cent were covered by prepayment certificates.

1 Within any financial year the cost is directly related to the number and types of treatment given: over the longer term there are arrangements to ensure that sums paid match the intended average net income plus expenses incurred.

Managing the 10. Because the cost oF^pefamily practitioner services is to a substantial extent costs of the	driven by demands placedgftpflteervices, particularly for medicines, it is difficult

family	to control many of the factdps^rofh determine the overall level of expenditure in

practitioner	the short term. The normal disa^topof annual cash limits would not therefore be

services	practicable either for the farniiroracmioner services alone or jointly with the

hospital and community health S8C^i  NA.lthough the remuneration systems described in this document contaiiMroprant regulators and controls which help to ensure that family practitioner serv^^areprovided economically, the services are subject to few direct controls by GovOT^tmt. This places a special responsibility on everyone to ensure thanni^y^payer   s interest is safeguarded and that value for money is obtained.

11.	In the longer term the expenditure on the Fre^wieppt for the drugs bill, is largely determined by the number of practitioner^iheir pay and the expenses they incur. It is desirable now to examine ways of improving the planning and control of expenditure - while at the same time preserving the essential features of the services, including the independent status of the contractor and their clinical freedom - with the object of helping to achieve the approprfatwates of growth in expenditure on the FPS having regard to the needs of the re^UjpnesNHS.

12.	The Government is taking five major steps to improve the	of the

existing systems that determine the various costs of the FPS:

First, it is obtaining better information on doctors    workload iqx^roeration with the profession so that the Doctors    and Dentists    Review Body&amp;OTe better informed when framing recommendations on pay of doctor^//\

Second, as part of the new contract for pharmacists if has arranged profession to institute annual inquiries into the components of remunei^^v^ so as to avoid the large build ups of arrears or overpayments that have occurred in the past;

Third, in the negotiations on the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme it ^ is exploring with the industry ways of increasing incentives to reducing the ^ rate of rise in pharmaceutical costs;	^


      millions


   (_))	Fourth, the selected list arrangements for medicines have introduced an

additional element of economy into the prescribing of medicines and have released significant funds for the health service;

Fifth, the Government is improving its own procedure for forecasting the rate

of growth in FPS expenditure.

The repayment of practice expenses accounts for a large proportion ofthe vTy^fbtal cost of the family practitioner services. Where expenses are reimbursed to the ^professions as a whole through fees paid at standard rates, practitioners have a   %&amp;ful incentive to avoid extravagance. Among the matters which the   &amp;  iment will want to discuss with the medical profession are whether two scb^SLof direct reimbursement of expenses - for premises and for ancillary staff    	in ways that encourage doctors to incur expenditure at reasonable levels.

Number of	14. m&amp;owth in FPS expenditure is linked to the growth in the numbers of

practitioners	practitXrs in contract with the NHS. FPCs and Health Boards are ^uired by

practitio	g| ^ emer .nto contract wkh qualified doctors, dentists, pharmacists and

opticians regardlpsa-qf the existing level of provision.

15. The numb^kpMoctors and dentists working in the family practitioner services have incS&amp;^er the years faster than the population. And the Government inten^&amp;ere should be further increases, though-- * direct effect these hi^^FK costs - these cannot be uncontrolled if decisions are to be taken on the^^Suture priorities of the FPS and the hospital and community health senS^are different ways of influencing the growth rates in the numbers of pracurjS&amp;te. As outlined in Chapter 5, the new NHS contract with the pharmace^S^fession is designed to limit the number of contractors to what is requireSS^de an adequate service to the publicln April 1985 new immigration ru2    ^to effect to control the number doctors and dentists coming hereiS&amp;oyment. The retirement rate is another factor and Chapters 3 and 4 discuss&amp;Spfobility of arranging for the retirement of the more elderly doctors and dentiJSjg^e necessary to    ntroduce legislation to provide a reserve power to muu&amp;en access to contract with F and Health Boards. For the longer term it ^  esfiaary to review the numbers o student training places. Such a review of theSZW of medical student Places* already planned to start later in 1986, and thet  *6nment proposes to consider with the dental and academic concerned whethSihere should be reductions in the intake to dental schools in addition to those that have already been made.

16 Policies to influence the numbers of practitioners incpgttact with the bTHS need to be framed in such a way as to support policies of services. In the case of doctors there are already arraritofln^or this, in tne case of dentists there have long been significant differences fotfjferage number

of people per dentist in different parts of the co   ni^tho^g^^aHt5    declined over the last five years there are still substantial geogrS^^Hjspantiw.

For instance in the Trent Region there are nearly twice asmany pbg$fc^ dratist as in the North West Thames Region, and about one-third more thanpegerag for the UK as a whole. In 1983 the British Dental Association provider       with information about the higher levels of earnings that should be least well provided parts of the country. It remains to be seen whether thi^fcjd to a more even distribution or whether other measures are needed, such as^  7 redistribution of income to provide financial incentives or using the reserve to control entry to contract referred to in the previous paragraph.

&apos; In the case of doctors this is subject to the decisions of the Medical Practices Committee and the comparable	^

Scottish Committee and to the compulsory vocational training requirement.

Medicines	17. The medicines^Sw^ired under the family practitioner services in the UK cost

about   1,480 million wj^^85. The bill for these medicines has increased in cash terms by over 13 per ceh^^aiacover the last five years and in 1984-85 accounted for 36 per cent of gross lamnrajactitioner services expenditure.

18.	The introduction of newmetiidries has been responsible for significant

advances in the treamtnet of illrai&amp;^iuch of the increased expenditure on NHS prescriptions in the family pracfvkgper^ervices has therefore provided value for money in terms of benefits to patiSHi^Fwnvever, there is general agreement that economies could be made on the dnws&apos;ojltVithout affecting patient care, for example, by not prescribing when drug^kireminecessary, by prescribing generic drugs rather than expensive proprietary 4wjs$when possible. The Government has already taken some action to secure better	money by introducing from

April 1985 a selected list of drugs, which restorafije range of medicines available under the NHS in certain categories, mainly sifiJmiremedies, to those which meet all clinical needs at the lowest possible cost to the^NH^This policy is already achieving significant benefits by making availabl^tffthe Health Service an estimated   75 million in annual savings which woula not otherwise have been available.

19.	The Department of Health and Social Services in Nortfr^rrrlreland has since the middle of 1984 been pursuing a comprehensive programme     action aimed at promoting safe, effective and economical prescribing whichsfiarfflm turn reduce unnecessary public expenditure. The early signs are that this acKgrft^dfchieving the desired results.

20.	In September 1985, the Health Departments held a conference o^fumbrested

parties to consider the future action to achieve more effective and economje  &gt;. prescribing throughout the UK. They have since been engaged in discussfot^yh the medical and pharmaceutical professions about how to take this forwansfrfrog^V first result has been agreement on the need to provide individual doctors with^v^ better information on their own prescribing patterns and how they compare withxw other doctors. The Government has allocated funds to the Prescription Pricing Authority and Welsh Pricing Committee for new computers for this purpose^ and ^ discussions are continuing with the medical profession and other professions on	v

the type of information that should be provided. Methods are also being developed for providing such information in Scotland. Other matters under consideration include: y .......


   


   fm)	how to make more helpful to doctors the sorts of information they receive

about the therapeutic benefits and side-effects and comparative prices of vCvA-s	different medicines;

encouraging the use of local practice formularies to achieve more rational prescribing;

encouraging doctors not to prescribe when no medicine is necessary; and

educating the public about the properties of medicines and the importance of compliance with the doctor   s instructions.

Parallel with this, the Government has entered into discussions with the y^raswdation of British Pharmaceutical Industry on ways in which the prices of mredjet^es supplied to the NHS may be determined in future so as to achieve both artieagfifc of stability that would enable a successful industry to plan further invOTmgffiand research and development with greater confidence and the means of en  wragAat expenditure on drugs does not imbalance the NHS. A description of the omem arrangements for controlling the cost to the NHS of drugs supplied by the pharmaceutical industry is given in Appendix 3.

The Structure of 22. NHS dental costs have risen very considerably in recent years. As indicated in patient charges	paragraph 8, the structure of these charges is complicated. It could be changed so

as to relate the paMnenjsjnade by patients more closely to the cost of the treatment they recelwiySi&apos;Mep was taken in this direction in the pattern of charges introduced in April lySgofchfc result is that though people who have relatively little work done at any one tigK^mhpay a greater proportion of its cost, those who have extensive intervention noM^mjt&amp;a fairer contribution than they did before. It would be possible to take tra^nper towards wholly proportionate charges, and in fact the British Dental Assocfeurahihas recently indicated that it would favour such a move. A fully proportionM&apos;srorem under which patients not exempt would pay a uniform proportion of cosb^m^be simpler than the present arrangements.

   n 23. For prescription charges a closer link between drug costs and the charges paid ^\might be fairer. In France and Portugal, for example, the basic charge levied for fv&gt;kugs dispensed is augmented by a percentage charge based on the cost of the ^/dyfcdicine. In some other countries, the level of charges is related to the importance /pHifemedicine: life saving medicines may be free (as in Belgium, France, and ip$f    .attract only a small percentage charge based upon the medicine cost (Doyrark. Sweden), and medicines at the other end of the scale of importance ma    ^wrged for in full. Whatever charging arrangement is adopted, arranMn(eaf&amp; on existing lines for pre-payment certificates could be retained as a safeguararior those likely to require an above average number of prescriptions.

24.	The Government would welcome views of the case for changes.


   Chapter 8^Qfciaiity in Primary Health Care

1.	&lt;Pne/OTality of health care is determined largely by the standards of the prof&lt;    ipijakpeople giving it and by those of the authorities responsible for manafrortnMervices. There is much in the primary care system that those responsftH  tfr it can be proud of, but with so many thousand health care workers and over 300 authorities involved it is hardly surprising that standards should vary.

2.	Many of the issues discussed in this Paper are relevant to the quality of the

services     the provisjonrof information to patients about practices, the greater use of computers, extereiorVbf postgraduate education and so on     and there are already a number OQQm3&gt;of    quality control    in operation throughout the United Kingdom:	(CY)

professional bodies^    K*tfie standards of those who wish to provide training, eg in general^rajiral practice and in nursing;

FPCs, Health Boards, anam^ESA administer a scheme for testing samples of medicines dispensed byraJarmacists: the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain act as agents for the  eajjj&gt;Pepartments;

FPCs, Health Boards, and the GS^rapect practice premises;

the DHSS and Welsh Office Dentafwteteice Service, the SHHD Regional Dental Service and the DHSS NorthepiHpfel^nd Referral Dental Service examine a proportion of patients;

the Dental Estimates Board, Scottish DefjgHpfimates Board and the CSA refuse approval for dental treatment it judgevmmpcessary.

In addition:	\\

the DHSS Regional Medical Service, the Division Medical Office in Wales, and the DHSS Northern Ireland prescribing unit visit doctors with particular reference to prescribing patterns;	ui)

the DHSS and Welsh Office carry out performance reviwfo&lt;SR?PCs; and the DHSS Northern Ireland carries out accountability reviews(aQJretaur Health Boards and the CSA;

RHAs and in Wales, the Welsh Office, carry out performance DHAs dealing with community services among other things.

To this list may possibly be added in the future the assessment of the stanraricKah those doctors who apply for the good practice allowance discussed in Chap^c3^&gt;\


   3.	The setting of professional standards is very much a matter for the professional bodies. The main responsibility of Government is for the standards of service delivery. In April 1985 FPCs were reconstituted as free-standing health authorities, a major objective being to improve collaboration between the primary care services by establishing separate Committees able to claim a place as of right at the

&apos;^    ^lanning table. The evidence so far is that the change of status is having the effect   ^jftended. But effective planning can only take place against a background of v^ttular appraisal of the quality and quantity of services being provided. It is c&apos;Api  v dear that there is a need for FPCs to develop more systematic means of quality and detecting shortfalls in the provision of services. A number ofprorjjising ideas have emerged and some initiatives have been taken, for exarf?  k  Jff  ornpiling reports about services. The Citizens    Advice Bureau, voluntawtfMrties, and Community Health Councils can be a valuable source of information consumer attitudes. Committees could also undertake their own consumerSiirveys or retain an agency to conduct one on their behalf. An analysis of complaints, both written and oral, can shed light on standards of care. Closer working relationshmcould be established with many national and local bodies representing clienvWChbs such as the mentally and physically handicapped and the elderly, the gre  m^  rity of whom receive their health care in the community.

FPCs also need to exmimhe adequacy and use made of the information they and District Health AtftimWK already hold and how this can contribute to the development of a comptiframipe strategy for assessing standards of care in their area.

4.	Whilst there is a need for FrcMdrfespond to their new responsibilities for standards of service delivery in th^se^ws, the results of major policy changes like this need to be evaluated more indepMsmly. The Government proposes to appoint a team, composed mainly ofoggMikervice personnel, to make a study in depth in one or two areas in England oyujqydfcxs in which primary care services are being co-ordinated, planned and delivereti/A&amp;atting point would be whether the services meet the public   s needs and how thd^mHji be improved within available resources. Amongst other things they would ^rafjiine the ease of access to the services and the extent of the public   s knowlet

5.	In the first place this would be an experiment mmiality control in primary care and its results would be of interest to health authonues elsewhere in the UK. It may well be that the benefits from giving the chairmen and members of FPCs and DH As an independent assessment of the quality of the servicgs^ey are responsible for, and of giving Ministers feedback on the quawfyof primary care at the local level, would justify the costs of a permanent monrt(^ng  9j^em. In this case it would be necessary to consider how such a system shoulo^Seerganised, having regard to the management arrangements for health autnCrfi  $%roughout the UK.

---END OF CHAPTER 8-------


   Chapter 9: Inner Cities

1.	An underlying principle of a national health service is the promotion of equality of access to, and quality of, health services in different parts of the country. The continuing policy of redistributing Hospital and Community Health resources is based on that principle, while taking into account that different areas may have different needs. Yet, for a variety of reasons, the quality of primary health care services available in many inner city areas is almost certainly poorer than elsewhere.

2.	The nature of these problems has been studied closely. As far as London is concerned, a major inquiry was commissioned in 1979 by the London Health Planning Consortium.1 It made a number of recommendations aimed at:

improving the availability of young, vocationally trained general practitioners in inner cities;

the improvement of general practice premises, and the formation of group practices;

the development of primary health care teams;

the better co-ordination of the different agencies involved in primary health care, and the identification of specific management responsibilities within the health authorities for community services;

more education for general practitioners and community nurses;

the involvement of Academic Departments of General Practice with their local primary health care services;

better information for the public about the range of services available within general practice;

better communication arrangements for patients with their general practice;

alternative ways of providing primary health care where existing services are not meeting the needs of certain groups.

3.	The Government recognised the importance of the Report, taken as a whole, and its significance for primary health care in both London and other inner city areas. It has taken steps to promote action by the wide range of bodies at whom the Report   s recommendations were aimed, and some progress has been made on all major fronts identified above. The Government has made additional resources available to implement improvement in inner cities in England. The money is being used:

to provide financial incentives to general practitioners in Inner City Partnership areas to form group practices and to improve the quality of practice premises;

to increase the number of training places for community nurses;

to allow Health Authorities with Inner City Partnership areas in their boundaries to fund improvements directly concerned with the provision of primary health care in those areas;

to fund specific projects or innovations for which either central funding is the most appropriate channel, or which may be    pilots    to be adopted by Health Authorities or Family Practitioner Committees after evaluation.

1 A study group under the chairmanship of Professor Donald Acheson (before his appointment as Chief Medical Officer) was commissioned by the London Health Planning Consortium to define the problems of organising and delivering primary health care in inner London and to make recommendations on how these policies might be overcome. Its report was published in May 1981.


   4.	Many of the proposals in this consultative paper have particular relevance to \ inner city problems. The number of elderly doctors tends to be higher in inner ))   ties than elsewhere and many practise single-handed without proper support ^^staff. The changes to retirement policy proposed in Chapter 3 would accelerate Cv^or replacement by younger vocationally trained doctors who are more likely to V    to practise in groups and as part of a primary health care team. The provision

/^J?rouer information about services should encourage patients to make better use oj^dy doctors, rather than relying on hospital accident and emergency aroaronents, as often happens at present, where staff are not trained in general are unable to Provide continuity of care. As the health problems assoaauxU^th social deprivation call for higher standards of care, inner cities shoulcTg^m particular benefit from the introduction of a good practice allowance. The development of neighbourhood nursing teams should also help because these are the areas where there is most scope for rationalisation of the ways in which members of the primary health care team operate.

5.	But much mof^netds to be done and new approaches need to be developed directed at problem^riecmiar to inner cities. The main problem is often the absence of suitable pQenj&amp;^stfrom which a full primary health care team can operate. Despite the int^mnMn in 1983 of special 60 per cent grants for improvements to certain ijufexfov premises too many GPs in these areas still practice in accommodation^lQpftfc too cramped for adequate support staff. Financial incentives which in otHe&amp;arts of the country have led to major improvements have not always jririveaWfective in encouraging sufficient GPs to inner cities to invest in new premre5s^&amp;&gt;se who do so can receive a    cost rent* which in effect covers the interest pWablepn the capital employed subject to certain limits on building costs. The s^hjimejs operated on a national basis and limits which are generous in some parts d  ii^ountry may not be adequate to cover the higher costs in some inner city area^Fbe Government believes that the scheme needs to be made more sensitive to focat^deds. However, many inner city areas exhibit problems other than those of rel^nZies^hat make it difficult to meet the need for high standard premises and call forMeln^blvement of FPCs, health authorities and local authorities as well as doctore^Bither the available property is unsuitable and cannot be improved and there are nO^iew sites for development or the area is such that doctors will not invest money there because they will be unable to dispose of the premises without financial loss. Onlyjua imaginative and flexible approach by all the agencies concerned can resolve tniS5nroblems.

6.	Although some young and enthusiastic doctors elect to ente^inn^vcity practice, the fact remains that it is a less popular career choice; The high {          living, the shortage of suitable, or suitably priced, private and practice accon^jSafcjafon, and the difficult working conditions mean that working in these areas is gra&amp;cs rewarding both financially and in other respects. There is a case forprwtafy&amp;-financial incentives to ensure that practising in these areas offers equivalerd&lt;2\ attractions to working elsewhere.	\Xj)


   7.	More could be done to make services accessible to ethnic groups and enable

(fj)	them to make better use of the system. For example, in areas serving some Asian

communities where women are reluctant to seek treatment from men there may   I 1/2	need to be special arrangements to attract women doctors and to encourage their

appointment to the vacancies that occur. Special staff could be more widely employed by local health authorities to assist their ethnic populations and to facilitate access to services.

8.	Finally, there may be advantages in developing different contractual    &gt;\Cvarrangements for some doctors. Because the demands of working in inner cities

\v&gt;*eall for special commitment it might be appropriate for FPCs to contract with ^T^jjSbte doctors on the basis of fixed-term contracts for limited periods of say 3-5 v^wap^The nature of such contracts might need to be decided with regard to the {xmfcjr difficulties faced and need not necessarily be determined by generally pi^wnascales of fees and allowances. The Government will explore the post&amp;ja/rycrf experiments along these lines in a small number of pilot areas.

   Cha  ra^lO: Community Nursing Services

There is one important area that has not yet been covered in this discussion

   ^C\ipcument, namely the role of nurses in primary health care. The greatest

\^Mntribution comes from the community nursing services managed and funded in ^^  rfgknd and Wales by District Health Authorities. In England these services are v0m*Wfcd by some 50,000 full and part-time staff employed by health authorities

. .

visitors and school nurses, who have a health promotion/illness p&amp;tertfSbn role largely in relation to children and young people;

dist%t nurses who provide clinical care at home to patients either discharged from hospital or not requiring hospital admission;

and their support staff of registered and enrolled nurses and nursing auxiliaries. Services are also   rovined by community midwives, community psychiatric and community ment^arjlijcap nurses, and other specialist nurses working in the community.	(  ))

2.	These community mj^ftriray work in health authority health centres and clinics, in peoples homes^js^Khremises owned by family doctors. And family doctors may themselves en*    f    phctice nurses - there are some 2150 in terms of whole time equivalents - whopvroOyithin the practice, usually in treatment rooms, providing for example immumsation, cytology. Primary health care is best provided when family doctors, cbtfjpt    toy nurses and practice nurses work together as members of a primary fK&amp;Qjtrcare team.

Review of	3. The Government has launched sepaiw^iwiews of community nursing services.

Community	In England the review was undertaken byaapaty team under the chairmanship of

Nursing Services	Mrs Julia Cumberlege.

The English review team   s report,    Neighbout  ^wNursing     A Focus for Care   , is being published simultaneously with this discus&amp;  y  ucument, and the Government intends that there be discussion and comment on that report as part of the primary care debate in England.

4.	Community nursing reviews are also being undertaken in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Wales, a two year review was initiated in April 1^c?m consider the future pattern of community nursing provision in the lighi^m  particular needs of the Principality, and in relation to primary health care as a	A broadly

comparable review is underway in Northern Ireland. These ar&amp;feswxftd to report in July 1987 and January 1987 respectively. .Aspects of communK^^^ng are also being studied in Scotland in a number of ways. For example, aqg^  ffiding study of primary health care team work,    Health Care in the CommsM^

Review of Activities in Primary Health Care   , commissioned by the Scogfefc^Sme and Health Department, was undertaken during 1985 and its findings m^re/K^ available to Health Boards and professional bodies. Follow up work.to that^rab\ is now being considered, and the recommendations of the Cumberlege reporwvuly/^

as appropriate, be taken into account.	^Jl/

/


   Itecoimnviroions 5. The review was set up because of concern that community nursing services were of the reyfTOwhin no longer meeting people   s needs as efficiently and effectively as they might. The in Englan&lt;kO)	report shares that concern and makes 14 recommendations plus many detailed

^/^vfomments and suggestions covering five main themes:

neighbourhood nursing services /^vmaking better use of nursing skills ^^jmproving the effectiveness of the primary health care team ^iMrees in nurse training

iiva^aSiing public involvement in the way services are run

6.	The report recommends that community nursing services should be planned, organised and provided on a neighbourhood basis. In each neighbourhood, which would cover a population of between 10,000 and 25,000, the work of health visitors, district imrsai and school nurses would be integrated under the control of a neighbourhooaWtftpg manager, in association with community psychiatric nurses, community menjM health nurses and community midwives. This concept is intended to proviaiwSiprellexible use of nursing services under local management, so imprdtfmwfifc delivery of services to the community, collaboration in primary4*  alm^are, and ensuring the best use of training skills.

7.	The review team   s report commends the principle of introducing the    nurse

practitioner    into primary hemrarcana The term    nurse practitioner    which originated in North America, na$3we  &amp;rne had a variety of meanings and could be misleading. But the Govemmeiri   ^hb to see discussion on the important issues of how to make better use ofnuj^Hig skills and clinical expertise, the grade mix in support teams (eg the use of nursirai^Nxiliaries) and whether with additional training some nurses could crostfp^pre to help and assist patients. The Government would also welcome views owinj^jort   s other recommendation in this area which proposes that, as part of ih&amp;mtej&amp;b care programme, nurses should be able to prescribe a limited list of iteS  an$Uontrol drug dosage in well-defined circumstances.	vy&apos;

8.	The Government shares the review team   s beliejrhat the strengthening of the primary health care team is a key objective. The lack of adequate understandings between team members at present can lead to uncertainty apd-inefficiency in the provision of services. There seems advantage therefore in &amp;feaiy coming together, as the report recommends, to produce a written statemenrsfe  Hjg3&gt;ut the agreed activities of the team members. However discussion on this amojndeas for strengthening the team is needed before considering the detailo^^w a statement, or the role the review team saw for it as a qualifying condition fdraw^sentive payments to doctors to improve the quality of general practice.

9.	The report also suggests new measures for identifying and promotiM2POT|. practice. The Government intends to consider this in the wider context ofctfuukv assurance in primary care generally, a subject discussed in Chapter 8.

10.	The statutory educational bodies are at present considering changes in

education. They will no doubt wish to examine carefully the report   s recommendation that there should be a common training course for all first-leve(/\ nurses wishing to work outside hospital in what are now the fields of health	v

visiting, district nursing and school nursing.	&lt;


   11.	The Government recognises thevalueofthe many local groups that exist to represent patients    interests and it may be that more will develop as the report recommends. Mention has already been made in this consultative document of the Xr^^\development of patient participation groups. Informal health care associations ^^^wising in response to perceived local needs may also have a part to play.

he Government is not seeking comment on the review team   s   5e6d&gt;bmendation on the way in which doctors are reimbursed for the cost of Mjpf^ng practice nurses. The total cost of nurses employed by general pnuriiiiOMrs is reimbursed, part to the individual doctor and the remainder in the porit  mjmuneration from which fees and allowances are paid to general practitrane^P&amp;s a whole. If neighbourhood nursing services develop in the ways recommmded, it seems quite likely that more family doctors will wish to obtain their nuremg advice and support from the health authority team. However, it is also likely that some practices will see advantages in employing their own nurses. The Government doesnot propose to end the present arrangement of part direct and part indirect(mimfyirsement of the cost.

13.	The GovemmSt^is^B the recommendation that it should give consideration to amalgamating FF^SMW^Ixiistrict health authorities. But independent Family Practitioner Committe^ro^^een in existence for only one year, and it is too soon to contemplate charqg&amp;&amp;fvch would in any case need to be based.on a close analysis of the likely benejwsTs^y^

14 Tire report also comment^^ijP^hj^ possibility of a salaried family doctor service. The Government believd^Mxufto independent contractor status of family doctors has brought benefitsanasfiwGHspntinue.

15. The Government intends that dhba^dppn the review team   s report, focused on the five main issues identified aboveTrag&amp;rer with the proposals in this consultative document, will provide a frame$*ofck in England for a comprehensive examination of all the major elements of pnjp^i^ care.

   ChariS&amp;Il: Conclusion

Primary health care has played a key role in improving the nation   s health, not    ^Csbnly in the treatment of disease but also in the maintenance and promotion of and in acting as the means by which patients can receive the right kinds of ^yjG%singly specialised hospital services. The Government is firmly committed to VbmSmi on the strengths of the primary care services and to continuing to develop cdmprepfensive care of a high standard, available and accessible to all.

2.	   ng^q&amp;of primary health care has changed significantly over the years, and the ser\ppe^  tve shown a capacity to respond to new needs. This quality will be no less impanram in the future as new challenges arise from technical advances in health can&amp;nd changes in social factors such as the increase in the number of the very old. This paper is designed to open up discussion of ways in which the primary health care^emces can be helped to meet future needs.

3.	The Governments main objectives are:

to give the publi^p^&gt;ice of high quality primary care services;

to encourage high	and responsiveness to the needs of the public;

to obtain better valuwfcorojiey and t0 set clearer priorities for the family practitioner services in relatarfrto the rest of the NHS.

To this end this consultative doorimenOsets out a number of proposals on which views are now sought. Among th  Mi^

the introduction of arrangmen^jro^ecting and rewarding the doctors with the highest standards of care;

increasing the proportion of doctoiVrenwjeration made by way of capitation fees in order to provide an mcepjivfe to doctors to practice in ways that will encourage patients to join theii^sts^

giving information to patients that will enaqte*$an to choose the medical and dental practices that most meet their neeqx

improvements in the arrangements for handling complaints;

arranging for the retirement of elderly doctors and dendsffi.

getting proper local strategies drawn up for the^sitiv^gojBGrion of good health;	(Tj\

improving access to NHS dental services;	  1

placing more emphasis in the dental services an oral hygiene ai^wl&amp;Qtion of decay;

extending the role of pharmacists to provide better advisory and otnb^jN services;

making local studies of the quality of primary health care actually delivered  ^ improving services in inner cities.	/r/


   5.	This paper is a discussion document about the future of a vital part of the \\ health service. The Government hopes that the issues it raises, together with the &apos;J/\report of the review of community nursing services in England, will form the ^T^genda for a widespread debate among the public and professions alike. To carry debate forward the Government will be arranging a series of meetings over the ^rotffcsix months at which the professions and others will be invited to give (?&lt;1apnce. A number of these will be held in areas of England outside London, pgrelcywrly those with inner city areas, and elsewhere in the UK. Written congjrertfs-will also be welcome and should be sent by 31 December 1986 to the addrfsrartnpwn below.

Prima^^t^ilth Care Arrangements In Other Countries

%ppendix discusses the differences and similarities between primary health the UK and that in other countries. There are wide variations to be id arising from differences in needs, geography, historical and cultural peiSroeed^es, and resources available. Some of the differences are very great indeS&amp;TOffj&amp;ke the comparisons manageable and relevant the Appendix concenrafcs on the arrangements in Europe, North America and Australia.

Financing	2. In considering how primary care is funded it is necessary to begin by

commenting on the financing of health care systems as a whole, including secondary care.

3.	Among the couBtrtSS^tudied the UK is unusual in the high proportion (85 per cent) of costs met omowjjpect taxation. By contrast responsibility in the USA rests to a much greatertramon the individual and often on his employer to arrange for the fmanrin  or  palth care through private insurance. However, difference between the twk^mpbs is narrowing as the private health sector in Britain grows and as the Federa^ra!State governments in the USA assume greater responsibility for those ineligfwcOTynable to pay for private insurance.

4.	In Western Europe it is commOrjroroealth care to be funded largely through Social Insurance, under which emproyvteand employees contribute at rates determined by statute. But part of tn^mn^iture may still be met from general taxation. For example about half the	of health care in Norway are met

by Central and Local Government //v.

5.	Payments by users of the services also vai^^dy. In some countries     for example Italy and the Federal Republic of Genrany^eneral practitioner consultations are free, as they are in the UK. In ourfire a charge is made. In Belgium there is a set fee which is reduced for thoS^pn low incomes; in France patients pay 20-30 per cent of the cost of treatment; in Finland primary health care is provided free in health centres but patients are charged 40 per cent of the costs if they go to independent contractor GPs. Prescription charaz^S^common, though their structure varies. In virtually all countries patients arempes{ed to make some contribution towards the cost of their dental care though thcmreifiqds of cost-sharing differ. In France for example the state meets 75	scale

charges but actual fees may be higher than the scale so that the pqrau^ contribution may be greater than 25 Vo. In Sweden 40 Vo of the total^raK&amp;dental care is reimbursed. The coverage of the state system, too, varies and countries provide the full range of dental care to all who are insured undgrtjKfr arrangements. In the Netherlands only 70 Vo of the population are covered&amp;y))

National Health Insurance and in many countries specific treatment, sudras^^N. orthodontics or supply or dentures, are not covered. In Australia the NHS drasv&gt;/\ not cover routine dental treatment at all. In Canada provision varies from	ss

Province to Province: for example, in Saskatchewan dental services are provided ry&apos;y&apos; up to the age of 16, over that age all adults attend private dentists but treatment or /a those on social assistance is paid for by the Province.	/


   w Access to medical 6. In some countries     notably Belgium, France and the Federal Republic of ^veare) j	Germany     patients are able to refer themselves direct to specialists. In the UK,

access to specialist services under the NHS is normally obtained only on referral by the general practitioner. In this country great importance is attached to the role of the family doctor as the co-ordinator and mobiliser of secondary care. This role is enhanced by the requirement on patients to register with a single doctor (a requirement unusual outside the UK and Scandinavia) and by the way in which \()) doctors, nurses and other professionals work together in primary health care &apos;^^V^teams. This country is one of the few which require doctors to undergo three years    NO^&apos;cpcational training before becoming principals in general practice although the N^v/Ej  opean Commission have now prepared a draft Directive that would extend ^  dm^ulsory vocational training to other member States.

Payment of	T Irafost countries nurses and ancillary staff are salaried, but doctors and

Primary Health	denrarare self-employed. Dentists usually are paid on a fee for item of service

Care Workers	basis tyipdib UK. This is also the method of payment for general practitioners in

many cMntries, though in the Netherlands, Italy and parts of Denmark and Spain there is a rapitation system as in this country. In Portugal and Sweden general practitioners are salaried, as are some in Denmark, Greece and Spain.

Medicines	8. The UK occuresatairly central position in its prescribing rates, substantially

lower than Italy, UcwnaUx and France, and similar to Australia the USA and Canada.	{i)J

9.	Comparing the Britigirareton with other countries shows that the principle of charging for medicines isM^frablished though the financial structure differs quite widely. Australia, Be^QQi^he Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and the Federal Republic of Germany JriwCTixed prescription charges like the UK. Some other countries levy charges prrarimpnate to the cost of the medicine (e.g.

Denmark, Finland, France, LuxenS^Sk. Portugal, Spain and Switzerland) while some (such as Greece), combine a ffiftw^charge with a percentage of the cost of the medicine. In some countries charee^wv with the importance of the drug: at one end of the scale lifesaving medicine/mawse free, whilst at the other the full cost is charged.

USA	10. A separate section on developments in tf^SOis worthwhile because of the

recent emergence of Health Maintenance Orgamamj^s (HMOs) as the provider of health care for an increasing proportion of tlwradpulation. The traditional system has provided fee-for-service care. In other wbrds both primary and secondary care are funded from insurance for those able to meet the fees. The HMOs     which provide a complete health care service for those enrolled with them on an annual pre-payment basis     are a response to eu   s  ye health care expenditure in a system that encouraged direct access to sp^sjdi&amp;Hreatment. The HMOs have been successful in reducing expenditure, typicallVeutung in-patient days by about 40 per cent. This was possible in the particular sKn  $K$in the USA. What it demonstrates, however, is the effectiveness of primary carewwgfcians in controlling the use of specialist services.

11.	HMOs are competing with each other for custom. They are out to mpraKra

quality product at a reasonable price: This shows in the emphasis whicrntfrayraace in achieving consumer satisfaction, in the high quality of the informatioinhgpp  \ available to prospective patients, in the accent on good management, in the resources given to the setting of standards and to quality control, coupled witr^x^ remuneration systems that relate doctors    payments to their performance.	/k

12.	A more extended discussion of HMOs is contained in the annex to this	&lt;

appendix.

   ^(^j^iex to Appendix 1 H^^Maintenance Organisations

Introdu&lt;fjtt  \ This is the Report of a visit to the USA which two DHSS officers made during the course of the Government   s review of primary care in order to study Health aintenance Organisations (HMOs). It sets out the background; it explains why Na^/WMOs are a response to the particular situation in the USA; it identifies features ^^O&amp;Kare relevant to any health care system which seeks to be acceptable, effective C/^np^ficient.

Background	care in the USA is delivered by a variety of competitive    providers    and

wa  nd3Sr designed as a system to function in a cost effective and integrated fashioo^Tirere has been expensive duplication, uneven allocation of resources, and until reomtly a disregard for costs. Economic incentives have worked the wrong way and many features of the system, notably the inaccessibility of health services to the poor, compare unfavourably with the UK. However the American environment allaws&amp;r a wide variety of new approaches to a problem to be tested. Experimentation is encouraged by the competitive environment.

3.	In recent years an  wmethod of providing primary and secondary care, the Health Maintenanc  sf    alflsation, has been expanding rapidly in the USA. This is related to current concimftvjhe United States about cost-escalation.

Fee-for-service practice ara^fWnsurance system have led to increases which have alarmed both govemmentMnaSrajJStry, which bears the cost of much health insurance. (For example, Chrg&gt;ijir&amp;iealth care costs add $600 to the price of a car.) Initially the development yQjMQs was stimulated by Federally funded experiments, but now that the mbv  mCTtthas taken off, government had adopted a regulatory and supervisory role. T  yi  g&apos;Offer a prospect of cost containment because they are    managed health ca^^wmips   , surviving as a result of efficient and entrepreneurial management.

The Nature of	4. HMOs are complete health care systems d^kveraig comprehensive care on a

Health	prepayment basis. They compete both with eflSjrtftner, ^ with traditional

Maintenance    fee-for-service    practice. They vary in the prop&lt;m}0j&amp;&gt;f care they themselves Organisations provide, sometimes employing salaried doctors, Mmetimes having arrangements with existing group practices and hospitals, and often buying in the more specialised services that they need. In contrast, health care insurers like Blue Cross reimburse retrospectively for care which has already been gjven. HMO premiums are around $110 per month for an individual, or $250 for ifarnyy. Employers often pay 80*70, but there may be patient charges at the timCD0p5aunent, for example for prescriptions. Subscriptions cover preventive sernjcesJprimary and hospital care, emergency services and complex procedures Ukesorgm7 transplantation. Initially HMOs recruited mainly through emplo^oj3  jch selected a young and healthy population. This effect now is less doVmra  ^nd care is being offered to wider groups. During the last few years HMOs n accepted over 65s, who can apply their Medicare benefits to an HMO subscription. Five years ago the Fiederal Government launched a programige^vv experimental schemes for the elderly in which the premium was paid directlraw^ HMO at 95*70 of the average fee-for-service costs in that area in the previous y&amp;t  / The ability of HMOs to contain costs allowed them to make a considerable pror even though they offered extensive services. However, unless there is some systemv/^, of meeting the costs of care, HMOs cannot provide it For this reason nowhere in v1 the USA do HMOs currently provide comprehensive care to all people in the area,	i


   IzK

Effiagic^V. 5. HMOs have forced competition onto a very fat system, and this is conceded by Measuresadip\	the hospitals who are the sternest critics of HMOs. By bringing the budget of most

Incentives^vOn forms of care under the same management and into close relationship with the Ni^XXdoctors and the hospitals so that their performance can be monitored, HMOs ^Cv&apos;5?ve ^&gt;een able t0 influence medical decision makers. Financial incentives have x^^faegn introduced, the use of hospital facilities has been cut, and drug usage has

6^HM&amp;s normally control access to costly specialist care by insisting that pat^ejafsjkst consult a primary care physician, who in the American context may be aterfmydoctor, a general physician, a paediatrician or an obstetrician/ gynaeo&amp;reKt. The result has typically been a 40 per cent reduction in hospital bed days comaared with fee-for-service practice. This reduction in bed usage has affected tne profit of hospital companies, and it has been predicted that some 1,000 hospitals in the USA will have closed by the year 2000. In Minneapolis-St Paul (where HMOnw particularly active) 60 per cent of hospitals were operating at or below 55 per^en^pccupancy in 1983.

7.	Financial incentivwaraVlmost universal. Doctors are provided with target hospitalisation rates	past performance and their incomes depend on

undershooting this. BetTC  ph&gt;and 20 per cent of income may be withheld until the figures are known and^Mcra^are told monthly of their performance. Doctors are provided with informatronabppt the expenses they incur by their referral of a patient or by the use of labora^w&amp;iadiological investigations. Costly behaviour on the part of one member of a^royamractice can jeopardize everyone   s bonus. Centres can compare costs with eticjratren and they can see which hospitals are the best buy and which specialists lnwe&apos;melowest guaranteed fee for a particular procedure. American hospitals have al&amp;mTppmpeted with each other and HMOs are taking advantage of this. The spare c^pdojyswhich generally existed to avoid turning away trade is a handicap now ther^ieffflter admissions and length of stay is shorter. As a result hospitals are linking to HjH^to protect their market share, closing wards, reducing manpower and settingaSmSSency targets. Doctors are changing their behaviour.	VX/

Consumer	8. To recruit each new patient as a subscriber may cost the HMO $60-100, and

Satisfaction and	there is annual renewal. HMOs must ensure that people are happy so efforts are

Quality Assurance made to inform them about services and to establish persoiufadationships with their doctors. HMOs produce illustrated brochures setting odt tqy doctors    qualifications, experience and special interests. Staff quality^BiHjp&amp;ttant and HMOs can end contracts where necessary. Formal consumer s^veyS^ssess satisfaction, the time taken to answer the phone or book an appbiflranm. in waiting for the doctor, or for laboratory tests to be performed. Incnvmfapv complaints are dealt with rapidly by staff employed to investigate grr^  rc  &gt; Accessibility and availability matter to patients, so locations are plannedjyij&amp;eare. Two HMOs seen had developed city centre offices which open early andwreeflyv late to help those working nearby. Regular newsletters provide information^bmjyv services and health education topics. It is the non-users who change schemes mrav 25 per cent turn-over at renewal time is not uncommon. TV commercials leave*\^7 people in no doubt that their custom is sought after.


   9. HMOs have an interest in demonstrating the quality of their care - which appears to be at least as good as under fee-for-service schemes and under Federal regulations they have to establish a formal quality assurance programme. National guidelines, developed with professional help, do not define quality of care nor dictate methods for its assessment. However, an organisational structure is required which makes professional review possible. There must be a committee responsible for quality assurance activities, accountable to the governing body.

The doctors must be involved in this and its work must be supervised by one of the HMO   s physicians. Regular meetings must take place, and records of the action taken must be kept. The personal commitment of two    medical directors of quality assurance    seen was impressive; one had an annual budget of $500,000 and a team of 10 staff. Methods used include peer group review, and random examination of records for completeness, legibility and the appropriateness of tests, diagnosis and treatment. Attempts were being made to review organisation structure, the process of care, and patient outcome, and to identify problem areas like the care of the young unmarried pregnant patient. Consumer surveys pin-point potential trouble-areas. Quality is valued both for its own sake and because it is an element in the marketing and survival of the organisation. There is cut-throat competition, and an HMO which has a good local reputation is at an advantage.

Medicines	10. Drug costs in the USA have been increasing at 20 per cent per year. HMOs

generally pay for medicines although a contribution of $2-3 is required from the patient. Most HMOs seek savings, sometimes through using their own pocket formulary, which is in effect a Selected List. Generic substitution may be mandatory. Incentives are used, and doctor   s prescribing costs may be one of the factors incorporated into a wider system which determines whether or not he will get a bonus. HMOs are often large enough to negotiate discounts either with pharmacy chains who dispense the prescriptions, or with the manufacturers themselves. One brand of antibiotic may be offered in preference, if its manufacturer makes a good offer. As a result of such efforts one HMO reduced drug costs from 7.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent of its total budget.

Preventive	11. Promotional literature and TV commercials demonstrate the importance of

Medicine	preventive medicine in marketing terms. An HMO which did not provide such

service would not survive. HMOs, given half an indication that advice on conduct, diet, relaxation or exercise is worthwhile, will institute programmes in creative parenting strategies    or    intensive couples workshops   . Nevertheless there is a reality and commitment behind these initiatives, and HMOs provide a good case for proven activities like cervical and breast cancer screening, both of which are widely offered.

Nurses	12. Nurses are employed as managers at the corporate headquarters and at

operational level. They may be given a patient   s admission details and projected length of stay so that progress can be monitored. They may also act as hospital discharge planners, making the necessary arrangements for which the doctors might not find time. Community nursing being cheaper than hospital care, HMOs are developing their own scheme to reduce the time spent in hospital. Nurses also assist in quality assurance, in handling complaints, and in the provision of nurse helplines    to assist patients in an emergency when practice premises may be closed. In addition    nurse practitioners    may work side by side with medical staff as first points of contact for health care. This seemed particularly welcomed by female patients.

Summary	13. For those served, Health Maintenance Organisations provide a high standard

of service. The management of all health care from a locally controlled budget avoids attempts to transfer costs at the margin, and has led to significant savings. Good information and competition has led HMO staff to seek to attract rather than repel patients. Patients can make a better choice of doctor and change with ease. The importance accorded to quality assurance and performance assessment is impressive. There are lessons to be learned from American experience.

Payin^^Professions

y&amp;thfe Appendix describes how doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians in the /jmmjy practitioner services are paid.

Doctors	nJHHystem for paying GPs is, like that of the other professions in the FPS,

ba^giSinhe principle of cost plus, that is the payments they receive are intended to besamejSnt both to cover expenses and provide a given net income to the average&lt;QP

2.	Responsibility for advising the Government on the appropriate level of net income rests with the Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB). The Government deridgSha the light of the DDRB report upon the average level of income for all GKs. Tpe actual amounts individual GPs receive vary, depending on the service they pi  taf  rr!hd the expenses they incur, and some obviously earn more than the averag  jura&gt;orne less. For example, a relatively junior single-handed GP witl^Kftmd 500 patients might earn under   10,000 net, while a GP with a large list of 3,Q^^Sents practising in a group and acting as a GP trainer could have a net in^  n^  excess of   30,000. The average net income which the system is intended ttvrirjywie from June 1985 is   23,440.

3.	Any expense incurred in pr^^jswgeneral medical services is paid back to the profession in full. Some of these^Sprira are paid back to the individual GP incurring them (this is known as    di^^peftnbursement   ). The remainder are reimbursed on an average basis throu^nramdard rate fees and allowances (and usually referred to as    indirect reimburs^jn^n^VIt follows that the exact amout a GP receives by way of indirectly reimburs^Jwtraipses will not, except by chance, equal his or her expenditure and that the G^wffljiave a strong incentive to economy so far as these expenses are concerrtS^^sample survey is conducted each year to establish GPs    average expenses an^Up^P forecast what provision should be made for them in pay in the coming y^s&amp;The provision in fees and allowances for 1985/86 is   11,320 per GP. On top df this, directly reimbursed expenses are expected to average about   12,400 per GP (excluding drug costs). The average GP   s gross income in 1985/86 is therefore expectedje&lt;onsist of   23,400 net income, plus   11,320 in indirectly reimbursed expense^mlu^)E12,400 in directly reimbursed expenses.

4.	With the exception of those expenses which are paid on aik(g  H  dVial basis to the GPs who incur them (see below), both net income and expengK&amp;wwd to GPs through a range of fees and allowances. An individual GP   s iiraxre&amp;epends upon which fees and allowances he or she qualifies for. Fees and alldwaqc&amp;^re of -three principal types.

i.	Capitation Fees

An annual fee is payable for each patient registered with a GR StaMaw^v capitation fees are paid at three rates, depending upon the patient   s that for patients under 65 is currently   6.85 a year; that for patients ag^^ 65-74 is   8.85; and that for patients aged 75 and over is   10.90.	^

Supplementary capitation fees are payable in certain circumstances to doctors undertaking to provide out-of-hours services. Capitation fees account for some 47% of the total paid in fees and allowances.


   ii.	Allowances

OIL?	Apart from capitation fees, the biggest single element in a GP   s pay is

normally Basic Practice Allowance. The full rate allowance of just over   7,000 is payable to all GPs with 1,000 or more patients and who are regarded as devoting a substantial amount of time to general practice. A proportion of the allowance is payable to GPs with smaller lists. Doctors can also receive a Seniority Allowance at one of 3 rates (top rate   4,560 a year), depending on how long they have been in general practice.

Doctors who have yet to become entitled to Seniority Allowances can, if vocationally trained, obtain an allowance of   1,450 a year. There are also allowances for practising in a group of 3 or more doctors for providing &lt;//^j3ut-of-hours cover and for having completed postgraduate training C^^rnducement payments are available to doctors setting up in certain (^jjStsely populated areas. On average, allowances account for some 40% Vof GPs    income from fees and allowances.

iii.	Item of service fees and certain other minor payments

A GP is entitled to a fee each time he provides certain services. For examplaacroctor receives a fee for carrying out some vaccinations or immuriiWierpStof   2.30 or   3.30); for carrying out cervical cytology tests on sonfcwOTien (  6.60); and for making a night visit (  15.55). Doctors alsb-KKaye fees for providing contraceptive services (of up to   29.90 a yearffaftfesWemity medical services (the fee for providing a patient with con^^K^jedical services is   105.00). Fees of this kind account for about le%^S  Jncome from fees and allowances.

   (f V	5. The other element in GPs    income is payments to cover expenses actually

incurred. These include payment normally in full for rent and rates. Doctors who own their own surgeries receive a notional rent equivalent to the current market rental value of the premises as assessed by the District Valuer. (Doctors may also be entitled to receive extra financial help with the cost of building new purpose-built practice premises or improving existing ones). GPs can also claim back 70% of the salary of certain ancillary staff, up to a maximum of 2 staff per GR Other expenses which are directly paid for include the cost of drugs dispensed; xr^  \the salary and expenses of trainee doctors employed by GPs; and the cost of ^&apos;&apos;^Sfcmploying a locum whilst sick or on study leave. About half of the total cost of v&gt;^GRs    expenses is now met through payments of this kind, and half through fees /utiraHowances.

Dentists	lrDejMsts are paid a fee for every item of treatment they give to patients. There

are^flSw^rate fees, and it would obviously be very difficult, if not impossible, to set theScreh  &gt;fee for each and every item of treatment in isolation. So dentists    pay, like thaKrfGPs, is based on the principle that the average dentist should earn a certain insbme before tax from the NHS and have the expenses of running his or her NHS practice met in full. The amount individual dentists earn will depend on the amount of worjuhey do and the amount of expenses they incur.

2.	The net inconrewmch the average dentist should earn is decided by the

Government in	recommendations by the independent Doctors and

Dentists Review Boc&amp;iPv   P^)- When making its recommendation, the DDRB makes use of informatiSMe^t the average dentist   s hours of work and the amount and type of treatmra  *&amp;hich the average dentist does. The average dentist currently works about 30 nginiMveek in the NHS and the average net income the system is required to provide frorj^June 1985 is   20,280.

3.	The amount due to dentists Iw^ro^nses is determined by uprating information about the average dentist   s actuanK  MM   obtained every year from a sample. These expenses are substantial. For^mpte, this year the estimate of average expenses is about   29,000 - getting oIocmM times that for net income.

   4.	After forecasting the number of times the average dentists will do each of the

different forms of treatment, the level of fees is set in such a way that the average dentist can earn an agreed net income. The relationships between the different fees are based largely on the time taken to carry out the different forms of treatment though, for some forms of treatment, the fee includes an allowance for expenses    ^Cvrtiich can be specifically linked to that treatment.

Pharmacists	amount due to pharmacists for dispensing NHS prescriptions is based on

Ctiiejahpur and overheads costs incurred in dispensing NHS prescriptions plus an a^reejjrate of profit. The rate of profit is arrived at through direct negotiation bettfreiiHtte Government and the pharmacists    representative organisation. LabOT^andoverheads costs are assessed by sample statistical enquiries which are held p4&amp;jiHcally, normally, every four years. For non-enquiry years the amounts due areto&amp;eased by the latest statistical indices. The amounts due for labour and overheads plus the agreed rate of profit are paid out to contractors as remuneration in the manner described below. As with doctors and dentists, the payments made tp^S&amp;ay them the cost they incurred in NHS dispensing on an average basis. y

2.	The amounts du^forMspensing are paid to pharmacists through three main types of payment:

i.	a professiondMM^^prescription of an average about 55p but varying according to thwtfpirtK prescription dispensed, in accordance with the scale laid down inrnPPftig Tariff.

ii.	a differential on-coS^Qrowrance calculated at varying percentages of the

wholesale cost of dru^Sma^hphances dispensed (before the application of discountXTl^Mi-cost percentages are on a sliding scale and vary with the numberx^Siescnptions dispensed by contractors during the month. The higli&amp;a  re  f on-cost (23 per cent) is paid where the least number of prescriptiroswp^dispensed during the month (1 to 249 prescriptions), the lowest rareotaj^cost (8.4 per cent) is paid where the greatest number of prescriptiof  j*5flE)dispensed during the month (over 5,000) and there is a full rangeom^st scale points (over 80) between these two extremes.	v/^

iii.	a basic practice allowance at a rate of   3300 per annum is paid for each

pharmacy except one entering into contract with the NHS for the first time after 1 July 1980 where the new pharmacy iswjthin 1 kilometre of another pharmacy.1	(f })

There are also additional payments, not common to every pfiamabh inasmuch as they are only paid for a particular service performed:

iv.	payments for remaining open outside normal hours oiraw^anice.

v. urgent out of hours dispensing.

vi.	oxygen therapy cylinder service.	vcOy

vii.	essential small pharmacy payments (annual grants).

viii.	grants for training pharmacy graduates in their pre-registration yeal^^w^

3.	Pharmacists are also paid the wholesale cost of drugs and appliances dispense^&apos;)

in meeting NHS prescriptions, less the discount which they can on average be ^ expected to obtain from suppliers.	^

1 There is no basic practice allowance as part of the Scottish remuneration arrangements and as a result the basis and levels of professionals fees and payrnentsaredifferent;__&lt;i^&gt;_&gt;i&gt;_^B^


   OptiekMK^ I. Opticians receive a fee for each NHS sight test or NHS dispensing they conduct. The average costs of NHS sight testing and dispensing are settled through negotiations taking into account information obtained from periodic cost \^J/\enquiries, and an agreed profit element is added to arrive at the fees.

Between main enquiries, which are conducted at 4 or 5 yearly intervals, &apos;^^mppnation on costs is updated using appropriate price and earnings indices. A /^f\Hfficulty has been that updating of fees by this means has not prevented the ouijpQsbof sums due to the profession or the Department. This has been urisap^Klctory to both parties and arrangements are in hand to convert to a system of dxjgfljS^fehquiries into opticians    costs. This will bring about annual fee settlembn^&gt;hd will remove the need for time-consuming arrears exercises which have bttxwiecessary from time to time under the old arrangements.

3.	There is a standard sight-test fee payable to ophthalmic opticians. Because of the varying nature of dispensing, however, it is necessary to have seven rates of dispensing fee, takirig^ccount of factors such as type of frame chosen, whether single vision or birocalQenses are dispensed etc However, it is intended to replace the direct supply orRl^S^lasses with a voucher system to enable those still eligible for free supply or helfmjjp&apos;pharges to obtain their glasses from the private market. Dispensing fees^wmap be unnecessary as suppliers will need only to claim the value of the vouqreHranded to them by the patient.

4.	Opticians are responsiblcforapfroaching suppliers of optical appliances (ic frames and/or lenses) for NHSgaaply^nd in addition to receiving a dispensing fee

*	are reimbursed for each NHS ap^a^^ispensed. The rates of reimbursement are

fixed after conducting monitoringSHnropces paid by opticians for their supplies. Reimbursement is not intenaeoidWovide a profit since this is catered for in dispensing fees. These reimbursemeiirarpaijeements will be discontinued once the voucher scheme is introduced.

PharmacettfwSt Price Regulations Scheme (PPRS)

1.	(pKe^ces of NHS drugs are subject to review and a measure of control thro&lt;  ntpfePharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), a non-statutory arranggrcp  hat is administered by the DHSS with the agreement of the drug manufaStrows^

2.	The firstoWective of the PPRS is to secure the availability of safe and effective medicines on-air and reasonable terms to the NHS. As an important secondary objective the PPRS is intended to promote a strong, efficient and profitable pharmaceutical industixm the UK, capable of such sustained research as should lead to the availabilitjfoT^ew and improved medicines both for the NHS and for export. The levels oPj^fjx-fer the industry as a whole which are allowed under the PPRS are based upon areiuraon capital employed which is broadly related at present to the rate of retucaajdfcable to defence contractors.

3.	For the majority of companrephe present method means that reasonable costs incurred in supplying medici^K^wNHS are recovered through the prices charged and the company is allow^d^eam a reasonable profit, expressed as a return on the capital employed. TrerraOTnableness of profits is assessed across a company   s range of products as a wnigteaffice it does not matter to the NHS if a higher profit on one is counterbalance(  bwNjQwer profit on another. The DHSS can, and regularly does, challenge declara&amp;    ts which it regards as unusual or excessive and if appropriate disallow themoeKii^approving proposed price increases or profits returned. Subject to thakfre^%me is inherently cost plus like the arrangement for reimbursing the professidreip^e Family Practitioner Services.

4.	Capital employed is divided into two roughly eq\%mB$hs: Fixed assets, such as land, buildings, plant; and the working capital invol^dln running the business including cash and stocks. While, as the name implies^e value of fixed assets changes relatively slowly, working capital is much more volatile and changes directly in relation to volume of sales.

5.	If a company   s sales fall as a result of more economical pre^mbiUgthere are a number of inter-related effects. Reduced income from sales is omtfMie extent that raw material and energy costs are less and sales-related costs wkra&amp;&apos;  les promotion allowances under the PPRS are automatically reduced, i^iripwpved profit target will also fall because the capital employed, especially the

capital, will also decline with sales. At the end of the day some loss of pi^ftQnmi in some circumstances be recouped through compensating price increases the product range. But generally the cost of such increases will be only a smatt&apos;O) fraction of the value of sales lost. And this effect will in any event tend to disappear within a year or two as the company adjusts to its new trading level. Furthermore, any increases arising from the higher unit costs of the losing company will tend to be offset by the lower unit costs of companies gaining sales, (   Clearly, therefore, it is very much in the financial interest of the NHS for doctors to prescribe the cheapest acceptable medicine available:
