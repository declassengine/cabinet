   ^ POLICY AND RECENT PRACTICE IN RELATION TO REVIEW BODY REPORTS

There is a long-standing commitment (reaffirmed when the NRB was set in July 1983) that the Government will implement the recommendations of W^feview Bodies &apos;unless there are clear and compelling reasons for not doing The AFPRB&apos;s recommendations have never been rejected by the ^P^YsS^ient but were staged in 1984. The DDRB&apos;s recommendations were ab^^cFor staged in 1981, 1982 and 1984. Last year the AFPRB   s recommendations were accepted in full as from 1 April; those of the DDRB were paid in full as from 1 June; and those of the NRB and the TSRB were implemented in stages, with the full increases taking effect in February and March 1986 respectively.

PROPOSALS *OR liPDLING THE REPORTS

4.	Ministe^J^^ctly concerned meeting under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship tej^^Snsidered these recommendations. They noted that, with the exception fijkthe TSRB, the recommendations are all close to the current rate of i^E&amp;e in average earnings in the economy generally, and that comparatively   Itle in the way of salary restructuring has been proposed. They ther^HH^recommend that the Government should adopt a common approach to a^^tt^pbreports apart from that of the TSRB, to which separate considerations^pp^r.

5.	The Review Body recommendations are all substantially above the rate

of inflation, and above the general level of current wage settlements. The costs substantially exceed the provision made within the 1986-87 cash limits, and could not be met	from 1 April without prejudice to

services. The Group of Ministel^Bftcefore recommend that the proposed increases, apart from those recomiqdri^^L by the TSRB, should be implemented with effect from 1 July 1986. ThiMfcj^ reduce the average increases paid during the current financial y^ir	slightly below 6 per cent, the

level of the pay settlement currentl^^gSjk negotiated with non-industrial civil servants.

6.	In the case of the TSRB groups, wher&lt;*^Government&apos; s acceptance

last year of very large increases for some^^tj^most highly paid grades was the subject of severe criticism, the Groiu^H^ommend that the pay bill during the current financial year should be permitted to increase in line with the current rate of inflation, ie 3 per cent. Accordingly the average increases to be paid from 1 July would be about 4 per cent; the pattern would correspond to that recommended by the Review Body. At the same time the Group recommended that the TSRB&apos;s propos^l^: for the introduction of additional discretionary increments a^J^tfrhe present scales for Grades 2 and 3 (Deputy and Under Secretaridll shWild be implemented in the course of the current financial year^g^e additional increments would be awarded to a limited proportion of	these

grades, within rigorously defined criteria for sustained h^j^ performance, would be withdrawable if the recipients&apos; relative performance &lt;||%ed to merit them and would not be pensionable. The ability to awaraj^^ discretionary increments would also provide some flexibility

purposes. At the same time the increments on the normal scales^^t^uced for the first time last year would no longer be automatic for the hew


   entrants to these grades; while the increments would be given unless k performance was below reasonable expectation, a positive decision related ^^o continued performance would need to be taken.

In all cases pensions would be based on the salaries actually in

nt~ in accordance with the principle set out in the Prime Minister s ^PUtlhn Answer on 13 April 1984 (OR, Col 383). Consistently with this prinfl^le, the operation of the Pensions Increase arrangements will be adjusted in the case of the armed forces to prevent the pensions of those retiring between 1 April and 30 June from falling below those who retired up to 31 March 1986. This problem does not arise in the case of other groups.

COSTS &amp;

8. With thlBj^Dtion of the National Health Service (NHS), all the proposed incr^Mff^ill be met from within existing cash limits for 1985-86. Those^^i^tfie TSRB groups present no difficulty. In the case of the armed forces,there is a Government commitment to maintaining comparability of eqKb, planning already assumed that pay increases would be substantial*   higher than the growth of the defence budget; the effect of this is thi^^^^is available for spending elsewhere, notably one equipment, with con,seq%ntial effects on defence capability. In the case of the NHS, the noncash-limited Family Practitioner Services programme is due to be reviewed later in the year, in accordance with normal arrangements for demand-led programmes; in the event of offsetting savings not then being found, some part of the proposed increase would fall to be met in due course fReserve. In the case of the Health Authorities the current cash prc^m^Wi, even after taking into account the growing benefits of the cost im^ttve^it programme and of the faster than expected fall in inflation, wouldlnofje sufficient - against the background of rising demographic	services - to meet the costs

of implementing the Review Body recomm^ijjtions on 1 July and of pay settlements for non-Review Body staff ^^^|ut the same level as for the non-industrial Civil Service, without a dis*  ntive effect on services.

The Chief Secretary, Treasury has accord^iglPkoffered, exceptionally, to provide an additional   60 million for HeaT^^^hority cash limits from the Reserve.

TIMING AND FORM OF ANNOUNCEMENT

9. It is generally understood that the reports are delivered to the Prime Minister in the course of April each year. From^j^ standpoint of the services concerned, there is a clear advantage iA^^uncing decisions on pay increases as soon as possible. The Ministers ^^Lpet under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship therefore recommend that,^Hfc^e Cabinet are able to reach decisions on 22 May, all the reports shoul%|e fcblished that afternoon, and that the Prime Minister should simultaneity announce the Government&apos;s decisions on them by Written Answer, as ii^^ece^t years.

A draft Written Answer, in line with the recommendations set^iybove, is attached at Annex C.

rx


   ^ PRESENTATION

The Group of Ministers noted the particular importance of ensuring the Government&apos;s decisions are effectively presented and explained. s envisaged that the departmental Ministers concerned will make r1ate arrangements to brief representatives of the Government s supporters in the House of Commons, and that the Chancellor of the should write to all Members of Parliament placing the Government&apos;s decisions in their context. This letter, a draft of which is attached at Annex D, would be available in the Vote Office and the Whips&apos; Office at the time of publication of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.

   ANNEX C

REVIEW BODIES 1986

DRAFT WRITTEN REPLY FOR PRIME MINISTER

The 1986 reports of the Review Bodies on the pay of Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicines, Doctors and Dentists, and the Armed Forces, and of the Top Salaries Review Body, have been published today. Copies are now available in the Vote Office. The Government are grateful to members of the Review Bodies for these reports and the time and care which they have put into their preparation.

2.	The reports recommend pay increases from 1 April 1986 which it is estimated would increase the 1986-87 pay bill for nurses, midwives and health visitors by 7.8 per cent, that for the professions allied to medicine by 8.2 per cent, that for doctors and dentists by 7.6 per cent, that for the armed forces by 7.5 per cent, and that for senior grades of the higher Civil Service, senior officers in the armed forces and the judiciary by 6.5 per cent. These figures are all very substantially above the rate of inflation, and above the general level oY current wage settlements.

3.	The Government have nevertheless decided that the increases recommended by the Review Bodies, with the exception of those recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body, should be implemented in full; but having regard to the sums involved, with effect from 1 July 1986. The resulting increases in the pay bills concerned in 1986-87 will average a little under 6 per cent, and this year&apos;s costs will be generally met from within existing public expenditure plans.

4.	This year the Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) programme will benefit from lower inflation, which has already fallen well below the 4.5 per cent expected when the planning total was agreed; and it will also have resources available from planned cost improvements. Nevertheless the Government recognise that implementation as proposed might adversely affect services to patients, and have therefore decided, exceptionally, to provide an extra   60 million for health authority cash limits from within the total of planned public expenditure this

year.

5.	The Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) last year carried out a major review of the remuneration of those covered by their remit, as a result of which they recommended increases, some of them substantial, in the salaries of those concerned. The recommended salaries have been fully in effect since 1 March 1986. This year the Government have decided that the TSRB&apos;s recommendations should be scaled down to an average 4 per cent to take effect from 1 July 1986, thus keeping the effective increase in the pay of this group in 1986-87 in line with inflation, that is 3 per cent In addition the Government have decided in principle to accept the recommendations, first put forward by the TSRB last year, for discretionary pay at Civil Service Grades 2 and 3, as part of the arrangements for strengthening the link between pay and performance at these levels. A fuller account of these proposals is being sent to staff interests, with whom there will be consultation.

   ANNEX D

LETTER FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT REVIEW BODY REPORTS

The Government has today announced decisions on the Reports of the Review Bodies.

Despite the marked fall in inflation to 3 per cent we have agreed to implement all the recommendations, with the exception of those made by the Top Salaries Review Body, in full, but as from 1 July.

They will provide increases averaging 8.2 per cent for professions ancilliary to medicine, 7.8 per cent for nurses, and 7.6 per cent for doctors and dentists. The increase for nurses comes on top of a rise in their pay of around 25 per cent more than inflation since 1979 while the number of nurses has increased by [

].This reflects the importance we attach to the National Health Service and those who work in it. For the armed forces there are increases averaging 7.5 per cent from 1 July. The addition to the paybills for 1986-87 is about 6 per cent.

But the implications of these pay awards in this financial year have to be faced. Defence will live within its budget. For health, implementation as proposed might have adversely affected services to patients and we have therefore decided, exceptionally to provide a further   60 million for health care this year from within the total of planned public expenditure.

I mentioned that we have not accepted the Top Salaries recommendation. This group last year received very substantial increases: we did not judge it necessary this year to go beyond the amount necessary broadly to maintain last year&apos;s pay levels in real terms, while also further improving the link between pay and performance. We have therefore allowed a paybill increase for 1986-87 of 3 per cent, equal to the rate of inflation, which will be secured by paying an average 4 per cent increase from 1 July. This compares with the recommended increases averaging 6.5 per cent.

Since the Review Bodies took their evidence lower inflation has dramatically increased the real value of pay increases. It would be wrong, therefore, to look at these pay increases as in any way a guide for future settlements, either here or elsewhere.

In the public services, as in private firms, we have to be conscious of what can be afforded; if we are not, services and jobs will suf f er.

There will be many in your constituency with an interest in these awards. I hope that this letter will help to explain the approach which, faced with the Review Body recommendations, we have decided to take.
