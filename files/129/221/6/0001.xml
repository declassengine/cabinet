LAND ROVER (UK) LIMITED:	PRIVATISATION

by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

SUMMARY AND nCI  ENDATION

The British Ley^A^^^L) Board have now completed their assessment of the proposals from th^^np prospective purchasers and of the option of retaining the busiJK^with BL within a view to a later flotation or trade sale. On financE^and industrial grounds, the Board have recommended retentio^^ri^B^ BL.

2.	I recommend that the Board&apos;s proposal should be accepted. It would result in proceeds for BL which reflect the hoped for improvement in Land Rover&apos;s performance; would provide a period of stability for BL and, in the interim, would allow profits from the businesses concerned to help sustain BL&apos;s commercial vehiclejog^fc^ations whilst solutions are sought, in particular, for Leyland Trucks

3.	Subject to colleagues&apos; views^^^^Sonose to make a statement to the

House on 24 April on the lines of	at Annex A.

   | 5# xhe JCB and Aveling Barford proposals are considerably inferior to Athe two other proposals and were therefore rejected by the BL Board. Not ^Inly are the total receipts by BL likely to be less than in the other cases but, more important, the initial proceeds are very low (in both

below the level of Land Rover&apos;s borrowings) and the future receipts ^fcbuU^rary significantly from the figures shown.

6^The Lonrho and Schroder offers are financially very similar. Whilst the initial payments are virtually identical, Schroder&apos;s offer includes a further sum by way of deferred consideration. On the other hand the Schroder offer includes the purchase of Freight Rover, excluded from the Lonrho bid.^fcie Schroder/Management team proposal can, on their own projections, Ipl^expected to produce results for Land Rover and Freight Rover somewhat be1ow those in BL&apos;s 1986 Corporate Plan. The Management buyout would^^K^be operating alone with no recourse to assistance from a parent compan^pflk the BL Board regard as a significant weakness.

Lonrho would ol^l5^ther band   brinS new management, sales and marketing strengths to LandM^ and the Lonrho Group could, if necessary, provide additional fundin^JSgthe choice rested only between these two bids, the BL Board consider	industrial terms, Lonhro would, on balance,

represent the better

7. However, the process of Lonrho and the Schroder/Management proposal are substantially lower than the proceeds BL considers it is likely to receive by retaining the companies and selling, either by flotation or trade sale in about two years&apos; time. Therefore, the BL Board have unanimously and firmly recommende^^iat the four bids should not be pursued. I attach a copy of thAl%  ter at Annex C. The course proposed would allow Land Rover&apos;s improveff^egermance to work through into their profits, so that, by mid-1988, th^j^eds from a flotation of Land Rover would in BL&apos;s view be of the order	million (net present value on a

basis comparable with the other bidsJ. ,	significantly m excess of

the valuation placed on the business b^ tf%existing bidders. These views are shared by Hill Samuel and by BaringT^K^Government s financial advisers). Nor would flotation be the oiKdRkion for BL - improvements in Land Rover performance could also produ^^ much wider range of potential trade purchases.

8.	Deferred privatisation would not complicate the wider problems facing BL The Board believe that disposal now would emphasise the isolation of_ Levland Trucks, reduce its credibility and further weaken the company. Retention of Land Rover would provide a period of stability for Land Rover-Ley land and allow it to be sustained by contin^irff^renue from the Land Rover/Freight Rover operations.


   


   *Q. I recommend that we accept the Board&apos;s conclusions which are soundly     based. If colleagues agree I propose to make a statement in the House

   ANNEX A

DRAFT STATEMENT

When I made my statement to the House on 25 March following the ending of the talks between BL and GM on the privatisation of the main Land Rover-Leyland businesses, I made it clear that BL would continue to study alternative ways forward for all the businesses concerned. In the particular case of Land Rover and Freight Rover, BL asked for proposals to be made by 15 April. As the House is aware, four proposals were received. These were from Aveling Barford in respect of Land Rover and Range

Rover; J C Bamford in respect of Land Rover, Range Rover and possibly Freight Rover; Lonrho in respect of Land Rover and Range Rover; Schroders (acting for a management and institutional consortium) for Land Rover, Range Rover and Freight Rover.

The BL Board have carefully considered these proposals and they have weighed them against the option of retaining Land Rover and Freight Rover within BL for a possible flotation or trade sale at a later date. The Board have concluded, on both commercial and industrial grounds, that retention of the businesses within BL pending a later sale presents a more attractive option for BL than any of the bids which have been received. The Board have therefore recommended to the Government - and the Government have accepted their recommendation - that none of the bids be pursued and that the companies be retained within BL while preparations for future privatisation are made.

I hope that the continuing speculation about the future of


   


   these businesses will now come to an end and that the BL Board, its management and its workforce can be allowed to concentrate on the serious task of assuring profitable growth and preparing the businesses for privatisation.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 23 April 1986

The Rt Hon Paul Channon MP Secretary of State Department of Trade and Industry 1 Victoria Street London SWl

As its meeting held yesterday 22 April the BL Board (excluding, of course, Mr D R G Andrews because of a conflict of interest) decided that it was in the best interests of BL that the offers for Land Rover and (in one case) Land Rover and Freight Rover be rejected and the companies retained in BL, with privatisation to take place in about two years time. Accordingly, the Board recommends that course of action to Government.

The main reasons for reaching the conclusion are:-

o Of the four proposals received, two (Aveling

Barford and JCB), were so inferior financially to the other two that they could not seriously be entertained.

o The others, from Schroder/Management and Lonrho (the latter being only for Land Rover), are financially roughly comparable in value.

However, the proceeds are substantially lower than the proceeds which BL is likely to receive by retaining the companies and selling, either by flotation or trade sale, in about two years time.

   This assessment takes account of future uncertainties. Thus, if flotation is precluded for any reason, even a modest improvement in performance would make it highly probable that more and stronger trade purchasers than have come forward now would then have a serious interest and they would pay a considerably higher price. The higher proceeds from a trade sale, which in any case may be desirable to give Land Rover the necessary industrial and financial support for long term viability, would overcome any deterioration in Stock Market conditions.

The Schroder/Management proposal envisages flotation in about two years in order to provide the necessary finance for future investment; to provide the institutions with a profit on their investment, and to enable the consortium then to pay BL the balance of the purchase price. It is clearly in the best interests of BL that all the proceeds should come to BL and its shareholders.

Industrially, neither Schroder/Management nor Lonrho has the potential to add significantly to Land Rover&apos;s strength, compared with retention in BL. Its sale now is not justifiable, therefore, on industrial grounds.

BL must take all possible actions to give Leyland Trucks a sound future. The only practical course seems to be sale to, or wide collaboration with, one or more other manufacturers. The availability of Freight Rover and Land Rover would improve the chances of deal significantly.

Selling Land Rover and Freight Rover now would emphasise the isolation of Leyland Trucks, reduce its credibility and further weaken the company. On the other hand retention would be the best way of providing a much needed period of greater stability for the whole enterprise. The importance of these points cannot be over-stressed.


   


   The meeting was unanimous in its very strong belief that the decision is the right one for BL and I was specifically asked to convey this to you. Mr Day has been consulted and although as it happened, he was not able to taka part in th6 Board   s dalibarationsr ha has said ha does not in any way feel uncomfortable with the decision.
