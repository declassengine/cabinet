1986 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY    	Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury

  s    

The report^Sgjge baseline for the 1986 Survey, covering both expenditure	incurred and the outputs and performance to be

achieved, was\fcrcMated on 30 May. Colleagues have also completed an examination of ^Btjir programmes and where they are seeking additional provision, have	proposals to me. I have circulated a summary

of departmental bids^^By minute to the Prime Minister of 10 July. This paper examines the iko^kcts for public expenditure and makes proposals for the next stage oi^K^Survey.

2.	In recent years it has been the practice to consider the prospects for local authority current expenditure separately in the Sub-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy (E(LA)) an&lt;Wthe aggregate objectives for nationalised industry extern^ fin^cing limits to be considered at a separate meeting of the Sub   Com^^ttee on Economic Affairs of the Ministerial Steering Committee ^^^   aomic strategy (E(A)). This year I believe it would be helpful, in ^nR  ring the overall objective for public spending, to take into acco^k^Ae position reached on local authority expenditure; and to set th^Wbjjpctives for the nationalised industries as part of the wider picture.Lord President of the Council will be circulating separately a progress report on the discussions in E(LA). On nationalised ^Q^us  ^es, Departments have already received copies of the Investment &lt;and^inancing Review (IFR).

The position is further discussed in paragraph 12 below.

EXPENDITURE BASELINE

3.	For 1987-88 and 1988-89 the baselines for indW^fcial programmes have been the figures in the 1986 public expendituAjwUe Paper (Cmnd 9702) plus the changes announced in the Budg&lt;^    c|PKmployment measures, together with a few minor technical adjustdfcW^^For 1989-90 we agreed to construct the baseline for individual proytafMfcs by adding 2i per cent to the provision for 1988-89, but consideraOion^f the aggregate planning total figure for that year was left un^ij^^w.


   PROPOSALS FOR EXPENDITURE

4.	In my minute to the Prime Minister of 6 February I urged Departments to &quot;live within their existing baselines with pressures for

) extra resources met by cutbacks elsewhere and - of particular ^^portance - improvements in efficiency and effectiveness&quot;. Although ^SjLleagues were asked to scrutinise personally priorities within their ^pij^ammes, I regret to say that substantial additional bids have been ^[^Torward, full details of which were set out in my minute of 10 July. It is very disappointing that so few offsetting savings were identified and that bids were not in general supported by statements of objectives. In my bilaterals I shall be pressing colleagues further on the setting of targets and the measures on which subsequent evaluation would be based. Lttfk clear that the bids made are far in excess of what can be accommod*  T  d that the problem of establishing priorities in the Survey win tiii  *efore be severe.

5.	Firm conj^ro^fcpf public spending is central to our economic policy. It is an esse^jtej^art of our efforts to improve the performance of the economy, and th0^|Bppects for both output and jobs, by limiting the role of the state^Hf^nabling us to reduce the burden of public borrowing and taxatiH^^k It has played an indispensable part in bringing inflation to the lo\%^: level for 19 years. Moreover it is largely because of these achiq^nShts, coupled with the reputation we have established for prudent financial management, that we succeeded in weathering both the miners&apos; strike and the collapse in oil prices without any financial crisis. Over the past year both long and short-term interest rates have fallen by per cent, but further progress is critically dependeatffco our retaining the confidence of financial markets.

6.	If we are not to put all thifc^^tisk, it is essential that in the

Survey we once again work within th^^Msting and published planning totals for 1987-88 and 1988-89.	Fo^^|^90 we agreed to set the uplift

for individual programmes a little be^^^^se rate of inflation of 3 per cent assumed for that year in the Mediu^^Sihm Financial Strategy. I propose that we now confirm that the pla^pw^total should rise by 3 per cent. This will allow a margin for the a^Qstment of priorities between programmes. This gives broad planning tota^^^^r the three years of   144 billion,   149 billion and   153 billion.

RESERVES

7.	In the White Paper, Reserves of   4i billion,   6^ip^&gt;illion and

  8 billion were set for the three years of the planAm^hires which were large compared with those set in previous White PapewK^fcn the current year it is already clear that the Reserve of   4i billj^Pj^^ be under extreme pressure. I must, therefore, treat all applica^icB^^fcfor access to the Reserve in the current year most strictly and seel^^^^gues&apos; co-operation in ensuring that cost increases are absorbed underspendings surrendered.


   8.	The precise level of the Reserves required for future years depends in part on the decisions taken on programmes during the course of the Survey. If, for example, provision made in programmes is as realisitc as possible, lower Reserves can be set than if, as was the case with

I local authorities in the last Survey, provision is made on a notional flkhasis. I propose, therefore, to consider the precise level of the y^sprvpa later in the Survey, but we must leave, within the public W ^J^nditure totals, scope for Reserves which are fully adequate, rising ^Kirough the period and credible to the financial markets.

PRIVATISATION PROCEEDS

9.	During the course of the last Survey the projections for

priVai-itJnkn proceeds were raised from   2^/4 billion to   4^/4 billion.

I indicf|ljj#^to my minute of 6 February that the privatisation programme was now^5^B^gear and that additions to the level of proceeds could not be exj^urad. Although preparations for the British Gas Corporation sale are pro^^recning well, and other issues are being worked upon, there is no scope ^^reaeipts to be significantly further increased.

Moreover, the ^I^Aaised by these issues will depend very much on market condition^^whtch in turn will be strongly influenced by the outcome of the Su^RkrJk

NATIONALISED INDUSTR^^*

10.	I have circulated separately the officials&apos; report on the

1986 IFR of the nationalised industries. This shows that the industries&apos; own initial and unamended bids, made in April, are over the baseline by approximately   85^tf^Llion,   750 million and   575 million in each of the three years resp^^p^iy. These bids are clearly unrealistic and cannot be accoS^^^d. They now need to be scrutinised rigorously and a number of indu*^^^^are revising their proposals so that we will have a sounder basis f o,^  udging them. In the meantime we cannot take a firm view on the lil^^^|^rall outcome, but our aim must to be reduce the provision at least ^0^^  eline and, where we can, below it. Failure to achieve this would	pressure on departmental

programmes.

RUNNING COSTS AND MANPOWER

11.	Additional bids for increases in provision for running costs amount to over   550 million in 1987-88 and higher sums for later years. If they were conceded the increase in total running costs expenditure would be more than 6i per cent on a year earlier, very substantially in excess of the present and expected rate of inflation. In^^^g of this order would scarcely demonstrate our intention to contro^wpenditure on departmental administration.

12.	A significant part of this increase is accounted fo^^^^dditional bids for pay. But any real increases in pay must be matched growing productivity if the overall rise in departmental costs is TcBKgkept close to the rise in prices in the economy generally. Depa^pjg   should be planning the measures necessary to achieve this.


   13.	Another large part of the increase claimed for running costs is accounted for by bids for additional manpower. Colleagues will know

  from the minute 1 sent to the Prime Minister of 17 February that we must keep a very tight rein on manpower numbers if we are to hold to our published manpower targets. The position now is that if the additional ^jLrmhoT-g sought by Departments were agreed, the target of 590,400 staff April 1988 would be exceeded by 14,000, reversing the downward trend achieved since we took office.

14.	1 must therefore ask colleagues to re-examine their departmental

programmes with a view to reducing the increase in running costs to much more modest levels and to keeping at or below their manpower targets.

CONCLUSIft^%

15.	I invitefeJplleagues to agree:

a. thajfl should now conduct bilateral discussions with colleaguS%3(kheir individual public expenditure programmes; and on their t^R|  |p for running costs and manpower;

b. that ondB^feo we work within the existing and published public expendicKe planning totals of   144 billion and   149 billion for 1987-88 and ^58*^9 respectively, and   153 billion for 1989-90;

c.	that we should aim to hold the provision for nationalised industries at least to baseline and where possible below that;

d.	that we should seek A^^strain the growth of running costs and that existing manpow^ ta^^ts should be held.
