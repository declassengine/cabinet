DISSOLUTION OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY /M^errandum by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland

\ -----------------------------

INTRODUCTION

On 9 June the De^  Wfe and Oversea Policy Committee (OD) considered my proposal that thA_JjQ  hern Ireland Assembly should be dissolved. This memorandum seeks tMe^Cajbinet &apos; s confirmation of the Committee&apos;s conclusions.

BACKGROUND

2.	The Northern Ireland A4#feiqbly reaches the end of its four year term on 20 October. On expiryX^sro^ection will automatically follow within six weeks unless action is &apos;^kpp&apos;*before then to dissolve it. While we wish to see a new Assembly (whrici^ould include the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP)) and there^pte^ant a new election, I believe it could be disastrous to be tied to thi  /oap?  jLcular timing. The first anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will^^AVithin the election campaign and the whole of it would be used by un^ujfts (as they used the 15 Parliamentary by-elections) as a major^vgnt to revive what is otherwise a rather flagging campaign against the ^^oient. Moreover in the build-up to this election there would be no prosp^t/bf serious talks about devolution.

3.	The two unionist parties would almost certainly fight on a joint anti-Agreement ticket. The SDLP, faced with an Assembly certain to be dominated by unionists hostile to the Agreement/atT&amp;Nuninterested in constructive work, might decide not to run; or \  f rjiey did run, not to sit. The Alliance Party would have grave reservations)about participation. If the Ulster Unionist Party/Demoo^a&amp;i^NUnionist Party (UUP/DUP) did not fight on a joint ticket and stood ^w/pit each other, the prospects are, given present divisions in the UUP/&apos;Wiah there would be substantial gains by the DUP at their expense; this wot&lt;id^&apos;k   arly make things even more difficult.

4.	OD supported my proposal to dissolve the Assembly to e^e&lt;upr\that we

do not face automatic .re-election later in the year. That t^0  or$ises the question as to when this dissolution should take place.	yy)


   5.	Within Northern Ireland there is considerable surprise in responsible circles that we have allowed the Assembly to go on for so long. For a

. number of months it has refused to perform its statutory functions, which &apos;&apos;\are to consider how to achieve devolution and to operate Committees to ^scrutinise the work of Northern Ireland Departments. The Assembly instead VM6 indulged in anti-Agreement propaganda and publicity stunts. At &apos;VVriifeent its only business is one afternoon debate per week which consists &apos;&apos;^of^jdn.atribes against the Agreement. These are only attended by Unionists wirp^he DUP taking the leading role. The Alliance members have long srortfe^Akparted in disgust, and indeed the Alliance leader, John Cushnahan, beli^tfes^strongly that the Assembly should now be dissolved, in spite of finane^Q^implications for him and his members. Privilege is abused by Memberi^^taming individuals such as civil servants who are members of the Secretarq/ai^Government contractors, and others who they brand as &quot;quislinj#^. There are repeated personal attacks on the Chief Constable and denigrations of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) as a force. In general, the Assembly is encouraging instability rather than acting as a safety valve. Imi^ed it was to the Assembly that the unionist leaders went, after retryCtTng from the understanding reached with the Prime Minister on 25	to throw their weight behind the 3 March &quot;Day of

Action&quot; which saw wicmViolence. The latest antic of the Assembly was for some twenty Member s^ro^dfccupy the Stormont telephone exchange (which also serves Government Degjimrajerpts) until they were ejected by the RUC. As long as they have accesv^    \the Assembly precincts within Parliament Buildings it is difficu^&apos;^o^protect others who work in the building, including Ministers, from   ^afssment.

6.	For some time therefor^M^Covernment has been seen in Northern

Ireland to be exercising rematf  nrole tolerance in allowing the Assembly to carry on - and in continuing Jfonance it and pay its Members to the tune of   2.8 million per annum. The^CYp^L as its Accounting Officer, is on increasingly thin ice in terms ofvjus,ep  ying that expenditure. I have already publicly warned about the TQgK&amp;yto the continuance of the Assembly from the failure to discharge their f&lt;  frcj  jLons. Two weeks ago I invited the leaders of the main Unionist parttSi^o discuss the present position. Their refusal to meet me does defend us/kWrtist any complaints of lack of consultation in any decision which we clwrose to take. In addition the leader of the UUP, James Molyneaux, has noW made clear that most of his Assembly members expect it to be dissolved, and he expressed no great regrets about its departure.	_

TIMING

7.	I have sought in the opening paragraphs to exg^Mr^the importance of

dissolution so that we are not tied to an automatic ^eTM^lection. This requires an Order in Council subject to affirmative r^awWKion in both Houses. It would have to be approved before the Reces^f^^cannot wait until the spill-over) and it would be undesirable for debjM^&apos;On it to coincide with the height of the marching season in mid-J	therefore

propose that the Dissolution Order should be debated alongs^d^^Xe Order renewing the &quot;interim period&quot; of direct rule for a further yMi&amp;&apos;vThe latter Order has already been laid and is usually debated mia^a^and June. This would mean laying the Dissolution Order as soon as possib


   8.	For the reasons I have given in paragraphs 4 and 5, I believe that it should come into effect without delay. If we merely announce that

\ dissolution will take effect sometime ahead, that will encourage the ^Assembly to maximise the mischief it makes in the time remaining to it. I yftave considered carefully whether the absence of the Assembly over the ing season might add to our troubles. Undoubtedly unionist ypyw^aganda will have it that by dissolving the Assembly we are stifling vtira/yflemocratic voice and forcing politics onto the streets. In fact, for rfut^iksons I have described, I believe that the continuation of the Assiamt^tX would, if anything, make matters worse, not least since I happen to k*row/  hat they are planning not to go into recess on 10 July, but instea^t^tnaintain the Assembly through the marching season.

PRESENTA4^   F$r

9.	I would propose to announce a decision to dissolve by way of an Oral Statement to the House to accompany the laying of the Dissolution Order.

I would argue tha  -~the present Assembly, for a number of months, has been refusing to disdVargfe the functions for which Parliament established it and for which it  cjj&amp;S&apos;_authorised funds, but instead has concentrated on attacking the Angl/y^IrMsh Agreement, which is not part of its functions; that the leaders oKlAe^arties had refused to come and discuss the position with me; an^^OT^i^ there could no longer be a justification for expenditure for purpos4^v0^Ally removed from the original concept of the Assembly. This decisiow&apos;m^epi provoke some disorder, for which the unionists would blame the^^^^nment, but politicians have been seen on the streets in recent months&apos;; Assembly or no.

10.	I would at the same tim^rfJa^e^clear that I am announcing not the

abolition of the Assembly, pre^fen^or future, but simply the dissolution of the present Assembly and tharY^^Sovernment remains committed to achieving devolved Government an&lt;KYhp^Swe shall seek elections for a new Assembly as soon as practicable. IfeYhurfc would be said which could encourage a belief that the Governme^^oadd consider greater integration of the Province into the United Kingd	would emphasise our desire to

see a new election at the earliest possqAl^opportunity; and our determination to take all possible steps\xo establish the political conditions in which they could be held. rb that end, I would make it clear that the Government remains willing to talk to the unionists about the four matters on which the Prime Minister had^affered them a dialogue in her letter of 25 February, namely devolutiot//  na\the possibility of a round table conference, the future of the AssenH^v-fehe handling of Northern Ireland business at Westminster, and new/iem of consultation between the Government and unionist leaders. I wotfct^ifephasise my readiness to discuss with all the party leaders, inoC&amp;qforg the SDLP, how best a constructive dialogue could begin. In the mea^K^c. in place of institutionalised consultation with the parties throug^fc^^Assembly, I would seek through correspondence to continue to consult t^Mt\about on-going Government business, including proposals for legratanion.


   11.	Thus I would seek to present dissolution as positively as possible.

V In annoucing the decision, I would look forward to a new Assembly, which would conduct constructive business, in which representatives of both ^vcommunities would feel able to participate, and which might pave the way restoration of devolved Government.

WW^BkUSION

13/o^iynn in no doubt that the Assembly must go and that is should be soone^f^ther than later. The longer that it continues in its inflamm^ory ways, the more encouragement it gives to irresponsible forces as th^ma^^iing season approaches. OD agreed, subject to clarification of legal anoyPaa^.iamentary points, on which I shall report orally, that it would be^mgnt to do so quickly. I therefore invite colleagues&apos; agreement thatT&quot;&quot;   !

1.	I should lay a Dissolution Order after Cabinet on 12 June.

2.	I shovnd n^ke a statement in the House that afternoon announcing not the abor-J^paS^of the Assembly, present or future, but simply the dissolution of(tl)A/Dresent Assembly and that the Government remains committed to achrj^^fng devolved Government and that we shall seek elections for a &apos;iie^^&amp;sembly as soon as practicable;

3.	The Dissolution trader should be debated alongside the Direct

Rule Renewal Order	s possible and be made at a Privy Council

immediately thereaftew^//.

4.	Dissolution should Mdc  effect immediately after the Order has been made at Privy Counci
