ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

Events this year/^Z  . turning out rather differently from the prospect foreseen at the/cim^jof the Budget. The fall in inflation - both worldwide and in^Ih^lhsited Kingdom - has gone further than expected. But output has grown mwre i/lowly, as the initial unfavourable effect of the oil price fall has &apos;fee^fa^superimposed on a temporary pause in activity worldwide, with inev&amp;aW^ consequences for unemployment.

2.	Although there is   f&apos;wjkno sign of it, a resumption of growth both abroad and at home still Ltf  ra\likely later this year, as the benefits to economic activity from low^^ovl prices begin to make themselves felt.

But in the light of our exp&amp;fcfe  s^ so far this year we cannot afford to take chances. And however th^i^^pects of world growth turn out, we face two particular threats at home^y^h^ failure of pay settlements to respond to sharply lower inflation, andMfUjM&amp;essure for higher public spending, against the background of a fiscasl^&apos;po^ption still vulnerable to the oil price which currently stands at	a barrel as compared with the

$15 a barrel assumed at the time of fch/e&apos;^Bjidget.

WORLD ECONOMY

3.	Activity in the world economy was generally sluggish in the first quarter of 1986. There was a small fall in manufacturing output in Japan and much of Europe, and in the United States growth has been modest.

Demand from outside the industrialised countries^Jrak also been weak, with a substantial reduction in imports by oil-produoingvcountries.

4.	With the collapse in oil prices and the contimjjjWe^effeet of the

prudent financial policies pursued by all the major   TiaiMjns in recent years, there has been a further sharp fall in inflatioflft^psonsumer prices in the major industrialised countries have risen on	only 2 per

cent over the past year. The consequent increases in real^jrfptomes, together with lower interest rates, should ensure a resumjW^pnXof reasonably vigorous growth, perhaps later this year.

   THE BRITISH ECONOMY

P 5. At home, the pattern has been broadly similar. Following its strong ^performance in the four years up to early 1985, output, adjusted for the ^/Soal strike, has since grown more slowly, and is now expected to grow at ^^wjNnore than 2\ per cent in 1986, instead of 3 per cent as forecast at v^Bwget time. The prospect of buoyant consumers&apos; expenditure and better &apos;^  pjfyrLs reflecting the expected upturn in world trade should mean a somejihW stronger increase in activity in 1987 than was envisaged at the timefl^he Budget.

6.	Xj^tjlS.on has fallen steadily for the past few months:	as measured

by the	Price Index it is now down to 2\ per cent. I expect it to

remain lw^imroughout the rest of this year and next year, although there will inevitably be some bounce back from the current artificially low level.

7.	But this faLt   iri inflation has been matched and often surpassed in other industrial/y  eo\countries. Germany and Japan are now enjoying virtually stable\^ji&lt;rB  . Moreover, there are clear signs in our competitor countr i/iftMt the slowdown in price increases is being reflected in lower &apos;eaKK^gs growth; and their unit cost increases are negligible or negati

8.	In the United Kingidfi^&apos;wn the other hand, there is as yet no sign of lower actual and expected iftfj^tion being reflected in lower wage settlements. Earnings so^arane continuing to grow at around 7   per cent per year (as against an inc^^^s^Xn the Tax and Prices Index of little more than \ per cent) implyin^/aX^arp rise in our unit costs and a serious deterioration in our c^mp^Otiveness.

9.	The consequences of this excv^^yev earnings growth are clear. Unemployment, despite all the measq^!^^^ have taken, continues to increase at an average of lO,OOO-15,Q03^  &amp;r month. With a faster expansion of employment as output gro^J^jfcdcks up, and declining labour force growth, the best guess is still tft^L^here will be some improvement in the unemployment position next year. ^But excessive earnings growth is losing us jobs. Furthermore, the loss ofvcompetitiveness on our non-oil trade, superimposed on the deterioration in the oil account, is beginning to make the current account of the balance of payments look vulnerable.

10.	Despite this the financial markets have sc((fawbeen remarkably steady since the Budget. The exchange rate has held pr^rtj  y~yirm in the face of a further fall in oil prices. Base rates have falleAjW/2^ Per cent and long-term rates have fallen to their lowest level siiraf/the early 1970s.

11.	But both nominal and real interest rates remain tf^^hXrojnpared to those of our competitors. The major changes taking placeMjj^financial markets have made the task.of interpreting monetary condi&lt;^fo5*s\very difficult. This has become something of a problem worldwirejyypt it is particularly marked in the United Kingdom. Although narrow m0m|Q^is towards the bottom of its target range, bank lending is expartoiiv^^apidly and broad money and particularly, but not exclusively,   M3 - cqf    ^^p^s to


   grow well beyond expectations. In these circumstances, with no clear guideline for the markets to look at, our approach to interest rates must inevitably remain cautious.

Jjil. Given these uncertainties on the monetary front, the markets are -^^tching even more closely for any evidence of lack of resolution over the of Government borrowing; and with the further fall in the oil price -has been even more pronounced in sterling terms     the fiscal plooks more difficult than at the time of the Budget. As the CMep&apos;irecretary, Treasury&apos;s paper shows, the pressures for higher public speMin  Pare intense and relentless. It will require great determination to ma^&amp;ih the firm control of public expenditure which is central to our econon^bS^tcategy and essential if we are to make further progress in reducin^&gt;^erest rates and avoid increases in the tax burden.

13.	&quot; A summary of the most recent Treasury assessment is shown in the attached annex.

CONCLUSION

14.	The economy W^pl^aen experiencing a pause in the steady growth seen

since the trough ox^go^Yecession in 1981. That pause, which is also occurring in the res^^^^ie industrialised world and has coincided with the collapse of oil pq4^^\is affecting short-term employment prospects. But inflation has been ^Sy&lt;^J:han expected; and the prospect is still for a resumption of growth at	later on this year, as activity worldwide

recovers its momentum. mm

15.	But there are clear dang^rv|j\&gt; Developments in the world economy are inevitably subject to much unokrp       hty, and the failure so far of pay to adjust to sharply lower inflattef^s^ threat to competitiveness, jobs and confidence in the financial marke^S^Xgainst this background, we cannot afford to risk reversing the progr^    wk have made in recent years in reducing the burden of taxation (sti W^iji^her than it was in 1978   79), in reducing borrowing and in holding dowjj^^rtrlation. It is vital, therefore, that we maintain, as the Chief Secretai*/^&gt;easury proposes, firm control of public expenditure.
