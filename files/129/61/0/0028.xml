C. (53) 173 COPY NO.22nd JUNE, 1953.cabinet.V.Memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government.I was not able to attend the last Cabinet, but I have read the minutes ofthe discussion and the proposed new announcement (C. (53) 177).2.      I do not believe that it will be possible to avoid a Debate and a vote inthe House of Commons (or, for that matter, in the House of Lords) if this statement is made.3.     The arguments for retreat are powerful.(a) This is not a matter of high principle, but of the balance of advantage and of political expediency.(b) We can gain a few adherents and may lose many friends.    We areourselves the product of a Coalition, of Tories, Whigs, Liberals,Radicals, and even &quot;Moderate&quot; Socialists, who voted for us in1951.But the Coalition forming against us on this issue is diverse andformidable:   Lords Halifax, Waverley, and Brand represent the combination of forces, Church, Kirk, and Counting&quot;house, whichfinally drove out the Stuarts.(c) It is doubtful whether we can carry our proposal in either House.Yet a defeat on such an issue, when such large events arelooming up all over the world, would be worse than tragic.   Itwould be ridiculous.(d) We can still retreat honourably.We can say with truth that we cannot hope to carry the point witha &quot;free&quot; vote.   We therefore do not think it right to force it through, by an appeal to loyalty or fear, by a &quot;whipped&quot; vote.Remember what we said about Steel Nationalisation, forcedthrough by a majority of six votes.4.     Against this, there are strong arguments the other way,(a)   The party in the House of Commons is overwhelmingly favourable to commercial television.   The Government is committed.
(b) The &quot;man in the street&quot;, once he has paid for the necessaryapparatus and enjoyed the attractions of a choice of programmes,will form the nucleus of a great vested interest in favour of retaining the system.   Several million consumers, putting up astrong resistance to any threat to their amusement, might be a decisive factor at the next Election.(c) After the initial impetus of criticism has spent itself, we shallgain general approval for our resistance to the &quot;spoil-sport&quot;(ecclesiastical or otherwise) and the intellectual snob.   Resolutionwill earn respect.5.     To my mind, in coming to a decision in this balanced argument,everything depends on timing.    For the matter will never be settled by anythingbut practical experience.   Delay will favour the &quot;antis&quot; and their solemn league and covenant.If therefore we decide to go forward, we must do so vigorously.&quot;If it were done - when &apos;tis done - then &quot;twere well it were done quickly. &quot;6.      But how quickly?When can the &quot;converters&quot; be ready?What will they cost and can we spare the labour and materials ?When can the new stations be ready, and the new programmes be launched?How much effort is involved, taken from defence or exports?Can the new system start in the spring of 1954?   or only in the autumn?or, worse still, in the spring of 1955?On the answers to these questions everything depends.Nothing would be worse than a prolonged discussion and agitation with no real demonstration before the Election comes.7.      Unless we can get the new system going within six or nine months, Ishould favour dropping the whole idea, for good and all.We shall certainly have to face an angry Parliamentary Party.   ,3u$,I am not sure that we shall not gain in the long run.H.1VI.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,22nd June, 1953.
