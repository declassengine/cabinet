&apos;a3CONFIDENTIALC.(53) 184 COPY NO. Lj30TH JUNE, 1953CABINETOFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have, as agreed at Cabinet on 24th June (C.C (53) 36th Conclusions,Minute 4),again considered whether any concession could be made without serious damage to the Exchequer.2.        The only one which I can suggest will involve a considerable expenditureof public money, departure from a long-held line of precedent, and legislation in the autumn.    I define what I mean in the  paragraphs below.    My case, quitesimply, is that the small concession asked for by the Minister inevitably leadsus to a position where we cannot resist the larger demands, and that theseinvolve a most undesirable cost.3.        The Minister&apos;s proposal looks modesty itself;   some  210,000 perannum for a small band of senior officers who will not live long to draw theirenhanced pension.    I add as an appendix how this figure is made up.    but unfortunately there is more to it than that.    As my earlier paper (C. (53) 126)showed, at the very least we should have to do as well by the civil servants who retired in the same period.    Their case is as strong as that of the service officers and to meet it adds  360,000 to the bill.4.        Even taking this into account we could face  f million per annum, butI must stress that what is at stake is the principle in our pension system, whichis our only protection against demands which would cost many millions.5.        That principle is that the pensioner gets the pension to which he was entitled when he retired and that we increase that, his contractual, pension only if it clearly reduces him to intolerable need.    That was the essential principleof the increases given by the Coalition Government in 1944 and by all pensions increase measures since.    It was also the principle followed after the firstwar.    Hardship was relieved.    Nothing was done for those whose pension andother income put them outside the need for relief.6.        That is the principle we should throw overboard if we adopted theMinister&apos;s proposals.    True, the principle was compromised in the 1944=1947schemes when increases were given on Civil Service and retired officers&apos;pensions up to  787 10s., with no means test - the so-called &quot;automatic&quot;increases.    But then at least we only revised a contractual pension withouta test of need in a very limited area, which excluded those on the higherpensions, and did so at the same time as increases were given to the lower levels.
7.        If, as I believe, we cannot meet the Service officers&apos; case withoutsimultaneously acting for the Civil Service, we cannot do so without legislation.And at that point, quite inevitably, the demand (for which there has been considerable agitation) will be made, not solely for the 1935 cuts to be restored,but for all pensions to be revised to the still higher levels of pensions grantedto-day.    The only defence against that demand is that pensions arecontractual and that you revise them only to meet need.    If we have jettisonedthat principle we have no defence against a demand, for which much sympathycan be aroused, that public pensions awarded in the past should be regularlyadjusted to the levels of pensions being currently awarded.8.        I can give no accurate estimate of what it would cost to yield to that demand, but I am sure it would cost a great deal.    The revision of pensions to give old pensioners the pensions of those recently retired would go far beyond the Civil Service.    Teachers, Police and Local Government would inevitably have to come in and, as my earlier paper showed, any generaladjustment of Crown pensions makes it impossible to hold war pensions and national Insurance benefits at their current rates.9.        I would suggest therefore that we remit this matter to be furtherinvestigated by all the Departments concerned and take no further decision till the autumn...R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,29TH TUNE, 1953.APPENDIX359 officers who have had no restorationand who would get  95 to  133 (mostlyGeneral officers), say 360 at  120 ............      43,0005-6,000 officers who have had partialrestoration (mostly Lieutenant-Colonels,Colonels and Brigadiers who would get from  16 to  40 but including some whowould get very small amounts), say5,000 at average of  25 each ...    ...    ......    125,000Cost of extending concession to ex-officers of Indian Armed Forces ...    ...    ...    ...     30,000Margin for contingencies.........    ...     12,000TOTAL ...    .........    210,000
