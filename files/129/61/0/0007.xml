(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5- GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 157 COPY NO.   oV&quot;18th MAY, 1953.cabinet british BROADCASTING CORPORATION:PROPOSED STATEMENT ON LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT.Memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe British Broadcasting Corporation (3.B.C,) have planneddevelopment of their services during the 10-year period of their presentCharter.   They are anxious to make a very early public statement about iton the lines of the attached draft.   They feel strongly that some such statementof how the Corporation would wish to discharge their responsibility under the charter is essential for the good of their relations both with the public andwith their own staff.   Moreover, they say they cannot delay the statementmuch longer in view of the widespread discussion and speculation which isalready occurring and of the impossibility of preventing leakages.2. I hope we shall agree that the B.B.C. should make their statementsoon.   It seems unfair that they cannot show signs of life, whereas commercialtelevision interests are keeping themselves well in the public eye.   I see noobjection to the statement itself.   The Corporation would, of course, make itentirely on their own responsibility, but we should have to define our attitude to it pretty soon after its publication, and I think our line should be that theB.B.C. statement was no more than an outline of the Corporation^ ideas;that, as such, we were in general agreement with it and would hope that, as and when decisions had to be taken, circumstances would permit us to furthersome such development.   It should, of course, be made very clear that this measure of agreement does not in any way commit us on such matters as providing finance, or authorising capital investment, agreeing to a secondprogramme, or meeting the technical requirements for an extension of television.3. It is perhaps too early to discuss in detail the financing of the10-year plan.   The Corporation has sufficient funds for the present financialyear, even allowing for the further development which the Cabinet Committeeon Television Development has recommended.   More will be required for1954-5 and I shall later on be bringing proposals to the Cabinet about this.D.Post Office -Headquarters, E.C.1.18th May, 1953.
ANNEXOUTLINE OF STATEMENT OF B.B.G. PLANSThe Corporation was given a new Charter for ten years on 1st Julylast and has been giving careful consideration to the way in which it should develop its services during this period.    There are many uncertain factors,but the Corporation believes that it should have a long-term plan which itwill strive to carry out in the interests of listeners and viewers,    Completiorof the plan in the ten years will depend upon the resources made available tothe Corporation, and on the relaxation in good time of the present Governmentrestrictions on capital expenditure.    The following are the outlines of theplani -Television - The Development of the First service.       The Corporation at present has five high-power television stations in operation;  plans for the erection of five medium-power stations are ready but the Government have only found it possible to authorise theerection of two of them    on a temporary basis.    The Lime Grove studiosat Shepherd&apos;s Bush have been developed and three regional outside broad-casting units are in action.    The Television Service is on the air for anaverage of five hours a day, though whenever there are important outsidebroadcasts in the daytime these hours are considerably increased.3.       The first task would be to complete the five medium-power stationsnow planned;  when this has been done 90 per cent of the population would be within effective reach of the Television Service.    The next step would beto complete national coverage by the rebuilding of the London station with higher power and the erection of a further ten low-power stations.    Thecomplete chain of twenty stations would cover well over 95 per cent of thepopulation of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.4.       Concurrently with the completion of national coverage the presentTelevision Service would be extended by a further two hours a day.Included in this would be the introduction and development of a news service in vision.An Alternative Television services.        When these steps had been taken the single Television service would be highly developed.   Two further problems would then have to be solved;  these are, the provision of an alternative service and thedevelopment of means whereby more programmes can be produced inthe regions both for their own particular audiences and for national viewing.Both of these problems require for their solution the provision of asecond chain of television stations.   It is by no means certain that the frequencies will be made available to the Corporation for this second chain,but if they are it would be developed on the same lines as the first, thatis to say, with the early provision of high-power stations to cover themain centres of population and the later provision of low-power stations to fill in the gaps.   A start with the second chain would be madeconcurrently with the later stages of the completion of national coveragefor the first chain.   The scale of outside broadcasting equipment for the regions would be increased, and simple studio facilities would be provided at regional centres.   Additional facilities would also be provided in London.The second programme would be developed during this period as transmitters
became available, and would build up to a service of five hours a day,thus giving a full alternative in the important evening viewing hours,6.       The requirements of the Corporation for this second television service have been notified in full to the Television Advisory Committee,who will shortly be reporting on the frequency channels available for television.   The Government will then have to decide what channels areto be allocated to the B.B.C.  If there are insufficient channels to permit the Corporation to undertake the full development of a second service the above plan may have to be considerably modified.Colour Television7.       At some point in the course of the ten-year period it may bepossible to introduce colour.   The essential for a colour service is that transmissions in colour should be receivable in black and white on existing sets.   In this way those who do not wish to incur theexpense involved in replacing or adapting receivers will still be able toreceive a complete service as at present.   The introduction of colourdepends upon progress in the technical field and it is too early yet to saywhen a thoroughly satisfactory system will be evolved.   When the time comes the Corporation intends to use colour for a proportion of its programmes, selecting those which will benefit most from this treatment.The majority of programmes throughout the period are likely to remainin black and white, the position in this sense being analogous to thatdeveloped in the film industry.The Sound services.      The Corporation has given careful consideration to the future ofthe existing sound services in the light of the development of television.The best advice available to the Corporation indicates that by the endof the ten-year period there will be about 7 million television sets in thehands of the public.   This is, of course, an approximate figure and maywell be too high or too low depending as it must upon factors which cannotbe certainly foreseen.   When this figure is reached there will still beabout 6 million households in the country equipped with sound-radiosets only.   The Corporation draws two conclusions from these figures:(a)  the statistical position reinforces the evidence from other sourcesthat sound radio will remain of great importance for as long as anyonecan foresee;   (b) measures must be taken to overcome the difficulties inreception of the sound services caused by shortage of medium wavelengthsand by interference from Continental stations.9.        The Corporation considers that it is much too early to take any decisions on the future scope of the sound services.   Later in the perioda modification of the present form of the sound services may be justified,and the situation will be watched.10.        The -public in many parts of the country are conscious of thedifficulty in receiving some of the sound services and of the interferencecoming from continental services working on or near B.B.C. frequencies.There is also the very unsatisfactory arrangement whereby the NorthEast of England and Northern Ireland have to share a frequency and are thus prevented from enjoying to the full their own regional programmes.There is no way of dealing with these unfortunate disabilities except by theintroduction of broadcasts on Very High Frequencies, and if the view of theB.B.C. on this is supported by the Television Advisory Committee, who have
the responsibility for advising on Very High Frequency (V.H.F.) development,the B.3.C. intend to begin the process at an early date.   They already have a V.H.F, station at &quot;Wrotham from which experimental transmissionshave been taking place for some time, and they have made a plan to erect further stations which will gradually fill up the present weak areasof reception and provide an alternative means of reception in many areasof large population.   The V.H.F. network will be a considerable reinforcementrather than a replacement of the long and medium wave networks.   Theintroduction of V.H.F. will be done in close co-operation with the radioindustry.Programme Development11.       The technical developments both for television and sound that have been described above would be accompanied by a progressive development of the standard of the programmes.   It must not be thoughtthat the spread of television will cause a stagnation of thought and actionin sound, and there is ample provision in the plan for improvementcommensurate with the continuing size and importance of the soundaudience.Resources12.        The Corporation will require increased financial resources tocomplete this programme and to meet the general rise in costs that hasalready taken place.   The capital expenditure involved calls for an average over the ten years 50 per cent greater than the level to which theCorporation is now restricted and revenue expenditure in the period mayaverage 60 per cent more than in 1951-52,   There will be a natural increase of revenue due to the growth of television licences.   Thisnatural increase will not, however, be sufficient to finance the whole plan.It is not possible at this stage to say what steps should be, or will be, takenby the Government to provide the money required.   They must decide year by year the amount of capital investment that can be permitted.   From time totime also they must decide the amount to be charged for licences in thelight of the Corporation^ needs, their own expenses and whatevercontribution to the Exchequer they require.   The Corporation can onlyspeak of their own needs.   At present they receive the equivalent ofabout 15/9d. from each sound licence and 3l/6d. from each combinedsound-and-television licence.   The Corporation have calculated that,provided prices do not rise too rapidly, they could hope to carry through thewhole programme without asking for these amounts to be raised at anytime within the ten-year period beyond  1 and  3 respectively.13.       In making these estimates the Corporation has taken full accountof the need for strict economy in operation.   Their desire is to give thelisteners and the viewers the best programme that can be devised, butthey feel it to be their duty in the interests of the public to avoidextravagance, and particularly to keep down as much as possible theadministrative expenses of the whole organisation.Co-operation with the Radio Industry.14.       The Corporation^ development plan will call for the full co-operation of the radio industry.   The Corporation intends to proceed at all stages in consultation with the Radio Industry Council so thatimprovements and extensions will harmonise with the availability of receiving facilities to the public.
