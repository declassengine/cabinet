confidential.(53) 15311TH MAY, 1953COPY NOCA3INETICELAND FISHERIES dispute memorandum by the Minister of state on ISth December, 1952, the Cabinet agreed in principle to refer thedispute to the International Court of Justice (C.C.(52) 106th Conclusions,Minute 6),2.        Subsequently the Foreign Secretary explained in his paper C. (53) 16dated 13th January the reasons which made it undesirable to refer the wholedispute to the Court, arid recommended that the Iceland Government should beasked to agree to a- reference of the Faxa Bay issue only.3,        The Cabinet agreed to this course on 14th January (C.C.(53) 2ndConclusions, Minute 3).4.        The Iceland Government in reply enquired whether, if the Faxa Bayissue were referred to the International Court, the British fishing industry would undertake to withdraw the ban on landings of Iceland fish when the Courthad given judgment.    As the Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet on26th March (C.C.(53) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 6), he and other ministers were told on 25th March by representatives of the. Eritish fishing industry thatthey were not prepared to give such an undertaking.    The Iceland Governmentthereupon refused in effect to agree to a reference to the International Court,as is shown by the annexed copy of the exchange of letters between the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs and the Iceland Minister.5.        In anticipation of the Iceland Governments refusal to agree to a reference to the International Court without an undertaking that the ban wouldbe removed as soon as&apos;the Court had given judgment, Ministers agreed on27th March to place the dispute on the agenda of the first meeting of thePermanent Commission which has been set up under the Overfishing Convention.The Commission agreed at its meeting on 8th May that the InternationalCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea should be asked to arrange for the study of various conservation problems, among them that of conserving fish stocks in Northern waters, including waters in the neighbourhood of Iceland.    TheCouncil will be asked to advise the Commission of the results of its studies.conclusion.       A complete impasse has been reached.    The latest information fromGrimsby suggests that the British trawler owners and skippers are likely tobe as firm as ever in their stand.    They are deeply concerned not Only thatIceland has not shown herself prepared to make the least concession, but alsothat British-landings from distant fishing grounds (including the grounds around .Iceland where fishing conditions are exceptionally favourable this year) areheavy and are associated with slack markets in this country, with the result
that prices are low and, in general, unremunerative.    They are also concerned at the declared intention of Mr. George Dawson, a Britishfinancier, to sell Iceland fish on the British market in defiance of theban.According to a press report on 11th May, Mr. Dawson has now signed a contract with the Iceland Trawler Owners Association, the President ofwhich is reported to have stated that Mr. Dawson has been granted a concession for a number of years.    Mr. Dawson has already been toGrimsby to discuss arrangements with the docks authorities for landingfish there. .7. -     On the other hand, there is no possibility of persuading the iceland government to modify their attitude until after the general election in June.There is therefore nothing to be gained for the present in attempting to persuade either party to agree to a compromise; nor is there any effective means of coercing either the Iceland Government or the British fishing industry.Re commendations8.       I accordingly recommend that a further communication should bemade to the Iceland Government, pointing out that Her Majesty*s Governmenthave made repeated attempts to bring about a settlement pf the dispute andthat each time the proposals have been rejected or frustrated by the iceland government.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already made it clear tothe Iceland Government that they cannot guarantee that the landings ban willbe lifted when the International Court.has ruled and they do hot, for thepresent, propose to take any further initiative and that it is for the iceland government to make some constructive proposal.    The point of this is thatthe record must be completed before we can make a statement in Parliament;We can afford to wait on an initiative from the Iceland Government becausethe Icelanders do not normally sell their fish here in the summer.    the communication to the Iceland Government would be followed by a statement in Parliament on similar lines in order to make clear the position of .Her Majesty&apos;s Government. . .Foreign Office, S.W.L11TH MAY, 1953.ANNEXForeign Office, S.W.1.31st March, 1953 .When you called on me yesterday, you asked me to confirm inwriting the proposal relating to the fisheries dispute which I made to youon 20th January.This proposal was that, in order to secure an early decision ona clear-cut and straight-forward issue, Her Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Icelandic Government should agree to refer to the International Courtof Justice the question whether the Icelandic Government are entitled
under International Law to use the line drawn across the Faxa-Floi by article 1 of the Regulations issued by the Icelandic Minister of Fisherieson 19th March, 1952, namely the line Eldeyjardrangur (Point 39) -Galuvikurtangi (Point 40), as a base line from which to measure theirexclusive fishery limits.In the course of our conversation I made it clear that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment naturally retained their point of view with regard to all theother limits, which was set  out in the Notes which had been addressed tothe Icelandic Government last year.    . . &apos;If the Icelandic Government agree to the proposal of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be happy to discuss with arepresentative of the Icelandic Government the form of the Special Agree-ment under which the issue shall be submitted to the International Court.(Signed) ANTHONY NUTTINGHis&apos;ExcellencyMonsieur Aghar Kl.
