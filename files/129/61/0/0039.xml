Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1953SECRETC. (53) 1896th July, 1953CABINETTHE &quot;SVERDLOV&quot;Memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyAt the time of the Naval Review the Prime Minister suggested that I mightcirculate to the Cabinet our impressions of the Russian cruiser Sverdlov during hervisit to Spithead and I now do so. Three Flag Officers went on board her andalso a number of liaison officers. At least one of the latter had made a close study of all our previous intelligence reports about her.J. P. L. T.Admiralty, S.W. 1,2nd July, 1953.The Sverdlov arrived at Spithead on 10th June and left on 16th June. She isestimated to be a ship of 17,500 tons displacement.State of vessel generally2. Clean, smart and efficient. Meticulous care with outward appearances.Conventional and obsolescent radar aerials only visible; up-to-date equipment dis-mounted or covered. Large range finders on directors. Mine rails on Quarterdeck. Ship&apos;s boats were well designed, well fitted and well found.Seamanship3. Ship handling excellent. Entering harbour procedure was meticulous and ship moored in accurate station with minimum waste of time and fuss. Dressingship and salute firing were well done. Her boats were handled, however, in aninexperienced manner and with no consideration for others.Ceremonial4. This was generally good. Her Guard was smart in appearance but theirstandard of drill and that of the Ship&apos;s Company when fallen in was imprecise.Manning and cheering ship was good in the event but much pressure was needed on the part of the R.N. Liaison Officers to get them to rehearse the procedure ofcheering ship. Her hospitality was overwhelming!Behaviour of Ship&apos;s Company both on board and ashore5. On board the Ship&apos;s Company looked fit, young, healthy and were fault-lessly dressed. She carried a very large complement by R.N. standards. Ashorethe ratings were clean, smart and carried themselves well. They were always inorganised parties and little personal contact was achieved. The officers appearedanxious to fulfil their social commitments but were awkward at first. They onlyattended official parties.Copy No.44448
Relations with Shore Authorities6. These were very limited but were quite cordial when established. an invitation from the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth to a special showing of a film ofthe Coronation was accepted and apparently appreciated. It was noticeable at the coronation Naval Review Dinner and Ball that the officers had strict orders regard-ing their conduct. They did not like being separated and were frightened of appear-ing to enjoy themselves. Some in authority were observed to rebuke deviation fromthe &quot; party line.&quot; In spite of these difficulties a number of them appeared to.enjoythemselves from time to time. The Mayors of Gosport and Portsmouth wereofficially received on board. A party of Press men was allowed on board apparentlyby prior arrangement with the Soviet Embassy. Also, apparently by prior arrange-ment, a number of civilian guests were entertained on board.How the &quot; Sverdlov &quot; compares with R.N. Cruisers7. The general impression gained was that she compared favourably with R..N. cruisers. She is bigger, more powerful and likely to be much faster. Sheappeared to be more heavily armed and armoured than R.N. cruisers, but herarmament control is probably not so good as ours. It was quite evident that theRussians were out to make a favourable impression. The officers did not appearto be as able tactically as their British counterparts but they have a good ship andknow it. She would be an unpleasant threat loose on the trade routes and wouldtake a great deal of bringing to book.The Sverdlov is the first of a class which now numbers fourteen.
