Printed for the Cabinet. July 19537SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 20020th July, 1953CABINETRETAIL PRICE OF SUGARMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of FoodContrary to earlier hopes it has become plain that the sugar subsidy will notbe eliminated without some increase in the Ministry of Food&apos;s selling price for rawsugar. That increase, given existing distributive margins, would raise the retail price of sugar by slightly more than \d. a pound2. We have considered whether we could rely on competition amongdistributors after derationing to absorb the increase in the Ministry&apos;s selling price and thus avoid an increase in the retail price. We have reluctantly reached theconclusion that despite competition the retail price is bound to rise when thesubsidy is eliminated, and that we should be open to criticism if we left it to doso after derationing.3. We therefore recommend that the retail price of sugar should be increasedby \d. a pound from the same date (6th September) as we have proposed for the increases in the retail prices of butter, margarine and cooking fat set out inC. (53) 174. (These latter increases would add 0-44 of a point to the cost-of-living index, and an increase of \d. a pound on sugar would add a further 0-09 ofa point.)4. Although it is not&apos;our intention to continue to control the retail price of sugar after derationing it is our view that competition will be sufficient to restrainretailers from making any further increase in the retail price beyond the \d. a poundwhich we recommend.R. A. B.G. L. G.20th July, 1953.44524
