The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP secret copy NoC.(53) 18329TH JUNE, 1953CABINETTHE REGENCY bill memorandum by the Home secretary i circulate for the approval of my colleagues -(a)A draft Bill to amend the Regency Acts;(b)A draft Message from The Queen;(c)Draft Motions for the Addresses from each house in reply to the Message.The Bill makes provision for(i)  The Duke of Edinburgh to be Regent during the minority of the Sovereign, and also during the incapacity ofThe Queen until one of their children attains the requisiteage (clause l).Clause 1(3) applies only in the case of the incapacity ofThe Queen.    It makes it clear that, for example,Prince Charles, on attaining the requisite age, becomesRegent in the place of the Duke of Edinburgh.Clause 1(4) also applies only in the case of the inca?jacityof The Queen.    It provides, for example, that if the duke of Edinburgh becomes Regent and subsequently PrinceCharles and Princess Anne die when minors,Princess Margaret (being heir apparent) will thereuponbecome Regent in the place of the Duke of Edinburgh.The principle is that the Duke of Edinburgh as Regentstands only in the shoes of the children.    He will,however, as husband remain guardian of The Queersperson.Clause 1(5) deals with the case of the Duke of Edinburghas Regent delegating the royal functions to Counsellorsof State.    Without this provision the incapacitated Queenwould be the first Counsellor of State and the four next in succession would be the four next in succession after the duke of Edinburgh.    It also has the effect of providing that if the Duke of Edinburgh, being Regent for an infantSovereign, marries again and delegates the royal functionhis second wife will not be a Counsellor of State.
(ii)     When one of their children, being the heir apparent orthe heir presumptive, attains the age of 18 years, the child will become Regent in the case of the incapacityof The Queen (clause 2).I desire to draw the special attention of my colleagues tothis provision of the Bill.The main effect of the clause is that, in the case of theincapacity of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh willbecome Regent and will act in that capacity until the duke of Cornwall attains the age of 18 years.    this gives effect to paragraph 6 of the minute from the lord president of the Council to the Prime Minister dated21st May, 1953, which was considered by the Cabinet on27th May.      Under the Regency Act, 1937, the Duke of edinburgh would remain Regent until the Duke of cornwall attained the age of 21.It will be necessary to submit the terms of the RoyalMessage to Her Majesty for approval and, since an alteration of the existing law embodied in the Act of1937 is involved, it will be necessary to call Her Majesty&apos;special attention to the point in order to ensure that itis in accordance with Her Majesty&apos;s wishes;  and, if so,it will be necessary to make specific reference to theproposed alteration of the law in the text of the RoyalMessage.(iii)     The addition of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to the list of persons to be Counsellors of State (clause 3).3.        By virtue of his position as Regent, the Duke of Edinburgh would, inpursuance of Section 5(c) of the Act of 1937, have the guardianship of the sovereign during minority.    By virtue of his position as husband he wouldunder Section 5(b) of the Act have the guardianship of The Queen&apos;s person inthe event of her incapacity.4. In 1937 the Message was delivered to the House of Commons by thePrime Minister who immediately moved the Address in reply: the Bill was introduced the following day.D.M.F,Home Office, S. V/. 1.26TH JUNE, 1953.

lotThe uncertainty of human life leads me to recommend that you should take into consideration the possibility that occasion may arise forperformance of the royal functions by a Regent during a period whilstHis Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall or another child of Myself and my Husband is debarred by tenderness of age from performing them, andthe expediency of providing that during any such period My Husband ifliving should be charged with the performance of the royal functions asRegent and with the guardianship of the person of the Sovereign.    I wouldalso recommend that you should take into consideration the expediency ofproviding that His Pv.oyal Highness the Duke of Cornwall or another child ofMyself and My Husband who is heir apparent or heir presumptive to the throne should be capable of being Regent if he or she has attained the ageof eighteen years.Further it is My desire to put you in mind that it will not under existing law be competent, on occasion arising hereafter for a delegation of royal functions to Counsellors of State, for MIy Mother to be of theCounsellors.    Consideration of the affection and confidence which you andall my people have evinced for and in Her leads me to recommend that you should take into consideration also the expediency of securing to Her theopportunity of rendering as a Counsellor of State further service to you andto them.I shall be prepared to concur with you in any provision for amend-ment of the Regency Acts, 193? and 1943, or other measures which may appear to you necessary or expedient for securing the purposes to whichI have alluded.
