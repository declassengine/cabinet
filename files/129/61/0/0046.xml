COPY NO.KARACHI27th June, 1953.My dear Selwyn Lloyd,While I was in Cairo, I discussed the various aspects of the problempending between Britain and Egypt with General Neguib and his advisers on theone side, and the British Charge&quot;d&apos;Affaires - Mr. Hankey - on the other.    I wasnot able to meet General Robertson as he had not yet returned to Egypt.    I wasassisted in my discussions by my Foreign Minister, who accompanied me duringmy visit to Cairo.My general impression is that the concrete problems can be satisfactorilyresolved through patient and sympathetic handling.     The Egyptian and the Britishpoints of view did not strike me as being irreconcilable.I give below a brief summary of the Egyptian point of view on the out-standing questions that need to be settled.    Certain details were also mentionedbut I need not enter into them here.I may state that when talking to the Egyptians I did not make any suggestion of my own.    Nor did I disclose the British point of view as such,though it was my effort to obtain Egyptian reactions to something of the kind that you had mentioned to me.    In talking to Mr. Hankey also I refrained frommentioning to him what was likely to be the ultimate Egyptian view on eachquestion, though I did try to get his reactions to the points made by the Egyptians.secret.(53) 1967TH JULY, 1953CABINETEGYPTNote by the Acting Secretary of State  or foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached letter which the Minister of State has received from the Prime Minister of Pakistanabout his recent discussions in Cairo with the Egyptians.S.Foreign Office, S. W.T.7TH JULY, 1953.
The problem might be viewed in two broad aspects.    One, the number ofBritish technicians to be left to run the various technical installations at the Base,the period during which Egyptian personnel could be substituted in place ofBritish personnel and the channel through which directives may be communicatedto the technical personnel at the Base.    Secondly, the availability of the Baseduring hostilities.On numbers, the Egyptians pointed out that the Treaty of 1936 authorisesa total force of 10,000.    They say that there has been a serious contravention ofthe Treaty inasmuch as the numbers have swollen to 80,000 according to Britishestimates, and 110,000 according to Egyptian estimates.    It was pointed out thatthe British excuse for increase in the numbers was the threat to the security ofthe Base from Egypt.    They countered that in case of a settlement there will beno such threat left and that even if the Treaty was to be restored in full force,there could only be a total force of 10,000 including armed forces and technical personnel.    To the total of 10,000,technical personnel could bear only a modestproportion.They were, however, ready to consider the demands of the situation asit exists today, and the impression left on my mind was that though they talked of technical personnel in terms of scores and hundreds, they might reconcile them-selves to 8,000 genuine technical personnel in mufti,  armed only with, say,service revolvers, provided they were satisfied that the other arrangements were such that the number would, in no circumstances be exceeded and would be progressively reduced through the substitution of Egyptian personnel.As regards the period during which the substitution could take place,they talked in terms of months, and possibly a year or two.    Again, the impressionleft on my mind was that they might go up to five years, but that it would bedifficult to push them beyond that period.    It may, however, be possible to get an agreement that if at the end of five years, British top experts were still needed,they might be retained up to a number not exceeding 100, but that they would be completely subject to the authority of the Egyptian Government.    They could beretained under contract.The channel of conveying directions proved, as was expected, a moredifficult question.    It was put to the Egyptians that British anxiety naturally wouldbe to secure that there would be no interference with, or modification of thedirectives, and that there should be no delay in communicating them.    Both these factors they appeared to be willing to guarantee.    Their stand was that theywould not seek to interfere in any manner with the directives, but that they mustbe given effect to under their authority.    Here too, I feel that if the guaranteeswith regard to speedy transmission of the directives, without any modificationwhatsoever, are forthcoming, a settlement should be possible.The availability of the Base during hostilities presented the most difficult problem of all.    The Egyptians are willing to subscribe to some suchformula as:   &quot;In case of hostilities, the Base will be available for the purpose ofthe defence and security of Egypt and the territories of its Arab allies&quot;.    It wassuggested to them that progress could perhaps be made on this question if theyomitted the word &quot;Arab&quot; before &quot;allies&quot;.    Their reply was that in that casetheir people would infer that &quot;allies&quot; meant the British and the Americans.    Asthey themselves said that, incase of hostilities, they would have to beg for aid from Britainand the U.S.A.,  it was pointed out that the inference would becorrect and should do them no harm.    In any case, it would be for them to conclude an alliance with any Government they chose, and that no country wouldbecome their ally unless the Egyptians themselves made that choice.
I4AThe argument based on the concessions enjoyed by the Americans in britain, and the British in Belgium, which had been used by Sir Winston Churchill,was pressed, but the Egyptian retort was that the argument was fallacious.They pointed out that Britain and Belgium were already fully sovereign and thatfor them to grant concessions to each other or to another Power, amounted toan exercise of the sovereignty, which they already fully enjoyed.    In Egypt&apos;scase, the Treaty of 1936 constituted, not only a restriction upon Egyptiansovereignty, but was, in fact, a subtraction from it, as Egypt&apos;s independencewas recognised subject to and on condition of the Treaty. Any substitution thattook place, or any arrangements that resulted from the Treaty, would not bea case of exercise by Egypt of its sovereignty, but a continued submission tothe restrictions upon it.    All this, however, was recognised as being somewhatacademic.Both sides recognise that a resumption of conversations should be onan informal basis behind the scenes and that concrete questions should bediscussed item by item and that if the resulting picture holds out hopes of asettlement being concluded, formal negotiations might then be opened.The need of moderation in public pronouncements was repeatedlyemphasised upon the Egyptians.    General Neguib conceded that perhaps on occasion some of his colleagues went a little too far.    His feeling was that ifhopes of a settlement began to mount, the verbal bluster would begin tosubside.    He thought it was unreasonable to expect British moderation inspeech from a people with a completely different background and upbringingwho had only recently assumed the exercise of responsibility and who suffered from extreme sensitiveness on the question.I have thought it worthwhile to put down these impressions on paper and to send them to you as they might possibly prove of some assistance duringthe further stages of negotiations with the Egyptians.With kind regards,Yours sincerely,MOHAMMED AL.IThe Rt. Hon. Selwyn Lloyd,Minister of State.
