The Maltese Prime Minister announced in his Legislative Assembly onUth May that he could not acquiesce in the arrangements made for him by Her?VI jSJkjesty&apos;s Government, and that he himself and two other representatives wouldnot now be able to attend.    The Assembly then passed a resolution, without adivision, on this and connected matters, including cancellation of local Coronation B^BJfestivities.bj3.       The following are the points in dispute.    Dr. Borg Olivier objects to thefacts that (a) his seat in Westminster Abbey will be with the Colonial representa-tives and not with the Prime Ministers of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Ireland,(b) he will not ride in the Prime Ministers&apos; procession to the Abbey, (c) as heH^HJ understands, he will be excluded from other functions which those Prime Ministersare to attend Although, in fact, his aspirations regarding these other functionsH^HJ        have been largely met).    Maltese public opinion is also disturbed because the B^BJ, ^national&quot; Maltese flag (red and white, emblazoned with the George Cross) is toBVB        ie flown in London together with the blue ensign, emblazoned with the badge of?fedta, and not alone, as the sole flag of Malta.I 4.       Miss Mabel Strickland (daughter of the late Lord Strickland, and activein Maltese politics, although not of the Prime Minister&apos;s Party, and the owner ofJlhe &quot;Times of Malta&quot;) flew to London at the week-end to represent the Prime H^HI?MM      .-Minister&apos;s point of view.    According to the account she gave me, a serious stateOf tension has developed amongst all sections of the Maltese population.I 5.       I think that it would be possible to meet the Prime Minister&apos;s demandBVB     ^Kver the flag.    Subject to Her Majesty&apos;s approval, we could agree that only theIped and white flag will be flown here officially at the Coronation.    I should alsoSlope that, even at this late stage, it might be possible to make some gesture over HftWjHHJ      B*e-arranging the seating for Dr. Borg Olivier in the Abbey.    I realise that any HBSBBB     Bftoncession which appears to equate Maltese status with that of Southern Rhodesia BBVJHHJ Sand the Maltese Prime Minister has indicated that he will shortly submit HBVjHHJ      Proposals for transfer of Maltese affairs to the Commonwealth Relations Office)Braises issues of Commonwealth policy.    It also involves the immediate practical B^BflR&gt;roblem that the Chief Minister of Jamaica (Mr. Bustamente) could not be denied BBVJ(jBvhatever privileges were given to Borg Olivier.    But if something is not done to ^^^HBVB    Hneet these demands - and the Maltese Prime Minister has said that complete?^H     acceptance of the point about the flag would not be enough to satisfy him - there ^^^BB^BJ     as a risk of serious incidents in Malta on Coronation Day.    In all this matter, I am B^BflBBa -l- BAyB

BBBj BBHJ^|    I j  |k      TELEGRAM No. 104 OF 13TH MAY FROM THEMINISTER OF STATE FOR COLONIAL AFFAIRS0    TO MALTA (Governor&apos;s Deputy)BBBj                         Personal for the Prime Minister from the Minister of State. BBBjBBBj                         I am sending you this message in the Secretary of State&apos;s absence BBB|BBBj            abroad.    I am distressed to learn that you have stated in your Legislative BBBjBBB Assembly that you do not now propose to accept invitations to attend the Corona- H^HBBBj            tion and connected celebrations here, as you regard arrangements made for yourBBBj            attendance to be unsatisfactory.    I cannot but feel that your statement may have HHJH^H            been based, at least partly, on a misunderstanding of the arrangements for yourBBBj            visit which were in train.    I see that you said that you were being excluded fromBBBj            all occasions in which Commonwealth Prime Ministers would participate.    This BBBjBBBj            is not the case, although I am sure that you understand that the Prime Minister H^HH^H            of Malta does not stand upon precisely the same footing as Prime Ministers of ^HBH^H            the independent Commonwealth countries, and that there are necessarilyH^H            differentiations at certain of the functions.    I think you will agree, however, thatBBBj            rigid comparison with the position of Commonwealth Premiers cannot be BBBJsustained.    We had in our minds a comparison rather with State Premiers in HBBjCommonwealth countries (Australia and Canada) and arrangements made for you HBB, were accordingly similar to those made for them.    They, for example, will not ^HBI ride in the Prime Ministers&apos; procession to and from the Abbey, but will travel HHJI in their own cars.    I should, indeed, have to draw upon this comparison if any ^HBI public explanation became necessary here. H^H2.       When I summarise the arrangements which had been made here for you H^Hand your wife, I think you will realise that we have given a great deal of thought H^H^[ to this, and that we had hoped, and indeed confidently believed, that the arrange- BBjBments, which are certainly not just those for the representatives of Colonial BBjBterritories in general, would accord with your expectations.    The place reserved H^Hfor you and your wife in the Abbey is a very prominent one indeed.    For luncheon H^Hafter the Abbey Service you would have come under arrangements applicable to BBBjI State Premiers and not those applicable to general Colonial representatives. |BBjiArrangements in their final form had also provided for you to have accompanied BBBJthe Secretary of State, with two or three other persons only, to the MorningReception for Commonwealth and Colonial representatives at Buckingham Palace H^HI on 1st June.    You were to be invited to one of the two State Banquets at |BBjaBBBj J Buckingham Palace (functions which Commonwealth Prime Ministers will attend, BBBJH^H         I but for which the Secretary of State proposed, apart from Royal guests, onlyBBBj         I yourself and one other).    You were to have had a special place reserved for you BBBjH^H         I at the St. Paul&apos;s Thanksgiving Service on 9th June, had you wished to attend it, H^HH^H         I among the most important representatives, immediately after the Commonwealth H^HH^H         I Prime Ministers.    You would, of course, also have received invitations to the BBBjBVB         I following functions:- BBBjH^B|                         (a)   Buckingham Palace Garden Party on 28th May. B^BjBBBj                        (b)   Government Evening Reception on 30th May. BBBjHBi    I %              (c)   Buckingham Palace Evening Reception on 5th or HBBBBBj                                12th June. BBBjH -3-
I In addition you were to have been accorded special treatment in respect of B^HBAVJ        ? various important unofficial garden parties in that it will only be possible to? invite a proportion of Colonial representatives to each of these whereas you B^HI were to be invited to all;3.      I cannot help regretting that you have made your statement publicly in B^HB^H        I Malta, as I think that fuller information which we might have been able to provide,BVH        I had you put your difficulties frankly to me, might have satisfied you thatB^BJ        I appropriate recognition was being given to Malta&apos;s constitutional position andI to your own personal status in the arrangements being made for you.    I needI hardly say that all your friends and I myself in particular would greatly regret B^HB^H I it if we do not see you here, and you and other representatives of Malta are not BBflBBfl        I present on this historic occasion.    If you feel that what I have said above enablesB^BJ        I Y u *  review your attitude, the Secretary of State and I will be only too happy. B^BJIII.   TELEGRAM NO. 116 OF 16TH MAY TO THEBJVJ MINISTER OF STATE FOR COLONIAL AFFAIRS BJVJP-VJ I FROM MALTA (O.A.G.) Vfl|| My telegram No. 114.    Coronation. B^HB^BJ Following is personal message for the Minister of State from the B^BJ|    I Prime Minister received here 00.45 hours this morning.B^BJ I thank you for your message of 13th May to which I have given veryB^BJ   I j I careful consideration.    I must first of all observe that I had been soliciting B^HBflfl        I information regarding the matters in question for many weeks, also becauseB^BJ        I the announcements of official arrangements made appearing in the press andB^BJ        I broadcast on the B.B.C. from time to time left no room for doubt that Malta&apos;s B^HB^BJ        I status was being completely ignored.    But I patiently waited and did not think BVJ|       of making any statement or taking any action before official information was| received by me.    In the meantime, incidentally, preparations for the publicB^BJ        | local celebrations on a very grand scale were proceeding apace.    On B^BJB^BJ   H    8th May, 1953, at last the Governor&apos;s Deputy (who, I know, had himself urgedan early reply from your office) wrote to me as follows:-B^BJ   | &quot;i have the honour to refer to your letter No. OPM 544/52of 24th April, on the subject of the arrangements for the B^HB^BJ attendance of yourself and Mrs. Borg Olivier at Her Majesty&apos;sB^BJ   bj Coronation and to inform you that notification has now beenBflfl received that your places for the Westminster Abbey CeremonyB^BJ have been allocated above those for all the representatives ofB^BJ   I the five general communities of the Colonial territories andimmediately after those of the Colonial Rulers.B^flJ &quot;2. As regards the Prime Minister&apos;s procession to the Abbey,this is limited to the Prime Ministers of the member B^BJcountries of the Commonwealth and of Southern Rhodesia, B^BmB^BJ     ^ who have been invited to the Coronation as Royal guests and*B^BJ  I in the circumstances, it has not been found possible to arrange B^BJfor the inclusion of the Prime Minister of Malta.flflfl I 9 m^Lm
Bflfl                     &quot;3. It is further understood that at the reception Hflflarranged for representatives of member countries ofthe Commonwealth overseas on the morning of Monday, B^HJ1st June, the Colonial territories will be represented byBJ           the Secretary of State and two Governors in England at HflflB^HJ                 the time, and that the Royal guests from the Colonial ^^flterritories will not be invited.    There will be no Colonial ^^fl^L^L\   \m I         representatives at the luncheon following.11 ^^flI feel you must agree that the terms of this letter had a distinct tone ^^flfl^HJ      m finality about them, and did not leave any room for misunderstanding. Themore so as the contents of such letter in effect but confirmed the general B^BJinformation already publicly made known and the information conveyed by ^^flprevious despatches received from your office.    My difficulties had frankly ^^fl en made abundantly clear to the Governor and to the Governor&apos;s Deputy both ^^fl ally and in writing, and I had no reason to think, after receiving said letter of fl^H8th May, that it was necessary for me to trouble self.    With only a few moreBflfl   I days to go before 2nd June I felt that people of Malta were entitled to know the BflflBj ue position and Government&apos;s attitude to it, and I can assure you that theB^BJ   I  hole of the people of Malta are one with the Government on this occasion. Yourmessage, I regret to say, proceeds on a complete misconstruction of this BflflI altitude and disregards the very clear terms both of my statement in thelegislative Assembly as well as of my letter to the Governor&apos;s Deputy of; 11th May.    Neither contains any claim that a comparison, rigid or otherwise, ^^flaiould be made between Malta and the independent countries of the Commonwealth. B^BJBflfl   I flka* both emphasise is that, in the view of the Maltese Government, there is no ^^flreason whatever why Malta should not have been assimilated to Northern Ireland ^^flor Southern Rhodesia.    Your message makes no reference to either of theseB^BJ   I. Auntries.    Instead it introduces an entirely novel comparison with the States B^HBflfl   i or .f&gt;rovinces  f certain Commonwealth countries.    Such a comparison may ^^fl| adeed give grounds for complaint to the State Premiers vis-a-vis the PrimeI Minister of Northern Ireland.    But that strengthens rather than weakens Malta&apos;sI iaixns.    Malta&apos;s only official representation was to have been through its B^BJ; arime Minister and your message does not suggest any reason why the treatment ^^flBBfl      g|ven to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and also to the Prime Minister flflflB^BJ   j  of Southern Rhodesia ought not to be given to Malta&apos;s Prime Minister.    I am ^^flgrateful to you for the efforts which it appears you have made on my behalf.    The ^^flI summary of functions to which I would have been invited contained in your messa^differs from the arrangements as intimated to me in the letter of the Governor&apos;s! Ilcputy of 8th May and as appeared from other official sources. But it does B^H1 apt alter the fundamental discrimination which ha.* been made against Malta! aid I therefore regret that it does not enable me to review my attitude. B^HB^BJ   I ilpersonally regret very greatly that circumstances have made it impossible ^^flfor me to be with you and other friends of Malta in London on this historic(fccasion.    But I am sure you will appreciate that this is not simply a personal ^^flmatter concerning myself, but also a matter affecting the honour and status B^flJ!  of my country which I am bound to maintain and uphold.I IV.     (i)     TELEGRAM NO. 115 OF 15TH MAY TO THE HMINISTER OF STATE FOR COLONIAL AFFAIRSB-PJ      _y.OM MALTA (Governor&apos;s Deputy)Bflfl   I fl My telegram No. 114. Coronation,fl^HJ Mabel Strickland saw me this evening.    She has decided to fly tofl^H      London tomorrow Friday, leaving here at 10 a.m. , to do what she can to solve B^HB^HJ      the present impasse.    She will stay at the J.ans&lt;]owxie Club, Berkeley Square,BBfl        aid will no doubt call pn Ministcx- oJf State. BBfljflflfl -5-
2. In view of personal nature of Minister of State&apos;s message, I did notI feel justified in telling her of it.    From what she said, it was clear that she hadI seen Prime Minister after he had received message and that he had said nothingI of it to her.    She had apparently not then decided to fly.    I said that it was upI to the Prime Minister to brief her on latest developments in his attitude, andf 1 urged her to see him again before she left.    This she will do.3. She described at length a discussion she had had with Prime Minister B^BJI about the recent debate.    He recognised, she said, that Hyzler and Mintoff hadBVfl I taken matters much further than he had intended.    He had tried to save the BVflI situation, especially as regards the affront to Her Majesty at the end of theBBB I debate, but it had gone beyond his control. BBB4. She will, no doubt, repeat this in London.    If so, it must be borne inI mind that Prime Minister is obviously not being frank with her or he would haveI mentioned message.   Also, months ago in discussion with Governor he himself B^BJI hinted that unless his wishes were met, provision of funds for celebrations mightI be difficult.    My own view, for what it is worth, shared by people of longerI experience here, is that he exploits her sincere desire to help for his own ends ^BHI and has taken above line primarily with the intention that she shall repeat itI to London.    Other points she mentioned were:-BVfl (i)   Maltese opinion is for the most part behind theB^BJ Prime Minister. B^BJ(ii)    There have been at two cinemas attempts todemonstrate against Coronation background filmshowing Crown Jewels, etc. with shots of HerMajesty and Royal Family.B^BJ (iii)   Local Coronation Committee have been compelledby stoppage of funds to cancel a plan to assembleseveral thousand school children at Floriana onCoronation Day to hear Mass, receive Communionand have a celebration breakfast.(iv)   Archbishop is seriously worried about ServicesB^BJ officially attending Te Deum at Cathedral on lnd June B^Hlest there should be a demonstration against them.(v)   Various other bodies organising celebrations areconsidering whether to cancel for same reason.(vi)    Daily Mirror Correspondent has been here and writtenup sullen attitude of Maltese populace, etc.B^H (vii)    Prime Minister is in a dilemma over public holiday B^BJalready declared for 2nd June.    He has cancelledBVfl the celebrations, but to cancel the holiday itselfwould be unpopular. If he decides to cancel, hewill submit Government Notice for my approval*B^H I Normally I would act on his advice in such matters.    I should be grateful forB^BJ I guidance in case this arises.    I shall see   Archbishop tomorrow and report| Q   further if necessary.bbI -6-
1IV.  (ii)     TELEGRAM NO. 117 OF 16TH MAY TO THEMINISTER OF STATE FOR COLONIAL AFFAIRSROM MALTA (Sir G. Creasy)My telegram No. 116. Coronation.At my suggestion, Prime Minister saw me this morning.    I said that; he wished, I had transmitted his message immediately.    It seemed to me toave little room for compromise.    If he genuinely wished for a settlement orir any sort of favourable outcome of Miss Strickland&apos;s visit, he should, I ^^flxggested, consider carefully whether there was some way in which he could ^^Wispear less uncompromising.    I had noted that his message contained no mention&quot; local celebrations and that he had always taken the line that his quarrel was inj way against Her Majesty.    Could he make some gesture in this field which ^^flould demonstrate his sincerity?   He was very friendly and repeated hisssurances as to his attitude to The Queen, but held out no hope, adding thatsmplete acceptance of his wishes as regards flag would now make no difference.e emphasised that whole of Malta is behind him in his attitude.    ( This is&apos;margely correct.)   He will shortly be putting forward proposals for transfer of-vS/Ialta affairs to Commonwealth Relations Office while maintaining presentfonstitution.I 2.       There are no local developments or incidents worth reporting.    Unless ^-Wu.&apos;you still see some prospect of a solution, first consideration here (apart from^Biat referred to in your telegram No. 108 being dealt with separately) is to putJput a statement of Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s side of the case.    This should*Jt suggest, concentrate on the material in Minister of State&apos;s personal message,m^M as it is no use expecting the wider Commonwealth implications of Prime;JMinister&apos;s aspirations to be understood here.    I should be very grateful for your ^mWi^mm\       Jrarly views on this as, if a statement is to be issued, it should be within next ^-MIew days.
