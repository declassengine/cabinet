(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT))confidential.(53) 186 COPY NO._[ JU2ND JULY, 1953CABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE community memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State forForeign affairs at their meeting on 19th May the Cabinet authorised the circulationin the Interim Commission of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) ofa draft Agreement setting out the arrangements proposed for co-operationbetween the United Kingdom and the E.D.C. (C. C. (53) 37th Conclusions,Minute 3).    When circulating this draft, Sir F, Hoyer-Millar, the UnitedKingdom Deputy, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, informed the interim commission that we thought a unilateral declaration might be more appropriate than a formal agreement; but that, once agreement had beenreached on the substance, we would be ready to reconsider the matter of form in the light of the views expressed by the E.D. C. countries.2. The E.D. C, Governments have now all welcomed and accepted thesubstance of our proposals, namely:-(a) that there should be close co-operation between our forces and those of the E.D. C. ;(b) that we should associate ourselves with theDeclaration of the E.D. C. Governments thatthe term   of the North Atlantic Treaty shouldbe extended to fifty years;(c) that a United Kingdom Minister (or his deputy)should take part in the deliberations of theE.D. C. Council of Ministers for discussionof questions of mutual concern, such as thelevel of United Kingdom and E.D. C. forces under SACEUR&apos;s command;(d) that a United Kingdom representative should beappointed to the Board of Commissioners ofthe E.D.C. in order tc maintain day-to-daycontact.They all thought it important, however, that these proposals should be incorporated in a formal agreement which, they felt, would have a betterpsychological effect in their countries than a unilateral Declaration by theUnited Kingdom.
3. I recommend that we should accede to this request.   Ratificationprospects are still doubtful and the conclusion of a formal United Kingdom/E.D.C. Agreement in due course on the lines proposed may yet help totip the balance, particularly in France.   I therefore propose to informthe French Minister in Washington that we will enter into a formal agreement and suggest that a text should now be settled by the E.D.C.Interim Commission.4. I do not consider that a public announcement should be made about the contents of the Agreement for the time being.   The timing will depend on events in France;  and we should aim at making an announcementwhen it would be most helpful to ratification prospects there.Foreign Office, S.W.1.2nd July, 1953.
