EGYPT:  DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe United States Government wish to discuss during my visit to washington the future of our negotiations with Egypt about the base in the canal Zone.    When he was in Cairo, Mr. Dulles made it clear to the egyptians that he would try to produce some fresh ideas which might help to resolve the deadlock which we and the Egyptians reached two months ago, v/hen the latter suspended negotiations.    We have some indicationsfrom Egypt now that the Egyptians might be in a mood to resume these negotiations, and it is therefore desirable that we and the americans should reach identity of views on the line to be followed in any such negotiations.2.        There appears at present to be a considerable difference of view between the United States Government and ourselves.    The Americansseem to have been impressed by the strength of Egyptian resistance to our proposals (see Annex), and it is likely that they will urge us to acceptsomething on the following lines:-(i)   We should transfer the base to Egyptian control.(ii)    British experts should be limited to the absoluteminimum  and arrangements made for trainingEgyptian personnel to replace them within aminimum period.    Thereafter British inspectorsmight inspect Egyptian maintenance of our supplies and of the base installations.(iii) Instructions should be sent to the British Military attache in Cairo and these instructions should be forwarded to theEgyptian Base Commander through such channels as theEgyptian Government might prescribe.(iv) Egypt should at the same time give a private undertaking that the base would be made available in case of general war to the Arab states and their allies (&quot;allies&quot; would coverus in view of our treaties with Jordan and Iraq).(v) In addition, on the conclusion of an agreement onevacuation and the maintenance of the base, Neguib mightpublicly invite the United Kingdom and the United states to help develop the defence of Egypt, including training and equipping all Egyptian forces.

initiative, the United Kingdom and the Uni&apos;;ed states could jointly negotiate the necessary formal defence requirements of the West, as well as assistance to Egypt.The results of these negotiations could be made public.3. I do not think that an agreement on these lines would be either politically or militarily acceptable:  nor does General Sir BrianRobertson.   We have hitherto insisted upon Case A; the american proposal would mean that we should have no technicians in the base withina comparatively short period and should thus be reduced to Case C.Nevertheless, if we are to secure Egyptian acceptance of Case A, it isessential that we should have American support, or at the very leastthat the Americans should not give the Egyptians any indication that they believe something less than Case A to be reasonable.   So long as the egyptians think they can play the Americans off against us, the chances of our reaching agreement are negligible;  and the consequences of a failure to reach agreement might be, as the Foreign Secretary haspointed out, very serious.   This is a point which will have to be madeabundantly clear to Mr. Dulles.4. I have therefore considered the following alternatives:-Alternative I(i) We stand firm on the essentials of Case A (retention of Britishtechnicians, receiving their instructions from London, for the duration of the agreement;  a copy of the instructions couldhowever be given to the Egyptian Base Commander, and semelatitude might be allowed regarding the numbers of techniciansand the nature of any joint air defence organisation).(ii) A.ny agreement with Egypt to remain in force until the countriesmembers of the Arab Security Pact are organised (with theassistance and participation of other friendly powers) in a manner to ensure their effective defence against external aggression.   It shall in any case remain in force for an initial x^period of five years, after which date either partyshall be entitled to request discussion of its revision on thegrounds that the condition of principle referred to above hasbeen fulfilled.(iii) In the event of an aggression or threat of aggression against egypt by an outside power, the base area shall be at the fulldisposal of the United Kingdom for the support and maintenanceof the forces which she furnishes to aid Egypt in repellingaggression.   An aggression, or threat of aggression, by an outside power against Turkey,   Persia or any Arab state shallbe regarded as a threat of aggression against Egypt for thispurpose.lternative II(i) We stand fast on the essentials of Case A (as above).(ii) The duration of the agreement shall be for ten years.(iii) After the conclusion of the agreement, we would seek tonegotiate with Egypt a regional defence organisation for theMiddle East, which should include the United States, and pending
&apos;2Lthe conclusion of such an agreement, we and the UnitedStates would refrain from furnishing arms or economic assistance to Egypt, beyond what she is already receiving.Re commendations5. Of these alternatives, I prefer I, and I would like the authorityof my colleagues to put this to the Americans.   If they will not support us in seeking such an agreement, then I v/ould propose to suggestAlternative II to them.   If they will not accept either, then I should be obliged to make it clear to them that I had no authority to go any further and that we should retain full liberty to conduct our negotiations with the egyptians as seems good to us, and that we should be prepared to acceptthe consequences of a failure to reach agreement with them.6. I hope very much that it will not come to this.   I would stressagain the great importance of securing American support, not only inorder that our negotiations with 3Sgypt may have a better chance of success,but also because, if we do reach an agreement with Egypt, it will in my view be essential that the Americans underv/rite such an agreement, ifthere is to be any prospect of the Egyptians keeping it.   In my talks with the Americans, I propose to make the most of the fact that thereare signs, as I mentioned above, that the Egyptians are beginning to comesome way to meet us and therefore the chances of an agreement, if we take them now, are by no means negligible.7. I am taking with me to Washington General Robertson, whowill be able to explain our ideas to the Americans in detail, and inparticular to stress how reasonable is our interpretation of Case A.QForeign Office, S.W.1.3rd July, 1953.ANNEXFor ease of reference I would recall that the proposals which our negotiators in Cairo were authorised to put to the Egyptians were in outlineas follows:-(a) a phased withdrawal of British Armed Forces from egytian territory;(b) the maintenance of the Canal Zone base in peace with a view toits earliest possible use in the event of war;(c) an arrangement for air defence of Egypt;(d) Egyptian participation in an organisation for Middle East defence
a programme of military ancl economic assistance by theUnited Kingdom and the United States to Egypt.Under (b) above we have insisted upon Case A as follows:-The Canal Zone would be handed over to Egypt and the base area would be placed under Egyptian    control.(Note:    This means in practice that all land, buildings,communications and facilities would be transferred to egyptian ownership but British equipment in the base would remain British property;  the base would be maintained by theEgyptian Government in working order at all times;  military command of the base area would be vested in an Egyptian officer;British technicians would have the technical management andcontrol of certain specified installations in order to maintain,use, handle and dispose of British-owned equipment. )The depots and installations waald serve as a working maintenancebase for a proportion of the Middle East Land Forces in peace.The R.A.F. would not, however, carry out any maintenance frominstallations in Egypt in peace.The Royal Navy would retain equipment in Egypt for thedefence of ports and maintain it under British supervision and have the use of the existing commercial oil storage facilities and pipe-lines.The Army would retain not more than 5,000 personnel to runthese installations and the R.A.F. not more than 2,000 for the same purpose.(Note:  Some flexibility in regard to these numbers would be acceptable. )There would be an integrated Anglo &quot;Egyptian Air defence organisation, including Headquarters, two British Day fighter squadrons and one British Night Fighter Squadron, Control and report-Dorting Organisations, etc.(Note:    Since we are now unlikely to have these squadronsavailable, joint training arrangements and the right to use an airfield or airfields would probably suffice.)An Allied-manned staging post would be maintained in Egypt.
