Printed for the Cabinet.  My 1953The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of................................................_____TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 1927th My, 1953CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations note by the Prime minister circulate for the information of my colleagues a note by General Robertsonon the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,6th My, 1953.Prime MinisterANGLO-EGYPTIAN negotiations note by General Robertson on Cases A, B and C, and Certain Other PointsThe Difference Between the Three cases it is common to all three Cases that we transfer control of the Base Area to the egyptians together with ownership of all buildings and lands and we accept theappointment of an Egyptian Base Area Commander who would have wide powersaffecting the functioning of the Base.44455
2,  Shorn of non-essentials the salient features of the three cases are:  : Case A.-We retain control of the management of the principal installa-tions in the Base. This, means that what happens in those depots, work-shops, &amp;c, is governed by directions issued by the British Service departments and is carried out under the orders and supervision of British officers on the spot assisted by a small British staff. The Base functions in peace time forthe maintenance of some of our Forces in the Middle East. It is nominallyavailable for immediate use on the outbreak of war.Case B-We hand over control completely to the Egyptians, includingcontrol of our depots and workshops. A small British technical staff is left toassist the Egyptians, but this staff also will be under Egyptian executive control.We shall not be able to make any considerable use of the Base in peace, though. we might hope to turn over the stocks to ensure that they are kept fresh. It is ,stated in the paper agreed with the Americans that under Case B it should bepossible to re-activate the Base within sixty days of the outbreak of war. Thisis almost certainly too optimistic.Case C. This differs from Case B. in that no British personnel are left behind other than a few Inspectors. It would not be possible to use the base in peace, nor even to turn over the stocks. It is estimated, again optimistically,that such a Base might be re-activated within ninety days. It is furtherrecognised that under Case C the American strategic bomber bases in egypt would probably not be available to them immediately, due to lack of efficientmaintenance of the equipment there.Numbers of British Personnel in the Base3. The difference between Cases A and B does not reside in the number ofBritish personnel remaining in the Base but in the functions which they perform.Under Case A they are executive, under Case B they assist the Egyptians. Inneither case is a minimum number fixed. Authority has been given to the delegation to go as low as 3,000 if essential in order to secure Case A; underCase B a &quot; rather smaller number &quot; would be retained. In neither case will numbersbe sufficient to provide any degree of force.The Importance of Case A4. In a note submitted to you on 6th June I gave reasons as to why we should adhere to the essential principle of Case A and refuse to accept Case B. the primary reason is that it is not practicable to have British equipment looked afterby men who are not British, do not understand British technique and are not responsible to British Authority. In the paper agreed with the Americans inLondon in December it was stated that Cases B and C though &quot;worse bothmilitarily and financially .... might have to be accepted.&quot; My contention isthat they are impracticable, and that we should take our equipment away altogetherrather than accept either of them.  Note also that under Case B British personnel
remain only &quot; to assist the Egyptians in their task.&quot; This implies that the Egyptianscan ask us to take them away as soon as they no longer need their assistance.Case B will quickly degenerate into Case C; ws shall then find ourselves with no british personnel in the Base. Apart from the bad effect on the maintenance ofour stocks, this will mean also that we shall no longer have a &quot; foot in the door.&quot;5. If you feel that you must meet the President by making some adjustments to our position, I recommend that instead of giving up the fundamental principleof control of our installations you should consider the following:  (a) The original &quot; package &quot; deal included a scheme of integrated air defence and Egyptian participation in a Middle East Defence Organisation(M.E.D.O.). Both these points have since been virtually dropped. Wecannot.find the resources ourselves necessary for a scheme of integratedair defence. We agree with the Americans that there is no hope of getting Egypt into .a ME.D.O. at this stage. The dropping of thesetwo features from the &quot; package &quot; might be a good talking point foryou with the President.(b) You might show a readiness to give your Delegation some elasticity onthe question of numbers because, as is pointed out above, it is not thenumber of British personnel that matters but the functions which theyperform.(c) If you feel able to accept the idea which I put forward below about the duration of the agreement, you can point out that you are at this timeonly seeking a short-term agreement to hold the position until aM.E.D.O. has been established. This should appeal to the Americansbecause Dulles himself talked about treating this agreement as a first stage towards a M.E.D.O. We shall be more likely to get Americanbacking to our demands if we show that they are only meant to cover a short term and not to represent a permanent arrangement.(d) While I appreciate your dislike of anything that aims at saving Egyptianface, I am bound to advise that something in this direction is possible without the loss of anything of substance and that the Egyptians are more ready to compromise on substance than on appearance.Duration of the Agreement6. The difficulty about this is that we must, if we stick to the essentialprinciple of Case A, retain our British staff in the depots throughout the periodof the duration of the agreement. If it were not for this the Egyptians might accept a ten years&apos; agreement, but in my opinion neither this, nor any otherEgyptian Government, will agree now that a considerable body of British soldiersshould remain in Egypt for a period as long as ten years.7. I suggest that the duration of the agreement should be linked with theorganisation of a proper system of defence for the Middle East, i.e., a M.E.D.O.or some variation thereof.
8. However, the need to fix a minimum period will remain and I do notmyself consider that agreement will be possible on a longer minimum period than five years.Right of Re-Entry9. The President proposed that this point should be covered by a &quot;privateundertaking&quot; given by the Egyptian Government. That is not good enough.My idea is that there must be a clause about it in the agreement, and I have sub-mitted the following draft which has been approved in principle by the Chiefs ofStaff and Foreign Office.&quot;If such action should be required of Egypt by her obligation underthe Charter of the United Nations, or in the event of an aggression or threat of aggression against Egypt by an outside Power, the base area shall be at thefull disposal of Great Britain for the support and maintenance of the forces which she furnishes to aid Egypt in repelling the aggression. An aggression,or threat of aggression, by an outside Power against Turkey, Persia or anyArab State shall be regarded as a threat- of aggression against Egypt for thepurpose of this Article.&quot;(Signed)        BRIAN H. ROBERTSON.22nd June, 1953.
