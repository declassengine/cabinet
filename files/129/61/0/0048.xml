Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (53) 19817th July, 1953CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF GATWICK airport memorandum by the Lord chancellor at the Cabinefs meeting on 11th November, 1952 (C.C (52) 95th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Minister of Civil Aviation suggested that, in view of the oppositionto the proposed development of Gatwick Airport which was showing itself,especially amongst Government supporters, the Cabinet might wish to review their decision of 29th July on that development (C.C. (52) 74th Conclusions, Minute 9)and that for this purpose he should circulate a memorandum in the form of a draft white Paper explaining the Governments attitude on all aspects of the matter. TheCabinet invited the Minister to proceed accordingly. &apos;2. Subsequently, the Prime Minister approved a suggestion that a small committee of Ministers under my chairmanship and including the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Labour should, in consultation with the Minister of housing, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Civil Aviation, examinethe draft White Paper before it was submitted to the Cabinet. I now report to theCabinet on this Committee&apos;s behalf.3. The Committee found it necessary, before addressing themselves to the merits of the case for developing Gatwick Airport, to reconsider:  (a) the need of a &quot;main alternate&quot; airport to London Airport;     ::;(b) the alternatives to. Gatwick as the &quot; main alternate.&quot;The present report accordingly deals first with these aspects of the problem.The Need of a &quot; main alternate &quot; to London Airport4. The need arises from the rapid increase in the volume of air traffic in theLondon area which has already occurred (from 109,000 landings or take-offs of civil aircraft alone in 1947 to some 161,000 in 1952) and the expected further increases.It is true that, if civil flying from Northolt is brought to an end in 1955, as is pro-posed, London Airport might be able to handle for a further period in good weatherthe bulk of the traffic offering. The case for a &quot; main alternate &quot; rests rather on theneed for adequate facilities for handling an expanding volume of traffic whenweather conditions at London Airport are adverse. Although improvements innavigational aids are expected to increase the number of movements which can be handled in an hour in bad weather, the prospects in this direction are not sufficientlypromising to make a &quot; main alternate &quot; airport unnecessary. If at any time in thefuture airline operators were to cease to feel satisfied that our facilities were adequate for handling with complete safety all traffic offering, whatever the weather conditions, there would be an inevitable tendency to divert scheduled air services from London. Such an eventuality ought clearly to be avoided if at all possible,and the Committee, therefore, felt satisfied that the case for developing a &quot;mainalternate &quot; had been fully established.44502b
5. The &quot; main alternate &quot; to London Airport should fulfil as many as possible of the following criteria:-(i) It should be on one of the main air traffic approaches to London;-&apos;&apos;   ; (ii) It should involve no conflict with the traffic patterns of London Airport;(iii) It should be situated to the west of a line drawn north and south throughthe centre of London in order that interference with essential R.A.F. andother military flying may be kept to a minimum;(iv) It should enjoy substantially different weather conditions from london airport;(v) It should offer easy access to and from London;(vi) Its development and operation should involve the minimum disturbanceto non-flying interests;(vii) Its development should involve as little expenditure as possible.6. The Committee were assured that only Stansted and Blackbushe metenough of those criteria to make them serious alternatives to Gatwick. Of these,Stansted, which lies some 30 miles to the North-East of London, fulfils criteria(ii), (iv), (vi) and (vii). On the other hand, it lies somewhat off the main air trafficroutes; its use would interfere seriously both with training for the fighter defence ofLondon and with the use of certain bomber aerodromes; and some improvementin travel facilities to and from London would be essential before it could be broughtinto operation. Blackbushe fulfils criteria (i), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii). On theother hand, it is only some 15 miles to the West of London Airport so that, whenadverse weather conditions made diversion to the &quot; main alternate &quot; necessary,problems of air traffic control would arise to which there would be no satisfactory solution; although it fulfils criterion (iii), its development as the &quot; main alternate &quot;would in practice involve severe restrictions on R.A.F. flying from Odiham; andits communications with London are inadequate. It is, moreover, only four milesfrom Farnborough where experimental flying is expected to continue on the present scale in spite of the prospective removal of part of.the Royal Aircraft Establishmentto Bedford. For this reason the Minister of Supply is strongly opposed to the selection of Blackbushe as the &quot; main alternate,&quot; and the Committee were impressed by the strength of his case. It is true that the airfield is to be developed for the United States Air Force, but their use of it in peacetime is likely to remainextremely limited and will, therefore, not interfere with flying from Farnborough.7. The Committee concluded that both Stansted and Blackbushe must, there-fore, be ruled out.Suitability of Gatwick to be the &quot; main alternate &quot;8. Gatwick fulfils prima facie all the criteria enumerated in paragraph 5except (vi) and (vii), but in view of the criticism which the selection of Gatwickhas aroused and of the doubts which have been expressed about its suitability, bothin the Press and elsewhere, ,the Committee considered it desirable to satisfy them-selves fully under each of the separate heads.(i) It should be on one of the main air traffic approaches to LondonThis criterion is clearly fulfilled in the case of Gatwick, but it should be addedthat Gatwick offers certain positive advantages in this respect. While it is of the essence of a bad weather &quot; main alternate &quot; that it should not normally be usedto full capacity, considerations of economy make it desirable that it should never-theless be used to the maximum practicable extent. Gatwick happens to be verysuitable as a regular terminal for services to the Channel Islands and the nearerdestinations on the Continent.(ii) It should involve no conflict with the traffic patterns of LondonA irportThis criterion is also clearly fulfilled and no comment is called for.(iii) It should be situated to the west of a line drawn North and Souththrough the centre of London in order that interference withessential R.A.F. and other military flying may.&apos;be kept to aminimumAlthough Gatwick is situated just to the West of the line in question, it hasbeen necessary for the Minister of Civil Aviation and the Secretary of State for
Air to agree upon a system of air traffic control which will enable Gatwick to beused by civil aircraft on the scale contemplated without undue interference withflying at the important R.A.F. airfields at Biggin Hill and West Mailing. the pattern of control agreed upon between the two Departments, which the Secretaryof State for Air regards as essential to the continued use of the two R.A.F. airfields in question, may result in the number of movements at Gatwick having to remainlimited to 170 a day. Experience may show, however, that it is possible to increase this number without departing from the agreed pattern of control. The Ministerof Civil Aviation does not consider that this limitation on the scale of movementsat Gatwick makes it unsuitable to be London Airporfs &quot; main alternate &quot; and theCommittee saw no reason to disagree with him.(iv) It should enjoy substantially different weather conditions from london AirportIn view of doubts which have been expressed, particularly in the Press, aboutthe suitability of Gatwick from the weather point of view, the Committee obtainedfrom the Minister of Civil Aviation the best meteorological information availablein respect of London Airport, Gatwick and Blackbushe. This showed that ondays when visibility at London Airport was below the normal &quot; diversion level&quot;(visibility of less than 550 yards and/or 5/8 cloud or more at 300 feet), visibilityat Gatwick was on an average above that level on 55 per cent, of the occasionscovered. The figures showed, moreover, that in the matter of weather there was little to choose between Gatwick and Blackbushe (or, indeed, Stansted).(v) It should offer easy access to and from LondonDoubts were expressed in the Committee about the practicability of fittingrail traffic to and from Gatwick Airport, if it were developed in the manner pro-posed, into the already heavy traffic on the line from Victoria to Haywards Heath.The Minister of Civil Aviation obtained for the Committee&apos;s information a reportfrom the Railway Executive, approved by the British Transport Commission,showing that an adequate rail service could be provided at a cost of about 1 million, to be divided between what is attributable to the developed airportand v/hat is attributable to Crawley New Town. The Minister of Civil Aviationinformed the Committee that if the eventual division of the cost was on a 50:50basis, it would be possible to find  500,000 from within the estimated total expendi-ture of  6 millions on the development of Gatwick. The Minister of Housingstated that he was not satisfied that the existing services were not adequate to theneeds of Crawley New Town and that he, therefore, must not be taken as acceptingliability for the cost of any part of the projected railway works.Objections to Gatwick9. The main objections to the proposed development of Gatwick continueto lie in the disturbance it will cause to non-flying interests, particularly CrawleyNew Town, and its cost. Some disturbance to local interests would be unavoidable,wherever the &quot; main alternate &quot; were situated, but feeling at Gatwick is exacerbatedby the assurances given on behalf of the late Government to the Crawley NewTown Development Corporation and to the local authorities concerned that therewas no intention to develop Gatwick airport.10. Since the matter was last considered by the Cabinet a revision of thedevelopment plan has been found to be necessary in the interests of safety. Thisrevision involves not only the taking of an additional hundred acres of agricultural land in the first stage and the demolition of an additional 20 houses, but therestriction of the runways to 6,000 and 7,000 ft. as compared with 9,000 at london airport. The Committee were concerned lest this restriction would seriously reducethe effectiveness of Gatwick as a &quot; main alternate,&quot; but they obtained assurances that in practice the use which aircraft operators would be able to make of theproposed runways at Gatwick would be broadly equivalent to the use which theyat present make of the runways at London Airport.11. The estimated cost of the first stage of Gatwick&apos;s development remains at some  6 millions, spread over the next seven years. Against this sum, however,there can be set the countervailing advantages enumerated in paragraph 12 of thedraft White Paper....  44502        &apos; : \,&apos;       , b 2
Presentation of the Government&apos;s decision       -   . ,12. After giving full weight to all relevant factors the Committee concluded,that there was no practicable alternative to the development of Gatwick as the:&quot; main alternate &quot; to London Airport and that they ought, therefore, to invite, the;Cabinet to.confirm their earlier decision. The Committee recognised, however/that it will not be easy to satisfy public opinion as to the justification for thisdecision and that it is of the first importance that the decision should be convincinglypresented to the public, who must be left in no doubt of the overriding arguments!for-proceeding with a project which may appear prima facie to be open to such:serious objections. The Committee, therefore, devoted careful attention to the:terms of the draft White Paper submitted by the Minister of Civil Aviation and attheir last meeting approved the draft attached to this report.Conclusions13.   On behalf of the Committee I invite the Cabinet:  (1) to confirm their earlier decision that Gatwick Airport should be developed&apos;as the &quot; main alternate &quot; to London&apos;Airport.(2) To approve the draft White Paper attached to this report.(3) To authorise the Minister of Civil Aviation to publish the White paper in the week beginning 20th July.SIMONDS;Lord Chancellors Office, S.W. 1,16th July, 1953.

L0NDON&apos;S AIRPORTS1. For those who travel or send goods by air, London is the mostimportant centre in the United Kingdom and one of the most important in Europe. In the small airspace round the capital more aeroplanes fly aseach year passes. In 1947 there were 109,000 landings or take-offs of civil aircraft at London&apos;s airports ; in 1952 nearly 161,000. Last year over one and three quarter million passengers went through these airports almost600,000 more than through our busiest seaport for passengers Dover.Cheaper fares are now bringing air travel within the reach of a much largerpublic and traffic will build up even faster. As a result, within the next ten years the number of scheduled flights in the London area may welldouble itself.2. The increase of air traffic presents great problems which must be solvedif Britain is to maintain the outstanding place in civil aviation which she has already won in the face of keen international competition. In theyears to come the air will be hardly less essential to our well-being thanthe sea. To no small extent the future of this country in World trade andas a great Power will depend on our holding and indeed advancing our placein this form of transport. The most important problem is that Of thecontrol of aircraft in the air near London. The control organisation isalready heavily burdened and unless radical changes are made it will, ina few years&apos; time, be unable to provide a safe and efficient service for theincreased traffic. It is essential to simplify the pattern of air traffic and this can only be done by re-organising the system of airports near London. Atpresent the Ministry of Civil Aviation operates seven airports in the london area : London Airport, Northolt, Blackbushe, Bovingdon, Croydon, Gatwickand Stansted. Her Majesty&apos;;s Government propose to reduce this number to three operational airports (London Airport, Gatwick and Blackbushe) andone (Stansted) to be held in reserve. The reasons for this choice and theuses to whioh the three airports will be put are explained in this paper.3. Ninety per cent, of air transport flights in the London area at presentuse London Airport and Northolt. These airports are only five miles apart.It is becoming increasingly difficult, and may in time even become dangerous,to use them both at once. Soon it will be necessary for civil flying atNortholt to cease and when this stage is reached Northolt will be returnedto the Royal Air Force, whose use of it will be limited and controlledso as not to interfere with London Airport. The bulk of air services will then be concentrated on London Airport, which is being developed forthis purpose.4. In good weather London Airport should be able to deal for many years to come with all the traffic expected (apart from some charter flights) exceptin the summer when travel is at its height. During this period an additionalairport will be needed to take some of the seasonal services now operatedfrom Northolt to places such as the Channel Islands and to near Continentalresorts. Furthermore in the bad visibility so often met with near Londonthere will be times when some or all aircraft will have to be diverted aiwayfrom London Airport. To receive these aircraft two other airports are needed, one of which would serve as the main alternate and base for the seasonal services just mentioned. The other, whilst retaining a few locallybased operators would be used as a supplementary aerodrome to handleaircraft which for any reason could not use the main alternate.   Unless
the problems of diversions and of seasonal traffic can be solved, internationaltraffic may turn away from these Islands and this must at all costs be prevented.5. In reaching the decision that London needs three airports for these purposes, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered whether future technicaldevelopments would lessen the demands for aerodromes with large runways.Navigational aids and operational techniques will continue to improve as theyears go by, but with the growth of air traffic these devices cannot of themselves solve the problems. The helicopter too may well have a greatfuture, hut it is unlikely to bring about any substantial reduction in thenumber of flights made by fixed-wing aircraft. It is a relatively slowmachine and it is most improbable that it will replace fixed-wing aircraft onflights of over 300 miles in length for at least many years to come. Inany event, it will not be until the next decade that truly commercial helicopterscan be expected ; and by that time the intensity of fixed-wing aircraft flightswill have further increased. Nor would it be practicable to disperse airportsaway from London, using helicopters to ferry large numbers of passengersto the capital. Apart from the cost, operations on the scale necessary would create very serious congestion in the air. The helicopter, therefore, willnot affect the particular problem of aerodromes in the London area..6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have also considered whether in the present economic situation they should not defer taking a decision on this matter,which demands substantial expenditure, until conditions have improved.They have concluded for the following reasons that a decision cannot be delayed. None of the existing aerodromes could provide for diversions onthe scale necessary and at the same time provide a base for short distanceservices, without a great deal of constructional work. This work takestime, and if the airports are not chosen now and the work started the reliefwill come too late. Air traffic will be slowed down ; airline operators will cease to be satisfied that we oan handle all their services with speed and safety; and London may lose its position as a great centre of world air transport and, having lost it, may be unable to build it up again.7. In selecting alternate airports several requirements must be satisfied.Ideally, they should have good visibility when the main . airport has bad,should have convenient and rapid access to London, should lie on the mainair routes serving the capital, should pose no intractable traffic problems andshould create as little disturbance as possible to property, amenities and agricultural land. Most of the air services converge on London from theSouth and South East so that the main alternate should be South of thecapital. The second alternate, which will be used less, should be to theWest.8. Of the five minor airports near London (GBlackbushe, Bovingdon,Stansted, Croydon and Gatwick) none can toe used intensively, the first three because of air traffic control problems and the last two because theyare too small. These airports have been considered, together with all airfields and likely sites within a radius Of about 50 miles of Central London, aspossible places for development as the main alternate. The Appendix givesdetails of the principal sites considered. From this it will be seen that ofall the sites Gatwick alone meets substantially all the requirements and her majesty&apos;s Government accordingly propose that it shall be developed as themain alternate airport, and that Blackbushe shall be used as the supple-mentary since it is the most suitable aerodrome for that purpose. A thirdairport must be held in reserve in case traffic increases even more than is
IS2expected, and Stansted will be so held, but it will, together with Bovingdonand Croydon, cease to be used as a civil airport once Gatwick is sufficientlydeveloped.9. The principal objections to developing Gatwick as the main alternateairport are thai it will disturb amenities, that it is too close to the CrawleyNew Town and to the Railway, and that the expense is not justified ; andcriticisms have in particular been made of the proposal to divert the BrightonRoad. This road must inevitably be cut by an enlarged Gatwick, but theplan for the ainport&apos;s development has been revised since last autumn sothat the runways will be half a mile further from the railway than was originally proposed. This will make it possible to divert the Brighton Roadfor the time being between the airport and the railway. This diversion willbe combined with the roads providing access to the airport terminal andto the railway station, which will serve the airport and its neighbourhood.The extra cost of this arrangement over the bare cost of the necessary accessroads to the airport and station will be small, and its adoption temporarilywill not prejudice any long term plans for the Brighton radial road whenthe time comes to construct it. Doubts have also been expressed aboutGatwiek&apos;s weather. The important point is not that it should be good(though this would be desirable) but that it should be different from con-ditions at London Airport. This it can be shown to be. As a general butnot invariable rule, the weather condition which most severely affects thevisibility at London is a light easterly wind which subjects London Airportto smoke pollution from the Metropolis. Now and again in the winterradiation fog, particularly early in the day, affects all the country aroundLondon or even further afield. No airport near London can cater for this and in these conditions aircraft have to be diverted elsewhere. But taken as a whole, when Londohs visibility has been poor, Ga.twick&apos;s has been better on over half of the occasions. Indeed during the fogs of last winter(from December, 1952, to March, 1953), precise records show that 66 percent, of all aircraft diverted from London and Northolt could have landed atGatwick had a runway been available.10. As for the airport&apos;s general effect on local amenities, it cannotbe denied that aircraft are noisy and that in this densely populated islandthe construction of aerodromes inevitably means some disturbance. Thisis so at Gatwick, but its runways and the courses to be followed by aircrafttaking off and landing there have been planned so as to reduce to aminimum the noise and disturbance and the risk of accidents. Gatwickwill not be used intensively all the year round. Its principal purpose willbe to receive aircraft diverted from London Airport when visibility is poorthere and this purpose could not be achieved if too many regular services were based at Gatwick. As has been stated above it is intended that london airport shall take over most of Northolfs traffic, and that Gatwick&apos;s use as a base shall be restricted to some short distance services and to charteroperations. Almost all the short distance services will operate only in the summer months and the hours of daylight.11. The capital cost of the first stage of the development of Gatwick isestimated at about six million pounds, spread over the next seven years.This is a large sum of money, but the finances of the aerodromes in theLondon Area must be looked at as a whole and this expenditure should beconsidered against the general background. In the first place, a mainalternate is essential if London Airport is to realise its full earning capacity.Secondly, once London&apos;s air services can be concentrated into three active
(Stycivil airports London, Gatwick and Blackibushe substantial economies will result. Civil flying will stop at Northolt, Bovingdon, and Stansted ; Croydonwill be sold and will become available for other purposes.12. Against this six million pounds, therefore, can be set a gain by theExchequer of a substantial capital sum from the sale of Croydon, and a net annual saving of about  450,000 on operating costs at the airports whichwill be closed to civil flying, allowing for the increased running expenditure which a larger Gatwick will need. Moreover, of the six million pounds,about half-a-million will be spent in providing accommodation for airlineoperators who transfer to Gatwick, and this will repay itself over the years in rents. The flying costs of the airline operators themselves will be con-siderably reduced. Most important, unless we can develop a suitablealternate, the natural expansion of air traffic and therefore of revenue willbe seriously checked. This, in turn, will postpone the day when the operationof London&apos;s airports will cease to be a burden on the taxpayer.13. For these reasons Her Maiesty&apos;s Government have decided to developGatwick as London&apos;s main alternate and overflow airport. British civilaviation must be maintained on sound foundations, one of the most important of which is an adequate and economic system of aerodromes. The develop-ment of Gatwick is essential for this purpose and will be a sound investment for the future prosperity of the country.APPENDIXDETAILS OF PRINCIPAL SITES CONSIDERED IN THE FINAL selection of THE MAIN ALTERNATE TO LONDON AIRPORTThe Requirements for the Main AlternateThe requirements of the main alternate to London Airport are set out inparagraph 7 of the White Paper.   Ideally it should: (a) have good visibility when the main airport has bad;(b) have convenient and rapid access to London:(c) lie on the main air routes serving the capital;(d) be so situated that aircraft using it can be kept well clear of those using the main airport and pose no other intractable problems of air traffic control,either to military or to civil flying, and(e) create as little disturbance as possible to property, amenities and agricultural land.As most of the air services converge on London from rhe South and South East,the requirement at (c) could only be met by the main alternate being to the Southof the capital. The second alternate, which would be used less, could be to the Westor North. A diagram showing the distribution of air transport movements in theLondon area is appended.The Choice of the SiteA large number of aerodromes and sites within a radius of about 50 miles of central London were considered before Gatwick was selected. The choice wasnarrowed down to four aerodromes, Gatwick, Blackbushe, Stanstcd and Dunsfoldand of these Gatwick alone substantially met all requirements for a main alternate.
Main AlternateGatwick (Surrey)Gatvvick is 25 miles South of London. It is near the busiest air routes to Londonbut sufficiently far from London Airport to reduce interference to a minimum betweenaircraft using the two airports. There are some nearby military airfields butprocedures have been worked out which v/ill enable satisfactory use to be madeof both Gatwick and the military airfields concerned. It is near a main railway line and approximately 40 minutes travelling time from Victoria Station. Its weather,while intrinsically no better than the weather at the other choices, is sufficientlydifferent from that of London Airport, when visibility there is poor, to make itsuitable for diversions save in exceptional conditions. At present it is a grassaerodrome and too small for large transport aircraft but it can be developed to meetthe requirements of a main alternate. Any disturbance to property, amenities and agricultural land is regrettable, but at Gatwick this will be relatively small. about half the land taken over could remain in agricultural use for grass drying.Blackbushe (Hampshire)The full use of this aerodrome would be severely limited by two intractable air traffic control problems. First, it is only some four miles from the very important and long established aerodrome and installations of the Royal Aircraft establishment at Farnborough. The traffic patterns of the two aerodromes inevitably conflict andif Blackbushe carried the traffic proposed for Gatwick the conflict would be accentuatedto the point that the vital experimental flying at Farnborough would be incompatible with the safety of civil air passengers. Moreover, it is out of the question to limit the experimental programme at Farnborough. It is equally unacceptable to hamperFarnborough&apos;s operations to the extent which would be inevitable if civil controlledairspace was established round Blackbushe. There would also be some conflict withthe traffic patterns of an important Royal Air Force aerodrome. Even if at some future date Blackbushe were to be enlarged for military reasons, these conflicts wouldbe in no way diminished and Blackbushe would still be unable to accept sufficienttraffic for it to be used as London&apos;s main alternate. While, however, Blackbushe isnot suitable for use as the main alternate it is a good aerodrome. Although, as mentioned above, it is not practicable to include it in controlled airspace, it is suitableas the supplementary aerodrome for use by the relatively small amount of traffic form the North and West.   It has been chosen to serve this purpose.Duns/old (Surrey)Although this aerodrome could be developed at slightly less expense than Gatwickits access to London is markedly inferior and could only be improved by a quitedisproportionate expenditure. It is, moreover, used by an important manufacturer ofmilitary aircraft with whose activities international civil operations would be incompatible and for whom another base would have to be found at considerablecost and delay to production.   It is also required for military purposes.Bovingdon (Hertfordshire)This aerodrome is about 18 miles to the North of London Airport. To reach it,aircraft on the busy Southern routes would have to be routed either through, or bya wide detour around, the air traffic pattern of London Airport itself. This wouldcomplicate rather than resolve air traffic control problems. Aircraft on Southernroutes would, moreover, have to fly about 40 miles further each way if they usedBovingdon instead of Gatwick. The aerodrome would need substantial development to make it suitable as an alternate.Stansted (Essex)Like Bovingdon, Stansted is on the wrong side of London for most of the aircraftroutes. Furthermore, although it is a good aerodrome and would need relatively little expenditure for use as an alternate it has two further substantial disadvantages.Its access by road or rail to London is inferior, travelling time being about If to2 hours. There is at present a very large amount of military flying from nearbyairfields which severely limits the use which can be made of it by civil aircraft.
ISCOther AerodromesDetails of the other principal sites considered as main or second alternates andthe reasons for their rejection are shown below:Biggin Hill and West Mailing (Kent)These are both important Royal Air Force jet lighter aerodromes which cannotbe given up. The possibility of joint-use with the Royal Air Force was examinedbut on grounds of safety was found to be impracticable.Croydon (Surrey)Croydon is a small grass aerodrome in a heavily built up area. It could onlybe extended and used at such great expense and disturbance to amenities as to make itsselection out of the question.Fairlop (Essex)As a main alternate, it is on the wrong side of London. Moreover, aircraft using itwould fly low over heavily built up areas, and full extension would necessitateconsiderable demolition of property. Its weather conditions are not so different from those at London Airport as to qualify it for the role of alternate.Fairoaks (Surrey)Like Blackbushe, Fairoaks is too near Farnborough and is even worse placedin relation to London Airport, being only nine miles away. Not only would there be serious conflict with London Airport air traffic but the two airports share much thesame weather.   Very considerable expenditure would be involved in its extension.Lashain (Hampshire)Lasham, although a good aerodrome, is some 45 miles from London with veryinferior communications, much too far from London to serve as an effective alternate.Luton (Bedfordshire)This aerodrome is situated 30 miles to the North of London. It suffers fromoperational disadvantages similar to those at Bovingdon and it would requireconsiderable and costly development.Penshurst (Kent)Penshurst is a small grass aerodrome 25 miles to the South of London. It cannotbe extended to meet international standards and is too close to the military fighteraerodromes at West Mailing and Biggin Hill to enable satisfactory air traffic controlarrangements to be made.printed and published by her majesty&apos;s stationery officeTo be purchased from york House, Kingsway, London, w.c.2      423 Oxford Street, London, w.1p.o.  box 569, london, s.e.113a Castle Street, Edinburgh, 2      1 St. Andrew&apos;s Crescent, Cardiff39 King Street, Manchester, 2     Tower Lane, Bristol, 12 Edmund Street, Birmingham, 3      80 Chichester Street, belfast or from any Bookseller1953Price   d net printed    IN &quot;GREAT    BRITAIN(19981)   Wt.       -V213   3, 100   7/53   d.l.
