Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 17618th June, 1953CABINETEAST/WEST trade memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, and theMinister of Transport and Civil aviation on 3rd March the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power on the control of shippingengaged in trade with China (C. (53) 80) and authorised the making of the Controlof Trade by Sea (China and North Korea) Order, 1953 (C.C. (53) 16th Conclusions,Minute 4). This Order, which was made on 16th March, 1953, under the powersof Defence Regulation 46, prohibits British ships of 500 gross tons or more, notbeing ships registered in the self-governing countries of the Commowealth, fromproceeding to sea&apos;on voyages to China or North Korea without a licence underthe Order.In C. (53) 80 it was stated that the Order could&quot; be made without resorting to new legislation in the United Kingdom, although legislation would probably benecessary in certain Colonies to enable them to take proceedings (if there were acontravention of the Order) against shipowners and masters domiciled there.The Order is now in force, but further examination has disclosed that legis-lation in the Colonies would not be adequate to provide for its effective enforcementthere. If there is an offence under the Order, it is committed at the moment when a ship proceeds to sea, from whatever port, but Colonial legislation couldonly provide for enforcement against ships proceeding to sea from the Colonyitself, since a Colony has no power to make laws having extra-territorial effect.Accordingly no provision could be made by a. Colony to cover the case of a shipproceeding to sea in contravention of the Order from a port outside the Colony.A possibility which has been explored is the use of powers under Section 4 (2)of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, which authorised the making ofan Order in Council to provide inter alia for the apprehension, trial and punish-ment in the Colonies of persons offending against any Defence Regulation.Unfortunately, the Law Officers have now advised that these powers are no longerexercisable. If this is so, the only alternative appears to be United kingdom legislation, if the Order is to be enforceable in the Colonies.So long as the present position continues, there is always the possibility thata British ship which is managed in, and normally operated from, a Colony mightcontravene the Control of Trade by Sea (China and North Korea) Order. The &quot;Government would then be powerless to prosecute either the manager or the masterunless they could be found in the United Kingdom. This would be most fortunate, because the occurrence of even one unpunished offence would leave us open to the criticism from other countries, and particularly the United States,that our much-vaunted licensing control was, in fact, an empty shell.If, therefore, there is no possibility in the present state of the law (as the LawOfficers advise) of using the powers under Section 4 (2) of the 1939 Act, we must ask our colleagues to approve the immediate introduction of an appropriate Bill.We cannot disguise our distaste for such legislation which would inevitably showto the world, and particularly to the Americans, that there is a gap in our powers.We should much prefer to use the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act and risk ourpowers being questioned., O. L.L.A. L.-B.18th June, 1953.44379
