(53) 34thConclusions, Minute 2).Two Questions have now been put down for answer in the House of commons on Wednesday, 17th June, and I circulate a draft of the proposed answer.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,15th June, 1953.
No. 54. &apos; Major Tufton Beamish: To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,if he will make a full statement on the subject of British Trade with China andother Communist countries; and how far such trade has been within the united nations&apos; resolutions on the subject.i Mr. Thomas Reid: To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign-Affairs j&apos; &quot;*J&apos; what &quot;official representations have been made to Her Majesty&apos;&amp; Goverhmehtliirespect of the detailed charges made in the United States of America.by the senate Investigating Committee about British ships carrying ChihesV &quot;troops&apos;and strategic materials to China; and if he will make a statement 6n the subject.With permission I will answer questions No. 54 and No. 56 together.I welcome this opportunity of making our position clear on the question of.British trade with China.We stand by the United Nations Resolution of 18th May, 195.1, which called for an embargo on the supply of strategic goods to China and we are carryingit out with rigour. Lists of strategic materials are co-ordinated by a group ofnations of which the United States is one. We have recently still further tightenedup our controls. Ships on United Kingdom or Colonial registers require licences for any voyage to a Chinese port or between Chinese ports. If any of our ships were to contravene these regulations they would be liable to be hunted down on thehigh seas by British naval vessels and their managers and masters would becomeliable to severe penalties.We have no power to apply these measures to ships flying other flags, but wehave taken steps to ensure that no ship of any nation can be bunkered in portsunder our.control unless we are satisfied that it is not carrying strategic materials to China.So long as the United Nations Resolution of 18th May, 1951, is in force, weshall continue these policies.With regard to goods which are not the subject of these security controls it isthe policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to develop trade with the countries ofthe Soviet bloc, and with. China. We cannot live without trade and we considerthat this trade in non-strategic goods is to the advantage of the free world. Irepeat that the goods which we allow to be exported or carried to China by shipsflying our flag are all goods which are not on the lists of strategic materials towhich I have referred.It has been alleged that Chinese Communist troops have been carried inBritish ships since the Central People&apos;s Government of China undertook operations in Korea in the autumn of 1950.So far as ships flying the British flag are concerned, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment believe that any such allegation is completely unfounded.Reference has been made to two ships called the Perico and the Miramar.These were under the Panamanian flag at the time of the incidents in question in.1951 and 1952. They were neither flying nor entitled to fly the British flag andtherefore were not subject to British law.So far as ships flying foreign flags are concerned, the fact that a british national or company may own shares or have an interest in a foreign companyowning a vessel does not give Her Majesty&apos;s Government any legal control overthe vessel, or entitle that vessel to fly the British flag. In such cases the controlrests with the country whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly:[It is true that on one occasion in June 1951 the Perico did carry Chinese troops from Kwang Chau Wan to Canton. This action was forced upon the master ofthe ship by the threat of violence if he did not comply. The master, who was a norwegian, reported the incident on his return to the authorities in Hong Kong,and in the event the Panamanian Government cancelled the registration of the ship in 1951.][It has been suggested that the Miramar arrived at Shanghai during June 1952with Communist troops on board. From August 1951 this vessel was under the effective control of the Chinese Communists and had been prevented by them fromreturning to Hong Kong. The Panamanian registry of the Miramar was cancelledin August 1952.]At the time of both these incidents, the beneficial ownership of these ships didnot rest with British concerns.The answer to the question asked by the Honourable Member for Swindon isthat no official representations have been received from the United States Govern-ment about these allegations. -
