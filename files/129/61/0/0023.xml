(TIHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 173 COPY NO. ^313TH JUNE, 1953CABINETTHE ST. LEGER, 1953Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and PowerSince 1947 the Jockey Club have, at the request of the Government, run the St. Leger at Doncaster on a Saturday instead of on its traditional Wednesday;it was estimated that if the race were held on a weekday, high absenteeism would lose substantial quantities of coal.2.     We have naturally been anxious to stop interfering in this way and we had hoped that this year an improvement in the coal situation or a re-arrangement of miners&apos; holidays would have made it unnecessary to ask the Jockey Club notto hold the St. -&quot;Leger on Wednesday, 9th September.3.      The coal situation in the autumn is, however, causing us much anxiety.Many, but not all, Yorkshire miners have arranged to take their annual holidayin Leger week this year, but the loss of output through holding the St. Leger ona weekday would not be confined to Yorkshire alone;  there would be furtherlosses in the neighbouring coalfields of Northumberland, Durham and the EastMidlands.    Many miners from these coalfields attend the St. Leger and specialbus trips to Doncaster are always arranged for the day of the race.4.      By itself we think this loss of coal production would have providedsufficient grounds for asking the Jockey Club to run the race on a Saturday,particularly since we have already lost a considerable amount of coal as aresult of the Coronation holiday.    But another consideration seemed to us evenmore important.    Everything possible must be done to encourage the pit by pitcampaign for increased production now going on.    The most important part ofthis campaign is the development of a sense of real urgency among the miners.If the St. Leger were this year run in the middle of the week, for the first timefor 7 years, the effect would inevitably be most unfortunate.5.      We were therefore brought reluctantly to&apos;the conclusion that the St. Legershould again be run on a Saturday - a view which was strongly urged by theChairman of the National Coal Board - and the Minister asked the Stewards ofthe Jockey Club to change the date of the race to Saturday, 12th September.    Hehas since had discussions with them and with representatives of the DoncasterCorporation.    The Stewards were reluctant to agree to his request on thegrounds that the new arrangements for miners&apos; holidays will avoid a loss of coal and the Corporation argued that the running of the St. Leger on a Saturday hasa detrimental effect on the business of Doncaster trades people and createstraffic congestion in the town.
6.        As we have explained, the new holiday arrangements reduce, but by nomeans eliminate, the loss of coal production and,while running the race on aSaturday would certainly cause some local inconvenience, it is noteworthy thatit has also been urged by the Doncaster Chamber of Commerce at the requestof local manufacturers.    The point about traffic congestion has been investigated by the Ministry of Transport who report that it is not a substantialreason against holding the race on a Saturday.7.      The Ministers arguments have not removed the misgivings of theStewards and the Corporation, but the Senior Steward has now written to him that &quot;if it is the unanimous wish of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, then theStewards feel that they must agree to your request to have the St. Leger onthe Saturday&quot;.    The coal situation gives us no option but to press the request;but we would like to know that our colleagues agree.L.G.L.13TH JUNE, 1953.
