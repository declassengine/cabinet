TELEVISION policy note by the Secretary of the Cabinet.At their meeting on 19th May the Cabinet agreed that the 3.B.C.should be allowed to proceed, from 1st July, 19-3, with their television development plans and that commercial television companies should be free to come into operation eighteen months after that date (0.0.(53) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 5).   They invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the television Committee, with the addition of the Commonwealth Secretary, toconsider the precise terms in which the Governments decision should be announced at the end of June.   They also invited the Postmaster-General toarrange that publication of the report of the Television Advisory Committee,and of the B.B.C,&apos;s proposed statement of their future plans, should be deferred until the same time.2. The Television Committee met on 8th June and invited the HomeSecretary, who presided over their meeting in the absence of theChancellor of the Exchequer, to seek the Prime minister&apos;s approval of thefollowing time -table: -16th June:   Statement by the 3.B.C. on their long-term development plans.18th June:   (i) Publication of the Television Advisory Committee&apos;sR.eport.(ii) Statements in Parliament of the Governmentsdecisions on B.B.C. development and commercialtelevision..IThe Committee also considered a draft of the Parliamentary statements and invited the Postmaster &quot;General to prepare a re &quot;draft in the light of their discussion.3. Public discussion about commercial television has, however, beenstimulated again by the television of the Coronation here and in the UnitedStates;  and the Prime Minister has decided that the Cabinet should have anopportunity to review their earlier decision before any announcement ofGovernment policy is made.   Wednesday, 17th June, is the earliest date on whichthe Cabinet can consider this matter; and the Postmaster^General is thereforearranging for the proposed time-table of announcements to be put back forone week.I attach the latest draft of the Parliamentary statement, prepared in thelight of the Television Committee&apos;s discussion.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.12th JUNE,   1953.(LCOPY NO.CABINET. secret.(53) 17012th JUNE,. 1953.
STATEMENT ON TELEVISION DEVBLOFxyiEMTTO 3E MADE BY THE pOSTMAST E R &quot;GENF-RALIN THE HOUSE OF LORDS;I. In early 1951 the late Government placed a ban on further majorcapital development of television by the B.B.C.  The present government decided when they took office in October, 1951 that the financial and economic condition of the country made it necessary to continue the ban.   some temporary stations were authorised for the Coronation, although the Governmenthad regretfully to limit their number.   I can however now announce that, inthe light of present circumstances, Her lviajesty&apos;s Government agree that theB.B.C. should proceed on 1st July with certain projects that will maketelevision available to another 6-7 million people and to begin shortly afterwards to use Very High Frequencies (V.H.F.) to help to improve the soundservices in areas where it is not now satisfactory.2. The specific projects are:-(1)    5 low-power stations -Aberdeen, Belfast, Isle of Wight, Plymouth and Pontop Pike.(2)    Removal of London station to Crystal Palace.(3)    Stations to serve Channel Isles and Isle of Man.(4)    Start with V.H.F. - the Television Advisory Committee mustreport before final details can be settled.All the first three items will be ready for service at, or shortly after, the endof 1954, except the new London station which will probably come on the airsome time later.3. This release of resources to the B.B.C. raises the question of when weshould start with commercial television which will enlarge the public&apos;s choicewithout in any way affecting the excellent service they now receive and willcontinue to receive from the B.3.C.  In last year&apos;s White Paper on Broadcasting,Her majesty&apos;s Government said that the B.B.C. should be permitted a startbefore competitive services were allowed.   This was in fairness to the 3.B.C.and also in order to make sure that limited resources should not be used for providing a second - that is commercial - television programme, say for london, before other large areas had even one programme.   It will take abouteighteen months to put on the market adaptors for existing television sets forviewing new programmes.   From the practical point of view therefore the3.B.C. have that period to get ahead with the developments I have describedbefore they have to face competition.   As this period would in any case give theB.B.C, a reasonable start from the point of view of policy we propose.to issuelicences, on terms to be approved by Parliament, to commercial concerns tobe on the air after the eighteen months, i. e. not earlier than January 1955.4. In the White Paper, Her majesty&apos;s Government undertook to submit toParliament before licensing the first station, the terms and conditions underwhich competitive television would operate.   As a first step, a White Paper willbe presented in the autumn setting out the general lines on which the licenceswill be drafted, and the constitution and powers of the controlling body whichmust be set up soon afterwards.   There are, however, certain points of principle on which I can now indicate the Governments general feelings.
5,       First, as the Government decided to allow competitive televisionbecause they dislike monopoly, there can be no question of granting anything like a monopoly for advertising, whether on a local or national scale, to anycommercial concern.   We intend to follow the example of Commonwealth countries and the U.S.A., and limit the number of stations controlled by any one company.6. Secondly, the success of the experiment may well depend largely onits being initiated in a steady and orderly manner.   We propose therefore not toissue more than a limited number of licences during the first year;  and during that period it is unlikely that any one concern would be given a licence for morethan one station.7. Thirdly, as regards frequencies, I have studied the valuable report ofthe Television Advisory Committee.   In brief, television broadcasting in thiscountry will develop in future in three separate ranges or bands of frequencies,in. addition to that now in use.   Techniques for the two higher ranges are notyet fully developed in this country and it is only for the lowest of the threebands that sets or adaptors, and transmitting equipment, can be producedreasonably quickly.   In this range however only two channels are at present available for broadcasting, and questions about the ultimate use of the whole bandare therefore hypothetical at present.   We propose that the permanent use ofthese limited frequencies should be - as the Television Advisory Committeerecommends - mainly for stations covering large areas.   For the time being,however, our concern is with the two available channels and we should beprepared to consider favourably their use by those who wish to start withrelatively short-range commercial television in 1955, on the understanding thatthose services might have to be transferred to higher- frequencies, after a specified number of years and when the techniques for these frequencies havebeen further developed.8. Fourthly, television is generally recognised to be a tremendous forcein forming national opinion and standards of taste and values.   The Government donot therefore contemplate issuing licences to concerns that are not registered,financed and controlled in this country.9. Fifthly, I am authorised by the President of the Board of Trade to saythat the Government accept the Copyright Committee rs recommendation on the granting to broadcasting authorities of a performing right in television programmes,and they propose to grant this right in the copyright legislation which they hope to introduce in due course.   This should help both broadcasting authoritiesand sporting promoters and organisation  to deal with the problem of copyright.I should, however, make it clear, that, as suggested in the White Paper, stepswill be taken to discourage anyone from trying to buy up or exploit exclusiverights in sporting and other events of special national importance and significance.We are examining ways and means of doing this, but I think that it is desirablethat anyone contemplating negotiations of such a kind should know now of theGovernment&quot;s intentions on this matter.10. In the White Paper on broadcasting it was stated that commercialtelevisors would be precluded from dealing with religion or politics.   Thiswould, of course, make- it impossible for a ceremony such as the Coronationto be part, directly or indirectly, of a sponsored programme.
11.       I cannot close without thanking all the members of the TelevisionAdvisory Committee for the admirable report that has just been published and especially their energetic and resourceful Chairman, Admiral Sir CharlesDaniel, who has done so much to ensure its early presentation.   We owe agreat deal both to him and his colleagues, including the two members from the radio industry.   While on this subject, 1 should like to reassure possiblepurchasers of television sets.   The report speaks of new programmes and newfrequencies.   I am, however, satisfied that for those who wish to listen to commercial television there will be no difficulty in fitting adaptors on currentsets, and in some cases older sets, so that they can receive any secondprogramme that there may be in the near future.   I emphasise this because i want the public to know that when commercial television comes along thecurrent types of television sets will be available for alternativeprogrammes if fitted with suitable adaptors and aerials.12.       To sum up, the B.B.C. can now go ahead with its seven new stations,with the rebuilding of the London Station and the beginning of V.H.F. sound broadcasting.   Licences will be issued to competitive television companies in time to allow them to be on the air in 1955.   A White Paper will be issued in the autumn indicating broadly the proposed terms and conditions of licences for commercial television and the powers, constitution and dutiesof the controlling body.   The White Paper will deal with a number of points ofprinciple and I have indicated today the line which the Government are likelyto take on some of these important questions.
