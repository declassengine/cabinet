(53) 1947th July, 1953CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION AND GERMANYNote by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I circulate for the information of my colleagues the note by the Prime Ministerwhich I read to the Cabinet yesterday during our discussion on policy towardsthe Soviet Union and Germany (C.C. (53) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2).S.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,7th July, 1953.In his masterly and comprehensive survey of the European scene Lord Salis-bury has arrayed many facts with which I am in full agreement. I wish, however,to assign prominence and priority to some of the objects we have in view though,alas, not in hand.E.D.C. is our immediate policy. The French have succeeded in delaying forseveral years the beginning of a German Army by this elaborate logical device.Its ratification must be the prelude to the holding of a four-Power Conference,though not to the declaration of our desire that one should be held.44459
Will the French ratify E.D.C. and if so when? I have heard tney wouldlike to delay it by one device and another until next year, when new reasons fordelay may be discovered. In my opinion, we and the Americans should demandratification&apos; before the end of October. We should warn them&quot; that if this is refusedor does not occur we shall propose a new N.A.T.O. Treaty.in whicn no power would have a veto on the inclusion of a German contingent: This would beformidable pressure on the French and is the most powerful lever at our disposal to induce them to comply and thus abandon the method of taking everything and giving nothing which they have followed since their rescue.With either E.D.C. or a reformed N.A.T.O. (with or without &quot;France&apos;s formaladhesion) we should be in a far better position to talk to Russia than if the presentindefinite delay continued. The prospect of a substantial German Army as a part ofN.A.T.O., through E.D.C., is a profound and legitimate anxiety in Russia. Let ustherefore, as our first aim, persuade the French to ratify E.D.C. in October. this could and should be coupled with a declaration of willingness for a four-power conference before the end of the year.These are objectives which we can certainly pursue at Washington without serious division of British opinion. Whether we can achieve them now or not isdoubtful; at any rate we must try. If the French remain recalcitrant we shouldnot hesitate to. make a joint declaration with the United States that we will meetRussia in conference. If the United States refuses we should reserve our freedom.A friendly conversation between Great Britain and Soviet Russia, even if isolated,would be watched with intense interest and hope and might well lead to an easementin the world tension. Anyhow there could be no meeting before the end of theGerman Elections.Whatever happens about E.D.C. or N.A.T.O., and however Adenauer fares atthe Elections, we shall have to face very soon the problem of German unity. Apregnant paper has been written on this subject by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery.Nothing will turn the German people from unity, and Adenauer himself, although a loyal partisan of E.D.C., is being forced every day to emphasise it more.However the Election goes all the German Parties will be ardent for unity. Thisis surely coming upon us and coming all the quicker from a French desertion ofE.D.C. We must face the fact that there will always be &quot; a German problem &quot; and&quot; a Prussian danger.&quot; I am of opinion that a united, independent Germany wouldnot become allies of Soviet Russia. Three facts stand forth 1. The character of the German people rises superior to the servile conditionsof the Communist world.2. They have had a potent object lesson in the fate of the Eastern Zone andmillions of witnesses will exist for many years to testify to the horrorsof Communist rule, even exercised by Germans over Germans.3. The hatred which Hitler focused against Bolshevism is strong in Germanhearts.The eyes of Germany are turned against Soviet Russia in fear, hate andintellectual antagonism. For France there is only contempt and pity. What isAlsace-Lorraine compared with Silesia and the Western Neisse in Russian hands?
/ am sure that Germany will not, in the next 20 years, join with Russia againstthe West or lose her moral association with the Free Powers: of Europe and america. That, at any rate, is the basis from which we ought to consider ourterrible problem.The Russians have, however, certain very powerful bribes to offer. First, the unity of Germany through the release of the Eastern Zone after free elections.Second, a readjustment of the frontiers at the expense of Poland. We shall needall our skill so to steer events that we get as much credit for any future advantagesGermany may gain as do the Soviets.Happily, there is no need to initiate any detailed discussion of the future ofGermany at Washington and no hope of reaching agreement upon it. the americans no doubt contemplate in their hearts that in a war between the UnitedStates and the Soviets they would make a firm and lasting alliance with the Germanpeople. What must not be forgotten by us, and will I hope be remembered by the soviets, is the safety of Russia against another Hitlerite invasion. It is along theselines of thought that, without prejudice to other things I have set down, our mindsmight adventurously travel. Of course, the solution is a real U.N.O. where allare bound to aid the victim and attack the aggressive invader. Here is of course the supreme solution, a true World Instrument of peace. For the present :- have only two practical points in Europe the early ratification of E.D.C.followed by a four-Power Conference: the whole policy being simultaneouslyannounced.W. S. C.6th July, 1953.
