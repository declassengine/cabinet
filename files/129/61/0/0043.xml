(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE- PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC - MAJESTY &apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret(53) 193 COPY NO.    6 &amp;7th JUDY, 1953.cabinet coal SUPPLY position memorandum by the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power andthe Minister of Fuel and power the coal supply position this year has been dominated by the factthat the extra holidays taken by the miners involve a loss of between,4-  and 5 million tons of coal,   The Coronation holiday reduced output by 1.2 million tonsand it is expected that the second week&apos;s holiday which the miners are takingfor the first time will entail a further loss of, probably, 3f million tons.2, The output in the last few months of last year was unsatisfactory,owing no doubt to the dissatisfaction of the miners at the rejection of theirwage claim by the Porter Tribunal.   There followed the prolonged negotiationswith the National Coal Board (N.C.B.) which finally led to an agreement, but theoutput for the first three months of this year continued to be unsatisfactory.The agreement between the Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkersincluded provisions for a joint campaign in the weeks preceding Easter inorder to stimulate productivity.   The campaign is having a certain amount ofsuccess.   After Easter the rate of production improved but this improvementlargely consisted in better attendance on Saturdays than last year whenSaturday attendance was poor.   The N.C.B. are urging the National   Union of mineworkers to ensure that the improved Saturday output is maintained forthe rest of the summer.   The best that can be assumed, however, is that output in the remainder of the summer, that is, in the period up to 31st October,will (excluding holidays) be 3 per cent higher than a year ago.   Output fromopencast has been falling in recent months, and some further fall may beexpected.    There have been increasing difficulties in securing agreement tothe working of opencast sites, and we are quite clear that unless these difficulties can be overcome output will suffer seriously.3. While the rate of production has been higher than a year ago, it hasbeen counterbalanced by the loss arising from holidays and there has been avery substantial increase in inland consumption of coal other than house coal.Since the beginning of the summer the increase has been not less than 3f per cent,of which only about f per cent can be accounted for by the colder weather.Consumption by general industry (that is industry other than iron and steel and engineering) has been no less than S per cent higher than a year ago.   We must expect this high rate of industrial demand to continue during the remainder ofthe summer.   Y/e must also assume that merchants&apos; disposal of house coalwill continue at the same rate as a year ago.   Exports are continuing at separately of approximately 1 million tons a month, and we can hope to reach ourrevised export target for the year of 13 million tons.4. The substantial loss due to the second week&apos;s holiday will fallmainly in the months of July and August, which in normal times are stockbuildingd-
months.   This fact must make us most anxious about the prospect forstockbuilding during the summer.   On 20th 3&quot;une distributed stocks were14,371,000 tons, or 1,376,000 tons less than a year ago.   This figure in itself is not too bad and we can expect total distributed stocks at the end of October tobe about 18 million tons.   But within this total there is a serious lack of house coal, stocks of which stood on 20th June at 464,000 tons, comparedwith 766,000 tons a year ago.   Both the railways and the house coal market dependalmost entirely on large coal and every year, owing to the exhaustion of the better seams and the development of mechanisation, the percentage of smallcoal increases and the percentage of large coal decreases.   Between 1948 and 1952there was an increase in total output of 16 million tons but the amount oflarge coal fell by 2 million tons.5. Until recently, we had reason to hope that a house coal stock of2 million tons or so might be achieved by the beginning of the winter,but Sir Hubert Houldsworth, the Chairman of the N.C.B., has now informed us that, even if every possible step is taken to draw off from all sources such asthe gas programme, railway programme and industrial programme all thelarge coal that can be taken without serious disturbance, the stock will not bemuch more than 1 million tons.   This figure would be the lowest in any yearsince the war;   previous corresponding figures were 2 millions in 1946and 1947, 2. 2 millions in 1948,  2.4 millions in 1949,  2 millions in 1950,1.2 millions in 1951 and 2. 1 millions in 1952.   It is quite inadequate especially if next winter is severe or there is any weather bad enough to interfere with transport by rail or sea.   The last thing we could contemplate in our third year of office would be a serious domestic coal shortage.   We must thereforeconclude that we are faced with a choice between two disagreeable alternatives.6. The first of these is to curtail exports.   In the remainder of this yearexports on present plans are expected to be of the order of 6 million tons,of which about 2 million tons will be large coal.   Much of this large coal would anyhow be unsuitable for the house coal market.   In many of the contractsmade by the N.C.B., which are in consequence of bilateral trade agreements,the large coal is a necessary ingredient because otherwise the small coalcould not be sold;  at least an equivalent quantity of small coals finds a market-be cause of the supplies of large coals which are sold with them.   Thus, if million tons of large coal were withdrawn from exports in the next sixmonths for the house coal market, it might mean a total reduction of 2 million tons.This in turn might mean the collapse of many of the contracts which the N.C.B.has made, and this v/ould cause serious difficulties in our trade relationswith many countries.   The N.C.3. have done what they can to reduce thevolume of large coal shipped abroad and though the total of exports is greaterthan a year ago the volume of large coal shipped is the same and therefore a smaller percentage of the total.7. After the unhappy experience of 1950, when Lord Hyndley, the thenChairman of the N.C.B., toured Europe begging to be released from hisexport contracts, it may be assumed that any serious curtailment of our exports would go far to destroy the possibility of resuming coal exports from the United Kingdom on a substantial scale.   To have fallen down on contractstwice in four years might irretrievably damage the reputation of this country as a coal exporter.8. The other alternative is to authorise the N.C.B. to import large coal.It is understood that supplies of the particular kinds of coal of which we areshort may be available in France, Belgium and the Saar, where indeed there isalready short time working, and there maybe supplies of suitable coal also available in Poland.   For political reasons the last country might have to be&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
/3Sruled out.   A marginal purchase of these particular qualities of coal fromthose countries would be a step towards the development of that closer association with the European Coal and Steel Community which Her I-/Jajesty&apos;sGovernment have announced they wish to foster.   Undoubtedly the mereannouncement that the United Kingdom is importing coal will give rise to somedisquiet, but in the present very difficult position it would be preferable to face this disquiet in July rather than risk an almost inevitable crisis at thebeginning of next year.9. The amount of coal that would require to be imported to make our stocks of house coal reasonably safe would be about 1 million tons, but theN,C,3. would not be authorised to go above f million tons unless it was clearthat our stock position  demanded it.10, From the point of view of the country&apos;s balance of payments itseems far better to import coal than to curtail coal exports.   The rough cal-culations    that have been made show that the cost of the imports would beof the order of  2-f to  3 millions.   On the other hand, to reduce exports byf million tons of large coal would entail a loss of over  3 millions.   Inaddition, there would be the loss arising from the reduction in the export ofthe small coals (which are pinked with the large coals), which would probablybe not less than  2 millions.   And, of course, to curtail exports now might mean continuing losses of foreign exchange in future years.11. We think that the balance of advantage lies in now authorising theN.C.B, to make contracts for the importation of such large coal from western european countries and we ask our colleagues to agree.L.G.L..7th July, 1953.
