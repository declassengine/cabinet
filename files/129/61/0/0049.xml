Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1953SECRETC. (53) 19920th July, 1953Copy No.67CABINETCOAL PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Secretary for the Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and power at this meeting on 9th July, the Cabinet asked us to report on the prospects for coal production and consumption, taking into account various points that hadbeen raised in their discussion of C. (53) 193 (C.C. (53) 4lst Conclusions, Minute 7).This is a matter which we constantly have under consideration with the national coal Board. We have now had further discussion with Sir Hubert Houldsworth,the Chairman of the Board, and have considered the Board&apos;s latest forwardestimates of production and consumption.2. From the estimates shown in Annex I the Board draw the general conchasion that inland consumption may, in 1954, be about 4 million tons above the 1953level, and that total output may be up by between 1 and 5 million tons. Thus, onthe higher of the two figures of output, and assuming exports at the present annuallevel of 13 million tons, the account would be about in balance; on the lower figurethere would be a substantial deficit.3. Clearly everything possible must be done to achieve at least the higher figure of output. We believe that it can be achieved; indeed, it does not entail morethan a rate of effort which was found possible in terms of attendance in 1952 andin terms of output per man-shift in 1951, but which at the present time the minersare not giving us. We propose to convey to Sir Hubert Houldsworth the paramountneed to achieve at least this, and indeed to do better. In the years up to 1951 anannual improvement in output per man-shift of over 2 per cent, was the average, andif we could achieve in 1954 an improvement of this percentage in comparison with1951 we should have another 3J million tons.4. On opencast, however, the Board&apos;s estimate of 11 million tons for 1954may turn out to be excessive by 1 million tons or more, in particular if the board are prevented from obtaining new sites. At the moment, sites representing artannual output of 2 to 3 million tons are in suspense for one reason or another, andwe shall be in difficulties unless clearance is quickly obtained. This is a matter thatwe have already taken up with those of our colleagues who are specially concerned,and it is unfortunately the case that we shall not achieve our opencast estimatesWithout the sacrifice of some good agricultural land.5. So much for next year&apos;s prospects. There are so many variables andunknowns that no one can make any useful estimates of output and consumptionfor more than a year or so ahead. There is, however, reason to hope that the fuelefficiency drive which we can expect from the new Industrial Fuel Efficiency Organi-sation, supported by the recently extended Government loan scheme, will lessen the increase in inland consumption sufficiently to enable combined home and export demand to be met by the increase of output resulting year by year from thehigher productivity induced by capital investment. There is a note by the national coal Board on capital investment in Annex II. The Board clearly understand theimportance of capital investment as a means of securing increased output (at theprice, of course, of increased capital charges), and they know that restrictions will44511B
not be placed by the Government on increased investment. The limiting factor isshortage of mining engineers and, although the position is improving, it will be some years before there are sufficient trained staff to meet the industry&apos;s require-ments both for development and for day-to-day management.6. Capital investment will not, however, solve our main problem, which isthe shortage of large coal. Year by year, notwithstanding an increased total out-put, the output of large coal becomes smaller, owing partly to the exhaustion ofthe richer seams but mainly to the breakage of coal that results from increasedmechanisation, and it will become progressively more serious as mechanisationproceeds. There is very little that can be done by the National Coal Board andthey have warned us, first, that even on the higher estimate of output for 1954there will be a large coal deficit of 2 million tons and, secondly, that these deficitsmust be expected to continue, and probably increase, in future years.7. What then is our best course of action? Must we cut our exports, orcontinue importing coal, or can we hope to get into balance again by reducing the inland consumption of large coal? This last objective is what we must do our utmost to achieve. For that purpose we need such a revolution in the age-longhabits of the chief consumers of large coal, namely the householder and the rail-ways, that they will change over to other grades of coal and to other forms of fuel.8. Householders will be most reluctant to make this change: 80 per cent,of them prefer open fires burning large coal and they will tend to stick to theirpreference whatever we say or do. We have recently taken action in twodirections:(a) the best coal has been made more expensive and the lower gradescheaper;(b) the approval of a new coke marketing scheme should encourage theuse of coke.But habits die hard and we doubt whether by themselves these measures will provesufficiently effective. Householders can reasonably argue, first, that most of theirexisting fire grates are suitable for nothing but large coal and, secondly, that thereare 8 million rent-controlled houses where there is no real inducement to instalimproved grates. While this remains true, progress will be far too slow, and weare therefore raising with the Ministers concerned the question of an appreciabletaxation allowance to landlords who are prepared to provide their premises withup-to-date equipment.9. The railways are in a different position. They appreciate the need to relyless on large coal and our only doubt is whether their contribution will be sufficientto influence the position in the short term. The change to diesel traction (forshunting purposes) and the extension of electrification will help, but we doubt whether this will save more than 4- million tons of large coal a year even in a fewyears time.10. The main immediate contribution from the railways will be to use thesmaller kinds of coal that are in better supply. They have already agreed to take&quot; double nuts &quot; at a rate of about \ million tons a year, but the prospect of doingmuch more on these lines is limited, particularly by the design of existing railwayengines in this country, which is quite unsuitable for small coal. The railway executive have under consideration proposals that no appliance built in future for use on the railways (locomotives, stoves, &amp;c.) shall be designed to use large coal only, but clearly it will be a long time before the existing stock of 20,000locomotives, each with a life of about 40 years, is replaced. We conclude there-fore that the most hopeful solution lies in a considerable extension of the use bythe railways of briquettes manufactured from small coal. The railways are atpresent taking these briquettes at the rate of \ million tons a year and have already agreed to double that rate.11.   Nevertheless, the fact remains that (a) we need another 4 to 5 million tons a year before we can hope to end therestrictions on household coal;(b) our yearly supplies of this coal are how falling at the rate of 1 to 2 million tons a year.
What we really want, therefore, is a reduction of the present rate of railwayconsumption of large coal (about 14 million tons a year), by some 5 million tonsover the next two years or so, as a major contribution to the solution of our problem.12. Whether this will be possible we cannot at present say and we are making further urgent investigations; but if. we are unable to find a solution we shallinevitably be faced again next year, and afterwards, with an unpleasant choice between cutting our exports or importing large coal.13. While, then, the overall position is reasonably satisfactory if the national coal Board can get the miners to attend as regularly and work as hard as theydid a year or two ago, the shortage of large coal raises problems to which we arenot yet within sight of a complete solution. A determined and continuing effort will be needed before we have enough large coal both for export and to enable usto relieve householders of the present irksome restrictions. The main lines on whichwe are proceeding are, first, to encourage the domestic consumer to install gratescapable of burning smaller coal (and for this an incentive will have to be found) and,secondly, to explore urgently the possibilities of. use by the railways of briquettes ona very much larger scale.14. There remains the question, whether changes in the organisation of theNational Coal Board would result in a more vigorous policy in developing our coalresources. Though shortage of managerial staff of first class quality imposes limits which must be respected, there is no doubt that some further decentralisation fromHeadquarters and the Divisional Boards to the Area General Managers would bethe right course. But this would not, over the next few years, provide much morecoal. Indeed, if the changes appeared to the miners to have been influenced bythe Government there is, as some of the speeches at the recent Miners&apos; Conferenceshowed, the danger of a violent reaction which might lose us a great deal of coal and land us in severe difficulties. The timing and handling of this matter must beleft to the National Coal Board. Matters are now well advanced, thoughSir Hubert Houldsworth is having no easy task to convince some of his colleagues on the Board; and we expect that in a month-or two, before Parliament reassembles,some useful changes will be announced.L.G.

Capital InvestmentNote by the National Coal board the Board&apos;s total capital expenditure in the five months ended 30th May, 1953,was  20 millions, of which  18-7 millions was on collieries and associated works and 1 - 3 millions on coke ovens. The total expenditure for the corresponding periodof 1952 was  14-8 millions, of which  14-1 millions was on collieries and  0-7 million on coke ovens.2. The Board&apos;s National Plan provided for an expenditure of  40 millions in1953 on collieries and  4 millions on associated activities (i.e., excluding coke ovens).This is equivalent to about  63 millions at current price levels. It is not expectedthat actual expenditure will reach this figure, but 1953 will show a substantial improvement on previous years and 1954 should show a further improvement.3. A further indication of progress is the increasing expenditure on major schemes. The following table shows the expenditure on schemes costing over 500,000: --   Million1947        ......      ...      .......      ...      0-6&apos;     1948 ..............      ...      ...      1-71949.................      ...      ...      ......      4-41950       ... .....      ......      ...      6 11951 &apos;&apos; ...    ... ....., ...    ...    8-41952      ...     ......     ... ...    14-1It is expected that the 1953 figure will be higher than that for 1952.4. Amongst the schemes that have been approved to date are 10 big newcollieries and 6 big new surface mines.5. Although the situation is improving, the rate of progress in colliery recon-struction is still inadequate and there are heavy arrears to overtake. It is impossibleto ascribe delay in reconstruction to any single factor. In general, it is due more to shortage of the necessary skilled people than to defects in organisation. Themost serious shortage is in engineering staff of all types for the planning and execu-tion of this work. In addition, there were serious effects in the earlier years fromshortage of materials and the difficulties caused by competing demands of current production.6. In the Reid Report (Cmd. 6610 of 1945) it was emphasised that there werenot enough qualified engineers in the industry to undertake technical reconstructionon the scale required. The programme of reconstruction and new sinkings resultingfrom the reasessment of the problem after nationalisation is even greater than thatcontemplated in the Reid Report. Something can be, and is being, done by bring-ing in outside help, especially in the civil engineering field, but the main shortage isof mining engineering staff. Fully qualified mining engineers cannot be recruitedand trained in a short time and, although the position has progressively improved, itwill be some years before there are sufficient trained staff to meet the industry&apos;s requirements for both planning and day-to-day management,. In present circum-stances there are obvious limits to the extent to which skilled mining engineeringtalent can be diverted from the problems of immediate production to those of reconstruction; yet a measure of such diversion is essential if the future is not to behopelessly mortgaged, and the Board have recently taken steps which should bringabout an improvement.7. Some of the delay in reconstruction has been due in the past to shortages of steel which affected the coal industry along with all other industries. although this particular shortage has now been overcome, its effects are still apparent, andhave led to delays in the progress of individual schemes which cannot easily bemade good.8. It must be borne in mind that the large bulk of the reconstructionprogramme has to be carried out at collieries which are continuing in productionall the time; there are physical limitations (e.g., winding capacity) on the rate atwhich reconstruction, pan be carried through in such cases without seriously inter-fering with current output. .........
