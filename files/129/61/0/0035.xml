secret cabinet the attached paper will be considered at tomorrow*s meeting of the Cabinetunder Item 3 of the Agenda.Cabinet Office, S-.W.1.30th June, 1953.
IxyLTELEVISION development memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I am concerned about the suggestion at the end of the final draft state-ment on television development circulated by the Postmaster &quot;General on 26th June(C. (53) 182) that licences issued to operators of television stations might specify&quot;the proportion, if any, of imported programme material to be permitted &quot;,I believe that this suggestion, in its present form, however tentative, would giverise to much uncertainty and harmful speculation;    and that the Government wouldbe ill-advised to commit themselves publicly to any such possibility until the implications have been fully examined and assessed.2. The following questions seem to me to be relevant:-(i)     Is the purpose of the restriction (a) to protect home suppliers of television material and entertainment (e.g. telefilm producers, script&quot;writers, actors and actresses, etc.) against foreign suppliers andartistes;  or (b) to enable some kind of censorship to be exercised over foreign material;  or (c) solely to restrict the amount of foreignadvertising matter which may be included in programmes?(ii) Is it desirable that a restriction should be applied to foreign material for such purposes?(iii) Is it practicable to operate and enforce such a restriction?   In particular,what is it intended to cover by &quot;imported programme material&quot; and howwould such material be defined and distinguished?   On what basis would any permitted proportion be calculated?3. As I understand the proposal, the restriction would be operated by thePostmaster-General or the Controlling Body requiring each operator not to broadcast from his station more than a specified percentage of &quot;importedprogramme material&quot;.   It will, I am sure, be recognised that it would be quite impracticable to administer a control of this kind by licensing at port of entryas in the case of imported merchandise.4. As this proposal appears to raise a major issue of policy, I would strongly recommend to my colleagues that the passage in question should be deleted from the statement.   Full consideration could, of course, be given to thisquestion separately, perhaps on the basis of a paper submitted by the Postmaster-General.   I do not rule out the possibility that we may in the end find it necessaryto protect the interests of British film producers in relation to television by measures parallel to the present legislation which establishes a screen quotain cinemas, though that legislation itself has very many unsatisfactory features.SECRET ,C. (53) 185 COPY NO. K&amp; -J30th JUNE, 1953.CABINET
But to include such a passage now would expose us to pressures frominterested parties before we were satisfied on the merits of such a proposal, oreven informed on the facts to be taken into account in considering it.This would be the more embarrassing if indeed what the Postmaster-general has in mind is protection of the public against imported material not,or not principally, because it is imported, but as a concession to those whoassume a priori that imported material may be expected to be deleteriousto public taste and morals.P.T.Board of Trade, S,W.l.30th June, 1953.
