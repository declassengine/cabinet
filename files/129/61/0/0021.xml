Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1953SECRETCopy No.63C. (53) 17112th June, 1953CABINETTELEVISION DEVELOPMENTNote by the Secretary of the cabinet before he left for the United States the Foreign Secretary had a short discus-sion with the Prime Minister on the subject of sponsored television. He desired thathis views should be known to his colleagues when this matter came before theCabinet again. By the Prime Minister^ direction I am circulating the followingsummary of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views.Mr. Eden is firmly opposed to sponsored television in this country. He agrees with the letter which appeared in the Times of 4th June over the signatures of lord halifax, Lord Waverley and others. He considers that the high quality of sponsoredtelevision in the United States offers no parallel for this country. In the UnitedStates the big industrial and manufacturing interests live by the home market andare consequently ready to put large sums of money into this form of advertising,competing with one another to keep the standard up. This is not so in the UnitedKingdom, where export markets are the prime concern of manufacturers. Conse-quently Mr. Eden believes that if sponsored television were introduced in thiscountry it would probably be run mainly by newspaper proprietors. He fears thatthis could only be detrimental to the quality and standards of television broad-casting. He does not think that a Conservative Government ought to introduce ameasure which might adversely affect the taste and education of the people.(Signed)NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th June, 1953.44353
