REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF ministers on SUPPLY EXPENDITUREWe were appointed by a decision of the Cabinet on 3rd February, 1953, withthe following terms of reference:  &quot;To review in the light of the discussion the proposals put forward inC. (53) 31 for reducing Government expenditure in the coming financial year,and thereafter to consider what further measures could be put in hand witha view to securing further reductions in Government expenditure in the vearsahead.&quot;We reported in C. (53) 47 on the first part of our task and the Cabinet subsequentlytook decisions, the outcome of which was reflected in the Estimates for the current year.2. We have since held further meetings to consider the longer-term problem.In these we have been assisted by discussions with the Minister of National insurance and the Minister of Education in regard to matters falling within their respectivefields.  They have also furnished us with memoranda on particular points.3. As background to the consideration of particular subjects, and in orderto assess the broad trend of Government expenditure in the immediate future, we obtained from the Treasury forecasts of the probable level of such expenditure in1954-55 and 1955-56. Details of these forecasts, which are necessarily of a con-jectural character, are set out in Appendices I and II. Another forecast, even more highly conjectural, showing the probable level of expenditure on the Social services in ten years&apos; time, is contained in Appendices III and IV. These forecasts indicatethat even at present price levels we are faced with a prospective increase in total supply expenditure of nearly  400 millions over the next two years; of this, nearly 100 millions is connected with the social services, and  240 millions is on total defence preparations. (The latter increase is partly due to the fact that whereas the 1953-54 figure takes credit for  140 millions counterpart of Defence Aid,nothing is included for this in subsequent years. It is probable that we shall receive a reduced amount of general aid from the United States in 1954-55, butit will not be called &quot; Defence Aid &quot; and the method of treating the counterpart, ifany, will have to be agreed with the Americans after Congress has approved the appropriation. Any such aid received in 1955-56 will certainly be very small.)Both the  400 millions and the  100 millions increases are probably too low,because-(a) for our own purposes it would be wise to assume that after June 1954 weshall have to bear in full the local costs of our forces in Germany,although we should be careful to adopt a different attitude in negotia-tions with other countries(b) the increased Exchequer contribution to the National Insurance Funds,which may well be necessary in the near future, has not been included(c) no allowance has been made for increased prices or for increased pension and benefit rates although additional expenditure under one or other ofthese heads seems likely-  (d) provision for new or unforeseen items (e.g., flood relief) is almost- certain to be required.4. For the longer term, the ten-year forecast shows that social service pay-ments (from the Exchequer) by themselves (including an increase of  215 millions in the Exchequer contribution to National Insurance Funds) are likely to rise bysome  400 millions (or one-third) by the end of the period; the main assumptionsunderlying this forecast are that present policies are maintained, that wages and prices and unemployment are stable at present levels, that present population trendscontinue and that financial relations with local authorities remain much as atpresent. .5. These forecasts, which are, of course, based on assumptions Which maynot in the end be fulfilled, nevertheless indicate clearly that the budgetary problems arising in the future are likely to be of the gravest character and that the need for early remedial action to limit or reduce prospective expenditure is compelling.Even after the budget the present load of taxation undoubtedly bears heavily on industry; doubts as to whether investment will be profitable and lack of incentive to take risks owing to high levels of taxation obviously must have a restrictiveeffect on industrial development.
6. The figures so far given refer to Government Supply expenditure, i.e., thecost to the Government, broadly. speaking, of the current running; of government services other than service of the National Debt. At the same time, we must remember other demands on the Exchequer in relation to capital account, viz.for loans from the Exchequer (housing, education, new towns, coal, &amp;c.) or forguarantees for loans raised on the market (electricity, gas, &amp;c). The raising of loans of the magnitude now demanded places a severe strain on the market andrenders difficult the orderly management of our very large national debt. It isnot the purpose of the present report to discuss the possibility of reduction ofthese capital requirements. But their existence must be borne in mind in consider -ing Supply expenditure.7. Against this background, the conclusion inescapably emerges that as aGovernment we are in danger of doing too much at once. We have, therefore,in this report indicated the main fields to which we must look for economies ofthe magnitude required. In our view they are:  (i) Defence Preparations.(ii) Food Subsidies.(iii) Health Services.(iv) Education.(v) Housing.(vi) National Insurance.(vii) National Assistance.8. In the 1953-54 Budget provision for these services amounts to  2,934millions (80 per cent.) out of total Supply expenditure of  3,586 millions. In the forecast for 1955-56 they account -for  3,254 millions (82 per cent.) out of acorresponding total of  3,971 millions. We comment briefly on each of them in thefollowing paragraphs.9.   Defence Preparations (including Civil Defence, Industrial Capacity (Defence)and Strategic Reserves)  million1953-54 Provision      ......      ...      ...      ...      1,6351955-56 Forecast        ......      ...      ...      ...      1,877** Excluding any additional costs in respect of forces in Germany.We consider that against the general background which we have described we must decide to effect the maximum possible savings.10. Food Subsidies  million1953-54 Provision................      ...      2211955-56       ...............      ......      231(The 1955-56 figure is merely that which would be necessary to keep the Ministryof Food&apos;s selling prices at the level assumed for 1953-54).Of the 1953-54 total the main constituents are :    millionBread ...      ............      ...      ... ...      45Milk (ordinary consumer).........&apos;.      ... ...      40         -Welfare schemes.........      ...... ...     46Agricultural Subsidies............... 36It is our objective to get rid of controls as rapidly as possible, and as freedomis incompatible with the continuance of subsidies, provision for the latter shouldbe progressively reduced. In any case, only by the removal of subsidies can price levels be made more realistic and the economy less artificial.11. Health Services  million1953-54 Provision     .........      ...      ...      ...      4111955-56 Forecast   ..........      ...      ...    ....      433.,1963-64 Long-range forecast     ...      ...      ,.v     ...     .462We must await the outcome of the independent enquiry before reaching;conclusions on this service. Clearly, however, we must not shrink from unpleasant decisionsif these are necessary to restrict expenditure to a level which we can sustain.44327 b 2      &apos;;
12. Education (including universities)1953-54 Provision  million286Universities  million271955-56 Forecast      ......      ...      ...      312 301963-64 Long-range forecast        ......      368 42The substantial increases in prospect cannot but be a cause of serious concern.There is already much complaint from local authorities at the size of the burdenresting on the ratepayer, and the share of the taxpayer is much heavier. The main factors causing increased expenditure are the growth in the school population dueto the expansion in the post-war birthrate, the transfer of population to new townsand new housing estates, increased technical education and the rise in the number and salaries of teachers. Some of the factors cannot be influenced; to counteractothers will involve very difficult decisions. We have discussed with the minister the following possibilities :  (a) Transfer of an increased proportion of the cost of education to the ratesThis would evoke strong local opposition and would in any case notbe possible before the new Valuation Bill, at least two years hence.(b) Lowering the school-leaving ageThis would provoke serious political opposition and would causedifficulty in connection with the absorption of teachers renderedsupernumerary.(c) Raising the minimum school-starting age to 6To make it illegal to send children to school before the age of 6 wouldrequire legislation and would only be carried through at great politicalcost.(d) Charging feesThis would be a serious reversal of existing policy and might wellpenalise the brighter children on whom the country&apos;s future depends.(e) Administrative EconomiesThe Minister is keeping up pressure on local authorities but no greatsaving can be secured by this means. Salary and wage increases are outside the Minister^ control.The Minister^ view is that any economies to be obtained by the abovemeasures would not be worth the opposition which they would provoke. None theless it seems impossible to exclude such a great and growing block of Governmentand Local Government expenditure from economy measures. In education, as inother fields, it does not seem unreasonable to hope that worthwhile results would flow from the introduction of a spirit of &quot; how much can we save &quot; instead of&quot;what more can we spend;&quot;There is one cause of the rise in educational expenditure to which we havedevoted particular attention, namely, the transfer of population to new towns andnew housing estates. This is, of course, one.aspect of the general question of housing policy and will no doubt be fully considered by the special ministerial committee. We therefore content ourselves with drawing attention to it andremarking that any modification of present housing policy in this respect would yield appreciable savings in educational expenditure. For example, the Ministerof Education has estimated that if from 1956 onwards the whole housing effortwere devoted to rehabilitation and redevelopment of existing areas instead of continuing on the present pattern, there might be a saving in educational expendi-ture of  4-5 millions a year to 1960. This saving would, of course, primarilyshow itself in the Budget &quot; below the line,&quot; but there would also be a saving onExchequer grants &quot; above the line.&quot;13. Housing (Grants from Exchequer)   million1953-54 Provision ...1955-56 Forecast  ...7081On this we must await the outcome of the separate Ministerial review of housing Policy.
14. National Insurance1953-54 Provision1955-56 Forecast   ...1963-64 Long-range forecast(These figures include both the Exchequer contribution to National insurance funds and other expenditure of the Ministry of National Insurance, -includingfamily allowances. The 1955-56 figure makes no provision for the ,deficit ofi 60 millions in that year\jn the National Insurance Fund, though this is^aprdbablS1Exchequer liability.)Presumably this prospect will be taken into consideration by the independent committee of Enquiry into the provision for old age. The main hope of improving the situation would seem to be in the direction of raising the age of retirement.15. National Assistance   million1953-54 Provision......      .........      ... 1281955-56 Forecast.................. 1371963-64 Long-range forecast     ..;      ...      ...... 169The rise is due to expected increases in the number of applicants. There areonly three ways of effecting large and immediate reductions in the cost of assistance.One is to decrease the scale rates. The second is to restore the household means test. The third is to change the temper of administration to such an extent that assistance comes to be regarded by decent people (who now make up the over-whelming majority of the recipients) as something to which resort is only had inthe last extremities, like poor law relief in the old days. The Minister of national insurance does not think that any of these alternatives would be politicallyacceptable.16. We have not included costs Of administration among the fields in whichmajor economies can be looked for. We attach the utmost importance to thereduction of such costs and would ask that all. Ministers Should keep this objectiveconstantly in mind in collaboration with the Treasury. But it would be a mistake to rely on any large savings by this means unless the services on which administra-tive costs arise are themselves abandoned or curtailed. The reductions in staffachieved, or about to be achieved, by the Ministers of Food and Agriculture asa result of the abolition of various controls indicate that the opportunities of suchsavings are not neglected. The overall reduction of some 22,000 in the size ofthe Civil Service since 1st January, 1952, shows that we have made a good start, but no relaxation of effort in this direction can be countenanced.17.  In summary, our conclusions and recommendations are as follow. (i) The prospective growth of Government expenditure on the basis ofexisting policies, both in the short-term and in the long-term, is suchas to cause the gravest concern and to compel a radical reconsideration of these policies.(ii) In view of the high proportion of our expenditure which is devoted to defence, it is clear that we must look to this field for a major contribu-tion to economy.(iii) We should work out the best means of achieving in 1954-55 a considerable reduction in the provision for food subsidies.(iv) We must be ready to act vigorously on the report of the Committee ofEnquiry into the National Health Service when it is available.(v) We should ourselves continue to seek means of reducing the cost ofeducation.(vi) The Ministerial Committee on Housing Policy should be asked to lookearnestly for possibilities of reducing expenditure on housing.(vii) The possibility of reducing the prospective burden on the Exchequer inconnection with National Insurance must await the outcome of theenquiry into provision for old age.(viii) There are economies which might be made in the provision for national assistance, but there are political difficulties in this field,(ix) The achievement of maximum savings on the costs of administration mustbe a constant concern of all Ministers, in collaboration with theChancellor of the Exchequer.44327 B 3  million183183386
