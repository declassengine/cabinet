Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1953SECRET . Copy No.C. (53) 1679th June, 1953CABINETCOLONIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELFAREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, which provide up to  140 millions for colonial development over 10 years, expire on 31st March, 1956. Although thelegislation still has 3 years to run, we must now start planning for the future.Otherwise continuity will be lost and hurried decisions will have to be taken oninsufficient information. I therefore propose, with the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer, to send a despatch to Colonial Governments now onthe lines of paragraph 3 below. It should thus be possible to assemble by thebeginning of next year the material on which we can decide what further fundswe should ask Parliament to provide.2. A new Act will, of course, be needed. I should hope to be able to introduceit before the 1954 summer recess and to bring it into force on 1st April, 1955, to run until 31st March, 1960. I have chosen 5 years because experience has shownthat 10 years is too long for realistic planning in this field. The purpose of theoverlap of one year with the present Acts is to ensure continuity.3. My despatch to Colonial Governments will not propose any figure for future assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Instead, it will ask theGovernments to draw up financial statements showing their total planned (or expected) expenditure on development for the five-year period and indicating howfar they expect to be able to meet that expenditure from their own resources. Ishall emphasise the magnitude of the burdens which the United Kingdom is carrying and therefore the need for the Colonies to make the maximum effort tomeet their development requirements from their own resources. I shall underlinethe importance of furthering the policy agreed upon at the commonwealth economic Conference and draw attention to factors other than financial, such astransport and labour, which affect the speed of development. Finally, I shall make. it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government is not now entering into any commitment to provide further funds of a specified amount, either by Treasury grants or loans -or through access to the London Loan market, and that when the statements havebeen examined here it may be beyond our power to provide out of our resourcesthe sums of money which the Colonies say they need.4. There is another, but related matter which is already causing difficulty tosome Colonial&quot; Governments. Under the terms of the present Acts, the money(except for &quot;research&quot; schemes) stops on 31st March, .1956. My colleagues will agree that this could seriously distort planned development, for example, by encouraging Colonial Governments, for fear of losing their allocations, to crowdexpenditure into the next three years at all:costs. It would be premature tointroduce new legislation, but I wish to assure Colonial Governments that unspentmoney from the present Acts may be carried forward beyond 1956. I should alsolike to be free, where this is absolutely necessary, to allow plans to proceed on theassumption that further funds will be provided by the United Kingdom in due course. This power of advance authorisation involving further funds will belimited to a maximum of  7 millions and will only be exercised with the concurrence of the Treasury.   None of this would be spent before 1956.44333
5. I ask, therefore, that I should be authorised to make an early statement to Parliament in the form of the attached draft, with which the Chancellor of theExchequer has already concurred. I would take the opportunity at the same timeof explaining to Parliament the arrangements already made for providing specialfunds up to  3 millions for rice investigations in the Colonies.6. In all future consideration of this question I will ensure, in consultationwith the Chancellor, that the greatest possible use is made by the Colonies oftheir largely increased sterling balances, so far as the nature and purposes of thosebalances permit. This subject is now being jointly studied by the Treasury and theColonial Office.O. L.Colonial Office, SWA,9th June, 1953.Draft Parliamentary Question and Answer(for written Answer)question to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he can yet make a state-fnent about the future of Colonial development and welfare assistance after thetermination of the present Colonial Development and Welfare Acts on 31stMarch, 1956.AnswerYes, Sir. I am asking Colonial Governments and other authorities concerned to provide me with material On which Her Majesty&apos;s Government can decide to approach Parliament for further funds for Colonial development. I hope it willbe possible to introduce the necessary legislation during the first half of next year.Meanwhile I am telling Colonial Governments that they may proceed on theassumption that the period in which the  140 millions provided under the colonial development and Welfare Acts of 1945 and 1950 may be spent will be extended by legislation beyond the 31st March, 1956.I am also telling them that, where necessary for essential development, theymay enter into commitments extending beyond 1956 and over and above the  140millions already provided, on the understanding that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill in due course ask Parliament to vote the necessary monies. Such advancecommitments will be limited to a total of  7 millions, and will not be made withoutthe concurrence of the Treasury.There is a further matter of which I should inform the House. In view of theserious world rice shortage, we have thought is necessary to make funds availableto a maximum of  3 millions for experiments on the production of rice in theColonies. Expenditure on such schemes is proper to the existing Colonial Develop-ment and Welfare Acts, but we do not wish it to displace desirable developments in other directions. These special rice schemes may therefore in due course involveallocations, and ultimately expenditure, in excess Of the existing statutory limit of  140 millions. The legislation to which I have referred will also, if necessary,provide cover for expenditure up to  3 millions which may be incurred under these arrangements.I should make it clear that there is no question of authorising in advance ofthe new legislation, actual expenditure in excess of the existing statutory limits.But the House should be aware that Colonial Governments may in the meantimebe entering into commitments, to the extent which I have indicated, ort the under-standing that the necessary funds to meet these commitments will be provided by her Majesty&apos;s Government under the new legislation. I can see no other way of ensuring that the continuity of Colonial development is not interrupted, and i feel confident that I have the full support of the House in the action I am now taking.
