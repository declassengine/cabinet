Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1953Copy No.     66CABINETTHE  sudan memorandum by the Minister of state in (C. (53) 168), I described my conversations with Sir Sayed Abdel Rahman elMahdi during his visit to this country for the Coronation.2. Since the Mahdi&apos;s return to Khartoum, the Umma Party have discussedtheir next moves amongst themselves, and with Mr. Luce, the Head of the Governor -GeneraFs Office. They have shown signs of weakening in their determination tobreak with the Egyptians. Neguib has withdrawn his tactless letter of 23rd Mayand has promised that any misunderstandings can be smoothed out; the Umma areconsequently inclined to give the Egyptians another chance to mend their ways.They have said, however, that their Executive has decided that if the Egyptianseither refuse to give the assurances demanded by them or, having given such assur-ances, fail to carry them out fully within about a month, then the Umma Party willstate publicly that the Egyptians have broken their Agreement, will launch an all-out press and propaganda attack against Egypt and the pro-Egyptian party, andwill co-operate openly with us. They have also said that they will discuss withthe Socialist Republican Party working arrangements for constituencies where thesetwo pro-independence parties are in conflict.3. Our latest information is that Neguib has now told Abdulla Khalil,Secretary-General of the Umma Party, that he would favour real independence forthe Sudan, with treaty relations to safeguard the mutual interests of the twocountries but that he dare not say so publicly. We also learn that his Minister forSudan Affairs Major Salem -has given assurances that support of the NationalUnionist Party will cease. The Umma are accordingly waiting about three weeks tosee what happens; but in the meantime Salem is paying a visit to the Sudan withthe alleged object of bringing the Mahdi and his rival, Sayed Ali, closer together.4. We may not in fact get any explicit denunciation by the Umma Party oftheir Agreement with the Egyptians, but I think they might in certain circumstancesgo so far in non-co-operation with the Egyptians and in conducting an all-outelectoral campaign against the pro-Egyptian party that we could support them without too much risk of their letting us down again. If, on the other hand, theysucceed in persuading the Egyptians to call off their improper activities, the situa-tion would be quite different; we might still be able to co-operate with them, if wewere satisfied that they had really changed the Egyptian attitude.5. The Governor-General returned to Khartoum on 5th July and will bereporting on the present situation.6. With regard to the elections, the only important development is that theEgyptian and. pro-Egyptian Sudanese members of the Electoral Commission havestaged a walk-out on an issue concerned with the right of tribal leaders to take part in politics. It was an issue on which the Indian Chairman, the United Statesmember and the Umma Party member of the Commission were at first almost wholly in sympathy with the pro-Egyptian point of view. We have our memberof the Commission, Mr. Penney, to thank for the fact that the two advocates of extreme courses were thus in the end isolated. The Commission adjourned in mid-June until mid-August, and it seems probable that the Egyptian member, andpossibly the pro-Egyptian Sudanese, will return when the Commission reassembles.In any case, preparations for the elections (to be held in October and November)are complete.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7th July, 1953.secret. (53) 1977th July, 195344472
