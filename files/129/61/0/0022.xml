GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE:NO-NEW-PREFERENCE RULEMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will recollect that, before the Commonwealth EconomicConference, we agreed to seek Commonwealth support for the abolition or modification of the rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) which prohibits Commonwealth countries from increasing margins of preference in their trade with one another.    In the event the commonwealth prime Ministers were loath to pursue this line, as they considered that itmight prejudice the Collective Approach upon which we were all engaged.Agreement was, however, reached that we should seek one particular and important modification, namely a right, in proper cases, to increase our owndomestic tariff for protective purposes without at the same time imposing a duty upon the entry of Commonwealth goods which hitherto have been duty free.2.        My colleagues are, I think, already well aware of the nature of this problem.    The G.A. T.T. prohibits any increase in preference margins.    Thelegislation which gave effect to the Ottawa Agreements prohibits us fromimposing duties on a wide range of Commonwealth goods.    The combination of these two factors effectively prevents us over a wide range of goods andcommodities from increasing our own tariff, even after full and detailedenquiry has shown it to be clearly necessary to do so.3.       Any attempt to cut our way out of this dilemma by imposing duties on commonwealth goods would run counter to our traditional open-door policy for Commonwealth trade.    In most cases it would require legislation amending the Ottawa Agreements Act so as to empower us to impose such duties.    such legislation would clearly be very controversial, and it is doubtful whether itwould command the support of the majority of any Party in the present Houseof Commons.    Moreover, the process of negotiating agreement with theCommonwealth Governments to the imposition of duties on goods of interest totheir export trade would quickly lead to a severe strain on the whole existingstructure of Imperial Preference.4.        This group of problems has been brought to a head by the applicationof the National Farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) in the United Kingdom for certain changes in the horticultural tariff.    After a very full enquiry a decision wasreached and approved by this Government last October, that a substantial part of the N. F. U.&apos;s case for certain increases in the protective duties onhorticultural products was well founded and should be conceded,5.        The factors which I have described above inhibit us from hmplementingour decisions in this matter.    We are not able in the circumstances to increasethese horticultural tariffs, and we have had to tell the N. F. U. that this is so,and why.    Since they were told of this last November the N. F. U. have behavedCOPY NO. 7-2-secret,(53) 17213TH JUNE, 1953CABINET
with, very great restraint.    They have sought, with success, to restrain their members from pressing us in public to implement our decision.    The Ministerof Agriculture and I have so far persuaded the N. F. U. that our chance of getting the necessary amendment to the rules of the G. A. T. T. would be bestserved by a continuation of this restraint for the time being.    Recent discussions with the N. F. U. suggest that it is unlikely that this situation can be held beyondthe end of this year.6.        Our policy in these matters has long been that we should use tariffsrather than quotas as the method of protection for horticulture, as for otherindustries.    Such a policy is indeed the only one consistent with our international obligations.    We have reiterated this theme in many public speeches and it iswell known to be our view throughout industry.    It is also integral to our wholeconception of the Collective Approach.7.        In these circumstances it is quite clear that, at the forthcoming sessionof the G. A. T. T. , we must seek to get the freedom that we need (in accordancewith the decision of the Commonwealth Economic Conference) in order to implement our stated general policy, as well as for the immediate purpose offulfilling our decision on the horticultural tariff, v/hich is one aspect of the wider issue.8.        I must warn my colleagues that in seeking to do this we shall run intoconsiderable difficulties and dangers.    It is important that we should face thesedangers now and decide collectively the best way in which we can surmount them.9.        When Ministers went to Washington in February, the Chancellor took the opportunity to explain the political difficulties of our present position to united States Ministers, who, while not committing themselves in any way,suggested that the problem should first be examined by officials of both Govern&quot;ments.    A number of discussions have since taken place between officials ata high level, and such indications as we have of the attitude likely to be takenby the United States Government raise issues of considerable political and commercial importance.10.      So far as we can judge the position from discussions at official level itseems unlikely that American officials, although they have in general shown themselves sympathetic to our difficulties, will feel able to recommend that theUnited States should acquiesce in an unqualified general waiver under theG. A. T. T. , designed to give us the full freedom which we seek.    They arecertain to seek to attach to any such waiver at any rate some formula designedto exclude from its scope some at least of the goods in which both they and theCommonwealth have a substantial interest.    Their reasons for this attitudeare partly the difficulty of justifying to Congress their agreement in principle to increased preferences against United States trade, and partly a real fear that in such cases there might be a substantial diversion of trade; they would obviously face severe political difficulties if our duty, say, on American appleswere raised while the Canadian product was left free.11.       On the other hand we on our side are confronted with equally severepolitical difficulties at home.    This is ah issue which could easily arouse thepassionate advocacy both of those who support the Imperial tradition and thosewho support the agricultural interest.    A combination of these schools of thought within the Conservative Party is likely in the long run to provedecisive.
12.       At first sight there would appear to be three courses - all extremelyunpalatable - open to us:-(a) We could press for full freedom to increase ourprotective tariff without imposing corresponding increases on Commonwealth goods.    We should all like this.    But I see no prospect of achievingit.    American opposition would be certain;  wewould be unlikely to get European support;  and,with America upon the other side, we could not guarantee, despite the last Commonwealth EconomicConference, that even the Commonwealth would beunited on the subject.To pursue this course, to fail, and then to plead thefailure as the reason for our inability to implementour own decisions about our tariffs would clearlylead us into great and growing difficulties.    It seemsto me therefore that it would only make sense to pursue this line if in the last resort we were preparedto assume the freedom that we want, if necessaryoutside the G. A. T. T.    But the G. A, T. T. , for allthat is said against it, has important advantages forour export trade.    A decision to denounce it - or acourse which is likely to lead rapidly to such adecision - should not be lightly taken-.    It would clearly be hard to reconcile with our declared aim off moving towards freer trade and payments.(b) We could seek to re-negotiate the Ottawa Agreements andto promote the necessary legislation to impose tariffs on Colonial and Commonwealth goods and so to conform,to the No-New-Preference Rule.    Even if we thought this was a good thing to do, and I personally do not,my judgment is that it would not command the supportof any Party in the House of Commons.(c) We could try to go on as we are, continuing to use quotasto limit imports so  long as balance of payments difficulties persist, and refusing to implementdecisions to vary the horticultural and other tariffs on the ground that we were inhibited by a cornbina&quot;tion of the G.A.T.T. and Ottawa from doing so.The Minister of Agriculture can, no doubt, describewith more fervour even than I the kind of receptionthat such an announcement of policy would receive.In any event, the case goes far wider than the horticultural tariff and I do not judge that a greatindustrial nation such as ours could remain for longin a situation in which a large part of its tariff was virtually frozen.13.       It is against this background that I have been examining what is best to be done.    I have come to the conclusion that we should make one last effort to persuade the Americans to accept a general waiver and, if we fail, negotiate with them for a qualified waiver.    In the effort to secure a general waiver weshould see whether we could ease the Americans&apos; presentational difficulty bydrafting such a waiver in terms which excluded those duties which at any
particular moment were bound at a given rate.    If we at any time wished tobring such goods within the terms of the waiver we should first have to take appropriate steps to free the tariff rate from the binding.    By drafting the waiver in this way, we would help the Americans to make it clear to congress and industry in the United States that the waiver left unaffected the variousand important commitments which we have negotiated to bind against increasedparticular duties on specific goods.14.       I doubt, however, whether the Americans will regard this as goingfar enough to meet their difficulties, if only because it would involve accepting the risk of our increasing some of our ubbound duties where the consequent increase of preference would be likely to divert trade to Commonwealth suppliersIn that case the qualification I should offer would be to attach to the waiver a clause providing that, if in any case an incidental increase of preference result-ing from action taken under the waiver were to lead to a substantial diversion of trade, the foreign country affected should be entitled to seek authority inthe G.A.T.T. to suspend equivalent concessions or obligations towards us.15 .      A carefully drafted waiver with this important qualification should goa long way to meet the United States difficulties and we should do our best toget a settlement on this basis.    In case, however, the Americans insist thatthe waiver must exclude the goods that are most difficult for them in relationto preferences, I should be ready to offer one further concession - but onlyin the last resort and on the understanding that it would clinch an agreement -and this would be to exclude from the waiver the goods which were chargedwith duty under the Ottawa Agreements Act.    I attach a list of these goods.These are goods on which the duties were primarily designed by statute togive preference for Commonwealth imports as distinct from protection for domestic production;  and, while their exclusion from the general waiver wouldinvolve obvious political difficulties for us, it is not unreasonable that anyquestion of increasing the preferences on these goods should stand over andbe subject to individual waivers.16.      There are clearly substantial difficulties about the proposal in thepreceding paragraph.    I would expect to come under considerable politicalattack from Conservative as well as Socialist quarters.    In omitting the Ottawaschedule list from the waiver, we should be leaving ourselves in the G.A. T.T./Ottawa dilemma in a number of important cases, notably apples and pears,which are at present the subject of a tariff application.     On the other hand,not only apples and pears, but most, if not all, of the items in the Ottawaschedule which are of material interest to United Kingdom producers are&quot;bound&quot;.    That is to say, we have, in return for important concessions forour export trade, undertaken not to increase the tariff on them;  an obligationwhich we could contract out of only at a considerable price in any circumstances.If therefore we should want at any time to increase the duties and preferenceson these goods we should inevitably be involved in a difficult negotiation;and the task of securing individual waivers from the No-New-Preference rule would be an extra hurdle and not the only one.17.      It may well be, of course, that we shall fail to secure agreement foreven such a limited waiver.    If that happens, we shall be in a very serious position in which the whole question of our membership of the G. A. T. T, issure to be challenged inside and outside the Conservative Party.    I do notconsider that at this stage we need to decide what we should then do, but Ido consider that our international standing in the matter would have been greatly strengthened if we could at that moment show that we had gone to all reasonable lengths to ensure international agreement to the course we
desired, and that in the process we had been compelled to offer concessions which were politically extremely difficult for us.    It is for these reasons thatI commend the course set out above.18. I accordingly ask my colleagues to approve the following conclusions and recommendations:^(a) We should place the question of a waiver of the No-New-Preference Rule on the agenda of the next G.A.T.T.Session in September.(b) We should forthwith get in touch again with the americans in order to try to secure their support at ministerial level for a waiver, subject, if necessary, to the qualification described in paragraph 14.(c) We should., in the last resort and provided this would clinchagreement with the Americans, offer to exclude the ottawa duties from the waiver (paragraph 15).(d) In the light of the discussions with the Americans, we should seek to mobilize support from the Commonwealth andfrom Europe before the next Session of the G*A.T.T.takes place.(e) I should be authorised to attend the next Session of theG.A.T.T. myself in order to negotiate a settlementwithin the limits of (b) and (c) above.P T. -.Board of Trade, S.W.1.13TH JUNE, 1953.
