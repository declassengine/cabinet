STATEMENT ON TELEVISION development to BE MADE BY THE POSTMASTER general  am glad to inform the House that the Government are now in aposition to agree that the B. B. C. should proceed at once with certain projectsthat will make television available to another 6-7 million people.    They can also now make a start with Very High Frequency sound services to helpimprove reception in areas where it is not now satisfactory.New television stations will be set up at Aberdeen, Belfast, the isle of Wight, Plymouth and Pontop Pike;  the London station will be removedto the Crystal Palace;  and stations will be erected to serve the channel islands and the Isle of Man.    With this programme of development B. B. C.television will be available to some 90 per cent of the population within aperiod of eighteen months.In their White Paper on Broadcasting issued in May, 1952, (Cmd. 8550)the Government stated, in paragraph 7, that they had &quot;come to the conclusionthat in the expanding field of television provision should be made to permitsome element of competition.....&quot;.    Anxieties have been expressed since that date about the implications of a new system of competitive television.There is, however, a real danger that the public mind is being influencedwithout any balanced or detailed knowledge of what sort of system might beset up.    The Government therefore propose to publish in the autumn a furtherWhite Paper defining the field in which competitive television could beSECRETC.(53) 18Z COPY NO. ^ *026TH JUNE, 1953CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the Postmaster general as requested by the Cabinet on 24th June (C. C. (53) 36th Conclusions,Minute 5) I have had discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theLord Privy Seal and the Minister of Housing, and now circulate our final draftof a statement to be made in Parliament.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.26TH JUNE, 1953.
permitted to operate.    The White Paper will enable this House and the countryto exercise a proper judgment in good time before a decision is taken to issue the necessary licences, the terms and conditions of which, as has been stated,would first be submitted to the approval of Parliament.In considering this whole question it is necessary to emphasise whatseems often to be forgotten - that the B.B. C. will in any case remain intactand its scope will in fact be extended.    Its national and international standingwill be unaffected, and its revenue and present basis of work will remainsecure.The House will be interested to know, without going into details whichwould be more appropriate to the White Paper, of some of the broad principlesunder which competitive television might operate:-1.    The number of stations under any one ownership or control would be limited.2.    It is not likely that a large number of stations would be licensed in the first instance, and they would be of low power and limited range.3.    A Controlling Body would be set up to advise the Post-master General on the issue of licences and would see thatprogrammes conformed to the standards to be laid down.    Itwould, for example, have power to call for a script in advance of presentation, to warn a station which offended against the letter orspirit of those standards and to make recommendations to the Post-master General that the licence of any particular station should be suspended or withdrawn.4.    The owner and operator of a station, whose licence wouldbe at stake, and not the provider of programmes or the sponsor,would be the person responsible for what was broadcast.5.    Among other things which might be specified in the licenceor by the Controlling Body would be the maximum number of hoursthe station should operate, any restrictions on the advertising ofcertain products, the percentage of time and the place to be allotted to advertising matter in any programme, and the proportion, if any,of imported programme material to be permitted.
