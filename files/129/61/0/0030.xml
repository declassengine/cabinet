COPY NO.    LiCABINETTELEVISION policy memorandum by the Postmaster-general it may be helpful to my colleagues to see before tomorrow&apos;s cabinet meeting the answers to the Minister of Housing&apos;s questions in paragraph of C.(53) 178.(i) The &quot;converters&quot; or adaptors would be designed and ready to go into production in twelve months, i. e. , June or July, 1954, provided only one further station in a given area was envisaged.   If two or more stations wereenvisaged, the problem might be a little more complicated and this would cause delay.(ii) Half a million adaptors might be available by the end of 1954.(iii) New sets able to be switched on to an alternative programme(easier in some ways to produce than adaptors for existing sets) should be onsale in moderate numbers by next June or July,   The new sets would automatically be available for more than one station.(iv) Taking these facts into account there should not be much riskin advancing our date for allowing competitive television on the air to 1st October, 1954.   Any earlier date would open us to the risk of puttingstations on the air with hardly anybody able to look in.(v) The cost of an adaptor plus a new or modified aerial would be between  8 and  15.   The difference is accounted for by varying distancesfrom the transmitting station.   The cost might be more for two or morestations.   The increased cost for new sets would be about  3 to  5.(vi) In the short term the export market might be slightly affected,but on a longer view a firmer basis would be provided for exports.   We see no reason why defence provision should be affected.   Before the meeting I willconfirm this point with the Minister of Supply.2.       The Chairman of the Radio Industry Council, who is my source ofinformation, stressed that his industry consists of 46 highly individualist firms;what I have said represents his views of the capacity of the industry as a whole,and he cannot, of course, speak for every individual firm.   My own engineers,however, confirm his views.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.23rd June, 1953.secret. (53) 16023rd JUNE, 1953.
