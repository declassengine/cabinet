(53) 16020th May, 1953CABINETEXPENSE ALLOWANCES FOR UNPAID PUBLIC service note by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate by direction of the Prime Minister a letter which he has receivedfrom Sir Vincent Tewson, the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress,and a draft reply which has been prepared by the Departments concerned. ThePrime Minister wishes his colleagues to consider in particular the second paragraphof the draft reply.I also attach an earlier letter to the Prime Minister from Sir Vincent Tewsonand the Prime Minister^ reply.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th May, 1953.Draft ReplyThank you for your further letter of 28th April about expense allowances for unpaid public service. I am glad that the Government^ suggestions give general satisfaction to your Council.You suggested that the General Council might be consulted on the final drafts of any Regulations. This would, I am afraid, be a departure from normal practice.Where Regulations of this kind affect directly and wholly some particular interest,they are often shown in draft to the appropriate body. But I am sure that theGeneral Council will understand that Ministers would soon be in great difficultyif they extended this practice to Regulations of more general concern which arenow submitted to the judgment of Parliament only.You ask that Jurors&apos; compensation for loss of earnings should in future be regulated by statutory instrument. I agree that when it is possible to legislateabout them power should be taken to regulate them in this way.You asked the Government to bear in mind the need for hurrying mattersalong as fast as possible. We will, of course, do our best and I am grateful for your understanding of the difficulties involved.Sir Vincent Tewson, C.B.E., M.C.44244b
Letter dated 28th April from Sir Vincent Tewson to the Prime MinisterTrades Union Congress,Transport House,Smith Square, S.W.1,VT/VB/RC/754 128th April, 1953.Rt. Hon Sir Winston Churchill, K.G., O.M., C.H., M.P.,10, Downing Street,London, S.W. 1.Dear Sir Winston,Expense Allowances for Unpaid Public service am writing with further reference to my letter of March 24 about the Govern-menfs proposals in the above matter.These have now been considered by the General Council and, whilst they would welcome the opportunity of passing an opinion on the final draft of any regulations, they wish to express their general satisfaction with the Government^suggestions.At the moment I would only re-emphasise that, for the reasons already explained to the Home Secretary in our letters of November 29, 1951, and april 24, 1952, the General Council have been unable to agree with the discrimina-tion between witnesses and jurors as against other persons. We further suggestthat, whatever scales of subsistence allowances are laid down for witnesses andjurors, the jurors&apos; scale of compensation for loss of earnings should in future bedetermined by Statutory Instrument (as the Government propose for other loss of earnings allowances).Finally the General Council trust that the Government will bear in mind thetime which has elapsed since the cost of living made the present scales inequitableand since the matter was first raised by us with the various Ministers concerned.We realise the need for consultations with local authority associations and thelegislative difficulties, but would urge that the matter be expedited as much aspossible.Yours sincerely,(Signed) -     VINCENT TEWSON,General Secretary.Letter dated 19th March from the Prime Minister to Sir Vincent Tewson10, Downing Street,Whitehall, S.W. 1,My dear Tewson, 19th March, 1953.You wrote to me on 1st January about expense allowances for unpaid publicservice. I have now had the question thoroughly examined by all the manyDepartments concerned.I agree with your general proposition that there ought to be greater uniformity.But, as you know, though all the rates are regulated either by statute or by theGovernment, some are a charge on local funds and not on the Exchequer, and on them it is necessary to consider the views of the Local Authorities. In some cases,too, a change is not possible without legislation.For these and other reasons I cannot undertake that the Government will immediately introduce uniform rates as you propose, but I think we can go aconsiderable way. The enclosed memorandum shows the action Which theGovernment intend to take, and I think you will find it meets a good many of yourpoints.Yours sincerely,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Sir Vincent Tewson, C.B.E., M.C.

Sir Vincent Tewson proposes 305. a day for all classes.3. The Government agree that there is no good reason for differentiating, andthat 305. a day is reasonable.4.   Action as follows:  Members of Royal Commissions, &amp;c. A change can be made at once.Members of Local Authorities. Legislation is necessary. It should takethe form of allowing new rates to be fixed from time to time by regulation. The Government are seeking to get the amendmentincluded in a Private Member&apos;s Bill now before Parliament.National Health Service. Regulations are necessary. They will be made when the rate of members of Local Authorities is altered.Jurors. Legislation is necessary. There is no immediate opportunity,but the Home Secretary will do all he can to find one soon.Witnesses. Regulations are necessary. They will be made when the ratefor Jurors is altered.5. Before new rates are fixed for Local Authority members, Witnesses andJurors, they will be discussed with the Local Authority Associations.B. Subsistence Allowances6.

Sir Vincent Tewson proposes that the rates for members of Royal Corn-missions, &amp;c, should apply throughout, except that the Local Authorities should keep their special rate for &quot; over 12 hours.&quot;8. There is no reason, from the Governments point of view, why these rates should not apply to members of Local Authorities. But their present rates are insome respects more favourable. They would not welcome reductions at these points, and they are pressing for- increases. The Government consider that theyshould not have the best of both worlds, but would not object to the applicationto Local Authority members of the rates payable to members of Royal Commis-sions, &amp;c, as a whole.9. Witnesses and Jurors are in a different position. They are serving under an obligation of citizenship, whereas the other classes are rendering unpaid publicservice without any: obligation to do. so. For this reason Witnesses and Jurorshave always been treated differently.  They get third-class, not first-class, travel,44244 b 2
Letter dated 1st January from Sir Vincent Tewson to the Prime MinisterTrades Union Congress,VT/VB/RC/396 Transport House, S.W.L,1st January, 1953.Rt. Hon. W. L. S. Churchill, O.M., C.H., D.L., M.P.,Prime Minister,10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.Dear Mr. Churchill, .Expense Allowances for Unpaid Public service the General Council have recently considered certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with the expense allowances made to persons undertakingvarious forms of unpaid public service. This is a matter in which several Govern-ment Departments are concerned, and because we have been unable to get a satis-factory solution from individual Ministers I am writing to bring it to your attention.The principal cause for complaint on the part of our affiliated unions is thatthe scales of payment for some of the allowances are inadequate at the present levelof living costs. An aggravating ground of complaint is that there are manydiscrepancies between the scales paid for different forms of public service even where these are admitted to be analogous; it is our view that this range of allowances should be made uniform in order to give equitable treatment.The allowances in question are those which apply to the following persons:unpaid members of Government Committees and Royal Commissions, andwitnesses called before such Committees and Commissions; members of localauthorities; members of Health Service Committees; witnesses in criminal cases;jurors. They are intended to cover subsistence when engaged upon these forms ofservice and to compensate for loss of earnings which may be incurred. I append alist setting out these various allowances, and showing the discrepancies which exist.We suggest that in order to remove these discrepancies the scale for Govern-ment Committees (the Treasury scale) should be taken as the standard and otherscales be brought into line with it. The Treasury scale for compensation for lossof earnings has itself not been raised since September 1948, but is still higherthan the other scales. We are aware that this compensation is not intended torecompense in full any actual loss of earnings, beyond a maximum of 25,?. Od. per day, but only to avoid any undue hardship; however, although 255. Od. may havebeen satisfactory in this respect in 1948, the cost of living has risen since thenby nearly 30 per cent., and this would, we feel, justify an increase even in theTreasury scale up to 30^. Od. per day.The other scales have a maximum loss of earnings allowance of 20?. Od.This figure causes dissatisfaction at the present level of prices and has not been raised since any of the scales were introduced in 1948 or 1949. We thereforeurge most strongly that these scales should be brought up to the level of theTreasury scale.As regards subsistence allowances, the Treasury scale has recently increased and the Health Service scale has also been raised in line with this increase. Thereare, however, a number of discrepancies in the remaining scales and the overnightand their subsistance allowances are likewise fixed on a less generous scale. TheGovernment consider that the distinction should be maintained, but not to theextent of causing financial hardship to Witnesses and Jurors. There may well be acase for saying that their present rates are too low.10.   Action as follows:  Members of Local Authorities. The responsible Ministers will resume negotiations with the Associations and will, if necessary, makeamending regulations.Witnesses and Jurors. The Home Secretary will initiate discussions withthe Local Authority Associations with a view to fixing a fair rate inthe light of present costs, and, if necessary, will make amendingregulations.
allowance for witnesses and jurors in particular is much below the level of similarallowances under other scales. We suggest that for simplicity and equity all thesescales should be brought into line with the Treasury scale, except that additionallythe 15s. Od. allowance to members of local authorities should be retained to meetthe special needs of such members.We have at various times taken up the question of these allowances individuallywith the Government Departments concerned; indeed the present level of the com-pensation for loss of earnings under the Treasury scale was fixed in 1948 afterrepresentations from the General Council. However, we have since met with difficulties in replies from Ministers, partly due to the fact that certain allowancesneed legislation for their amendment. This is an additional reason why we nowfeel obliged to approach you on the whole question.We were informed by the Labour Government and again by the presentMinister of Health that it would be anomalous to raise the loss of earnings allowance for Health Service Committees without raising that for local authority members;this latter step needs an amendment to the Local Government Act, 1948, althoughthe Health Service allowances can be varied by Order. It was said by the ministers concerned that there was no prospect of introducing new legislation on this subject.A similar difficulty arises with jurors&apos; loss of earnings allowances under theJuries Act, 1949, which, according to the present Home Secretary, could not in thismatter be considered in isolation from the scale laid down in the Local government act, 1948.It is clear that there is little logic or equity in the present tangle of allowances,and that there will be increasing dissatisfaction among many who perform these various unpaid public services unless the necessary legislative and administrative action can be taken. I am sure you will agree that it is not in the public interest that such dissatisfaction should exist. The General Council very much hope, there-fore, that you will agree to have the whole tangle unravelled on the lines they suggest.Yours sincerely,(Signed)        VINCENT TEWSON,General Secretary.EnclosureScales of Allowances for Unpaid Public ServiceScale Subsistence Allowance	Less than	Over	Over	Over	Over	Per	4 hours	4 hours	5 hours	8 hours	12 hours	night	s.  d.	s. d.	s. d.	s. d.	s.  d.	s.   d.Treasury    ......
