secret.(53) 181 . COPY NO. 0 /25TH JUNE, 1953CABINETUNITED KINGDOM DEBTS TO THE UNITED STATESAND CANADAMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerLast December I undertook to circulate to the Cabinet my proposals fora formal approach to the United States Administration in the matter of our debtsto the United States (C. C. (52) 104th Conclusions, Minute 2).    I subsequently under-took to put forward, in the light of the Washington discussions, recommendations about the precise timing and nature of the proposals which we should make inregard to our debts to the United States and, if appropriate, in regard to ourindebtedness to Canada (GEN. 424-/lst Meeting).2.        The upshot of the discussions which I had in Washington with theSecretary of the United States Treasury is that we have sown the seeds of theidea of an all-round settlement of war and war-consequential debts in mr. Humphrey&apos;s mind but, while he agreed there was a case for examining this,we cannot tell whether and when they will bear any fruit. . In these circumstances we ought now to consider making full use of the waiver clauses which apply to payment of interest on certain of our United States and Canadian loans.3.        The amounts involved in an application of the waiver clauses in theUnited States and Canadian loan agreements are substantial in relation to thebalance of payments, and by no means negligible in relation to the budget.The figures for the year 1953 are approximately as follows:-U.S.fi MillionInterest element Principal payable Totalsubject to waiver in any event instalment1. 2. 3. 4.U.S. Line of credit and LendLease Settlement 85                              53                            138Canadian Loan 24 _   15_ 39TOTAL 109                              68                            177
The interest element, to which alone the waiver can be applied, becomesgradually smaller in each succeeding year but, as the Agreements still have48 years to run, we should, in settling tactics, have regard to the future morethan to the year 1953 itself.4.        I do not think that in the light of all that has happened the americans should object to our seeking to make the waiver clause effective in years when itclearly ought to operate, or that this need affect our expectations of United Statesco-operation in other economic and financial matters.    Our approach to them onfreer trade and currencies has met with a temporising response;  the prospects of their taking early and effective steps to increase the dollar receipts of therest of the world through trade and investment are not good;   we have no reasonto expect any early move by them in response to our suggestions about an all-round settlement of war debts;  and the United States direct aid for our defence programme for the 1953/54 appropriation may be a half (or even less) of theamount which Congress voted for 1952/53 - i. e. a reduction of about$200 millions.    Moreover, when we paid the 1952 instalment in full I advised the then Secretary of the United States Treasury of our intention to ask in due course, under Section 12 of the Agreement, for reconsideration of Section 6(iii)of the Loan Agreement, which debarred us from making a claim for 1952.Section 12 of the Agreement says:-&quot;Either Government shall be entitled to approach the other for a reconsideration of any of the provisions of this Agreement,if in its opinion the prevailing conditions of international exchangejustify such reconsideration with a view to agreeing upon modifica-tions for presentation to their respective Legislatures. &quot;(A copy of my letter to Mr. Snyder (the then Secretary of the United states treasury) was sent to Mr. Abbott (Canadian Minister of Finance) since our obtain-ing the v/aiver on the Canadian Loan depends on our obtaining it on the UnitedStates Loan. )5.        My colleagues will remember that under the United States Loan Agree-ment (Command 6708) there are three main  conditions which have to be satisfiedbefore we are entitled to the waiver.The first (Section 5(a) of the Agreement) is that we consider the waivernecessary in view of present and prospective conditions of international exchange and the level of our gold and dollar reserves.    This is a unilateral judgmentwhich we make at the time when we decide to claim the waiver, and no difficultyneed ever arise on it.The second condition (Section 5(b) of the Agreement) is broadly that theInternational Monetary Fund should certify that our overseas income on average over a certain period preceding the year of claim was not enough to pay for thevolume of imports we took on average over the years 1936-1938.    We can livewith this provision, which created no obstacle in 1951 and 1952,and is unlikely to do so for many years ahead.The real difficulty arises on the third condition which is embodied inSection 6(iii) of the Agreement.    This is an extremely complicated provisionbut its essence may be stated thus.    The sterling balance &quot;releases&quot; in theyear of claim must not exceed a certain proportion (currently about three-eighths)of the releases in the last year in which the waiver was not claimed.
We have contended for several years now that Section 6(iii) of theAgreement is neither meaningful nor practicable.    We have had severalinconclusive discussions with the Americans on the interpretation of theprovision but have not been able to arrive at any agreement.    Apart from the numerous other difficulties in this Section of the Agreement it is not possibleto tell until the end of the year of claim, and perhaps even after the end. of it,whether the condition is satisfied.    In the longer run the only satisfactory solution (apart from a general debt settlement - paragraph 2) from our pointof view would be the deletion of Section 6(iii) altogether from the Agreement.This could only be done by invoking Section 12 of the Agreement and would,assuming that we had succeeded in persuading the Administration to accept such revision, involve presentation-to Congress and Parliament.6.        Our Ambassador in Washington has been consulted about the timing and form of an approach to the United States on this matter.    Fie advises that itwould not be practicable to obtain a revision of the Agreement this year sincethe Administration do not wish to have an Autumn Session of Congress and theUnited States legislative programme for the summer is already-y over-crowded.He recommends that we should tell the United States Administration that we arevery likely to claim the waiver this year, that we dislike Section 6(iii) of theAgreement, but that we are prepared to leave this over for the time being inview of the fact that United States foreign economic policy as a whole is atpresent under review.    The Ambassador recommends further that we shouldtake another look at the position in September or October.7.        I have considered the Ambassador&apos;s advice carefully but I seedifficulties in following the tactics and timing he suggests.    In my letter toMr. Snyder, telling him we had decided to pay the 1952 instalment in full, i expressed to him, in accordance with our decision then, &quot;our intention to ask,in due course, for reconsideration of this provision (Section 6(iii) of the Agree-ment) under Section 12 of the Agreement&quot;.    We have already had some inevitabledelay in giving effect to this intention.    I think further delay in asking for revision under Section 12 would appear at least odd to the Americans and mightwell prove costly to us.    Already, as the Ambassador has warned us, it will almost certainly be impracticable to give effect to any revision of the Agreement,assuming the United States Administration agree to it, before the 1953 instalmentfalls due.    Negotiations for revision may well take a long time and I think it seven now not too early to begin negotiations if we are to have a chance of a revision which will be in operation for 1954.    Another factor to be borne in mindis that Parliamentary and public (questioning of continuous failure to obtain the waiver is bound to arise and we must be in a position to show that we have doneall we can to secure it.8.        The tactics indicated in paragraph 7  - i.e. pressing now for a funda-mental revision of the Agreement, may very well not help us in regard to theinstalment due at the end of this year:  but, if we have to choose between thesetwo, there is no doubt that it is more important from our point of view to getthe Agreement rectified in relation to the subsequent 47 instalments than toobtain the waiver for 1953.    We can however consider our line as regards 1953in the light of United States reaction.9.        There are two other points about Section 12 of the Agreement which Ishould bring to the notice of my colleagues.
Firstly, Section 12 entitles us to negotiate for a revision of the Agree-ment but the United States Administration may say that they are not convinced of the merits of our case in regard to Section 6(iii) and that they cannot recommend the revision we seek.    If negotiations prove abortive in this way, we shall haveto reconsider the position generally and in relation to the payment falling due on 31st December, 1953.The second point is that under Section 12 the United States also is entitled to ask for revision of the Agreement.    They may use the occasion ofthe negotiations to seek revision of other parts of the Agreement, for exampleSections 8 and 9 under which we undertook convertibility for sterling in thehands of non-residents and non-discrimination against imports from the UnitedStates.    These specific obligations under the Agreement lapsed on31st December, 1952, but the United States might now seek to revive them.    Onthis I think we must wait events.    There is some hope that in view of theirattitude on our &quot;Collective Approach&quot; proposals they will not seek to raisethese issues now on the Loan Agreement.10.       My recommendations in the  light of the foregoing are as follows:-(a) We should ask our Ambassador to give notice underSection 12 of the Agreement that we wish to open negotiations for the revision of the Agreement bythe excision of Section 6(iii).    Our aim would beto have this done as quickly as possible, althoughthe Americans are likely to say, and we will haveto accept, that it will be impracticable to complete the revision before the end of 1953.(b) We should not specifically and separately raise at thisstage the question of the waiver for 1953.    We should consider our line on this in the light of United Statesreactions to our approach under (a) above.(c) We should leave for consideration at the time how weshould react to any proposals the United States maymake for revision of other parts of the Agreement..(d) If the negotiations prove abortive, we should reconsider the position generally and the question of paymentof the 1953 instalment in particular.(e) In any event we should ask the International monetary fund to proceed with preparatory work for theprovision of a certificate of the kind required forsatisfaction of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.    &quot;Wewould inform the Americans that we were doing this.(f) We should ask our High Commissioner to inform theCanadian Government of our general line of thought and action.R.A.
