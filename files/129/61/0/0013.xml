(53) 162 I have had a long talk with thenew Prime Minister of Pakistan, the substance of which is recorded in the attachednote.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,1st June, 1953.Copy No. n -0 JRecord of Conversation between the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Mr. Mohammed Ali, on26th May, 1953I had a long talk with the Pakistan Prime Minister yesterday afternoon. he told me that his Cabinet was working well and working as a team and that on his visit to East Bengal he had had a measure of support, practically unanimity, whichhad surprised and heartened him.2. The Prime Minister had no intention of raising the question of a Republicat the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference.. Personally, he would wish to maintain thepresent position. Much as he wished this it would be difficult for him to do so.Nazimuddin had not only had a Cabinet meeting which had decided definitely infavour of a Republic, though not, as I understood him, fixing any date; but Nazi-muddin had also informed the Party caucus of this decision. He had a number ofmembers of Nazimuddin&apos;s Cabinet in his own Cabinet.3. It would be necessary for him.to recall the Constituent Assembly soon after he got back and take some decisions about the Constitution. It was certainlynecessary to deal with the religious clauses which must be got rid of. It waspossible, though not easy, to deal with elements in the Constitution separately andpiecemeal.4. I told the Prime Minister that if he were to declare for a Republic soon after the Coronation this would be taken as a direct rebuff to the new Queen, andhe and Pakistan would forfeit the great measure of sympathy and goodwill theyenjoyed in this country to-day. Surely it was possible to avoid raising the issue inthe near future? He had got strong popular support in his own country. He him-self had said that this.was due largely to the fact that the late Government had44299
failed to handle the economic and other urgent problems in Pakistan and that thecountry looked to him to deal with these. The question of a Republic could not inany way be considered urgent, and if he was able to avoid it now and his Govern-ment made good the situation might never arise.5.   The Prime Minister said that in addition to Nazimuddin&apos;s commitments,\ there was a strong feeling in Pakistan that they got no better treatment,.....indeed:&apos; perhaps worse treatment, than India, though India was a Republic. I,.said thathe certainly could have no complaint against our Government on the way theyhad been treated. On Kashmir and on the water supplies, we had Consistentlytaken the line which had been discussed fully with his own Foreign Minister,and Zafrullah Khan had agreed that on both issues we were taking the most helpfulline to take.6. The Prime Minister accepted this, but he said his people did not draw theline between the accession of. our Government and the past. They looked at eventssince India became a Republic as a whole. &quot;In particular one thing had greatlyrankled, namely, the orders to British officers that, if civil war broke out, they mustsever their connection with the Pakistan fighting forces. It was true that this had applied equally to India and Pakistan; but it was very unequal in its effect.Pakistan had far more British officers than India, and they were occupying keypositions. -7.1 pressed the Prime Minister most strongly, in his own interest and theinterest of his country, to have the courage of his own convictions and to avoid the Republic issue. His personal position was very strong and he would strengthenit still further if he took a firm line on the Republic, certainly at this time.8. The Prime Minister also discussed with me his forthcoming meetings withNehru. He said he was reasonably hopeful of being able to get a settlement overKashmir. He would not start in with any blue-prints: he would be prepared todiscuss any solution which was fair to both, sides. He was reasonably confident,too, that the water question could be settled. The Prime Minister entirely agreed with the line we had taken at the United Nations Organisation in having all actionsuspended for the time being, and in the advice we had asked Sir Roger Makins,our Ambassador in Washington, to give to Mr. Foster Dulles, the Secretary of Stateof the United States State Department.9. The Prime Minister said he hoped that this was the first of many frankand friendly talks. We have at any rate established a relationship in which wecan be entirely frank with one another.SWINTON.27 th May 1953,
