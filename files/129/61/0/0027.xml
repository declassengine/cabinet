(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST&quot;!GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 17719th JUNE,   1953.CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the Postmaster-general as requested by the Cabinet on 17th June (C.C.(53) 35thConclusions, Minute 4) I have had discussion with the Chancellorof the Exchequer.   I circulate alternative versions of a statement to be made in Parliament.   The advantage of the additionalparagraphs is that they indicate the type of safeguard that theGovernment has in mind, and may well reassure wavering friends.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.19th June, 1953.
ST ATEIvIENT ON TELEVISION DEVSLOPMENTTO 35 MADE 3Y THE ?OC-TMASTER-GENERAL.I am glad to inform the House that the Government is now in aposition to agree that the B.B.C. should proceed on 1st July with certainprojects that will make television available to another 6-7 million people.They can also now make a start with Very High Frequency (V.H.F.) to helpimprove the sound services in areas where it is not now satisfactory.2. New television stations will be set up at Aberdeen, Belfast,the Isle of Wight, -Plymouth and P&apos;on top Pike, the London Station will be removedto Crystal Palace and stations will be erected to serve the Channel Islands andthe Isle of Man.3. As was made clear in last year&apos;s White Paper, the Governmentaccepts the principle of competition but intends that the 3.3.C. should have agood start in proceeding with the developments I have just mentioned.Commercial television will enlarge the public&apos;s choice without in any wayaffecting the service they now receive, and will continue to receive, from theB.B.C.  The Government is fully aware of the anxieties which have been expressed and realises the vital need to impose a strict control over thisextended field of television;  it is determined to carry out to the full the undertakings it has given.   It proposes to present a new White Paper in theautumn explaining how it would exercise this control and how it envisages thatThis commercial television will develop.   /The House and the country will then besentence in a position to exercise a proper judgment in good time before a decision istransfer-taken by Her lvlajesty&apos;s Government to issue the necessary licences, of which,red to      as has been stated, the terms and conditions will first be subject to the approvalend in      of Parliament. 7alterna-tiveversion.4. This White Paper will make it clear that the conditions underAddition-which commercial television licences will be issued and the oversight whichal para-  will be exercised over licensees by the Controlling Body under directions tographs     be given to it, will be such as to remove any reasonable misgivings thatfor alter-commercial television could be harmful or debase taste,nativeversion.     5. The position will be entirely different from that in the UnitedStates.   There, all broadcasting is sponsored and there is no equivalent of the B.3.C.  In the Government proposals, contrary to much of what has beenasserted,the 3.3.C. remains intact, its scope is being extended,its revenue is  13 millions a year and is increasing daily with every new licence;its whole position, revenue, and present basis of working will continue unaffected.To compare what we propose to do here with the system operating in the UnitedStates is therefore both unreal and misleading.6. Although many may regard this as the greatest safeguard of all,we intend in addition to exercise a close control over commercial television and the House may be interested to know the lines on which we propose to lay down safeguards:-(i)    The owner and operator of a station to whom a licence hasbeen issued, and not the provider of programmes or the sponsor, ,will be the person responsible for what is broadcast.
to(ii) A Controlling Body will be set up to see that commercialprogrammes conform with the rigorous standards to be laiddown.   It will have power to call for a script in advance of presentation, to warn a station which has offended against theletter or spirit of those standards, and to make recommendations to the Postmaster-General that the licence of any particularstation should be suspended or withdrawn.(iii) It is not contemplated that a licence will be granted toany company not registered and financed in the United Kingdom.(iv) So as to prevent monopoly, the number of stations under any one ownership or control will be limited.(v) The number of licences to be issued during the first year will be limited, in order to ensure that the experiment will proceed in a steady and orderly manner.(vi) As stated in last year&apos;s White Paper, the televising of religion and politics will be barred.   This would have prevented the televising of the Coronation Abbey service by commercial interests.   It is also probable that all State ceremonies willbe excluded from sponsored programmes.(vii) The maximum and minimum number of hours the stations would operate would be specified, as well as any restrictionson the advertising of certain products, the percentage of time and theplace to be allotted to advertising matter in any programme, andthe proportion of imported programme material to be permitted.Interruption of programmes will be drastically controlled, ifnot entirely ruled out.7. It will be seen that the Government is aware of the anxietiesthat have been expressed and of the need to avoid abuse.   The White paper which I have mentioned will define the field in which commercial televisionwill be permitted to operate, and will contain more information about thenecessary safeguards.   The House and the country will then be in a position toexercise a proper judgment in good time before a decision is taken by her majesty&apos;s Government to issue the necessary licences, of which, as has been stated, the terms and conditions will first be subject to the approval ofParliament.
