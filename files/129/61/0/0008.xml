CONFIDENTIAL0.(53)15818TH MAY, -1953UNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE community memorandum by the Minister off state in C.(53)111  the Foreign. Secretary described his instructions to Sir Frederick Hoyer Millar for conversations with .M. Alphand, which he hoped would succeed in harmonizingAnglo-French views.   As a result off these conversations,agreement has been reached on a set off proposals which, with one exception, accord, with the proposals approved by theCabinet on 26th February.    (C,C.(53)15th Conclusions, Minute k)2.     The sole remaining point off difference is the form inwhich to record the agreed measures for United Kingdom associa-tion with the European Defence Community (E.D.C.).    The FrenchGovernment hold strongly that these measures should be recorded in the form of an agreement which would be signed by the E.D.C.Governments and Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    The other E.D.C.Governments may well support the French.   Hitherto we haveresisted the idea of a formal agreement on the grounds that a unilateral declaration off British intentions would be more appropriate..  But in view&apos;off our interest in securing ratifica-tion of the E.D.C. Treaty, I recommend that we should accept a formal agreement iff this proves to be the wish of the E.D.C.Governments.    Cabinet approval is therefore sought to authoriseSir Frederick Hoyer Millar to circulate to the E.D.C. interim commission, as an alternative to the draft Declarationpreviously circulated, the annexed draft Agreement (Annex I),the text of which has been provisionally agreed with M. Alphand.When circulating this text Sir Frederick Hoyer Millar would indicate that the United Kingdom preference is still for thedraft Declaration, but that once agreement has been reached onthe subdtanoe off our association with the E.D.C., we shall beready to reconsider the matter of form in the light of views expressed by the E.D.C. Governments.   The proposed extension&apos;of the duration of the North Atlantic Treaty would then formthe subject off a separate declaration the text off which is alsoannexed (Annex ll) *3.      The passage off the E.D.O. and Bonn Treaties through theGerman Upper House on 15th May will, it is hoped give a freshimpetus to ratification elsewhere.    The Interim commission have pressed for early discussion off our proposals- if possiblein the third week of May - and the moment seems propitious forreaching agreement with the E.D.C. countries on the basis of four own proposals.S*L.COPY NO.CABINETForeign Offffice, S.W.118TH .MAY, 1953*
