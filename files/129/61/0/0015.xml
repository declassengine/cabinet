Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1953SECRET Copy No.    g1^C. (53) 1655th June, 1953CABINETRELATIONS WITH SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of a long conversa-tion which I have had with Dr. Malan, the Prime Minister of South Africa.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,5th June, 1953.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and Dr. Malan on Sunday, 31st May, 1953I dined alone last night with Dr. Malan and the South African High Com--missioner, Dr. Geyer. Though we talked for three hours the conversation was more noticeable for the matters Dr. Malan did not raise than for those which lie did.2. Dr. Malan&apos;s only reference to a Republic was to ask what was the positionin Pakistan. He said that Nazimuddin had said at the last Conference (presumablyto Havenga) that Pakistan would become a Republic. I told Dr. Malan thatthis was not at all certain under the new regime; and that I thought MohammedAH would very much wish to leave things as they are. I felt sure Mohammed Alirealised that if Pakistan were to declare a Republic at this time, when everywherethere was a spontaneous upsurge of love and loyalty to The Queen, that would beregarded as a direct rebuff to the Queen, and would forfeit all the public sympathythat Pakistan enjoyed here today. The whole climate was quite different from thetime when India became a Republic. In spite of this obvious opening Dr. Malansaid nothing about his own position or intention.3.   Although he talked a great deal about Africa and Africans Dr. Malan did -not raise the question of the Protectorates.  At the end of the evening when wewere leaving, the High Commissioner said &quot; We have not talked at all about theProtectorates. I think the Prime Minister will want to talk to you about that sometime.&quot;  Dr. Malan said nothing.4. I was particularly interested in What Dr. Malan said about the future ofthe Commonwealth. He introduced the subject. He emphasised the importanceof the old Dominions in defence and in common outlook. That was Where thereal strength of the Commonwealth lay and the real unity too. when mr. Gordon Walker was in South Africa, he said to Dr. Malan that the Gold44318
Coast, the West Indies and perhaps Nigeria would before long attain Common-wealth status. What was the position of the United Kingdom Government withregard to that? I said our position was perfectly clear and had been publiclystated. It was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government to decide what measure of self-government should be given to Colonial territories. but even if a Colonial territory attained complete self-government, that did not carry with it automatically full Commonwealth status. The attainment of that fullstatus would be a matter for all the existing Members of the Commonwealth.Dr. Malan was very pleased and said that that was entirely satisfactory.5. Dr. Malan then asked me how I thought we could in fact meet thesituation, which would arise sooner or later. I emphasised that it would be most unwise to say anything publicly in advance. But I thought it might be possibleto arrive at a position where there was in practice a difference in fact, if not instatus. For example, there were matters like defence in which the position of commonwealth countries was in fact different. Dr. Malan said that he thought this was a good line of approach. There was that sort of differentiation now.On some matters the old Dominions were given full information and taken into full consultation, while there was more limited information and consultation withthe Asiatic countries.6. Dr. Malan then went on to talk about what he called the African problem.He said that it affected the whole of Africa, and we all had to face the positionof whether the Africans sooner or later were to dominate. This affected everyColonial Power as well as the Union of South Africa. I said it was not the sameproblem everywhere. For example, West Africa was not a white man&apos;s country.On the other hand when you came to Rhodesia, that was as much the home,generation after generation, of the white population as of the black. What wouldbe a suitable constitutional development in West Africa would be wholly unsuitablein Rhodesia. Dr. Malan knew the lines on which we were proceeding there.Dr. Malan had no criticism of what we were doing in Rhodesia. He seemed indeedquite friendly about it. He only asked whether we were going forward withFederation, to which I replied emphatically &quot; yes .&quot;.7. Dr. Malan&apos;s next point was the activities of Africans who wanted and were planning complete African domination. He said for example that he had read ina newspaper that Nkrumah was organising a pari-African conference of leadingAfricans from every country in Africa. I said this was the first T had heard of itand it sounded to me most unlikely. Nkrumah had his work cut but for him inthe Gold Coast. There was no unity in West Africa, and Nigeria which is itselffar from united would not follow a Gold Coast leacj. I hoped Dr. Malan wouldnot believe all he read in the papers. This led both Dr. Malan and the HighCommissioner to say that it would be very helpful if they &quot;could-have more factual information about what was going on in our African territories. We give themcomplete information about &quot;foreign affairs, defence, trade and other subjects andalso tell them of our ideas and plans on these matters; but they really knew nothingauthoritative about what was happening in West Africa or East. Africa or of ourpplicy. I said I thought it was very desirable that they should have correct infor-niation about this, and that I would certainly talk to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies who, I was sure, would feel the same way. I have since spoken toMr. Lyttelton, who entirely agreed.8. Dr. Malan then suggested that it would be a good thing if the colonial powers could get together more and discuss their common problems. Not onlythe United Kingdom and South Africa, but the French, Belgians and Portuguese aswell. He then adumbrated the rather alarming idea that these countries might allmeet and formulate ah&quot; African Charter.&quot;. I said that ! did hot think it would bea very gbod idea that we should meet with the declared object of discussing ho\ywe were to treat Africans: but there were a lot of other questions, trade, railways,air transport, health, &amp;c, on which we could very usefully meet in some way or another and exchange ideas. And when you met for one object, you could talk about other things on the side and off the record.&apos; Dr. Malan chhckled and said:*&apos; You English are very illogical, but you have a lot of commonsense.&quot;9. Dr. Malan then got on to the continual attempts by the United nations organisation (U.N.O.) to interfere in native affairs and domestic policy. I said thatour line on this was. clear and consistent.   We maintained that it had been agreed
at San Francisco and laid down in the Charter that it was no business of theU.N.O. to interfere with matters which were the domestic concern of any country.Our representative had consistently taken this line at the U.N.O. I had alreadybeen approached more than once by the Indian Government on this matter. Ihad told the Indian Government that we should firmly maintain this line over anyaffairs of our own or the affairs of any other Commonwealth country. Dr. Malanwas appreciative of the line we had taken.10. Dr. Malan then proceeded at length to talk about Indian interference inAfrican affairs. This went far beyond any proper discussion of the position of indians in his territories or ours. In Dr. Malan&apos;s opinion Mr. Nehru was deter-mined to play an ambitious and dangerous role in Africa. He thought Nehruwanted to off-load surplus Indian population on Africa. But, even more dangerous and insidious was his aim to become the Protector of Africans everywhere in Africa.Nehru had started with the idea that he and India would be the supreme power in asia. Nehru had been beaten in this by Mao Tse Tung in China. Having failedin China Nehru wished to extend his empire to Africa.11. We talked for three hours; and as our talk went on I thought Dr. Malantalked more and more without reserve, though no doubt he selected his topics.To-day, Dr. Geyer, whom I have found to be a frank and trustworthy friend andwho is very close to Dr. Malan, told me that Malan had been very well pleased withour talk. Geyer said that Malan had talked without any reserve and with greatfreedom and that they were both glad I had done the same.SWINTON.1st June, 1953.
