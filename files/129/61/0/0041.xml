THE REGENCYNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate by the direction of the Prime Minister for consideration by theCabinet at its meeting on Wednesday, 27th May, a minute from the Lord Presidentof the Council to the Prime Minister covering a memorandum on the subject ofthe Regency.Attention is drawn to the particularly secret nature of the attached documents.They are circulated to members of the Cabinet only for their personal consideration.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th May,-1953.Prime minister the REGENCYAs requested I have discussed the questions raised in the attached memoran-dum with the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Commonwealth secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.  Our recommendations are as follows.The Regency (paragraphs 1-6)2. Subject to a reservation by the Secretary of State for Scotland, which is recorded in paragraph 3 below, the Committee agreed that the Government should invite Parliament to give effect to the Queen&apos;s wish that the Duke of Edinburghshould become Regent in the event of her death or incapacity.In reaching this conclusion we proceeded on the assumption, which we under-stand to be correct, that the Queen&apos;s view on this matter will be shared by the royal family as a whole and, in particular, by Princess Margaret. We should be glad if it were possible to make this clear when any announcement comes to be madeon the subject.We further recommend that, as between the alternative forms of provisionset out at (a) to (c) in paragraph 6 of the memorandum, an ad hoc arrangement inrespect of the Duke of Edinburgh only should be adopted. This would mean that,in the event of the Duke&apos;s death or incapacity, the position would revert to what it now is under the Regency Act, 1937, and the adult next in line of successionwould become Regent.44454Printed for the Cabinet.

21st May, 19533. The Secretary of State for Scotland, although he would greatly regret thenecessity to tender to the Queen advice which would be unwelcome to her, would greatly prefer that any alteration of the Regency arrangements embodied in the1937 Act should take the form of providing for a Council of Regency comprisingPrincess Margaret, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, the Duke ofGloucester and the Princess Royal. He considers that such i a Council of Regencywould be more in keeping with the hereditary principle on which the BritishMonarchy is based and would also provide more satisfactorily for all possibleeventualities.4. We were reminded in this connection that the historical evolution ofRegency arrangements in this country had been from a Council of Regency, through a Regent advised by a Council of Regency, to a single Regent and that the adoptionof a single Regent reflected the growth in the power of Ministers responsible toParliament, and the corresponding decline in the powers exercisable by royal prerogative.The Guardianship (paragraphs 7-8)5. We all agree that, whatever decision may be reached on the question ofthe Regency, provision should be made whereby, in the event of the Queen&apos;s death,the Duke of Edinburgh would become guardian of the Sovereign as well as of hisother children. This also should be an ad hoc arrangement in respect of the duke of Edinburgh only.Incapacity of the Sovereign (paragraph 9)6. We think it would be difficult to justify the proposition that, in the eventof the Queen&apos;s incapacity, Prince Charles should not become Regent until heattained the age of 21 whereas, in the event of the Queen&apos;s death, he would becomeKing (without a Regent) on attaining the age of 18. Although every proposal for additional changes in the arrangements embodied in the Regency Act, 1937 would increase the scope for Parliamentary discussion and controversy, we recommendthat the 1937 Act should be amended so as to provide that, in the event of the queen&apos;s incapacity, Prince Charles could become Regent on attaining the age of 18.The Commonwealth Position (paragraphs 10-14)7. We have asked the Lord Chancellor to advise whether or not the RegencyAct, 1937 must be held to apply to Australia and New Zealand. For the rest, we accept the view of the Commonwealth Secretary that no other commonwealth country would wish either to be covered by fresh United Kingdom legislation onthe subject of the Regency or to pass legislation of its own on this subject untilpractical need for it had arisen. Our objects at the forthcoming Meeting of Com-commonwealth Prime Ministers should, therefore, be (i) to secure the agreement ofother Commonwealth Governments that we should alter as proposed above thestatutory provision for Regency as it affects the United Kingdom; and (ii) to-obtain such assurances as we can that, if the need actually arose, they would atonce invite their Parliaments to enact the legislation necessary to ensure that thesame person was recognised as Regent for all the Commonwealth countries owingallegiance to the Crown.&apos;i       MUfm,    mt&amp; i&amp; ^M-ri-M silver 1I&amp;     [-SSp &apos;   s.
I &apos; . - fiiifMEMORANDUMTHE REGENCYIt is understood to be The Queen&apos;s wish that, before she leaves on herI    Australian tour, provision should.have been made whereby, if she should die beforePrince Charles attains the age of eighteen, the Duke of Edinburgh would becomeRegent.   Such provision would require amendment of the Regency Act of 1937.I    Early amendment of this Act is necessary in any case to meet The Queen&apos;s wishI    that it should be made possible for the Queen Mother to act as Counsellor ofState under the Act.  A Bill for this latter purpose has already been informallyI    approved by the Legislation Committee and was to have been introduced and carried through^ Parliament shortly after Whitsuntide.   If the provisions in the1937 Act in regard to the Regency are to be altered it is clearly desirable that thereshould be a single Bill amending the-Act for both the purposes proposed.  Sucha Bill could not, however, be ready for introduction until rather nearer the summer recess.The Regency Act, 19372.   Section 3(1) of this Act provides that the Regent shall invariably be that person who, being a British subject of full age domiciled in this country and notI a Roman Catholic or married to one, is next in the line of succession to the Crown.Under the proposals first formulated by the Government in 1937 the Sovereignwas to have been empowered to nominate, in advance by letters patent, the person to act as Regent who might be either the Royal Consort or the mother ofI the Heir to the Throne or any person in the line of succession to the throne. The then Leader of the Opposition (Mr. C. R. Attlee) was consultedwhile the Bill was in preparation and, following representations by him, the3    Government decided that it would be better, to make a statutory selection of thei next Heir rather than leave the matter open with the possibility of disagreement inthe event both between the Sovereign and his Ministers (as it was recognised thatI the nomination of a Regent by letters patent could not be made save on the advice of Ministers) and between the United Kingdom Government and other Common-wealth Governments. In presenting the Bill to both Houses of Parliament Ministerslaid particular stress upon the permanence of the arrangements in regard to the regency embodied in the Bill. Thus, the Home Secretary (Sir John Simon) said in the House of Commons when moving the Bill&apos;s Second Reading on 2nd February,1937, (Hansard, Column 1451): -&quot;The present Bill does not seek to deal with a special case in circumstances where it might be desirable but it makes a general provision which would beavailable and applicable should occasion arise at any time hereafter.&quot;In the House of Lords Lord Donoughmore regretted the inelasticity of Clause 3I of the Bill (Hansard, 10th February, 1937, Columns 91-94) and Lord Dickinsonmoved unsuccessfully in Committee an amendment-to insert the words &quot; unless Parliament otherwise determines &quot; to -emphasise the possibility that future circum-stances might make other arrangements in regard to the Regency desirable. Inreply, Lord Halifax, on behalf of the Government, emphasised that the whole objectof the Bill was to have &quot;an automatic plan&quot; (Hansard, 16th February, 1937,Columns 157-161).. 3.  On the choice of the person to be statutorily designated as Regent, sir john Simon said (Hansard, 2nd February, 1937, Column 1455):  &quot; The most natural person to choose is the person next in line of succession,if he is of full age and resident in the country, who would succeed tothe Throne.&quot;The choice of the next in the line of succession represented a departure from the precedents set by the Regency Acts of 1751, 1830, 1840 and 1910 (see Appendix I).The choice made is nowhere explained but may have been due to the facts of the.then situation, namely that the next person of full age in line of succession was the duke of Gloucester and the Queen Consort was not of Royal blood. It should,however, be noted that, alike in 1751, 1830, 1840 and 1910 a younger brother orsister (or in 1840 an uncle) of the Sovereign was available and might have beenpreferred to the Consort (see Appendix II).44454 : b 2
4. The QueerTs present wish is in accord with all the precedents quoted inAppendix I. Moreover, the present situation differs in important respects fromthat of 1937. Thus, the present Consort is a man and of Royal blood and in the direct line of succession to the Throne; whereas the next in line of succession afterThe Queen&apos;s children is a woman and might marry a commoner.5. On the other hand, amendment of the 1937 Act to enable the Duke of edinburgh to act as Regent would involve departure from a principle which Parlia-ment as recently as 1937 intended to be of permanent application and one whichis in keeping with the hereditary basis of the British monarchy. Such a departuremight be regarded by some as an affront to Princess Margaret.6. It is assumed that the only departure from the principle of the 1937 Actwould be to/make different provision for the situation which arises if the Sovereigndies and leaves an Heir under the age of 18 and a Consort. Such a departure might take one of three forms.   It might be:  (a) an ad hoc arrangement in respect of the issue of The Queen and the Duke of edinburgh only;(b) a general provision for all cases in which the situation envisaged abovemight arise;(c) a general provision as under (b), but qualified by the words &quot; unless Parlia-ment otherwise determines &quot; so as to indicate that Parliament recognisedthat there might be a case in which the Consort might not be suitable to act as Regent.The first course (a) above might be the easiest to commend to Parliament as beingthe least radical. On the other hand, (b) might have the advantage of being lesseasily regarded as an affront to Princess Margaret.The Guardianship7. Section 5 of the Regency Act, 1937, would have the effect that, in the eventof The Queen&apos;s death, Princess Margaret (as Regent) and not the Duke of Edinburghwould become guardian of the person of the Sovereign until he or she should attainthe age of 18. This possibility was foreseen by Mr. Ralph Assheton, M.P., duringthe Committee Stage of the Bill in the House of Commons (Hansard, 4th February,1937, Column 1831), but the Government spokesman (Sir John Simon) declined toconsider any amendment and drew attention to the qualifying phrase in the relevantclause &quot; unless Parliament otherwise determines.&quot;8. Whatever decision may eventually be reached on the question of the regency, there appears to be a strong case for providing that, in the event of the queen&apos;s death, the Duke of Edinburgh should be-guardian of the Sovereign. Legis-lation would be required to make this change.Incapacity of the Sovereign9. It has been assumed that, if the 1937 Regency Act is amended to makethe Duke of Edinburgh Regent in the event of The Queen&apos;s death while PrinceCharles is still under the age of 18, provision would at the same time be made whereby the Duke of Edinburgh would become Regent in the event of The Queen&apos;sincapacity. The effect of Section 3 (3) of the 1937 Act would, however, be thatPrince Charles would succeed the Duke of Edinburgh as Regent on attaining theage of twenty-one if at that time The Queen continued to be incapacitated. this position should presumably be preserved.The Commonwealth Position10. In view of Section 4 of the Statute of Westminster it is clear that the&quot;Regency Act, 1937, does not apply to Canada or the Union of South Africa. there seems to be no doubt, however, that that Act applies to Pakistan and.Ceylon, thusproviding in their cases both for a Regency and for regulating who is to be Regent.It might possibly be held that the same would be true of Australia and New Zealand,which had not adopted Section 4 of the Statute of Westminster when the RegencyAct was passed, though this is doubtful.
11. If therefore a Regency becomes necessary in existing circumstances andas the Regency Act now stands, then, in respect of Canada and South Africa therewould be no Regent, in respect of Australia and New Zealand it may be either thatPrincess Margaret would be Regent or that there would be no Regent, and in respectof Pakistan and Ceylon Princess Margaret would be Regent.12. No alteration in the position stated in the preceding paragraph can nowbe made by United Kingdom legislation unless, in the case of all the countries mentioned above except Pakistan, it recited their request and consent, and, in thecase of Pakistan, it were extended to Pakistan by the Pakistan legislature. It isdoubtful whether any of these countries would wish legislation of this kind to be passed for themby the United Kingdom Parliament and they would almost certainlywish, as in the case of the proposed changes in the Royal Style and Titles, that itshould be passed by their own Parliaments.13. If therefore a Regency became necessary in existing circumstances, asmatters now stand there would be no Regent in respect of some of the countries mentioned, and, if the Regency Act were amended so as to name the Duke of edinburgh as Regent, there would both be no Regent in respect of some of thesecountries and a possibility of there being in respect of others a Regent other thanthe Regent in respect of the United Kingdom.14. If it should be decided to amend the 1937 Act in regard to the Regencyall other Commonwealth Governments concerned should be consulted. Theywould probably be reluctant to introduce legislation in their own Parliaments inadvance of the actual event, and the most that could be expected of them would be some assurance that, if the event in fact were to occur, they would be ready totake such action as was required to deal with the situation. In the case of canada and South Africa it may be that they would prefer that all the Royal functionsshould be performed by the respective Governors-General under existing powersbut, although this might be sufficient for immediate purposes, it would lead topractical difficulties if the period of Regency were prolonged for many years.Australia and New Zealand would no doubt be ready to take such action as was required. The attitude of Pakistan and Ceylon cannot be predicted. If it be decidedto propose amendment of the Regency Act by the United Kingdom Parliament soas to name the Duke of Edinburgh as Regent, it would be essential to ascertainthat the Governments concerned saw no objection. The meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers in June would be a suitable occasion on which to broach this matterinformally with other Commonweatlh Prime Ministers.
