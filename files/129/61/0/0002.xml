Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1953Copy No.   70CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the Chancellor or the exchequer have read with great interest the papers on this question by the President ofthe Board of Trade (C. (53) 137) and the Minister of State (C. (53) 151). Mysympathies are with the latter, but I feel I should take this opportunity of raisinga still wider question affecting our relations with Japan.2. The truth is, I think, that we have at the present time no firm policy towards Japan in economic matters. On the one hand, we have been pursuing apolicy directed towards an increase in the trade between Japan and the sterling area and the growing attachment of Japan to the sterling system. On the other,quite apart from the General Agreement oh Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) problem,we have been finding arguments for the restriction of Sterling Area purchases from japan. One result of this ambivalence on our part, is that we are this summertemporarily financing Japan&apos;s purchases from the Sterling Area by means of sterling / dollar &quot; swaps,&quot; to the tune of some  25 millions, Another result may bethat Japan, in her- turn, will later feel compelled to restrict, where possible, herpurchases from the Sterling Area, including ourselves.3. Clearly we cannot for long continue on. these lines. Bilaterally our positionis already somewhat difficult to defend. Where other countries are concerned,however, we can only hope to justify a restrictive attitude towards Japan if there,is a clear case for doing so. This applies particularly to the United States, whom we are asking to adopt &quot;good creditor policies,&quot; and to such CommonwealthSterling Area countries as India, Pakistan and Ceylon,-who in the past have been extremely suspicious of our motives in using balance of payments arguments forthe protection of British industry. -4. My own feeling is that such a case has not yet been made out. I understandthat some two years ago there was set up a special Working Party of officials toconsider our economic policy towards Japan, in the light of the circumstances thenprevailing. One important result of that Working Party&apos;s deliberations was the signature of the Sterling Payments Agreement with Japan which, beyond doubt, hasbeen one of the main factors in the great increase in trade between Japan and the sterling Area during the last two years. Since 1951 the position has of coursechanged considerably. The purchasing power of most Sterling Area countries is less and Japan&apos;s windfall income of dollars from the Korean war may be coming toan end: on the other hand the financial relations of Japan and the CommonwealthSterling Area are closer and Japan has learned many of the advantages of usingsterling.5. It seems to me, therefore, that the time is ripe for a further study of ourposition vis-a-vis Japan and of Japan&apos;s economic prospects in the world to-day.6. Until such a study has been completed, I should be most reluctant to agreeto the proposals advanced by the President of the Board of Trade. My understand-ing is that no immediate decision is necessary and I would therefore recommend tomy colleagues that a suitably constituted Working Party of officials should be set up without delay to study the position and make recommendations to us on our econo-mic policy towards Japan, including the question of Japan&apos;s membership of theG.A.T.T. Since Japan may ask for a payments review in July I suggest that this review should be completed by the end of June.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,11th May, 1953.44191SECRETC.
