HCFOREIGN MINISTERS&apos; MEETING IN WASHINGTONPOLICY TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION AND germany memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State forForeign AffairsGeneralMy colleagues may like to have the following account of my-general approach to the Washington meeting next week, with special reference to twoof the main topics which I shall be discussing there with Mr. Dulles andM. Bidault.    These are (a) policy towards the Soviet Union, and (b) theproblem of Germany and the connected problem of the strengthening of western Europe.    Our tripartite talks will also no doubt cover suchimportant Far Eastern questions as the Korean peace settlement and thefuture of Indo-China and there will perhaps be some reference in tripartitemeetings to the Austrian question.    On these latter issues, however, our policies are clear and well known to my colleagues.    I do not therefore propose to touch upon them in this paper.    Mr. Dulles wishes to discuss with me separately the question of Egypt and on this I am circulating aseparate paper.Object of Washington meeting2.        One of our main objectives is to maintain the initiative in foreignaffairs flowing from the Prime Minister&apos;s speech of 11th May, and to satisfypublic opinion here and elsewhere that the unavoidable postponement of theBermuda meeting of Heads of Governments will not delay our joint efforts to reduce international tension and to compose, or at least ease, existingdifferences.    It is therefore my hope that we may at Washington, withoutpressing the Americans too hard at the moment, at least clear the way fora possible high-level meeting with the Soviet leaders, perhaps later in theyear.    An essential preliminary to such a meeting is, however, the co-ordination of Western, and more especially Anglo-American, policy on themain questions of the day.    It is also most important to demonstrate tothe world, and more especially to Europe, the continued unity and firmnessof purpose of the three Western Powers, and their readiness to continue tomake the sacrifices essential for the joint defence of the free world.    if all goes well, this should be one of the main results of the Washington meeting.Policy towards the Soviet Union3.        There is broad agreement between the three Western Powers, and indeed between all the North Atlantic Treaty Powers, on the interpretation of soviet policy, internal and external, since the death of Stalin.    InternalCABINET/secret.(53) 1873RD JUDY, 1953
///changes, although perhaps less spectacular than some Soviet external moves,are likely to prove more important in the long run.    They amount so far to more incentives and less repression for the Soviet population.    Although thepresent   3 or 5-man Directorate seem to be in control, they lack collectivelyand individually Stalin&apos;s prestige, and the internal situation is clearly lessstable than it was under his absolute authority.    While we should not fallvictims to wishful thinking, there are even possibilities of the situationdeveloping in such a way as seriously to weaken, or at any rate to modify the character of, the Soviet regime.    In the external field there have beenmany steps to reduce international tension, although without affecting basicSoviet long-term policies.    These steps can be explained by (i) a desire onthe part of the new rulers to acquire popularity and to establish their internal position free from external worries;   (ii) fear of America (the atombomb, industrial potential, and possible impatience);  and (iii) a desire to weaken and divide the Western world.    The most important gesture so farhas been Russian support for an armistice in Korea, but broadly speakingthese gestures (for list see Annex), although significant, do not yet amount to much more than &quot;leaving off doing things which we have not been doing tothem&quot;.    It is by no means clear that the present Soviet rulers are anxiousor ready for serious negotiations on current problems;  but it is to our advantage on grounds of policy and public relations alike to test out what may prove to be a new situation in Russia.    At the best we might over aperiod obtain a settlement of some problems;   if no more, we might prolongthe present relaxation in international tension and we might well learnmore about the real intentions and capabilities of the present Soviet leaders.Anglo-American differences about the Soviet Union4.        The main difference between ourselves and the American Administra-tion is that the Americans, no doubt partly influenced by their differentdomestic situation, have hitherto wanted to let events behind the Iron Curtaindevelop further before embarking upon any high-level talks.    There alsoseems now to be a new and more dangerous American tendency, which has its roots in the Republican election campaign and was illustrated in a recentstatement by Mr. Dulles, to interpret the situation behind the Iron Curtainas already very shaky and therefore to advocate new although unspecifiedmeasures to encourage and even promote the early liberation of thesatellite countries.    It is my intention to resist American pressure for newinitiatives of this kind.    A policy of pinpricks is calculated to exasperatethe Russians and is most unlikely to help the unhappy peoples of the occupied countries.    The last thing we want to do is to bait the Russian and satelliteGovernments into taking violent measures against them.    The growing strengthof the West is likely to be the best stimulus to the morale of the subject peoplesWe must of course keep the spirit of freedom alive in Eastern Europe, butwe should also counsel prudence and restraint.    In this, judging by hisPress Conference this week, we should have the support of the President.It is also my intention to try to persuade Mr. Dulles that high-level talks with the Russians, of the exploratory and informal character advocated bythe Prime Minister, held in due time and after proper preparation might do good and could do no harm, and that it would be a great mistake to takethe responsibility upon ourselves of disappointing public expectationsabout such talks.    It should be possible to count on French support on both these issues.
5.        We must, of course, bear in mind the continuing danger of a highly armed Russia, which is moreover relevant also to Mr. Dulles1 policyof pinpricks.    The Soviet Government never disarmed after the war, and inthe years between 1945 and now have succeeded in modernising the soviet forces to a point where they rival the forces of the West in quality, andgreatly outstrip them in number.    The Russian industrial potential haskept pace with this military development.    It is possible that Stalin&apos;ssuccessors may decide to ease up on the pace of military production andindustrial development, but even a significant easing up would still leaveRussia with an expanding economy and advanced armaments programme.We must thus count on being faced by a clearly powerful military threat.It would be a mistake to suppose that, if the Soviet Government made someadjustments in their external policy, they would automatically go over to apolicy of disarmament.    It follows that, even if a detente in relationshipscould be produced as a result of a four -Power meeting, it would still benecessary for the Western Powers to maintain a policy of collective defence and rearmament.    In this view, we should be supported by the Americans.Germany:  the key problem in Soviet relations with the West6.        The Soviet attitude on the Austrian Treaty, which President Eisenhowerlast April coupled with Korea as test cases of Soviet intentions, suggests thatno real progress can be made in easing relations with the Soviet Union inEurope without a discussion of the German problem.    Public opinion inEurope as well as in Germany will not easily be satisfied unless this has atleast been attempted.    The basic approach of the Soviet Union and of theWestern Powers to Germany has been not dissimilar.    Each side has beenequally afraid of the resurgence of a strong Germany allied to, or likely to fall under the influence of, the other party.    There is also a fear, certainlyheld in France, and shared by the Russians, of the re-emergence of a strong,independent and reunified Germany.    The main struggle between the soviet union and the Western Powers since the final breakdown of the Potsdamarrangements in 1947-48 has therefore been for future control of Germany.The three Western Powers, in occupation of nearly three-quarters of thearea and the population of post-Potsdam Germany, and with a successfulrecord of political and economic rehabilitation behind them, have so farhad much greater success than the Russians.    But this success is stillprecarious and too dependent upon the personality of the German federal chancellor, Dr. Adenauer.Alternative Soviet policies towards Germany7.        There are broadly two possible alternative Soviet policies towards germany - (i) defensive, and (ii) expansionist.    The defensive policy hithertofollowed has been to write off the Federal Republic as an outpost of Westerncapitalism and to strengthen Soviet control of East Germany as anothersatellite State, while maintaining Soviet troops on the Elbe and keeping a potential stranglehold upon the Western Allies in Berlin.    The alternativeexpansionist Soviet policy would be to abandon the Communist regime in eastern Germany, allow genuinely free elections and gamble upon the resulting all-German Government being weaned away from association withthe West in the hope that it would sooner or later fall under Russian domina-tion.    While we must always be prepared for a Soviet move from the first to the second policy, there has been no sign so far that the Russians are infact prepared to make what they must regard as a major gamble, since they
would then be running the risk that they v/ould merely have added another18 million anti-Communist Germans to the Federal Republic and so to thestrength of the West,    They would also have set a dangerous precedent ofretreat in Eastern Europe.    The recent rioting in Berlin and in the SovietZone has been a warning to thern of the dangers of an apparently more liberal policy.&quot;Western policies towards Germany8.        United Kingdom policy, which is part of a tripartite policy conducted in concert with the Americans and with the French through the agency of theAllied High Commission, has been to work for the earliest possible associationof the Federal Republic with Western Europe with the aims of (i) ending theold Franco-German feud, (ii) providing the essential German addition to the&quot;Western defence system, and (iii) preventing the revival of dangerous Germannationalism.     This policy is embodied in the Bonn Conventions and theEuropean Defence Community (E.D.C.) Treaty of May, 1952.    It is fully supported by the present German Chancellor and a majority in the federal republic.    As the Prime Minister made clear on 11th May and subsequently,it remains our firm policy that these Treaties, which we ourselves have ratified, should come into force at the earliest possible date.    While work-ing for this immediate aim, we also have the long-term aim of reuniting theSoviet Zone with the Federal Republic.    Any other policy would forfeitGerman goodwill, run counter to historic facts and confront us indefinitelywith the dangers of Russian troops on the Elbe and of our own precariousposition in Berlin.    Reunification can however only be achieved safely andin conditions of freedom on the basis of genuinely free elections.throughoutthe four Zones of Germany followed by the formation of a free, all-GermanGovernment with whom to negotiate a peace treaty.    This policy, laid downin the Allied note to Moscow of 23rd September, 1952, has the support of all german parties other than the Communists, as was shown by the Bundestagresolution of 10th June, 1953.    This dual policy was most recently set outin the Prime Minister&apos;s message to the Federal Chancellor of 24th June.The exchange of notes with the Russians in 1952 showed that, while opposedto the association of the Federal Republic with the West, the Russians werenot prepared to offer terms for German reunification acceptable to the Westor to the Germans themselves.Dr. Adenauer&apos;s position and policy9.        A relatively new factor in the German situation is that, although theFederal Republic remains technically occupied, Dr. Adenauer&apos;s Governmentis now de facto a partner of the three We stern Allies with an effective voice in our counsels and with the acknowledged right to constant consultation on german questions.    The admitted success of Dr. Adenauer&apos;s internalpolicies and the progress he has made in changing Germany&apos;s international status and in the field of Western integration (the Coal and Steel Community,the European Defence Community and the European Political Community)would normally have assured his success in the elections at the end ofAugust.    It is a major United Kingdom and We stern interest that he should succeed.    The possibility of four-Power negotiations or of some new Sovietmove for German unity, coupled with the electric effect of the recent risingsin East Berlin and throughout the Soviet Zone, have however introduced a dangerous element of uncertainty into the German electoral scene. .  hence the necessity for the reaffirmation of our existing policies in the PrimeMinister&apos;s message to Dr. Adenauer of 24th June, which was fully endorsed
libby President Eisenhower and the French Prime Minister.    It is, I suggest,of great importance to Dr. Adenauer that these policies should be reaffirmedyet once more and that Western unity on that basis should be openlyproclaimed after the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting in Washington.    Since theGerman Socialists are campaigning against Dr. Adenauer on a programmeof early four -Power talks for German reunification, it is essential that anyfour-Power talks should be delayed at least until after the German electionshave been completed in early September.    This view will no doubt be strongly held by the American Government, and we can agree with them on it.Uncertainties in Europe10.       The existing uncertainties, to which I have referred above as beingespecially dangerous in Germany owing to the forthcoming elections, arealso widespread throughout Western Europe.    The E.D, C. and similarschemes for European integration are by no means universally popular inFrance or elsewhere.    In France there has long been a fear that western germany as a partner would be likely to dominate the Six-Power communities in Western Europe, and this fear v/ill no doubt be intensified if there is any prospect that the Federal Republic is likely to expand into a reunifiedGermany.    Progress therefore is being held up.     France in particular iswaiting to see whether four-Power talks will take place and, if so, whetherthey v/ill result in German   reunification, and the whole momentum towardsWestern European integration and towards the strengthening of the Westerndefensive system through E.D. C. has for the time being been lost.    the key to this situation is in France, and we and the Americans must make every effort to bring the French to accept their responsibilities by ratifying the E.D.C. Treaty as soon as possible in the autumn.   (We ourselveshave done all we can to this end through undertakings of United Kingdompolitical and military association  which have been found acceptable by allsix E.D.C. Powers.) As explained in paragraph 11 below, much the best position from which to negotiate with the Russians would be with theE.D.C. Treaty in force.   But, in the present state of French opinion, itmay well be that we shall fail to get any definite undertakings out of theFrench government.   In that case the momentum in Western europe will probably not be regained until a real effort has been made by the west to hold four-Power talks and perhaps not until such talks have actuallytaken place, unless it can clearly be shown that the Russians have preventedthem.   We and the Americans would then have to consider whether four-Power talks should not be held before ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty.Clearly, however, they should not take place until well after the Germanelections.11.      It would be greatly preferable if we could embark on four-power talks with a united Europe at our back and with Western Germany safelyanchored to Western Europe, i. e. after the E.D.C. Treaty has been ratified.   The chief Soviet objective at four-Power talks will be to undermine European unity, hold up the integration of Germany into theWest, and prevent the ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty.   The ideal programmetherefore would provide that four-Power talks would only take place after theGerman elections have been held, and after the E.D.C. Treaty has been ratified.  As a matter of tactics it would be wise to announce to the worldat the conclusion of the three-Power meeting that this is what we are aiming at, even though we may privately have reservations about the possibilityof attaining it.
1/5Possible alternative policies towards Germany12.   While the French will argue for delaying ratification of the S.D.C. treaty and the Americans for a more &quot;positive&quot; policy towards the liberation of eastern Germany and of Eastern Europe generally, I do not expect to findMr. Dulles or M. Bidault in disagreement with the continuation of ourpresent German policies as summarised in paragraph 8 above which also have the full support of Dr. Adenauer.   It is, of course, always open to the-Russians to accept our offer of September 1952 and to take their chance ongenuinely free elections throughout Germany.   If they do so, we shall clearly have to agree to discussions, as we and Dr. Adenauer would otherwise loseall German support and the support of public opinion in many other countries.But we should be careful to negotiate on the basis clearly laid down lastyear after the very thorough exchange of notes with the Russians, i. e. thatthe first problem is how to organise free elections, the second to hold suchelections, the third the formation of a free all-German Government, and only then could we proceed to the negotiation of a peace treaty with thatGovernment, which would involve such major questions as frontiers andthe withdrawal of Soviet and Western troops.   We should also have tomaintain the position we have firmly held hitherto that a reunited germany must be free to associate itself with the West.13.        It may, however, be argued that there must be some alternative toour present German policy of anchoring the Federal Republic firmly withinthe Western world through the E.D.C, as a prelude to the eventualreunification of Germany, which can after all only be achieved in agreementwith the Soviet Union.   There are indeed two alternatives:-(1)  direct German membership of theftNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.).   It is however entirely premature to propose this at this stage.It is not desired by Dr. Adenauer himself and it v/ould be even less acceptable to France than the S.D.C. solution.   We hold it however in reserves should the E.D.C. solution finally fail.(2)   the neutralisation of a reunited Germany.   This would no doubt bethe easiest way to reach agreement with the Soviet Union.   But apart fromthe fact that German neutralisation is unacceptable to Dr. Adenauer and tothe majority of the German people it would be highly dangerous for the West.A neutralised Germany with no ties with the West would, if disarmed,soon fall a prey to Russia.   If armed, as proposed last year by the Russians,it would soon fall back into the traditional German policy of balancing Eastagainst-West, or, still worse, into a modern variant of Rapallo under whichthe Germans v/ouldatternptto regain their lost Eastern territories byaligning themselves with the Soviet Union.   Before long such a germany might be little better than a Soviet satellite and the balance of power inEurope would have been fatally shifted to our disadvantage.   We should have lost the essential German contribution to the N.A.T.O. and Western defence.American troops, removed from Germany, v/ould soon be out of Europealtogether.    We could only contemplate such a solution if all else had failedand we were compelled to rely for our future self-preservation upon our confidence in the good intentions of a Soviet Union, which had thus become theactual or potential master of the whole of Europe.
Foreign Office, S.W.1.3rd July, 1953.14. ,        It is clearly important to carry with us not only the Germans butalso our N.A.T.O. allies, and more especially the inner circle of the brussels treaty Pov/ers.   In addition, some degree of consultation is also desirablewith Yugoslavia, if only to prevent the fear that the three Great powers are deciding their affairs over their heads.   I intend therefore to concert with Mr. Dulles and M. Bidault the most effective methods to ensure such consultation.Conclusion15, I hope therefore that my colleagues will agree that our majorobjectives at Washington should be:-(1) to confirm and reaffirm publicly existing policies towards Germany;(2)  to continue to support Dr. Adenauer in his pursuit of these policies;(3)  to press the French to go ahead as fast as possible with ratification of the E.D.C. and Bonn Treaties, as providing (a) the safest policy towards germany, and (b) the necessary basis of strength from which to negotiateeffectively with the Soviet Union;  and to reaffirm publicly after theWashington meeting that this is our policy;(4)  to discourage Mr. Dulles from any dangerous new initiativesintended to provoke early liberation movements behind the Iron Curtain,as distinct from continued support and encouragement of a sx^irit of independence and resistance to Communism;(5)  to agree upon the necessity for maintaining and strengthening themilitary defences of the West, more especially through the N.A.T.O.; this alsoneeds reaffirmation;(6)  to persuade the Americans to keep the door open for high-leveland informal four-Power talks.
