RECOGNITION OF POST OFFICE STAFF ASSOCIATIONSMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralAfter the Cabinet decided last year to defer the question of the possiblerecognition of certain &quot;breakaway&quot; Post Office unions (C. C, (52) 62nd conclusions minute 3), I saw most of the contestants and persuaded them to enter into directdiscussions, with the following results:-(a) The Post Office Engineering Union (P.C.E.U.) and the NationalGuild of Motor Engineers are amalgamating on the basisof agreed constitutional changes in the P.O^E. U. organisa-tion.    This case has therefore been solved in the best possible way.(b) In Engineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association(E.O.(Ti)A;) versus Post Office Engineering Union - themost controversial case - direct discussions failed.By agreement with the parties, and in consultation withthe Minister of Labour, I appointed Sir Richard Lloyd-Robertsas conciliator.    (The suggestion that a conciliator beappointed came originally from the Conservative LabourCommittee.)   He has now reported his inability to find any basis for agreement,(c) In the case of the Union of Post Office Workers (U.P.W.) versusthe National Association of Postal and Telegraph Officers(N.A.P.T.Q.) differences were reduced to a single point, onwhich both parties asked me to appoint two conciliators.The suggested solution, though concurred in by the former,was rejected by the latter.(d) The Association of Controlling Officers and the national association of Telephone Supervising Officers have reporteddisagreement, but they have agreed to my appointingSir Richard Lloyd-Roberts as conciliator, and he is now .at work.    The ultimate outcome of this comparatively minor case is unlikely to affect my general conclusions.2. Engineering Officers (Telecommunications) AssociationAlthough the Cabinet may ultimately be more influenced by wider considerations of general policy it will, I think, expect to hear from me my viewson the merits of the issue.    I should like to make three main points:-COPY NO.   6 5CABINETSECRETC.(53) 15515TH MAY, 1953
1ST(i)  The relations of the Post Office with its staff associations areexceptionally good.    It would be difficult if not impossibleto run the Post Office if anything were done that would destroythese close relations.    To alienate the 87 per cent of the staff who are in the recognised unions would be a serious matter.Rightly or wrongly recognition of &quot;breakaway&quot; unions wouldhave this effect.(ii)  The so-called &quot;Listowel formula&quot; has been throughout the controversy the basis of the E. O. (T.)A. case.    All throughthe debate when our party urged recognition of the E.O.(T,)Aour spokesmen complained of &quot;changing the rules during thecourse of the game&quot; because recognition was not given to a union that had attained a 40 per cent membership.    this argument was based on a complete misconception of the&quot;Listowel formula&quot; which promised only a policy of&quot;considering a request for recognition&quot; when 40 per centmembership was attained.    Consideration is a very different matter from automatic recognition.    Alternatively, it hasbeen contended that, even if there has been no actual rule, ithas at least been the regular practice to recognise an association attaining 40 per cent membership.    This, too, isquite misleading.    No new association seeking recognitionin a field in which there is already a recognised association has in fact been recognised under the &quot;Listowel formula&quot;since it was devised in 1946.    The last occasion when any-thing like this was done was in 1929, 17 years before the birthof the &quot;formula&quot;.    This, incidentally, led to the suspension of the Post Office Whitley Council for over 3 years.(iii)  I have been very influenced in my conclusions by the speech of the present Home Secretary on 5th July, 1951, (Hansard,Column 2627), when he said that in his view there would be aspecial case for recognition &quot;when the following threeconditions co-exist.    First,when there is grave dissatisfactionin a grade or section of workers with its present representa-tion;  second, when those workers affected have exhaustedtheir claims and rights in existing union machinery without success;  and, third, when there is a clear likelihood offurther trouble and injustice to the workers, Certainly neither the second nor the third of these conditions are satisfiedin this case.    Thus:-(a) Out of about 60,000 engineers, the grade of Technical Officers,for whom the E.O. (T.)A. claim recognition, comprises some14,000.    It cannot be contended that the interests of theseTechnical Officers are or have been neglected by the P.O.E.U.when it is realised that members of their grade hold 15 out of23 places on their National Executive Council, and 4 out of 7places on the important Wages and Allowances Committee,and figure largely as branch officer-holders and conferencedelegates.(b) Under existing P.O. E.U. machinery, each separate section is allowed its own separate conference and although theNational Executive Council has ultimate power to overridethe sectional bodies this power is rarely, if ever, used.
(c)   During the discussions of the last few months the P. O, E. U.have offered to provide even greater safeguards, and to alter their rules so that a sectional committee could never be overruled by the Executive Council without a two-thirds majority or even more.    They offered also to discussother safeguards,4. I attach Sir Richard Lloyd-Roberts&apos; report.    He concludes     . .. theinterests of the technical staff appear to have been well served by P.O.E.U, inthe past and would be better served by P. O. E. U. than by E. O. (T.)A. in thefuture This confirms my own view and I can see no justification forrecognising   the E. O. (T.)A. on any other ground.5* National Association of Postal and Telegraph officers the N.A.P.T.O. seeks to represent a grade numbering 21,700;  only 2,600or about 12 per cent are in the N.A.P.T.O., the rest being in the U.P.W.   Onmerit no case has been made to persuade me that the interests of postal and telegraph officers cannot be adequately served by the U. P.W, or that the recognition of the N.A.P.T.O. is justified on the criterion of paragraph 2 above.6, Other Cases(a) National Guild of Telephonists.    The U.P.W. have asked for the with-drawal of recognition from the National Guild of Telephonists, who represent maletelephonists jointly with them.    Whether or not the Guild would be recognised to-day, it has been a recognised association for 24 years.    In my opinion, itwould not be justifiable to withdraw recognition.(b) One dispute which was not considered by the Terrington Committee isworth mentioning.    This concerns the Association of Scientific Workers and theU. P. W. , and caused considerable difficulty in connection with the transfer tothe Post Office of former Cable and Wireless staff.    Full agreement has nowbeen reached by direct discussion between the Associations.7. conclusion in the light of the recent inter-union discussions, the various efforts atconciliation, and my further study of the problem, I conclude(a) that there is no justification for recognising the EngineeringOfficers (Telecommunications) Association or theNational Association of Postal and Telegraph officers or for withdrawing recognition from the National Guildof Telephonists;(b) that no numerical or other automatic formula should bethe basis for settling recognition disputes betweenestablished and &quot;breakaway&quot; Post Office unions;(c) that the public interest and the needs of justice can best be reconciled by following the principles quoted inparagraph 2 (iii) above.If these conclusions are accepted I should propose to make an early statement in Parliament on lines to be agreed with the Minister of Labour.D. &apos;Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.15TH MAY, 1953.
REPORT BY SIR RICHARD LLOYD-ROBERTSMorants Court,Sevenoaks.6th May, 1953.Dear Lord De La Warr,I have the honour to report on the commission you entrusted to me inrelation to the differences between the P.O.E.U. and E. O. (T.)A.I have had two informal talks with Mr. Kilby and two formal discussions with each of the organisations.    The P. O.E.U. representatives wereMessrs. Burdon, Fox, Kilby and Morgan, and those of E. O. (T.)A., Messrs. Cook,Hamblin, Pickles and Wheeler.I regret very much to be compelled to confess to failure.1. E.O.(T.)A. continued to insist that the technical grades concerned had, byreason of the developments in telecommunications, and the consequent measure ofskill and responsibility now associated with their work, justified their claim to betreated as a separate entity in all matters affecting their own pay and conditions -a position impossible of achievement under the present constitution of the P.O.E.U.2. P.O.E.U., rightly in my view, contended that any alterations in its constitution designed to extend the autonomy of the technical section among its membership must apply equally to the other three sections, and E.O.(T.)A.conceded this point, arguing therefrom that P0O.E.U&apos;-s form of organisation couldnot possibly cater adequately for so many grades of employees widely differingfrom each other in skill and responsibility.3. In E. O. (T.)A&apos;s opinion, only a completely separate organisation, federatedfor consultative purposes only, could meet the position and enable the technicalgrades concerned to advance appropriately in pay and status.4. E.O. (T.)A. failed to produce to me, however, any satisfactory evidencethat their members1 interests had been in any way either neglected or prejudicedas a result of the constitution of the P.O.E.U.5. The existence for a long time past of technical officers as a substantial majority on the National Executive Council of P. O.E.U. does not in E.O.(T.)A&apos;ssubmission invalidate its claim for autonomy, because those members of theExecutive Council are not in post as technical officers but as delegates frombranches, mandated as the branches direct and consequently not free to promote the specific interests of technical officers, however much they might desire to doso.6. The P.O.E.U, representatives were very anxious to do all possible tosatisfy E. O. (T.)A. and were willing to consider amendments to their constitution which would enable the technical grades concerned to become homogeneous groupsup and down the country and so be able to deliberate together in the formulation of such proposals as they might want to put forward.7. P.O.E.U. were also willing to provide that such proposals could only be rejected by a two-thirds or even greater majority of the Executive instead of abare majority as at present.
ft8. At one point I had some slight hope of a compromise being reached on the following basis.    I tentatively suggested that if the Executive Councilof P.O.E.U. were unhappy about some proposal affecting technical staff only,it should refer that proposal back for re-examination, with its comments.The officers concerned could then either withdraw it, amend it, or re-submitif unaltered.    In the event of its having been amended, the Executive couldeither approve it, or again refer it back.    If it was re-submitted unaltered,the Executive would have no alternative but to accept it and proceed accordingly as though it were an instruction from the National Conference.Proposals held by the Executive to affect other sections of the membership would continue to be subject to its normal procedure.9. The P.O. E.U&apos;s representatives found themselves, however, unableto fall in with this suggestion, primarily on the ground that no responsibleExecutive could possibly carry out its proper function if it were compelledto sponsor a proposal emanating from a section of its membership without regard to its own opinion as to whether the proposal was well-founded and could be reasonably supported in negotiation or arbitration.    Any Executivedoing such a thing would be abrogating its duty to the organisation as a whole and running the risk of damaging the repute of the Union as a responsiblebody.Further, the P. O. E.U&apos;s representatives anticipated interminablediscussion on the question as to whether a certain proposal did or did not affect another section of the membership,..... &apos;   &apos; - .....10. E. O. (T.)A&apos;s attitude to this tentative suggestion of mine was that itwould be prepared to look favourably on the first part, but as to the second part there must be agreement between the two organisations on the matters which were to be subject to the Executive Councils rejection.111. Apart, however, from the very real difficulty felt by P.O.E.U. asto the first part of my suggestion, I was forced to recognise in the light ofE. O. (T,)Ars general representations to me that the second part of the scheme would fail on the issue as to whether or not certain matters did or did not affect other interests.-12. Minor representations by E.O.(T.)A. could have been satisfactorily-adjusted, e.g. the presentation of Technical Officers&apos; cases in negotiation and in arbitration in a more definitely separate way.    It was suggested byE.O. (T.)A. that the present procedure whereby claims affecting technical officers were presented technically separately, i. e. Technical Officersfirst with other sections following on, was bound to create the psychological effect in the minds of the Tribunal that each claim was in fact part of awhole and not really distinctive for the particular section.13. According to E. O. (T.)A&apos;s representatives, there existed anothermajor barrier to a reconciliation.    It was stated to me that there is a conflict of policy between P.O.E.U. and E. O. (T,)A. on the desirability ofthe technical staff being accepted into the Treasury gradings of technicalpeople.    According to E. O. (T.)A., P.O.E.U. were opposed to that inclusionwhereas E.O. (T.)A. wanted it wholeheartedly.The P.O.E.U, representatives denied to me that they were in anyway opposed as suggested, but had not pursued such a claim because theyhad been convinced of its impracticability.\
if in E. O. (T.)A&apos;s view, however, the attitude of P.O.E.U. in this matter was only another indication that P.O.E.U., by reason of the nature of itsstructure, cannot be sufficiently imbued with the importance of the technical staff nor of their claims to a higher status,14. In my opinion, there is no hope of effecting a reconciliation between these two organisations at the present time.    Apart from the main questiondividing them, there is very evidently a great deal of bitterness - at any rateamong representatives of E.O.(T.)A. - so much so that I believe anycompromise settlement on paper would be ineffective in practice.    Oneremark made to me by E. O. (T.)A. when it seemed barely possible that satisfactory alterations could be made to P.O.E.U&apos;s constitution was &quot;Thatis all very well, but there is nothing to stop P.O.E.U. from reversing its position at its next Annual Conference&quot;.It would obviously be foolish to expect harmony when the representa-tives of one body betray such distrust at the outset.In conclusion, I am not sure whether you expect any personal opinionfrom me on the respective merits of the two cases.    In the&apos; event of yourdoing so, I unhesitatingly say that I do not see how P.O.E.U. could possiblydo what E. O. (T.)A. wants without completely breaking up.    Further, I amof opinion as the result   of two prolonged conferences with both organisationsthat the interests of the technical staff appear to have been well served by.O.E.U. in the past and would be better served by P.O.E.U. than byE.O. (T.)A. in the future, especially if the constitution of P.O.E.U. couldbe amended as referred to in my paragraphs 6 and 7 above.I am disappointed, however, that I have failed in my mission.Yours sincerely,(Signed) RICHARD LLOYD-ROBERTSThe Rt. Hon. Earl De La Warr,H. M. Postmaster General.
