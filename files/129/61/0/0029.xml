(THIS DOCUivlSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos;     &apos; secret.(53) 179 COPY NO. 6 /- -7 22ND JUNE. 1953CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI think I should explain in advance to my colleagues the sjsecial difficulties that I see in point (iii) of the seven points made in paragraph 6 of the proposed statement by the Postmaster General (C. (53) 177).2.     The practical effect of this point, as I understand it, is that we shouldlicense only British companies financed by British shareholders.    This meansdiscrimination against foreign companies on grounds of nationality and, as such,raises an important question of principle.    Many of our companies, notably inthe field of insurance and shipping, have branches registered and established inforeign and Commonwealth countries all over the world.    It is of the utmost importance to us that these branches of our companies should have all thenecessary facilities to carry on their business and it is our constant endeavourto protect them from all forms of local legislation designed to discriminate against them.    I recognise, of course, that special considerations apxoly in thecase of television.    But other special considerations could be readily adducedby foreigners for discrimination in other cases, and I should very much deprecateany action by Her Majesty&apos;s Government which other Governments could,however speciously, cite as a precedent for discriminatory measures against us.This point is important not only in foreign countries but also in certain parts ofthe Commonwealth, particularly India and Pakistan, where we must expectincreasing pressure to concentrate key industries &quot;in national hands.3.     Moreover, it is not clear to me that the confinement of licences to companies registered and financed in this country would necessarily assure the desired result.    Any company, though entirely controlled by British shareholders,would be free to employ foreigners in key posts of management where day-to-daypolicies are settled;  indeed, in view of the experience of the United States in operating commercial television, a United Kingdom company might quite likelythink it good business to employ an American executive who, though he had noshare in the financial control, would exert effective influence on the programmes.4.      In these circumstances I hope very much that my colleagues will agreewith me that it would be preferable to delete point (iii).    It is clearly envisaged in point (ii) that, in any event, we should have to rely on the   Controlling body to use its own powers to enforce the rigorous standards to be laid down.    I think we should leave the Controlling Body to deal administratively with any applicationsfor licences from American or other foreign companies which might (and probablywould) seem unlikely to live up to the spirit, as well as to the letter, of thesestandards.P.T.Board of Trade, S, W.l.22ND JUNE, 1953.
