Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1953SECRETC. (53) 15413th May, 1953CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GOLD COAST ANDNIGERIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Gold CoastOn 12th February, 1952, the Cabinet approved a number of constitutional changes, including the use of the title of Prime Minister, in the Gold Coast(C.C. (52) 16th Conclusions, Minute 6). These changes, proposed in C. (52) 28,took effect in March 1952.2. During my visit to the Gold Coast in June, 1952, the African Ministers,against a background of some carefully prepared &quot; spontaneous &quot; demonstrations,were at pains to impress upon me that they and the country wanted something which they variously described as &quot; freedom,&quot; &quot; self-government now&quot; and&quot; Dominion status.&quot; After a series of discussions, during which I was able to bring home to them, or at any rate to the Prime Minister (Dr. Nkrumah), a certain numberof home truths, I authorised the issue of the following communique:  &quot; During his visit to the Gold Coast the Secretary of State had meetings with the Ministers. The Prime Minister and other representative Ministersmade clear their wish for self-government within the Commonwealth.&quot; There was discussion on the meaning of this term and of whatconstitutional changes were involved. It was agreed by the Secretary of State&apos;that when proposals for constitutional change had been formulated by theGold Coast Government after consultation with the Chiefs and people of theGold Coast they would be examined and discussed between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of the Gold Coast.&quot;3. In October last Dr. Nkrumah spoke in the Gold Coast Legislative Assemblyabout those features of the constitution which might be considered suitable for amendment and asked that political parties and other representative bodies should submit recommendations to him by the end of March 1953. The Gold coast government would then consider those recommendations and embody its own proposals in a White Paper for debate in the Legislature in July next.4. Most of the views thus sought have now been published. The northern territories Council, which represents the poorest and most backward region ofthe territory, wants few changes apart from special help for its development and increased representation in the Cabinet. AH the other groups advance a demand,expressed in different forms, for full self-government forthwith. The Gold coast government will be bound to take&quot; account of this broadly-based demand in formulating its own proposals; it will also be influenced by recent constitutional developments elsewhere such as the Sudan Agreement: I drew attention at thetime to the implications for the African Colonies. It may be assumed therefore that if the Government of the Gold Coast is to continue to be by consent constitu-tional changes are inescapable. The alternative to an early grant of full self-government is agreement on changes which, though substantial enough to earnacceptance, may enable the grant of full self-government to be delayed for a furtherpreparatory period.5. I have discussed the situation fully with the Governor. Although he can give no guarantees, he is reasonably confident that by patient negotiation he will44215
be able to keep the proposals finally submitted to Her Majesty&apos;s government within the following limits:  (a) The posts of the three ex-officio Ministers to be abolished. RepresentativeMinisters would take over the portfolios of Finance, and perhaps also. of Justice. (The Minister of Finance would be assisted by a european economic and Financial Adviser, or by some other machinery like a caisse de la dette, and the post of Attorney-General would become a non-political appointment in the Civil Service.) Defence (includingthe police) and External Affairs would become the direct responsibilityof the Governor.(b) The membership of the Legislative Assembly to be increased and to consistonly of persons chosen by direct elections throughout the territory byuniversal adult suffrage. If a second Chamber, probably with delayingpowers, is proposed it would include representatives of the Chiefschosen by their Territorial Councils and perhaps European representa-tives of the Chambers of Commerce and Mines.(c) The Governors present reserved powers to be retained.The Governor expects that after the debate in the Legislature in July the gold coast Government would appoint a Committee to work out detailed recommenda-tions on electoral reform so that their full proposals could be submitted to her majesty&apos;s Government by about November. The Gold Coast Government would hope that agreement could be reached in time for fresh constitutional instrumentsto be made and new elections held by about July .1954 six months earlier thanthey would be under the present constitution.6. If the Governor&apos;s hopes are realised the next stage of constitutional advance would be restricted to internal affairs. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would retainresponsibility for external affairs and defence, including the police as the principleforce charged with internal security. The Governor has recommended, and I agree, that these subjects should be removed from the Gold Coast Cabinet and made his direct responsibility exercised through a Deputy Governor acting as secretary for Defence. In so far as it was necessary selected RepresentativeMinisters would be appointed to a small Defence Committee over which theGovernor would preside: the Prime Minister would answer questions, and handleother business (e.g., supply), in the Legislature on defence and external affairs;another Minister would similarly handle police matters in the Legislature but theconstitution would reserve overriding control of the Police to the Governor.The objection to the alternative course of seeking to preserve in the Cabinetthe present ex-officio post of Minister of Defence and External Affairs is that itsholder would then be the only European Cabinet Minister: and he could hardly fail to be a target for constant fire.7. There would be thus created an all-African Cabinet, with wide responsi-bility for internal affairs, over which the Prime Minister would normally presideand we might thereby gain a psychological advantage that would draw much ofthe sting from the nationalist attack. A practical advantage is that the deputy governor and Secretary for Defence who would, when necessary, act as Governor,would escape the embarrassment, to which the person who now has so to act is subject, of being normally a Minister junior to the Prime Minister.8. Although these arrangements will not satisfy the wish of the northern territories Council for the retention of ex-officio posts in the Cabinet, their repre-sentatives would take part in the party consultations and in the debate in theLegislature which will precede the final framing of the constitutional proposals ofthe Gold Coast Government, and the Governor has advised me that they are likelyto be reasonably satisfied by a compromise which gives them a quarter of the seats in the Cabinet and leaves control of defence and external affairs to the Governor.9. British Togoland is administered under Trusteeship Agreement as part ofthe Gold Coast and so long as that Agreement is in force Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as part of its general responsibility for the external affairs of the Gold Coast,must retain through the Governor a sufficient measure of control to discharge its obligations to the United Nations.10. I have informed the Governor, who has now returned to the Gold Coast,that there are certain matters on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not preparedto negotiate.  Her Majesty&apos;s Government will insist on retaining responsibility for
external affairs and defence including the police, and the post of Attorney-Generalmust remain a non-political appointment in the Public Service: the rest is open for manoeuvre.11. The position of officers from the United Kingdom, who still hold most ofthe senior appointments in the Gold Coast Service, is safeguarded by the present constitutional instruments under which the Governor can protect their conditionsof service and prospects of a career. Political advance has outstripped the pace atwhich Africans are being trained to occupy responsible posts in the Gold CoastService and there is now increasing pressure to hasten the process of Africanisationof that Service by expedients which would lower its standards and prejudice thenormal prospects of overseas officers. The Governor has advised me that, not-withstanding that pressure, there is good hope that the existing safeguards of overseas officers can be retained at the next stage of constitutional advance. If,however, existing safeguards had to be modified I should feel obliged to insist thatthe Gold Coast Government should forthwith introduce a scheme giving, as an addition to normal pension, adequate compensation for loss of career. To reassure the Public Service I propose to issue a statement to this effect as soon as the Governoradvises me that this would be opportune; the statement would also include myundertaking to offer transfers to overseas officers in the Gold Coast whenever suit-able vacancies occured in other Colonial territories.12. The situation is fluid and we are dealing in the Gold Coast with volatile-human material. It is therefore impossible to forecast events very far ahead. Butif agreement on constitutional changes were reached and a new LegislativeAssembly, elected by universal adult suffrage, met about mid-1954, its first act mightwell be to demand complete self-government as a member of the Commonwealth.In that event the Governor hopes that the position could be held for a period whichmight last as long as three or four years while the country was prepared for greater-responsibility and consideration was given to its form of association with theCommonwealth.   -Nigeria13. I have taken into account the possible repercussions of these develop-ments on West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, and have consulted the Governor of nigeria about them. At one time he was apprehensive lest they should quickenstill further the demand for political advance in the Southern Regions and thuslead to divisions, and strife, between the South and the conservative North. Butas my colleagues will be aware, the latent discord between the three Regions hasalready been brought to the surface by recent events in Nigeria and in particularby the debate on 31st March in the House of Representatives on a private member&apos;motion about the attainment of self-government in 1956.14. As I informed the House of Commons on 22nd April, the situation in nigeria is complicated and will require further patient and careful study. But I amclear that the present cumbersome constitution will have to be radically revised andthat the best hope of preserving the unity of the territory will lie in seeking to reach agreement on some modified and looser form of association at the Centre. TheGovernor agrees that this would probably have to be coupled with some measure ofpolitical advance for example, the widening of the responsibilities and functions ofMinisters but that the arrangements at the Centre would have to be such as tosatisfy the North that their interests were effectively safeguarded.15. A further constitutional advance in the Gold Coast will not make a diffi-cult situation in Nigeria any easier. But by and large Nigeria&apos;s future will, I think,be settled by events in Nigeria; and in any case I see no alternative but to proceed in the Gold Coast on the lines I have described which, as the Governor has advisedme, represent the minimum concessions if we are to secure peaceful and orderedprogress by successive stages.Conclusion16. My colleagues will wish to take note of the position now reached in bothterritories. When the final proposals of the Gold Coast Government are receivedlater this year I will consult them again. I may need to consult them before longabout Nigeria.O. L.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th May, 1953.
