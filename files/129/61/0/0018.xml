Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1953SECRETC. (53) 16811th June, 1953CABINETTHE sudan memorandum by the Minister of state as foreshadowed in the last paragraph of. C. (53) .131, the Umma have nowbeen overtaken by a healthy fear of Egyptian money and propaganda. The Ummaleaders are in correspondence with the Egyptians and, on 23rd May, Sayed SirAbdul Rahman el Mahdi (S.A.R.) received a letter in which Neguib explainedthat even an independent Sudan would have common economic and defencepolicies with Egypt.  This has further frightened the Umma.2. On 27th May I had a long conversation with S.A.R., who was accom-panied by Abdullah Bey Khalil, Secretary-General of the Umma Party, andIbrahim Ahmed, one of the Sudanese members of the Governor-GeneraFs Corn-mission. S.A.R. told me that he regarded Neguib&apos;s letter as quite unsatisfactory.In his opinion, the Egyptians were entitled to assurances about Nile waters, but apart from this the Sudan must be quite independent of Egypt. In a conversationwith Abdullah Khalil at Cairo airport, Neguib had tried to deny that the Egyptianswere spending money to influence Sudanese opinion, and had argued that it wasthe British who were making propaganda in the Sudan. This conversation becameso heated that S.A.R. himself had had to move away. S.A.R. told me that he didnot accept Egyptian denials and had pointed out to Neguib that while the Egyptianshad an interest in persuading the Sudanese to choose union with Egypt, there wasno direct British interest involved in the choice of independence.3. I was told that Abdullah Khalil would soon return to Khartoum (he lefton 7th June) and the Umma executive would draft a reply to Neguib&apos;s letter.They will say that,, unless the Egyptian Government cease their active supportof the Unity Party in the Sudan, the Umma will announce that the agreement reached between them and the Egyptians last October is at an end. I warnedS.A.R. not to be drawn into an endless, inconclusive correspondence. He said he was alive to this danger; he thought a break with the Egyptians was almost certain and the time had come for the Sudanese and the British to work together.I agreed.4. In a discussion of tactics and possible Egyptian moves, I said that it was quite clear that the Egyptians had broken their promises to the Umma, and thelatter should make their position clear publicly. If they declared that, because the egyptians had consistently broken the agreement, the Umma would no longer be bound to it, then Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have the opportunity to support them publicly by saying that the Egyptians had consistently worked against the&quot; free and neutral atmosphere &quot; prescribed in the Anglo-Egyptian agreement ofFebruary and that they were determined that the Sudanese should have a genuineopportunity to choose independence.5. 1 told S.A.R. that, if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to co-operate withthe Umma, there were certain pre-requisites:  (a) the Umma should make their position clear in relation to the Egyptians;lb) the supporters of independence should form a common front the Ummaand the Socialist Republican Party should come to an understanding;(c) in order to get the support of the South, the Umma should give firmassurances that the British administrators would remain in the Southfor some considerable time.Copy No.6544339
6. S.A.R. thought that these conditions could be met. He added a suggestionthat the date of self-determination should be brought forward. He said that relations between the Sudanese and the British had been shaken and mightdeteriorate further if self-determination was delayed, but he was sure they would come right once an independent Sudan came into existence.7.   I said that there seemed to me to be two phases:  (i) In the period between now and the autumn it was necessary to build up.an independence front which would go out to win the elections.(ii) It the elections went satisfactorily, then Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the production-independence Sudanese Government and the British Administra-tion would together be in so strong a position that they would not need to worry too much about Egypt in deciding what to do.8. S.A.R. then asked me whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would buy hiscotton at a favourable price, i.e., at one well above the market price. I said thatit would be impossible to conceal such a purchase, and it would greatly damageS.A.R.&apos;s own position. I said, however, that we would consider how we could help over his cotton, and that we would also consider whether there was any other way in which we could help him and the Umma.9. When I entertained S.A.R. to lunch on 3rd June, there was further discussion about cotton, and I hope that he and perhaps also his son will go toManchester and Liverpool to discuss his problem. I hope that he will see repre-sentatives of the Raw Cotton Commission and the private interests concerned. Weare arranging for him to be made a fuss of.10. It will be seen that there is a chance that the Umma will in the courseof the next week or two break clear of their Egyptian entanglement, and that weshall then be able to work out a plan for co-operation with them which will ensurethat Egyptian attempts to prevent the emergence of an independent Sudan do not succeed. It may be that the Egyptians will then accuse us of wrecking the Agree-ment, and themselves repudiate it, calling on the pro-Egyptian parties in the Sudanto boycott the elections. This would, of course, enable us to carry on with thepolicy of self-government and self-determination with the co-operation of the strongest Sudanese political party, and, I hope, of all but a minority of Sudanese.11. We do not in any case want to allow the Umma to get out of step with us, and thus give the Egyptians a fresh opportunity of exploiting our differences.Our trump card is our willingness to let the Sudanese have their independence;and the Egyptians will neglect no opportunity of exploiting any action on our part which seems to cast doubts on this. If relations with Egypt deteriorate to the point at Which the Agreement becomes unworkable, there is a good chance that we shallbe able to take the Sudanese with us in any measures which are necessary in theSudan. But it will be essential to persuade the Sudanese that our actions are intheir interests (they are only too ready to suspect our motives), and that responsi-bility for the breakdown of the Agreement (if it occurs) lies squarely on Egyptianshoulders.12. Meanwhile we are going ahead with our activities. The Trade Com-missioner&apos;s Office with its Information Section is now established in Khartoum.The question of re-opening the British Council depends on the provision of thenecessary funds. If we are to embark on a policy of co-operation with the Ummaparty we may also have to give them and the other independence parties somehelp. This will, of course, have to be kept secret.13. In considering the prospects in the Sudan, it is necessary to remember that 5 A.R. and his son are tricky customers, but I think that they genuinely want the independence of the Sudan.14. Finally, I am glad to be able to report that we seem to have dislodgedthe conviction in the minds of the Sudan Political Service that their role is to beneutral spectators of events.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,11th June, 1953.
