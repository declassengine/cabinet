I2J(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 195 COPY NC^8th JUDY, 1953.CABINETGENER/i.L AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADENO-NEW-PREFERSNCE RULEMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn C. (53) 172 I raised the question of securing a modification of the rule ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) which prohibitsCommonwealth countries from increasing margins of preference in their tradewith one another.   I explained that there would be considerable American and european opposition to an unconditional waiver of the No-New-Preference rule and that I saw no prospect of getting support in the G.A.T.T. unless we limited our request in some way.2. I suggested that we might make three qualifications to our request (thefirst of which was presentational and involved no concession of substance) viz:-(i) the waiver we were seeking would not apply to items on which theduties were for the time being &quot;bound&quot;;(ii) we would attach to the waiver a clause providing that, if waiver of the rule led in any particular case to a substantial diversion of trade from a foreign to a Commonwealth country, the foreign countryaffected would be entitled to seek authority in the G.A.T.T. to suspendequivalent concessions or obligations towards us;(iii) in the last resort we would offer to exclude from the waiver goods which were charged with duty under the Ottawa Agreements Act.I asked for authority to try to secure the support of the Americans for a waiver,if necessary with these three qualifications.3. The Economic Policy Committee considered this matter on 24th June(E.A.(53) 19th Meeting, Item 1), and authorised me to proceed on these lines,subject to my not offering to exclude the Ottawa duties from the waiver without reference to Cabinet.4. Cur Ambassador in Washington has now taken up this question with theUnited States Administration.   We have this morning heard from him that hesees no prospect whatever of our securing American support if we offer onlythe first two qualifications.   He thinks there would be a better chance ofsecuring this if we were able to offer the Ottawa concession and asks for authorityto offer it (Washington telegrams Nos. 1419 and 1420 attached).   I agree, and recommend that Cabinet should agree to the Ambassador&apos;s making a further attemptto secure American support by offering the Cttav/a concession.5. I would only add that I see the strongest objections to the State Department&apos;s
suggestion that we should continue quota protection for another year as analternative to making tariff adjustments.   The National Farmers&apos; Union havebeen told in confidence that we have decided in favour of a tariff increase andwould react extremely strongly to any suggestion that implementation of thetariff decisions should be deferred for a further year at least - not to mention the increasing pressure in the House from our backbenchers.   Moreover, thefact that we would be using quota restrictions against Europe primarily forprotective rather than for balance of payments reasons would attract increasingattention and would certainly have harmful repercussions on our export trade as a whole.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.7th July, 1953.&quot;WASHINGTON TELEGRAM NO. 1419Sir R. MakinsJuly 6, 1953.Your telegram No. 2155 Saving:   No-New-Preference Rule of G.A.T.T.For the reasons given in my letter of June 16 to Lee, I thought it essential, before taking this matter up with State Department myself, to ascertainprobable reactions to your latest proposal at the working level.   We have thereforediscussed it with State Department officials, (including Leddy).2. After a comprehensive and sympathetic discussion, it became clearbeyond question that State Department officials will not recommend acceptanceof your proposal in the form in which it now stands.   State Department feel that,even if United States Government were to support your proposal at Geneva, (andthey see no chance whatever of this at present), you would not get enough support from others to secure adoption of your waiver.   They consider that the best wecould hope for in September would be the establishment of a working party which would report back at the 1954 session.3. State Department feel that your latest proposals are, on the whole,less satisfactory than the ideas tentatively discussed between Lee and Leddyin March and April.   They consider that the safeguards which you have introduced to meet their difficulties are either axiomatic from the point of viewof other contracting parties, or were implicit in your original proposals whichthey could not regard as sufficiently qualified.   They emphasise that, if our proposals are to be made remotely acceptable to them, we must draft them insuch a way as to satisfy other contracting parties in advance that we shouldnot be taking action under the waiver which might prejudice the competitive position of most favoured nation suppliers in relation to Commonwealth suppliers.The possibility of ex post facto  compensation, or retaliatory action if a contracting party could show that it had suffered as a result of diversion oftrade, could,not, in their view, be regarded as an answer to the dangers implicit
in your waiver proposal.   The fact that the waiver was limited to &quot;unbound&quot; itemswas largely irrelevant as long as we could take steps to buy our way out ofparticular tariff obligations under Article XXVIII.   If our real objective was togive reasonable protection to a limited range of domestic industries withoutconferring uncovenanted benefits on Commonwealth preferential suppliers, thevery least we could do was to make it clear in so many words in the waiveritself that it should not apply in cases where material diversion of trade was likely to result.4. State Department did not dispute the force of the practical objections which you see to any waiver limited by reference to the percentage of Common-wealth trade in a given base year or years, but emphasised that if you felt obliged to proceed in this matter at the present time, there was probably no alternative to a waiver qualified in this way. -  (They did not promise supporteven on this basis, but implied that with this limitation we could probably count on &quot;sympathetic understanding&quot;. )5. These were the specific objections of State Department to your proposal.They emphasised, however, even more strongly than on previous occasions,that their main difficulty was more general.   In their view, your proposal,unless very drastically qualified, could   be represented as a major amendmentof the G.A.T.T.  They thought that an amendment of this importance should beconsidered only in the context of a general re-negotiation or re-affirmationof the G.A.T.T. which was likely to take place next year when the United states had completed the study of external economic policy for which president eisenhower had asked.   They hinted strongly that this would be the view taken at the highest levels in the United States Government when they were asked toconsider your proposal.6. In the meantime the State Department officials suggested that we should either continue quota protection for another year, (however undesirable this might be in principle), or go to the G.A.T.T. for specific waivers on those itemson which we had to act immediately, making it clear that we intended to press for a wider freedom in the form of a qualified general waiver next year, orwhenever the G.A.T.T. as a whole was under review.   See also my immediately following telegram.WASHINGTON TELEGRAM NO. 1420Sir R. MakinsJuly 6, 1953.My immediately preceding telegram:  No-New-Preference Rule.I am, as you know, of the opinion that this matter is not negotiable at a high level here without the support of the American officials at the working level, andit is clear from the sounding I have taken that this will not be forthcomingfor the proposals in your telegram No. 2155 Saving.2. I am, of course, prepared to ride for a fall with all the energy at mycommand.   But I wish to be quite sure that this is what Ministers want me to do.If, for example, I could be authorised to use th   concession mentioned in yourparagraph 5, there would certainly be a better chance of securing American supportor acquiescence for your policy, though I cannot, of course, guarantee success,especially as opinion here seems to have hardened slightly.3. Therefore, before I start off on the higher levels, I would ask that thequestion be looked at again with a view to giving me the latitude in your paragraph 5.For all practical purposes I can only take the horse once round the course here, andI would like to start with some prospect of finishing.-3-
