Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1953.SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 15920th May, 1953CABINETCANADIAN INTEREST-FREE LOANMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in 1942 the Canadian Government made to the United Kingdom an interest-free loan of $700 millions. In return the United Kingdom Government undertook that-(i) any sale or pledge of United Kingdom-owned Canadian securities to persons not resident in the United Kingdom should be subject to canadian Government consent;(ii) the proceeds of sales of United Kingdom-owned Canadian dollar securitiesand the proceeds of redemptions of United Kingdom-owned Canadiandollar or sterling securities should be applied to amortising the Loan.2. The Loan, which still carries no interest, has been reduced since 1942 bythe operation of the above provisions from $700 millions to under $200 millions.The amount of United Kingdom-owned dollar securities still subject to them isof the order of  600-700 millions or far in excess of the outstanding balance ofthe Loan.3. The effect of the 1942 provisions has been to prevent United Kingdomholders of Canadian securities from managing their portfolios to the best advantage.As a result we have been prevented from taking full advantage of the post-warprosperity of Canada, and have therefore almost certainly been forced to sacrificeopportunities for substantial increases in our dollar income from Canada.4. For several years we have been trying to persuade the Canadian Govern-ment to accept some alternative arrangement for the repayment of the Loan thatwould release us from this onerous control of our dollar investments. Up till now,however, the Canadian Government have never felt able to agree to a revision ofthe 1942 Agreement on terms that we could accept. They have made concessions,such as allowing us to offset against our liability any new direct investment inCanada, but they have maintained that they would find it politically impossibleto release us entirely from the control over the switching of our investments.5. During the last few weeks, however, my officials have been having further discussions with the Canadians as a result of which the Canadian Minister ofFinance, Mr. Abbott, has now secured the approval of the Canadian Cabinet tothe offer of a settlement under which (a) The United Kingdom would undertake (i) to reduce the total outstanding balance of the Loan from the present level of $196 millions to $150 millions by means of a lump sum payment;(ii) to amortise the Loan, thereafter, in 20 quarterly instalments of$7i?millions starting on 1st March, 1954;(b) Canada would undertake (i) to release us from the 1942 provisions regarding our Canadian invest-ments concurrently with the down-payment,(ii) to confirm that the Loan will remain free of interest until it is paid off;6. This settlement would mean that in return for the Canadian concessions,Her Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake a specific commitment to pay off the44240
Loan within 5 years in place of a commitment to apply in repayment all proceeds of realisation of United Kingdom-held Canadian securities. The comparative effectof these two methods of amortisation upon the rate of amortisation would depend of course on the rate of this process of realisation during the next 5 years but I do not believe that the method now proposed would mean any substantialacceleration. Under the settlement proposed we wotild commit ourselves to paying$49 millions in 1953 (including the lump sum payment) and $30 millions a yearduring the years 1954-58. During the last 10 years the average rate of redemptionhas been $50 millions a year. The rate has been substantially lower since we secured the &quot; offsetting &quot; concession referred to in paragraph 4 but we repaid $96 millions in the 3 years ended March 1953.7. In these circumstances I am satisfied that it is greatly in the national interestto set free our investors to make the best use of their skill in securing dollar income for the United Kingdom by accepting the proposed settlement.8. If my colleagues agree it will be necessary to consider the timing of theproposed down-payment. The Canadians would probably prefer it to be made assoon as possible but would not press us to make it before we are ready to do so.The earliest possible moment would certainly be my own recommendation if it werenot for possible repercussions in Washington. The Washington Embassy adviseus that a payment of this sort to Canada while the Administration^ case for defencesupport aid for the United Kingdom was still before Congress might be seized upon by those elements that are hostile to us as a reason for cutting our appropriation.They consider that we should delay the payment until this danger is past and I would accept their view.9.   I therefore recommend (a) that we should inform the Canadians that the settlement summarised inparagraph 5 is acceptable to us;(b) that I should be authorised to make the down-payment which is necessaryto give effect to that settlement when I am satisfied that it is unlikely to cause any serious repercussions on the amount of defence support aidwe are likely to obtain from the Americans.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,20th May, 1953.
