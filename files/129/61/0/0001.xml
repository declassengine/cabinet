SECRET      - &quot;      .   &apos;C.(53) 151 . COPY NO. 1 *oUTH MAY,. 1953 ,. CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND TRADE .Memorandum by the Minister of State -------. The paper by the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 137) puts forward a formidable case against our supporting in any way Japan&apos;s application to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).    I realise the difficultieswhich will be raised with some sections of industry, particularly in Lancashire, .difficulties which the Opposition will make the most of.    Nevertheless I think there are forcible arguments in favour of supporting Japan&apos;s entry.2.       A non-Communist -apan is most important to our position in the Far East.This means that Japan must be allowed to make her living in the free world, andhave fair access to markets.3.       Japan is now at a cross-roads; we want her to take the route of inter-national co-operation.    Her application to the G.A. T.T. is an example of her wishto move in the right direction.    To abstain from voting in the way suggested inparagraph 25 (iv) of the President&apos;s paper would have the foHwing consequences:-(a) We should be contradicting the basic principles of the collective approach to freer world trade.    Thiswould give ammunition to the protectionists in^the United States, and would present the hard-pressed Administration with an excuse for notmoving away from protectionism.(b) We should be going directly against our agreed policyof increasing trade between the sterling area and japan and of increasing Japan&apos;s confidence in,and use of, sterling.(c) We should prejudice good relations between GreatBritain and Japan and diminish our influence over Japan (see the attached telegram from. M. Ambassador in Tokyo).(d) We should add one more to our differences with theUnited States over the Far East.(e) We would give Japan an excuse for going back on herold malpractices.(f) We should be helping Communist propaganda in Asia,(g) In the G. A.T. T. itself, our attitude would causedisappointment and probably surprise.   although we are not committed, the Inter-SessionalCommittee&apos;s report was drafted very largely tomeet our difficulties.
4.        The Inter-Sessional Committee&apos;s solution does after all provide considerabl&apos;2protection.    It will allow us to take discriminatory action against Japan if we can make out a case for doing so, and in any event to take emergency action subject onlyto thirty days&apos; delay.    In addition, the protection already afforded by Article XIX,by which we can take emergency action on particular products, will still be there.5.        Even if we agree in principle that Japan may open tariff negotiations witha view to her eventual accession to the G. A. T. T. , there will be a delay of months,and perhaps years, before the negotiations are concluded.    We certainly need nothurry them; and we know that the United States are not likely to negotiate with Japanbefore mid-1954 at the earliest.6.       Therefore, in view in particular of the argument in paragraph 3(a) above,I feel there is a strong case for agreeing in principle to admit Japan to theG.A.T.T., subject to the conditions recommended by the Inter-Sessional Committee.Foreign Office, S. W. I.I1TH MAY, 1953.TELEGRAM FROM H.M. AMBASSADOR IN TOKYOSir E. DeningNo. 504 8th May, 1953Your telegram No. 571.The question of her accession.to the G.A. T, T. is one of outstandingimportance to Japan.    It has been a constantly recurring feature of the local press and was frequently raised with me during my recent tour of industrial areas.    TheJapanese Government and the country&apos;s industrial and financial leaders were wellpleased with the report of the Inter-Sessional Committee which they felt would ensure Japan&apos;s accession on non-discriminatory terms.2.       The effect on Japanese opinion, at both the official and non-official levels,of a decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to invoke Article XXXV would bedeplorable.    In my telegrams Nos. 110 of 30th January and 89 of 28th January, Iendeavoured to convey the strength of Japan&apos;s feelings on this matter and since then there has been no reason to modify the views I then expressed.3.       The proposals outlined in your telegram No. 576 seem to me to put japan on notice that we intend to do no more than to rest indefinitely on the provisions ofArticle 12 of the Peace Treaty.    If that is to be her expectation I can only say thatthe reaction would be profound.    It would be impossible to get away from the factthat by taking the action proposed we intend to single Japan out for discrimination and to persist in that discrimination.    This would destroy our influence with japan and convince her that she has nothing to gain by responding to our approaches when we require her co-operation, as for example in the case of Persian oil.4. It is for H. M. Ambassador, Washington, to say what American reactionswould be, but from the attitude of the American Embassy here I should judge thatthey would be considerable. My immediately following telegram contains text of announcement made by spokesman of State Department on 16th April, which I have
not seen in English press but which has received wide publicity here.    In mydespatch No. 58 of 24th March, on the future of Anglo-Japanese relations, I said &apos;that if we do not develop friendly relations with Japan we shall be in conflict withthe policy of the United States whose energies and resources are directed towardkeeping Japan in the Western camp.    I think that despatch is very relevant to theproposals which are now being made about the G.A. T,Ti    If we proceed with them should expect the United States to regard us as increasing her burden of aid to japan which is already very considerable.5.       I earnestly hope, therefore, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will not proceed against Japan as proposed for no-one will be in any doubt that it is against japan.&apos; .
