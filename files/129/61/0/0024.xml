Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 17415th June, 1953CABINETFOOD prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of food in the Budget Speech.provision for food subsidies in 1953-54 of  220 millions was announced. It now appears that unless corrective action is taken the subsidieswould amount in this financial year to approximately  229 millions. This takes account of the saving to be expected from the elimination of the sugar subsidy on derationing of sugar and, on the other hand, makes a modest allowance forincreased expenditure on wheat and flour bought outside the International wheat agreement.2. To ensure that the ceiling laid down in the Budget is not exceeded we propose the following increases in prices:  Current Increase EffectPrice Proposed on IndexCommodity                                per lb. per lb. PointButter         ............      3s. Od.            Ad. 0-24Margarine............      Is. Ad.            2d. 0-14Cooking fat (including lard)       ...      Is. 6d.            2d. 0-063. The increased prices proposed for margarine and cooking fat would yielda saving of some  7 millions and would also, by eliminating the subsidy at presentprocurement prices, prepare the way for the restoration of quality brands later in the year, a measure of decontrol to which we attach importance. The increasein the butter price would save an equal amount. The total effect would be tobring the subsidy forecast for this year down to  215 millions, which would providea modest margin to offset increases in the cost of food not at present foreseen.4. We propose to bring the increases into effect at the beginning of the nextrationing period on 12th July.R. A. B.15th June, 1953.44355
