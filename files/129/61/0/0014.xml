Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1953SECRET Copy No-    gC. (53) 1643rd June, 1953CABINETCOTTON: IMPORTING AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of MaterialsOur colleagues will remember that some weeks ago we brought to their .attention a difficult situation which appeared to be arising over the purchasingarrangements for cotton. Beginning with the 1952-53 buying season, the monopoly of cotton purchasing previously invested in the Raw cotton commission was modified to allow spinners to contract out and to buy cotton ontheir own account. There was some reason to believe that in the coming(1953-54) buying season this contf acting-out would be on a scale which might make it difficult for the Raw Cotton Commission to operate as at present, and,&quot;in particular, might make it difficult to provide the Lancashire cotton industry with the indispensable cover afforded by the Commission.2. On 19th February the Cabinet authorised us, provided we could reach agreement with the interests concerned on this course of action,(a) to announce that Government &quot; cover &quot; would be available to the cottonindustry in the 1953-54 buying season on terms broadly similar to,though not necessarily identical with, those provided this season bythe Raw Cotton Commission, and(b) to appoint a Review Committee to consider whether any change wouldbe desirable in the obligations and duties at present imposed on the raw Cotton Commission with respect in particular to the supply ofcotton and provision of cover to the United Kingdom cotton industry.(C.C. (53) 13th-Conclusion, Minute 6.)3. We were able to persuade the interests concerned including Trade unions to co-operate on a Review Committee, and we were fortunate in once more,securing the services of Sir Richard Hopkins as Chairman. We accordingly madethe announcement about cover in the 1953-54 buying season, and appointed the review Committee.4. The Review Committee has now submitted its report which is unanimous.The Committee proposes broadly a continuance for the next cotton buying season1953-54 of the arrangements which have prevailed in 1952-53. It recommends,however, some technical changes in the cover arrangements designed to limit therisk on public funds, while providing the whole industry with adequate cover.Moreover, to meet the possibility that the proportion of cotton which spinnerselect to buy privately in the 1953-54 season will increase substantially and; as aresult the Raw Cotton Commission may not be able to undertake with certaintyto provide individual spinners buying from it with the same service as now, theCommittee proposes that such spinners should be allowed, after consultation withthe Commission, to buy privately the whole or part of their requirements. TheCommittee is unanimous in the view that cover for private trade provided at therisk of public funds is undesirable and recommends that alternative ways ofproviding cover based on private funds should be examined urgently.44309
5. We are clear that as concerns arrangements for the 1953-54 buying seasonthe right course and indeed the only course really open to us will be for usto accept the Committee&apos;s conclusions and recommendations. We accordingly recommend that we should be authorised to publish the Report and announce, assoon as possible, the Governmenfs acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations for the 1953-54 buying season. If the necessary arrangements are to be made before the start of the next buying season, this announcement should be made on or before 16th June. There is, of course, great force in the Committee&apos;s unanimousview that after 1953-54 cover for private trade should not be provided at the riskof public funds. But this presents a difficult problem: it is not yet clear that itwill in fact be possible for the Government or the industry to devise arrangements,in respect of the 1953-54 buying season which will ensure that cover is provided from private sources or by means of a futures market. As is explained below, it is,therefore, necessary, in our view, that the Government should be cautious in itsendorsement of this particular recommendation.6. We should mention that the Annual Report and Accounts of the raw cotton Commission will shortly be published and laid before Parliament as requiredby the Cotton (Centralised Buying) Act, 1947. They will show that in the year ending July 1952 the Commission sustained a loss of some  27 millions which wasmet from available reserves. The Commission^ Report explains that this was largely a trading loss incurred on a falling market.7. We are fortunate once more in having obtained a unanimous Report fromthe Review Committee on this difficult and controversial subject, on the basis ofwhich arrangements acceptable to all of the interests concerned can be made forthe 1953-54 season. But these arrangements will not hold beyond the 1953-54buying season and although the Report is clear in its warning that alternative waysmust be sought of providing cover based on private funds thereafter, it offers noagreed basis for a solution to this problem. It is in fact doubtful whether there is asolution which would be acceptable to all of the interests concerned. Quite apartfrom the political controversy which may be involved, there are difficult technicalissues at stake, e.g., the question of whether a Liverpool futures market could operate effectively from 1953-54 or whether there would have to be some awkwardinterim &quot; twilight&quot; period. There is also the question of whether, if there has tobe such a period, the Raw Cotton Commission would have to continue in operation,and, if so, whether legislation would be required to validate what it does. All theseare matters which will require urgent but searching examination.8. We would propose, therefore, in announcing the Governmenfs acceptanceof the recommendations of the Review Committee to avoid any reference to Govern-ment policy beyond the end of the 1953-54 buying season. The question of pro-viding cover based on private funds after the end of the 1953-54 season will how-ever have to be tackled immediately and we propose to examine the various alternatives urgently in consultation with the several interests concerned. We shallformulate our proposals for September 1954 onwards in the light of these con-consultations. There is no time to lose in view of the highly controversial issues involved and we will consult our colleagues again as soon as possible.9. For the present we seek authority to publish the report of the CottonImport (Review) Committee and to announce at the same time that for the 1953-54cotton buying season the Government accepts its recommendations..
