Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1953SECRET Copy No..C. (53) 16227th May, 1953CABINETRELATIONS WITH PAKISTANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate this memorandum on relations with Pakistan for the informationof my colleagues.Background to Present Problems2. The new Pakistan Prime Minister, Mr. Mohammed Ali, and his colleagues(of whom the Minister for Food and Industries, Mr. Abdul Quayyum Khan isone of the most important) have assumed office at a moment of considerable political and economic difficulty. Pakistan, in less than six years, has largelysurmounted the many growing pains afflicting a new State set up in great hasteand with a lack of trained administrators and technicians which has not yet been overcome. She has been handicapped by the loss of her only two outstandingpolitical personalities, and by the initial bitterness and suspicion between Indiaand Pakistan, which was intensified by the communal massacres in 1947 and by various disputes with India, notably over Kashmir and the sharing of the waters,of the Indus Basin,  Nevertheless, Pakistan is now a going concern.3. She is faced by two fundamental, but to some extent inter-acting,decisions which will influence her future. In the first place, as an Islamic country,she has to decide whether she is to be a theocratic State in which the Mullahs,exercise great political influence or a secular State in which, as in Turkey, theIslamic religion is subordinated to democratic forms and modern practices.Secondly, though it has in recent months become increasingly probable that shewill decide to remain within the Commonwealth, she has still to make up her mindwhether to maintain, within the Commonwealth, her loyalty to the Crown or tobecome a Republic. It would, however, be wrong to suggest that the latter questionpresents itself in Pakistan as one of urgency, and public interest in it is reportedto be slight. The maintenance of the link with the Crown has no electoralappeal indeed the contrary.4. Meanwhile she cannot properly be regarded as a Parliamentary democracyon the British model. The present Constituent Assembly was indirectly electedpartly six and partly seven years ago, and there is no provision for its dissolutionuntil it has completed the task of framing the new Constitution, which is likely totake some time yet. It was presented, towards the end of December, by the basic principles Committee with a draft Constitution which could, with minor adapta-tions, be the basis of either a Crown or a republican system of Government. TheMullahs, who have been supporting the pro-republican elements, and had securedcertain constitutional powers for themselves in the draft Constitution, have receiveda serious set-back from the change of Government. Mr. Mohammed Ali and hiscolleagues are known to dislike the theocratic leanings of his predecessor, and hehas made it plain in conversation with our High Commissioner that his personal view is that the present form of association with the Commonwealth should be&quot;maintained.5. The new Prime Minister, though from our point of view a great improve-ment on his predecessor, and likely to show himself a more decisive and in someways more experienced personality, starts without any strong personal following44268
in political circles, and despite an initial personal success on a visit to his nativeEast Bengal it remains to be seen what political strength he will be able to exertin those quarters where fundamental decisions fall to be taken. His Governmentwill have to tackle de novo the unresolved questions whether Pakistan should bea theocratic or a secular State and in what relation she should stand to theCommonwealth.An Assessment of Pakistanis Future6. Pakistani approach to the principal problems of policy which face heris conditioned by (a) Her religious attachment to the Muslim countries of the Middle East andthe prestige to be gained by playing a leading role in the Muslim world.(b) Her fear of India and her consequent anxiety to acquire commonwealth and foreign support in her various disputes with India.(c) The anti-Colonialism typical of a non-European State, which has recentlyacquired nationhood.(d) Her immediate economic and financial weakness.Foreign Policy7. We may expect her foreign policy to waver between support for theWestern Powers against any threat from the Soviet Union, and support for theArab League and the anti-Colonial countries. Unless there is a marked detentein our relations with Soviet Russia we may hope that under Mr. Mohammed AllPakistan will attach more weight to support for the Western Powers than for theArab League. In any major clash with the Soviet Union we may expect Pakistanipolitical support, particularly in the United Nations. But we must recognise that public opinion in Pakistan is likely for as long as we can foresee to continue to giveviolent and irrational support for Islamic considerations.8. For this reason we cannot count on her support on any Middle eastern question unless our policies are generally acceptable to the Arab world. TheGovernment may sometimes make a special effort to meet our difficulties, but inthe ultimate analysis their policy is almost certain to be Islamic rather thanCommonwealth. Thus Pakistan will no doubt continue hostile to the western powers on issues such as Tunisia and Morocco, and if the Anglo-Egyptian disputewere to be brought up again in the United Nations we should probably findPakistan a supporter of the Egyptian case. Mr. Mohammed Ali is reported to have found it necessary to bow to public opinion to the extent of declaring himself asupporter of Egypt&apos;s &quot; territorial sovereignty.&quot;9. Pakistani relations with India have been and will remain the dominatingfactor in Pakistani external policy. It would lead to a notable strengthening ofthe Commonwealth and of the policy for the containment of communism if theserelations could be put on a normal, friendly footing. The proposed meeting between mr. Nehru and Mr. Mohammed Ali offers the best opportunity there has yet been of a gradual improvement of relations. If there is a breakdown, we must expectPakistan to intensify a policy, to which she has tended in the past, of seeking tosecure that any support which she gives to the Western Powers is repaid by support for her in all her disputes with India.Military Value10. Her military value is likely to be limited by these considerations. WesternPakistan occupies an important strategic position and her armed forces are keen,and, if fighting alongside our own forces, would be able to make a useful contribu-tion. At present, however, the amount of practical assistance she could give is limited by her disputes with India, her lack of experienced officers, her gravefinancial difficulties, and the fact that her reserves of man-power, though consider-able, are largely untrained. There seems reason to think that there is an element of anti-British feeling or at any rate indifference to the Commonwealth tie in boththe Navy and Air Force. Feeling in the Army however, particularly among the senior officers, is strongly pro-Commonwealth.11. All three armed services would require considerable supplies of defence equipment before they were ready for service overseas, and Pakistan would be-unlikely to be able to pay for them.   Even if the equipment could be supplied
to Pakistan we should still be uncertain whether she would commit her forces to service outside Pakistan, particularly if there were no immediate Soviet threat.The fact is that such defence equipment as we are already supplying to both Indiaand Pakistan is being deployed by them in the sub-continent against each other.12. Our assessment of the military assistance to be expected from Pakistan isthat for any purpose short of resistance to full scale Soviet aggression she would nothave forces available for service overseas until her disputes with India are settled.Even then her forces would probably not be available for service in the Middle Eastunless we had first reached a political settlement with Egypt and the Arab States.In the event of open war with the Soviet Union these considerations would probablyfade out and Pakistan would be likely to regard the defence of Persia and thePersian Gulf area as vital to her own security.Economic Position13. Pakistani present economic difficulties are relevant to the assessment of her future policy. When Pakistan was established, it was the general hope thatshe would be economically viable, especially as she was self-sufficient in food.This judgment is rather shaken by the events of 1952. With the end of the boombrought about by the Korean war, Pakistani external balance of payments took a sudden turn for the worse; owing in large part to the illness of ChaudhriMohamad Ali, the Finance Minister, and the ineffectiveness of his colleagues inthe Nazimuddin Government, corrective measures were only tardily introduced,and by the end of the year the reserves were in a very weak state indeed. To make matters worse, in 1952 it was found necessary to import wheat on a large scale and even greater quantities will be required in 1953-54 in order to avoid famine.14. Nevertheless a recent thorough examination of her prospects by officialshere has led to the conclusion that Pakistan could once more become self-supportingin food and possibly produce a small surplus for export, though probably not for at least two or three years. The new Pakistan Government is pursuing vigorouslya request to the United States Government for 1 million tons of wheat as a loanor grant. At the same time, Pakistan has asked for assistance from us in theform of a credit to be used for capital goods for her development programme, thegreater part of which is devoted to increasing her food production. negotiations are going on at present in Karachi, and we hope that agreement will shortly bereached under which not only will Pakistani balance of payments position be madeeasier, but also the United Kingdom will gain both the continuance of a valuablemarket and a measure of Pakistani goodwill.United Kingdom Policy15. We should neglect no opportunity to welcome and support the new PrimeMinister and should make it abundantly clear to him that we wish to see Pakistanboth politically and economically strong. We should continue to emphasise ourfriendship based on the long connection of two centuries; our esteem and regard for Pakistan; and our desire to help her as a member of the Commonwealth inall such ways as our resources and our general policy permit. It follows, however,from what has been said above that the individual problems should be approachedwith some caution.(i) The Constitutional ProblemBasically the line taken in Salisbury&apos;s paper C. (52) 425 remains appropriate.While we must do all we wisely can to encourage and strengthen Mr. MohammedAli&apos;s will to exert himself to maintain the present association with the Crown, wemust avoid giving any impression that we are running after Pakistan to prevent.her from becoming a Republic. We should appeal to her in her own interests notto forfeit the goodwill of other Commonwealth countries, in which the move toRepublicanism, at the present time and without the circumstances attending theIndian case, will be misunderstood. For Pakistan to be more anxious to equateherself with India than to preserve her alignment with her friends in the Common-wealth would be paradoxical.We must look narrowly at any tendency in Pakistan (such as showed itselfunder Mr. Nazimuddin and is implied by the draft Constitution in its present form) to seek, while maintaining the form of association with the Crown, to whittleaway the powers and the status of the Sovereign in a manner reminiscent of
Mr, de Valera&apos;s behaviour before the war. Moreover, unless all previous experience has ceased to be valid since Mr. Mohammed Ah&apos;s assumption of office, any impression left with him that we are anxious to dissuade Pakistan from becomingrepublican (or for that matter from leaving the Commonwealth) is likely only toencourage the Pakistanis to exact a price. Our High Commissioner considers thatwe should continue to leave her to make up her own mind; refrain from advice,comment or publicity as to her intentions; and in particular avoid suggesting thatwe attach such importance to retaining her in the Commonwealth, even as are public, that we are prepared to make any concession to secure it.(ii) Disputes with IndiaMr. Mohammed Ali in recent speeches has shown that he is aware of the urgent need for Pakistan and India to settle their various disputes, particularly thoseconcerning the accession of Kashmir and the use of the Indus basin waters. Mr.Nehru&apos;s response has been sympathetic. We should assure Mr. Mohammed Ali ofthe great importance which we attach to the establishment of good relations between india and Pakistan and to the development of close co-operation between themin the political, economic and defence fields:. We should give him every encourage-ment to seek a solution of these disputes in direct discussion with the Governmentof India, rather than through the United Nations,, emphasising that a settlement.cannot be imposed from outside and that the most Pakistan can hope for fromthe United Nations, apart from public discussion of the issues, is provision ofmachinery for mediation. This has not proved successful in bringing about asettlement over Kashmir, but a promise to bring pressure to bear on Mr. Nehruwould defeat the objective by making India in the end more hostile.(iii) Colonial PolicyIn view of the criticism of our colonial policy in the Pakistan press, and byPakistan spokesmen at the United Nations, we should do what we can in our conversations with Mr. Mohammed Ali to secure a better appreciation of our colonial policies, and to convince him that the real danger facing Pakistan, like therest of the free world, is the growth of Soviet power and the extension of Sovietdomination. The anti-colonial agitation in the United Nations gives great comfortto the Soviet Union, and makes more difficult the orderly development of self-governing institutions. We might express the hope that we can look to Pakistanfor understanding of our policy of helping the colonies to develop towards stable and viable self-government and bear in mind the dangers inherent in too rapid apace.(iv) Middle EastIn discussing the Middle East we should urge Mr. Mohammed Ali to counselmoderation upon the Arab countries and particularly Egypt. We should emphasisePakistani very real interest in strengthening this region against Soviet imperialism,We should leave it strictly to Pakistan to take the initiative in regard to association in Middle East defence. &apos; If Pakistan were to join in Middle East defence arrange-ments there would, in present circumstances, be a sharp deterioration of her relationswith India and we ourselves should seek to avoid responsibility for this. Our HighCommissioner recommends that we should leave it to Pakistan to apply for member-ship, and that we should avoid any suggestions of a quid pro quo in return.Recent Pakistan interest in the proposed Middle East Defence Organisation was largely due to the hope that membership would enable Pakistan to demandeconomic assurances and defence equipment which she is finding difficulty inaffording for defence against India,, and to the Indian press campaign which left the impression that, since India had something to lose, Pakistan must have some-thing to gain by membership of the organisation.SWINTON...
