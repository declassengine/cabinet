SECRETC455) 45 COPY NO. -4 g16th February, 1955CAB INE TLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn 28th July the Cabinet agreed to the insertion in tho programme for this Session of a Bill dealing with the Sugar Industry (C. C. (54) 55thConclusions, Minute 5), and a reference to it was made in The riuaen&apos;sSpeech.2.        The purpose of the Bill is, briefly, to end state trading insugar by the end of 1955, by providing alternative ways of carrying outthe Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, and of fulfilling our responsibilities to the home sugar beet growers.    A Sugar 3oard would be established,and the Bill would deal, among other things, with market sharing arrange-ments, refiners&apos; margins, etc.    One advantageous consequence of itsenactment would be to facilitate the re-opening of the London TerminalSugar Market.3.        The Bill has now been drafted and consists of some 36 Clauses(all very complicated) and three schedules, and will be a hybrid Bill.This means that over and above the ordinary stages through, the Mouse it also has to go to a Select Committee, to which petitions may be addressed,,It will, therefore, take a long time and will no doubt be very controversial;,4.        Government supporters may well think the new powers to be near&quot;nationalisation, and would have to be convinced that it is intended as a move towards freer trade in sugar; the Opposition will object to the end-ing of state trading, and to the quasi monopoly position of Tate and Lyle.5.        The Cabinet are therefore invited to consider what is the best course to adopt - to proceed with the 3ill this Session, or to drop it.6,        If we drop the Bill, we will not this year have seen the end ofstate tradiiag, and to that extent wiU not have gained one of our majorobjectives? and besides that there will be great disappointment in certaincircles at the postponement of the ra-opening of the London TerminalSugar Market,7.        If we proceed with the Bill it is hard to say that, given itslength and its hybrid form, and its controversial nature, it could been acted by the end of July.    Is it worth making the attempt?8.        If we decide to drop the Bill for this year, I would advise thatit be completely drafted and ready for introduction at the earliestpossible moment in the next Session.i        .       .,&quot; &apos; -&apos; &apos; --;&quot;vv - \ .        h.c.Gwydyr House, S.W.1, -16th February,1955.
