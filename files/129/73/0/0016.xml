IPrinted for the Cabinet. January 1955SECRET Copy No.C.(55) 1620th January, 1955CABINETDEPARTMENTAL RECORDSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in 1952; the Master of the Rolls and I appointed a committee under thechairmanship of Sir James Grigg to review, the arrangements for the preservation of the records of Government Departments in England: and Wales. The existing statutory provisions date mainly from 1877 and much has happened since then in the size and shape of Government Departments. Records from the earliesttimes already in the Public Record Office fill 40 miles of shelves. The processof creating fresh material goes on at an ever increasing rate. Only a proportionneed be kept, but mere bulk greatly complicates the process of deciding what should be preserved and what destroyed. Records in- Government Departments,not yet so transferred, but due for permanent preservation are estimated: to occupy120 miles of shelves.2.  The Grigg Report, published in July last (Cmd. 9163), recommended:(a) a first review of papers 5 years after they had passed out of active use all papers not then required for departmental purposes would be destroyed,(b) a second review after 25 years, at which all papers considered to be of nofurther administrative or historical importance should be destroyed.The significant proposal is that the test at the first review would be the simple one,whether the papers were still required for departmental purposes. TheCommittee, which included three historians and a University Librarian, weresatisfiedN that the loss of useful historical material would be less than under anyother system which would be practicable.3. Departments generally are in favour of the Committee&apos;s proposals,though one or two modifications of procedure are proposed. These should present no difficulty. I, therefore, ask my colleagues to agree to accept the general principle of reviews of records after 5 and 25 years, and of the destruction ofunwanted papers on the criteria recommended. The exact application of these principles would be settled by the Public Record Office with each Department.4. The Committee also recommended that the Public Record Office should normally be put in possession of records after 25 years. Some Departmentsconsider that certain records are best kept permanently in the Department.1 recommend central custody of records, except where the Public Record Officeand the Department agree to the contrary.5. The Committee recommended that as a general rule departmental recordsshould be open to public inspection after 50 years. This is linked with the date by which Cabinet records should be made available. The Secretary to the cabinet has already circulated a memorandum on this (C. (54) 265). There should beno difficulty about opening ordinary departmental records to public inspectionafter 50 years, subject to a right in Departments to deny access to certain recordsfor a longer period; but there will be some references to Cabinet papers and decisions on departmental files, so that a decision on this point is linked with thedecision about access to Cabinet records.47516
26. In order to facilitate closer co-ordination of policy and practice betweenthe Public Record Office and Departments, the Committee recommended that thePublic Record Office should be responsible to a Minister of the Crown insteadof to the Master of the Rolls. I have discussed this with the Master of the Rolls$ Ka and some of my colleagues, and subsequently with the Prime Minister, who hasdecided that the Lord Chancellor should be the responsible Minister. in announcing our decision we should pay tribute to the valuable work that has beendone in this field by successive Masters of the Rolls. The present Master of the rolls, although burdened with increasingly heavy judicial duties, has never sparedhimself in supervising the work of the Public Record Office.7. The Grigg Committee recommended some strengthening of the PublicRecord Office and of the staffs concerned with records in the Departments. I have in mind to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations and they will be put intoeffect as opportunity permits. Special arrangements may have to be made toenable Departments to overtake accumulated arrears of records.8.   I therefore recommend that we should (i) accept the proposals made by the Grigg Committee, subject to the minor modifications indicated above;(ii) announce our acceptance of them;(iii) in due course introduce legislation to give effect to those measures which involve amendment of the Public Record Office Acts.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,19th January, 1955.
