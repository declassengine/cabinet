introduction in view of the gravity of the constitutional issues involved in the case ofHarper v. The Secretary of State for the Home Department, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to publish the record of the proceedings in theCourt of Appeal on Monday. 20th December. 1954. These proceedings were an appeal by the Secretary of State from a decision of Mr. JusticeRoxburgh, who. on Friday, 17th December, granted the plaintiffs an interiminjunction restraining the Secretary of State from submitting to Her majesty in Council the draft Parliamentary Constituencies (Manchester, Oldham andAshton-under-Lyne) Order. 1954. The appeal was allowed and the injunctiondischarged.2. The Order, one of a number giving effect to the recommendations ofthe Boundary Commission for England! had been laid before Parliamentunder the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949.Section 3 (4) of which provides that if any such draft Order is approvedby resolution of each House of Parliament, the Secretary of State shallsubmit it to Her Majesty in Council. The Order was approved by resolution of the House of Lords on the 16th December and by resolution of theHouse of Commons in the course of its sitting on the same day.3. On an ex pane application on the following day Mr. Justice Roxburghheld that the plaintiffs had established a ptima facie case that the boundary commission had not complied with the Rules laid down by the Act and hegranted an injunction restraining the Secretary of State from submitting thedraft Order to Her Majesty in Council under this provision. .4. The Court of Appeal held that there was no ground for saying thatthe Boundary Commission had departed from the Rules prescribed in theAct. The Court did not therefore find it necessary to express any view uponthe.argument submitted to it that the Courts have no power to grant suchan injunction.5. The view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is that the Courts have nojurisdiction either to interfere with a legislative process laid down by practiceor statute or to restrict the access to Her Majesty of a Minister of the Crown.In expressing this view Her Majesty&apos;s Government trust that they havethe support of all Members of Parliament.4th January. 1955.47418

PART IThe Attorney-General: May it please your Lordships, my learnedfriends. Sir Andrew Clark, Mr. Nesbitt and Mr. McEwen, appear for mr. Richard Stephenson Harper and Mr. Forrester Lord, and 1 appearwith my learned friend Mr. Warren for the Secretary of State for the home department. I desire leave to move the Court with short notice of motion for an Order that the interim injunction granted by Mr. Justice Roxburghon Friday last restraining the Secretary of State for the Home Departmentfrom submitting a draft Order-in-Council entitled the Draft ParliamentaryConstituencies (Manchester, Oldham and Ashton-under-Lyne) Order, 1954,to Her Majesty in Council for approval be discharged.I would like your Lordships first of all to glance at the last page of theShorthand Note of the Judgment, because I think I should first satisfy your lordships that the matter comes properly before this Court. The applicationbefore Mr. Justice Roxburgh was ex parte, but after the learned Judge had announced that he would grant this interim injunction, Mr. Warren, who wasappearing with my learned friend Mr. Solicitor-General who was there atone time, said, as your Lordships will see on page 9 : &quot; Might I make anapplication to your Lordship? I have been silent up to now. (Mr. JusticeRoxburgh): Strictly, you are not before the Court. I will hear what yourapplication is. (Mr. Warren): I am instructed that the Attorney-general would wish to move to discharge the ex parte injunction which your Lordshiphas just granted before Tuesday, to which date the injunction runs. Iapprehend that in ordinary circumstances the Attorney-General might have moved your Lordship on Monday. Your Lordship has already stated the inconvenience of any proceedings of this nature before your Lordship onMonday. (Mr. Justice Roxburgh): I am addressing you without prejudicebecause you are strictly not before the Court but 1 am prepared to listen toyou. Is your right course not to go to the Court of Appeal? I do not know;I reserve that until the matter comes on. I should have thought that theCourt of Appeal existed to put a Judge right if he has made a mistake.Indeed, sometimes, in a case like this, I may say I am glad there is a Courtof Appeal. (Mr. Warren): I am not certain that it would not be the properprocess to apply to your Lordship to discharge the ex parte injunction andthen, if your Lordship turns the Attorney-General down on that point, to goto the Court of Appeal. (Mr. Justice Roxburgh): I am not going to be involved in nonsensical procedures. If you have to come to me to discharge the Order that is one thing, but the next motion day in any Court, as far asI know, is Tuesday, and of course on Tuesday the Order will be, so far asI am concerned, wholly reconsidered. That is always so with an ex parteinjunction and I shall on Tuesday, if the matter comes back to me, as it were,start afresh. I am not at all clear that between now and that date you can come to me to discharge the Order. I am certain that you can go to&apos; theCourt of Appeal and see what happens there.&quot;Lord Justice Jenkins: If an Order is made against somebody ex parteand it is to their detriment. I should have thought prima facie it would go atonce to the Judge who made the Order, and they would ask that it be discharged.The Attorney-General: I think the implication from this is that thelearned Judge was not prepared to discharge this Order.The Master of the Rolls: It looks as though he would have regarded thatas a nonsensical procedure, though I must not be taken to assent.
^5, The Attorney-General: The implication that I am asking your Lordshipto read into this is that Mr. Warren was intimating that he desired that theinjunction. should be discharged, and the learned Judge had said that hewould not hear such a motion until Tuesday.. In.those circumstances, in mysubmission, as this is, as I shall shortly indicate, a matter of great urgency,the only course open to us is to come straight to your Lordships, and as Ishall show your Lordships, under the Judicature Act we can come on amatter like this without the leave of the learned Judge.The Master of the Rolls: I have an idea that we had a somewhat similarcase where an ex parte injunction was granted against the Musicians&apos; Union,and the Union came here. I do not know what view Sir Andrew will take,but in the ordinary course and assuming time is not a matter of very greatimportance, I should have thought the course would be to move to discharge the Order and you would not have to wait until the next motion day. Thenif the Judge says No, you come here.; The Attorney-General: Tf I might just finish this before making thecomment, in my submission the implication from what Mr. Justice Roxburghsaid on last Friday evening was that he was not prepared to grant any facilities for such a motion.The Master of the Rolls: I agree that is what it looks like.The Attorney-General: If I may read on, the learned Judge said:&quot; I am certain that you can go to the Court of Appeal and see what happensthere. I cannot tell you. So far as I am concerned, I am not going togive any facilities to discharge this Order before Tuesday, because I havenot got the time to give. It seems to me that if you want to make anapplication there is the Court of Appeal &quot;; so the learned Judge was saying :&quot; If you come back to me on Monday I am not going to hear you.&quot; Inthose circumstances, in my submission, this Court would be entitled to treatwhat the learned Judge said on Friday last as really refusing the motion fordischarge, which I respectfully agree ought technically, if time permitted,always to be made. In my submission, your Lordships can treat this as a motion for discharge which was rejected by the learned Judge.. The Judicature Act, 1925, makes provision for an appeal from the learnedJudge&apos;s decision. It is also in the Annual Practice at pages 1235 and 1236.At the foot of page 1235 your Lordships see: &quot;Appeals with Leave only.In the following cases appeal lies to the Court of Appeal only if leave to appeal.is obtained &quot; and then one turns to Paragraph 2 on the next page :&quot;From any interlocutory order or interlocutory judgment made or givenby a Judge .... except in the following cases &quot;, and it is an exception to the Rule that leave is required &quot;Where an injunction or the appointmentof a receiver is granted or refused.&quot;I think it appears even more clearly from the terms of the Judicature Actitself, Section 31(1); which says: &quot;No appeal shall lie . ... (i) withoutthe leave of the Judge or the Court of Appeal or any interlocutory orderorany interlocutory judgment made or given by a- Judge,,except in. thefollowing cases namely &quot; - and the second case-&quot; where, an injunction orthe appointment of a: receiver is granted or refused.&quot;In my submission, I am properly here; and indeed I am here at thefirst-possible opportunity on this matter, which is of considerable urgency and importance.    \h.       i/r. , &apos; -The Master of the Rolls: You say an injunction is granted against the defendant who was in fact, there although it was ex parte. That does notlimit the Defendants right to appeal; though, in the ordinary case it: might
\be that if the preferred procedure had been used to discharge it; whether that procedure should be adopted is a matter for the circumstances of thecase, and there you have got an intimation from the learned Judge thathe would not be disposed to discharge it, and in any case would not dealwith it until a date which you say is&apos; too late to be useful to you. That&apos; is what it comes to?The Attorney-General: Yes, I do say that. If the views expressed byMr. Justice Roxburgh are well founded, it may mean, first of all, that none of the draft Orders in relation to constituencies already approved by bothHouses of Parliament can properly be submitted to Her Majesty in Council.It may mean that the Houses of Parliament could not properly considerthe remaining draft Orders laid before them. Mr. Justice Roxburgh&apos;decision, if correct, would appear to affect every recommendation of the boundary, Commission for England. So far as London is concerned, and itmay be, I am not sure, also so far as other boroughs are concerned, time is of very great importance, because following upon the change of the Parliamentaryconstituency boundaries changes have to be made in the local governmentconstituency boundaries; the local government elections will take place nextMarch, and there has to be a great deal done with regard to the arrangementsfor those elections before that date comes.The Master of the Rolls : Have you anything more you want to say on theprocedural point, because I think it would be right for me to ask Sir Andrewwhat he says about it?The Attorney-General: No, 1 do not think there is anything more,My Lord.The Master of the Rolls: I should have thought on a matter of urgency,though I will hear what is said, prima facie if the Secretary of State says itis very urgent to get this matter dealt with, if possible to-day, the court would accept that.The Attorney-General: I would say this on the urgency matter. TheCourt will be rising, as indeed will be the House of Commons, in a very short space of time. If the views of Mr. Justice Roxburgh are not upsetand the injunction continues, it might mean that the draft Orders couldnot properly be considered by the House of Commons before the recess,which in turn would mean that they could not be considered until theHouse meets again towards the end of January, which would delay thewhole process of implementation of those draft Orders. That is all I desireto say on the matter of urgency.The Master of the Rolls: Sir Andrew, in view of what has been said, weall feel prima facie that we have jurisdiction to hear, and ought to hear, the appeal,;but of course we would not decide that if you contest it until wehave heard you. -  &apos;- Sir Andrew Clark : May I put the position to your Lordships? It is thisJIn my submission your Lordships have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against an ex parte injunction. Your Lordships have got jurisdiction to hearan appeal from a refusal to&apos;rescind an expqrte injunction.&apos; . The Master of the Rolls : It is almost the same thing. If the Judge says:&quot;I cannot hear it on Monday, and what is more, will not,&quot; and furthersuggests that an application to discharge it is a-nonsensical procedure -------Sir Andrew Clark: With respect, in fairness to his Lordship, I do-notthink his Lordship was referring to that as-the nonsensical procedure.   There
was a good deal of difficulty, because no appearance had been entered bythe Secretary of State, and Mr. Solicitor-General said he was not willing togive an undertaking to enter an appearance. Therefore, it was difficult.There was really nobody before his Lordship, and it was to that that hisLordship was referring, because his Lordship goes on and says : &quot; If you have to come to me to discharge the Order that is one thing.&quot; That is notwhat he was considering as the nonsensical procedure. Your Lordships maywell take the view that this paragraph amounts to a refusal to discharge theOrder.The Master of the Rolls: I do not want you to think I am being impoliteto the Judge: I did not mean to criticise him. What I understood that to mean was, that merely to go through the rigmarole of hearing a formalapplication to discharge would waste time.Sir Andrew Clark : I have difficulty in thinking that his Lordship reallymeant that, because his Lordship had not heard any argument from the solicitor-General. He had only heard one side of the motion, so to speak.What is before your Lordships at the moment is not the motion. The motioncomes on on Tuesday. The only question before your Lordships is whether there should be an ex parte injunction before Tuesday when the motioncomes on. There can be no appeal on the motion, which has not been heardat all. This was merely an ex parte application of mine for leave to servenotice of motion with the writ, and an ex parte injunction was granted onthat. Then his Lordship directed that I should serve short notice of motion for 2 o&apos;clock so as to afford Mr. Solicitor-General or Mr. Attorney anopportunity of being present. Mr. Solicitor-General was there. He had notentered an appearance, and he did outline an objection to the jurisdiction,but said he was not in a position to argue the motion, and did not want to argue the motion, that the motion could not be heard and that he was not fully instructed, so the motion was never heard before Mr. Justice Roxburgh,and there has been no argument on the motion. His Lordship has heardmy opening on the motion, on which he said it was a case to be tried, andthat in view of the Act, which provides that once the assent of Her majesty is granted to the Order in Council it cannot be challenged in any Court, sothat if the Order in Council went before Her Majesty before the motionwas heard on Tuesday, whatever the wrongs or rights or the merits of mycase, I was out of Court for all time, and there was an end of the matter.His Lordship asked Mr. Solicitor-General if be would make a statement orgive an undertaking that pending the hearing of the motion on Tuesday theOrder in Council would not be presented. Mr. Solicitor-General said he couldnot do that, and was not prepared to do that, and was not prepared to arguethe motion. Then his Lordship said: &quot; I will continue with the ex parteapplication &quot;and see whether I shall grant an ex parte injunction.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: The matter before us is the ex parte injunction.Sir Andrew Clark : Yes, and only the ex parte injunction.The Master of the Rolls: It was the learned Judge&apos;s intimation thathe was unable to hear any application in regard to it to-day.Sir Andrew Clark: Yes.The Master of the Rolls: That being so, unless the Defendant is. withoutremedy altogether,.he must be entitled to come here, must he not?Sir Andrew Clark : If that amounts to a refusal to hear, which perhapsyour Lordship may feel it does, yes., it would be so.
The Master of the Rolls: I say refusal; again, I do not want to be impoliteto the Judge: a statement that he would be unable to hear it.Sir Andrew Clark: I do not want to take a technical point in this case.If your Lordships feel that your Lordships have jurisdiction I shall not proceed in some purely technical obstructive matter, but I am bound to put the point to your Lordships.The Master of the Rolls: Non constat we should take a different viewfrom that entertained by the Judge.Sir Andrew Clark: No. I stress to your Lordship that it is not a case where your Lordships should go into the whole motion and. try the motion.The only question before your Lordships is whether the status quo should be preserved until Tuesday.  The motion has not been heard.Lord Justice Jenkins: Strictly speaking, a speedy trial to take place before Tuesday ought to be directed, because unless you succeed there willbe nothing left in the action.Sir Andrew Clark : It may be that until the case has been fully argued inthe Court of first instance, it is difficult to argue it.The Master of the Rolls: Supposing we came to the conclusion that we ought not to interfere with the learned Judge, that is easy. If, on the otherhand, we came to the conclusion that we ought to interfere,&apos; but that the matter would come in the ordinary way before the Judge to-morrow, unless the motion were heard and dealt with with the most extraordinary despatch, bythe time the Order has been made by the Judge it is too late. The suggestion was that the Secretary of State would present the draft Orders to Her majesty in Privy Council to-morrow morning.Sir Andrew Clark : Yes, my Lord.The Master of the Rolls: That would cut your argument very shortindeed; it would have been done by the time you had finished.Sir Andrew Clark: Yes, my Lord, and that is why his Lordship grantedan ex parte injunction, because there was no undertaking not to do that. Onthe question of urgency, it is said that Parliament would not have time toconsider these Orders, but your Lordships will see there is no question ofParliament considering the Orders again; they have been considered byParliament, and they are either rejected or not.The Attorney-General: That is referring to other Orders still before theHouse.Sir Andrew Clark: If your Lordships feel your Lordships have jurisdic-tion I do not wish to press any purely technical point which would,causeunnecessary delay and difficulty.The Master of the Rolls : Mr. Attorney, what occurs to us is this, that SirAndrew is right, that all we are concerned with is the ex parte injunction, andwe can only make an Order on that.The Attorney-General: Yes.The Master of the Rolls: If one may rely upon what one reads in thePress, the learned Judge was moved to grant that injunction by the view he took of an Act of Parliament.The Attorney-General: Yes..ft
The Master of the Rolls: No doubt you will say that was an erroneousview, and if we thought it was and said so it might have, from your point ofview, excellent results, but we must not lose sight of the fact when weconsider matters of discretion and so on, that we are only dealing with an ex parte injunction.The Attorney-General: Your Lordships are dealing with an ex parteinjunction, and my submission is that his Lordship had no jurisdictionwhatsoever to grant it.The Master of the Rolls : You attack it in limine.The Attorney-General: Yes, I attack it in limine, and I attack it all along the line as well, because even if he thought there was an error on the part ofthe Boundary Commission, it still remains a report of the boundary commission, and there was no ground whatsoever, as is easily demonstrable,for saying that that report was ultra vires, and as I shall show your lordships, the Statute itself is mandatory so far as the Home Secretary isconcerned: once the draft Order is approved by resolution of the House ofCommons it is a mandatory obligation on him, and he has no discretion inthe matter at all.The Master of the Rolls: Even though the Commissioners havedemonstrably erred and there appears a report on the face of it containing a distortion of their powers?The Attorney-General: So long as it is a report of the boundary commission (which it clearly was) and the draft Order is laid, as it can be,with or without modification of their recommendation, the Statute providesthat once there is approval by resolution of the House the Secretary of state shall submit the Order to Her Majesty in Council. The injunction grantedat my learned friend&apos;s instance ex parte, is an injunction enjoining theSecretary of State for the Home Department to refrain from doing something which he is under a statutory duty to do, and in relation to which once theapproval of the House is given he has no discretion whatsoever. In those circumstances, in my submission, once one comes to this Court and inmy submission one properly comes to this Court, having regard to the time factor I am entitled to ask your Lordships to discharge an ex parteinjunction which ought, in my submission, never to have been made.The motion was on behalf of two gentlemen, Mr. Harper and Mr. Lordwho are at the moment electors of the Gorton Division of Manchester, andunder the draft preliminary Order their right of voting will be transferredto voting in the new Openshaw Division. No question of loss of franchisearises; the only effect of the Order is to change the constituency in which theycan exercise that right of franchise. If I may outline my submissions, i submit first of all that Mr. Justice Roxburgh had no jurisdiction to grantsuch an injunction against the Secretary of State for the Home Department:1. submit that the High Court has no power to restrain a Minister of theCrown.from submitting a document-to Her Majesty for Her Majesty&apos;approval in Council, just as it has no power to grant an Order of Mandamusdirecting a Minister of the Crown to give Her Majesty certain advice inCouncil. After a Bill has received its third Reading it has, of course, to besubmitted to Her Majesty for the Royal Assent. In relation to theprocedure under this Act of 1949, neither House considers a Bill. Theyhave under that Act to approve the draft Order-in-Council, which has then,if approved, to be submitted to Her Majesty in Council. So your Lordshipssee that the procedure in substance is the same as in relation to a Bill.   A
tBill when it has passed both Houses expresses the view of both Houses as towhat should be made legislation. It requires the Royal Assent. The draftOrders when approved by each House of Parliament contain what each house has expressed to be its desire to see made law. It does become lawwhen it receives the Royal Assent in Council, just as a Bill becomes an ActoT Parliament when it receives the Royal Assent. Just as, in my submission,it is inconceivable that after a Bill has passed its third Reading a Court hasjurisdiction to prevent the Bill being submitted for the Royal As&quot;sent at the instance of two individuals, so is it equally inconceivable that after a draft order has been approved by resolution of each House of Commons a Courtcan intervene and by injunction prevent that draft Order in Council soapproved from being submitted to Her Majesty as the Act requires. ,Secondly, in my submission, the Crown Proceedings Act, 1949, does; not contain any power which enables my teamed friend to obtain properly suchan injunction, ex parte or otherwise. Thirdly, even if the Court hadjurisdiction to grant such an injunction, in my submission there was no groundwhatsover for doing so. As your Lordships will see, the learned Judgeappears to have based his decision on the view that the report of the boundary commission contained an error, a departure by the Boundary commission from the requirements imposed upon them by the Act. Having, as he thought,detected an error, the learned Judge proceeded to treat this report of the boundary Commission as if it had ceased to be a report of the boundary commission. In my submission, there was no error on the part of the boundary Commission, and their report does not reveal any indication thatthey departed from the rules which they were required to observe.Lord Justice Jenkins: Supposing it was arguable that they had, a queersituation would arise, because you might get both Houses of Parliamentreconsidering the thing and saying in their view it was a perfectly good draft order complying with the report, and you might get the Court saying itis not.   That is a queer situation.The Attorney-General: It is, and particularly queer when both the Houseof Commons and the House of Lords have to approve it, and when the matter might go on appeal to the House of Lords which has already approved theOrder. To conclude outlining my submissions, even if the report did onthe face of it contain an error, in my submission it did not cease to be thereport of the Boundary Commission submitted under the Act, which Actrequired them to submit reports from time to time.With those preliminary observations, perhaps it would be convenient to look straight away at the relevant Statute, the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, Volume 2. I will, if I may, turn first to Section 1 (1): &quot;For the purpose of the continuous review of the distributionof seats at parliamentary elections, there shall be four permanent boundary commissions, namely, a Boundary Commission for England, a boundary commission for Scotland, a Boundary Commission &quot;for Wales&apos; and aBoundary Commission for Northern Ireland.&quot; Then Section 2 (!) says:&quot; Each Boundary Commission shall keep Under review the representation in the House of Commons of the part of the United Kingdom with whichthey are concerned and shall, in accordance with the next followingSubsection, submit to the Secretary of State reports with respect to thewhole of that part of the United Kingdom, either-(a) showing the constituencies into which they recommend that it should be divided in orderto give effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule to this Act; or(ft) stating that, in the opinion of the Commission, no alteration is requiredto be made in respect of that part of the United Kingdom in order to giveeffect to the said rules.&quot;
&apos; &quot;2,I.think I can turn straight on to Subsection (5) of that Section, whichis&apos; an important Subsection: &quot;As soon as may be after a boundary commission have submitted a report to the Secretary of State under thisAct, he shall lay the report before Parliament together, except in a case where the report states that no alteration is required to be made in respectof the part of the United Kingdom with which the Commission are concerned,with the draft of an Order in Council for giving effect, whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations contained in the report.&apos;&apos;So your Lordships see that the Boundary Commission from time to time will submit under Section 2 (1) reports to the Secretary of State. It then becomes a duty on the Secretary of State to lay them, and if one considers the earlierwords of Subsection (5), emphasis was placed by the learned Judge onthe words at the beginning of that Section: &quot;report under this Act,&quot; but thewords &quot; under this Act&quot; relate back to the verb &quot; submitted.&quot; TheSubsection says: &quot; As soon as may be after a Boundary Commission have submitted a report to the Secretary of State under this Act. . . .&quot; Once itis laid, the Secretary of State has to lay with it the draft Order, whetherwith or without modifications, to the recommendations contained in thereport.Section 3 (2) is in these terms: &quot; The draft of any Order in Council laidbefore Parliament by the Secretary of State under this Act for giving effect,whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations containedin the report of a Boundary Commission may make provision (a) for any matters which appear to him to be incidental thereto or consequentialthereon,&quot; and I do not think sub-paragraph (b) is material.Then Subsection (4), which is an important Subsection, says: &quot; If anysuch draft is approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, theSecretary of State shall submit it to His Majesty in Council.&quot; Your Lordshipswill see that the ex parte injunction granted here restrains the Secretary ofState from doing the very thing that Subsection (4), which is mandatory,requires him to do. So the Secretary of State is now faced with the dilemmathat either he acts in contempt of Court in breach of the injunction granted by Mr. Justice Roxburgh, or he fails to carry out the duty imposed upon himby this Act.The Master of the Rolls: Subject to this:  it does not say when he hasto do it.The Attorney-General: No, but it says he shall. He has no discretion in the matter; he has to do it some time. The fact that he has nodiscretion is important, because my learned friend sought to argue before mr. lustice Roxburgh that the Home Secretary, once the Order was approvedby the House of Commons, had as my learned friend said, &quot; the ball athis feet,&quot; implying that the Home Secretary could kick it in any direction.In my submission that is utterly inaccurate. There is only one thing thatthe Home Secretary can do when the Order is approved, and that is tosubmit it to Her Majesty. It will then be for Her Majesty in Council todecide whether or not the Order should be made of legislative effect. As i submit, the Home Secretary has no discretion in the matter at all at that stage.Subsection (5) says: &quot;If a motion for the approval of any such draft is rejected by either House of Parliament or withdrawn by leave of the House,the Secretary of State may amend the draft and lay the amended draft beforeParliament, and if the draft as so amended is approved by resolution of each house of Parliament, the Secretary of State shall submit it to His majesty in Council.&quot; The next Subsection to which I ought to draw your Lordships&apos;attention is Subsection (6): &quot;Where the draft of an Order in Council is
submitted to His Majesty in Council under this Act, His Majesty in council may make an Order in terms of the draft which shall come into force on such date as may be specified therein and shall have effect notwithstandinganything in any enactment.&quot; Then there is provision about any parliamentary election which has taken place during the present Parliament. Subsection (7)is: &quot; The validity of any Order in Council purporting to be made under thisAct and reciting that a draft thereof has been approved by resolution of each house of Parliament shall not be called in question in any legal proceedingswhatsoever,&quot; so it is perfectly true to say that once the Order in Council ismade it cannot be challenged. On this particular provision my learned friendsought to found an argument that from this express provision it is to beimplied that the Courts have jurisdiction to interfere before the Order is made.I would submit that until the Order is made the position of these two electorsremains unaltered, and, as I have just submitted to your Lordships, her majesty in Council may decide to make the Order or may decide that theOrder should not be made. The effect of the injunction directed to the HomeSecretary at the present time is, in my submission, similar to an injunction to stop proceedings being brought before a Court at which a decision on ajusticiable issue may be reached.The Master of the Rolls: How far do you go? To the eye at first sight,the question whether two gentlemen should cast their votes in oneconstituency rather than another does not seem important, though 1 wellbelieve there is much more in it than meets the eye at first sight. But if therewere some statute whereby under an Order in Council made following areport somebody&apos;s property was going to be taken away under the franchiseand it was made apparent that the House of Commons and the House ofLords had been misled by something in a report, do you say the Courts wouldhave no jurisdiction to protect the citizen from what would be then anirretrievable step depriving him of his rights?The Attorney-General: They might, as I shall indicate to your Lordship,have power to intervene before the approval of both Houses. Under a statutesuch as this where the approval of both Houses has to be followed bysubmission to Her Majesty, there is in my submission no right to interveneonce the approval of both Houses has been obtained.The Master of the Rolls: So on those facts the citizen would be withoutremedy in Court?The Attorney-General: If it appears that before the boundary commission reported and I shall show your Lordships a case on this theywere proceeding on the wrong line, as it might appear in an inquiry whichthe Boundary Commission had ordered to be held, then it might be that theCourts would be able to issue a Writ, of Prohibition to prevent the boundary commission proceeding along the wrong lines. Where a report has come before Parliament it is for Parliament, in my submission, to consider those matters. If having had the report before Parliament, no Writ of Prohibitionhaving been issued before then, approval to the resolution is given, after that,in my submission the Courts cannot interfere, just as in my submission theycannot interfere after a Bill has passed its third Reading in both Houses andawaits the Royal Assent. It is too late. The Courts cannot then say: &quot;TheBill having expressed the intention of both Houses as to what they wanted to be put into legislation the Court can interfere.&quot; After that it cannot besaid here that the draft Order also containing what the Houses of Parliamentwish to see embodied in legislation could be stopped from being submitted toHer Majesty.
23-The point T was trying to make was that, although this injunctionin terms is an injunction to restrain the Home Secretary, it is an injunctionto restrain him from doing something, namely, submitting the draft to her majesty so as to prevent Her Majesty in Council from considering whetheror not to make the Order. Consequently, although this injunction is interms directed to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, it is infact directed to the Crown.. . There is one other matter about which I ought to inform your Lordshipsbefore I come back to the Statute. On Tuesday, the 14th December, theMayorj Aldermen and Councillors of Hammersmith and Fulham asked mr. Justice Harman to order the Boundary Commission to intimate to theHome Secretary that their report was a nullity. As I shall show your lordships, Mr. Justice Harman said in his Judgment upon that motion thatit did not seem to him that;it was for the Courts at all to interfere byinjunction, advice or declaration, or in any other way, with the recommenda-tions of the Boundary Commission. In my submission, Mr. Justice Harman&apos;judgment on that point was entirely right. I shall refer your Lordshipsto his Judgment later. It was mentioned to Mr. Justice Roxburgh but not considered by him, or indeed read to him.May I come back to the Act once more and to the First Schedule ofthe Act? Your Lordships will see there that the constitution of the boundary commission is dealt with: &quot;1. The Speaker of the House of Commonsshall be the chairman of each of the four Commissions. 2. The commission for England shall consist of the chairman, the Registrar-General of Births,Deaths and Marriages in England, the Director-General of Ordnance survey and two other members of whom one shall be appointed by the Secretaryof State and the other by the Minister of Health.&quot; Then: &quot;6. One of themembers of each Commission, to be nominated by the chairman, shall bedeputy chairman of the Commission.&quot; Paragraph 7 contains a clausedisqualifying any member of the House of Commons, or of either House ofthe Parliament of Northern Ireland. Your Lordships will see that the speaker of the House of Commons is Chairman of each Commission.The Master of the Rolls: This disqualification in Paragraph 7, therefore,does not appear to affect him.The Attorney-General: No. Then in Part III, Procedure, Paragraphssays : &quot; For the purpose of considering any matter of common concern, the commissions, or any two or three of them, may hold joint meetings &quot;, sowhen any question arises of common concern to the Welsh or ScottishCommission they can meet together with the English Commission if required.Then Paragraph 7 : &quot; Every document purporting to be an instrument made or issued by a Commission and to be signed by the secretary or any person authorised to act in that behalf, shall be received in evidence and shall, untilthe contrary is proved, be deemed to be an instrument made or issued bythe Commission.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: What is the point of-Paragraph 7?The Attorney-General: Merely that once the document purports to be.the report of the Boundary Commission it is received.The Master of the Rolls: There is no question of that sort here, is there?The Attorney-General: No. I merely draw your Lordships&apos; attention toit. Then there is the Second Schedule, which is of great importance: &quot; rules for Redistribution of Seats. 1. The number of constituencies in the severalparts of the United Kingdom set out in the first column of the followingtable shall be as stated respectively in the second column of that table-Part
of the United Kingdom: Great Britain. No. of Constituencies:: Not substan-tially greater or less than 613. . Scotland-Not less than. 7.1.: Wales-Notiessthan 35.. Northern Ireland-12.&quot; - &apos;I would ask your Lordships now, because I think it will. help in themater, to glance at the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944.That was the first of these series of Acts, and it did two things. In 1944there were a number of constituencies with an electorate of over 100,000. Itwas the Act which set up the Boundary Commission. The first thing it didwas to make immediate provision for the splitting up of those very largeconstituencies; your Lordships will see that it enacted that those constituenciesshould be divided into more constituencies, which resulted in an increaseof 25.Would your Lordships look at page 392, the Third Schedule of the Houseof Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944? Your Lordships will seethat the first rule is very similar to the one I have just read to your Lordshipsin the 1949 Act, except that the number for Great Britain is &quot;not substantially greater or less than 591.&quot; Then if your Lordships would look at Rule 4, your Lordships will see there is the reference to the rule whichis important as part of the history in relation to the electoral quota: &quot;So faras is practicable having regard to rule 1 of these rules, the electorate of anyconstituency returning a single member shall not be greater or less than the electoral quota by more than approximately one-quarter of the electoral quota.&quot; So that the Boundary Commission was then faced with this taskunder the 1944 Act: Scotland, not less than 71 seats; Wales, not less than35 seats; and England would have a number not substantially greater or lessthan 591, less 71 and less 35. Having arrived at that figure, the constituenciesthen had to be so adjusted that the electorate for any constituency returninga single member should not be greater or less than the electoral quota bymore than approximately one-quarter of the electoral quota. I should tellyour Lordships straight away that Rule 4 has gone, because it made the division into constituencies, having regard to local affinities, local governmentboundaries, and things of that sort, in many cases quite impracticable.The Master of the Rolls: I am not sure that I have followed this. Wouldyou mind putting it again?The Attorney-General: You have here in Rule 1 the governing rule ofthe number of seats. We will come to what the electoral quota is in a mount, but you have in Rule 4 the rule that the electorate of eachconstituency must not exceed or be less than approximately one quarterof the electoral quota.The Master of the Rolls: If the electoral quota was 40,000 it must notbe more than 40,000 or less than 30,000?The Attorney-General: Yes, it had to be within those limits, and thatmeant, as your Lordship will see, a great deal of splitting up, taking wardsout of boroughs and putting them into county divisions, and things of thatsort. That rule has now gone, but I draw your Lordships&apos; attention toit because it shows that even at that stage there was to be a considerableamount of flexibility by the Boundary Commission in determining the constituencies having regard to the electoral quota.On the next page, Paragraph 8 (1) (a) says : &quot;For the purpose of these rules-(a) the expression &apos; electoral quota&apos; means (i) in the application ofthese rules to a constituency in Great. Britain, a number obtained by dividing the electorate for Great Britain by the number of constituencies in GreatBritain existing on the enumeration date, or, in applying these rules for the
purpose of section three of this Act, by the number of such constituenciesexisting at the commencement of this Act, namely five hundred and ninety-one.&quot; So that the main requirement there was that the number should benot substantially greater or less than 591, the then number of the Membersof the House of Commons.The Boundary Commission^ first report was in 1947. They recommendedan increase of five. Then there came the Representation of the People Act,1948, and although the Boundary Commission had recommended an increaseof five, that Act provided that the number should go up from 591 to 613,and that is how one gets the figure in Paragraph 1 of the Second schedule of the 1949 Act. In this instance, and it is material, Parliament despite theReport increased the number of constituencies by 17 above the numberrecommended by the Boundary Commission.Lord Justice Jenkins: That was then done by Act of Parliament whichwas correcting the error.The A attorney-General: Yes.Lord Justice Jenkins: Does such an Order in Council made under an act of Parliament introduce some kind of consideration of ultra vires!The Attorney-General: You have two different types; you have the Orderin Council which can be made and can be challenged by a negative resolution,or it may be subject to an affirmative resolution. You have what I might callhere the highest sort of Order in Council where the Draft Order has to besubmitted for the approval of the House of Commons first; if it is approvedthen it is submitted, and it may be made, so just iike your Bill on the third reading, the House of Commons has approved the contents of the Order asit has approved the contents of the Bill.Lord Justice Jenkins: Do you say it is the same thing as if it was doneby an Act?The Attorney-General: In this form of Order in Council which ispreceded by a Draft Resolution embodying the approval of the House, thatis so.Lord Justice Jenkins: It does say: notwithstanding anything in any enactment; that gets over the ultra vires difficulty.The Attorney-General: One gets all kinds of delegated legislation, I suppose one could regard these Orders in Council made under ah Act ofParliament in one sense as delegated legislation. It is not the ordinary formwhere power is given to a Ministry by signing a statutory instrument, givingthat instrument the force of law which again can be challenged in the Houseof Commons for 40 days. Before these Orders have any effect at all, theircontent has to be approved by resolution of each House.With regard to the first rule, that is the governing rule, the final numberof seats in Great Britain under this Act is not to be substantially greater orless than 613. I desire to make this point, that in the first place it is for theCommission to express their view as to whether a number is substantially greater or less than 613. It may be that Parliament will agree with that viewor not agree with it, but in my submission it is certainly not a matter for thisCourt or for any Court to decide whether a particular number is greater orless than 613 or whether the Boundary Commission ....The Master of the Rolls: Not whether it is greater Or less; anybody cantell that,
- The Attorney-General: Substantially greater; I left out the. word, I amsorry. It is not for this Court to decide that; if they were to take this uponthemselves, they are usurping &quot;the functions, of the Boundary Commission. Itis, as I say, for the Boundary Commission first and for Parliament second.It may be said that the increase of 25 made by the 1944 Act in the division ofthe big constituencies would have formed a small percentage of the total of591, but Parliament in 1944, as your Lordships will have seen, clearly meant that the 25 extra new seats which had immediately to be created ....The Master of the Rolls : 22, was it not?The Attorney-General: 25 under the 1944 Act.The Master of the Rolls : I thought it was from 591 to 613.The Attorney-General: No, my Lord, the 1944 Act had two stages ....The Master of the Rolls: I have got the thing wrong, it is my mistake.The Attorney-General: It said you must divide the big towns straightaway; that made 25 more constituencies straight away. That 25 had to be absorbed in a total not substantially greater than 591. That in itself is some indication that Parliament regarded 25 as a substantial increase on 591. Inmy submission, a percentage, be it small, increase on 613 is again no criterion,because in determining whether for the purposes of membership of theHouse of Commons the number is substantially greater or less than 613,regard should, in my submission, be had to factors peculiar to Parliament, thehistory of Parliament with regard to numbers, the fact that in 1944 and again in 1949 the governing consideration is to keep the number something likethe present number of Members, also having regard to the size of theChamber.....The Master of the Rolls: Could you help me, Mr. Attorney. Youprobably assume, and may assume wrongly, that I have clearly in my mind the basis on which Mr. Justice Roxburgh thought that the Commission had gone wrong.The Attorney-General: I can say that in a nutshell; I am sorry my Lord,I ought to have indicated that. He came to the conclusion that under these rules the governing factor was that the electoral quota of Great Britain shouldbe applied; you should then see the result of that arithmetical sum applying the electoral quota to the electorate of England and create the number oi&quot;seats for England in conformity with that quota, unless it was substantially greater than the number which England could have in regard to Scotlandand Wales.In my submission, he was wrong in so doing, because as I submit to your Lordships on this first view which I am now animadverting upon, thatis the governing factor, it must not be substantially greater and if in theCommission^ View an increase of 13 was in their view substantially greater,then under the Rules they would be entitled in my submission to makeadjustments so as to bring down the number to a figure which was not in theiropinion substantially greater. As your Lordships will see when one looksat the Reports, that is what they did both in 1947 and in 1954.The Master of the Rolls : Is this what it comes to: it was discovered thatfirst of all you subtract this 106 I assume that is right and not 118, whatever it is-from 613. You then found that if you divided the total electorate bythe electoral quota, the resulting figure would be substantially different, or i assume more than 613 minus 106. Having arrived at that figure, they thensaid: We must now in effect enlarge the electoral quota or enlarge the constituencies here and there to keep the number down.47418c
: The Attorney-General: Yes, and that is what is bound to happen when one has these minimum figures in Scotland and Wales with a smallerpopulation in the constituencies, in consequence, than one has in an Englishconstituency. I was just going to come on to that, but the number here ifyou apply the electoral quota would mean an increase of 13 seats.The Master of the Rolls: The electoral quota I do not know, I havenot followed it all is not in itself an immutable figure; that was merely to begin with an arithmetical result, then they said: you must use the result,no longer as a conclusion, but a promise.The Attorney-General: It is a yardstick. The point I am trying to make good is this, because Mr. Justice Roxburgh expressed a view on this increaseof 13. My learned friend argued it was really 2 per cent, increase, and couldnot be substantially greater. The point I am trying to make good is that it isnot for my learned friend or Mr. Justice Roxburgh; it is a matter in the firstplace for the Boundary Commission and then for Parliament. The figureif you take 106 from 613, because we can leave out Northern Ireland, is507 seats for England, but Wales had in fact at the time of this boundary commission 36, so we are left with this that the number of Englishconstituencies is not to be substantially greater or less than 506.Rule 4 is the next important Rule: &quot;1. So far as practicable&quot; your lordship will note these words &quot; having regard to the foregoing Rules &quot; :&quot; (a) In England and Wales, (i) no county or any part thereof shall beincluded in a constituency which includes the whole or part of any othercounty or the whole or part of a county borough or metropolitan borough;(ii) no county borough or any part thereof shall be included in a constituencywhich includes the whole or part of any other county borough or the wholeor part of a metropolitan borough; (in) no metropolitan borough or any part thereof shall be included in a constituency which includes the whole or partof any other metropolitan borough; (iv) no county district shall be includedpartly in one constituency and partly in another &quot;; and then there are theprovisions about Scotland and Ireland.Your Lordships will see that the local government boundaries are, sofar as possible, so far as practicable, having regard to the foregoing ruleto be preserved. Then Rule 5 this is where one gets the electoral quotacoming in &quot; The Electorate of any constituency shall be as near the electoral quota as is practicable having regard to the foregoing rules.&quot; may i pause there for one moment and say that that in my submission means no more than it says, that the Boundary Commission have got to try to getthe electorate as near as possible to the quota having regard, among other things, to the total number of seats, being limited in England to a numbernot substantially greater than 506. Rule 5 continues : &quot; And a boundary commission may depart from the strict application of the last foregoingrule if it appears to them that a departure is desirable to avoid an excessivedisparity between the electorate of any constituency and the electoral quota,or between the electorate thereof and that of neighbouring constituencies in the part of the United Kingdom with which they are concerned.&quot; So you can adjust County Boroughs and Borough boundaries to avoid an excessivedisparity, and having regard to the final number, which is Rule 1, the firstRule of the foregoing Rules, the aim and object is to get the number of constituencies as near as practicable to the electoral quota.Rule 6, which is another matter which the Boundary Commission can have in mind: &quot;A Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last two foregoing rules if special geographicalconsiderations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a
constituency, appear to them to render a departure desirable. 7. For thepurpose of these rules (a) the expression &apos; electoral quota &apos; means-(i) in theapplication of these rules to a constituency in Great Britain, a numberobtained by dividing the electorate for Great Britain by the number of constituencies in Great Britain existing on the enumeration date.&quot; I do notthink I need refer your Lordships any more to that.The Master of the Rolls: The enumeration date I see is defined.The Attorney-General: That is defined also, my Lord. All I need desireto say is that the calculation of the electoral quota is a pure mathematicalcalculation. Having got your electoral quota, it is a kind of yardstick which you apply, but which is applied subject to this, that the result of its application must give you a final number which is in relation to England not substantially greater than 506. There have been two Boundary CommissionReports so far, one in 1947 and this one in 1954 which refers to the one in 1947. Would your Lordships be good enough to glance first at the1947 Report, then I propose to ask your Lordships to look at the 1954 Report,the material parts, and then come straight away to the judgment ofMr. Justice Roxburgh. May I ask your Lordships to look straight awayat Paragraph 9 of the 1947 Report: &quot;It is provided in Rule 1 of our instructions that the number of constituencies in Great Britain shall not be substantially greater or less than 591 of which the number of constituencies in Scotland shall be not less than 71 and the number of constituencies in wales shall be not less than 35. Thus the number of constituencies availablefor redistribution in England was to be not substantially greater or lessthan 485. Before we could proceed with the formulation of our proposals on this basis, however, it became necessary to consider the effect ofRule 7&quot; that is under the old rules &quot; which excludes the City ofLondon from the redistribution procedure and leaves the decision whetherits allotment shall be two seats or one to be determined by Parliament. we came to the conclusion that it would be sufficient to assume for the purposesof our review that there would be only one seat for the City of London,and to base our recommendations upon a total distribution of 484 seats. this assumption was made only for the purpose of arriving at a provisional totalnumber of seats, and in no way to anticipate the ultimate decision ofParliament. We allocated the 484 seats provisionally to administrativeCounties with their associated County Boroughs on the basis of 1 seat foreach complete unit of electors, the unit representing the average electorate inEngland, namely 59,312 determined by dividing by the English electorate,namely 28,706,999 (excluding Universities and the City of London) by 484.&quot;They do not purport to take in 1947 for that calculation the electoral quota;they apply a calculation to arrive at a unit.Paragraph 10 says: &quot;Our general aim was the creation of constituenciesas near the electoral quota as practicable consistent with the preservation oflocal unities.&quot; I need not read any more of Paragraph 10, but in 11 they say in the middle: &quot; In fact our final recommendations involve the divisionof&quot; England into 489 constituencies.&quot; Then there is one sentence I wouldlike to read in Paragraph 12 about the sixth line; they deal with accessibilityand say: &quot; Having reached this conclusion, we next had to determine whatdegree of variation from the electoral quota was proper for the purpose of preserving local unity.&quot; They have considered that, and in Paragraph 14they say in the second sentence: &quot; In allocating additional seats we havebeen bound by the effect of Rule 1, namely that the number of constituencies in England should be not substantially greater or less than 484 and we have felt compelled to use sparingly the limited discretion given to us.&quot;1947418 c 2
I have referred to that because your Lordships ought to see the first report of the same Commission. Your Lordships will see when we nowturn to the Boundary Commission Report of 1954 that precisely the same basis was adopted by this Commission in relation to the present situation as was adopted in 1947 in their Report which, of course, was not challenged by any injunction or anything of that kind at that time.Sir Andrew Clark: And was made under a totally different Act whichwas repealed.The Attorney-General: I have made it clear to their Lordships it wasmade under a different Act which was repealed, containing rules which are almost precisely similar.The Master of the Rolls: I cannot see that the absence of the injunctionis a relevant point.The Attorney-General: Then may I come to Paragraph 8 of the 1954Report. May I say in relation to my learned friend&apos;s interruption that the1947 Report was made under a different Act but containing rules which  /ere similar in this respect that there again the governing consideration was to be that the number of English seats should not be substantially greater than the specified total. Paragraph 8 says: &quot; Rule 1 of our instructions provides that the number of constituencies in Great Britain wasnot to be substantially greater or less than 613 of which the number of constituencies in Scotland shall be not less than 71 and the number of constituencies in Wales shall be not less than 35. At an early stage of ourproceedings we were advised that it was unlikely that the Boundary Corn-missions for Scotland and Wales would find it necessary to allocate morethan the existing number of seats, namely 71 in Scotland and 26 in Wales.We thus proceeded on the basis that the number of constituencies availablefor distribution in England was to be not substantially greater or less than506, and we allocated seats provisionally &quot; I ask your Lordships to markthat word &quot; to administrative Counties with their associated county boroughs on the basis of 1 seat for each complete unit of electors, the unitrepresenting the average electorate in England, namely 57,122, determinedby dividing the total English electorate, namely 28,904,108 by 506.Paragraph 9 : Our aim was to create 506 constituencies, each of whichwould be at or near the electoral quota, without cutting across local govern-ment boundaries. Where the grouping of the local population permitted ofthis, the task was simple. The numerous cases where it did not. called forspecial consideration, the choice lying between departing substantially fromthe quota &quot; your Lordships will note that &quot; or disregarding boundaries.In many instances we decided in exercise of the discretion given to us inRule 6 &quot;-that is the rule relating to geographical considerations &quot; thatwe would be justified in recommending the creation or continuance of constituencies with electorates substantially below or in excess of the electoral quota but in no case have we recommended the creation of a constituencywith an electorate in 1953 of less than 40,000 or more than 80,000. Para-graph 10: our final recommendations involve the division of England into511 constituencies with broad ranges of electorates as follows &quot;, so that theyare finally recommending an increase of 5. I need not read those figures,but just read at the end of that paragraph : &quot; Thus 410 constituencies, ormore than 80 per cent, of the whole, fall within the range of 45,000 to 65,000of which the electoral quota (55,670) forms the mean.&quot;If I may make this comment straight away, there is nothing in mysubmission in those paragraphs of the Report to show that the boundary commission did not calculate the electoral quota in accordance with the
requirements of the Act. There is everything to show that in fact they did so.They have adopted precisely the same process as in the first initial report ofthe Commission. Having determined the electoral quota, they then endeavourto create 506 constituencies with the electorate at or near the electoral quotawithout cutting across local government boundaries that is Paragraph 9.They make the other calculation; there is another yardstick if you cannotgive the-total figure which you arrive at by the application of the electoral quota of finding the unit which should represent the average electorate inEngland, namely 57,122 determined by dividing the total English electorateby 506. They can do this; they did it before, there was nothing to prevent them under the Act, and there is nothing in this, in my submission, to showthat they have not complied with the requirements as to the electoral quota.I do say that there is no ground for saying that the Boundary Commissionin any way departed from the requirements of the Act.Now I think it may be convenient if I read to your Lordships the judgment of Mr. Justice Roxburgh: &quot;By .Section 2 of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, hereinafter called the Act, it is providedthat, &apos; Each Boundary Commission&apos; and we are here concerned with theEnglish Boundary Commission &apos; shall keep under review the representation in the House of Commons of the Part of the United Kingdom with whichthey are concerned&apos; that is to say, England &apos; and shall, in accordance withthe next following subsection, submit to the Secretary of State reports withrespect to the whole of that part of the United Kingdom, either (a) showingthe constituencies into which they recommend that it should be divided inorder -and these are very important words &apos; to give effect to the rules setout in the Second Schedule to this Act; or (b)&apos; and this did not happen &apos; stating that, in the opinion of the Commission, no alteration is required.&apos;Subsection (5) provides: &apos; As soon as may be after a Boundary commission have submitted a report to the Secretary of State under this Act&apos; and theseare three important words &apos; he shall lay the report before Parliamenttogether, except in a case where the report states that no alteration is requiredto be made in respect of the part of the United Kingdom with which theCommission are concerned, with the draft of an Order in Council for giving effect, whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations contained in the report.&apos; Subsection (4) of Section 3 is: &apos; If any such draft is approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, the Secretary of state shall submit it to His Majesty in Council&apos; this was 1949 and Subsection (7)of Section 3 is: &apos; The validity of any Order in Council purporting to be madeunder this Act and reciting that a draft thereof has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament shall not be called in question inany legal proceedings whatsoever.&apos; Now it would be a work of supererogationto mention that the Boundary Commission has reported, that the Secretaryof State did lay the draft of an Order in Council before Parliament, and thatit has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. If,therefore, it is a draft which complies with the requisites of the Act it is theduty of the Secretary to submit it to Her Majesty, and if he does, and if her majesty makes an Order in the terms of the draft then it cannot be called in question in any legal proceedings whatever.&quot; May I say there, there is no suggestion here that the draft did not comply with the requisites of the Act.The Master of the Rolls: Is there not?Lord Justice Jenkins: It has been suggested by the Plaintiffs, but you can say with force that is not the question. The question is whether this isa report emanating from the Commission, made pursuant to the functionsof the Commission under the Act. &quot;
The Attorney-General: I was really trying to shorten it, to deal withthe. point.The Master of the Rolls: It certainly has been said that the report didnot comply with the requisites of the Act in so far as it is alleged that theCommission has misapprehended their duty.The Attorney-General: That has been said, but the Act does requirespecial requirements in relation to a draft order; one of them was that ithad to recite the resolution of each House of Parliament.The Master of the Rolls: I do not suppose anybody has suggested ithas gone wrong on that.The A attorney-General: I was dealing with it to get that out of the way.The Master of the Rolls: Those things are always done for theCommissioners by their Secretary.Lord Justice Jenkins: On the way the learned Judge expressed himselfhere, the Home Secretary every time this happens would have to go and getthe opinion of Counsel or issue an originating summons as to whether thiswas a report under which he could proceed under the Act. It would be avery good thing for the Chancery Division but ....The Attorney-General: It would hold up Government business: &quot;Ifrom that derive certain general conclusions. One is that it was contemplated that this procedure would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts untiiHer Majesty had made an Order in Council&quot;  in my submission thereis no ground for that conclusion &quot; Nobody doubts that Parliament issupreme, and that Parliament can repeal or enact any law, but it can only do that by passing an enactment. This is a species of delegated legislation,and I think it appears from the form of the Act itself that it was intended that the Courts should intervene in a proper case up to the time whenHer Majesty made an Order in Council.&quot; In my submission, as I have saidto your Lordships, if it is a species of delegated legislation, that is thehighest category of that species, and there is nothing which in my submissionfrom the form of the Act warrants the conclusion that the Courts shouldhave power to intervene.&quot; Secondly, it appears to me that the Secretary of State, if and when hesubmits a draft Order to Her Majesty in Council, is not doing it in his general capacity as Secretary of State, but is doing it as a person to whomthe duty of doing so is expressly delegated by the provisions of this Act which contains the machinery which is to be used.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: With all respect, I do not think I quite follow that.The Attorney-General: I think it is meant to mean that he is not whenhe is charged by the Act.rhe Master of the Rolls : Of course the Secretary of State is the delegatedperson to do this particular thing. It does not follow therefore that he isnot doing it in his capacity as Secretary of State.The Attorney-General: I do not think it does follow. The Secretary ofState for the time being is charged by Parliament to do it as part of the dutiesof his office. The learned Judge goes on: &quot;I do not as at present advisedthink that the Crown Proceedings Act has any bearing on the present case.If I am wrong in this conclusion I hope to be excused in the light of the facithat it is now 5-40 p.m., and in the light of certain other facts to which 1
shall shortly be referring. Now it seems to me that there is not the leastdoubt that the Secretary of State is not entitled under this Act to do anythingunless and until the Boundary Commission have submitted a report to theSecretary of State under this Act, and I do not think that that empowersthem to submit any sort of report that they feel inclined to submit. I thinkthat that means a report at which they have arrived in compliance with theduty entrusted to them by this Act, and that was to give effect to the rulesset out in the second schedule of the Act, and it would seem to me that ifanybody had intervened (in the manner in which the publication of these things was made early intervention would have been extraordinarily difficult)at a very early stage it might have been possible to prevent the Secretary ofState from ever laying the report before Parliament.&quot; That was perhaps oneof the matters that Mr. Justice Harman considered, a judgment that was notread to Mr. Justice Roxburgh. &quot; However, that is a thing of the past, and whatever may be thought of my judgment I no longer feel that I am in any danger of running into conflict with Parliamentary privilege, and that at leasthas somewhat eased my mind. Nobody, of course, would contend that aresolution of each House of Parliament could of itself amount to an enactment,and therefore it cannot be said that the fact that each House of parliament has approved the draft in question gives it legislative effect. It is but onestep in the machinery which is necessary to give it legislative effect. Now,in Section 3, Subsection (4), the words &apos; if any such draft&apos; refer back to thedraft which is to give effect to the recommendations of a report made &apos; underthis Act,&apos; and accordingly I arrive at the conclusion that if the report wasnot made under this Act then a draft of an Order to give effect to the report would not be a proper draft of an order within the meaning of Subsection (5)of Section 2.&quot; My submission is that it is clearly the report of the boundary commission, and that is that.The Master of the Rolls: May I put this point? I am not quite surehow far your proposition goes. Supposing the Commission said: there are far too many electors, so we will make it much easier by disfranchising every-body whose name begins with let us take an obviously suitable one B, andthen they presented a report which, by that device, reduced the number by several hundred thousand, and the House of Commons was either indiscreetenough, or, if you like, inattentive enough, to pass resolutions. The Mr. fi&apos;sthroughout the land would have no remedy at all, the thing was manifestlyoutside the scope . . . -The Attorney-General: That is assuming, if I may say so to your lordship, a very great deal.The Master of the Rolls: I quite agree.The Attorney-General: That is assuming a great deal of inadvertence onthe part of Parliament.The Master of the Rolls: Do you go the length of saying that so longas the thing bore on the outside of it &quot; the Report&quot; and two Houses ofParliament proceeded to swallow it and resolve, that is an end of the matterwhen the thing is demonstrably wrong, so it is not a report at all.The Attorney-General: I say it is not for this Court to say it is not areport at all, once the report has been presented to the Secretary of State as this one was by the Boundary Commission as Paragraph 1 says, once it is laid before the House of Commons, this is the Report of the boundary commission, be it good or be it bad or be it indifferent, it is then for theHouse of Commons and the House of Lords to have regard to their recommendations, which no doubt will always be carefully studied.   That
being so, it is a matter for Parliament, and if Parliament has approved byresolutions some of the recommendations with or without modifications it. is quite clear they can be accepted or rejected then in my submissionassuming errors either by the Boundary Commission or by Parliament, once the resolutions are passed, it is equivalent to passing an Act of Parliament.The Master of the Rolls: I feel a little more cautious, in saying no suchcase ever so far has been established, let it be supposed there is a doubt asto the exact inferences of some of these paragraphs, in considering whetherthe Courts have exercised a special remedy of ex parte injunction directed at an administrative action, it would at least need a very clear case to showsomething had gone wrong or there was a real danger of a manifest injustice,bearing in mind we are not doing more than dealing with an ex parteapplication.The Attorney-General: I am putting my case higher than that, and Ido adhere to the level at which I put it.Lord Justice Jenkins: You could go as far as to say it is enough for your purpose to say any report laid before Parliament purporting to be thereport of the Boundary Commission, purporting to deal with the redistribution of seats and not dealing with the disenfranchising of electors you could put it as wide as that saying it is beyond the power of the Courts to question it, and other machinery has been provided.The Attorney-General: Yes, forgetting about the ieport, where an act of Parliament has said an Order in Council may be made in the terms ofa draft resolution, after the draft has been approved by resolution of theHouse of Commons, once you have that resolution the Courts have no rightthen to intervene. Leaving on one side the question of a report, theconstitutional position is just the same as where you have a Bill which hasreceived its third reading and is only awaiting the Royal Assent. The Courtscannot in my submission possibly intervene then by injunction or bymandamus to prevent that R.oyal Assent being given. So here where you have the machinery that the Draft Order in Council containing what theHouse wishes to have given the effect of law is approved by both houses of Parliament, showing, just like in relation to a Bill when it has passedits third reading that they desire that Bill to be made law, you cannotintervene after that, the Courts cannot intervene by injunction to prevent theRoyal approval being given in Council.Lord Justice Jenkins: Certainly this proposition would stand to enablethe Court to interfere with any projected Order in Council between the timewhen it had been approved by the two Houses and the time it was presented to Her Majesty.The Attorney-General: One would only have to come along and ask foran ex parte injunction.Lord Justice Jenkins: Any case in which anyone could be found whoalleged it did not accord with the enactment under which it was made.The Attorney-General: Yes.Lord Justice Jenkins: It might be possible to raise an argument of thatsort in a very large proportion of cases.The Attorney-General: It might well; sometimes you get Acts saying thatyou can follow this procedure of approval of Draft Order in Council withoutany requirement of a report being laid before Parliament.   One has got to
consider when one is considering jurisdiction, the position if there was ;iotany requirement of the Report being laid before Parliament.Lord Justice Jenkins: Then when the Minister was charged with theadministration of the provisions of an Act where he has to lay regulations onthe table for so long, I suppose the dissatisfied person could get an Orderon him to take it off the table before it had been there for the appropriate time, to withdraw it.The Attorney-General: He might get an Order on an ex parte injunctionto restrain him from laying them so that Parliament could not get anopportunity to express a view upon them. What has happened, is, that theinjunction has been granted to prevent the Home Secretary submitting thedraft Order in Council to Her Majesty in Council for Her Majesty&apos;s approvalor otherwise.The Master of the Rolls: Her Majesty may call for a report. I do not mean there not being an injunction, but supposing he failed to present it,has the Crown the power to say, &quot; Where is the report? &quot;The Attorney-General: I would have said yes.The Master of the Rolls: No court would grant an injunction against their Majesty.The Attorney-General: Entirely so, and, of course, the Minister whofailed to comply with an obligation of this kind imposed upon him by act of Parliament would be subject to a great deal of questioning in the Houseof Commons, quite apart from the possibility that a report would be called for, and. as I said earlier on, this ex parte injunction places the Secretaryof State for the Home Department in a dilemma, either he is to postponecomplying with the statutory obligation, or, if he does comply, he presumablywill be guilty of contempt of court.Then going on at the top of page 5 the learned Judge says : &quot; Therefore,it would not be a draft which it was proper for the Secretary of State to lay before Her Majesty in Council&quot;--The Master of the Rolls : This is the kernel of the decision.The Attorney-General: Yes. &quot; Therefore, it would not be a draft whichit was proper for the Secretary of State to lay before Her Majesty in council under Section 3, Subsection (4), and that this conclusion could not be affectedby the fact that it had been approved by resolutions of both Houses because,as I said, that per se could not be substituted for passing enactments.&quot; Inmy submission, it really is not for the courts to decide in what manner theSecretary of State is to perform the duty laid upon him by the Act.The Master of the Rolls: The learned Judge is in effect saying that theStatute only directs him to present that which has certain characteristics.The A attorney-General: All the Act says is that, if the draft has beenapproved by resolutions of both Houses, he shall submit it. It does notrefer back to the report.The Master of the Rolls : No; I am not saying it is right.The Attorney-General: That is what the learned Judge said.The Master of the Rolls:   Sir Andrew consented to that.    If the .Commission presented a blank sheet of paper with humorous drawings oncalling it a report, they could not approve&quot; that.
The Attorney-General: It would be very difficult if it was in that form to draft an Order in Council embodying those recommendations with or without modification.Then the learned Judge went on : &quot; Therefore, the next question toconsider is whether or not the Report did give effect to the rules set out inthe Second Schedule to the Act. There is certainly a prima facie case thatit did not.&quot;  I challenge that.&quot; I need not at this late hour read all the rules, but the dominantconsideration is the electoral quota.&quot; In my submission, the learned Judgewas clearly wrong on that.&quot; The method of ascertainment of that is indicated in Paragraph 7 ofthe Second Schedule, and if those instructions are carried out a figure of55,670 is arrived at. The next ithing which they had to do, as I understandit, was to divide the total electorate of Great Britain (and &apos; Great Britain&apos;means England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland for thispurpose)&quot;-The Master of the Rolls: That is wrong in fact, is it not? That is thefigure you should have after the constituancy has been increased to 511.The Attorney-General: No, that is right, 55,670. It is the figure inparagraph 10 of the Report.The Master of the Rolls: I know it is, but that is arrived at, I thought,after the number had been increased to 511, and the real correct figure for thispurpose is 57,122; but that does not matter.The Attorney-General: I do not think that that is right. The processsurely is this.The Master of the Rolls: My brother seems to think I may be right.The Attorney-General: The electoral quota I think is based on taking thetotal number ....Lord Justice Jenkins: There is no doubt about what the 55,670 is. that figure I thought was arrived at by dividing the English electorate not by 506but by 511.The Attorney-General: No. The 55,670 is, in my submission, clearlydividing the electorate for Great Britain ....The Master of the Rolls: Let us not delay; but if you add up the numberof constituencies in the table, I am fairly sure you will arrive at a figure of 511.The Attorney-General: Yes, my Lord.The Master of the Rolls: And I thought that when saying 410, or morethan 80 per cent, of the whole, that is, of the 511, all within the ranges of the electoral quota, that is how that is got at, otherwise I do not see how itdiffers from the other figure.The Attorney-General: It is the definition in Paragraph 7(a): &quot;theexpression &apos; electoral quota&apos; means (i) in the application of these rules to a constituency in Great Britain, a number obtained by the electorate for GreatBritain by the number of constituencies in Great Britain existing on theenumeration date.&quot; So that the number of the electoral quota is arrived at by dividing the electorate of Great Britain by the total number, 613. I justwanted to clear that up.He goes on: &quot; If that calculation is carried out, the resultant figure is626, and if you then deduct the seats required for Scotland and Wales you
get a result of 519 seats for England.&quot; That would be the position. 1 accept that on the electoral quota.&quot; It is perfectly true that there is an overriding provision in Rule 1 that theallocation of seats to Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, was not tobe substantially greater or less than 613, but I think that it would be difficultto say that 626 was substantially greater or less than 613 &quot; . . . .The Master of the Rolls: I do not know. If you were doing the sumand the right answer was 613 and you produced 626, would you be told thatyou were substantially wrong?The Attorney-General: I should have thought&apos; so. Of course, in mysubmission it was not a matter for his Lordship to express an opinion upon atall. It is for the Boundary Commission in the first place.&quot; and therefore it would appear to me that the Boundary Commissionought to have approached the problem in accordance with the rules alongthose lines and then, of course, applied the geographical considerations andother considerations referred to in the rules which I do not at this late hourpropose to investigate. . It is quite plain from a reading of the Report thatthey did not approach the problem along those lines but along the differentlines which are there stated. Therefore, I reach the prima facie conclusionthat the Report was not a report made to give effect to the rules set out inthe Second Schedule to the Act and therefore not a report under the Act, and,therefore, not one in respect of which the draft of an Order could properly be laid before Parliament and that, accordingly the draft is not such a draftas under subsection (4) of Section 3 can properly be laid before Her Majesty.&quot; I have been much vexed to know what course I ought to take in thesedifficult circumstances. The motion was opened this morning ex parte.Realising the difficulty of what course I ought to take in a matter of this great importance, I gave special leave to serve Notice of Motion upon theSecretary of State for the Home Department returnable at 2 05 o&apos;clock this afternoon. The Solicitor-General most courteously appeared, and I must saythat I hoped that an offer would be made that this Order should not be laidbsfore Her Majesty until, without undue and unreasonable effort, the Courthad been able to give the matter full and proper consideration on a motioninter partes. I do not think there is anybody who could say that there is nota case to be tried here.&quot;  I do so unhesitatingly.&quot; I can well see that other people may take a different view from mine.That is not the point. I do not think anybody could say that there is not acase to be tried. Parliament, in its wisdom, in this Act has thought fit to saythat nothing can be done by anybody in any Court of Law after the Orderin Council has been made.  Therefore, for the plaintiffs, it is now or never.&quot; What is the position on the other side? Apparently, it will cause someinconvenience if the holding of the Privy Council at which the Order shouldbe submitted is postponed to a day later than next Tuesday.&quot; I should liketo say that that I understand was the arrangement, that one feels certain thatHer Majesty would if necessary summon a later meeting of the Privy Council,and I have not based the urgency of this case upon that as a mainconsideration.&quot;The Solicitor-General offered to postpone the submitting of the Orderuntil Monday. Monday is not a motion day. That would have meant nothing to me if I had not already got a heavy list of out-of-turn fixtures in Chambers,some of which are part-heard. I explained that I should be very willing to hear this case on Tuesday and to continue it until it was concluded, but the solicitor-General did not feel able to agree to that solution.   Accordingly, I
was faced with this: anybody is entitled to come to the Court for ex parteapplication and as far as I know it is the duty of the Judge to go on sittinguntil he has disposed of it, and that is why I am here at a quarter to six andhave done so, and if I have not given full weight to every possible considera-tion I trust that everybody will appreciate the circumstances that I have justfully elaborated: for the plaintiffs it is now or never; for the defendants itseems to be a matter of making an appointment for a further session of the privy Council.   What ought I to do in those circumstances?&quot; There is another thing I want to say. Looked at from one point of view this may be a very small matter. It may be said: &apos; What can it really matter to Mr. A (I am not speaking personally of anyone concerned in this case)whether he votes in one constituency or in another?&apos; But, on the other hand,the Parliamentary vote is a right of property and one very jealously guardedby British subjects and the loss of it or the transference of it is a matter whichis quite impossible of estimation in money. It does not sound in that sort of consideration at all.&quot; On balance it seems to me that the plaintiffs ought not to be put inthe position that they will be out of Court altogether until the case whichthey have to be tried and which they want to have tried has been tried. Ido not for a moment suggest that it has yet been tried. These are only mypreliminary ruminations on a most interesting theme, and accordingly Ipropose to grant an interim injunction against the Secretary of State to restrain him from presenting to Her Majesty until the time when I can hear,the motion any draft Order &quot; I do not think I need read the rest. That ispurely formal.As I submit, there is nothing in the report to warrant the conclusionthat there is even a prima facie case that the Commission acted wrongly andin disregard of the rules in the Second Schedule. Indeed, on the other hand,consideration of the report indicates quite clearly that they had regard tothe rules and regard to the electoral quota, and, in my submission, correctlyinterpreted them. Therefore, in my submission, there is&apos; no groundwhatsoever for this injunction. As I say, even if there was an error by the boundary Commission, it would not in my submission at this stage be amatter for the Courts, and I ask your Lordships to consider quite shortly,if I may, the position apart from the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947. andalso the effect of the Crown Proceedings Act.In that connection I think I must trouble your Lordships with one case.The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, reported in 1872Law Reports, 7 Queen&apos;s Bench Cases, at page 387. That was an attemptto mandamus the Lords Comimssioners of the Treasury to do something which they had clearly power to do. It was held that mandamus wouldnot lie in respect of a duty owed to the Crown, as. indeed, in mysubmission, the duty of the Home Secretary here under this Act was a dutyowed to the Crown and not to any individual elector, and I would emphasise that Doint. In my submission, this Section 3 of the Boundary CommissionAct did not impose a duty on the Secretary of State for the Home Departmenttowards any individual elector.(Passages from the judgment were then referred to)May I read the head-note of this case, if your Lordships have it: &quot; By29 and 30 Victoria chapter 89, section 14, when any sum of money shallhave been granted to Her Maiesty by Act of Parliament to defray expensesfor any specified public services, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty fromtime to time, by order under the sign-manual, countersigned by the Treasury,
to authorise and require the Treasury to issue out of the credits granted tothem the sums which may be required to defray such expenses not exceeding the amount of the sums granted.&quot; By the Annual Appropriation Acts, out of the sums granted to her majesty for the service of each year, a certain sum is applied to defray thecharges &apos; for prosecutions at assizes and quarter sessions, in England,formerly paid out of county rates.&apos;&quot;In the half year ending the 31st of December, 1870, certain prosecutionstook place at the assizes and quarter sessions of the county of L., andthe costs were taxed by the proper officers under the orders of the respectiveCourts, and the treasurer of the county paid the bills, and returned the bills,with the usual vouchers, to the Treasury. The Lords of the Treasury had appointed certain officers called the Examiners of Criminal Law Accounts,and these officers disallowed or reduced in amount fifty-one of the items inthe bills returned; and a rule nisi was then obtained for a mandamus to the lords of the Treasury, commanding them to issue a Treasury minuteauthorising the paymaster of civil contingencies to pay to the treasurerof the county of L., the sums disallowed:  &quot; Held, that a mandamus would not lie, inasmuch as the Lords of theTreasury received the money, which was granted to Her Majesty, as servants of the Crown, and no duty was imposed upon them as between them andthe persons to whom the money was payable. Held, also, that the course which the Lords of the Treasury had pursued, was erroneous, as they had no authority whatever to have the bills retaxed. and ought to have paid over tothe treasurer of the county the full sum which he had expended as costs of prosecutions.&quot;If I may turn to the judgment of Lord Justice Cockburn, at the top of page 394 he said: &quot; It is another thing, however, whether we have juris-diction to interfere in such a matter. And it does not follow that because there is no remedy for the county or borough who have paid all the costs as originally taxed, except that of applying by petition to the Crown, or bypetition to Parliament, it is not because there is no other remedy but thatwhich may be a fruitless and abortive one, that this Court has jurisdictionto issue a writ of mandamus. 1 take it, with reference to that jurisdiction,we must start with this unquestionable principle, that when a duty has to be performed (if I may use that expression) by the Crown, this Court cannotclaim even in appearance to have any power to command the Crown; the thing is out of the question. Over the sovereign we can have no power.In like manner when the parties are acting as servants of the Crown, and areamenable to the Crown, whose servants they are, they are not amenable to us in the exercise of our prerogative jurisdiction.&quot;Then, my Lords, there is also a further passage on page 395, threelines from the top- Perhaps I ought to start at the bottom of page 394:&quot; But. nevertheless, when the money is paid, I can entertain no doubt that itis paid to the Lords of the Treasury, as servants of the Crown; and though1 quite agree that according to the Appropriation Act they were boundto apply the money upon the vouchers being produced, and had no authority,to retax these bills, still I cannot say that there is any duty which make sit incumbent upon them to do what I cannot hesitate to say they ought tohave done, except as servants of the Crown: because in that character theyhave received this money, and in no other,&quot;A little lower down the page, in the next paragraph, your Lordships will see it says : &quot; Then with regard to the statute (29 and 30 Victoria, Chapter 39,Section 14), to which Mr. Gorst ingeniously called our attention with aview of fortifying the case for the applicants,. 1 cannot see anything in that
statute which imposes a duty at law upon the Lords Commissioners of theTreasury. It may be a duty that they owe to the Crown, or it may be a dutythat they owe to Parliament to apply this money in discharge of the amounts which the counties are compelled without any choice on their part to pay;but it is a duty to the Queen or a duty to Parliament, and it is not a dutyat law which by any legal proceeding or by the exercise of the prerogativejurisdiction of this Court we can enforce.&quot;Mr. Justice Blackburn dealt with it a little differently, on a different ground,but came to the same conclusion in a passage on page 397. &quot; Passing fromthat, the question remains whether there is any statutable obligation caseupon the Lords of the Treasury to do what we are asked to compel them todo by mandamus, namely, to issue a minute to pay that money: because itseems to me clear that we ought to grant a mandamus if there is such a statutory obligation, particularly where the application is made on behalf ofpersons who have a direct interest in the matter, namely, the treasurer ofthe county on behalf of the county which ought by the statute to have beenindemnified for the costs which they have been obliged to pay. But it ishere, I think, that the case fails. The general principle, not merely applicableto mandamus but running through all the law, is, that where an obligationis cast upon the principal and not upon the servant, we cannot enforce itagainst the servant as long as he is merely acting as servant.&quot;He applies that principle, as your Lordships will see, a little lower downin the same paragraph, in the sentence beginning: &quot; The same principleapplies to mandamus, if the duty is by statute, though perhaps &apos; duty&apos; is hardly the word to employ with regard to Her Majesty; where the intentionof the legislature shows that Her Majesty should be advised to do a thing,and where the obligation, if I may use the word, is cast upon the servants of Her Majesty so to advise, we cannot enforce that obligation against the servants by mandamus merely because the sovereign happens to be theprincipal.&quot;Then, my Lords, it is to the same effect at the bottom of page 399, justafter the reference to the Statute. He says: &quot; but I am unable to see thatthe sections amount to anything more than, that Her Majesty, to whom themoney was granted in law, is to administer it according to the advice ofher responsible advisers, and she must do it through the hands of her servants.I have found nothing, looking at the sections adverted to, to make the lords of the Treasury (who have the money in their hands brought from the Bankof England until it is paid to the recipients) in any way more amenable tothird persons than in the case I put during the argument of a private person&apos;sservant who has got money to pay weekly bills or other matters, or powerto draw upon a bank for that purpose, in which case the servant could notbe considered liable to third persons.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: I am not quite sure for my part whether I amgetting much assistance from this case. I will tell you why, right or wrong.In this case what you told us was that the county palatine of Lancaster, whopaid out the funds was entitled in some way to call upon the Treasury inperformance of their duty to them, the county palatine, to repay them, andthey said No, there was no duty except to administer as servants of the Crownthe sums under the appropriate Act in their case. Here what is said by theplaintiff is: We have had a proprietary right or rights, namely, a franchise,or are likely to have, that are affected in a way which we dislike as individuals,and we say that it is not a case here of there being a complete discretion in the hands of the Secretary of State; we say, right or wrong, that he canonly present to Her Majesty a report of a certain character, and the Courtcannot do something to dispute our individual rights.
The Attorney-General: The answer is this. They are not losing theirfranchise. They are merely having it exercisable in another constituency;that is all.   They are not being deprived of their right to a franchise.The Master of the Rolls: No; but a personal right of property of theirsis to be affected.   They say that that is so, and are entitled to say it.  -The Attorney-General: Why I am citing this case to your Lordships is because I submit the Act which one has to look at casts no duty on theSecretary of State towards individual electors. I submit that the duty caston him in that statute is a duty in his official capacity as a servant of theCrown, and I am citing this authority in support of the proposition that,where a Minister is acting as a servant of the Crown in the performance ofa duty owed to the Crown, neither mandamus nor injunction will lie.Differently, of course, where there is a duty imposed upon him by a statutein relation to members of the public. When one looks at this Statute, it isnot a duty imposed upon him in relation to members of the public. Hehas no discretion in the matter. He is compelled by Parliament to submit the report, and he is being restrained from doing that which Parliament byAct of Parliament has enjoined him to do.I did not intend to read much more. I think that is emphasised perhapsjust in a short passage by Mr. Justice Lush on page 402, where he says:&quot; I also am of opinion that this rule must be discharged. I think that the applicants have failed to make out that which is essential to entitle themto a writ of mandamus, namely, that there is a legal duty imposed uponthe Lords of the Treasury a duty as between them and the applicants to pay over this sum of money.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: I am troubled with this, because sometimes inthese cases, where the particular Minister concerned under the defence regulations and so on is acting in his capacity as a Minister, he is notfree from possible restraint by the Courts, is he?The Attorney-General: I am not suggesting that, where the stautory obligation is of the ordinary kind which implies a duty upon him in relationto individual members of the public; but here the statutory obligation is ofa very special kind. He is merely to act, if I may say so with great respect,as a conduit pipe. Once the resolution has been passed, he is the person to take it and lay it before Her Majesty. Once the Bill has received theRoyal Assent, someone is charged with the duty of taking it presumablyto Her Majesty to receive the Royal Assent. That is the only function ofthe Home Secretary in relation to these draft orders, once they are approvedby resolution. Prior to 1949, in my submission, an action would not lieagainst a Minister of the Crown for an act done by him in purportedexercise of the statutory authority. You could not sue a Minister of theCrown before 1949.In support of that proposition, I would just refer your Lordships to thecase of Hutton and Others v. Secretary of State for War, which is reportedin 1926, 43 Times Law Reports, at page 106. The head-note is very short: &quot; An action will not lie against a Crown Official, as such, for a wrongdone in purported exercise of a statutory authority.&quot;This was about notice to treat, and I think the facts as set out in thelast paragraph on that page apply: &quot;The facts in this case were that notice to treat had been given in October, 1925, and there had been a failure toagree. But it was not till March 1926, that the plaintiffs became aware thatin August, 1925, a certificate had been obtained under section 23 of theAct of 1842. Their case was that the tribunal mentioned in section 23 hada quasi-judicial function, and that, the section having been inserted for the
Mprotection of the landowners, they were entitled to be heard before a certificatewas granted.&quot;I do not think I need read any more of that, but then your Lordships will see that the Attorney-General of the day said that &quot; he desired to take thepreliminary point that an action against the Secretary of State for War, assuch, would not lie. The only remedy was by petition of right unless theexisting Secretary of State had acted wrongfully, and then he could be suedpersonally, but not as Secretary of State.&quot;I need not read through the rest of his argument. Your Lordships will see the point. Then Mr. Justice Tomlin giving judgment said: &quot; this wasa motion for certain injunctions in an action in which the plaintiffs were the tenants for life and trustees of certain estates in Yorkshire and the defendantwas His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the War Department, sued as such.His Lordship then stated the fac;s, and, continuing said that, in order to giveinterim relief of the kind asked for, it would be necessary for the Court tobe satisfied that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case. But, apart altogether from the merits of the case, he had to consider the preliminarypoint raised by the Attorney-General, and only if he was satisfied that thepreliminary point was not well founded should he be justified in granting anyrelief on this application: for the preliminary point, if well founded, struckat the whole basis of the action.&quot; The preliminary objection was that there was no right at all to sue theSecretary of State in his official capacity. First, it was said by the Attorney-General, and, indeed, not disputed by Mr. Schiller, that an action against theCrown would not lie. There were methods by which relief might be obtainedagainst the Crown but not by an action. Secondly, it was said by the attorney-General that an officer of the Crown could not be sued as such,and, in support of that, reference has been made to Raleigh v. Goschen(14 the Times Law Reports, page 36; (1898) 1 Chancery, page 73). the judgment in that case seemed to make it perfectly clear that an officer of theCrown could not be sued as such, although he might be sued as an individualfor any wrongful act proved to have been done or authorised by him. Inthe latter case, it was no answer to say that the act was done by virtue of his authority as a Crown official, if, in fact, the act was wrongful.&quot; Mr. Schiller had, however, sought to draw a distinction based on a passage in the judgment in Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker (17 the Times LawReports, page 496; (1901) Appeal Cases, page 561, at page 576). Theplaintiffs contention really received no support from the passage referred towhen it was read in its context. What Lord Davey was really saying wasthat in a case where an official was sued as an individual for a wrongfulact it was no defence to say that the wrongful act was done by him as anofficer of the Crown. The argument that an action would lie against aCrown official, as such, when a wrong had been done which purported tobe an exercise of a statutory authority, entirely failed. It was sufficient for the present purposes for him to say that, prima facie, this action wouldnot lie, and, that being so, the application must be refused.&quot;Here again, my Lords, I do not think I need refer your Lordships to thecase of Raleigh v. Goschen, but here again I say that prior to 1947 an actionof this kind would certainly not lie against the Secretary. of State for theHome Department. The Crown Proceedings Act of 1947 has not made suchan action lie.If I might now turn to that, I have it in volume 6 of Halsbury&apos;s Statutes,page 59. It is Section 17 of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947: &quot;TheTreasury shall publish a list specifying the several Government departments which are authorised departments for the purposes of this Act and the name and address for service of the person who is, or is acting for the purposes of
this Act as, the solicitor for each such department, that may from time to timeamend or vary tire said list.&quot; My Lords, the list is exhibited on page 3642of the White Book, and, so far as the Home Office is concerned, it is specifiedas the Home Office, not as the Secretary of State for the Home Department,Sir Andrew Clark: I do not know if it is any help if 1 say at once that I am not suggesting for a moment that these proceedings are brought under the Crown Proceedings Act. My whole argument before Mr. JusticeRoxburgh was that they were entirely outside that Act and had nothingwhatever to do with it., The Master of the Rolls: Do you say it is a tortious act?Sir Andrew Clark : I say it is a breach of a statutory duty by a personeo nomine and not relying on the statute.The Attorney-General: I want to refer your Lordship shortly to Section21. Subsection (3) of Section 17 says: &quot;Civil proceedings against the Crownshall be instituted against the appropriate authorised Government department,or, if none of the authorised Government departments is appropriate or theperson instituting the proceedings has any reasonable doubt whether any andif so which of those departments is appropriate, against the Attorney-General&quot;.  Now may I turn to Section 21.The Master of the Rolls: The strength of your case may be, may it not,in view of what Sir Andrew says, what is the alleged breach of duty to theplaintiff?The Attorney-General: There again. Section 21 (2), to which I will referyour Lordship, says: &quot; The court shall not in any civil proceedings grantany injunction or make any order against an officer of the Crown if the effectof granting the injunction or making the order would be to give any reliefagainst the Crown which could not have been obtained in proceedings againstthe Crown &quot;. That, in my submission, is a complete bar, if there was noother bar.&quot; Officer of the Crown &quot; is defined in Section 38 of the Act as including a Minister of the Crown. It is on page 72. It includes &quot; any servant of HisMajesty, and accordingly (but without prejudice to the generality of the fore-going provision) includes a Minister of the Crown.&quot; So Subsection (2) ofSection 21 prohibits in any civil proceedings the court from granting an injunction against a Minister of the Crown if the effect of granting theinjunction or making the order would be to give any relief against the Crownwhich could not have been obtained in proceedings against the Crown.The MasteKof the Rolls: Does that mean proceedings against the Crowneither by petition or under this Act?The Attorney-General: In my submission, yes. Here, of course, as I said earlier on, although the injunction is directed to the Home Secretary, theeffect of it is to prevent Her Majesty in Council considering whether or not to approve the Order in Council; but Subsection (2) does also, in my submission,relate back to Subsection (1) of Section 21: &quot; In any civil proceedings by or against the Crown the court shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, havepower to make all such orders as it has power to make in proceedings betweensubjects, and otherwise to give such appropriate relief as the case may require: Provided that: (a) where in any proceedings against the Crown anysuch relief is sought as might in proceedings between subjects be granted byway of injunction or specific performance, the court shall not grant an3347418 n
injunction or make an order for specific performance, but may in lieu thereofmake an order declaratory of the rights of the parties &quot;.So, in my submission, these are really in form proceedings against anofficer of the Crown, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, toobtain relief against the Crown, and Section 21 (1) (a) does provide that, if the proceedings were against the Crown, relief by way of injunction,which is sought here, could not be granted, nor, indeed, could a declaration.In support of that is a decision in the case of Underbill v. The Ministryof Food, reported in 1950. 1 All England Reports, at page 591. I do notthink I need cite that to your Lordships, unless my friend challenges thatproposition.Before I conclude my argument. 1 thought I perhaps ought to refer your lordships to the judgment of Mr. Justice Harman.The Master of the Rolls: Yes.   &apos;The Attorney-General: &quot; The object of this Motion is to remedy a grievance felt, it would appear, by the Corporations of the MetropolitanBoroughs of Hammersmith and of Fulham and of certain ratepayers inthose Boroughs as to a Report presented to the Home Secretary by the boundary Commission for England set up under the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act. 1949. The grievance is that if the recom-mendations of the Report be acted upon and become law, a part will betaken from the Borough of Fulhani, another part from the Borough ofHammersmith, and they will find themselves forcibly married under thename of the Constituency of Barons Court, not a borough, but called, forsome reason which I do not understand, a borough constituency. It is saidthat that is a grievance affecting both the boroughs from which parts willbe hacked off, and this Motion is therefore lodged because it appears thatResolutions to approve of this part of the Report are likely to be a matterof debate in the Commons House in the course of the present week, andthe scheme of the Act is that if the Report or the Recommendations in theReport are approved by Resolutions of both Houses, then it only needs the assent of Her Majesty in Council to make them, without more, part of thelaw. What I am asked to do is to order the Boundary Commission or its members or some of them to intimate to the Home Secretary that theirReport is a nullity, because, so it is said, they have not observed the rulesprescribed for them in making that Report.&quot;Then the learned Judge there dealt with the allegations, but expressed noview upon them. The allegations were really the same as here, that thereport was not a report of the Boundary Commission because it was saidthat the Boundary Commission had not applied the electoral quota. he expressed no view on that, and I think one can turn really straight awayto page 6 : \&quot; Now, in what am I to interfere? I am to enjoin upon themembers of the Commission that they should inform the Home secretary that they have acted in a way that is ultra vires? Well, supposing they did so inform him, he would not be bound, as far as I can see, to take anynotice of their rather tardy repentance, and I am not convinced that it wouldhave any effect on his mind if they did come before him, whether insackcloth and ashes or no, and say : &apos; We are afraid we have misread therules, because a Chancery Judge has told us so.&apos; Their recommendationshave been made; having sent in their Report, they have done their part ofthe task.&quot;It is said that if they have done it wrong, then their task is not complete;but I do not think that is right. In my judgment, if they have done it wrong,it merely means that they have made a mistake which the Home Secretary,no doubt, if he becomes aware of it may recommend the House to rectify,
or it may make the House itself to say: &quot;The Boundary Commission hasmissed the target; we will not accept its recommendation &apos; which, of course,the House is free to do.&quot; Where is there room for the intervention of the Court in an Act framedin this way? I do not find it. It is not the scheme of this Act that therecommendations of the Commission should be subject to review by theCourt while they are in the process of what I might call gestation. Parliamentcan do anything. In this Act it has provided itself with a staff to lean upon in the form of the Boundary Commission, so that, instead of having itself toconsider these matters at first hand, it has a report upon which it can act,either by accepting it or rejecting it; and it does not seem to me thatit is for the Courts at all to interfere, by injunction or advice or declarationor in any other way, with these recommendations. Even supposing it be right that the Commission has misused its function because it has misread the rules and that its Report is vitiated by that, it does not seem to me that it is forthe Court to interfere and say so. It is for Parliament to say if it so chooses.Parliament can, of course, overlook the omission if it likes, as it is omnipotent,and make the Resolution law even though the Commission was mistaken inthe basis of its recommendations.,&quot; Therefore in my judgment this is not a matter in which I ought to beasked to interfere or in which any good purpose would be served by myseeking to do so. I do not think questions of jurisdiction really need to be debated at this stage. I shall assume that I can, if necessary, express an opinion as to the proceedings of the Boundary Commission, without going beyond the functions of this Court, but I am satisfied that I should certainlyserve no useful object by doing so, and that the machinery set up underthis Act does not leave any room which makes it appropriate for the court to intervene either at this or at any other stage.&quot; It is said that those aggrieved have no method of voicing their grievances.I do not accept that at all. They are represented in Parliament like othercitizens, and they can there air their grievances if they so think fit, and 1suppose they will have a hearing there like other aggrieved persons here. Ifthere is justice in what they say, no doubt due weight will be given to it. Atany rate, I do not propose to lend such weight as the judgment of this Courthas to a debate of this kind which seems to me unsuited for judicialintervention. I therefore refuse the Motion.&quot; As I say, that was not read toMr. Justice Roxburgh.There is just one other case that I should mention, and that is the caseof The King v. Electricity Commissioners, reported in 1924 1 King&apos;s bench division, page 171. There it was held that a writ of prohibition would lieagainst the Commissioners. They had not completed their scheme. Theywere holding an inquiry under the scheme, and, in the course of holding the inquiry, it became clear that they were acting wrongly, and the Courtintervened. I think that appears quite clearly from the passage in LordJustice Atkin&apos;s judgment, as he then was, at page 201. I can, if need be,refer your Lordships to it; but I think I can summarise it. So here I would say that if before the Boundary Commission reported it became apparent thatthey were clearly acting wrongly, it might be that this Court could interveneand issue a writ of prohibition; but that is not this case. The facts in this case are far removed from the facts there. Once they have reported and theirreport has been laid upon the table and the draft Orders have been approvedby both Houses, in my submission this Court, and Mr. Justice Roxburgh, haveno jurisdiction to intervene.If I may say this in conclusion, here the proceedings are by two electorswho object to voting in different constituencies. In my submission, they haveno right to claim anything in these proceedings.  My Lords, in my submission3547418 d 2
145the proceedings are clearly directed at the wrong person, namely, to an officerof the Crown; the proceedings are clearly wrong in seeking injunction to restrain the Secretary of State for the Home Department from doing that whichthe Act of Parliament requires him to do, wrong in being directed against him as Secretary of State, for, as such, he cannot be sued.I submit that there was no error of the Boundary Commission, that thereis no prima facie case, and, indeed, no ground for saying that this was nota proper report of the English Boundary Commission, that it was not a report submitted under the Act. Draft Orders were made and approved, and thereis no right to interfere with them. As I submit, the Secretary of State hadno option but to submit this draft Order to Her Majesty in Council.My Lords, it is for those reasons, which I fear I have taken some time inputting before your Lordships, that I submit that these proceedings are really entirely misconceived, somewhat mischievous in their effect, and, indeed,if the view which I have been putting before your Lordships is right, in seeking to obtain an injunction in these matters, almost tantamount to anabuse of the process of the Court. It is for these reasons that I ask your lordships to order that this injunction be discharged.The Master of the Rolls: Thank you.  We will adjourn until two o&apos;clock.Part IISir Andrew Clark: My Lords, really this application divides into threeaspects of the case. The first aspect is the question of jurisdiction; thesecond aspect is the question of whether there are such errors in the report as fundamentally to make it not a Report in accordance with the requirementsof the Act; and the third aspect is: what is the plaintiffs&apos; interest to bringthe action? This being purely an ex parte injunction in my submission if Isatisfy your Lordships that there is an arguable case on each of those headsit becomes a question merely of balance of convenience; I have not to satisfyyour Lordships beyond all doubt. I merely have to satisfy your Lordshipsthat this is a case which the plaintiffs ought not to be shut out from theopportunity of arguing. If your Lordships come to the conclusion, havingheard it, that it is clear there is no jurisdiction, there is an end of this ex parteand it will be the end of the motion to-morrow because to-morrow Mr. JusticeRoxburgh on the motion would be bound to follow your Lordships&apos; decisionif your Lordships came to the conclusion that there was no jurisdiction or that the Report in substance was a perfectly good Report and did not differsufficiently to render anything that was done invalid.On the first point of jurisdiction, I think it would be most convenient if I referred your Lordships first, before adducing any argument, to theauthorities\pn which I rely because, in my submission, they make it reason-ably clear without necessity for very much argument. The first case isthe one which Mr. Attorney mentioned to your Lordships but did not read to your Lordships, The King v. Electricity Commissioners, reported in1924 1 King&apos;s Bench Division, which although it was a decision on an action which was brought at an earlier stage in the proceedings, was a casein which the facts really were completely on all fours with the present case,and certainly what your Lordships said in your Lordships&apos; Court is directlyin point though it may be it is dicta and not direct decision. The, case isremarkably similar.If your Lordships would be so good as to look at page 171 I will read the headnote: &quot; The Electricity Commissioners, a body established bySection 1 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, are empowered by thatAct to constitute provisionally separate electricity districts and in certain
events to formulate schemes for effecting improvements in the existing organisation for the supply of electricity in any electricity district soconstituted, and are directed to hold local inquiries upon the schemes. Ascheme so formulated may provide for the incorporation of a joint electricity authority representative of authorised undertakers within the electricitydistrict. By Section 6, Subsection (2) of the Act a scheme may providefor enabling the joint authority to delegate, with or without restriction, tocommittees of the authority any of the powers or duties of the authority.By Section 7, Subsection (1), the Commissioners may make an order giving effect to a scheme embodying the decisions they arrive at after holding alocal inquiry, and present the order for confirmation by the Minister ofTransport. By Section 7, Subsection (2), the order after confirmation is tobe laid before each House of Parliament and is not to come into operation now approved, with or without modification, by a resolution passed by each house, and when so approved is to have effect as if enacted in the act of 1919.&quot; The Commissioners constituted an electricity district and formulateda scheme providing for the incorporation of a joint electricity authority which purported to be representative of the authorized undertakers,, both localauthorities and electricity companies, in the district so constituted. The schemeprovided that the joint authority should at its first meeting appoint two committees, namely a local authority committee and a company committee,and assigned to each of these committees definite and separate portions of theelectricity district, and delegates separate powers and duties to eachcommittee in respect of the portion assigned. The Commissioners began tohold a local inquiry with a view to making an order embodying the scheme.&quot; Certain companies affected by the scheme applied for writs of prohibition and certiorari on the ground that the scheme was ultra vires inso far as it compelled the joint authority to appoint the two committees anddelegate to them powers and duties of the joint authority. Held that thescheme was ultra vires, and that a writ of prohibition should issueprohibiting the Commissioners from proceeding with the further considerationof the scheme, notwithstanding that an order embodying the scheme couldnot come into operation until confirmed by the Minister of Transport and approved by resolutions of the Houses of Parliament,&quot; and two cases were referred to.I can take your Lordships to the Judgment of Lord Justice Bankes,and the material part begins on Page 189 at the foot: &quot; The important partof the appeal has reference to the jurisdiction of the Court to make any ordereither for prohibition or certiorari. The first objection taken was that any application was premature, the matter being still only in its opening stage.The Commissioners, it was said, have decided nothing, they have merelypublished the scheme preparatory to holding the local inquiry thereon whichthey are directed by Section 5, Subsection (4) of the Act of 1919 to holdbefore making any order. This objection may be a valid objection to the granting of a writ of certiorari, but as it is not necessary to decide the pointI exoress no opinion upon it. With regard to prohibition, if the writ liesat all I do not thing that the objection is a sound one. The point was raised in the case of Byerley v. Windus. Mr. Justice Bayley deals with it in thisway. He says: &apos; And this brings me to the second question, whether theproceeding are in such a state in the Court below as to warrant a prohibitionat present&apos;; and he proceeds: &apos;But when once it appears by the proceedings in the soiritual court, that the prescription, instead of being admitted, isdisputed, and that the parties are in progress to bring its existence to trial,the Courts of common law are not bound to wait till the parties have incurredthe expense of putting it in issue, but the prohibition is grantable at once;
and it was upon this principle that the prohibitions were granted inDarby v. Cosens and in French v. Trask.&apos; The statement of what occurred at the local inquiry, as set out in Paragraph 15 of Mr. Fladgate&apos;s affidavitbrings this case, in my opinion, well within the principle laid down byMr. Justice Bayley, and I think that this objection fails.&quot; The other objections to the granting of any writ were much more serious, and they raise difficult and important questions, constitutional as wellas legal. In substance, the objections come to this: (a) that the proceedingsof the Electricity Commissioners are of an executive, and not a judicialcharacter; (b) that whether that be so or not, their proceedings in referenceto the preparation of schemes as directed by the Electricity Act, 1919, arecontrollable by Parliament, and by Parliament alone, and are such that thereis no moment of time at which the Court can intervene to inquire whetherthe proceedings are ultra vires or not. The argument on this secondcontention is presented in the following way: Section 7 of the Act, it is said,provides that the Commissioners may make an order giving effect to a scheme,but that order has no force or effect in itself. It is merely a suggestion oradvice to be passed on to the Minister of Transport, who may confirm ormodify the scheme.&quot; Pausing there, that in my submission is exactly thesame as the Report of the Boundary Commission which they pass on in this case to the Secretary of State. It is merely a suggestion or advice. &quot;even then the order has no force. It must first be approved by resolution passedby each House of Parliament, and then, and not till then, has the order anyforce or effect. As soon as the order has been approved by both Houses ofParliament the section provides that it shall have effect as if enacted in theAct.&quot; It is like the present procedure except that no Order in Council isrequired; the Resolutions of the two Houses are made binding instead ofrequiring the further act.His Lordship continues: &quot; The result, according to the respondents, isthat any application to the Courts for a writ of prohibition or certiorarimust be either premature or too late; premature if made before the orderof the Commissioners becomes an Act of Parliament, too late if made.after it has attained that status. This argument has only become possible sincethe Legislature has adopted the practice of providing that resolutions ororders which are directed to lie on the table for a certain period beforebecoming effective, or which have to be approved by resolution of the houses of Parliament, are, when approved to have effect as if they were themselvesActs of Parliament. The effect of legislation in this form was discussed inthe case of Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood, where Lord Watsonconcludes his speech by saying: &apos; Such rules are to be as effectual as if theywere part of the statute itself.&apos; The effect of accepting the argument of the attorney-General on this point would be very far reaching. It would amountto a decision that the subject has no longer the right in cases like the present,where this form of legislation is adopted, to come to a Court of law and demand an inquiry whether the action, or decision, of which he is complainingis ultra vires or not. I question very much whether Parliament had anydeliberate intention of producing this result by adopting this particular formof legislation.&quot; I pass now to consider the contention that if the Court makes an orderin the present case for the issue of a writ of prohibition it will be trespassingon ground reserved for Parliament to itself. I cannot see why this actionof the Court should be so regarded. By the Act of 1919 Parliament laiddown the limits of the jurisdiction of the Electricity Commissioners. It did so presumably because it considered that those limits were the proper ones,and the ones which the Commissioners should observe. Why shouldParliament object to a Court of law, if appealed to, using its powers to
keep the Commissioners within those limits? Parliament no doubt has, asbetween itself and the Commissioners, provided that no order of theCommissioners shall have effect unless first approved by Parliament. this reservation must, I consider, be treated as a reservation for the purposes ofcontrol, and does not in my opinion exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of law. If any decision of a Court of law in the opinion of Parliamentunduly fetters the action of the Commissioners it is always open to Parliamentto extend the limits of that jurisdiction.&quot; I have so far only dealt in a general way with the arguments addressedto the Court by the Attorney-General. The real question is whether theprinciples already laid down in reference to the power and duty of theCourts to issue writs of prohibition apply to the present case. There can,of course, be no exact precedent, as the Electricity Commissioners are a body of quite recent creation. It has,, however, always been the boast of our common law that it will, whenever possible, and where necessary, applyexisting principles to new sets of circumstances.&quot; Then his Lordship goes on to consider writs of prohibition and I need not trouble your Lordshipswith the rest of that Judgment.I ask your Lordships to be so good as to look at Lord Justice AtkinsJudgment on page 207 where he deals with this point in the first newparagraph: &quot; It is necessary, however, to deal with what I think was themain objection . of the Attorney-General. In this case he said theCommissioners corns to no decision at all. They act merely as advisers.They recommend an order embodying a scheme to the Minister of Transport,who may confirm it With or without modifications. Similarly the Ministerof Transport comes to no decision. He submits the order to the Houses ofParliament, who may approve it with or without modifications.&quot; That isexactly the present case. &quot; The Houses of Parliament may put anythinginto the order they please&quot; this is the argument, not what his Lordshipholds because he holds this is wrong &quot; whether consistent with the act of 1919.or not. Until they have approved, nothing is decided, and in truththe whole procedure, draft scheme, inquiry, order, confirmation, approval,is only part of a process by which Parliament is expressing its will, and at no stage is subject to any control by the Courts. It is unnecessary toemphasise the constitutional importance of this contention. Given its full effect, it means that the checks and safeguards which have been imposed by Act of Parliament, including the freedom from compulsory taking, canbe removed, and new and onerous and inconsistent obligations imposedwithout an Act of Parliament, and by simple resolution of both Houses ofParliament.&quot; I do not find it necessary to determine whether, on the properconstruction of the statute, resolutions of the two Houses of parliament could have the^effect claimed. In the provision that the final decision ofthe Commissioners is not to be operative until it has been approved by thetwo Houses of Parliament, I find nothing inconsistent with the view thatin arriving at that decision the Commissioners themselves are to act judiciallyand within the limits prescribed by Act of Parliament, and that the Courtshave power to keep them within those limits. It is to be noted that it is theorder of the Commissioners that eventually takes effect; neither the Ministerof Transport who confirms, nor the Houses of Parliament who approve, canunder the statute make an order which in respect of the matters in question has any operation: I know of no authority which compels me to holdthat a proceeding cannot be a judicial proceeding subject to prohibition orcertiorari because it is subject to confirmation or approval, even where theapproval has to be that of the Houses of Parliament. The authorities areto the contrary.
Then his Lordship. considers the authorities and I can turn to page 210,first new paragraph, where Lord Justice Atkin says: &quot; In coming to theconclusion that prohibition should go we are not, in my opinion, in any degreeaffecting, as was suggested, any of the powers of Parliament. If the aboveconstruction of the Act is correct the Electricity Commissioners are themselvesexceeding the limits imposed upon them by the Legislature, and so far fromseeking. to diminish the authority of Parliament we are performing theordinary duty of the Courts in upholding the enactments which it has passed.Nothing we do or say could in any degree affect the complete power of theLegislature by Act of Parliament to carry out the present scheme, or anyother scheme. All we say is that it is not a scheme within the provisionsof the Act of 1919. That it is convenient to have the point of law decidedbefore further expense and trouble are incurred seems beyond controversy.I think therefore that the appeal should be allowed, so far as the writ of prohibition is concerned, and that the rule for the issue of the writ shouldbe made absolute.&quot; (Lord Justice Younger): I concur so entirely in the judgment justdelivered that I hesitate to add anything to it.&quot; His Lordship does proceedto add very useful views to it at the foot of page 211, where he says: &quot; Ifthen this Court be satisfied as it is that it has power to prohibit the Commis-sioners from further proceeding with such a scheme, ought it to hesitate toexercise that power in the present circumstances of this case? The Attorney-General presented to us a very weighty argument that it should, namely, thatthe Court, if it were now to intervene here, would be usurping the function of Parliament, which by the Act of 1919 has reserved to itself alone the privilege of expressing effective approval or disapproval of any scheme whetherauthorised by the Act or not, if brought before it after being made by theCommissioners and confirmed by the Minister of Transport. This importantcontention of the Attorney-General is the second matter upon which I wishto observe.&quot; If I thought that Parliament by Section 7, Subsection (2), of the Act of1919 has so enacted, I would myself at once accept the contention of the attorney-General. I would conclude that by the terms of the statute theCourt had been dispensed from all. responsibility in relation to the actioneither of the Commissioners in making, or of the Minister of Transport inconfirming, any scheme under it. In such circumstances any interference bythe Court at any stage would, I agree, be in the legal sense of the word animpertinence.&quot; But I do not so read Section 7, Subsection (2), of the Act of 1919That Act,.in my judgment, contemplates that the Commissioners&apos; order, which,when approved by a resolution passed by each House of Parliament, is tohave effect as if enacted in the Act, embodies only a scheme which under theAct the Commissioners are given power either to approve or formulate. Everyscheme under the Act remains the scheme of the Commissioners even after it is confirmed by the Minister of Transport and approved by Parliament.The modifications in a scheme inserted either by the Minister of Transportor by Parliament are limited to modifications, as I read the Act, which mighthave been lawfully made under the powers of the Act by the Commissionersthemselves had they been so minded. Parliament has not by the Act conferred upon the Minister of Transport nor has it in terms reserved to itself by a mere resolution of both Houses power, under the name of modifications ina scheme of the Commissioners, to insert in a scheme provisions which wouldunder the Act be beyond the powers of the Commissioners if inserted in thescheme by them in the first instance. So, at any rate, I read the Act.Fortunately, however, it is not necessary in this case to decide the very serious
question whether, if at any time Parliament should approve by resolution of each House a scheme which, adopting if I may the language of LordRobertson in Russell v. Magistrates of Hamilt , could in fact be shown tobe &apos; an abuse&apos; of the statute, the scheme so approved would nevertheless by virtue of Section 7, Subsection (2), &apos; have effect &quot;as if enacted in this Act,&apos;and would have to be given statutory force by every Court in which its terms were canvassed. To suggest that such a question is one which may in viewof the terms of this subsection arise, is not of course to suggest that parliament cannot sanction and give the effect of statute law to any schemeit likes. It is only to suggest that it may not have in this Act reserved to itself the power by a mere resolution of each House to give statutory effectto a scheme the formulation of which it has not by the statute authorised.&quot;On the question of whether a Secretary of State can be sued or whether an ex parte injunction can be granted there are various cases where it hasbeen and where no difficulty has been felt about it.The Master of the Rolls: Tell me, because I am in difficulty about this,whether this is right: what you are trying to do is to prevent Her Majestymaking an Order put it as you like.Sir Andrew Clark : With respect, no.The Master of the Rolls: If you are suing the Secretary of State as an individual and assuming you have sued him by his right title and not asMajor Gwiiym Lloyd-George what is your cause of action against him?Sir Andrew Clark : My cause of action is to prevent him from committinga breach of his statutory duty, a breach by which I suffer special damage,therefore an action which I can bring.The Master of the Rolls: His answer is: &quot;I am doing what the Statutetells me I have to do.&quot;Sir Andrew Clark : With respect my whole case is that he is doing exactly what the Statute does not tell him what to do. What the Statute tells him todo is a question of the construction of the Statute. Would your Lordshipslike me to deal with that now?The Master of the Rolls: No. I wanted to get this clear, because it looked to me as though you may be on the horns of a dilemma about it. Ican understand your saying it was wrong for him as Secretary of State topresent this report but then you would surely have to sue him as Minister ofthe Crown, either by petition or under the Crown (Proceedings) Act.Sir Andrew Clark : With respect, no.The Master of the Rolls : If you are saying he is as an individualcommitting a wrongful act I am not sure what your cause of action against him is.Sir Andrew Clark: I am saying that he is not acting as the Secretary ofState for the Crown; he is not acting as a servant of the Crown in presentingthis petition.The Master of the Rolls: You have sued him as such as the Secretary ofState for the Home Department.Sir Andrew Clark : Because he is the person named in the Statute as theperson to perform an Executive Act. He is directed by the Statute to performan Executive Act. He is the person denominated by that name to perform the
specific act and I say he is threatening to do something which he is notdirected to do under the Statute.. The Master of the Rolls: I should have thought you ought to have suedhim by his private name and say: &quot; You are purporting to do something andthat you can only do by saying you are Secretary of State for the home department and the thing you are doing is that which the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department must do &quot; and that that does not apply here.Sir Andrew Clark : May I put it in this way. The Act of Parliamentnominates a person, it might just as well have been the Master-at-Arms oranybody else, but it happened to nominate the Secretary of State.The Master of the Rolls: Supposing it had been the Master-at-Arms, you would not have sued him as Parker v. Master-at-Arms, but in his privatename whatever it was.Sir Andrew Clark : 1 should have sued him as Master-at-Arms if theStatute had directed the Master-at-Arms to do it.The Master of the Rolls: By naming him you are saying it is theindividual who answers the description of the Secretary of State.Sir Andrew Clark: I could and if necessary I should ask for leave toamend my Writ to sue him as the Rt. Hon. Gwilym Lloyd-George in his personal name, but in my submission it does not make any difference whether do that or whether I sue him as Secretary of State.The Master of the Rolls : I am not sure.Sir Andrew Clark : 1 should have submitted that it does not make&apos; any difference. If necessary I would ask for leave to amend the Writ if your lordships thought it was an obstacle in the way. I should have submittedit would not have made any difference because he is not named in the Act.It is not the &quot; Rt. Hon. Gwilym Lloyd-George&quot; but the &quot; Secretary ofState.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: Obviously not, for neither he nor his ministry is perpetual.Sir Andrew Clark : It is the Secretary of State for the time being who isnamed in the Act. Therefore, in my submission, I am right in suing theperson named in the Act whatever he is named, the Secretary of State. Thatis how we identify him. If I sued the Rt. Hon. Gwilym Lloyd-George and heceased to be Secretary of State to-morrow I should have had to have issued a new writ whereas by suing by his title as Secretary of State the action inuresagainst whoever is the Secretary of State for the time being.The Master of the Rolls: My trouble is that if you sue the Secretary ofState for the Home Department you are alleging that he as a Minister ofthe Crown is doing something subject to the restraint of this Court.Sir Andrew Clark : I am alleging that he is not doing it as a Minister ofthe Crown, but because he happened to be the person named by the Act to doit. He is not doing it as part of his duty to the Crown or as his duty as a minister of the Crown. He is not acting under his general authority as aservant or Minister of the Crown.The Master of the Rolls : As a private individual?Sir Andrew Clark : With respect, no. He is acting in pursuance of an act of Parliament which directs the holder of a particular office at the time
to do a particular thing. He is directed to do that as the holder of that office.It would be like for arguments sake suing the Vicar of Wakefield who is directed to do something by an Act of Parliament.The Master of the Rolls: The Vicar of Wakefield is corporation sole.Sir Andrew Clark : If someone is named in the Act of Parliament they become corporation sole.The Master of the Rolls: I am not satisfied about this. As I say I think you may be on the horns of a dilemma on this point. Parliament has now-resolved.Sir Andrew Clark : I would ask your Lordships here and now to resolveany doubt about that.The Master of the Rolls: You had better be careful because if we give you leave to amend I do not know where you would be.Sir Andrew Clark : There is nothing to stop me issuing another Writ this afternoon against the Rt. Hon. Gwilym Lloyd-George. I abide by mysubmission to your Lordship.The Master of the Rolls: Let us look at one of the authorities. I amseriously disturbed about this.Sir Andrew Clark: I was going to show your Lordship the sort of case where an injunction had been granted. For instance there is the case ofAttorney-General for New South Wales and Others v. Trethowan and Othersreported in 1932 Appeal Cases at page 526. That was a case where an exparte injunction was granted against the leader of the House ofRepresentatives to restrain him from presenting a Bill that was actually a legislative enactment to the Governor for His Majesty&apos;s assent. The head-note reads: &quot; The Constitution Act, 1902, enacted by the legislature of NewSouth Wales, was amended in 1929 by adding Section 7a, which providedthat no Bill for abolishing the Legislative Council should be presented to theGovernor for His Majesty&apos;s assent until it had been approved by a majorityof the electors voting upon a submission to them made in accordance with thesection; and that the same provision was to apply to a Bill to repeat thesection. In 1930 both Houses of the Legislature passed two Bills, one to repeat Section 7a and the other to abolish the Legislative Council.&quot;By Section 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, the legislature ofthe State had full power to make laws respecting the constitution, powers and procedure of the legislature, provided that the laws should have been passed in such &apos; manner and form&apos; as might from time to time be required by any act of Parliament, letters patent. Order in Council, or colonial law in forcein the colony:  &quot;Held, that the whole of Section 7a of the Constitution Act, 1902, was within the competence of the legislature of the State under Section 5 of theColonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, that the provision that Bills of the naturestated must be approved by the electors before being presented was aprovision as to &apos; manner and form&apos; within the meaning of the proviso; and accordingly that the Bills could not lawfully be presented unless and until they had been approved by a majority of the electors voting.&quot;If your Lordships will look at the fourth paragraph on page 527 that says :&quot; On December 10, 1930, the first two respondents, members of the LegislativeCouncil suing on behalf of themselves and all other members who were not
defendants, brought a suit in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (inEquity) against the present appellants and the respondent, Sir John Peden,the President of the Legislative Council, claiming a declaration that the twoBills could not lawfully be presented to the Governor for assent untilapproved by the electors in accordance with Section 7a of the ConstitutionAct, 1902, as amended, and for injunctions restraining the presentation of the bills.Upon an ex parte motion interim injunctions were granted, and the matter was adjourned for hearing by the full Court.&quot; Upon the hearing of the motion, it was demurred to by the defendantsupon the grounds (1) that Section 7a, Subsection 6, of the Constitution Act,1902. was^invalid; (2) that no facts were alleged which gave the plaintiffsany ground for equitable relief; (3) that having regard to the object of thesuit it was not competent.&quot; The full Court (Chief Justice Street and Mr. Justices Ferguson, Jamesand Owen; Mr. Justice Long Innes dissenting) overruled the demurrers,and granted the declaration and injunctions prayed. The proceedings are reported at 31 S.R. (N.S.W.) at page 183.&quot; The present appellants obtained leave to appeal to the High Court ofAustralia; the appeal was limited by the order to the question &apos; whether the parliament of New South Wales has power to abolish the Legislative Councilof the State, or to alter its constitution or powers, or to repeal Section 7aof the Constitution Act, 1902, except in the manner provided by the said section 7a.&apos;&quot; The High Court of Australia (Mr. Justices Rich, Starke and Dixon;Chief Justice Gavan Duffy and Mr. Justice McTiernan dissenting) dismissedthe appeal.   The appeal is reported at 44 C.L.R., page 394.&quot; The grant of special leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council was limited to the questions above mentioned as being the subject of the appealto the High Court of Australia. The facts and the actual decision in the privy Council were not material.Their Lordships do deal shortly at the end of their judgment with theposition. Towards the foot of page 540: &quot; The question then arises, couldthat Bill, a repealing Bill, after its passage through both chambers, belawfully presented for the Royal assent without having first received theapproval of the electors in the prescribed manner? In their Lordships&apos;opinion, the Bill could not lawfully be so presented. The proviso in thesecond sentence of Section 5 of the Act of 1865 states a condition whichmust be fulfilled before the legislature can validly exercise its powerto make the kind of laws which are referred to in that sentence. In orderthat Section 7a may be repealed (in other words, in order that that particularlaw &apos; respecting the constitution, powers and procedure&apos; of the legislaturemay be validly made) the law for that purpose must have been passed inthe manner required by Section 7a, a colonial law for the time being inforce in New South Wales. An attempt was made to draw some distinctionbetween a Bill to repeal a statute and a Bill for other purposes and between&apos; making&apos; laws and the word in the proviso. &apos; passed&apos;. Their Lordshipsfeel unable to draw any such distinctions. As to the proviso they agreewith the views expressed by Mr. Justice Rich in the following words : &apos; take the word &quot; passed &quot; to be equivalent to &quot; enacted &quot;. The proviso isnot dealing with narrow questions of parliamentary procedure&apos;; and later in his judgment: &apos; In my opinion the proviso to Section 5 relates to theentire process of turning a proposed law into a legislative enactment, andwas intended to enjoin fulfilment of every condition and compliance with every requirement which existing legislation imposed upon the process oflaw making.&apos;
&quot; Again, no question of repugnancy here arises. It is only a questionwhether the proposed enactment is intra vires or ultra vires Section 5. ABill, within the scope of Subsection 6 of Section 7a, which received theRoyal Assent without having been approved by the electors in accordancewith that section, would not be a valid Act of the legislature. It wouldbe ultra vires Section 5 of the Act of 1865. Indeed, the presentation of theBill to the Governor without such approval would be the commission ofan unlawful act.&quot; In the result, their Lordships are of opinion that Section 7a of theConstitution Act, 1902, was valid and was in force when the two Bills underconsideration were passed through the Legislative Council and the LegislativeAssembly. Therefore these Bills could not be presented to the Governor forHis Majesty&apos;s assent unless and until a majority of the electors voting had approved them.&quot; For these reasons, their Lordships are of opinion that the judgment ofthe High Court dismissing the appeal from the decree of the Supreme Courtof New South Wales was right. That was where an appeal was stoppedbecause the formalities required by the Act for which it was brought had notbeen performed.Lord Justice Jenkins: This case of Trethowan is a different case, is it not? You have got constitutional limits on the legislative power and to exceed those limits is a wrongful act and two members of the LegislativeCouncil on behalf of themselves and all others except those responsiblebrought proceedings to restrain that wrongful act.   That is it, is it not?Sir Andrew Clark: No. with respect. There it was a restraint on generallegislative powers, but in this case it is delegated legislation, and the delegated legislation under this Act is also subject to certain limits which put it exactlyon all fours. The delegated power to legislate here can only be carried outin accordance with the special requirements of the Act.The Master of the Rolls: Could you successfully have restrained asufficient number of the Members of the House of Commons from resolvingin the way they did?Sir Andrew Clark :  No.The Master of the Rolls: Why not?Sir Andrew Clark : Because their resolution would have no effect. if could have got in time, in my submission I could have restrained theSecretary of State from laying the draft Order and report before the two houses. Once he had laid it before them I could not restrain them. TheCourt would have no power to restrain them from doing anything. Theyhad been laid before the two Houses for their consideration, and to interfereat that stage until they had considered them would, in my submission, bea breach of privilege. The Houses would consider them. Non constat thatthe two Houses of Parliament, having considered them, would have cometo the conclusion that the Court have come to, and thrown them out.The Master of the Rolls: They have passed resolutions. You say theresolutions are a nullity, do you?Sir Andrew Clark: Yes, my Lord.The Master of the Rolls: You do?Sir Andrew Clark : I say that the resolutions have no effect at all.The Master of the Rolls: Which is the same thing.
Sir Andrew Clark: Yes.Lord Justice Jenkins: Why? because you say the report is not a report.Why do you say the report is not a report? because in some peopledview it might be that it departed from the Act. In other people&apos;s view itmight be entirely in accordance with the Act. Supposing both Housesthink it is in accordance with the Act, or near enough, and approve it, thematter can still be reopened.Sir Andrew Clark: May I give an instance in answer to that?Supposing the report had recommended that there should be 69 constituenciesfor Scotland instead of 71, as the Act says, and 30 for Wales instead ofthe 31 required by the Act. That, in my submission, would have been a clear case where there would be no power in Parliament to approve that report.  Here is an Act of Parliament which lays down certain requirements.Lord Justice Jenkins: If it had, one view is that in all probability thetwo Houses or the Minister would have seen it and made a modification.Sir Andrew Clark: They might or might not have done.Lord Justice Jenkins: It does not follow from a possible hypotheticalcase like that, that whenever there is a doubt, or two opinions are possible,as to whether the report follows the Act, that the whole matter is at large.Sir Andrew Clark: I accept that. All I am submitting to your Lordshipsis that the Court has jurisdiction to look at the facts, and it is for the court to decide whether there has been such a fundamental departure from theAct that it is not in substance a report made under the Act at all, which doesnot give effect to the Act.The Master of the Rolls: I am not sure logically that we had better not look at that first. I have great difficulty myself in following this part of yourcase.Sir Andrew Clark: May I look for a moment at the Act?The Master of the Rolls: Yes.Sir Andrew Clark: May I deal with the Act before I come to the rules soas to show your Lordships exactly what my submissions on the Act are?It has been pointed out to your Lordships that Section 1 of the Act saysthe purpose for which the Boundary Commission is set up. It is for thepurpose of the continuous review of the distribution of seats at parliamentary elections that there is to be a Boundary Commission.  It is purely for review.Section 2 (1) says: &quot;Each Boundary Commission&quot; and we are onlyconcerned with the Boundary Commission for England at the moment &apos; shall keepx under review the representation in the House of Commons ofthe part of the United Kingdom with which they are concerned, and shall,in accordance with the next following subsection, submit to the Secretaryof State reports with respect to the whole of that part of the United Kingdom &quot; that is, England &quot; either (a) &quot; and we are only concerned with (a) in this case-&quot; showing the constituencies into which they recommend that it shouldbe divided in order to give effect to the rules set. out in the Second Scheduleto this Act,&quot;Pausing there, all that the Boundary Commission could do is to recommendhow England is to be divided in order to give effect to the rules set out inthe Second Schedule. If they do not recommend with a view to and so as tocarry out the rules set out in the Second Schedule, that is not a report whichthey have any authority to make under this Act, and the report itself, in mysubmission, is null and void. Unless their report is a report of their recommendations to give effect to the rules set out in the Schedule, it is not
a report under the Act at all. Then we come on and we find in Subsection (2):&quot; Reports under the last foregoing Subsection shall be submitted . . . ,&quot; andthat merely deals with the times.The Master of the Rolls: The times?Sir Andrew Clark: The times when the report is to be made. I think can go to Subsection (5): &quot; As soon as may be after a Boundary Commis-sion have submitted a report to the Secretary of State under this Act&quot; that must be a report giving effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule,because that is the only report they can submit, so it must read: &quot; As soonas may be after a Boundary Commission have submitted a report setting out their recommendations to give effect to the rules set out in the Second Scheduleto the Act . . . .&quot; They cannot submit any other report. It has to be areport for giving effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule. &quot; As soonas may be after they have submitted such a report to the Secretary of Stateunder this Act he shall lay the report before Parliament&quot; that again has tobe a report which conforms to the rules &quot; together &quot; and I can leave outthe next three lines &quot; with the draft of an Order in Council for giving effect,whether with or without modification to the recommendations contained inthe report.&quot; If one looks back to Section 2 (1), those must be recommenda-tions to give effect to the rules set out in the Schedule to the Act, so that theonly draft Order which the Secretary of State has any power to lay beforeParliament at all, in my submission, is the draft Order giving effect to recommendations to carry out the rules in the Second Schedule to the Actand nothing else.  It cannot put any other sort of report in.Then Section 3, Subsection (2): &quot;The draft of any Order in Councillaid before Parliament by the Secretary of State under this Act for giving effect&quot; that must be a report giving effect to the rules in the second schedule &quot; whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations contained in the Report of a Boundary Commission may make provision &quot; there are certain things he can make provision for which are not material,for things incidental thereto. Then Subsection (4) &quot; If any such draft is approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, the Secretary of state shall submit it to His Majesty in Council &quot; the only draft which is approvedby Resolution of each House is a draft of an Order in Council giving effectto recommendations for the purpose of carrying out the Rules in the second schedule to the Act. If the draft is approved in our submission no suchdraft has been approved because it is a draft which does not give effect tothe recommendations set out in the Second Schedule. It is only such a draftgiving effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule that he has any authority either to submit to Parliament or, if approved by Parliament, tosubmit to Her Majesty in Council.Your Lordships have not had your attention directed to the Writ in this action; perhaps I may read to your Lordships from the Writ the relief whichis claimed, because your Lordships have not had your attention drawn tothat. What is asked for first of all is: &quot;A Declaration that the Report ofthe Boundary Commissioners for England dated 10th November, 1954,submitted to the Defendant under the provisions of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, was not made in accordance with and does not comply with the rules set out in the Second Schedule to that Act.and that the said Report is not a &apos; Report under the said Act&apos; within themeaning of Section 2 (5) thereof, (ii) A Declaration that the Defendant is notbound by Section 3 (4) of the said Act to submit, and ought not to submit to Her Majesty in Council a draft Order in Council entitled &apos; draft parliamentary Constituencies (Manchester, Oldham and Ashton-under-Lyne)Order, 1954,&apos; giving effect to the recommendations contained in the said
Report,&quot; then an injunction to restrain the Defendant from submitting that particular draft Order in Council to Her Majesty, because we say that draft Order in Council is not a draft Order in Council which there was any authority under the Act to submit to her Majesty. There is no suggestionhere that the Secretary of State is submitting an Order in Council to her majesty in his office as Secretary of State and as a servant of the Crown;he is submitting it simply under the statutory directions in this particularAct of Parliament. It is limited to that particular type of report; it has got to be a report which gives effect to the rules set out in the second schedule.   .If I may turn to the Rules in the Second Schedule, I make my submissionsto your Lordships as to why this Report does not conform to them. your lordships will see that the first Rule is that: &quot; The number of constituencies in the several parts of the United Kingdom .... shall be as stated &quot; below.One finds first of all that for Great Britain it is to be not substantially greater or less than 613, Scotland not less than 71, Wales not less than 35, so you have a fixed minimum for both Scotland and Wales, and Northern ireland is fixed at 12, and what one might call a cushioning figure for Great britain as a whole which allows of some latitude; it is not to be substantially greater or less than 613. What is substantially greater or substantially less is nodoubt a matter on which there might be varying views, but the one thing that is clear here is that it is not a fixed figure; it has not got to be anyfixed figure, because that is where the whole latitude comes in. There is nolatitude to go beyond 71 for Scotland; there is no latitude to go beyond35 for Wales, and therefore the adjustments, when you have got those two,have all got to come in in England, so one has to find how many are left for England.In fact what was done was that the Boundary Commission for Englandascertained that the recommendation for Wales was going to be 36 and thatScotland was going to remain at 71, and that therefore it left 506 for England.It did not leave 506, of course, it meant that if you were going to get exactly the figure of 613, that would be 506 English seats. But that is a cushioningfigure; there is in my submission a wide discretion and that is where all theother discrepancies have, to be made up, on that figure.When one comes to look at the next, we need not trouble with Rules 2and 3, Rule 4 says: &quot;1. So far as is practicable having regard to theforegoing rules&quot; that of course would apply specially to Scotland andWales where they have a minimum number of seats and to some extent toEngland, but not so much to England because they have a variable figure for England and Wales &quot; (i) no County or any part thereof shall beincluded in a constituency which includes the whole or part of any otherCounty or the whole or part of a County Borough or Metropolitan Borough;(ii) No County Borough or any part thereof shall be included in a constituencywhich includes the whole or part of any other County Borough or the wholeor part of a Metropolitan Borough.&quot; We are complaining of both (i) and(ii) there because we are saying here not merely that one voter has beentransferred from one constituency to another, but that one of the Plaintiffsnow finds himself in a constituency which is half of one County Boroughand half of another County Borough, and they are split between the two.Lord Justice Jenkins: Who are the judges of what is practicable?Sir Andrew Clark: The Commission, my Lord.Lord Justice Jenkins: Are those things going to be held up every timebecause somebody who is dissatisfied thinks it would have been practicable to treat him differently?
Sir Andrew Clark: No, my Lord, it is more fundamental than that. Ijust pointed that out as saying it is one of the things.Lord Justice Jenkins : Under Section 4 (1) (a), you are aggrieved under (i).Sir Andrew Clark : Yes, I am aggrieved under (i); I am aggrieved because i am transferred to a new constituency.The Master of the Rolls.: Merely the effect of being transferred to a newconstituency is per se no breach at all; you cannot say you are aggrievedmerely because you are transferred from one constituency to another.Sir Andrew Clark : I am aggrieved because my right of franchise has beeninterfered with.The Master of the Rolls: Some rights of franchise were involved in theAct; he cannot simply say: &quot; I was a voter in Gorton and that of itself &quot;-Sir Andrew Clark : Of course, my Lord, the Act gives the right to interferewith my right of franchise. What I am saying is that so long as the Actis legally valid, I cannot be heard to complain, but if my franchise has beeninterfered with by a procedure which is not authorised by the Act, then I cancomplain. I say my right of franchise has been interfered with by a procedure which does not conform with the requirements of the Act, therefore I cancomplain because one of my clients has been put into a constituency, because in his own constituency he was &quot;one of 54,000, and in his new constituencyhe is one of 62,000 voters so his vote is by that much less valuable, just asa man who takes a ticket in a lottery, if there are 50,000 tickets sold, has abetter chance of winning than if there are 60,000 tickets sold, the value of hischance has been interfered with.The Master of the Rolls: You are saying under Section 4 (1) (a)-Sir Andrew Clark: I accept at once that is one which is subject to theforegoing rules, is one which is variable. What we submit is really the cardinal principle of these rules is Rule 5: &quot; The electorate of any constituencyshall be as near the electoral quota as is practicable having regard to theforegoing rules; and a Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last foregoing rale &quot;-that is Rule 4 &quot; if it appearsto them that a departure is desirable to avoid an excessive disparity betweenthe electorate of any constituency and the electoral quota, or between the electorate thereof and that of neighbouring constituencies in the part of theUnited Kingdom with which they are concerned.&quot; Rule 5 says this: &quot; the electorate of any constituency is to be as near to the electoral quota as is practicable &quot;; that overrides Rule 4, because we have got a provision that where Rule 4 conflicts with that, Rule 4 is to give way to Rule 5. So Rule 5has precedence over Rule 4,&quot; and the only thing which could be said in anyway to make it not practicable to make an exact electoral quota is theprovisions of Rule 1 which is that it applies, one can see at once, to Scotland,because there they are to have a minimum of 71 seats and Wales a minimum of 35.Therefore that is an overriding requirement, they have got to have atleast those, and in those two cases, of course, the electorate of the constituencycould not be the same as the electoral quota, because they are fixed. So, inour submission, it is really only those two that can come in, because thereis no practical difficulty in making the electoral quota the same as the electorate of the constituency so far as England is concerned, because theonly thing that it is subject to, if anything, is that rather vague and generalcushion that the total number of seats are not to be substantially greater or4947418 e
h*0\less than 613. The whole of the effect of the words &quot; so far as practicablehaving regard to the foregoing Rules &quot; is amply exhausted, in our submission,by the requirements of Scotland and Wales.Lord Justice Jenkins: What do you make of the next bit, &quot; and aBoundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last foregoing rule if it appears to them that a departure is desirable to avoidan excessive disparity between the electorate of any constituency and the electoral quota.&quot; Surely all these Rules are framed so as to give them a very wide discretion within some broad, general principles?Sir Andrew Clark: In our submission, it is quite practicable, and it is:as far as practicable the electorate of any constituency is to be the same asthe electoral quota.Lord Justice Jenkins : It is, only: &quot; having regard to the foregoing rules.&quot;It still leaves them free to put what weight they like on Rule 5.Sir Andrew Clark: The first Rule is a sliding cushion; the second rule is expressly overruled by the following part of Rule 5. Then if I may go on,Rule 6: &quot;A Boundary Commission may depart from the strict applicationof the last two foregoing rules &quot; this is the only one in which they are authorised to depart from Rule 5 really, in my submission &quot; if specialgeographical considerations .... render a departure desirable.&quot; There isno suggestion that that arises, in this case. Now we come to the vital point,and that is rule 7, which is quite inflexible and mandatory; there is no question about Rule 7: &quot; The expression &apos; electoral quota &apos; means (i) in the applicationof these rules to a constituency in Great Britain, a number obtained bydividing the electorate for Great Britain by the number of constituencies inGreat Britain existing on the enumeration date.&quot;The Master of the Rolls: How does that help you, merely defining cheterm: &quot; The electorate .... shall be as near the electoral quota as is practicable &quot;?Sir A ndrew Clark: You have got first of all to ascertain your electoral quota. Having ascertained your electoral quota, in our submission underRule 5 the correct procedure is then to say, having got the electoral quota,then how many seats do I need in order to get the electoral quota as theaverage of each of these seats, and if that had been done, it would havegiven 519 seats for England, or a total of 626 for Great Britain, and thatthey should have proceeded by ascertaining the electoral quota, then saying:how many seats do we require? and the answer would have been 626 forGreat Britain, or 519 for England. Having got the 519 seats for England,that would hot have been substantially greater, 626, than 613. No-one would suggest that was substantially greater, and having got that ....The Master of the Rolls: What do you say nobody would suggest that626 was substantially greater than 613?Sir Andrew Clark:   Not substantially greater; it is a question  ofwhat ....The Master of the Rolls: You say so, but again it seems to me, who isto determine it is, the Courts?Sir Andrew Clark: One has got these conflicting things; the electoral quota has got to be determined in a certain way, then you have got to getthe electorate as near as practicable to it, and as near as practicable havingregard to the fact that some other figure is not to be substantially greater.   I
should have submitted that the first thing you have got to do is to get yourelectoral quota, find how many seats you require, and then see whether thatmade it substantially greater or not.Lord Justice Jenkins: Look what they said in Paragraph 9 of theirReport; they said: &quot; Our aim was to create 506 constituencies, each of whichwould be at or near the electoral quota, without cutting across local govern-ment boundaries.&quot; They are saying in another way: we are making it asnear the electoral quota as is practicable, having regard to the Rules aboutcutting across electoral boundaries, and so on.Sir Andrew Clark: May I look at the Report. Where I say they wentwrong was in Paragraph 8; this is the fundamental error in the Report, andit is me last six lines of Paragraph 8 : &quot; We thus proceeded on the basis thatthe number of constituencies available for distribution in England was to benot substantially greater or less than 506.&quot;Lord Justice Jenkins: Is that wrong or right? It must be right, mustnot it?Sir Andrew Clark : Yes, my Lord, that is quite true, but that was not the cardinal provision, however, they started with that.The Master of the Rolls: You talked about Rule 1 being flexible, I donot know whether that is the adjective, but you will observe that Rules 1, 2and 3 have got precedence over the later Rules, because Rule 4 is &quot; So far asis practicable having regard to the foregoing rules,&quot; and Rule 5 is again,having got the foregoing Rules, a departure in 5 and 6 is only from 4 and 5,so that they were right in saying, surely, the important thing is 506? &quot;Wehave not got to go substantially above or below that.&quot;Sir Andrew Clark : May I point out with respect, my Lord, that in Rule 1you have three things that are inflexible, and one that is flexible.The Master of the Rolls: I agree, the figure is what you call a cushionfigure, but Rule 1 has primacy, as far as I can see, over the other rules.Sir Andrew Clark : I quite appreciate that.The Master of the Rolls: It is inevitable.Sir Andrew Clark : Except when your Lordship goes down to Rule 5, your lordship finds: &quot;The electorate .... shall be as near the electoral quotaas is practicable.&quot;The Master of the Rolls : &quot; Having regard to the foregoing rules,&quot; it thengoes on to say,, &quot;and a Boundary Commission may depart from &quot; Rule 4.Sir Andrew Clark: It all turns on the word &quot;substantially.&quot; Then if Imay read in the Report: &quot; We thus proceeded on the basis that the numberof constituencies available for distribution in England was to be not substantially greater or less than 506, and we allocated seats provisionally to administrative Counties with their associated County Boroughs on the basisof 1 seat for each complete unit of electors &quot; that is a new thing which comesin altogether; that is the unit of electors; that is nothing to do with an electoral quota.Lord Justice Jenkins : Look at the figures, 57,122.Sir Andrew Clark: &quot;The unit representing the average electorate inEngland, namely 57,122, determined by dividing the total English electorate,namely 28,904,108 by 506&quot;.
The. Master of the Rolls: What they say surely is this: we have-been told by Parliament not to be substantially more or less&quot; than &quot;506. &quot;Ourfkstcalculation was, since it is 506, then seeing there are 28,900,000 voters,that would mean that on the basis of Rule 2, each constituency returninga single member,-you get theoretically &quot;57,122 electors per member ofParliament. That was pur provisional idea, and quite obviously that couldnot be done in practice;, then they say what their aim really was.Sir Andrew. Clark; That is exactly what they did do; that is where wesubmit they go wrong, because we say they have taken this 506 as thoughit was a fixed figure, and they have in fact worked out their own electoral quota at 57,122.        ..... , ., :: V,.Lord Justice Jenkins: That is not a bad shot; 55,170 was the.actual one for Great Britain. &apos;. ;&apos;.. I..... ....Sir Andrew. Clfark;, Wje.. say jit.js a. very great, difference; it would havemade a difference of: an additional, 13 seats; it would have required-13 moreseats. : .&apos;&quot;     i,: .The Master of the Rolls : They go on: &quot; Our aim was, having formed thisview.&quot;.:..&apos;...&apos; ..  -.:&apos;&apos;.&apos;v:;^&quot;&apos;.. !* \     i       - * ;Sir Andrew Clark : &quot; Our aim was to create 506 constituencies.&quot; In mysubmission that is wrong, because their aim ought not be to create 506constituencies; their aim was to create such number of constituencies asshall be necessary to.give an average of the electoral quota.The Master of the Rolls: They arrived at 511 in the end.Sir Andrew Clark: Yes, they say: &quot;Our aim was to create 506constituencies each of which would be at or near the electoral quota withoutcutting across local government. boundaries.&quot; Of course, they could not do that, because they would not have this electoral quota if there were 506;the electoral quota would have required 519, therefore we say they wentwrong by starting off, as their aim, to create 506 constituencies; they oughtto have taken 519 constituencies, and then seen whether they thought itnecessary to cut those down at all if they felt that was substantially greaterthan the 506.The Master of the Rolls: I have great difficulty in following you;however, I hear what you say.&apos;: Sir Andrew Clark : That is the submissions that we make on it, that theyproceeded by taking the fixed number of seats for England as 506 as the guiding factor, whereas what they ought to have taken was the number of seats necessary to give an average, of the electoral quota properly ascertained.Had they taken that; they&apos; would haye; got an additional number; of seats.They would have had &quot;more seats; it would not be necessary,- as they did.to abolish one of the.seats in Manchester, and. one of the seats outside, and: to mix the manchester Borough seats with the county outside, and none, ofthese changes would -have been necessary which have prejudiced our clients,and we submit they approached it the wrong way under this Report.: That is my submission on the Report,&apos; if your Lordships come to theconclusion that there is nothing in that and it is all. within their discretion,men ifis a pure question of construction,- it is not a matter I can cite any authority On. It is not a matter I can argue at any great length. I havemade my submissions to your Lordships, and if your Lordships say: wethink they have done their duty; and that is an end of the matter.
&amp;Lord. Justice Hodson: I do not understand the learned Judge&apos;judgment at page 5 on this. Is there a &quot; not&quot; left out, or does he mean what he appears to say?Sir Andrew Clark : &quot; It is perfectly clear that there is an overridingprovision in Rule 1 that the allocation of seats to Great Britain, excludingNorthern Ireland, was not to be substantially greater or less than 613,but I think that it would be difficult to say that 626 was substantially greater or less than 613, and therefore it would appear to me that the Boundary-Commission ought to have approached the problem in accordance with theRules along those lines and then, of course, applied the geographicalconsiderations &quot; his Lordship is saying what I have just submitted to your lordships.  He is saying there if they had taken the electoral quota.Lord Justice Hodson: They would have arrived at this figure of 626.and they ought to have started at that end.Sir Andrew Clark: They ought to have started at that end; he acceptedmy argument, which I submitted to him, which I just submitted to your lordships.Lord Justice Jenkins: That was the only way of working these rules and any other way was ultra vires and a nullity and not under the Act at all.Sir Andrew Clark: That is my submission to your Lordships.Lord Justice Jenkins: My trouble is that there may be more ways thanone of complying with general rules of this sort. However, each method of starting has its own difficulties, and disadvantages, and the commission have to do the best they can to produce a workable result.Sir Andrew Clark: I feel the greatest possible force in your Lordship&apos;scomment; no doubt there may be more ways than one. I am making mysubmission to your Lordships that here the way they have adopted was not one of the legitimate ways.Lord Justice Jenkins: You say it goes beyond the legitimate?Sir Andrew Clark: I do see the weight of your Lordship&apos;s point; 1appreciate it very fully. I do very fully appreciate it, but my submission to your Lordships here is that this way they have done it is not one of thosewhich are sufficiently near to be a possible way of doing it, and it has reached a very unfortunate result, and one which has caused damage to the Plaintiffs.My submission to your Lordships on this is that they were bound to takethe electoral quota which they in fact entirely ignored, except having realised that they have ignored it, they put it in, to try and show that they have notgone so very wrong after all. They put it in at the end of Paragraph 10merely as a check to try and show they have not got so very wrong. they say: &quot; Thus 410 constituencies or more than 80 per cent, of the whole fall within the range, 45,000 to 65,000 of which the electoral quota (55,670) fallswithin the range.&quot; In my submission you have only got to look at Para-graph 10 and see that some constituencies fall as low as 40,000 and someas high as 80,000 to see this has gone very wrong when they are told toget as near as practicable to the electoral quota, which is 55,000, and youfind some of them have gone 25,000 over and some of them have gone 15,000below, which is not a very satisfactory result. They have only used the true electoral quota in brackets at the end to try and excuse themselves for not having done it in that strict way, and to try and show that they have not really done anything substantially wrong. Of course, the key to it all comes from the fact, as became apparent in Mr. Attorney&apos;s opening, that what5347418 F
happened was that there was-a-previous Act, the 1944 Act,&apos;which was-quite different: -&apos; &apos;Tfie&apos; &apos;&amp;M &quot;Act&apos; talked&quot; of getting Within 25- per cent.vThe Attorney-General: If I may help my learned friend/on that, the 1944Act contained a provision, as appears from the first report of the boundary commission, Parliament had amended it by- deleting that provision: before they made their report of 1947. I did not bother your Lordships with-that;it does appear from the Report; I can draw your Lordships&apos; and- mylearned friend&apos;s attention to it. Therefore the 1944 Act as amended was almost precisely similar in its rules to the rules of the 1949 Act.Sir Andrew Clark: They made a Report under that Act; that Report forsome reason was never adopted. It does not matter what the purpose was.The Act was. repealed, and. now. we get a new Act and a different wording,at any rate, from what the old Act was. Under, the new Act they proceededin exactly the same way as where Mr. Attorney read their previous Report.They proceeded on the. old:&apos;procedure which: was; dropped before, we do not know Why, and the &quot;Report never.-: took: effect. . They proceeded under adifferent Act in the same manner.y-The Attorney-General ? I do: not know if F can help my learned friend,it is riot quite accurate to say that that Report did: not take effect.. It did take effect in certain respects; its recommendations were embodied to a consider-able extent, if not entirely, in a Bill which became an Act plus 17 additionalseats in- addition to their recommendations. The 1949 Act, if I may helpagain on that-, is an Act to consolidate the enactments and, to make permanentprovision. -The Master of the Rolls: Thank you.Sir- Andrew. Clark.:. The Report as a- Report, was never passed inaccordance, with the Act,, and there.was no, Order in Council adopting it. I ask your Lordships, having looked at the Report, to look for one moment atthe Draft Order in Council itself. This is the Draft Order which the Secretaryof State is proposing to lay before: Her Majesty.   It starts off by saying:&quot; Whereas in-: pursuance of Subsection (1) of Section 2. of the. House ofCommons: (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1-949, ;the Boundary Commission for england has submitted to the Secretary, of State a report dated the 10th day-of November- 1954, showing the constituencies into which they recommendthat England should be divided; in- order to give effect to the Rules set out inthe.Second Schedule of the said Act&quot; -we submit that the whole of that isquite untrue,, because, we say that the Report was not made in pursuance ofSection 2, Subsection (1), and wer say that the. Report does not recommend the constituencies into which England could be divided in order to give effectto-the Rules set out in the. Second. Schedule: We say the whole of that recitalis completely erroneous.Then, thereis anotherrecital: that he-has laid the Report before Parliament,then comes: &quot;Now, therefore, Her Majesty, in pursuance of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the House of Commons: (Redistribution of Seats)Act, 1949; is pleased by and with the advice of her Privy Council, to order,and it is hereby ordered, as follows&quot;- so it is quite clear, that the Orderin Council is: made: in: pursuance of Section. 3 of the. Act of 1949 and nothing else, and therefore if the Report is not a- Report within; the meaning of theAct, this authority ought: not to be made, because it is only purported tobe made under- the terms of the Act and- in pursuance: of the Act, nothing to&apos; do; with the Royal! Prerogative- or Her- Majesty&apos;s right, to make Orders inCouncil&apos;.  It is anv Order inv Council under the Act and under the Act only,
and is only made if and insofar as the Act gives power to make it. It.ismade under the power conferred by the Act and nothing else. I can showyour Lordships on the Order exactly how the Plaintiffs were affected.The Master of the Rolls: I assume that from you; we have been told that, both, until this, thing comes into force, are electors in the GortonDivision,, and they will be transferred to some other Division, one will goto Withington.Sir Andrew Clark: And one to Openshaw. Openshaw Divisionincorporated an urban District which we say arose because of the abolitionof the Droylsdon seat which we say would never have been abolished if the correct procedure had been adopted under the- Act,, it would- have beenunnecessary to abolish it because there would have been nine moreconstituencies in hand. I have made my submission on the Act, and I havenot got to satisfy your Lordships, that I am necessarily right, but that Ihave something amounting to at least a. point which ought to be argued,there is sufficient substance, to be argued, and I submit I have shownsomething in the nature of a prima. facie case.If your Lordships are against me on. that, I am only taking your Lordships&apos;time up unnecessarily.The Master of the Rolls: I would like to consult with my Brothers when you have-finished this part of your argument.Sir Andrew Clark: I feel there is: very litde more It can usefully add onthe, question of construction; I have: put it to your Lordships, and on whatwas- done.. I do- not think I can usefully amplify that. If your Lordshipsare, against me: on that, it would not be right that I should take up your lordships&apos; time with authorities whether I can sue the Secretary of State.The Master of the Rolls: This is an interlocutory appeal; we do not normally hear more than one Counsel, but we. inquire from &quot;Mr. Nesbittwhether he. would like to address us. We would certainly consider it as amatter of special privilege.Mr. Nesbitt r My Lords,, I do not: wish to address your Lordships.Sir Andrew Clark: Would your Lordships like me to wait while your lordships consult?The: Master of the Rolls: While we have- a word; we&apos; will let you know:(Their Lordships conferred.)&apos;The Master of the Rolls: Sir Andrew, we have all three reached a clearconclusion upon this- point which is. adverse to your argument.Sir Andrew Clark: Then I feel it would be wrong- that T should troubleyour Lordships to listen&apos; to&apos; me further on the other point. . .The Master of, the Rolls : Thank, you, very much.47418
PART IIIJUDGMENTThe Master of the Rolls: This case comes before us in very unusualcircumstances, and it is right that I should first make clear as a matter ofprocedure what it is that we are being called upon to determine. The Writin the action was issued I think last Friday, the Plaintiffs being twoindividuals, a Mr. Harper and Mr. Lord, who are electors at the moment inone of the Parliamentary Divisions of Manchester. The Defendant as described in the Writ is the Secretary of State for the Home Department.The relief sought in the Writ is, first, a declaration that the Report of the boundary Commissioners dated 10th November, 1954 and submitted to the defendant, that is the Secretary of State, under the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, was not made in accordance with that Act,and was therefore not a Report as stated in that Act. The Writ proceedsto seek a further declaration that the Defendant Secretary of State was hotbound to submit and ought not to submit to Her Majesty in Council a draft order in Council as provided by the Act and then seeks an injunction.The Plaintiffs moved, as I understand, my Brother Roxburgh on Fridaymorning for an . ex parte injunction; and though the learned Judge,apprehending the seriousness of the matter, gave an opportunity so that the defendant could be before him in the afternoon, it was not in fact practicable,as may well be understood, for the Defendant then to be represented by counsel. The Judge accordingly dealt with the matter as an ex parteapplication. He made an Order ex parte restraining the Secretary of Stateuntil after Tuesday (that is to-morrow) or further Order, from presentingto Her Majesty in Council a Draft Order in Council as intimated in the endorsement to the Writ.In the ordinary course the procedure would be. I do not doubt, that ifthe interval before the Motion came on to be heard in the ordinary way were substantial, and if at the same time the Defendant thought on any sufficientground that the ex parte injunction ought not to be continued, then he would apply to discharge the ex parte injunction. In this case, as I have intimated,the ex parte injunction only runs until to-morrow. It might therefore havebeen thought the more natural course to wait until to-morrow in order thatthe learned Judge might hear the Motion inter partes. make a decision, andthen if either party were dissatisfied with that decision, there could be anappeal to this Court. But, as everybody knows, and through no fault ormalice on anybody&apos;s part, this matter has come before the Court very late in the term, and the case being obviously one of substance and some urgency,to put it no higher, it has been thought proper on behalf of the DefendantSecretary of State to come to-day to this Court to appeal against the making of the injunction ex parte.We are therefore only concerned with the question whether that ex parteinjunction was Tightly granted. I think it right to emphasise these proceduralmatters because the course which has been followed and which learnedCounsel, have both thought it right to pursue here is one which owes its existence, owes the fact of its having been followed, to the special circum-stances. particularly as to,time, in. which the Court is now placed. I do not.however, forget that it is only with the ex parte injunction that the Courtis now concerned. Yet if we reach a conclusion that- the. ex parteinjunction should hot have been granted upon grounds which affect the declarations sought in the Writ, it is obvious that, as a practical matter,bur decision is likely to govern what will&apos;hereafter occur on the hearing of the Motion to-morrow and I dare say of the action itself.
After that preamble I turn to some references to the Act of 1949 whichis involved. But, first, it is plain that the form of the action is an unusualone. As I have said, the Defendant is the Secretary of State for the home department, and, as is apparent from the endorsement, what it is sought bythe Plaintiffs to achieve is an injunction to restrain the Secretary of Statefrom presenting to Her Majesty in Council a Draft Order which has already received the approval of both Houses of Parliament. It is therefore obviousthat the Court is concerned with matters which at any rate come somewhatnear to touching upon the relative spheres of Parliament and- the Courts.I shall have something later to say about the Defendant and the name bywhich he is said, &quot;Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; but i will first recite the necessary parts of the 1949 Act.It: was an Act passed to replace an earlier Act, and as I follow it, to consolidate earlier enactments. Its long title is &quot;An Act to consolidate the enactments which make permanent provision for the redistribution of seatsat Parliamentary elections,&quot; etc. The first section established boundary commissions for the four parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain artdNorthern Ireland, namely England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.After stating how those Commissions were to be constituted. Section 2provides: &quot; Each Boundary Commission shall keep under review the representation in the House of Commons of the part of the United kingdom with which they are concerned and shall, in accordance with the nextfollowing subsection, submit to the Secretary of State &quot; meaning therebythe Secretary of State for the Home Department &quot; reports with respect to thewhole of that part of the United Kingdom either &quot; and this is the alternativewe are concerned with &quot; (a) showing the constituencies into which they recommend that it should be divided in order to give effect to the Rulesset out in the Second Schedule to this Act; or &quot;, alternatively, and this hasnot arisen &quot; (ft) stating that, in the opinion of the Commission, no alterationis required. I can pass over the next three subsections, and 90 to Subsection(5) of Section 2: &quot;As soon as may be after a Boundary Commission have submitted a Report to the Secretary of State under this Act, he shall lay theReport before Parliament together, except in a case where the Report statesthat no alteration is required,&quot; etc., &quot;with the draft of an Order in council for giving effect, whether with or without modifications, to the recom-mendations contained in the Report.&quot;Section 3, Subsection (2), provides that &quot; The draft of any Order in Councillaid before Parliament by the Secretary of State under this Act for giving effect, whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations con-tained in the report of a Boundary Commission may make provision (a) forany matters which appear to him to be incidental thereto or consequentialthereon,&quot; and there are certain other provisions, which I need not enumerate.Then Subsection (4) of Section 3 says : &quot; If any such draft is approvedby resolution of each House of Parliament, the Secretary of State shall submititto His Majesty in Council.&quot;Before I pass to the Second Schedule to give effect to the Rules in which,as will be recalled, Section 2 provides that the recommendations be directed,I pause to restate this fact. In the present case, the Secretary of State, hayingreceived the report, to which I shall later advert, laid it before Parliament,together with a draft Order in Council, and each of the Houses of Parliamentapproved that Order in Council. Prima facie, therefore, the Secretary of state must, now submit the draft Order in Council to Her Majesty.. I have, saidthat the case is, therefore, a striking one, coming near at the least to involving the privileges and powers of Parliament; but let me say at once that the Courtshave never been: reluctant or afraid to exercise their powers where, they are.5.7
satisfied that such powers reside in the Courts, and -that some one or more;of the-subjects of Her Majesty are in danger of finding their rights imperilled.come now to the Second Schedule, containing the Rules which are to hethefguide of the Boundary Commission in making and presenting their reports.The Rules in the Second Schedule are described as &quot;Rules for redistribution of seats.&apos;&apos; The first is thus: &quot; The number of constituencies in the severalparts of the United Kingdom set out in the first column of the following tableshall be as stated respectively in the second column of that table.&quot; The first column is headed: &quot; Part of the United Kingdom,&quot; and the second column,&quot;No. of Constituencies.&quot; Then against &quot;Great Britain&quot; you find &quot;not substantially greater or less than 613.&quot; Then: &quot;Scotland .... Not lessthan 71. Wales .... Not less than 35, and Northern Ireland .... 12;&quot;It is convenient to pause in order to say that (Wales having risen to thefigure of 36) from the figure of 613 opposite &quot; Great Britain &quot; you shoulddeduct the figure of 107, so that &apos;in considering the English representationyou may say for practical purposes that the figure is not to be substantially greater nor less than 506.Paragraph 2 says.: &quot;Every constituency shall return a single Member.&quot;Paragraph 3 relates to the City of London. Paragraph 4, or Rule 4, openswith the words: &quot; So far as is practicable having regard to the foregoingrules,&quot; and then there are provisions directing the Commissioners that countiesor parts of counties shall not be included in constituencies which are includedin the whole or parts of other counties.Then there is a rule or paragraph particularly directed to the inter-relations-of parliamentary representations and local government.Rule 5 says: &quot; The electorate of any constituency shall be as near the electoral quota as is practicable having regard to the foregoing rules; and aBoundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last foregoing rule &quot; that is Rule 4 about counties and local governments-&quot; ifit appears to them that a departure is desirable to avoid an excessive disparity between the electorate of any constituency and the electoral quota, or&quot; andthen another alternative is given.Rule -6 is:   &quot;A Boundary Commission may depart from the strict .application of the last two foregoing rules if special geographical considera--tions, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency,appear to them to render a departure desirable.&quot;Then, to complete my reading of the Schedule, the phrase, &quot; electoral quota,&quot; used in Rule 5, is defined to mean so far as Great Britain is concerned,a &quot; number obtained by dividing the electorate for Great Britain by thenumber -of constituencies in Great Britain existing on the enumeration date.&quot;:1 need not take time to state what is meant by &quot;enumeration date.&quot;Before I proceed to consider what bas been done, I venture to draw attention to one feature of these rules which seems to me to be striking,and that isNthat within certain broad lines plainly a -measure of latitude orof discretion is conferred. And it is primarily conferred, I think, upon theCommission. It would be difficult to think of any other way in which sucha body would work. To take examples, you get in the first rule a ;figure&quot; not substantially greater or less.&quot; Then in the fourth rule is the phrase&quot;So far as is practicable having regard to the foregoing rules &quot;; and in the fifth rule it is stated, &quot; The electorate of any constituency shall be as near the electoral quota as is practicable having regard to the foregoing rule,&quot;and &quot;the Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application ofthe last foregoing rule if it appears to them that a departure is desirable toavoid an excessive disparity.&quot;And in Rule 6 again:  &quot; A Boundary Commission may depart -from the strict application&quot; if it appears to them &quot;desirable,&quot; and so forth.
It is, however, a fact that some primacy, is obviously given to the firs,tthree rules; particularly, for example, Scotland&apos;s-representation is to be &quot;notless than 71,&quot; and for Great Britain as a whole the number of constituenciesis not to be substantially greater or less than 613- In Rule 2 again &quot;Everyconstituency -shall &quot; be a single member constituency.v I- turn now to see how the Commission in this case has gone about itstask. The authority for the procedure adopted was stated in paragraph 8.They said that they, were advised that it was unlikely that their oppositenumbers, so to speak, the Boundary Commissions for Scotland and wales should want to add to Scottish and Welsh representation now. I amquoting and they &quot;proceeded on the basis that the number of constituencies available for distribution in England was. to be not substantially greater or less than 506.&quot; Pausing there, it seems impossible to suggestthat the Boundary Commission have done anything so far to which anybodycould take the smallest exception.They then added this sentence, which has brought upon them the criticism of acting outside their proper sphere. They said: &quot;We allocated seatsprovisionally to administrative counties with their associated county boroughson the basis of one seat for each complete unit of electors, the unit representing-the average electorate in England, namely, 57,122, determined by dividing the total English electorate, viz., 28,904,108 by 506.&quot;I will read on: &quot;Our aim was to create 506 constituencies each ofwhich would be at or near the electoral quota without cutting across localgovernment boundaries.&quot; They said that in some cases that would be.easyenough, and then they said that in others it would require special consideration, and in those cases what they had to do was to decide betweendeparture from quota or disregard of boundaries. After considering all those cases accordingly, their recommendation was that they would increase thenumber of constituencies in England from 506 to 511; but they show thattheir final suggested rearrangement was such that in more than 80 per cent,of the whole they did achieve a range of figures of electorate which wasclose to the electoral quota, the electoral quota as defined by the Act being a total of 55,670.Now the challenge to the validity of that Report (for that is what is said,and must be said) is, that in the sentence which I read in Paragraph 8referring to a provisional allocation on the basis of single member constituencies, every unit containing 57,122, there was a misdirection of themselves so fundamental as to disable all the later calculations. It is saidthat what they ought, to &quot;have done was to work out and discover what the electoral quota was (as indeed they did), namely, 55,670, and if by that figure they had divided the total English electorate, 28,900,000 odd, theywould have found out that the arithmetical answer was 519. Sir Andrewsuggests that 519 could not be said to be a Substantial -increase above 506.They should have, therefore, started on the basis that there were going to be519 seats. By placing far too much emphasis on the originating figureof 506 constituencies, says he, they -got the whole thing wrong and have produced a report which so far departs from the authority vested in themthat he, Sir Andrew, can say it is not a report at all.Upon this matter I confess that I have come myself to a clear conclusionthat there is no ground for saying that this Report, as I read it, was sucha substantial departure or was indeed any departure from the rules whichthe Commission had to have in mind. - &quot;The Commission plainly placedemphasis upon Rule 1, that the number of English seats was to be not substantially greater or less than 613 minus the Scottish and Welsh; and upon the Rule that they were-to be single member constituencies. Whatthey proceeded to do was to say that, if ^evefy constituency was-ideally
such that you-had one member: for an equal number of electors, then you would have 506 constituencies of 57,000 odd each; but they also said that what they aimed to do was to create 506i constituencies having a numberof electors &apos; as near as possible to the. electoral quota, and, that ;beingimpossible, then they had to decide according to their discretion-whetherthe quota*should giveaway to boundaries or vice versa. The whole, methodwas exposed upon the face of the Report, and, if the method they adoptedwas one which Parliament ;itself did not like,. it no doubt would have,modified or rejected it. -v i*i . . ,-. :f am, 1 am afraid, quite unable to accept, with all respect to him, theview which -commended itself to Mr. Justice Roxburgh, He said : &quot; It isperfectly true that there: is ah over-riding provision in Rule 1 that-theallocation of seats -to Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, was not tobe substantially greater or less than 613, but I think that it would be difficultto say that 626 &quot;--and that, of course, is the same figure, with the scottish and Welsh &quot;constituencies put in, as the 519 that T mentioned earlier-&quot; was substantially greater or less than 613, and therefore it would appear.to methat the Boundary Commission ought to have approached the problem inaccordance with the rule along those lines.&quot;&quot;My reading of these rules and of the whole Act is that it was quite clearly intended that, in so far as the matter is not within the discretion ofthe Commission, it was certainly to be a matter for Parliament to determine.1 find it impossible to suppose that Parliament contemplated that upon anyof &quot;these occasions when reports were presented it would be competent forthe Court to determine and pronounce upon whether a particular line whichhad commended itself to the Comissioners was one which the Court thought the best line or the right line-none thing rather than another to be regardedas practicable, arid so on: If it were competent for the Courts to passjudgments of that kind before the Reports, I am at a loss to see where theprocess would end and what the function of Parliament would turn out to be.- If &quot;that is the fight view; then, as I think, everything-else follows. SirAndrew indeed conceded that, unless you could say that the report wasvitiated by misdirection of themselves by the Commissioners so as to be ineffect no &quot;report at- all, then His cause of action was in limine destroyed. Ifind ;it unnecessary to say what the Court would say or should do if theCoriimissidh&quot;upon the &quot;face of a report&quot; made recommendations which weremanifestly in complete disregard of the, 1949 Act and of the rules thereunder.1 find it:difficult to think that-Parliament would pass them by unnoticed; but,if Parliament none the less adopted them, I find it unnecessary to say whatview the court might take. 1In another case, arising.. out of. the same report, which came before mr., Justice Hafmariy he used this launguage. I should point out that in this case the remedy sought by representatives of certain-other constituencies was against: the Boundary Cornmission itself, not :the Home Secretary; but thelearned jiidge said::&apos;..&quot; This is not a matter in which 1 ought to be asked tointerfere or in.which any good purpose would be served byirriy.seeking to doso. I dp not think questions of jurisdiction really need be debated at this,stageVr: I shall. a&quot;ssume,,that I can, if necessary, express an opinion as to the.proceedings of the Boundary Commission, without going beyond the functionsof this Court, but I am satisfied that I should.certainly serve hp.useful&quot;objectbyTdoing-so, and that the^hiachinery set up under-this Act does not leave anyroom which makes it appropriate for the Court, to intervene either, at this or at any other stage.&quot;;y;..I must say that I find.myself in,agreement with the view that obviouslycommended itself to Mr. Justice Harmari.     - - . ,- -   : -:.-.rd;i?/-
Sir Andrew referred-us to one.or two cases, and upon those I ought tosay one or two words.. In the case of The King v. Electricity Commissioners,reported in 1924, 1 King&apos;s Bench Division, page 171; the Court granted awrit of prohibition.or mandamus &quot;against the Electricity. Commissioners. Butin that&quot;case what the Electricity Commissioners .were.&apos;told to do was toprepare certain schemes which would become orders, upon their confirmationfirst by the Minister: and later by the resolution, of Jthe House. They would always be the orders of the Commissioners, and the Act which imposed on them the duty of making these schemes plainly imposed on them quasijudicial functions. In that case it was. discovered,that, whilst they were proceeding and before they had reached the stage of preparing and presentingan order, they had gone altogether outside the functions which were committed to them by Parliament. : Lord Justice Atkin at page 210 said:&quot; If the above construction of the Act is correct the Electricity Commissionersare themselves exceeding the limits imposed upon them by the Legislature,and so far from seeking to diminish the authority of Parliament we areperforming the ordinary duty of the Courts in upholding the enactmentswhich it has passed.&quot; &apos;\: -:-Lord Justice Younger, at page 212 said: &quot;That Act in my judgmentcontemplates that the Commissioners&apos; order, which when approved by aresolution passed by each House of Parliament, is to have effect as if enacted in the Act, embodies only a scheme which under the Act the Commissionersare given power either to approve or formulate. Every scheme under theAct remains the scheme of the Commissioners even after it is confirmed &quot; andso forth. Both Lord Justice Younger and Lord Justice Atkin (in an earlierpassage, particularly at the bottom of page 207 onwards) had observed thatthe Commissioners were given limited quasi judicial functions, and that ithad been established that the Commissioners had exceeded those functions.If the Boundary Commission had been given similar functions, and if it had become manifest at some stage or on any occasion that they were exceedingthem, it might well be that the Court would think it right to make a pre-rogative order of prohibition or mandamus to compel them to perform their,functions properly. I observe that Lord Justice Atkin forebore fromexpressing any view as to what the Court would do if, notwithstanding,Parliament had in fact approved the order which the Commissioners hadbeen restrained from proceeding to make; . 1The other case to which Sir Andrew referred was that of the Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Trethowdn, reported in 1932 Appeal Cases,for the purpose of showing that the Court will in appropriate cases grantinjunctions and grant them ex parte to prevent someone in the position of a minister from taking a Bill or Order, whatever it might be, to the Sovereignor the Sovereign^ representative for the purpose of its.becoming law. Butthat was a case where the legislature concerned, namely, the legislature ofNew South Wales, had under the Australian Constitution strictly limitedlegislative functions, and, it having been shown that the proposed Act ofParliament had disregarded the provision in the Constitution Which requirerja particular sanction on the part of the electorate; the Courts in Australia(and the Privy Council here affirmed them) restrained members of theLegislative Council, other than the plaintiffs who Were suing, from proceeding to take the measure for the approval of the&apos; Governor-General; That seemsto me quite a different case from - the present. We are in no sense hereconcerned with a Parliament of legislature having limited legislative functionsaccording to the Constitution..1 -have, therefore, not thought that those two cases carry Sir Andrew anyfurther on his road.  The Attorney-General said that, apart from the question
of the. effect of the report and the proposed Order in Council, the courts in any case had no more power to grant the injunctions against the Secretaryof State than they would have to prevent a Minister, or whoever are the other appropriate persons concerned, from taking to the Sovereign a Bill that hasduly, passed its third reading in each of the two Houses for the Royal assent;and ,a reference was. made by him to the case of The Queen v. The Lords&apos;Commissioners of the Treasury. I do not find it necessary to express anyview upon that broad proposition, save to say that in my judgment the caseof The Queen v. The Lords&apos; Commissioners of the Treasury, reported in. Queen&apos;s Bench Cases, at.page 378, seems to me to be of a wholly different character from the case with which we are now concerned.. But I return at the end of my judgment to the point which I mentionedearlier, and upon which I would say one final word, namely, the question ofthe defendant to this action. I have said that the defendant is &quot; the Secretaryof State for the Home Department&quot; sued, that is to say, by his official titleas a Minister of the. Crown. It is said by Sir Andrew that, since the reportdisregarded the rules in the Act of -1949, therefore it is not a report withinthe meaning of the Act, and that the Secretary of State has.neither the duty to the House or to any one else, nor the power or authority to take this proposed Order in Council to; Her Majesty. I am not myself satisfied that sir Andrew.is not in this respect upon the horns of a dilemma. If the wholething is a nullity, and all he seeks to do is to restrain a particular individual,who happens at the moment to be the Secretary of State for the home department, I am not satisfied -that he ought not to sue him in his personal capacity as for an ordinary wrong-though in that case it would not be cleartome what breach of duty to the plaintiffs he was engaged upon committing.On the other hand, if he does sue him, and rightly sues him, in his capacity .as Secretary of State for the Home Department, then I am not satisfied, though I express no final view upon it, as we have not heard.fullargument, that the case is one which, having regard to the terms of The CrownProceedings Act, 1:947, will lie. And I am not satisfied, having regard to section 21 of that Act, that upon this alternative the plaintiff could in any event obtain an injunction; but I find it unnecessary to do more than mention that caution upon this point, for, in my judgment, the answer to this case isthat the plaintiffs have not established a prima facie case to my satisfaction that the report which was presented and which has formed the basis of allthat subsequently happened was otherwise than in, accordance with the powersvested in the Boundary Commission; and more particularly that theresolutions which the Houses of Parliament passed under which the Secretaryof State has acted and is purporting&apos;to act contained in them, so to speak,any infection of inyalidity.Therefore, I think that this&apos; ex parte injunction ought not to have beengranted and I would allow the appeal against it.Lord Justice Jenkins: I agree and find nothing that I can usefully add to the reasons my Lord has.given for holding that this appeal should beallowed.Lord Justice :Hods6n:. 1 also, agree.The Attorney-General: I ask for an order that the ex parte injunctiongranted by Mr. Justice Roxburgh should be discharged, and I also ask forCOStS. V &apos;   ;&apos;;.:-:&apos;. V :.-.: The Master of the Rolls:: What about costs, Sir Andrew?Sir Andrew Clark: 1 cannot resist costs before your Lordship. 1The Master of the Rolls:: I You areorily/asking for costs in this court? &apos;
The Attorney-General: Yes; in the Court below it was -ex tpfrtfii.The Master of the Rolls: The costs in this Court.Sir Andrew Clark: I cannot resist that, the^costs ofthis application.   .The Master of the Rolls: It may or may not start all over again to-morrowmorning.The Attorney-General: One hopes not. ......APPENDIX -JUDGMENTMr. Justice Roxburgh: By Section 2 of the House of Commons (Redistfi-bution of Seats) Act, 1949, hereinafter called the Act, it is provided that,&quot;Each Boundary Commission &quot; and we are here concerned with the-EnglishBoundary Commission &quot; shall -keep under review the representation in theHouse of Commons of the part of the United -Kingdom with which they areconcerned&quot; that is to say, England-&apos;&quot; and shall, in accordance with-thenext following subsection, submit to the Secretary of State reports with respectto the whole of that part of the United Kingdom, either --(a) showing the constituencies into which they recommend that it should be divided in order &quot; and these are very important words &quot; to give effect to the rules set out inthe Second Schedule to this Act; or (b) &quot;and this did not happen-&quot; statingthat, in the opinion of the Commission, no alteration is required.&quot;Subsection (5) provides: &quot; As soon as may be after a Boundary Commis-sion have submitted a report to the Secretary of State under this Act &quot;-andthose are&apos; three important words ;&quot; he shall lay the report before Parliamenttogether, except in a case where the report states that no alteration isrequired to be made in respect of the part of the United Kingdom with whichthe Commission is concerned, with the draft of an Order in Council for giving effect, whether with or without modifications, to the recommendations contained in the report.&quot;Subsection (4) of Section 3 is : &quot; If any such draft is approved by resolution of each House &quot;&apos;pf Parliament, the Secretary of State shall submit it to HisMajesty in Council&quot; this was 1949-and Subsection (7) of &quot;Section 3 is::&quot; The validity of any Order in Council purporting to be made under this Actand reciting that a draft thereof has been approved by resolution of each house of Parliament shall not be called in question in any legal proceedingswhatsoever.&quot;     \Now it would be a work of supererogation to mention that the boundary commission has reported, that the Secretary of State did lay the draft of anOrder in Council before Parliament, and that it has been approved -by resolution of each House of Parliament. If therefore it is a draft whichcomplies with the&apos;requisites of the Act it is the duty of the Secretary -tosubmit it to Her Majesty, and if he does, and if Her Majesty makes an &quot;orderin the terms of the draft then it cannot be called in question in any legal proceedings whatever. -  --I from that derive certain general conclusions. One -is that it was contemplated that this procedure would be subject to the jurisdiction of theCourts until Her Majesty had made an Order in Council. Nobody doubtsthat Parliament is supreme, and that Parliament can repeal or enact any law,but it can only do that by passing an enactment. This is a species of /delegated legislation, and I think it appears from the form of the Act-itsetf that it/was
intended that&quot; the Courts should intervene in-a proper case up to the timewhen Her Majesty made ah Order in Council. .......Secondly, it appears to me that the Secretary of State, if and when hesubmits a draft Order to Her Majesty in Council, is not doing it in his general capacity as Secretary of State, but is doing it as a person to whomthe duty of so doing is expressly delegated by the provisions of this Act which contains the machinery which is to be used. I do not as at present advisedthink that the Crown Proceedings Act has any bearing on the present case.If I am wrong in this conclusion I hope to be excused m the light of the factthat it is now 5 -30p.ni., and in the light of certain other facts to which I shallshortly be referring.Now it seems to me that there is not the least doubt that the Secretaryof State is not entitled under this Act to do anything unless and until the boundary Commission have submitted a report to the Secretary of Stateunder this Act, and I do not think that that empowers them to submit any sort of report that they feel inclined to submit. I think that that means areport at which they have arrived in compliance with the duty entrusted tothem by this Act, and that was to give effect to the rules set out in the second schedule of the Act, and it would seem to me that if anybody had intervened(in the manner in which the publication of these things was made earlyintervention would have been extraordinarily difficult) at;, a very early stageit might have been possible to prevent the Secretary of State from ever laying the report before Parliament.However, that is a thing of the past, and. whatever may be thought of my judgment I no longer feel that I am in any danger of running into conflict with Parliamentary privilege, and that at least.has somewhat eased my mind.Nobody, of course, would contend that a resolution of each House ofParliament could of itself amount to an enactment, and therefore it cannotbe said that the fact that each House of Parliament has approved the draft inquestion gives it legislative effect. It is but one step in the machinery whichis necessary to give it legislative effect.Now, in Section 3 Subsection (4) the words &quot; If any such draft&quot; referback to the draft which is to give effect to the recommendations of a report made &quot; under this Act,&quot; and accordingly I arrive at the conclusion that ifthe report was not made under this Act then a draft of an Order to giveeffect to the report would not be a proper draft of an order within the meaning of Subsection (5) of Section 2. Therefore, it would not be a draft which it wasproper for the Secretary of State to lay before Her Majesty in Council underSection 3 Subsection (4), and that this conclusion could not be affected bythe fact that it had been approved by resolutions of both Houses because,as I said, that per se could not be substituted for passing enactments.Therefore^ the next question to consider is whether or not the Reportdid give effect to the: rules set out in the Second Schedule to the Act. Thereis certainly a prima facie case that it did not. I need not at this late hourread all the rules, but the dominant consideration. is the electoral quota.The method of ascertainment of that is indicated in Paragraph 7 of theSecond Schedule, and if those instructions are carried out a figure of 55,670is arrived at. The.next thing which they had to do, as I understand it, wasto divide the total electorate of Great Britain (and &quot;Great Britain&quot; meansEngland, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland for this purpose) bythe electoral quota which I have already mentioned.... If that calculation iscarried but the resultant figure is 626 and if you then deduct the seatsrequired for Scotland and Wales you get a result of 519 seats for England.It is perfectly true that there is an over-riding provision in Rule 1 thatthe allocation of seats to Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, was notto be substantially greater or less than 613, but I think that it would be
difficult to say that 626 was. substantially greater, or less than 613. andtherefore it would appear to me that the Boundary Commission ought tohave approached the problem in accordance with the rules along those lines and then, of course^ applied the geographical considerations and other considerations.referred to in the rules which I do not at this late hour proposeto investigate. It is quite plain from a reading of the Report that theydid. not approach, the problem along those lines but along the different lines which are there stated: Therefore, I reach the prima facie conclusion thatthe Report Was not a report made to give effect to the rules set out in theSecond Schedule.to the Act and therefore not a report under the Act, andtherefore, not one in respect of which the draft of an Order could properly be. laid before Parliament and that, accordingly, the draft is not such a draftas under Subsection (4) of Section 3 can properly be laid before Her Majesty.I have been much vexed to know what course I ought to lake in thesedifficult circumstances. The motion was opened this morning ex parte.Realising the difficulty of what course I ought to take in a matter of this great importance, I gave special leave to serve Notice of Motion upon theSecretary of State for the Home Department returnable at 2.05 o&apos;clock :this afternoon. The Solicitor-General most courteously appeared,. and ,1 mustsay that I had hoped that.an offer would be made that this Order shouldnot be laid before Her Majesty until, without undue and unreasonable effort,the Court had been able to give the matter full and proper consideration on a motion inter partes. \        ........I do not think there is anybody who could say that there is not a case to be tried here. I can well see that other people may take a different viewfrom mine. That is not the point. I do not think anybody could say thatthere is not a case to be tried. Parliament, in its. wisdom, in this Act hasthought fit to say that nothing can be done by anybody in any Court ofLaw after the Order in Council has been.made. Therefore, for the plaintiffs,it is now or never.What is the position on the other side? Apparently, it will cause someinconvenience if the holding of the Privy Council at which the Order shouldbe submitted is postponed to a day later than next Tuesday. The Solicitor-General offered to postpone the submitting of the Order until Monday.Monday is not a motion day. That would have meant nothing to me ifI had not already got a heavy list of end-of-term fixtures in Chambers,some of which are part-heard. I explained that I should be very willingto hear this case on Tuesday and to continue it until it was concluded,; butthe Solicitor-General did not feel able to agree to that solution. Accordingly.I was faced with this : anybody is entitled to come to the Court for ex parteapplication and as far as I know it is the duty of the Judge to go on sittinguntil he has disposed of it. and that is why I am here at a quarter.to six and I have done so, and if I have not given full weight to every possibleconsideration I trust that everybody will appreciate the circumstances-thatI have just fully elaborated : for the plaintiffs it is now..or never;. for the defendants it seems to be a matter of making an appointment for a furthersession of the Privy Council. What ought I to do in those circumstances?-There is another thing I want to say.: Looked at from one point of view this may be a very small matter. It may be said::-&quot; What can it really matter to Mr. A. [I am not speaking personally of anyone concerned in this case]Whether he votes in one constituency or in another? &quot; But, on the other hand,the Parliamentary vote is a right of property and one very jealously guardedby British subjects and the loss of it orthe transference of it is a matter whichis, quite impossible of estimation in money. ; It does not sound in that sort of consideration at all. ::- KA-v  \
-&apos;&quot;..vOr -Balance    seems to me.&apos;that th^ plaintiffs ought not to. be put) in the; ; -position&apos;that they:&apos;will be but of Court altogether until1 the case which-they    : -have to be tried and1 which they want to have tried has been tried1.  I; do-not for a moment suggest that it has yet been tried5.   These are only mypreliminary ruminations on a most interesting theme, and- accordingly&apos; Ipropose to grant an interim injunction against the Secretary of State to restrain him&apos;from presenting to Her Majesty until the time when E can&apos;, hear the motion any draft Order purporting to be under Section 3 (-3) of the Actor until the Boundary Commission for England have reported in accordancewith the Act.  That I think is the strict legal form though, as I am&apos;only going   -to grant an injunction for a day or two it is obvious that that is a matter ofmerely technical interest.   The next thingT want to say is- until&apos;: when.Sir Andrew dark.: Originally I. asked in my writ for leave to serve: short notice of Motion for Tuesday. It is really a question of how long the solicitor-General will want to be ready.Mr. Justice Roxburgh : He is not here: I think myself that all that I can.do is to grant it over Tuesday and give you leave to serve notice if you need it.   You have already served Notice of Motion?: Sir Andrew Clark: We have served1 the Notice, but the Notice.was for .-05. p.m. to-day.Mr. Justice Roxburgh : You will have to. serve another.- Sir Andrew Clark : It was a Specials; Notice so I shall have to serveanother Notice.  I shall have to serve a short Notice for Tuesday.Mr. Justice Roxburgh: Yes. .... .- Sir Andrew Clark : Then your Lordship will grant the ex parte injunctionover the hearing of that motion, because it may not end off Tuesday?&apos;-7 Mr. Justice Roxburgh : Yes.Sir Andrew Clark : I do not think this motion can be adjourned because there has not-been an appearance.Mr. Justice Roxburgh : No; this, is an ex parte application, i give youleave to serve short Notice of Motion for Tuesday, and I gave you. an ex., parte injunction in the terms I have mentioned over the hearing of the motion.Sir Andrew Clark:: Yes, until judgment on the motion.Ms. Justice Roxburgh : Yes. If it should so. happen that the Solicitor-General finds.it is inconvenient or that his evidence is not ready we shall-haveto-discuss: it in.his.presence.&apos;-&apos;&apos; 5//&apos; Andrew Clark : Yes.Mr. Justice Roxburgh : I do not suppose anybody would relish? the- ideaof a. motion lasting all Tuesday, and Wednesday.Sir Andrew Clark : I&apos; imagine not, my Lord.Mr. Justice Roxburgh :. That is a- question of accommodation.. Mr. Warren (for the Solicitor-General):: Might I make an application to your Lordship?   I have been silent up to now.Mr. Justice Roxburgh : Strictly, you are not before the Court. I will hearwhat your application is.
Mr. Warren: I am instructed that the Attorney-General would wish tomove to discharge the ex parte injunction which your Lordship has justgranted, before Tuesday, to which date the injunction runs. I apprehend thatin ordinary circumstances the Attorney-General might have moved your lordship on Monday. Your Lordship has already stated the inconvenienceof any proceedings of this nature before your Lordship on Monday.Mr. Justice Roxburgh: I am addressing you without prejudice becauseyou are strictly not before the Court but I am prepared to listen to you. Isyour right course not to go to the Court of Appeal? I do not know; I reservethat until the matter comes on. I should have thought that the Court ofAppeal existed to put a Judge right if he has made a mistake. Indeed,sometimes, in a case like this, I may say I am glad there is a Court of Appeal.Mr. Warren: I am not certain that it would not be the proper process to apply to your Lordship to discharge the ex parte injunction and then, if your Lordship turns the Attorney-General down on that point, to go to theCourt of Appeal.Mr. Justice Roxburgh: I am not going to be involved in nonsensicalprocedures. If you have to come to me to discharge the order that is one thing, but the next motion day in any Court, as far as I know, is Tuesday,and of course on Tuesday the order will be, so far as I am concerned, whollyreconsidered. That is always so with an ex parte injunction and I shall on tuesday, if the matter comes back to me, as it were start afresh. I am notat all clear that between now and that date you can come to me to discharge the order. I am certain that you can go to the Court of Appeal and see what happens there. I cannot tell you. So far as I am concerned, I am not going to give any facilities to discharge this order before Tuesday, because i have not got the time to give. It seems to me that if you want to make anapplication there is the Court of Appeal.Mr. Warren : If your Lordship pleases.Sir Andrew Clark: There is one further point: your Lordship&apos;sinjunction applies only to presenting the Draft Order in Council mentionedin the Notice of Motion, that is, the one affecting my clients. There are, asI said, a large number. It must be made clear in the order that it onlyapplies to that one and not to any other.Mr. Justice Roxburgh: Yes.
