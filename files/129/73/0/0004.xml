(55) 410th January, 1955CABINETFOREIGN affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with the opening of the New Year I feel that I should put before my colleaguescertain considerations about the international situation which cause me concern.Europe2. On the most favourable assumption it will be the end of March or earlyApril before the London and Paris Agreements are ratified by all concerned. Wecan be sure that in the interval the Soviets will be active and there are severalunpleasant possibilities.France3. M. Mendes-France is committed to the treaties and is likely to perseverein his efforts to complete ratification. But his is an unpredictable character whichhas aroused mistrust among many Frenchmen, who might otherwise share his views, and among almost all his allies. He certainly does not show much concern for the latter. If therefore he gets into further difficulties, as is likely, he will search for more concessions to help him to get more votes from the French Chamber,and in particular he may be tempted to some form of new commitment in respectof early Russian negotiation.4. This could be mortal. For if we were to embark upon such negotiationbefore ratification is complete, or even before our agreements had begun to enterinto force, the whole future could be jeopardised. It is not understood in thiscountry how narrow a margin of unity we command.5. Last autumn, through a tour of Western Europe and through the london conference, we seized the initiative for the moment. The Russians did not quiteknow what counter-move to make, or when. This applies no longer. The Sovietsare engaged, and so are we, in a struggle for Germany and through Germany forthe control of Europe. Every Soviet move is calculated to that end. So it is thatour first task must be to consolidate the West.Germany6. The particular reason for this is Germany. Dr. Adenauer is a great manwhose courage and conviction has held Germany together through nearly threeyears of waiting since the Bonn Treaties were signed. But Dr. Adenauer is gettingold. He nearly broke down in the last debate in the Bundestag and the germans are becoming increasingly impatient. It is not that I fear that they want to pursuepolicies of collaboration with Russia, but that there will be increasing pressure for Germany to pursue an independent policy as being the method by which she47458
can best hope to gather increasing strength for herself and thus bring about the unity of Germany.7. Therefore the German Chancellor simply cannot afford to see anything in the nature of a weakening of allied policy towards Russia in these months unless he equally shows willing. In this respect the position is different from a year ago.At the time of the Berlin Conference we were able, not without some difficulty,to show close unity between the United States, France and ourselves. M. Bidault,whatever his other failings, was a loyal colleague who knew his mind on this issue and it was the same as ours. Mr. Molotov fortunately played his hand soclumsily that German opinion was almost universally united with us. This was our highest point in respect of the unity of the four Western Powers. Italy andBenelux also agreed that on Germany we had tried all we could at Berlin and thatthe Russians were to blame.8. I should be by no means confident of a similar outcome from an allied conference with Soviet Russia now. In my judgment, it would be only too easy for the Russians to make moves and simulate concessions which could throw theallies into confusion.United States9. In all this, Anglo-American unity remains as ever a decisive factor. ButAmerican opinion is weary of European quarrels and we can afford no furtherset-back such as we suffered when E.D.C. was thrown out.Italy and Benelux10. As against this, the position in Italy has improved though it is here thatthe Communist minority is largest. Italy has shown an encouraging stability inthe face of real difficulties and has a record in the last 2 or 3 years of much greaterconsistency in Government policy than has been shown by France. We shouldcontinue to do all we can to help and encourage the Italians. Benelux is loyal toits friendships and perhaps closer to this country than ever before. But it issymptomatic of the dislocation of events that Benelux is deeply distrustful of theFrench in general and M. Mendes-France in particular.11. From all this I conclude that until our agreements are safely ratified wemust show ourselves reserved in respect of future talks with Soviet Russia on anylevel.   Otherwise we may break a European union which is still fragile.Middle East12. I will not deal in this paper with Middle Eastern affairs, for though theproblems there are continuous they are not at present as immediately dangerousas those either in Europe or in the Far East, though they may become so.Far East13. The Geneva agreement, I believe, saved the French armies fromimminent and complete destruction and the white population from the peril ofmassacre. Moreover, having been relieved of part at least of her Indo-Chinaburden, France was the better able to make a contribution of some kind to our european front. But the outlook is dark. In Viet Nam the Communists havethe advantage of being able to wave the nationalist flag. The Americans havenever rightly understood how much this means. Ho Chi-minh is much more thana Communist leader. He is the nationalist leader and to bring in Diem, who isnot only a bigoted Catholic but is known to have American backing and set himup in Saigon where his authority hardly stretches beyond his own front door, is no answer to this kind of appeal.14. However, by the Geneva Agreements we did gain two years before theelections in Viet Nam and we must continue our efforts to find a national leaderin the South. Unfortunately we have not only to do this, but to find one who is acceptable to both the Americans and the French. So far no answer has beenfound, but it can be found and with a large Catholic influx from the North to swellthe Southern vote, the South might then be held.15. As my colleagues know, much of my effort at Geneva was concentrated on trying to save Laos and Cambodia.  Fortunately these two little countries are
still alive and Cambodia at least is not doing too badly. There the King is alsothe Nationalist leader. The French play very little part, or the Americans either,and so long at least as South Vietnam can be held, Cambodia should not give us serious concern. Should South Vietnam fall, the struggle would become intense,but not hopeless.16. In Laos the position is more difficult owing to Communist infiltrationin the north in mountainous territory and to the general lackadaisical attitude ofthe Laotians, who are, perhaps for that reason, the most attractive of the populations in that part of the world whom I have met.17. Sometimes it seems as though these States of Indo-China have learntnothing from the French, except their inexhaustible capacity for failing to forma Government. Laos was nearly six months without one after the geneva conference, but now a broad-based Administration is established and withunobtrusive foreign help should be able to hold its own.18. But the problem of these countries is not, I believe, likely to prove inthe main military. To meet this we should have our arrangements under theManila Treaty, although I do not anticipate anything like a Chinese militaryinvasion, or even a Vietminh military invasion, of these countries. The danger is the appeal of a victorious communism on the one side and the lack of a freenational patriotism that makes a stronger call on the other. This problem canbe of decisive importance for us; the defence of Malaya lies as much in meeting and repelling the Communist threat to Indo-China, Burma and Siam as it doesin any measures we can take in Malaya itself.19. We should certainly plan in association with the Americans and others to strengthen the military forces of these countries of South-East Asia. Butmilitary support, although essential, is not by itself enough. In addition, we must therefore do what we can to build up their security services and their economies.We should also exploit to the full whatever opportunities there may be forintelligent propaganda in order to convince the Asiatics themselves that their freelife is menaced by communism.  They are by no means persuaded of that yet.20. To sum up. The defence of our vital interests in Malaya must be conducted in the weak independent States on its borders. If these States are lost to communism, our position in Malaya will be threatened, with damaging consequences to our strategy and our balance of payments. Economic aid,reinforcement of local security services and propaganda will be our weapons.21. All this must cost money. I have often wearied my colleagues withappeals for more money to spend on propaganda and economic aid. I expect to have to return to the charge when I come back from South-East Asia. In the meanwhile, I would only emphasise once again that at the moment the conflictthere, especially in the out-posts of Indo-China, is for men&apos;s minds. I hope thatat our Bangkok Conference we shall be able to work out intelligent methods bywhich that battle can be won.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7th January, 1955.
