3,1 qTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted jor the Cabinet. February 1955SECRETC (55) 338th February, 1955CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Scheme to build a new Colonial Office opposite Westminster Abbey raisesthree separate issues:  (a) Is the proposed building suitable for the site?(b) If not, what use could be made of the site?(c) Where else could the Colonial Office go?Umutability of Proposed Building2. The site concerned was previously occupied by two buildings theWestminister Hospital and, behind it, the Stationery Office.3. The original plans for the new Colonial Office provided for a buildingwhich would cover virtually the whole of this combined area. These plans werewidely criticised on the grounds that the building would be too large in everyway. In particular, the Royal Fine Art Commission advised that the oldWestminister Hospital site should be left almost entirely vacant and that any new building should be confined to an area approximately the same as that formerlyoccupied by the old Stationery Office (shaded red on the attached plan).4. Thereafter, the plans were somewhat revised and the facade was takenback about 30 feet. Nevertheless, it would still jut out some 65 feet beyond the site of the old Stationery Office.5.^ However, the most objectionable feature of the proposed new building is its excessive height. It would be about half as high again as the roof of theMiddlesex Guildhall; and would thus entirely alter the skyline and generalappearance of the west side of Parliament Square.6. The fact is that the proportions of the proposed new building seem to havebeen determined more by the number of Colonial Office staff to be accommodatedthan by the size of the site and the character of its surroundings.What use should be made of the site?7. If, as I hope, it should be decided to drop the proposal to construct a newColonial Office opposite Westminster Abbey, the site might be used in one oftwo ways.8. A building of much reduced height could be constructed on the site ofthe old Stationery Office, leaving the site of the old Westminster Hospital open,and thus providing a wider prospect and more worthy approach to the westernentrance of the Abbey.9.  Alternatively, the whole of the combined site could be left open with aview to creating, eventually, a &quot; Greater Parliament Square,&quot; embracing the entirearea between Princes Street and the Houses of Parliament.47624Copy No:62
5 so   rConclusions15.  My conclusions can be summed up as follows:  (a) the proposed new building is too large and, above all, too high for the sie and will prejudice the appearance of the west side of Parliament Squareand the approach to the Abbey;(b) if the Colonial Office staff cannot manage with any less accommodation,their new offices should be located elsewhere;(c) two alternative uses for the Westminster site should be studied:  (i) to construct a lower building on part only of the site; or(ii) to leave the whole site open with a view to creating eventually a&quot; Greater Parliament Square &quot;;id) meanwhile, the palisade should be pulled down so that the potentialities ofthe site can be seen;(e) in view of possible future developments, there would be advantage inlocating the Colonial Office in a building large enough to accommodate the Commonwealth  Relations  Office  also  (e.g.,   Carlton  HouseTerrace).D. S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,7th February, 1954.10. Before a decision on this issue could be taken, sketches and outline plans of both these alternatives would have to be prepared.11. Since this question will inevitably take some time to settle, I am muchattracted by the Prime Minister^ proposal in C. (54) 393 that &quot; meanwhile thepalisade should be pulled down so that the public could see for the first time whatpossibilities the site presents.&quot;Where else could the Colonial Office go?12.  There remains the question of accommodating the Colonial Office.13. I like the suggestion, in paragraph 5 of the Minister of Works&apos; paper(C. (55) 2), that the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office should both be accommodated in the same block, possibly but not necessarily in CarltonHouse Terrace.14. In view of the increasing awkwardness of drawing the line between theCommonwealth and the Colonial Empire in its various stages of self-government,I think it more than likely that, before many years go by, we shall find it expedient to merge the two Departments into a single Commonwealth Office. If that viewshould prove correct, it would, of course, be a great convenience if the two departments were already housed in the same building.
