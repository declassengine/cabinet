I THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^LwM Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1955 WMM^L\\ SECRET                                                                               Copy No.^Lw || ^Lm^LwA  Wr^ 20th January, 1955 ^mwM^LM CABINETi THE PRINCE OF HANOVER&apos;S CLAIM TO BRITISH NATIONALITY ^LW^LW\ Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department^--\ and Minister for Welsh Affairs^-Wi       \&apos;!&apos;Wt Prime Minister has asked me to circulate a memorandum on this matter. ^-W\^-MM 2.  The Prince of Hanover is the great-great-grandson of the Duke of ^-W\^-Wl Cumberland, son of King George III, who became King of Hanover on the death ^-9m^-Wl of King William IV. The Prince would now be Duke of Cumberland but for the W-W^-WM fact that his paternal grandfather, the third Duke of Cumberland, was deprived of ^-9M^-WM his dukedom under the Titles Deprivation Act, 1917, on the ground that he had ^-9Madhered to the King&apos;s enemies during the First World War.  The Prince, whose ^LwMmaternal grandfather was the late German Kaiser Wilhelm II, is a German citizen WwM^mWA and is understood to have served in the German Forces during the Second World mWMI mm^-WA 3.  He claims British nationality by reason of his descent from Princess ^-Wt^-WA Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and by virtue of an Act passed in 1705 entitled &quot; An ^-9MAct for the Naturalization of the Most Excellent Princess Sophia Electress and ^LwM^-WA Dutchess Dowager of Hanover and the Issue of her Body.&quot; This Act provided^-WA that Princess Sophia was &quot; the issue of her body and all persons lineally descendingfrom her bOrn or hereafter to be born &quot; (except Roman Catholics) should be ^LwM^LwM I deemed to be natural born British subjects. The Act of 1705 was repealed by theWWW British Nationality Act, 1948, but the repeal did not affect the British nationality^LwM of any person who possessed it before the Act of 1948 took effect. WWM^LwM 4.  His claim depends on the proper interpretation of the Act of 1705. Prima^-WA facie his claim is a good one, the Act may be open to the interpretation that it is^LwM confined to persons who were born during the lifetime of Queen Anne.  Neither ^-9M^LwM I the Home Office nor the Foreign Office is aware of any other claim to BritishWWW nationality having been made under that Act, but it would appear that, if the^LwM Prince&apos;s claim is adjudged valid, the non-Roman Catholic members of most of the^LwM Royal or former Royal families of Europe are British subjects. m-W^Lm\ 5.  In 1952 the Prince of Hanover and his late father who died in 1953 applied WmW^LwM to my predecessor for certificates of British citizenship under section 25 of the mWM^LwM ? British Nationality Act, 1948.   That section empowers the Home Secretary to WmwMUMWA give a certificate establishing British citizenship in an individual case in which a ^-MM^LwM doubt exists. It has always been understood by the Home Office that the purpose^LwM of this power, which has been in the law for many years, is to enable the Secretary ^^fl^LwM of State, where the case for British nationality is clear on merits, to remove some W-W\^LwM specific difficulty, e.g., inability to prove strictly a relevant fact. Certificates under ^-WMWWW I this section are issued sparingly. W-W^LwM 6.  In the present case the claim depended upon the interpretation of an old ^-W\^LwM statute affecting the national status of large numbers of people and appeared for ^-9M^LwM that reason to be more suitable for resolution by the Courts than by administrativeaction. Furthermore, it could hardly be expected that the exercise of the Home M%WWWW Secretary&apos;s discretion in favour of the Prince of Hanover and his late father, whose ^-9M^fl 47514
interests and background were predominantly German, would have been well ^mwMreceived or understood by public opinion.  My predecessor accordingly decided ^Mmthat he would not be justified in issuing certificates of citizenship under section 25 ^mwMm^M             of the British Nationality Act, 1948. M^M7.  The Prince subsequently began proceedings in the Chancery Division of ^mwMthe High Court in which he claims a declaration that he is a British subject by ^mWA^mwM             virtue of the Act of 1705. The Attorney-General, who is the nominal defendant      fl ^Mmto the action, will bring to the notice of the Court all relevant considerations. ^MmThis seems to be the best way to get the question settled, which is primarily one ^mwMof Law. If I were to grant a certificate of doubt in this case, I think that it would ^Mmbe impossible not to grant as an act of executive authority a similar certificate ^Mmin any case where the applicant-regardless of his or her ties with this country ^mwMor of his or her record and associations-could prove lineal descent from the ^mwMElectress Sophia. mWM? ^flHome Office, S.W. 1,19th January, 1955.
