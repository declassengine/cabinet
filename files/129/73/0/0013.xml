IISSECRETCa(55) 1319th January, 1955CABINETBRITISH RAILWAYSM smorandum by the Minister of Transport andand Civil AviationA copy of the plan on the modernisation and re-equipment of british railways, which has been submitted to me by the British transport commission (B-T-C-) has been circulated with E.A. (55) 8, which itselfcontains an outline of the Commission^ proposals.2.        Some difficult questions arise on the handling of this subject,together with the related question of the recent railway wages settlement,and the Economic Policy Committee have given preliminary considerationboth to the question of tactics and to the substance of the British transport commission^ plan.3.        The main elements are:-(a) The Final Report of the Court of Inquiry into the recentwage dispute will not now be available until the beginningof next week.(b) The Chairman of the B.T.GC is pressing for early publica-tion of the modernisation plan.\(c)    The need for an enquiry into railway manpowerefficiency.4.        Under present Parliamentary arrangements the Second reading of the British Transport Commission (Borrowing Powers) Bill is down tobe taken as last Order on Tuesday, 25th January.    In addition, a numberof Parliamentary Questions are expected on both the recent railway wagessettlement and on the future position of British Railways as soon as parliament re-assembles.5,        Though I attached to E. A. (55) 8 the draft of a statement onmodernisation and other aspects of the railway problem, I have come tothe conclusion that it would be very difficult to deal adequately with the severy large subjects in a Parliamentary statement.6.       As the House is likely also to expect a pretty full statement onthe railway settlement and the Reports of the Court of Inquiry, which sarelikely to refer to the question of efficiency, it is for consideration whetherall these matters could not be more satisfactorily dealt with in thecourse of debate.    The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofLabour will circulate a memorandum on these matters to the Cabinetnext week as soon as he has had time to study the Final Report of theCourt of Inquiry.COPY NO.
I IS&quot;7.        If the Cabinet decide that this is the appropriate method ofdealing with these matters, there is the question of the timing of such a debate.    Both the Minister of Labour and I are likely to have to answer questions orally during the week in which Parliament re-assembles, andso far as I am concerned there may be difficulty in holding back fullanswers for more than a week.    Similarly, once the modernisation planhas been published there will be pressure for an indication of the Govern-menfs attitude towards it, and advantage may be lost by any considerable delay in giving such indication.8.        Under Section 4(2) of the Transport Act, 1947, it is not necessaryfor the Government to approve the detail of proposals of this sort, whichare the responsibility of the Commission.    If my colleagues agree Iwould suggest that all that it is necessary to do is to indicate the Govern-ment&apos;s view that the Commission in their plan are proposing to act on theright lines, and to add that on a number of questions the Government will seek further information from the Commission.    These include the long-term effects on manpower, the impact of the proposals on national fuel policy, and on the engineering industry, but it would be much better notto raise these questions in debate.9.        Tentatively, I put forward for consideration the following time-table: -(i)     Monday, 24th January, publication of British transport commission^ modernisation and re-equipmant plan,(ii)    Answers to Parliamentary Questions on resumption ofParliament to the effect that full statements will bemade in an early debate.(iii)   Postponement of British Transport Commission(Borrowing Powers) Bill.\^iv)   Early debate either late in the first week or early in thefollowing week if it should be possible for the Leader ofthe House and Chief &quot;Whip to make the necessary re-arrangement of business.10.      The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour has seenthis paper and agrees with the action proposed.J.A.B. -C,Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, WYl,18th January, 1955,
