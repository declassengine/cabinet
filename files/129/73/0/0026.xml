oSECRETCa(55) 26 COPY NO.29th January, 1955CABINETPPvOSPECTS FOR THE OVERSEAS TRADE OF THEUNITED kingdom memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeSince the recession of 1952 our export trade has shown a welcome increase in both value and volume to record levels in 1954.In value it has risen from  2,584 millions in 1952 to  2,673 millions in1954;  in volume the index numbers (1950 - 100) have risen as follows:-1952 - 95;  1953 - 98; 1954 - 103.    But, although the volume of our exports in 1954 was 5 per cent higher than in 1953, during the course of1954 it scarcely increased at all.2.        Of our total exports of  2,673 millions in 1954, approximately 1,317 millions (about half the total) went to Commonwealth countries, 828 millions to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(OJS.E.C.) countries,  228 millions to the United States and other dollar countries, excluding Canada, and  300 millions to the rest of the world.3.        This improvement in our trade has been assisted by the policieswe have been following, internally by restraining inflationary pressures andand simultaneously removing restrictions on and promoting businessfreedom and industrial investment, and externally by working for lowerbarriers to trade and payments through the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and the OqEJE.C., by making sterling more easilytransferable and more widely acceptable, and so forth.     In 1954 wehave also been helped a great deal by the easing of import restrictions in Australia and New Zealand.    And because Commonwealth and Europeantrade is so large a part of the whole, all this has contributed powerfullyto the improvement in world trade which has taken place despite theAmerican recession.4.        At the same time our overseas expenditure is rising faster than our overseas earnings.    In the second half of 1954 total imports were 59 millions higher than in the second half of 1953 and total exports were  2 millions lower.    Detailed figures of the balance of payments for the second half of 1954 are not yet available; but it is fairly clearthat the payments position of the United Kingdom (and of the sterling area as a whole) also deteriorated substantially during the half year.Tentative forecasts for 1955 suggest a further widening of the gap between the rate of increase in earnings and in expenditure overseas.This is substantially due to rising imports of both food and raw materials in the United Kingdom.5.        The economy is now fully stretched and there are no significantadditional supplies of labour to call upon as a basis for increasing our production and, with itj our exports.    &quot;We must rely on increasing
productivity.    Competition from Germany and Japan is intense and mustbe expected to continue.    And, in the offing, there is the growing tendency for some countries to remove their discrimination in our favour againstthe dollar.    On the other hand, the economic prospects in the UnitedStates are favourable and, if they continue to improve in the way theyhave been doing recently, the effects on our exports should be good, bothdirectly and indirectly through increased prosperity of other countries,particularly the Commonwealth primary producing countries.    Balancingthese factors one against the other, we expect the volume of our exports in 1955 to increase, albeit at a somewhat lesser rate than for the year1953/54, by perhaps about 3 per cent.    It is not possible to see clearlyfurther forward than this but, in the absence of a major setback in world economic conditions and a worsening of our competitive power, something like the same rate of increase might continue.6.        We should all like to see our performance bettered, but this levelof exports, and certainly any improvement on it* depends on a number of factors, some within our power to influence, others outside it.    Firstamong these is the maintenance of an internal economy, vigorous and expanding, but free from inflationary influences which would drawresources from exports to the home market and increase our costsrelative to those of our competitors.    Second, and in part related to thefirst, is an improvement in our competitive power arising from increasing productivity and efficiency.    Industry is well alive to this need, and in particular industrial investment is now showing a welcomeincrease.    Third, is the holding back of protectionist and restrictionistpressures both within this country and in the world at large.    Ourproportion of world trade has been keeping fairly steady though recentlyit has fallen off slightly.    Our interest lies in encouraging the highest possible volume of world trade out of which we hope to retain at leastour usual proportion.    Here, two current problems of particular importance are the extent to v/hich American protection for agriculturewill encourage protectionism elsewhere and how far Japanls admission to the GeA0T.T. may force countries to raise tariffs (necessarily on anon-discriminatory basis) in order to protect themselves against japanese competition.&apos;&apos;V . . -7.        We have been well served so far by the policies we have beenpursuing of maintaining a high level of world trade and increasing our competitive power, by sound anti-inflationary policies and by improvedtechnical efficiency.    We can take heart from the fact that the UnitedStates Government have successfully halted and reversed the recentrecession there.    We must recognise the importance in the long term ofUnited States economic policies, and particularly trade policies on whichCongress has again been asked by the President to take action on theRandall Report.    The level of international demand is high and lookslikely to remain so as far as can be seen.8.        It will be important to maintain an economic climate here thatwill ensure that we keep and increase our share of world trade.    Thisis especially necessary because of the current tendency for the rate ofimports to increase faster than the rate of exports.P.T..Board of Trade, S.W.I. Stih January, 1955.
