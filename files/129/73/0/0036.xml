Primed for tlie Cabinet.   February 1955SECRETC. (55) 369th February, 1955CABINETANTARCTICA(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is becoming clear that the action so far planned on the basis of the cabinet decision of last July (C.C. (54) 56th Conclusions, Minute 4) will be insufficient to maintain our position in the Antarctic against foreign encroachment. 1 must therefore ask my colleagues to consider this question again.    - &apos; -background. In C. (54) 261 the Secretary of State for the Colonies and 1 recommendedthat, since the effective maintenance of our title to the whole United Kingdomsector would require a disproportionate scale of effort and expenditure, we shouldhenceforth concentrate on making our title secure in selected areas which had some particular value. To this end we proposed an increase of activity in our sectorcombined with steps to strengthen our legal title by taking the dispute with theArgentine and Chilean Governments to the International Court of Justice, unless they agreed to arbitration.   The Cabinet approved these proposals in principle.3. We still await a final reply from the Argentine and Chilean governments to our offer of arbitration, but it is very doubtful whether either will accept itand we expect to proceed with our application to the International Court of Justicethis month. This will be a useful exercise, but is unlikely to deter the intruders,unless accompanied by convincing evidence that we intend To consolidate our.position in the field.4. The decision to increase United Kingdom activities has led to the following action:  1(i) tenders have been invited for a new supply ship to be ready in October1956. The Chancellor of the &apos; Exchequer has agreed the : necessarycapital provision of about  450,000. (The John tBiscoe will !be withdrawn when the new ship goes into service); &apos;(ii) a support ship has been hired for the current season and it is hoped topurchase this or a similar ship at about  100,000;(iii) the support ship is now on its way to Antarctica to establish the two-&quot;further  bases  recommended  at  Anvers  Island   (copper  depositsinvestigation) and Marguerite Bay; -, . .      ;.,(iv) Her &apos;Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to make ;a contribution of 100,000 to The (British&apos;. trans-Polar journey planned for next, season.no provision&apos;has yet been madcfor increasing the. range or mobility of the very limited naval force which supports the Falkland Islands Dependencies: we.haveno icebreakers and no aircraft in the Antarctic; and the frigate which we keepthere during the open season can only operate safely on the fringes of.our sector,since she is not adapted for Antarctic ice conditions. Nor are funds available&apos;for large-scale survey work.47636 1$Copy No.78
Foreign Penetration5. Meanwhile the Argentines are forging ahead. This season ihcy have acquired an icebreaker and have increased their aircraft in the Antarctic from to 13, including 3 helicopters. Last month they established yet anotherpermanent base in our sector beyond our present reach (at the foot of the WeddellSea within 800 miles of the South Pole); and they have already occupied at least6 more huts in the northern part of our sector. They are well equipped for survey and exploration work, and it is clear.that they intend increasingly to strike out from their bases into the unexplored land mass. The Chileans are also becoming more active, and the United States are now planning to go into the Antarctic ona large scale. -6. Unless our own effort is substantially increased, we cannot hope tomaintain our position in the Antarctic even to the limited extent envisaged by theCabinet last July.Proposed Counter-measures7. We must face the fact thai, unless we adopt a more virile policy in the antarctic, we shall inexorably be edged out of our sector by Argentines, Chileansand even Americans. To have any chance of maintaining our position there, two things seem to me necessary. First, we should devote resources to the moresystematic exploration and survey of our sector, so as to find out quickly whatis most wortli keeping, assuming thai we cannot afford to regain and hold the wholeof it. Second, we should ensure that we have sufficient force available in the antarctic to support these activities. We also need machinery to promote andco-ordinate the necessary action under the direction of the Cabinet.Naval Support8. It would be disproportionately expensive to maintain a force strong enough to evict the Argentines from all their bases and keep them out. But we ought to be in a position to send an armed party to any inhabited part of our sectorwithout undue risk, so as to show the. Hag at British bases or take forcible actionagainst intruders when Her majesty&apos;s Government consider this desirable in anyparticular case. We could not get a warship to every inhabited part of our sectoreven if existing ships were strengthened against ice. Nevertheless, as an interim measure, the presence of a strengthened frigate would make naval operations onthe present scale in the area less hazardous and would increase our freedom ofaction. To maintain one frigate in the Antarctic during the southern summerwould, I understand, cost up to  200,000. The necessary modifications would haveto. be carried out at the expense of other Dockyard work.:9.&apos;&apos; No existing naval vessel is of suitable construction for operations in ice.Even a strengthened&apos;frigate, while it would increase the support at present given,cannot be regarded as adequate mainly because of its thin skin, hull form andshallow draught. If we are to be able to penetrate to any inhabited part of oursector, an icebreaker would be required. This ship could either be civilian manned(with obvious limitations on its powers of intervention against armed force) or,if she is to be an armed vessel, specially built and maimed by the Royal Navy.This would be an additional capital commitment for the Admiralty of up to  2millions; and the man-power for her would have to be found at the expense ofsome existing commitment.   An icebreaker can be designed to carry a helicopter.Future Activities10. The activities so far put in hand will be valuable, but they will not sufficeof themselves to achieve our end. We shall need to undertake further explorationand continue the build up of bases. It is also important to discover more aboutthe mineral and other potentialities of our sector, so as to know where it will be most profitable to concentrate our effort. The proposal in C (54) 261 for a civilianair survey to be accompanied by a ground survey of selected areas was made withthis purpose in mind. A decision on this is urgent if a start is to be made next season..11. Hitherto we have tended to judge these various proposals each on its own merits, and funds have had to be sought separately for each new commitment. 1suggest that it would be more satisfactory to draw up a detailed and comprehensive plan of Antarctic activity during, say, the next five years and to fix the limit for
Foreign Office, S.W.1.9th February, 1955.47636expenditure over this period. The plan (and the limit) would have to includeadditional naval support, extension of the work of the Falkland IslandsDependencies Survey and whatever further activities are judged most effective for achieving the systematic exploration and survey of the sector.Machinery12. If the foregoing is approved, I consider that there would be advantage in establishing a Committee of Ministers and entrusting them with the preparation and supervision of the five-year plan. The Treasury, the Foreign Office, theLord Presidents Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Colonial Office,the Admiralty, and the Air Ministry would need to be represented on theCommittee.Action tliis Season13. The effect of the new programme would not begin to be felt before next season. During the remaining weeks of the current season I think that wc shouldbe well advised to avoid using force against the Argentines or Chileans unless theycommit some provocative act. Apart from the risk of retaliation against Britishbases out of our frigate&apos;s reach, it might prejudice our application to theInternational Court of Justice if we were to resort to force immediately before making it and we cannot do so while the application is before the Court.Recommendations14.   I invite my colleagues to agree to the following:  (i) We should extend and intensify our exploration and survey of the UnitedKingdom sector with the object of both strengthening our title by a showof increased activity and ascertaining the area in which it will be mostprofitable to concentrate our future effort.(ii) We should build up our naval strength in the Antarctic to the extent necessary to support these activities.(iii) Approval in principle should be given to the preparation of a five-year plan to cover (i) and (ii) above and to the acceptance of a limit for expenditure under the plan.(iv) An Antarctic Committee should be established to prepare the details ofthe plan, with estimates of expenditure, and make initial recommenda-tions to the Cabinet within one month. Its terms of reference shouldbe agreed between the Ministers concerned.A. E.
