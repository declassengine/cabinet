SECRETDEFENCE EXPENDITURE BY CIVIL DEPARTMENTS IN 1955-56Report by the Home Defence CommitteeIn their report to the Cabinet (C. (54) 250) the Defence Policy Committee gave an outline in Annex II of the changes in civil defence policy which would flow fromthe general revision of defence policy which they were recommending and indicated that it should be possible to reduce defence expenditure by civil Departments in1955-56 from the  46-7 millions in the forecast estimates to roughly  31 millions(excluding stockpiling and Post Office expenditure, which is financed by loan).This would have compared with the likely out-turn for the current year of about 33 millions.2. The Treasury have now been able to make a closer study of the financial implications of the new defence policy adopted by the Cabinet and the Chancellorof the Exchequer has indicated that not more than some  25 millions is likely tobe available. Agreement has been reached that this sum should be divided between departments as follows:    MillionsHome Departments       ...      .........      12-12Civil defence expenditure by other Departments       5-31-      17-43Storage and Accommodation    ......... 0-30Port Emergency Schemes        ......... 1-49Emergency Oil Scheme............ 6-025-223. We should make clear that a rate of expenditure of this order will not besufficient to enable us in the course of the next few years to take adequate measuresto protect the civil population against the threat of thermo-nuclear attack as from,say, 1960, even if it were possible to say at this stage what those measures oughtto be. It may well be that an unfavourable comparison will be drawn betweenthe  25 millions for defence expenditure by civil Departments and the totalexpenditure on the Armed Forces and the defence element of the Ministry ofSupply. The Government may be asked why, although the menace of the hydrogenbomb is immeasurably greater than any threat previously envisaged, they havenevertheless reduced expenditure on protective measures. This type of criticismcan only be met by considering expenditure on civil defence in the context of our defence policy as a whole, which is being presented in the Statement on Defence,1955.4. The central theme of our present defence policy is that resources shouldbe devoted primarily to the provision of an adequate deterrent consisting mainly in the possession of up-to-date thermo-nuclear weapons and the means of deliver-ing them. Money devoted to this end should be presented therefore as the most effective form which defence of the civil population can now take. In addition,it is reasonable to make, as a minimum insurance against the risk that the deterrentmay fail, some limited provision for protective measures of the kind normallyregarded as civil defence preparations. But until we are in a position fully to assess the effects of thermo-nuclear attack, particularly in the sphere of radio-activity, it seems prudent to restrict expenditure in the coming year to thosethings which we can be fairly certain will be of value, e.g., radiac instruments and the training of the Civil Defence Corps, and to items on which expenditure hasalready been committed. Considerable sums have already been spent. on civil defence precautions which the hydrogen bomb has rendered of doubtful value and the Government will naturally be concerned to avoid further unproductivespending. We give in the Annex an outline of the form which the expenditureof  25 millions will take.5.   The  25 millions for defence expenditure by civil Departments shouldalso be considered in relation to the sum of about  27 millions which Departments47595
73^propose to spend in 1955-56 on the stockpiling of food and oil and on which aseparate report is being submitted to Ministers.6. Account should also be taken of the value to civil defence of the mobilecolumns to be manned by the Army and Royal Air Force, on which a separate report has already been put before Ministers. The financing of these mobilecolumns will be handled outside the civil defence budget, though there may be some offset through a reduction in Home Office expenditure on the training ofH. reservists. Their provision is, however, ah important element in the plans for the protection and succour of the civil population.7. Post Office expenditure, though financed by loan, must also be considered as part of the outlay oh home defence preparations; about  13 millions areearmarked for next year.8. It will be necessary to give Parliament a more authoritative statementof the Government^ civil defence policy as soon as the effects of &quot; fall-out&quot;have been evaluated and account taken of them in reshaping policy. We hope to be in a position to make comprehensive recommendations to Ministers onevacuation and shelter policy and on civil defence planning as a whole in thecourse of the next few months.
ANALYSIS OF DEFENCE EXPENDITURE BY CIVIL departments in 1955-56I. Home Departments      ...............This expenditure covers the home civil defence services(e.g., grants to local authorities, production of equipment and materials, training, &amp;c.).About  3-5 million will be spent on the administration andtraining of the Civil Defence Corps. The production programme will account for  7 - 4 million, the main items being:  (a) Respirators (production being limited to four million in1955-56 pending a review by Ministers)(b) Radiac instruments   ...      .........      ......(c) Fire-fighting equipment      ...............Some  1-1 million, representing the administrative costs ofthe Women&apos;s Voluntary Services and the Home Office stores and regional organisation, is being included in the civil defence budget for the first time. 12-12 million 2-8 million 1-3 million 2-7 millionII. Civil Defence Expenditure by other DepartmentsThis expenditure covers grants to local authorities, productionof equipment and materials, due functioning of public utilities, and includes (a) Grants to local authorities by the Ministries of Housing,Health and Food............      ......(b) Production expenditure (mainly on completion of out-standing stockpiling orders and excluding all but a token  0-1 million on the making up of tents for emergency hospital service)      ......      ......(c) Completion of certain measures connected with the duefunctioning of water and sewerage, railways, electricity(allowing in the case of electricity for a beginning ona proposed seven-year programme for the acquisitionof stocks of transformers and switch gear)    ...... 5-31 million 0-5 million 1-05 million 2-2 millionIII. Storage and Accommodation        ............ 0-30 millionIV. Port Emergency Schemes    ............      ...    1-49 million this sum permits a recently approved port emergency plan togo ahead. The main aim of this plan is the provision of anchoragesassociated with a number of minor ports for the discharge ofimports. Some adjustment of the plan may be necessary to providefor outward movement (e.g., for the supply of our forces overseas)but no expenditure during 1955-56 is involved on this account.V. Emergency Oil Scheme..................        6 million this sum is based on the assumption that the present authorised programme would be completed in 1957. that programme however, which would now provide barely sufficientoil to last three weeks, is totally inadequate and approval has beengiven for the planning of an enlarged programme in the light of!the latest strategic appreciation. This would aim at providing an oil stockpile of 5-1- million tons (including lubricants) with theobject of ensuring adequate oil supplies for survival in a major war starting not before 1960.Total Expenditure for Items I-V............... 25-22 million
