JAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADENote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith a record of a conversation withMr. Godfrey Nicholson, M.P., and Mr. John Edwards, M.P., in which they gaveLord Reading an account of their impressions of Japan. They were the leadersof the Parliamentary delegation which visited Japan recently.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th January, 1955.Record by Mr. W. D. Allen, Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, of a conversation between Lord Reading, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,and Mr. Godfrey Nicholson, M.P., and Mr. John Edwards, M.P.JAPAN AND THE G.A.T.T.Mr. Godfrey Nicholson, M.P., and Mr. John Edwards, M.P., came to seeLord Reading this afternoon in order to give him an account of the impressionsthey gained in Japan with the Parliamentary Delegation. Both of them had comeback impressed with the need for the United Kingdom to find some means of expressing in a striking way her desire for friendship and co-operation with Japan.They felt that the Japanese were eagerly hoping for some such sign, and that if itcould be given, great attention would be paid to it and it might have a decisiveeffect in helping to keep Japan firmly aligned with the West.In particular, they both considered that the one gesture by this country whichwould help more than anything else would be an early decision on our part to admit Japan to the G.A.T.T. The value of this gesture would be considerablydiminished if it were tied up too closely with conditions which might be regarded by the Japanese as making her in effect only a second-class member. Its value would be enhanced if it could be combined in some way with an offer to conclude a general Commercial Treaty with Japan, to which the Japanese attached importance for its symbolic as well as its practical importance.Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Edwards did not deny that certain elements of unfaircommercial competition existed in Japan and were to a large extent inherent inthe whole structure of Japanese trade and industry. But they thought that theseelements were likely to become more rather than less pronounced with the passageof time and that therefore it might be less difficult politically for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take the necessary decision now than to postpone it for a year or two.January 19, 1955.47525_Printed for the Cabinet.
