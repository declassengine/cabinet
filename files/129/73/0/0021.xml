tegSECRETC.(55) 2122nd January, 1955CABINETCLEAN AIR FOLICYMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand the Minister of Fuel and power in July, 1953, the Government appointed a Committee under theChairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver to examine the causes and effects of airpollution and to recommend methods of preventing it.2. In their Final Report which they submitted some 2f months ago8the Committee estimates that the smoke, grit, dust and noxious gasesemitted into the air from domestic dwellings and industrial plants causedamage to property and other harmful effects to the tune of about 250 millions a year.    This figure does not include the waste of heatvalue which results from allowing excessive smoke and which is put by theCommittee at between  25 millions and  50 millions a year.    Nor does ittake into account injury to health (e.g. 4,000 deaths caused by &quot;smog&quot; inLondon during December, 1952).3. The Committee make a number of important recommendations,the adoption of which would, in their opinion, reduce the density of smokein the atmosphere over the next 10 or 15 years to an extent amountingperhaps to as much as 80 per cent.    Their main proposals are asfollows :-(a) Subject to certain exceptions, the emission of dark smokeshould be prohibited by law.(b) Industries which instal new plant, burning pulverised fuelor large quantities of solid fuel, should take all practicable steps to prevent the emission of grit anddust.(c) Local Authorities should be given general powers to designate &quot;smokeless zones&quot; and &quot;smoke control areas&quot;(subject to confirmation by the Government).(d) The duty of inspection and enforcement should be placed upon Local Authorities (except in the case of certainindustrial processes which should be supervised bythe Governments Alkali Inspectors).(e) Householders in designated districts should have an obligation to convert domestic grates and otherappliances so as to burn smokeless fuel.    A largeproportion of the cost of converting these grates and appliances should be borne by the Exchequer and theLocal Authorities.
no(f)       The Government Loan Scheme for approved fuel-savingequipment in industry should be extended to includeequipment installed for the purpose of reducing airpollution.4, The Committee also make a number of other recommendations oflesser importance.    These include two proposals for tax remissions whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer is unwilling to accept (C, (55) 20).    we agree with him that the acceptance of these two proposals is not by any means essential to the success of the scheme.5. If smoke from domestic fires, which is one of the worst sources of air pollution, is co be eliminated, the quantities of smokeless fuelsavailable to householders will have to be progressively increased.    TheMinister of Fuel and Power is satisfied that this is feasible and he iscirculating a separate note on this point (C. (55) 22).6, Having examined this and other implications of the scheme, weare satisfied that, from every standpoint, it is right and practicable toadopt the essential elements of the proposed &quot;Clean Air Policy81.7. Preliminary consultations have been held with the Federationof British Industries and the Local Authorities^    Industry appears willingto bear its share of the burden.    The Local Authorities are also quite prepared to accept the additional responsibilities involved.8. The reactions of the Press to the Beaver Report have beenuniversally favourable and there is no doubt that the public expects theGovernment to take action on the lines recommended.9o As soon as Parliament meets we shall be pressed to annouce our intentions.    There are questions on the Order Paper on this subject for answer on Tuesday, 25th January.10. In addition we shall have to decide our attitude towardsMr. Nabarro&apos;s Bill which comes up for Second Reading on 4th February,There is no doubt that he has strong support on both sides of the House.As evidence of this the Bill is sponsored by Mr, Noel^Baker and Mr. R.obens(both of them Ministers of Fuel and Power in the Labour Government) andon the Government side by Colonel Lancaster (Chairman of theConservative Fuel and Power Committee) and Mr, Enoch Powell (Chairmanof the Conservative Housing and Local Government Committee).    It istherefore virtually certain that the Bill will meet with little or no opposition.11. If our colleagues approve the general policy the best coursewotild be to find the small amount of Parliamentary time necessary for aGovernment Bill, which would no doubt be an agreed measure.    However,if this is not possible, we feel that we ought to co-operate withMr. Nabarro in making his Bill effective (including the introduction of thenecessary financial provisions at the appropriate stage).12. We accordingly invite our colleages:-(i)       to approve the principle of a &quot;Clean Air Policy&quot; (includ&quot;ing the proposals summarised in paragraphs 3 and above, but excluding the recommendations for taxremission which are not acceptable to the Chancellorof the Exchequer);
(ii)       to agree to the introduction  of a Government Bill togive effect to this policy (on the assumption that it willbe an agreed measure);  or, alternatively, (if thenecessary Parliamentary time cannot be made available)to agree that the Government should do what they canto improve Ml. Nabarrc&apos;s Bill as far as possible j(iii)       to authorise the minister of Housing and Local Govern&quot;ment to announce the Governments decision in very general terms on Tuesday, 25th January,D.S.G.L.22nd January, 1955
