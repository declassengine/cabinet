(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)secret(55) 12 COPY NO.  ^19th January, 1955CABLNETTHE FINANCES OF THE RAILWAY MODERNISATION PLANMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to some of thefinancial implications of the plan.Subject to paragraph 6 below, I reserve my opinion on the merits of the plan.2.        The amount of new money called for by the plan is  800 millions.The larger figure of  1,200 millions, which catches the eye,, includes inaddition the sum. of  400 millions which will be found by the railwaysthemselves out of their current receipts from amounts set aside in thenormal way for replacements, depreciation and so forth.    The actualamount needed from outside the undertakings is the lower figure of 800 millions.3. This  800 millions is not money from the Exchequer, and it willnot have to be found all at once.    This money will be raised on government guarantee from the Market, in instalments as needed, over a period of10-15 years.    It will be raised in much the same way as money for gas,electricity, etc.^4.        What we are therefore faced with is demands on the capitalmarket for something between  55 millions and  80 millions a year overa period of time.    This is, of course, a substantial amount but it is notoverwhelming.    Even in the next year or two, the British transport commission (B,T0C0) may have to find something of the order of 50 millions a year on its current requirements.    To get things intoscale, I would recall that, in terms of resources, total investment in1954/55 in Great Britain is expected to come to about  2,400 millions.5.        So it will be seen that money for the railways does not come fromthe Budget.    Nevertheless, for two reasons, the taxpayer is interested.In the first place, although the B0T0C. gets its money by the sale ofTransport Stock through the normal machinery of the City, these borrow-ings are under Government guarantee.    Second, a continuing deficit onthe railways, if it goes on long enough, is likely at some stage to involvethe taxpayer more directly than at present,,    We must address ourselves to the question of whether the plan will make the railways solvent.6.        The proposals put forward in the plan do look forward to a situation in which the railways expect to be able to make ends meetoThere is a net annual improvement in the position of the railways at the
litend of 15 years to the tune of  30 millions,,    It is against this that wemust balance the present running annual deficiency.    The figure assumedfor this in the report is  25 millions, so on that we have  5 millions inhand.    Of course, this assumes that the figures are conservatively-calculated and that the running annual deficit before the plan begins to operate con be kept within a limit of some  25 millions a year.70        Thus, while on the figures it is possible to take a sanguine and constructive view, it is clear that we must be sure that the plan doesreally result in greater operating efficiency and more economical useof labour0    It is on these aspects that I shall have something to say.Treasury Chambers, S, W, Is19th January, 1955Q
