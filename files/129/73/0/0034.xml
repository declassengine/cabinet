Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1955SECPvETC. (55) 3414th February, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Secretary of State for the colonies as requested by the Cabinet on 13th January, 1955 (C.C. (55) 3rd Conclusions,Minute 6), we circulate a draft White Paper showing the legislation and regulationsaffecting the entry of British subjects into the self-governing commonwealth countries and Colonies.2. The corpus of statutory provisions in the case of most self-governingcountries is complicated and confused, and it would certainly be necessary to securethe concurrence of all the Governments concerned in the summaries relatingto their countries before publication. Moreover, the bare summaries ofthe statutory requirements in some cases give a somewhat misleadingpicture, since a good deal depends on the administrative interpretation of thestatutory requirements. The Governments may take exception even to such limitedinterpretive matter as has been included in the draft.3. Although Colonial Governments have not the same independent status,some of them (Malta and the Gold Coast, for example) are constitutionally far advanced, and in all the colonial territories the Secretary of State rarely intervenesin the administration of the local immigration laws and regulations. The colonialsection of the draft White Paper has been prepared from information available inthe Colonial Office. With the number of territories involved, each with its ownimmigration problems, laws and methods of administrative interpretation, this draft must be regarded as provisional; and before publication (if that were decided on) it would be desirable to refer most of the text to the Colonial Governmentsconcerned, in the interests of accuracy.SWINTON.A.

Summary of Restrictions on the entry ofBritish Subjects into British Territoriesoverseas and the Irish Republic4762?b
PART IRESTRICTIONS ON THE ENTRY OF BRITISH SUBJECTS INTOSELF-GOVERNING COMMONWEALTH countries the following is a summary of the principal relevant regulations in each country at the present time:  Canada1. The Immigration Act, 1952, empowers the Government of Canada toregulate the admission into that country of all persons other than Canadiancitizens and persons who have had a place of domicile in Canada for five years.2. The following classes of persons are (among others) deemed to be prohibited, and persons found to be in those classes may not enter Canada:  Mentally defective and diseased persons and physically defectivepersons who are likely to become a public, charge; criminals, prostitutes,homosexuals and procurers; professional beggars or vagrants; chronicalcoholics, drug addicts or traffickers; persons, who are members of, or are suspected of being members of, subversive organisations; and thedependents of persons in these classes.3. Certain classes of persons are allowed to enter and remain in Canadaas non-immigrants.  These include:1 Tourists, visitors, clergymen or priests, students, dramatic, artistic andathletic groups, and persons wishing to enter Canada for the temporaryexercise of their trade or calling.4. (Persons who enter Canada as non-immigrants and who subsequentlydo not wish to belong to that class, are bound under Statute to report thefact to the nearest Immigration Officer and present themselves for examinationas may be directed and such persons are treated as persons seeking admission to Canada as immigrants.)5- The Governor-General-in-Council is empowered to make such regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act, includingthe prohibition or limitation of admission of any persons by reason of nationality, citizenship, ethnic group, occupation, class or geographical areaof origin, and the criteria contained in sub-paragraph (d) (iv) of paragraph below.6. The Immigration Regulations, .1954, provide, inter alia, the following&quot; norms of admissibility &quot;:  (a) British subjects by birth, or naturalisation, in the United Kingdom,Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, and citizens of the irish republic, may be admitted if they have sufficient means to maintain&apos;   :    themselves until they have secured employment.(b) The admission of any Asian is limited to the wife, husband, orunmarried children, under 21 years of age, of any Canadian citizenresident in Canada who is in a position to receive and care forthem as dependents.(c) The landing in Canada of any immigrant is limited to the nationals of a country with which the Canadian Government has entered into
an agreement or convention respecting immigration or in regard towhich there is in operation an agreement or convention.id) The admission into Canada of any person is prohibited when, in theopinion  of a Special Inquiry Officer, that person should not beadmitted by reason of:  (i) the peculiar customs, habits, modes of life or methods of holdingproperty in his country of birth, citizenship or prior residence;(ii) his unsuitability, having regard to the economic, social, industrial,educational, labour, health, or other conditions or requirementsexisting temporarily or otherwise in Canada, or the area or country from or through which he comes;l(iii) his probable inability to become readily assimilated to or assume the duties and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship within areasonable time.7. No person is to be admitted to Canada without a medical certificateshowing that he has undergone medical examination sufficient to establishthat he does not fall within the relevant clauses of persons prohibited by the immigration Act. This provision does not, however, apply in the case ofpersons who are British subjects by birth, or by naturalisation, in theUnited Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, or the Union of South Africa, orcitizens of Ireland, though such persons may, as a measure of facilitation,equip themselves with a medical certificate. It also does not apply to persons coming directly from the United States of America or Alaska.Australia1. The entry of all persons into Australia is controlled by the provisionsof the Immigration Acts, 1901-1949. The following classes of persons aredeemed to be prohibited immigrants, who, generally speaking, may not enterAustralia but who may, in special cases, be admitted on Certificates of exemption:  Persons unable to pass a dictation test in any prescribed Europeanlanguage; persons not in possession of a Health Certificate; persons suffering from mental or physical disease; prostitutes or procurers; personsphysically defective to the extent that they are likely to become a publiccharge; subversives or revolutionaries; any person convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a year or more; or any person declared by theauthorities to be undesirable as the result of information received from another Government.2.   In practice, British subjects of European race not falling within theabove categories do not require any special authorisation to enter Australia..They are, however, required to hold valid passports.3. Non-European British subjects are not generally permitted to take uppermanent residence in Australia, though there is no statutory authority fortheir exclusion. Their entry is controlled by administrative use of the dictationand medical tests, though they may be permitted to enter temporarily.Certain categories of these persons can apply for visas or letters of authoritybefore starting their journey. (Holders of United Kingdom passports aregiven letters of authority; holders of other Commonwealth passportsneed visas.)&apos;      - \&apos;       &apos; .&apos;&apos; &apos;-;&apos;&apos;&apos;,&apos;&apos;:&apos;,&apos;:&apos;v&apos;&apos;A;tt&apos;.,U&apos;&apos;&quot;.      &apos;New Zealand1.

Any British subject arriving,withbut a permit but proving that he desires to enter New Zealand as avisitor for not more than six months for business, pleasure or health, may begranted a temporary permit.5. Statutory authority exists for the imposition of quotas, but these powers have not as yet been used.Union of South africa. The entry of all persons other than South African citizens is controlled by the Immigrants Regulations Act, 1913-1954, which specifies certain classesof prohibited immigrants, viz.:  &quot;t]&quot;: Persons who on economic grounds or on account of standards orhabits of life, are deemed unsuited to the requirements of the Union or it any particular provision thereof; persons unable by reason of deficienteducation to read or write any European language; persons likely tobecome a public charge by reason of infirmity or lack of means; personswho from information received from any Government are deemed to be undesirable inhabitants of or visitors to the Union; criminals, idiots,seriously diseased persons, prostitutes, procurers and persons convicted of serious crimes.&apos;r &apos; 2.; The first of the above grounds is used to exclude most persons not regarded as of European race.3. British subjects who fall within the Aliens Act, 1937, i.e., those whoare not natural-born British subjects, citizens of South Africa, or lawfullydomiciled-in the Union,, are required to obtain permits to enter the Union-whether for the purpose of permanent residence or temporary sojourn. ;&apos;4;!

These provisions remain in force in respect of entry into arid&apos;residencein Pakistan.Ceylon &amp; i --1.

A temporary permit may be issued to any immigrant prohibited otherthan on the grounds specified in (a) and (g) in paragraph 2 above.PART-IIRESTRICTIONS ON THE ENTRY OF BRITISH SUBJECTS INTOTHE DEPENDENT OVERSEAS TERRITORIESGeneralEvery oversea territory has its own immigration legislation to govern the entry of persons other than those defined in the law as &quot; natives of &quot; or&quot; belonging to &quot; the territory. Few territories have separate legislation forBritish subjects and the conditions governing entry are, as a rule, applicablefor both British subjects and aliens.The legislation varies from territory to territory, but it generally definesthose who are exempted from its operation and those whose entry is prohibited. The particular categories of exempted and prohibited immigrantsagain vary from territory to territory, but they usually include some or all ofthe following categories.Prohibited classes:  (a) any person who is unable to show that he has the means of supportinghimself \and his dependants, or that he has definite employmentawaiting him, or he is likely to become a pauper, or a charge on public funds;Xb) anyone who is suffering from mental disorder or is a mental defective;(c) any person suffering from an infectious, contagious or communicabledisease;(d) prostitutes;.

BARBADOS

See under West Indies.

BERMUDA

British subjects not Bermudians by birth must have 7 (temporarily 8) years&apos; residence in the Colony before acquiring domicile, which confers the right to carry on any trade, profession or business, to enter into employment, and be exempt from liability of deportation. Permission for undomiciled persons to enter employment is conferred in respect of a few approved forms of occupation or by special permission only. Domicile is lost if the person concerned has resided in another part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions for 7 years or more. No difficulties are placed in the way of bona fide visitors and persons of independent means wishing to take up residence. The implementation of legislation is in the hands of a statutory Board of Immigration which works more or less autonomously and interprets the law strictly.

New legislation, now passing through the Bermuda Legislature, provides for the acquisition of "Bermudian Status" for which the qualifying period of residence will be 7 years, as previously in the case of domicile. The acquisition of Bermudian Status after the qualifying period is, however, not to be automatic but at the discretion of the Governor-in-Council. For those not of Bermudian birth. Bermudian status will be lost after 5 years unless the period is extended up to 7 years by the Governor-in-Council.

BRITISH GUIANA

Any person, other than a British subject domiciled in the Colony or resident there for the preceding 2 years, who is a convicted person (as defined in the law), or whose presence in the Colony the Governor-in-Council considers to be detrimental to the preservation of peace and good order, may be prohibited from entering, or ordered to leave or be deported from the Colony.

Any immigrant may be required to make a deposit, or furnish a security bond, from B.W.I. $96 (£20) to B.W.I. $2,000 (£417) according to place of origin.

The Chief Immigration Officer may, at his discretion, require anyone entering the Protectorate to make a deposit in cash, or by bond of a sum covering the cost of either air or steamship passage from the Protectorate to the person&apos;s country of domicile.

BRUNEI, NORTH BORNEO AND SARAWAK

In all three territories any person, including a British, subject, can be refused entry if he is not sponsored or has no definite employment waiting for him, unless he is a person born in the territory who has not subsequently become an alien. Entry can also be refused to any person declared undesirable.
33&amp;The Governor of Sarawak also has power to prohibit or limit entry into the Colony of any person or class of persons in the interest of public security, or by reason of any economic, industrial, social, educational r orother conditions in the Colony.The Governor of North Borneo has power to prohibit, the entry of anyperson whose entry is considered to be to the prejudice of the inhabitants of the Colony.Intending residents for Brunei State must obtain a permit from the SeniorImmigration Officer, and permission will be granted only to those taking; upemployment in an approved occupation.For Sarawak permission is issued only for a limited category ofemployment.For North Borneo intending immigrants must obtain written, permission to enter before sailing for the Colony.Anyone entering Sarawak or North Borneo may be required to makea deposit in cash or by bond, while for Brunei there is a stipulated amountof money which an immigrant must have in his possession on arrival.CyprusBritish subjects who are not prohibited immigrants may enter the Colonywithout formality. The Chief Immigration Officer may. however, impose suchconditions, limitations or restrictions, as he may think fit, on their residence.East AfricaImmigration legislation common to the four East African territories(Kenya, Uganda. Tanganyika and Zanzibar) was enacted in 1948 and broadlymaintains the same form at present. It does not discriminate between Britishsubjects and those of other territories.Under the provisions of the legislation no one may enter a territorywho is not in possession of a valid entry permit or pass, except servingmembers of Her Majesty&apos;s Forces and their families and the accreditedDiplomadc and Consular representatives of other countries.An intending immigrant who wishes to remain in a territory for longer than 4 years (i.e., to become a &quot; permanent resident&quot;) must apply to theauthorities for one of eight classes of Entry Permits. Applications are considered by territorial Immigration Control Boards, which are appointedby the appropriate Governors in Council (and by the British Resident inZanzibar). Once having satisfied the Board that he belongs to one of the eight classes prescribed, and that his work will not be to the prejudiceof the inhabitants generally of the territory, a person (other than a prohibitedimmigrant) is entitled to be issued with an Entry Permit. Appeals against decisions of the Control Boards are heard by Immigration Appeal Tribunals,also appointed by the territorial Governors in Council (and by the british resident in Zanzibar).The eight classes of Entry Permits cover : (a) permanent residents and government ^servants, (b) farmers, (c) prospectors, (d) traders and merchants,(e) manufacturers, (/) members of certain prescribed professions (e.g., medical,dental, legal, and veterinary), (g) persons who have been offered and! have accepted employment (other than temporary employment) in a territory,and (h) persons of independent means.Provision is made in the regulations for the issue of Temporary Employ-ment Passes to cover employment in a territory for a period not exceeding4 years. These Passes are issued at the discretion of the Principal immigration officer in each territory.Certain categories of persons may be. declared prohibited immigrantsby the Principal Immigration Officers, whose decisions are . subject to
confirmation by the appropriate Governors in Council (and by the british resident in Zanzibar). These categories include destitute persons; mental defectives; those who fail to submit to a medical examination, or who arecertified to be suffering from any infectious or contagious disease whichwould make their presence in a territory dangerous to the community,convicted murderers and others who have served prison sentences; prostitutesor any person who may have received or lived on immoral earnings; anyone who enters a territory illegally. The Governors may make orders for the deportation of any persons who have been declared prohibited immigrants.Falkland IslandsThe Colonial Secretary may, at his discretion, require any person entering the Colony, who appears to be a prohibited immigrant, to make a depositin cash, or by bond, of  100.Federation of Malaya and SingaporeBoth territories have in general terms the same regulations and movement between them is unrestricted except under the Emergency Regulations.In the Federation of Malaya, apart from the Emergency Regulations,restrictions on the entry of British subjects are imposed by the Immigration(Prohibition of Entry) Orders, 1953. Their object is to ensure that nobodyis admitted whose entry is not of benefit to Malaya. With certain exceptions,of which the most important provides for the entry of wives and children of residents in Malaya, the Orders allow a British subject to enter Malayaonly if he falls within one of the following categories:  (a) he possesses professional or specialist qualifications which would enable him to earn his living in Malaya without prejudicing the interests of people already resident who hold the same qualifications;(b) he is an employee of an established firm;(c) he is a skilled artisan whose entry will be in the economic interests of malaya and whose trade or occupation is undermanned; or(d) he is any other person whose admission would in the opinion of thecompetent authorities be in the economic interests of Malaya.These restrictions do not, however, apply to a British subject who is alsoa citizen of the Federation, or who was born in Malaya or has lived there for7 of the last 10 years, or becomes a British subject by local naturalisation.These have a right of entry at any time. Nor do they apply to a temporaryvisit pass issued on condition that its holder does not take up any employment without consent of the Government.The Emergency Regulations provide that any British subject who wishes to enter the Federation must hold an entry permit, unless he is either a citizen of the Federation, or a British subject born in Malaya and ordinarily resident there who has not travelled on a foreign passport, or a servingmember of Her Majesty&apos;s armed forces, or the wife and child of such amember.SingaporeHas imposed the same restrictions with very much the same exemptions.Entry permits both to the Federation and Singapore may be refused atthe discretion of the Departments of Immigration, and security deposits maybe required against the issue of Visit Passes.

The Governor in Executive Council may, by proclamation, prohibit the landing of any class or category of persons.

Persons who wish to immigrate into the Colony must obtain a provisional entry permit from the Immigration Officer prior to leaving the country where they reside. Permission will not be granted to a person likely to prejudice the inhabitants, generally, of the Colony, by engaging in certain businesses, trades, arts or callings.

Visitors are allowed to land for a stay not exceeding 6 months, provided they are properly documented and have a return passage ticket.
The Immigration Office may refuse a landing permit to any visitor whoprior to leaving the country where he last resided failed to obtain a provisionalpermit to enter the Colony.A cash deposit of Rs. 1,000 ( 75) is required from any person entering the Colony except Government officials, visitors and persons in transit.NigeriaUnder the Nigerian (Constitution) Order-in-Council, 1954, immigration into Nigeria is a subject within the exclusive legislative competence of theFederal Government. The Federal Governments powers to control immigration are contained in the Nigerian Immigration Ordinance.Certain categories of persons are exempted including &quot;nativeforeigners&quot; i.e., Africans not indigenous, to Nigeria  as may be directed by the Governor-General. The Ordinance provides that no person to whom it applies shall enter Nigeria except on such conditions and security as maybe prescribed; and the Governor-General has absolute discretion to prohibit the entry of any person who is not a native of Nigeria (in practice the powersof declaring prohibited immigrants are exercised in Council).. The categories of prohibited immigrants do not include a native of Nigeriaor any &quot; native foreigner &quot; to whom, by direction of the Governor-General,is not to apply.British subjects need entry permits and, if entering for the first time, mustobtain prior permission. A deposit or bond equivalent to the cost of repatriation plus 25 per cent, may be required in certain cases.North BorneoSee under BruneiPitcairn IslandPrior permission to enter must be obtained from the Governor of Fiji.St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaNo one may enter St. Helena for residence or employment without a permit from the Immigration Officer, but visitors may obtain one on arrival.No person is allowed to land on Ascension Island and remain on the island beyond the period of the vessePs stay unless he has received a specialpermit signed by the Governor of St. Helena, or in case of emergencyby the Resident Magistrate oh Ascension.

West IndiesThe territories in the West Indies group are Barbados, lamaica, LeewardIslands, Trinidad and Tobago and Windward Islands.Restrictions on British subjects wishing to enter any of these territories are normally imposed under general immigration laws, but Jamaica has a specific law dealing with British subjects only. A person is held to belong to a territory if he was born there or if his parents at the time of his birthwere living there; if he has been domiciled there for 2 years; or if he hasbeen resident for at least 7 years.In all cases British subjects not belonging to the territory concerned are normally prohibited immigrants, or can be classed as such if they come within certain categories or classes of persons.In addition in all territories the Governor-in-Council has power to declarea British subject a prohibited immigrant if he is deemed undesirable either as one of a class on economic grounds or individually. There is no appeal for persons made the subject of a particular order. In the Windward islands and Barbados in the last resort the Governor has absolute discretion to prohibit the entry of any British subject who does not belong there. InTrinidad the occupations which persons who enter may be allowed to pursueare restricted. , &apos; ;&quot;&apos; Visitors&apos; temporary permits may be granted for short periods, but some form of security may be.required. In Jamaica this is normally  30 for those from the British Caribbean,  50 for those from America, Europe or africa and  100 from othersthey,- may also have to prove that they have a jobelsewhere, a return ticket and enough cash to maintain themselves during their stay.British subjects held to be prohibited immigrants may have to have theirfingerprints taken. All British subjects not belonging to the island concernedmay have to be examined by a health officer and may have to produce theirpassports or certificates of entry on demand.Windward IslandsSee West Indies.ZanzibarSee East Africa.PART IIIRESTRICTIONS ON THE ENTRY OF BRITISH SUBJECTS INTOTHE REPUBLIC OF ireland. Control over persons entering the Irish Republic is exercised underthe provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935. British subjects are, however,exempted from the requirements of the Act by virtue of an Order made bythe Executive Council in 1935 under Section 10 (1) of the Act. This providesthat British subjects and persons carrying passports of British commonwealth countries are deemed not to be aliens.There are therefore no restrictions on the entry of British subjects intothe Irish Republic.

THE SUPPLY OF MILITARY AIRCRAFTI. introduction. Public interest in the supply of aircraft in accordance with the defence programme is natural. The country has the right to be assured that thebest possible use is being made of the national resources and the large sums of money involved. The desire, however, of any Government to give in-formation must be curbed by security considerations. If every technicaldifficulty in the development of a particular aircraft is to be publiclydiscussed, it is impossible to avoid giving information to potential enemieswhich they are most anxious to possess, both to guide their own develop-ment and to enable them to assess our strength. In this White Paper theGovernment have tried to give the fullest possible information consistent withthe national safety.II. Situation in 19452. We entered the second World War with advanced designs of aircraftready to go into large-scale production. During the war we concentratedprimarily on producing large numbers of aircraft of these types and develop-ment was mainly directed towards improved versions of existing breeds of aircraft. This policy avoided the dissipation of our resources over a largenumber of experimental projects and contributed to our air strength. Butit meant that at the end of the war very few advanced projects were underdevelopment in this country, and we were falling behind in the science ofaerodynamics, though not in the field of gas turbine engines.3. Consequently, at the end of the war, both the Royal Navy and theRoyal Air Force were, with one exception, entirely equipped with piston-engined aircraft, most of which had been in service for a number of years or were developments of well established types. The exception was the jetpropelled Meteor day fighter, an early mark of which came into service in small numbers at the end of 1944.III. 1945 to 1950Re-equipment4. After the war, it was considered that the likelihood of another war was not immediate. It was therefore decided not to take a major step forward in the re-equipment of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air force with new front-line aircraft until about 1957. During the interim period theServices were to use mainly equipment of types of which they already hadlarge quantities, together with a limited number of new types based on war-time conceptions, the development of which was continued.5. Meanwhile in 1945-6 requirements were stated by the Services for aircraft of the performance and armament which they considered would be needed for operations about 1957. On the basis of these requirementsdesign of the Vulcan and Victor medium bombers was started in 1947, andthat of a swept-wing day fighter and a two-seat all-weather fighter in 1948.Steps were taken to provide interim bombers to cover the period until theVulcan and Victor were available (as explained in paragraphs 12 and 13below). But although a swept-wing Nene-engined aircraft, comparable intime and performance with the Sabre and the MIG, could have been developed, it was decided not to proceed with an interim fighter of this type. jiinrm.
6. The decision was also taken in 1946 that in the light of the limitedknowledge then available, the risks of.attempting supersonic flight in mannedaircraft were unacceptably great and that our research into the problems involved should be conducted in the first place by means of air-launchedmodels. It is easy to be wise after the event, but it is clear now thatthis decision seriously delayed the progress of aeronautical -research in theU.K.7. Various research aircraft however were ordered. These included several-of delta form to explore the behaviour of this type of aircraft at speedsnear that of sound, and two swept-wing single-seat aircraft of fighter type.In 1948 and 1949 a number of small aircraft were ordered to test in theair important features of the. designs of the Victor and Vulcan.&apos;8. The general economic and financial situation of the country was alimiting factor; in particular following devaluation in 1949 various otherresearch aircraft for experiments in flight at speeds near that of sound were cancelled for reasons of economy.&apos;9. This limitation also applied to the provision of basic research facilities.During the war only those immediately necessary for its prosecution had beenprovided. The need for extensive new facilities to deal with the problemslikely to be encountered in post-war aeronautical research had been recog-nised before the end of the war. Plans had been made for their provision,but the execution of these was delayed, owing to the competition of other claims for capital investment and the acute shortage of steel. The Tesultwas that delivery dates -for research plant were extremely long, and the neces-sary building and civil engineering wofk could *orily proceed slowly.10. The overall effect of these difficulties was that during the years from1945 to 1550 only limited new facilities were created. Total expenditureon research facilities at Ministry of Supply aeronautical research establish-ments during the whole five years was scarcely more than -that in each ofthe years 1952/53 and 1953/54, and was substantially less than the cost ofone supersonic wind tunnel now under construction at the National Aero-nautical Establishment near Bedford.Interim Operational Aircraft(a) Bombers11. The Canberra which was first projected late in 1954 was successfullydeveloped as the first jet light bomber.12. In 1946 when the long-term requirement for a medium range bomberwas under consideration, the R.A.F. stated a requirement for an &quot; insur-ance &quot; aircraft of more orthodox design to be available as quickly as possible.Prototypes were therefore ordered of a straight wing jet-engined bomber,the &apos;S.A.4. The performance of this aircraft was to be substantially belowthe long-term requirement, to meet which the Victor and Vulcan were later^ordered.13. In 1947 it was decided that a further insurance should be devolped in the form of an aircraft superior in performance to the S.Ai4 and meeting as neatly as possible the full medium bomber requirement, but of lessadvanced design than the Victor and Vulcan, so that the &quot;developmentproblems should be fewer.  This was the Valiant.14. By the end of 1949 it was thought that such good progress wasbeing made on the Valiant that the latter would be available little if at alllater than the S.A:4. In view therefore of the superior performance of the&quot;Valiant it was decided to abandon the idea of the S.A.4 as an operational aircraft.
(b) Fighters15. The Vampire came into service in 1946. More advanced marks ofthe Meteor were produced, equipped for a variety of roles. They were greatly improved compared with the original Meteor and fitted with enginesof nearly double the power. They provide an example of highly succesful and continuous development of an established type. It is these later markswhich are still in service with the R.A.F.16. In 1948 when Berlin was being blockaded and international tensionwas ;growing, production orders for the latest mark of Meteor day fighterwere more than doubled. It was also decided to develop the Venom (evolvedfrom the Vampire with thinner wing and more powerful engine) as an interim day fighter, and to proceed with a night fighter version of theMeteor.17. At the same time the question of ordering an operational version of oneof the two swept-wing single seat research aircraft was considered. It was concluded that this could not be done in either case without delaying other projects of a more advanced nature. In 1949 this was considered again but inview of the financial crisis and consequent drive for economy, no change wasmade in the earlier decision. Consequently not even a prototype of an opera-itional swept-wing fighter flew before 1951, and no prototype fully represen-tative of the production aircraft before late 1952.18. To sum up the position before the Korean War broke out, requirementsliad &apos;been stated by the Services for very advanced aircraft expected about1957; research had been restricted by inadequate facilities and the decision about manned supersonic flights : some steps had been taken to provideinterim bombers to be available before 1957 : a calculated risk had beentaken to have no interim swept wing fighters.IV.  Effect of the Korean War19. In June, 1950, war broke out in Korea. In the light of the new threat of a third World War, plans for re-equipping the Services about the yearA957 iiad to be reviewed.20. In the fighter field a substantial production order for the swept-wingday fighter referred to in paragraph 5 above was placed off the drawing board in -October, 1950, although its first prototype did not fly until 9 months later.Several hundred more were ordered in the early months of 1951. This was later named the Hunter. It was also decided as an insurance to order offthe drawing board an operational version, proposed by the makers, of research aircraft, the S.535, which it was hoped could get into productionbefore the Hunter ; prototypes and 100 production aircraft were ordered inNovember, 1950, and the production order was increased by 50 early in1951. This was later named the Swift. In the case of both the Hunter andthe Swift, the production order was placed much earlier in the developmentphase than would normally be wise.21. In the same way a. production order for the Valiant bomber was placed early in 1951, before the first prototype had flown. At the same -time it was decided to order the Sea Venom as an all-weather fighter for the fleet air Arm, and again a production order was placed before the first prototypehad flown.22. Clearly the decision to place these orders at this stage meant takingrisks. In a sense it was asking for trouble, but on the other hand it meant that some of the latest aircraft would be available earlier and could be usedin war, even if their operational performance did not completely meet theoriginal requirement.
V. Progress 1951-1955(a) Bombers23. The development of the three V-bombers has proceeded steadily.Deliveries of the Valiant have started and will continue during the coming year. Development troubles have been remarkably few for an aircraft of its size and performance, and its introduction marks a major increase in our power to deter an aggressor. Although the Vulcan and Victor are of more advanced design, good progress has been made despite setbacks throughaccidents to prototypes of each. During the coming year both development and production will proceed with growing momentum.24. The Canberra, which is in service in large numbers, marked a substan-tial advance and has proved a successful and versatile aircraft. Developmentof later marks of improved performance and for different roles has continued.(b) Fighters(i) Interim Types25. Venom Fighter Bombers, Venom Night Fighters and Meteor NightFighters have come into service; these aircraft are usefully filling the gapuntil the latest swept-wing aircraft are introduced. Although they must beregarded as interim types, they have given a worthwhile improvement inperformance over the aircraft previously in service in these roles. In particular the two-seater night fighters with their airborne and ground equipment afford a defence against night attack which we believe is superior to that of anyother country.(ii) Hunter and Swift26. In the case of the Hunter and the Swift serious development troubleswere encountered. The decisions of 1950-51 to order many hundreds of these aircraft meant that while development was still in a very early stage, toolingup and other preparations were rapidly pushed ahead for production ofswept-wing aircraft with a large number of new features, such as axial flowengines, power controls, heavier armament, and other more complicatedequipment. All these had to be introduced and developed together. They hadto be tested concurrently. Modification to one feature often meant modifica-tion to many others. This had to be done under the handicap that only afew prototypes had been ordered. A single intractable aerodynamic problem from time to time monopolised the flying time of all the available aircraft or grounded them so that all other development flying, including the flighttesting of guns, radar and other equipment, had to be put back. For instancefor a long time difficulty was experienced in making the Hunter air-brakeslow the aircraft effectively without upsetting the pilot&apos;s aim. Meanwhileproduction built up rapidly, and although this enabled early production air-craft to be diverted to assist in development flying, it also meant that increas-ing numbers of aircraft were coming off the production line while some majorfeatures of the design were still unsatisfactory.27. The first prototype of any Mark of Hunter flew in July 1951, thefirst representative prototype in November 1952. The main troubles referredto in the preceding paragraph have been largely overcome, and substantial numbers of Hunters have already been delivered to the Royal Air Force.There are still certain directions in which the Hunter&apos;s performance couldbe improved; on these development is proceeding. Apart from these thereis a problem with the guns: the firing of the guns causes interference withthe flow of air into the engine, and when this happens in the rarifiedatmosphere encountered at extreme altitude, it may lead to the enginestalling; this trouble, which has been experienced in other countries even
with more lightly armed aircraft, affects significantly only certain marks ofHunters. Measures already taken have effected a substantial improvement and further measures are in hand designed to eliminate the trouble entirely.28. We believe that in the Hunter we have a fine aircraft capable of further development. Its all round performance and heavy armament mean that itcompares favourably with any fighter now in general service in any other country.29. As explained in paragraph 20, the Swift was based on a researchaircraft built primarily to explore aerodynamic problems and not fitted withguns or other equipment. Subsequently in the emergency of 1950 it wasdecided to turn it into an operational aircraft; in addition to introducingarmament and all the rest of the operational equipment required for serviceuse, it was decided to replace the Nene engine by the larger and more power-ful Avon. The resulting changes from the original design so complicated theprocess of development as to become the basic cause of many of the difficul-ties which have been encountered.30. Production of the first mark with two guns was ordered, as has been stated, in November, 1950 ; the first prototype did not fly until July, 1952.The second mark with four guns, involving important changes to the wing,was ordered in March, 1951, but a 4-gun aircraft did not fly until May,1953 ; this was also the first aircraft representative of the Mark 4 whichwas the mark for which the largest orders were placed for the R.A.F.The aerodynamic performance of all marks proved disappointing and great efforts have been made by all concerned to get the aircraft right. Mean-while, as in the case of the Hunter, production was rapidly building up.The following two paragraphs are subject to final decisions on the Swift.31. [It has now been established by a series of exhaustive tests that theaerodynamic problems have not been solved, nor is it likely that the Swiftcan be brought in the immediate future to a standard acceptable to the RoyalAir Force. In the meantime the Hunter has emerged successfully from its development. It has therefore been decided not to introduce the earlymarks of Swift into service, but to replace them with Hunters. Had theHunter and the Swift been developed in the normal way, this switch wouldnot have been costly but, as the Swift had been ordered in large numbersa considerable time ago the decision means that use cannot be made of alarge amount of the materials prepared for the production line of Swifts.The increase in costs compared with the original plan will be in theneighbourhood of  XM.]32. [It is considered that the prospects of later marks of Swifts being suc-cessfully developed for certain specialised roles are good enough to warrant the continued development of those marks which is therefore proceeding.](iii) Future Fighters33. In the next financial year, substantial numbers of the Javelin all-weather delta fighter should become available. The development of the P.1day/night interceptor, a prototype of which has already flown faster thansound in level flight, will be pressed forward. We are looking ahead to stillmore advanced projects.(c) Other R.A.F. Aircraft34. Production models of the Beverley heavy transport are coming off theline. Helicopters for a variety of tasks including the joint Army/R.A.F.Helicopter Unit will be included in the 1955 production programme. Asmall number of Jet Provosts will be delivered in the next financial year for evaluation as basic trainers.
(d); Fleet: Air Arm35. The Royal Navy&apos;s first jet-propelled aircraft have completed their basic development; the Sea Hawk day fighter and Sea Venom all-weatherfighter have come, into service, and will be delivered in increasing numbers in the coming year. Though both are interim types, their performance is far superior to that of their forerunners ; on the other hand their design isnot so advanced as that of the R.A.F.&apos;s swept wing fighters, and their develop-ment troubles have, therefore, been less serious.36. The Wyvem strike aircraft, being the world&apos;s first military turbo-propeller aircraft, is encountering more than its fair share of developmenttroubles, particularly in regard to the engine and propeller control system.37. The Gannet anti-submarine aircraft has come into service ; some ofthe principal difficulties in its development have been due more to the multi-plicity of weapons and equipment to be carried than from advanced aero-dynamic problems. Trouble experienced in the early days of service withthe engine under certain conditions has now been eliminated, and the aircrafti&amp; a formidable submarine hunter, which will be delivered to the Navy insubstantial numbers in 1955.38. Development for the Navy of the D.H.110 all-weather fighter, and ofa twin-engine swept-wing day interceptor will continue in 1955. production orders for both types have been placed.39. Development and production preparations for substantial numbers ofhelicopters for naval use in the anti-submarine, rescue and communicationsroles will also be pressed forward.(d) Armament40. Great emphasis has been placed upon the armament element of our new weapons systems. Our latest types of fighters are fitted with four 30 mm.Aden cannon, the most destructive gun armament in service anywhere inthe world. They can deliver 10 times as much high explosive per second asthe cannon of the Russian MIG.41. The next step will be to introduce air-to-air guided weapons into our fighter defences. The progress made in developing various different types ofthese, employing a variety of guidance and homing techniques, is described in paragraphs [86-92] of the Statement on Defence, 1955 (Cmd. ). Pro-duction orders have been placed for one of these types.42. To sum up, the position in 1955 must be assessed in the: light of whata potential enemy may now have in service. The view that the services are equipped with obsolete aircraft dating from the last war is totallyincorrect. This country has an effective air defence against what any potential enemy is at present able to bring against us. By night, the most likely timefor attack, we have a better defence than anyone else in the world. Withregard to the future, during 1955 our deterrent strength will be built up with the putting into service of the Valiant bomber. Our fighter defence will be strengthened by the equipment of more squadrons with Hunters.We are developing new types of bombers, fighters and naval aircraft todeal with the expected future armament of any potential enemy. As theRoyal Navy and the R.A.F. are re-equipped with this new generation of aircraft we shall have the balanced and powerful air fighting forces appro-ptiate to our resources and our standing as a great power.(30753)  Wt. 1466-8452  101   2/55  D.L.PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN
