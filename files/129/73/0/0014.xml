IR-&apos;   (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,;secret(55) 14 COPY NO.19th January, 1955CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ONTAP.IFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the choices before us the Official Committee on the Review of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) have inE.A. (55) 4 set out with admirablelucidity a problem of considerable political and economic difficulty whichwe have to resolve.    We have to resolve it now because if we are to admit Japan to G. AeT. T. we need to try to obtain in the present negotia-tions some kind of a safeguard against calamity, and in negotiating forsuch a safeguard we should have to say that if we got it we would let her in.2,        Japanese accession to the G.A. T.T, raises substantialdifficulties whichever way we deal with it.    Abroad we risk worsening ourposition at a critical point in the development of our Far Eastern policy.At home the threat to a number of Biitish industries, particularly inLancashire where the import of grey cloth already causes bittercontroversy, is a real one.    The problem also impinges at many pointsupon our commercial relations with other members of the Commonwealth.The political dangers are great and the economic ones are notinconsiderable,3.        Broadly, there are three courses we can takesx(i)     To refuse to accept the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towardsJapan.    Under this course we should offer what we could to soften the blow, but we would not pledge ourselves toaccept her in the future or within some particular period,nor would we promise to let in Japanese goods morefreely.(ii)     To refuse to accept Japan but to give one or some or all of the things that are suggested in the official papers.These vary from making an immediate move to let inmore Japanese goods into the United Kingdom, topromising to let Japan in at some specified date and include proposals to state publicly how we could dealwith the tariff problems.(iii)     To admit Japan now, getting certain safeguards in theG.A0TaTo, the rules of which are currently under negotiation and taking such other measures as we canto assist Lancashire.I propose to deal with these courses in turn.
The dangers of Japanese accession4.        I will not repeat the arguments in the official paper.     For threeyears I have been in close contact with this problem and I am certainly ina good position to judge the political repercussions here at home of any action which we take.    The formal entry of Japan into G.A.T.T. is timedfor June and the commercial results of any action which we take willbe beginning to be felt about the autumn.    This timing is not particularlyconvenient.5.        Let me summarise some of the results if we undertake G0AoToTobligations towards Japan: they follow whether we get any safeguards against ultimate calamity or net.    Japanese grey cloth and finished piecegoods, apparel, pottery, sewing machines, low-priced cameras, buttons,canned pilchards, would sooner or later and probably sooner rather thanlater have to be admitted much more freely to the United Kingdom market.Long before actual unemployment arid other circumstances developedwhich might justify the use of any escape clause, the results of action ofthis kind would in my judgment bring about a political situation of quiteconsiderable difficulty.    My colleagues may perhaps recall the discussionsinside and outside the House of Commons which followed the signing of thelast Anglo-Japanese payments agreement.    That agreement strictly limited Japanese imports in many cases to minute quantities and wouldbe said to be as far removed from full G.A.T.T, obligations as a policyof high protection is from free trade.6.        Moreover, this political situation could have two grave consequences.    It might whip up such anti-Japanese feeling here that weshould risk losing some of the foreign policy advantages which we werehoping to gain.    Secondly, it might well put in jeopardy, both in the house and in the country, the policy on wider trade and payments which theChancellor of the Exchequer and I - with the support hitherto of industry -have been pursuing.7.        There is another matter which I should stress - I cannot in existing circumstances give any undertaking to help these industries witha higher tariff.    I will not go into the technical reasons which areadmirably brought out in the official paper.    I simply state the fact that,if we agree to accept G.A.T.T. obligations to Japan, with or without anyof the safeguards mentioned by officials, it means that most of these industries must, until we are ready to make really far-reaching changesin our tariff arrangements, face Japanese competition with no highertariffs than they have to-day.8.        Finally, as the Commonwealth Secretary will be aware, theGovernments of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa will almost certainly invoke Article XXXV in any event.    If we accept G.A.T.T.obligations to Japan (even with whatever safeguards we may be able tosecure) we shall be all the more criticised because of the divergence ofour policy from that of the three Dominions.    Moreover, we know thatthese countries are likely to reduce progressively their discrimination against Japan, to the disadvantage of our trade;  and we shall be blamedfor having given them the lead in this direction.9. So much can be said for refusing to undertake the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan. Economic self-interest and political advantage alike tend to push us in this direction.
10.       The middle of the road is often attractive but it can be a dangerous place.    I do not like the middle courses embodied in para-graphs 55-59 of E.A. (55) 4 and paragraph 7 of E, A. (55) 5.    They involvein varying degrees telling the Japanese that we cannot at this stage accept them as members of the G.A.T.T. and at the same time telling Britishindustry that we intend to do so in the future.    This seems to me toensure for us the worst of all worlds,;110 I think I would therefore summarise my objections to any of thesemiddle courses as follows:-(a) They neither satisfy the Japanese nor offer security to British industry.(b) The safeguards which involve any amendment of therules of *he G.A. T.T. almost certainly cannot be goton any other basis than thai we intend to bring Japan innow.    A pledge for the future is therefore worse in asmuch as it involves promising to bring Japan in withoutthe amendment of the G.A.T.T. rules which we regardand have stated to be necessary.(c) The real purpose underlying the delayed entry approach asa possibility suggested by officials was that we could saythat during that period we would straighten out our tariffproblem.    This straightening out would in practiceinvolve the steady elimination of free entry for Common-wealth goods.    Whatever else we say I cannot think thata general statement to this effect and in this particularcontext is practical politics at the moment.(d) Apart from the tariff question, there is no safeguard whichwe can get in the next three years which we could not get just as effectively in the next six months.At the next election it will, if we adopt these courses, be part of our policy to admit Japan into the G.A.T.T. andour candidates will be attacked on this pledge.    They willeither be asked to vote against Japanese accession or topledge themselves to terms which we shall never be ableto achieve.(f) We or our friends maybe sitting here in three years&apos;timeand the problem is unlikely to look any easier then.(g) Theory is often far harder to defend than practice.    Thetheoretical terrors of Japanese accession are, I have always thought, worse than the reality is likely to be.To seek to defend the theoretical practice of acceptingaccession in the future is to invite debate on a verytreacherous, complex and controversial ground.(h) I dislike flinching from a decision of this character.    Wemay get some credit for refusing to accept the obliga-tions of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan.    We may even getsome respect for welcoming the Japanese into theG.A.T.T.    In effect to do neither is to lay ourselvesopen to the charge of fumbling in the midst of these
123The problem of admission12.       I accordingly reject the middle course and consider in theremaining paragraphs the third course - which is to admit Japan into theG.A.T.T. with safeguards.13.       The acceptance by the United Kingdom of Japan into the G.A.T.Tat this stage is a dangerous decision which could only be justified by over-riding considerations of foreign policy.    A formidable political attack would be launched upon us and we would need to do all we could to armourselves and our supporters to meet it.    Here is the way I would propose that it could be attempted.14.       First we must get a safeguard in the G*A.T.T. which wouldenable us to take action on our own initiative in the event of disruptivecompetition causing us serious injury.    To admit Japan into the GAT.T,without any such safeguard does seem to be politically rash.    An amend-ment to Article XIX would only be a kind of long-stop device but it would help in fact and in presentation,.    We would need, in order to get itsupported by Japan and by the U.S.A., to say firmly that if we got it, andsubject to certain other safeguards which I mention below, we shouldadmit Japan under the existing procedures of the Agreement.15.       Before accepting G.A0TeT0 obligations towards Japan we should seek, and I believe could get,  rom the Japanese their concurrence incertain heads of agreement in a commercial treaty which might cover theimportant shipping clause and perhaps arrangements about the vexedquestion of copying.16.       We should tell the Japanese that, while accepting the full letterof the amended G.A.T.T, rules towards her, we did not intend in existingcircumstances to make any abrupt alteration in our trading arrangements with her.    We should proceed in the ordinary way with the re-negotiation of the Japanese Sterling Payments Agreement.    Since the Japanese havesubstantial and growing sterling balances we should say that there isno reason whatever this year for any increase in the United Kingdomquotas which would indeed be hard to justify here against such a background.17.      Nothing that we could say or do, however, would meet the argument from critics about the dangers which we would be in if japan was in the G.A.T      under conditions of convertibility.    In the interim period we could probably rely upon some discrimination in quota and throughout we could fall back in the last resort on the amendedArticle XIX, a defence which would certainly be denied to us if the middle course were adopted,IS.       On the tariff question I frankly admit my difficulties.    either the entry of Japan into the G.A.T.T., or the promise to do so, wouldgx*eatly increase the volume of criticism we are already experiencingover imports of grey cloth and would precipitate a debate in which itis probable that the nature of our tariff difficulties would be fullyexposed.    In one way or another we will, I think, inevitably be forced,once a decision to admit Japan into the GA.T.T. has been announced, to start dismantling a large part of the system of Commonwealth free entry which at present, through the operation of the no-new-preferencerule, inhibits tariff changes.
125sConclusion19.       I have naturally thought deeply as to what to advise my colleagues to do.    My advice is this.    I would prefer io refrain from extendingG.A.T.T. obligations to Japan and not at this stage make statpments ofpolicy about admitting her in future, or about the freei admission of japanese goods.    Failing this, I would move right over to the proposals outlined in paragraphs 12 to 18.    I judge that we would be wiser not to admit Japan but if we are to do so, I would prefer to do it now and defendit rather than propose it as part of our election policy and programme,,P.T.Board cf Trade, S.
