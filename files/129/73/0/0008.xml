I would therefore propose to informCOCOM that we cannot accept this solution and that we prefer to abide bythe present controls under which each country is free to authorise suchsales of new or second-hand ships as it can justify under agreed procedures.We might try to modify the present controls by seeking agreement on the embargo characteristics other than speed, and on prior consultation only for sales of ships in excess of 15^ knots trial speed.6; I am sure that this would be commercially more advantageous tous and politically defensible on one condition - that we ourselves cease to operate a unilateral embargo at any given speed limit.

EAST/WEST trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Cabinet agreed on 15th December that we should make a comprehensive proposal to the Americans as a package settlement of out-standing problems of strategic controls on East/West trade (C0 C (54) 87thConclusions, Minute 4).    The items at issue were shipping, bare copperwire and rolling mills.2.        On 10th January I received a message from Mr0 Stassen whichnaturally welcomed in the main our suggestion on shipping but rejecting any idea of a package deal and refusing to come any way to meet us on the other1items.

Most of the problems are well known already to my colleagues.,I need not therefore set them out again at length.    I put forward the following suggestions for dealing with them.3hdjD in&amp;5. .      Except in the context of a package deal I do not see how we candefend the proposed agreement of the Co-ordinating Committee of the paris group (COCOM) with its discrimination against the United Kingdom by thespecial exception in respect of fast ships for Denmark and the objectionableegalitarianism in national quotas.    I would therefore propose to informCOCOM that we cannot accept this solution and that we prefer to abide bythe present controls under which each country is free to authorise suchsales of new or second-hand ships as it can justify under agreed procedures.We might try to modify the present controls by seeking agreement on the embargo characteristics other than speed, and on prior consultation only for sales of ships in excess of 152 knots trial speed.6. I am sure that this would be commercially more advantageous tous and politically defensible on one condition - that we ourselves cease to operate a unilateral embargo at any given speed limit.    On 15th Decembercopy no/tjSECRETC.(55) 818th January, 1955cabinet
the First Lord of the Admiralty told us that the Naval Staff would not nowpress for this embargo below 16 knots,    I would suggest-, howevers that ourshipbuilders and ship-owners must henceforth be free to sell ships wnichare as fast as those sold by any other member of COCOM.    It is indeeddifficult in the circumstances to see what strategic purpose would be served by any other policy.Copper Wire7o        Our experts are agreed that the problem of bare copper wire isquite distinct from that of communication equipment.    I would therefore suggest that we do not make the offer of a formal &quot;amber light&quot; procedure(under which we would re-examine the need for quantitative controls whenexport approvals in 1955 reached a figure of 50,000 tons) which I was authorised to propose as part of the package deal.    In the context of any new controls over cables, an &quot;amber light&quot; at 50,000 tons would be mostunpopular, particularly as it would involve the restoration of a control theremoval of which we announced last summer.    Instead we should immediatelymake clear in COCOM that we think the normal List III procedure is adequate and that we should be willing to join in discussion at any time thatthe UsSoA. or any other country thought that the level of exports justified it.The present temporary procedure of prior notification would, of course,no longer apply.8.        As to the Russian order, placed with Crompton Parkinson for24,000 tons of bare copper wire, on which we have limited ourselvesunilaterally to authorising only 6,000 tons, I would propose to tell thecompany to go ahead with the balance.Rolling Mills9.        I have told Mr. Stassen that we have made an offer which goesbeyond the limit which we considered justified for strategic reasons and that,in particular, we cannot defend the continued embargo over the tinplatemill which industrial and public opinion will not regard as non-strategic.Mr. Stassen emphasised his own political difficulties and all he was ableto offer was that our joint defence experts should examine the problem once more.10.       I doubt if any good will come out of such a further examination.But we are in a weak position tactically because all rolling mills are now onthe embargo list and we can only free them by a unanimous vote in COCOMQI would therefore recommend that we agree to immediate discussions by our defence experts, while making clear to the Americans that we reserve the right thereafter to table our own proposals in COCOiVi and possibly alsoto apply for a special exception in the case of the tinplate mill.Electric Generators110       The position here briefly is that in the summer we agreed to an american request to embargo generators over 10,000 kcw. even though wewere not convinced by the American argument that these were of vitalimportance to the development of Russia&apos;s atomic energy programme.    Butthe French and Belgians only accepted this embargo as a temporary measure and the Americans have now, without consulting us, offered to reduce the embargo area to generators above 60,000 k. w,,, but on condition that v/eaccept quantitative controls between 5,000 and 60,000 k1 w. and eitherquantitative controls or embargo over a wide range of prime movers,,
12.       The restoration of controls in the 5,000 to 10,000 k. w, range3 sorecently freed, will be criticised by our traders.    Moreover, quantitativecontrols are objectionable in so far as they involve the parcelling out ofnational quotas.    Nevertheless, the American compromise on the electricgenerators will probably give us a commercial advantage over embargoat 10,000 k, w, and I am prepared to accept it.    Our officials are, however,agreed that there is no case for introducing controls over the prime moversand we should therefore stand firm with other countries against these newcontrols.Communications Equipment13.       Finally, there is the question of communications equipments    the americans want us to embargo a whole list of cables and wires ranging from co-axial cable in one direction to lighting flex and bare copper wirein the other.    They assert that this is necessary to hinder the Russiansfrom completing their long-distance operational communications and fromputting their normal long-distance communications underground.    TheChiefs of Staff have recommended an embargo over co-axial cable andmultipair cable as suggested by the Americans, and also of carrierfrequency repeater equipment which the Americans did not mention^ but have said that there is no need to go beyond this. --14.       I am net myself convinced of the case for embargo in this field,,It is admitted, even by the Americans, that it will be difficult to justifythis under the agreed COCOM criteria and it will be equally difficult forus here to defend the loss of Russian orders valued at between 5 and  7 millions which EnfieId Cable and G,E0Co have been negotiating with our full authority, particularly as we may not be able to disclose infull the reasons for the new embargo,15.      Nevertheless, I recognise that some action may be needed in ourown interest and as a concession to the Americans.    I would be prepared toaccept an embargo over co-axial cable and the carrier frequency repeaterequipment.    I would not, at this stage at any rate, think it necessary toembargo also the muitipair cable.    This may be useful to the Russiancommunications plan; but the fact remains that it is the ordinary telephonecable used and known all over the world for a very long time.16.       In my discussion with Mr. Stassen, I agreed that there should be afurther examination of the communications field by our joint experts, while making clear that we regarded it as being distinct from the copper andbare wire field.    This joint study should be completed shortly and i suggest that we defer a final decision on whether or not to control themultipair cable until we have the experts 1 report.17.      One point remains to be explained in this field.    Other countries are known to be negotiating Russian orders for co-axial and multipaircable.    Any embargo in this field will therefore be difficult to obtain inCOCOMo   Pending a decision we shall be at a considerable disadvantagebecause we had asked Enfield Cable and G0E. C. to stall in their current negotiations with the Russians,    Because of the nature of our real reasonsfor control, we should have to join with the Americans in diplomaticrepresentations (to be made without delay) to the countries most concernedbefore tabling a joint proposal in COCOM,   But this would have to be onthe clear understanding -
q(a) that we would expect the Americans to limit their proposals to such parts of the field as we are preparedto accept, e^en though they expressed their own. viewthat the controls should go further;(b) that we cannot operate a unilateral control,,    If&apos; othercountries are not prepared to accept this new embargo(and to prevent the shipment of any prior commitments)we must reserve the right to permit exports ourselves,,I would, of course, consult my colleagues again, at that stage.18.       If my colleagues approve these proposals, I suggest that we should inform the Americans of the policy we intend to pursue on each item-,    Butwe should not invite or wait for their comments.    We should, eitherimmediately or after the further report of the experts as the case may be^take the necessary action in COCOM, where our views on electric generatorsand bare copper wire in particular are urgently awaited in order thatfinal decisions may be taken.19.       We ought not to under-estimate the difficulties which theseproposals will create for us, or the loss in exports which may follow,,    i fear that our critics will regard these new controls as resulting from american pressure and as a step back from the policy of reducing the strategic lists which we carried through last summer,20.      Soviet bloc countries are likely to regard these new controls asthe beginning of a long process of extending the strategic lists * and such afear would be fully justified by their and our experience in the years1949-53.    The indirect effects upon East/West trade are ttterefore likelyto be far greater than the immediate loss in orders.    We can only justify our action in the interests of Anglo/American relations and in the hopethat this will be reflected in the United States attitude when we come todiscuss control over exports to China.F.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,17th January, 1955,
