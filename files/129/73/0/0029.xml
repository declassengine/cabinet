REVISED PROOF\

Statement on Defence, 1955I.-introduction. Overshadowing all else in the year 1954 has been the emergence ofthe thermo-nuclear bomb. This has had, and will continue to have, far-reaching effects on United Kingdom defence policy. Nevertheless our problem is still fundamentally a dual one. We have to prepare against the risk ofa world war, and it is on the nature of these preparations that theexistence of thermo-nuclear weapons has its main effect. At the same time wemust continue to play our part in the defence of the interests of the free world as a whole, and particularly of the Commonwealth and Empire, in the &quot; cold war &quot;; and we must meet the many other peacetime commitments overseasarising from our position as a great Power with world-wide responsibilities.2. In the Statement on Defence, 1954, Her Majesty&apos;s Government set out their views on the effects of atomic weapons on United Kingdom policy andon the nature of war. Shortly afterwards the United States Governmentreleased information on the experimental explosion at Eniwetok, in November1952, of a thermo-nuclear weapon many hundred times more powerful thanthe atomic bombs which were used at Nagasaki and Hiroshima&apos;in 1945. On1st March, 1954, an even more powerful thermo-nuclear weapon was explodedin the Marshall Islands. There are no technical or scientific limitations onthe production of nuclear weapons still more- devastating.3. The United States, Government have announced that they are proceeding with full-scale production of thermo-nuclear weapons. We haveno doubt that the Soviet Government will follow the same policy; though we cannot tell when they will have thermo-nuclear weapons available for operational use. The United Kingdom also has the ability to produce suchweapons and after fully considering all the implications of this step theGovernment have decided to proceed with their development and production.4. The power of these weapons is such that accuracy of aim assumes less importance; thusxattacks can be delivered by aircraft flying at great speed and at great heights. This greatly increases the difficulty of defence andother means of delivery can be foreseen which will, in time, present even greater problems.5. If such weapons were used in war, they would cause devastation,both human and material, on an unprecedented scale. If exploded in theair, a hydrogen bomb would destroy a wide area by blast and thermalradiation. If exploded on the ground, the destruction by blast and thermalradiation would be somewhat less; but there would be additional extremely serious indirect effects. A great mass of atomised particles would be suckedinto the air. Much of it would descend round the point of the explosion,but the rest would be carried away and descend as radio-active &quot; fall-out.&quot;The effect on those immediately exposed to it without shelter wouldcertainly be fatal within the areas of greatest concentration of the &quot; fall-out &quot;;it would become progressively less serious towards the outer areas of the47504 b* 2
affected region. Large areas would be devastated and many more rendereduninhabitable. Essential services and communications would suffer wide-spread interruption. In the target areas, central and local Governmentwould be put out of action. Industrial production, even when undertakingswere not partially or wholly destroyed, would be gravely affected by the disruption of power and water supplies and by the interruption of the normalcomplex inter-flow of materials and components. There would be serious problems of control, feeding and shelter. Public morale would be mostseverely tested.  It would be a struggle for survival of the grimmest kind.6. It is essential that these facts should be known not only to our peoplebut to all the world. All should know the magnitude of the disaster war would bring. Such knowledge may bring home to people in all lands theconsequences of war and generate a compelling will to peace which willenforce itself on the most arbitrary of rulers. That is the first implicationof the nuclear weapon; it is one not of despair but of hope. In the handsof the free world, which at present has a marked superiority both in theweapon itself and in the means of delivering it, and which has no thought of aggression, it is a most powerful deterrent. In the Government^ consideredview this deterrent has significantly reduced the risk of war on a major scale.7. Our duty and our policy are clear. To build up our own forces, inconjunction with those of our allies, into the most powerful deterrent wecan achieve. By this means to work for peace through strength. Thus weshall hope to obtain real disarmament and relaxation of tension. But wemust also so equip and train our forces and so organise the country as toenable us to survive and to defeat the enemy if all our efforts for peaceshould fail.8. The Government will continue to work for a practical scheme of &quot;disarmament as a contribution to the alleviation of international tension andthe avoidance of war. Their ultimate aim is abolition of the use, possessionand manufacture not only of all nuclear weapons, but also of other weapons of mass destruction, together with simultaneous major reductions of conven-tional armaments and armed forces to agreed levels which would redressthe present Communist superiority.9. The whole programme would have to be carried out to an agreedtimetable, and an essential feature would be the provision of machinery to supervise and enforce agreed prohibitions and reductions. Detailed proposals on these lines have been put forward by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in recentyears. Until recendy, however, there has been no indication that the SovietGovernment were ready even to entertain any workable scheme; indeed, therewere many indications to the contrary. In September, 1954, however, theSoviet Government announced that they were prepared to accept &quot; as a basis &quot;certain proposals put forward last June by Her Majesty&apos;s Government inconjunction with the French Government. The recent debates in the united nations General Assembly indicates that they are still not prepared to agreeto the essential safeguards provided in these proposals although it is hopedthat in the forthcoming discussions they will be ready to discuss disarmamentmore realistically. If the free world disarmed without such safeguards itwould incur a double risk. It would be threatened with conventional forces which it could not hope to match; and it would have no guarantee that such
forces would not be reinforced by nuclear weapons over the clandestineproduction of which there would be no adequate control. In short, disarma-ment must be real and comprehensive and there must be secure and workablesafeguards. Until the Communist world is prepared to accept such a systemour &quot; Grand Alliance &quot; must build and maintain its strength.10. The deterrent to aggression does not consist in military strengthalone. The political unity and resolution and the economic as well as the physical strength of the free world must be maintained. This has been thebasis of our policy ever since the clear emergence of the Communist threatafter the last war. On it were founded first the Brussels Treaty of 1948and then the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. To this end, too, theagreements resulting from the London and Paris Conferences are of supreme importance. Their ratification will enable Western Germany tomake her essential contribution of forces, under suitable safeguards. Theywill also, by &quot; recognising that a great country can no longer be deprived of the rights properly belonging to a free and democratic people &quot; and byassociating the Federal Republic as an equal partner in Western european union and in N.A.T.O., strengthen the solidarity and unity of purpose ofthe Western European and North Atlantic communities.11. The United Kingdom&apos;s undertaking, subject to the ratification ofthe agreements and to certain other understandings, to maintain her forces on the mainland of Europe, contributed powerfully to the success of theLondon and Paris Conferences, and will certainly continue to strengthen the stability and effectiveness of N.A.T.O. and Western European Union. TheBritish initiative was followed (and this was not the least important resultof the Conferences) by an expression by Mr. Dulles of the willingness ofthe United States to consider giving complementary assurances regardingthe continued maintenance of United States forces in Europe.12. Further evidence of the desire to unite for mutual protection against possible aggression is provided by the conclusion of the South-East AsiaCollective Defence Treaty. The development of this organisation, which isabout to be further discussed in Bangkok, should contribute much to the stability of this troubled area.13. Naturally it is within the Commonwealth that we may look for thefullest co-operation in defence. The closest liaison is maintained at theservice level with other Commonwealth countries between whose forces there is considerable standardisation of equipment, weapons and trainingtechniques. Besides frequent inter-Governmental consultation, of which therecent meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers is an example, regularService conferences are held and there is close and intimate co-operationwith the individual countries concerned over regional planning and strategy.14. Political unity and armed strength would be of little value if the will of the free peoples to maintain, and if necessary, to defend, their independence and way of life were in doubt. For this reason economic,social and political progress must be maintained and consolidated, particularlyin the less developed countries, which otherwise might be undermined by communist infiltration and subversion.
15. It is certainly no part of the Governments policy to abandonresistance to Communist imperialism in the cold war. Weakness andirresolution in the face of aggression falling short of a major war will notavail to avert such a war. The existence of the nuclear weapon may discourageovert armed intervention by the Communist Powers, such as occurred in korea, because of the risk that it might develop into unlimited war. Butequally it may encourage the indirect approach, through infiltration andsubversion, and thus paradoxically increase the tempo of the cold war. Weshall therefore, in parallel with our effort to develop the deterrent and toprepare for a major war, require to strengthen by all means at our disposal,including, where necessary the maintenance of large conventional forces, ourdefences against this method of attack. By doing this we can play our part with the other countries of the Commonwealth and with our Allies in resisting the spread of Communism throughout the world.16. The United Kingdom is also responsible for many dependent territories overseas and must be ready not only to defend them against external aggression but also to provide armed forces in support of the civil power against threats to internal security. The rapid transition through which many colonial societies are now passing in their progress towards self-government creates conditions which are in some cases capable of being exploited by international Communist techniques. This immediately, butas we hope only temporarily, must increase the actual and potentialcommitments for British forces in support of Colonial Governments andAdministrations. At the same time the measures already being taken tostrengthen the ability of the Colonial Governments themselves to deal withthreats to internal security must be progressively improved. ^17. Our reduced commitments in Trieste, Korea, and the Middle East,now make it possible to rebuild a strategic reserve of land forces in thiscountry. Coupled with the mobility of the Navy, and increasing use of air transport, this will greafly increase our ability to exercise our world-wideresponsibilities effectively and economically.18. Meanwhile, in a situation in which the Communist world maintainslarge and increasingly powerful armed forces, the strength of our forces andthose of our Allies must also be developed and sustained against thepossibility of a major war. In this development increasing emphasis mustbe placed on the deterrent.19. This deterrent must rest primarily on the strategic air power of theWest, armed with its nuclear weapons. The knowledge that aggression willbe met by overwhelming nuclear retaliation is the surest guarantee that itwill not take place.20. This offensive strength is also our most effective defence against aggression, should it ever occur. The enormous power of nuclear weaponsis such that in war the outcome of the first few exchanges wouldbe of critical importance. Great advantages would probably flow fromsurprise and from the first assault. In these circumstances the enemy mightwell initiate the use of nuclear weapons at the outset of hostilities. Aprompt and overwhelming counter-offensive with the most powerful weaponsavailable offers at present the surest means of limiting the scale of such attacks.
21. But we cannot rely only on strategic air power. Our policy mustaim at impressing on the potential enemy that a sudden attack even withnuclear weapons would not be conclusive. It must demonstrate that we have both the will to survive and the power to ensure victory. The vastconventional forces controlled by the Communist world include a great and growing Navy. We too must have a Navy capable of dispersal andconcentration at will which, with the Allied navies, can seek out and destroy the enemy&apos;s naval forces and preserve effective command of sea communications.22. The Communist world also maintains and can continue to maintain a great preponderance of conventional land forces operating, moreover, on internal lines of communications. The Soviet Union and her eastern european Satellites have some six million men under arms backed byenormous reserves. On the German front the Soviet Army could be increasedto well over 100 divisions within 30 days and over the whole field ofdeployment East and West the Soviet and Satellite land forces could be raised to the level of 400 divisions. The free world cannot put into the front lineanything comparable to this strength in conventional forces. The use of nuclear and atomic weapons is the only means by which this massivepreponderance can be countered. But with their aid we can adopt a forwardstrategy on the ground in Europe with good hope of preventing the over-running of the Continent. We can defend the Continent instead ofcontemplating again a grim process of liberation. But if we do not use thefull weight of our nuclear power Europe can hardly be protected frominvasion and occupation with all that this implies both for Europe and theUnited Kingdom.23. It was for these reasons that the Council of the North atlantic treaty Organisation, at its meeting in Paris in December 1954, approved areport by the Military Committee on the most effective pattern of N.A.T.O.military strength which assumed the use, against a war of aggression, of atomic and nuclear weapons. The report will, henceforward, form the basisof N.A.T.O. defence planning and preparations. Decisions on putting suchplans into effect are specifically reserved to Governments.24. Thus, until the Soviet Union agrees to participate in a secure systemof disarmament, the free nations must base their plans and preparations onthe assumption that if a major war were precipitated by an attack upon themthey would have to use all the weapons at their disposal in their defence.The consciences of civilised nations must naturally recoil from the prospectof using nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, in the last resort, most of us mustfeel that determination to risk the threat of physical devastation, even on the immense scale which must now be foreseen, is manifestly preferable to an attitude of subservience to militant Communism, with the national and individual humiliation that this would inevitably bring. Moreover such ashow of weakness or hesitation to use all the means of defence at our disposalwould not reduce this risk.   All history proves the contrary.25. We must therefore contribute to the deterrent and to our own defence by building up our own stock of nuclear weapons of all types andby developing the most up-to-date means of delivery. We must, moreover,in making our plans for dealing with aggression against our alliance, not
zmflinch from the necessity to use these weapons. For in the knowledge of ourresolve lies the best hope, and it is a real hope, that it may never be put tothe test.26. Nevertheless the use of naval and land forces in a war involvingnuclear weapons is not outmoded. Their weapons, organisation, tacticsand training will be profoundly affected. But the Navy is still required to contain and destroy enemy forces at sea so as to allow free movement ofsupplies and troops and to give both our land and air forces support in their operations. We still need troops on the ground, too, to hold the enemy well tothe East in Europe in the vital initial stages of a war. This would give timefor the effects of our strategic air offensive to be felt; it would hold back from the United Kingdom the threat of shorter-range aircraft and ground-to-ground missiles. The presence of a firm shield of troops and tactical aircraftalso reduces the danger that the Communists might be tempted to try toover-run Europe with conventional forces in the hope that the West wouldrefrain from using nuclear weapons in its defence or that it would be used as a pawn in a shameful negotiation. It is from this point of view that thebuilding up of German Armed Forces is militarily so important.27. At the same time we must make all possible provision for the defence and continued functioning of the home base. This will demonstrate thatwe have the will to survive and have no intention of surrendering even if itshould come to nucloar warfare. For this purpose the R.A.F. fighter command must be armed with the most powerful aircraft and weapons wecan develop and maintained at a high state of readiness. Home defence is no less vital than before. It is true that its character has changed. Itis no longer a question of dealing with the local and isolated incidents. Thewhole country, the Services no less than the civilian population, is involved and must be organised accordingly. The Services must be-trained, local .civilian organisations developed, and there must be a link between the two.For this purpose the Government have decided to form a Mobile DefenceCorps as part of the Army and R.A.F. reserve forces.28. We also need defensive strength to take toll of the enemy if he attacks.For this purpose the Reserve Army, apart from its overseas commitments to N.A.T.O. and for other purposes, will continue to play a vital role. within our resources, of course, full preparedness in all these fields is not possible.We must apply flexible and carefully assessed priorities.29. The discharge of our many overseas commitments in cold war conditions must continue to absorb a large share of the resources whichwe can make available for defence. For the rest we must, in our allocation of resources, assign even greater priority to the primary deterrent, thatis to say, to the production of nuclear weapons and the means of theirdelivery. Other elements of our defence effort must be adjusted to conform to these priorities and we must, in particular, eliminate those parts of our forces which have become or are becoming obsolete in modern conditions.We must have regard also to the kind of v/ar in prospect and here thegoverning factor is the critical importance of the initial phase. We cannot,however, be sure that the initial phase will be decisive; certainly all our efforts must be directed to securing that it is not decisive against us. some provision, though on a lower priority, must therefore be made for continuingoperations after the initial phase, particularly at sea.
II-THE PROGRAMMES OF THE SERVICES33. This broad review of the strategic implications of the thermo-nuclearweapon does not radically alter the role of any of the three fighting Services.Each has a contribution to make to the three main aims of our defence policy to build up the deterrent against aggression, to fight the cold war, andto prepare for a major war in case it should come to that.34. Their roles in these three contexts are not competitive butcomplementary. Moreover, particularly in considering their preparations for a major war we must always remember that we shall not fight alone butas a member, though a leading member, of a great alliance. Thus, within limits, the pattern of our own forces must conform to that of the whole. Itis nevertheless possible to describe the contribution of each of the services to these three main aims.35. The main contribution to the deterrent is made by the Royal AirForce whose primary task now is to build up the V-Bomber Force, with itsnuclear potential, to the highest possible state of efficiency and preparedness.The first squadrons of V-bombers will be introduced during this year.36. The Navy also makes its contribution of heavy carriers to the alliedstriking fleet whose great mobility and offensive power, to be augmented byguided missiles and by the other modern equipment which is under develop-ment, will add powerfully to our ability to hit the enemy either independentlyor in support of allied land and land-based air forces.47504 c*30. To sum up there are, in the first place, certain to be difficulties anddangers in continued co-existence with the Communist i-owers whose long-term aims and whose conduct and creed are fundamentally opposed to ourown. The monolithic nature of the Communist system seems to remainbasically unaltered. Its military strength continues to grow at an impressiverate. On the surface their policies may appear, from time to time, moreaccommodating. But their actions have so far provided no real ground for believing that the threat to the free world has sensibly diminished.31. These difficulties may, however, be overcome if we are patient andresolute and these dangers avoided if we are united, vigilant and prepared.We must neither be lulled into a false sense of security, nor frightened intoa state of paralysis, nor tempted into hasty or ill-considered action by meansof provocation.32. Above all, if the free world stands together determined, if necessaryto defend itself with all its resources, then the nuclear weapon, m the words of the Prime Minister, &quot; increases the chances of world peace far more thanthe chances of world war.&quot; There seems reason to hope that this willremain true even when the present great predominance of the West both in stocks of nuclear weapons and in the means of delivering them has beenreduced. In fact, from a universal realisation that the results of a major war can only be utterly disastrous for both sides may emerge a new hope.The armed truce of recent years may develop through &quot;co-existence&quot; intoreal peace.
37. The importance of strong land forces prepared for instant action inthe defence of Western Europe has already been explained. They are no lessan essential part of the deterrent in other parts of the world.38. The main burden of the cold war and of our other peacetimemilitary commitments in the Colonial Empire is borne by the Army whether in active operations against Communist guerillas in Malaya, in helping to restore law and order as in Kenya, or in maintaining confidence and stability elsewhere, for example in the Middle East. For these purposesconventional forces and conventional arms are required.39. The Army is now able to build up a strategic reserve in the UnitedKingdom. This has for long been a primary aim of our defence policy;it is essential both in the cold war and in our preparedness for a major war. In the cold war it can be used promptly to restore situations whichmight otherwise grow into serious or lasting commitments. It will alsoreduce the present high proportion of overseas service in the Army. And inthis way, through concentration and the improved training facilities available in this country, it will increase the standard of efficiency.40. The task of the Navy is, as it always has been in peace-time, to sustain our foreign and colonial policy. The presence of Naval forces is often sufficient to provide a steadying influence. The Navy is moreoveressential to the support of our strategic reserve. And in more serious, but still limited, conflicts of the Korean type it can provide quickly, by reasonof its mobility, powerful assistance to the land battle.41. The value of the R.A.F. in the cold war is exemplified by the squadrons now engaged in active operations both in Kenya and in the far east. (In Malaya the Naval Helicopter Squadron continues to give valuable assistance.) The overseas commands of the R.A.F. are receiving newequipment and will continue to maintain close liaison with other Common-wealth Air Forces. Great emphasis is placed on mobility, and the ability to reinforce overseas theatres with all types of aircraft at short notice is constantly improving. Special attention is being paid to the re-equipment of Transport Command so as to provide increased mobility for the strategicreserves of both land and air forces as well as greater capacity forco-operation with the Army in tactical airborne operations.42. If itxshould come to a major war the initial stage will be of critical importance. In this initial stage the primary role will fall to the Air Force.But the tasks of the Navy and of the Army will also be vital. Above all,the highest possible state of readiness in all the three Services is essential.43. We rely upon the striking power of the Air Force for an immediate and decisive counter-blow; for a major contribution to the defence of thiscountry against air and sea attacks, and for air support to the allied front inEurope.44. The threat of nuclear attack clearly presents grave problems to our air Defence Forces. The control and reporting system in the UnitedKingdom, the overhaul of which was begun at the outset of the rearmamentperiod, and which is already highly developed, will be further improved.The expansion of Fighter Command has been completed.  Its re-equipment
is now proceeding. The balance of the Command will be improved by afurther increase in the proportion of all-weather radar-equipped fighters.High priority continues to be given to the development of guided missiles.Orders have been placed for air-to-air guided weapons and progress is beingmade with the development of other types.45. The 2nd Tactical Air Force will be maintained at the highest possibleefficiency in support of the front in Europe. Improvements will be made inthis force so as to increase its fighting capacity. Coastal Command will be strengthened by the addition of some Seamew aircraft for short-range anti-submarine reconnaissance.46. Throughout the R.A.F., means to improve the state of immediatereadiness are constantly being studied and applied. To this end, aircrew withrecent flying experience in operational squadrons are now earmarked asimmediate reserves. Changes are being made in the organisation of the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force. Reserve ground personnel are being organised intoReserve Flights for individual regular stations. They will report to these stations immediately in emergency or on mobilisation.47. Our Army in Europe, which will be maintained at a strength of4 Divisions, is being organised, trained and equipped with a wide variety of up-to-date weapons. But the threat of hot war is not limited to Europe.The Army must plan and prepare for eventualities which may arise in theMiddle East or the Far East as well.48. The main effect of nuclear weapons on the land battle is greatly toincrease the need for flexibility so as to be able to move from dispersionto concentration as quickly, and with as little confusion, as possible.Greater elasticity of outlook by Commands at all levels will be required;the organisation of fighting units and their equipment also need modification.Experimental organisations and a revised scale of weapons and equipment,including transport, are being worked out. These will be tried out inmanoeuvres this year. The organisation of supporting arms and services willalso have to be adjusted to enable them to back up the fighting units.49. In the field of Anti-Aircraft Defence it has become obvious thatanti-aircraft guns can no longer be deemed effective against the speed andheight of aircraft carrying thermo-nuclear weapons in attacks on areatargets. Consequently, as already announced, the A.A. Command structure in the United Kingdom is being abolished. Anti-aircraft guns will still,however, be needed in the field and for the local defence of certain vitaltargets against which the most likely threat is from precision bombing.50. In a major war, the task of the Navy would be to secure the sea communications without which we cannot, for long, survive. The rapid and spectacular build-up of Soviet naval forces increases the difficulty ofthis task. For this purpose we need a fleet of ships and naval aircraftstrongly equipped with the latest weapons, well trained and ready to fightfrom the outset of war. Special attention is therefore being given to immediate readiness. In particular, a radical reorganisation of the reservefleet is now in progress. The emphasis will now be put on those ships which are, or can be made, ready for almost immediate service in an47504 C* 2
emergency and all these will be refitted and maintained at the shortest possiblenotice. Consideration is also being given to the further dispersal of theReserve Fleet both within and outside the United Kingdom.51. The nature of the tasks to be undertaken by the forces stationed in the United Kingdom in the critical initial stage of a future warrequires review. Even under conditions of nuclear attack some of these will be engaged on Service duties of absolute priority, for example, in the bomber counter-offensive; in the Air Defence of the United Kingdom; in getting the Navy to sea; in reinforcing, to the extent that is practicable,overseas theatres of war and in particular the Western front in Europe, andin protecting this island against airborne invasion. The Territorial, as wellas the Regular, Army will have a vital role to play. It is clear, however that service units at home not directly employed in operations would have to beused largely to aid the civilian population. Plans to enable them to carryout this task are, therefore, being developed. Section VIII of this Statementdeals with these plans in more detail and outlines the proposed functions and organisation of the Mobile Defence Corps.52. Within the limit of our resources, therefore, we are planning for abetter equipped and maintained Active Fleet and a reduced but much more highly prepared Reserve Fleet; a smaller, better disposed, more mobileArmy; and a more powerful Air Force including, in particular, an effectivestrategic bomber force. All these forces must be armed with the mostmodern weapons.III.-FINANCE53. Despite the economic progress of the United Kingdom in the past ,year, the Government must continue to bear in mind the broad economicsituation, since the importance of maintaining a balance between the demandsof defence and other claims on our resources necessarily imposes a financiallimitation on the defence programme. As explained in the Statement on defence, 1954, our balance of payments is also affected, directly by our overseas military expenditure and indirectly through the diversion ofproduction resources from exports and capital equipment. The defence programme has been reviewed over the past year in the light of these considerations, as well as of the strategic background outlined above.54. There are two further relevant factors. The first is the progressive reduction in the external economic aid on which we have hitherto been ableto rely. The second is the probability that, from about the beginning of thefinancial year 1956-57, the bulk of the local costs of our forces in germany will no longer be met by contributions from the Federal Republic and will fall on our own Defence Budget. Both have budgetary and balance ofpayments implications.55. There are also certain military considerations which affect thecharacter of next year&apos;s Defence Budget. First the risk of a major war in theimmediate future appears to have receded; this applies particularly to thepresent period of Western predominance in nuclear capability. This argumentmust not be carried too far; the reduction of international tension in the past
Summary of Estimates 1955-5660. The following tables compare the estimates for 1955-56 with those for 1954-55.

We must not reverse this trend. But the present situation enablessome reductions to be made in production for the forces, partly of interimtypes of weapons and other items of equipment; and pardy of those regardedas less essential in the type, and especially the initial phase, of any major war as now foreseen.56.   Secondly, the decision to abolish Anti-Aircraft Command will leadto a reduction in expenditure.--* &apos;- scifi-SiI   io57.   Thirdly, a fairly considerable decline in the manpower of the armed forces, particularly in the Army, is foreseen which will be accompanied,(also mainly in the case of the Army) by measures of reorganisationmade possible by the reduction in our overseas commitments now in progress.These reductions will themselves lead ultimately to further economies butthey will largely be offset in the year immediately ahead by increasedcapital and movement costs arising from redeployment.58. In addition, the Defence Estimates for 1953-54 were, and those for1954-55 will be, considerably underspent mainly because of developmentdifficulties associated with the newer equipments and also because ofunavoidable delays in works services. The experience gained in the last twoyears of a whole range of factors which condition the rate of expenditurein these fields has been taken into account in preparing the estimates for1955-56.59. Taking all these factors into account, the total of the Defence Budgetproposed for 1955-56 (not allowing for receipts from American Aid) is 1,537-2 million compared with  1,639-9 million for 1954-55. allowing for American Aid the figures are  1,494-2 million for 1955-56 comparedwith  1,554-54 million for 1954-55.

This aid, which is of four types, has been allotted as follows:    million	Navy	Army	Air Force	total defence Support Aid	3	5		8Agricultural Commodity Aid   ..	3-5	5		8-5Special Aircraft Purchase			16-5	16-5Additional R.A.F. Programme ..			10	10	6-5	10	26-5	43The nature of Defence Support Aid and Agricultural Commodity Aid was.described in paragraph 21 of the Statement on Defence 1954 (Command 9075).Receipts in these categories in 1954-55 will be lower than expected and theamounts provided for 1955-56 represent the balances outstanding, togetherwith  6 million of Defence Support Aid previously allotted to the UnitedKingdom and expected to accrue in 1955-56. The provision for SpecialAircraft Purchase ( 16-5 million) is made up of two elements. Firstly, the 30-36 million provided in the 1954-55 Estimates and described inparagraph 21 of Command 9075 will not all be received in that year, and the1955-56 provision therefore takes account of the balance still to be received.Secondly, legislation passed by the United States Congress in 1954 providesthat surplus agricultural commodities to the value of $35 million may be sold to the United Kingdom and the sterling proceeds used by the United StatesGovernment for payments in respect of military aircraft manufactured in theUnited Kingdom and required by the United Kingdom forces for the defenceof the North Atlantic area. The provision of  16-5 million includes thosereceipts estimated to accrue in 1955-56 under this new arrangement, uponwhich, however, final decisions remain to be taken by the two Governments.The remaining item of aid is  10 million in respect of aircraft and equipment to be bought, under contracts already placed, from Her Majesty&apos;s government by the United States Government, and to be made available to the Royal AirForce in support of the expansion and modernisation of that Service. The 10 million covers the initial part of a programme from which receipts areto be spread over approximately three years.

In the Statement on Defence 1954 (paragraph 29), it was pointed outthat because so large a proportion of the regular recruits of the Army andR.A.F. entered on the new three and four-year engagements, there was considerable difficulty in building up and maintaining a &quot; hard core &quot; of menof long service and experience. It was essential, for this purpose, that a goodproportion of the short-term regular recruits should prolong their service.It was mainly to provide inducements for prolongations of service thatselective increases in service emoluments were introduced in April 1954(Cmd. 9088). The results of these pay increases cannot yet be finallyassessed. In the Navy, which is particularly concerned that as many menas possible should extend their medium term seven-year engagements, theresults, so far, are not encouraging. In the Army, while prolongations from men serving on the older (five-year and longer) engagements have shown a welcome increase it is still too early to assess the effects on men serving onthe three-year engagement. In the R.A.F. the results have been distinctlybetter, and there has been a definite improvement in the trades of highest skillas a direct result of the April 1954 pay increases. It remains, however, acardinal manpower problem to induce adequate numbers of men to prolongtheir current engagements.  If it is not solved, not only will it be necessaryIV. MANPOWERActive Forces62.

Recruitment and Strength.-The strength of the reserve and auxiliary forces, including part-time national service men, increased during 1954 from about 571,000 at 1st January, 1954, to about 647,000 on 1st January, 1955.The number of volunteers increased from 114,000 to 117,000.68. The total strength of the national service reserve increased from about457,000 at 1st January, 1954, to about 466,000 at 1st January, 1955. Itwill remain constant at about this latter figure for the further five years ending in 1959, for which Parliament has sanctioned the continuance of thecurrent national service scheme, since the numbers completing their period ofobligatory part-time service will be about balanced by new entries into thereserve on completion of colour service. The number of men who had undertaken a voluntary engagement in the reserve and auxiliary forces in lieu of part-time training liability increased from about 62,500 to about64,500 during 1954.69. Table 2 of Annex I compares the strength of the volunteer reserve and auxiliary forces at 1st January, 1954, and 1st January, 1955.Future of the National Service Scheme70. The Government have, naturally, considered whether any of the changes in defence policy which flow from the development of nuclear weapons affect the current scheme of National Service.to devote excessive resources to training, movements and administrativeoverheads inseparable from too high a proportion of short-service men but thegeneral level of skill and experience in the Services will inevitably suffer.65. National Service Requirements. On present estimates of regularrecruiting and prolongations of engagements, the Services will require in1955-56 to enter about 198,000 national service men, or men who undertakeregular engagements in lieu.   These are allocated as follows i Navy    ............... 7,500Army...............      130,500R.A.F................       60,00066. Total Size of Active Forces. During 1955-56 the total strength ofthe active forces is expected to decline by about 34,000 to about 788,000.In the following table, total strength at 1st April, 1954, is compared withestimated strengths at 1st April, 1955, and 1st April, 1956.

2V.-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT75. The provision for research and development in 1955-56 is about thesame as in 1954-55.76. As has already been stated, until there is international agreement on effective disarmament, our defence policy will continue to be basedprimarily upon the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent to aggression. Thisis reflected in the defence research and development programme.  The work71. Apart from building up trained reserves for an emergency, nationalservice makes an essential contribution to the efficiency of the active forces intwo main respects. First it provides the number of men necessary to ensurethat the Active Forces are able to carry out their commitments; secondly it provides skilled men and junior leaders, both officers and non-commissioned officers.72. Some redeployment of our Forces will take place following reductions in strength in Korea and the Middle East and the withdrawal of the Triestegarrison. But there will be a considerable reduction in regular strengthduring the course of 1955-56. And it will still be necessary for us to maintainstrong Forces in many parts of the world. The building up of an adequatestrategic reserve in the United Kingdom is an essential feature of our policy.Any appreciable reduction in the present period of two years&apos; colour service for national service men would mean that there would not be sufficient numbers of fully trained men to fulfil our commitments. Moreover the ratiobetween productive service and time under training would be reduced. Ingeneral, our Forces would be less effective and less efficient. The Govern-ment would therefore be failing in their duty were they to propose, at thepresent time, any reduction in the current period of whole-time NationalService.Colonial Forces73. At the present time the Malay Regiment, the Federation Regimentand a Battalion of the Fiji Regiment, in addition to the Royal MalayanNavy and the R.A.F. Regiment (Malaya), are actively engaged againstthe terrorists in Malaya. Six King&apos;s African Rifles Battalions are in Kenya,the seventh provides the garrison of Tanganyika and Mauritius, and two companies are in Uganda. The Kenya Regiment, the East Africa IndependentMotor Squadron, and the East African Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery are alsoserving in Kenya.74. The present strength of the armed forces raised by the colonial territories is about 63,000. This figure is expected to fall slightly to about43,000 by March 1956 as pioneer units hitherto employed in the middle east are disbanded. In addition, in certain Colonial territories local personnel are enlisted in the United Kingdom forces. These now number 14,000.The number of United Kingdom Officers and N.C.O.&apos;s providing die necessaryleadership and cadres for the organised units of the Colonial Forces is about,000.
carried out in previous years is coming to fruition in a steadily growingstock of nuclear weapons. Further work, however, is proceeding with theobject of increasing the variety and power of these weapons.77. The development and production of manned bombers the primarymeans of delivering nuclear weapons is proceeding satisfactorily. Theprogramme also contains other projects designed to ensure the maintenance and improvement of an effective deterrent to aggression.78. &apos; For the air defence of the United Kingdom, the development of bothhigh-performance manned fighters and guided missiles will continue. Thedevelopment of new fighter aircraft has been passing through a stage ofgreat difficulty. This has been due mainly to the rapidity of technicaladvances, and to decisions taken in the period 1945-50 and during the KoreanWar.79. The supply of aircraft to the Services is examined in detail in aseparate White Paper (Cmd, ).80. The main effort in the development of guided weapons is devotedto providing defence against bombers flying at high speeds and at great altitudes. Against this threat, heavy and medium A.A. guns will inthe future be of little value. The future air defence system of the UnitedKingdom will have as its main components the manned fighter and the ground-to-air guided weapon. The proportions between these weapons will varywith new developments, but it is clear that for a long time to come bothwill be needed to combat the bomber threat. The effectiveness of ourmanned fighters will be increased by fitting air-to-air guided weapons capableof engaging enemy aircraft at longer ranges and with a much greatercertainty of success than is possible with aircraft armed only with cannon.Development of these air-to-air guided weapons, incorporating a variety oftechniques, has reached an advanced stage.81. The surface-to-air guided weapons for use from the land and fromships which are under development are of relatively greater complexity thanair-to-air missiles, and the time required to develop an effective operationalweapon system is necessarily longer. Nevertheless good progress has beenmade and numerous trial firings are taking place both in this country and inAustralia.82. The Long Range Weapon Establishment and the Woomera range, setup in Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australian Guided WeaponProject are playing a rapidly increasing and essential part in the later stages of development and testing of both air-to-air and surface-to-air guided weapons.83. We have also to take account in the guided weapon research anddevelopment programme of the fact that the manned bomber may eventually be supplemented by the ballistic rocket. We are, therefore, working on thedevelopment of such a rocket as a deterrent and on methods of defence against attacks of this nature.84. There is close collaboration with the United States in the guidedweapon field. Comprehensive arrangements have been made for the exchangeof information and of visits by technical personnel. The nature of the potential
threat from the air to the two countries differs in many significant aspects. Asa result, the weapons required by each country must often have differentcharacteristics. Nevertheless, the arrangements for co-operation with theUnited States enable us to derive great advantage from the larger developmenteffort and the more extensive resources that the United States have been ableto devote to the new defence science, and at the same time to make a valuable contribution of our own.85. New possibilties for development of guided weapons are opening up with great rapidity. In planning the programme for the equipment of theServices, it is essential, therefore, to avoid the danger of devoting ournecessarily limited resources to the development and production of weaponsemploying techniques which will quickly become obsolete owing to the advent of new knowledge.86. It may be asked why we are not as advanced as our American allies.The simple answer is that we did not start until three years after them. the experimental establishments and the firms associated with the guided weapons programme have every reason to be proud of the work they havedone: it will stand up favourably to comparison, both in quality and in rateof progress, with any in the world.87. In framing the Naval Research and Development Programme both the offensive and defensive roles of the Fleets have been most closely studied.The improvement of weapons for use against fast and heavily armed cruisers,high speed submarines of great underwater endurance and long range aircraft has made great progress, and technical advances of the highest operationalimportance are at this moment being achieved. The development ofshipborne guided weapons systems is well under way. The success of recent developments in aircraft carriers and their equipment will make it possible touse at sea heavier and faster fighter and strike aircraft, the latter being capableof carrying atomic bombs.88. The Research and Development Programme as a whole has recentlybeen fully reviewed taking account of the existence of nuclear weapons.Though at first sight it might appear that the introduction of thesedevastating weapons would permit wholesale reductions in our activities inother directions, there are many situations in which the use of nuclear weaponswould be militarily unsound, and it is still necessary for us to maintain our effort in the development of other weapons. What is more, many of the projects on which we are expending a great deal of work at the present time are completely unproven, and it would not be proper in the interest of thedefence of the country to take unreasonable risks in all other directions.89. We are continuing to develop close collaboration over the whole field of defence research and development with the other countries of theCommonwealth as well as with the United States.90. The Statement on Defence 1954 pointed out that, because of theirextreme complexity and novelty, the time taken to put the newer types of weapons through all the various stages of research and development into production &quot; tends to be very much longer than in the past.&quot; It can be dangerous and misleading to ignore this fact.   It is a mistake to assume,
VI.-PRODUCTION91. Expenditure on production was a good deal less than the estimate in1953-54 and there will be certain underspendings in the current financialyear. It is now apparent that, in framing the estimates for both years, an inadequate allowance was made for the development difficulties associatedwith the newest equipment. Fcr this reason and also because the productionof some types of equipment can in present circumstances be reduced, thetotal amount to be provided for defence production in 1955-56 has been estimated at  610 million.92. There have in fact been no serious production as distinct fromdevelopment difficulties. The development difficulties in the aircraft fieldare explained in the separate White Paper on aircraft supply. In general thecurrent rate of development leads, if we are to keep pace, to relatively shortruns of production. This factor, added to technical complexities, makes theorganisation of production by no means easy. The problem is less one of mass production of relatively simple equipment, than of the &quot; tailor-made &quot;production of relatively small quantities of highly complicated equipment.93. The production programmes of the three Services in 1955-56 will be described in detail in the memoranda accompanying their respectiveEstimates.   The following are among their principal features.94. In the Navy the design of a new system of power-operated armamenthas been sufficientiy proved to make it possible to resume work on thethree &quot; Tiger &quot;-Class Cruisers which will have exceptionally high fire-power.The submarine new construction programme will continue; a high-speedexperimental submarine will, it is expected, be completed in 1955-56. Stepswill be taken to enable a start to be made with the construction of a new typeof ship designed to meet the conditions of the future. An experimentalGuided Weapon Ship, converted from a Maintenance Ship, is nearing completion and her trials, planned to begin in 1956, will have an important bearing on future designs. Increased effort will be devoted to refitting ships of both the active and reserve fleets to improve their efficiency and readiness.Economies in the provision of naval aircraft will flow from the reducedaccident rate expected with the introduction into our carriers of the angleddeck and the mirror landing device.95. The long-term plan for the re-equipment of the Army will continue.During the year the first of a new range of wireless sets will be issued; newL.A.A. guns, new radar for the field forces and new sub-machine guns willalso reach the troops. Large-scale trials of the F.N. rifle will be carried outboth at home and overseas.96. The re-equipment of the Royal Air Force with more modern andadvanced types of aircraft and equipment will be accelerated in 1955-56.Further comment is contained in the separate White Paper referred to inbecause it is announced that nuclear weapons, guided missiles, supersonicaircraft, and so on are under development, that they are practically ready foruse in operations, and this applies equally to the United Kingdom and allother countries.
paragraph 79. The first stage of the expansion and modernisation of the radarnetwork in overseas theatres will be completed and a start will be made on thenext stage of the programme both for the United Kingdom and theContinent.97. Offshore Procurement. Contracts to the value of about $200 million were placed in the United Kingdom in 1954 under the off-shore procure-ment programme for the purchase by the United States of military equipment for N.A.T.O. countries, bringing the total value of such contractsup to $650 million. These covered the production of aircraft (Hunters,Javelins and Sea Hawks), ammunition. Centurion tanks and electronicequipment.98. Military Aid from the United States and Canada. We have continuedto receive equipment under the United States Mutual Security Act, somebeing produced in this country under the off-shore procurement programme.The United States has also assisted in expanding our capacity for themanufacture of propellants and explosives by providing the plant underoff-shore contracts while we bear the cost of the buildings.99. The Canadian mutual aid programme has continued. Among the items received by the United Kingdom are anti-aircraft radar, ammunition,propellants and explosives.VII. CO-OPERATION WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH AND with international ORGANISATIONSCommonwealth100. Close co-operation and day-to-day consultations on defence mattersbetween the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countriescontinue at all levels.101. It was announced last autumn that, consequent on the reduction ofthe American forces in Korea, it had been agreed that the Commonwealthland forces in Korea should be reduced by two-thirds. This reduction is nearly completed. The forces remaining will continue as a separateCommonwealth formation. In the Middle East and the Far East units fromother Commonwealth countries have continued to serve alongside UnitedKingdom forces,&apos;    &apos;; \&apos; . &apos;North Atlantic Treaty Organisation102. At their meeting in Paris in December, 1954, the N.A.T.O. Council,in addition to considering the report on the most effective pattern ofN.A.T.O. military strength referred to in paragraph 23, also considered theAnnual Review for 1954. They noted that there had been an increase inthe strength of N.A.T.O. forces and further steady improvements in their efficiency over the past year. This improvement in quality resulted fromincreases in operational and support units, from the supply of large quantitiesof new equipment and from large-scale combined exercises.103. The Agreements signed in Paris in October, 1954 (Cmd. 9304)provide for a number of organisational changes which will strengthen thecohesion and unity of N.A.T.O. forces on the Continent.
VIII. HOME DEFENCE106. Home defence measures, by demonstrating the country&apos;s determina-tion to resist aggression in all its forms, buttress the resolution needed to sustain an effective deterrent policy. Against the thermo-nuclear attack ofthe future the best defence of the civil population in this small, crowded andvulnerable island is to try and ensure that it never materialises. But we must also in common prudence continue to provide financial and other resources for some measure of insurance in case we should fail in our main aim ofaverting war. The extent of these precautions and the speed at which theyshould be put in hand will vary from time to time with changes in the inter-national situation and with the progress of our defence effort.107. An outline has been given in paragraph 5 of the effect which the useof thermo-nuclear bombs would have. The very grimness of this prospect isa potent influence in restraint of War, yet if war should come despite our efforts to prevent it, there is still much that can and must be done to mitigate theeffects of a thermo-nuclear attack.108. The new form of this threat to our security calls for a completeoverhaul of our home defence plans. These must be conceived not interms of our experience in the last war nor even of the threat posed by the atomic bomb. The advent of the hydrogen bomb calls for an entirely new approach. But the Government have not yet fully assessed the implications of the latest weapon developments. This applies particularly to the extensiveradio-active contamination which may be caused by the fall-out from ahydrogen bomb burst at ground level. Until an appreciation has beencompleted, it would be unwise to embark upon measures which may laterprove to be misdirected. The present superiority of the Western Alliance innuclear weapons is a powerful deterrent to war and affords justification for avoiding hasty decisions.104. The Paris Agreements also revise and extend the Brussels Treatyof 1948 and provide for the accession of Germany and Italy to the western european Union. On the political side they mark a further movement towards the unity of Europe. On the military side this organisation willcontrol the level of armaments and the size of the forces of member countries on the Continent and will thus provide the instrument for a controlledrearmament of Germany.South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty105. In September 1954 a collective defence treaty for the South-east asia Area was signed by the Governments of Australia, France, New Zealand,Pakistan, the Philippines, Siam, the United Kingdom and the United States.The Foreign Ministers of these Governments are to meet shortly in Bangkokto consider arrangements for the fulfilment of the provisions of the treaty and to exchange views on matters affecting the peace and security of thetreaty area.
Civil Defence Services109. We cannot, nor ever will be able to, forecast the precise effect or theextent of any nuclear attack against this country. Some areas would be destroyed, some would be on the fringe of devastation, others would escapedirect damage by blast and heat. Still less can we forecast the pattern of radio-active contamination which might result from the attack. It would be quite wrong for people to assume that their neighbourhood would be sure toreceive a direct hit and that they would therefore be unable to help themselvesor others. It would be equally mistaken to assume that any part of thecountry would escape the effects of the attack and have no need of help.110. The need for rescue, fire-figiiing and welfare operations would be as great as ever. The presence of radio-activity would have to be detected andmeasured, and the necessary warning given to the public. The first call wouldhave to be met by the civilian services on the spot organised by the localauthorities, with the help of the Civil Defence Corps, and the Industrial civil defence Service, the Auxiliary Fire Service and the Women&apos;s voluntary services, and by the National Hospital Services (including the NationalHospital Service Reserve) supported by the voluntary aid societies. Everyindividual citizen would be needed; common sense and good neighbourlinessdemand that everyone should be ready to take part.The Role of the Armed Forces111. But the local services, though vital, would not in themselves besufficient. They would need to be supported by all the formed and disciplinedbodies of the armed forces that were available in this island. TheGovernment have therefore decided that all members of the armed forces,including the Home Guard, will in future receive training in elementary civil defence duties as part of their normal military training. This will enablethem to play an effective part in assisting the local civil defence services, inaddition to carrying out their active operational role.The Mobile Defence Corps112. For this purpose an effective link is needed between the local civil defence forces and the organised bodies of the armed forces. This must bea disciplined body under direct military control, consisting of service personnel and capable or rapid deployment in support of the local civil defence services wherever the need is greatest.113. To provide this vital link the Government have decided to establish a Mobile Defence Corps specially trained in, and equipped for, fire-fighting and rescue and ambulance duties. The scope of these duties may be enlargedin time in the light of experience. Initially the aim will be to build up duringthe next three or four years a force of 48 reserve battalions, each of aminimum strength of about 600. Some of these will be trained and equipped to perform fire-fighting duties, others to perform rescue and ambulanceduties. In an emergency these battalions, which will be distributed over thewhole country, would be mobilised like any other unit of the reserve forces.114. Men will be selected for the new Corps from the Army andR.A.F. and will receive one month&apos;s whole-time training during the course
of their active service. Special training depots will be opened in various parts of Great Britain and the intention is that about 10,000 men a year will receive whole-time training at these depots. Sufficient accommodationwill be available to receive the first intake of whole-time trainees towardsthe end of this year. On completion of their active service these men willbe posted to a reserve battalion as near as possible to their homes. Theywill carry out their 15 days&apos; annual reserve training with their battalionsat the training depots.115. As the new scheme develops the Government will consider the praticability of expanding the number of reserve battalions.116. General responsibility for the new Corps will rest with the WarOffice but a certain proportion of the training depots and of the reservebattalions will be manned by the R.A.F. In the event of mobilisation thereserve battalions would come under the operational control of the localArmy Commander who would deploy them in consultation with the civil defence regional authorities.117. The permanent instructional and administrative staffs required atthe training depots will be found from within the active Army and R.A.F. andby the employment where appropriate of civilians. The more senior officersand N.C.O.S. of the reserve battalions will have to be found from volunteers and the Government are confident that adequate numbers with the necessaryService experience will see in this new development an opportunity forserving their country in a vital and exacting role.Scheme for Training R.A.F. Class H Reservists in Civil Defence Duties[118. No new legislation will be necessary to enable members of the armed forces to receive civil defence training. The Civil Defence (armed forces) Act, 1954, provides for National Service reservists to be given part-time training in civil defence duties during their period of reserve trainingliability. As has already been announced, it was proposed to begin during1955 training in these duties certain R.A.F. Class H reservists who would notbe required for service with the R.A.F. on mobilisation. The arrangements fortraining Class H reservists will be continued, though some modifications willbe necessary to adapt them to the new scheme. Priority will be given to thenew Mobile Defence Corps which will provide trained units as againstindividuals with certain basic training. Class H reservists will, however,be trained and used to the greatest extent possible within the scope of thenew plan.]Evacuation and Shelter119. Besides reviewing the role of the armed forces in home defence theGovernment are also re-examining all civil defence policies, notably those on evacuation and shelter. These must now take account not only of blastand heat but also of radio-active fall-out. The distinction between evacuation,neutral and reception areas will be far less easy to make than in the past,since the effects of fall-out would be felt over wide areas of the country-side and the relative safety of rural areas would be correspondingly reduced.
/ JobNevertheless some areas, primarily those with the greatest concentration of population and industry, would still be more vulnerable than others.There would therefore be some advantage in spreading the risk by a measureof dispersal into rural areas and the less vulnerable towns so long as thisenabled the community to continue to function effectively.120. Within a few miles of the point of burst it would be quite impracticable to provide protection against the violent explosive power ofa hydrogen bomb. But beyond the area of devastation by blast and heat aconsiderable degree of protection against the effects of fall-out, during theperiod of intense radiation, could be secured by shelter which need not beof very elaborate construction, for example by a trench with overhead earthcover. This would have to be allied with disciplined behaviour on thepart of the population and with the observance of cleansing precautionsafter the attack.121. Study of the implications of fall-out must, however, be carried further before the Government can determine the right policies both forshelter and evacuation.Casualties and Homeless122. A single hydrogen bomb explosion on a built-up area would takevery heavy toll of life and leave very large numbers of people injured andhomeless. To the increased casualties resulting directly from the greaterdestructive effects of the hydrogen bomb there would have to be added thelarge numbers of people affected or suspected of being affected by radio-activity. Planning of the casualty services must, therefore, take accountof this tremendously increased burden.123. The need to care for those who have had to leave their homes,whether in the course of evacuation or through the destruction or contamination-tion of their houses, would present a formidable problem in providing billetsand rest centres. Full use would have to be made of every type of building in the areas to which the homeless were moved and emergency feedingarrangements would have to be provided. Plans prepared in advance todeal with such a situation would have to be supplemented on the widest possible scale by improvisation and by the readiness on the part of localauthorities and the public generally to do whatever they could to helpthemselves and each other.Communications124. The maintenance of communications would be vital, not only tomeet the operational needs of the fighting services and of civil defence&apos;, but alsoto make possible the organisation of supplies and movement and todisseminate essential information. The Post Office are therefore planning tobuild up a special network, both by cable and by radio, designed to maintainlong-distance communication in the event of attack.Ports125. A large part of the imports into this country enters through the majorports which are vulnerable to thermo-nuclear attack.   Plans have therefore
been drawn up for the provision of alternative facilities, including the useof smaller ports and harbours. Much practical work has been done to implement them. These arrangements cover dry cargo and oil and take account of the internal distribution of cargoes once landed.Stockpiling126. After the initial attack there would be a period during which theimport and distribution of normal supplies of food and materials would bevery seriously disrupted. It would be necessary to have available stocks of essential commodities, widely distributed so that they might so far as possibleescape destruction or contamination. Those which would be chiefly neededwould be food, in the most convenient form for storage and emergencyfeeding purposes, and oil, which would be required in large quantities for emergency transport and also for other purposes such as heating and cooking. Progress will be made in the coming year in building up reserves of such essential supplies.Finance127. In the financial year 1955-56, which will be an interim year whilepolicy is being reshaped,  65 million has been provided for defence expenditure by Civil Departments (including loan expenditure by the PostOffice). In addition there will be the cost of the Mobile Defence Corps.The Government will keep under review the balance between expenditure onthe active forces and on home defence. It is, of course, the former which provides for the main deterrent to war and so for the basic security of thecivil population. An analysis of defence expenditure by Civil Departments,is given in Annex III.Conclusion128. The Government do not claim that they have yet found solutionsto all the many and varied problems, some of which have been outlined inthis paper, posed for home defence by the advent of thermo-nuclear weapons.What is said here will be amplified by further statements as the Governmentsstudies and planning proceed. They believe, however, that the country is entitled to know the gravity of the possible threat and to be given an indication of the lines on which the Government are working to meet it. Theyare confident that the people as a.whole will be ready and willing to play their part in building that will to resist which is an essential part of the deterrent to aggression.
