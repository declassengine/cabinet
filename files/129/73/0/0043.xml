Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955SECRET Copy No.   g gC. (55) 4316th February, 1955 .......CABINETCOMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsMr. Lennox-Boyd and I had a talk to-day with Mr. Menzies and Mr. Hollandabout future Commonwealth membership. They had both studied the attached paper on &quot; The Future of Commonwealth Membership &quot; which I had given to themand to the Canadian Prime Minister.2. Mr. Menzies and Mr. Holland agreed that the policy set out in the paper was the only practicable course we could pursue. Neither of them like theprospect of the progressive enlargement of Prime Ministers&apos; meetings any morethan we do. Mr. Menzies said that already the number of second reading speechesmade at these meetings was reducing their value and affecting the old intimateassociation when there were only four Commonwealth countries. They agreedthat the best way of dealing with this was to carry on the separate treatment alreadypractised between the United Kingdom Government and &quot; the old four.&quot; Thisworked all right in the pooling of information and ideas and consultation on policy;but it was more difficult when it came to meetings. They agreed that the separatemeetings we had had on defence at this Conference, and which had become are recognised practice which all the Commonwealth Governments accepted was a useful precedent. But these had been confined to defence. I.said.that, thoughone might have a restricted meeting for a particular purpose and this would be thepublic justification, we could quite well talk about a lot of other things at the sametime.   \3. Mr. Holland asked what would be the procedure if one commonwealth government objected to the admission of a new country while all the others agreed.I said that fortunately we had no written constitution and nothing had been laiddown. If the issue became acute I presumed the dissenting Government wouldhaveTomake up its mind whether to concur with all the other Governments or togo out. One of the advantages of the decision having to be taken by all the fullmembers was that this would be an issue not between the United KingdomGovernment and a Commonwealth Government but an issue for all of us; andthe influence which Prime Ministers like themselves could bring to bear would bevery important.4. This led on to the question of what South Africa was likely to do if theGold Coast applied for full membership. Mr. Menzies, who had visited SouthAfrica after the Coronation, had formed the same opinion that I expressed to theCabinet, namely, that South Africa would say some pretty rude things, but would accept the view of all the other full members rather than go out of the Common-wealth. Mr. Menzies said he thought that South Africa was anxious not to bealone, and that view had been strengthened by the attitude Mr. Swart adopted inside and outside the Conference.5. Mr. Lennox-Boyd informed us that the Gold Coast issue might be post-poned for a further year as the Gold Coast Prime Minister had run into difficulties with the Ashanti Confederation; but this could not be guaranteed.
^3 &quot;2.Commonwealth Relations OfficeDowning Street, S.W. 1,11th February, 1955.6. We then discussed the position of the Central African Federation. explained that our view here was that it would be impossible to admit the gold coast and do nothing for the Federation. The constitution of the Federationcould not be changed until it came up for review under the terms of the Constitutionitself. But the difference between the Federation and a Colony was that, whereas the Colonial Government started by having jurisdiction over some local internalmatters and advanced progressively until it obtained control of all its affairs,internal and external, the Federation started by controlling the major problemsof the Territories and defence and, to a large extent, foreign affairs, while theTerritorial Governments retained control of a number of territorial matters. we thought it would therefore be possible, when the time came, to propose that thePrime Minister of the Federation should attend Prime Ministers&apos; meetings as of right. This might not be logical, but fortunately we had no written CommonwealthConstitution and we could adopt practical solutions. In the past the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia had attended Commonwealth Meetings by invitation; andit had been a natural evolution, when the Federation came into being, that thePrime Minister of the Federation should be invited instead of the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia.7. Mr. St. Laurent told me that he had shown the attached paper toMr. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs; and Mr. Pearsontold me that he agreed with his Prime Minister that we were on the right lines.SWINTON.
THE FUTURE OF COMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPIWithin the next few years the Gold Coast will claim the right to assumefull responsibility for her own affairs. She will probably wish to acquire thestatus of &quot; independence within the Commonwealth &quot; and will expect this tocarry with it acceptance as a full member of the Commonwealth. She can onlybe admitted to full membership by a collective decision of the existing members.If she is not so admitted, she will ask what her new constitutional status will be.The answer given to that question will have an important influence on the futurepattern of the Commonwealth connection. It ought therefore to be given, notsolely with reference to the Gold Coast, but in the knowledge that it will establish a precedent applicable to other dependent territories which in future attain thestatus of independent nationhood.Before we reach this important turning-point in the evolution of theCommonwealth connection we should look ahead and consider in what general direction these constitutional developments should be guided. For this purposewe must try to forecast what the shape of the Commonwealth is likely to be inten or twenty years&apos; time, and what will then be the essential links between  itsindependent members.2. For many years successive Governments in the United Kingdom havepursued, with a broad measure of public support, a Colonial policy of assistingdependent peoples to reach a stage of development at which they can assume responsibility for managing their own affairs. As a result, constitutional development is proceeding steadily in many parts of the Colonial Empire. this process cannot now be halted or reversed, and it is only to a limited extent thatits pace can be controlled by the United Kingdom Government. Sometimes itmay be possible to secure acceptance of a reasonable and beneficial delay in orderto ensure a more orderly transition. But, in the main, the pace of constitutional change will be determined by the strength of nationalist feeling and the developmentof political consciousness within the territory concerned. Political leaders whohave obtained assurances of independence for their people normally expect thatthe promised independence will be attained within their own political lifetime;and, if they cannot satisfy their followers that satisfactory progress is being maintained towards that goal, their influence may be usurped by less responsibleelements. Any attempt to retard by artificial delays the progress of Colonialpeoples towards independence would produce disastrous results. It would, inparticular, be likely to have the consequence that, when power had eventually tobe transferred, it would be handed over to a local leadership predisposed towards an anti-British policy.3. The territories in the Colonial Empire may for this purpose be classifiedin three groups:  (a) If constitutional development pursues its natural course, it seems likely that within the next ten or twenty years the following territories(arranged in alphabetical order) will achieve a fully independent status and become candidates for full Commonwealth membership:  * Central African Federation.Gold Coast.Malayan Federation (including the present Federation of Malaya,Singapore and possibly North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei).Nigerian Federation.West Indian Federation.* In the preamble to the Constitution of the Central African Federation it is declared that theassociation of the three territories in a Federation would enable it, when its inhabitants so desired,to go forward towards the attainment of full membership of the Commonwealth. It is also providedthat the Constitution itself shall be reviewed between I960 and 1962. The Federation may wellacquire before then so much of the practical substance of full Commonwealth membership as canbe secured within the existing Constitution.
United Kingdom        ...      ............ 59-2Canada  ...      ...      ............ 14.4Australia         ...      ...      ......... g. 5New Zealand    ...............       &apos; 2-south Africa    ............... 12- 6aJndia      ...      .................. 356-9Pakistan..................... 75.3Ceylon   ......      ......      ......... g. central African Federation   ............ 6-2bGold Coast (including Ashanti and N. Territories) ... 4-4Malayan Federation    ...      ........... 7. \cNigerian Federation    .............     ... 31-0West Indies Federation        ............ 2-1 d(a) Europeans: 2 - 6 millions.(b) Europeans: 213,000.(c) Including Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei.(d) Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados and Leeward and Windward Islands.II5. What purposes will be served if all the countries in this group are heldtogether in the political association of the Commonwealth? What advantagesshall we gain?(i) We shall support and strengthen the political influence of the Common-wealth as a whole throughout the world.We cannot hope to maintain that influence unless we succeed in holding together in a new form of association those parts of our formerEmpire which achieve independence. To follow courses whichencouraged those countries to secede from, the Commonwealth on(b) There are many small territories which, though they may be or becomecapable of managing their own internal affairs, are never likely to achieve full independence, and cannot aspire to the status of full commonwealth membership. These are listed in the Appendix.Most of these territories present no immediate problem. For manyof them direct or indirect rule on the Colonial pattern will continueto be appropriate for many years to come. From none of them couldthere be any legitimate claim to full political equality with theindependent members of the Commonwealth.(c) There remains an intermediate group where the future course of political development is uncertain:  Kenya.Tanganyika.Uganda.Sierra Leone.Of these, Sierra Leone may in due course develop on the same lines as the Gold Coast. So might Uganda. In the other East african territories, however, the problem is different. There the first need isto find some means of reconciling the interests of the white settlers, the asian community and the indigenous African population. If this problem can be solved, it may be possible to overcome the localobjections, now strongly held, to the creation of an East african federation which would in due course become a candidate for full commonwealth membership.4. The urgent problem arises from the rapid growth of nationalism and the consequent pace of political development in the five territories listed in group (a).It is this which will test the flexibility of the Commonwealth connection and will present an immediate challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship.All the territories in this group are likely to attain full independence withinthe next ten or twenty years. If they are then retained within the Commonwealth,the independent countries of the Commonwealth will be:  Present Population(Millions)
attaining their independence would be tantamount to adopting a policyof deliberately weakening our own strength and authority in worldcouncils by a series of self-inflicted wounds. The prestige and inter-national standing of the Commonwealth has in fact been enhancedin recent years by its capacity to hold within it countries to which full political independence has been accorded.(ii) We shall strengthen the sterling area by maintaining its political cohesion.(iii) We shall strengthen our defence potential.Some of the younger Commonwealth members may become morewilling to support a common military effort as the years go by. Mean-while the maintenance of the political connection between them as independent countries of the Commonwealth will provide valuablefacilities, in communications, raw materials and industrial potential,to support such Commonwealth forces as may be engaged in a future war.(iv) Countries which maintain the Commonwealth connection are less likely,in the period of their political immaturity, to pass under the influence of hostile Powers. Even though the grant of independence is delayed until internal political problems have been overcome, there is still a risk that some of the territories now nearing the stage of independence(e.g., a Malayan Federation) might, if they chose independence outsidethe Commonwealth, fall under the influence of a hostile Power whether by way of internal penetration or by open aggression. this risk will be reduced if they remain within the political association ofthe Commonwealth.iv). The Commonwealth is as yet the only effective international organisation which links together in an intimate association both white and coloured peoples. As such it now provides a valuable bridgebetween the West and Asia, and in the coming generation it could dothe same with Africa. To play this role, the Commonwealth mustretain its multi-racial character with formal constitutional equalitybetween member nations of different races.(vi) From a broader point of view we may have faith that countries whichhave inherited, whether by blood or by upbringing, the British traditionsand outlook on life will be more likely to work for peace and toexercise a healthy influence in international affairs. They will be ableto do so more effectively if they are linked together in a single politicalassociation.6. The independent Commonwealth peoples associated in this group arefavourably placed to exercise a substantial influence in world affairs.The group. includes at least one country of outstanding importance and influence in each continent of the world Europe, (North) America, Africa, asia and the South Pacific.It embraces people of all the most important races save the Slavs andMongols Europeans, Asians and Africans are included in it.It includes people of all the main religions of the world Christian, Moslem,Hindu and Buddhist.7. What is the essential link between them? What is the common feature of the group?The tie of blood, though important, is not the governing factor.   It neverwas.Nor are we now all bound together by a common allegiance to the Crown-All the independent members of the Commonwealth recognise the Queen as Headof the Commonwealth and as the symbol of the free association of its peoples.But the Commonwealth of the future will probably include more than one republicwhose people owe no personal allegiance to the Sovereign. However greatly wemay regret this, it need not be fatal to the cohesion of the Commonwealth. Oneof the most obvious deductions from the common allegiance was the presumption that, if one Commonwealth country were forced into war, all the other membersof the Commonwealth would be at her side. But it has long been recognisedthat the decision to participate in a war rested with each commonwealth government separately.
Ill8. Many feared that the admission of three Asiatic countries to commonwealth membership would impair the intimate relations which had previously been maintained between the independent members of the Common-wealth. And, although the older members have not allowed this widening of theCommonwealth circle to disturb their old relations with one another, they havenot as yet found it easy to treat the new Asiatic members on precisely the same footing. Thus, for various reasons, it has been found necessary to draw a distinction e.g., in the types of information communicated between Common-wealth Governments-between the new and the old members of theCommonwealth.Fears may now be entertained that the Commonwealth relationship may befurther diluted if the Gold Coast and other countries in a comparable stage ofdevelopment achieve full membership. For this reason it has been suggested thatthe time has come to develop a two-tier system of Commonwealth membership.Under this system membership of the inner circle, or upper tier, would be restricted to those countries which are in full control of their external relations and are capable of making a significant contribution towards their own defence. the qualification would have to be so framed as to confine the inner membership to countries whose views would command respect in world councils. Thus, the testin respect of external relations would not be satisfied by a constitutional right to conduct external relations or even perhaps by the fact that a country had enteredinto diplomatic relations with neighbouring States or with a few of the great powers. A candidate for the upper tier would be required to show that it waseffectively conducting its own foreign policy. As regards defence, it would notbe possible to make it a condition of inner membership that a country should be capable of defending itself, unaided, against external aggression. In the worldof to-day this ambition is outside the reach of almost everybody. Most countriesmust rely, for their protection, on membership of some defensive alliance. the test would be whether the country had sufficient military strength to make it a worthwhile member of such an alliance.9. This conception of a second class of Commonwealth membership hasattractions at first sight. But on closer examination it proves to be open to serious objections. And it seems doubtful whether it would be practicable to bring it into operation.  Thus: -(i) The tests suggested for membership of the upper tier are not absolute;they are essentially matters for judgment.   The judgment on a sparticular application would have to be made by the existing membersof the upper tier. Would they, find it easy to reach a decision acceptable to all?   And would the applicant be content to accept an adversedecision?&quot;^.&apos;.&apos;:. ;(ii) Not all of the countries now represented at meetings of commonwealth prime Ministers would qualify for membership of the inner circle onthe basis suggested.  It is arguable that Ceylon might fail to pass theThe cohesion of the Commonwealth will continue to be strengthened by thefact that many of its members owe allegiance to a single Sovereign and that allrecognise that Sovereign as the symbol of their free association. But the onefeature which will continue to be common to all Commonwealth members is that,by reason of their history, they have common traditions, methods of Governmentand political institutions. They have also inherited or acquired the use of theEnglish language as a medium (in most places the medium) of administration andcivilised intercourse. Their common past makes it likely that there will be abroad similarity in their attitude to most major international problems. This is theimportant quality which all the independent members of the Commonwealth have in common. In some peoples who have recently achieved independence it maybe obscured for a time by the passing distempers which accompany emancipationfrom external rule; but, when the initial exuberance of freedom has subsided, itwill emerge. To preserve, strengthen and develop it should be a prime objectof Commonwealth policy. And the forms of the Commonwealth connection,and the procedures for maintaining it, should be so moulded and fashioned as tosecure that object.
tests. The Central African Federation would certainly fail to qualify.But its leading member, Southern Rhodesia, has for some time pastenjoyed de facto most of the benefits of full membership, includingattendance at most meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers; andSir Godfrey Huggins has been invited, as Prime Minister of the newFederation, to the present Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting on the same footing as on previous occasions as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia.Would it be practicable to ask the Central African Federation-still less Ceylon to withdraw from the inner circle and accept a positionin the second tier?(iii) Some at any rate of the new candidates for Commonwealth membership would be reluctant to accept the inferior status of second-tier member-ship especially if the Central African Federation remained in the uppertier. Gold Coast Ministers have shown that they understand the distinction between the grant of self-government and the attainment of Commonwealth membership. But that does not lessen the risk that the Gold Coast, on attaining full self-government, would rejectany suggestion that it should remain within the Commonwealth withany constitutional status inferior to that of the older members.(iv) At the outset the lower tier would consist wholly of countries withcoloured populations (unless the Central African Federation, with itsEuropean element, were constrained to join it). Even though Indiaand Pakistan remained in the upper tier, it would be difficult to avoid creating the impression that the second tier had been invented in orderto prevent any further countries with coloured populations from entering the inner circle. It would be impossible to maintain thetwo-tier system if it could be represented as based on a colourdistinction.(v) Even if the newcomers could be induced to accept a lower-tier status, theywould probably be discontented with it and there is a risk that theirdiscontent would be exploited by other countries.(vi) Unless we can retain the friendship and partnership of those colonial territories which are approaching self-government, it is likely that,instead of being at best co-operative or at least aquiescent, they may become positively hostile and, on the worst prospect, fall into theSoviet camp. However uncomfortable it may seem to some to havethem as full members of the Commonwealth, it would be far more damaging to our wider interests if they were to turn against us. Oneof the great difficulties in the two-tier suggestion is that aspirants to commonwealth membership are likely to regard it as failing to meet their legitimate demands, and will therefore be disposed to secede fromthe Commonwealth rather than accept an inferior status within it. Ifthe break were to occur with acrimony, the consequences might be veryserious.(vii) Should any of these countries succeed in becoming members of the united nations (as they almost certainly would if Russia changed her present attitude), they would hardly be content with an inferior status withinthe Commonwealth when, at the same time, they would sit in theGeneral Assembly on equal terms, not only with other commonwealth countries who are members of the United Nations, but with the UnitedStates, Russia and other great Powers.10. Apart from these practical difficulties, the two-tier system will defeat theessential purpose of the Commonwealth connection if, as stated in paragraph above, that purpose is to develop a community of outlook among all commonwealth members on the main international problems of the day.The countries which will shortly assume full responsibility for their own affairs will in fact wish to conduct from the outset some of their external relations.Thus, the Gold Coast will undoubtedly wish to develop diplomatic relations withthe United States and probably with the other European countries havingColonial possessions in Africa. A Malayan Federation would certainly wish tomaintain diplomatic relations with Indonesia and, in less troubled times, with china. A West Indian Federation would probably wish to establish relations withthe United States.
12. One of the objections sometimes raised to any further extension of full commonwealth membership is that what was formerly a close partnership between a few influential countries will be impaired if membership is opened to a largenumber of small countries. The fear is that the Commonwealth countries whichcarry weight in the world might fail to make their views prevail at a meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers if they were outnumbered by countries newlyadmitted to independence and still insignificant internationally.This apprehension, if it is seriously entertained, may be allayed by knowledge that, of the countries which may soon claim full membership, so many are likelyto come forward in groups, viz., the Central African Federation, the MalayanFederation and the West Indian Federation. It will be seen from the populationfigures in paragraph 4 above that the newcomers at such a gathering will not infact be representing small territories or insignificant interests.: A more compelling consideration is, however, that on these occasionsdecisions do not go by vote. Nor^ for that matter, does influence depend on cardvotes. At these meetings leadership and influence will doubtless continue to beexercised by those who can command it, on their individual merits or by virtueof the actual or potential power of the countries which they represent.13. At &quot; plenary &quot; meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers all membersof the Commonwealth Would need to be represented. But this need not make itimpossible to hold from time to time smaller meetings at which something lessAs soon as any of these countries begin to conduct any external relations,they will feel the need of friendly help and advice. It is important that they shouldbe encouraged to look for this to the other members of the Commonwealth. the concept outlined in paragraph 7 above will be wholly destroyed unless they do.The last thing we would wish is that any of these countries should be drawn into some foreign sphere of influence. It would, for example, be highly embarrassingif any of them, on gaining admission to the United Nations, were drawn into a south American bloc or an Arab bloc likely to vote against the other members ofthe Commonwealth. This situation would be only too likely to arise if, throughbeing relegated to a second tier of Commonwealth membership, they were excluded^-and felt themselves to be excluded from the intimate interchange of views and information on foreign policy which characterises the relations between theexisting members of the Commonwealth.11. In practice, the only means of ensuring that these countries, on attainingindependence, will turn to us for help and advice in the conduct of their external relations is to make available to them from the outset information and guidance on such international questions as are of direct concern to them. Their first steps in the conduct of external relations will be of crucial importance. It will thereforebe most desirable that they should from the outset exchange representatives withother Commonwealth countries and that through this medium they should beprovided with a flow of information and guidance, selective at first butprogressively enlarged, on international matters of direct concern to them andof common concern to the Commonwealth as a whole. And, as time goes on,there will be need for personal exchanges between the Foreign Ministers of thosecountries and of the older members of the Commonwealth. It is only by thismeans that we can hope to develop, in new Commonwealth members, thatsimilarity of approach to the main problems of international relations which enables the Commonwealth to exercise its influence in world affairs. But theseprocedures, viz., the exchange of High Commissioners, the interchange ofinformation and views on foreign policy, and attendance at periodical meetingsof Commonwealth Ministers, are in fact the outward marks of full commonwealth membership.All this suggests that the essential purpose of the Commonwealth connectionwill not be achieved unless countries attaining full independence within it are admitted to full membership of it. This need not mean that certain aspects oftheir relations with the United Kingdom or other Commonwealth members couldnot be defined and regulated by written agreements importing specified duties and obligations. There would certainly be scope for such agreements on defence,finance and other matters: agreements of this kind were in fact concluded withCeylon.\ &apos;    IV
than the whole body of Commonwealth members would be represented. Meetingsto deal with specific regional problems could probably be arranged. And smallermeetings could sometimes be held on a functional basis, e.g., some defencediscussions could be limited to countries which had accepted specific defence commitments.It might even be possible to develop a system by which formal meetings, onthe model of the old Imperial Conferences, were held for the discussion of financialand economic questions and other technical matters the Colonies, as well as independent Commonwealth countries, being represented on such occasions butthe smaller meetings of Prime Ministers were treated as more informal gatheringsto be held at irregular intervals, as occasion offered. This might make it possiblefor the Prime Ministers of some of the older Commonwealth countries to meet together from time to time, even though not all of the new member countries were represented.It must, however, be admitted that in arranging meetings confined mainly tothe Prime Ministers of the old Commonwealth countries great care would have tobe taken to avoid importing the suggestion that a concealed two-tier system wasin operation. It is also true that such smaller meetings, whether convened on a regional or on a functional basis, would rarely consist of those Prime Ministers andno other. Thus, in recent consultations between Commonwealth representatives in New York to deal with United Nations business, it has usually been found desirable to include India.14. The admission of further countries to Commonwealth membership may also lead to some changes in the procedures for day-to-day exchanges between commonwealth Governments. The free and full exchange of information andviews which takes place between certain Commonwealth countries will be neithernecessary nor appropriate in the case of an African territory which has newlyattained its independence. It will be reasonable that there should be somediscrimination, between Commonwealth Governments, in the exchange ofinformation on international questions of current interest. This, however, will not involve any radical departure from existing practice. In the day-to-day exchanges, asin matters of constitutional status, there would be dangers in discriminating byclass and developing hard-and-fast differentiations in treatment between &quot; old &quot;members and &quot; new &quot;-or, for that matter, between &quot;old,&quot; Asian and african members.V15. Africa&apos;s future presents a challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship.The application of the Gold Coast for full Commonwealth membership will,when it comes, mark a decisive turning-point in the evolution of theCommonwealth connection. It will be recognised as such by other countries,and especially by the Asian members of the Commonwealth. The solutionsuggested in this paper will certainly produce difficulties. In South Africa there isalready criticism of the United Kingdom for bringing African colonies to independence at too fast a pace, or indeed bringing them to independence at all.Mr. Strydom (who, like all other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, would have tobe consulted before a collective decision was taken on the admission of a new member) may therefore find it difficult to agree to the Gold Coasfs admission to commonwealth membership. On the other hand, a decision to refuse heradmission would certainly produce a wide rift between the old members of theCommonwealth and the Asian members. A decision based, or thought to bebased, on a denial of racial equality might well lead to a disruption of theCommonwealth as we know it to-day. If it did not lead to the secession of the asian countries from the Commonwealth it might provoke them into assuming an open leadership of all the aspiring African Colonies which might be even moredisruptive in its effects on the cohesion of the Commonwealth and Empire.January 1955.
