Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955&apos;CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 73C. (55) 41 uv ^ - &apos;^15th February, 1955CABINETASSOCIATION OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WITH THENORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION...,.(       Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I circulate for the information of my colleagues the text of a resolution recentlyadopted by the Canadian N.A.T.O. Parliamentary Association. This association was founded by a group of Canadian Members of Parliament, including theGovernment Leader of the Senate, and we understand that they are in touch with members of the United States Congress.2. The resolution proposes a joint meeting of Members of Parliament fromthe N.AXO. countries to be held at the N.A.T.O. Headquarters in Paris nextJuly. The agenda suggested for the meeting is given in paragraph (2) of theresolution, the principal point being the establishment of a North AtlanticParliamentary Assembly.&apos;:!, 3. A copy of the resolution has been sent to Lord Ismay witha request that facilities for the meeting be provided at the Palais de Chaillot. Before deciding ona reply Lord Ismay intends to consult the North Atlantic Council.4. United Kingdom policy on the association of Members of Parliament withN:A.T.O. has been based on the Cabinet decision of 24th November, 1953(C.C. (53) 70th Conclusions, Minute 4). It was then agreed that we should not favour the establishment of a parliamentary body as a part of N.A.T.O.; we should,however, support efforts to form an international association of voluntary and non-official bodies in the N.A.T.6. countries. These efforts have now borne fruit in therecent establishment of the Atlantic Treaty Association, largely on the initiative ofthe British Atlantic!Committee. The Cabinet also agreed that we should encourageMembers of Parliament of N.A.T.O. countries to meet together and develop an informal association. The Norwegian Parliament is in fact trying to arrange ajoint.-visit to N.A.T.O. Headquarters of Members of Parliament from a number ofN.A;T.O. countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, this spring.. 5. The Canadian resolution clearly has implications which should be studied by the N.A.T.O. Governments, and before a decision is reached we should have,in particular, the views of the Canadian and United States Governments. Therewould be advantage in associating Members of the Canadian Parliament and theUnited States Congress more closely with the work of N.A.T.Oi and a joint meeting which they^ would attend with Members of Parliament Tromi other N.A.T.O.countries has therefore much to commend it. 1 still feel, however, that a parliamentary Atlantic Assembly is^ at best, premature and I am not satisfied thatin any of the proposals so far made sufficient thought has been given to the role of such an Assembly or to its composition, powers and functions. It would notbe helpful if the main purpose of the meeting proposed by the Canadian Associationwere to put pressure On theGovernments to establish^; such ;an Assfemoly^.&apos; Weshalltherefore! - try tb ensurethat if the meeting is to take place the agenda will bemuch more general than that suggested in the Canadian resolution. 1147661     &apos;Mii m s^\m^m^ l^Mlm w,m^r*m arm.
6. The United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the North atlantic council has been instructed to speak on these lines when the matter comes up fordiscussion. I think that our views will be shared by many of the other N.A/T.O.Governments.mV\ %t&amp;3 i A; -E.&apos;. foreign Office, S.W. 1,14 th February, 1955.RESOLUTION BY CANADIAN N.A.T.O. PARLIAMENTARY:ASSOCIATIONWhereas, The Canadian N.A.T.O. Parliamentary Association communicated with interested legislators in all N.A.T.O. countries a year ago expressing our desire to meet them to discuss common problems of political, economic andmilitary significance, and Whereas, The rapid development of world events,further emphasizes the urgent importance of a greater appreciation on the partof interested legislators, and the public generally, of N.A.T.O.&apos;s accomplishments,problems and potentialities:  Therefore be it resolved,That the Canadian N.A.T.O. Parliamentary Association in annual meetingassembled, direct the President of the Association again to communicate withinterested legislators in N.A.T.O. countries, making the following definite proposals:  V(1) That on July 18th, 1955, or some other mutually agreeable date,representative groups of interested legislators arrange to meet at theN.A.T.O. headquarters in Paris. The size of the delegations shouldbe determined by the respective countries themselves, but having regardto the physical and other limitations, we suggest that they range in numbers from 5 to 25. In view of the possibility that by that dateWestern Germany may have become a member of N.A.T.O., we direct the President to communicate with interested parliamentarians in thatcountry as well.(2), That the agenda of the proposed meeting should include the following;;    topics for discussion:  (a) The following resolution of the Canadian Parliamentary N.A.T.O.Association, namely:  &quot;Be it resolved that we, legislators of countries that are members of N.A.T.O., respectfully urge our respectiveParliaments that the necessary steps be taken to create a north atlantic Assembly of legislators, to meet at regular intervals,during such period as the North Atlantic Treaty remains in fullforce and effect.&quot;: (b) The progress that has been made in implementing the articles ofthe North Atlantic Treaty, particularly as respects Article 2.(c) The effectiveness of civil or parliamentary control over the armed forces allocated to the Supreme N.A.T.O.
