02p the Right Honourable&apos; q .     THE MINISTER OF L.A3UUR -JO NATION.\L SERVICEFINAL   REPORTiV\, 1.     life were appointed by you on 23rd December, 1954j under the provisionsof the Industrial Courts Act, 1919* with the following terms of .reference:-&quot;To inquire into the causes and cii-cumstonces of the dispute^between the British Transport Commission and workmen in the employmentof the Commission who are members of the National Union-of Roilwaymen,arising out of a claiiii by the Union for increased wag&apos;eg7, and to report.&quot;.2. In viev/ of the urgency of the matter we submitted to you on 3rd January -: an Interim Report setting out our conclusions on the major issues involved.In accordance with the terms of our appointment, we now have the honour to-submit the following Final Report,Introductory3.     17e hold a preliminary meeting in private on 29th December, 1954* andpublic sittings in London on 30th and 31st December, to hear the submissionsi of the parties and of other interested bodies.   We also met in private toI consider our reports.4.     The case for the National Union of Railwaymen was presented byMr. J. Campbell (General Secretary) and that for the British transport commission by Mr. W. P. Allen, G.B.E. (Chief of Establishment and Staff).: Statements wero also made on behalf of the Associated Society of Locomotive.I Engineers and Fireman by Mr. J. G. Baty (General Secretary) and on behalf ofthe Transport Salaried Staffs&apos; Association by Mr. W. J. P. Webber (general secretary).5.     The National Union of Railvaymen (N.U.R.) represents a wide range ofrailway employees, but the dispute before us was confined to those knownas &quot;conciliation staff&quot; - that is, the non-salaried workers within the scopeof the Machinery of Negotiation for Railway Staff described in paragraph  below, including the locomotive and traffic staff, those engaged in signaland telecommunications work and those employed in the handling of baggage,goods and rolling stock.   The precise numbers and details of both salariedand conciliation staff within the scope of this Machinery, for the weekending 27th March, 1954, are set out in Appendix I,   Of the conciliationstaff, the locomotive grades are represented jointly by the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (^.S.L.E.F.), which has themajority of members, and the N.U.R., and the other sections (Traffic,Permanent Y/oy, Goods and Cartage, etc.) by the N.U.R. alone.   The totalnuiribei- of- conciliation staff as stated to us by the British transport commission is about 350,000.6. &apos;   The Machinery also covers about 90,0*50 salaried staff whose represonta-tion is shared between the Transport Salaried Staffs&apos; Association (T.S.S.H..)and the N.U.R., the former having the majority of members.   We were informed that negotiations about the salaries of these grades were proceeding between the two Unions and the Commission and they were therefore agreed tobe outside the scope of our inquiry,7,     The present Machinery of Negotiation for Railway Staff was set up under anAgreement of 1935 between the Railway Companies on tho one hand and, on theother, the N.U.R,, the A.S.L.E.F. and the T.S.S.A, (then known as the RailwayClerics1 Association) and is still in force as between these three unions and the British Transport Commission.   At the national level the Machineryconsists of throe stagess-(a) Disoussions between the Union or Unions concerned and the RailwaysStaff Conference.   If there is failure to agree either side may refer to(b) the Railway Staff National Council, which is a joint body consistingof representatives of the Commission and of all three Railway.

For a proper understanding of tho eventn which lei; tj our appointment r.s a. Court of Inquiry it is necessary to ftp back to 20th July, 1953, when &quot;the throeRailway Unions presented a joint claim for en increase of 15 per cent, in the; wages of both the salaried and conciliation grades.   This claim v .s based mainlyupon the cost of living, comparison with rater, in outside industries andrecognition of increased efficiency and productivity.   Negotiate ins on the claimfailed to roach a settle-merit and tho matter was ultimately referred to theRailway Staff National Tribunal, through the appropriate machinery.The Agreement of December 1955-10.   On 3rd December, 1953, the Tribunal awarlel on increase of 4s. in the weekly wage of all railwaymen, with   T)&apos;pod;ioi;ato increases for women and juniors.This Award. (No. 15) was accepted by the Coj.Bidssion but was rejected by all threeUnions, the A.S.L.F..F. and the Ji.IJ-.it. threatening to withdraw the labour of their members as from 20th December unless in the meantime the matter had been satisfactorily resolved.   When subsequent meetings bet-.-.een the parties had failed to reach agreement you held further discussions with them and in theresult on agreement was reached on 16th December, 1953, in the following termsj-&quot;(l)   The British Transport Commission have confirmed their acceptance ofthe award of the Railway Staff National Tribunal for an increase in ratesof pay of salaried and conciliation staff.   They are ready to implement it.In the light of the following, this position is accepted by the Trade Unions.&quot;(2)   The British Transport Commission are prepared to examine with the TradeUnions their whole wage and salary structure.    The British transport commission contemplate that this examination would be completely exhaustive,without conditions of any kind.    Its purposes would be to correct anomalies/ and give added incentives (including differentials) in desirable cases;   and./   to&apos; investigate all standard rates of pay.&quot;(3)   At the same time the British Transport Commission and the Unions agreeto confer in order to evolve ways of increasing the efficiency of therailway organisation, not only by such adjustment of wages and salaries asmay result from the above examination, but by all other appropriate means.&quot;(4)-    Kocognising- tliit the comprehensive review of the whole wage and salary&quot;ntriictuxQ will necessarily take some considerable time and that the  natureof the claim made by the Unions before the Railway Slati National IribvmalPrecluded tho Tribunal from cslIxossxng itse.Lt to the question oi the levels of the standard rates of pay, and after consultation with Her Majesty^percentageTribunal Award No. 15.&quot;Sub sequent Ncgotiati ons11.   The further improvement of standard rates referred to in Clause (4) &quot;was imple-Uonted by an. agreement dated 1st February, 19541, for a 6 por&quot; cemt- increase in ,  , ,wages ana salaries to operate with efieet from 24th January.   Itus increase included the 4i*t awarded by the Tribunal, an&apos;! implemented under Clause (1 ).   Meanwhile, at meeting held on 22nd December, 1953&apos; to discuss the review oi the whole wagefci-ructure referred to in Clause (2), the Commission had asked the Unions to submit proposals for a new wage structure for consideration.   The three Unions submittedseparate proposals which were discussed at a meeting on 12th January, when theQoixiissipn made it clear that it would first be necessary to agree u]X&apos;n the basicMinimum wage (i,e the 1 -age payable to the adult male unslcilled&quot; worker).   Therefollowed somo months of negotiations on this point.
i 12-.     On 9 th June, 1954,   the Commission offered a baa to minimum wageK of 125a.riuing to 127a. after 12 months1 service (i.e. an increase of 6d. over thei existing rate of 124s. 6d. and of Is. 6d. for all those with one year&apos;a ser-vioe or more )    vj?his offer was accepted by the as a basis for furtheruiaouasxono but it was not acceptable Lo the A.S.L.E.F.  in reapcot of thei-rades in which they wore interested.     The A.S.L.L.F.  therefore initiateduoparate negotiations in respect of locomotive grades, the 1-J.U. ,1. Inter join-lng in on behalf, of their own members in these grades.     These negotiations were ultimately referred to the established conciliation machinery.Agreement of October 193413.     Meanwhile the discussions arising out of the Commission&apos;s offer of9th June, so far as relating to conciliation grades othor than locomotivestuff, continued between the Commission and the h.U.K.     Agreement was finallyreached on proposals which, together with an interim settlement for salariedstaff, wore fon.Tal.ly agreed on 11th October, 1954, at a mooting between representatives of the Commission and of all three lfnionu.      The jnoreasesagreed for the conciliation grades ran/red from the 6d. increase in the basicMinimum wage already mentioned to bs.  6d. and involved a few minor inodifica-tions in the wage structure of theao gradea.      An agreed Note to which thenew rates were appended set out the position in the&quot;following tori;ia:-&quot;Today&apos;s agreement is the culmination of negotiations arising out of theagreement made between the British Transport Commission and the TradeUnions at a meeting held, under the aegis of the Minister of Labour, on16th December, 1953-     /There followed a summary of that agreement, whichis quoted in full in paragraph 10 above^&quot;The improvements under olauaoa 1 and 4 of this:&apos;Agreement were effective from 6th December, 1953, and 24th January, 1954, respectively, and thoseariuing from today&apos;s Agreo-nent will operate from Monday, 4th October, 1954./Footnote:   Subject to ratification of date of operation by the M.U./-J./7Pull dotaila of the new rates of pay outside London are given in theaccompanying statement.      In London the adult rates are jj/- per week higherfor wages grades and J-UO per annum for salaried staff.&quot;In the case of Salaried Staff it is agreed that the settlement is an interim one and that there should be a thorough review of the salary structure including the basis of classification.&quot;The A.S.L.3S.F. raised no objection to the revision of the agreementsaffected by the above.&quot;(Footplate grades are excluded for the reason that the Unions&apos; claims./? on their behalf are being referred to the railway Staff National Tribunal)&quot;.The date of operation of the agreement (4th October) was ratified by the N.U.R.on 12th Ootober, 1954, and the new rates of pay were thereupon implemented.gho .-N.U.J.I. &apos;s Kejeotion of the Agreement.14.     On 11th November, 1954,  the JN.U..rt. wrote to the Commission informing them that the settlement of 8th Ootober was unacceptable to the membership of the Union as regards conciliation grades and seeking a meeting with a viewto reopening discussions on the basis of the original claim of July, 1953-The Railway Staff National Tribunals Award (No. 16) for Locomotive Grades15.     Four days later, i.e. on 15th November,  the Railway Staff NationalTribunal issued ita Award (No.  16) in respect of locomotive grades, having,hoard the parties on 4th and 5th November.     The Tribunal recommended increases in vagea for these grades ranging from 8.1&apos;- to 22.6;* over the rates applicableprior to 6th Dooember, 1953.      l&apos;hc proposed basic minimum rate (that for anengine cleaner) was 127a. rising to 129s. after 12 months1 service, i.c. anincrease of 2s. 6d. rising to 4a. 6d., on the existing rate.      This award wasnooopted by all parties, including the N.U.K. ,  on or about 24th November,1954.     A full statement of the pre-december, 1953, rates,  the Commission^offer and the Tribunals Award is set out in Appendix II.Further Discussions16.     Meanwhile, faoed with the rejection by the N.U.K. of the Agreement of6th Ootober, 1954, the British Transport Commission, at a meeting held between&apos; /themx   For employees in London the rates would be 3s. higher.BBS
them and the Union on 18th November, indicated their view that there was a binding settlement so far as concerned the staff covered by that Agreement and that the Commission were not prepared to reopen discussions on the original claim of July, 1953. They therefore asked that the Agreement which had been ratified should be signed by the N.U.R. and accepted as a completion of the negotiations which had preceded it. If, however, the Union had any further submissions to make, they would be free to make them in any way they wished and the Commission would receive them without any commitments on their part as to their attitude to any such approach. At a further meeting on ?th November the N.U.R. stated their position as follows:-

"1. That the Memorandum of Agreement arrived at on 8th October, 1954, should not be signed on behalf of the Union at least until an indication was received from the Commission that something tangible in the form of increased wages for the staff covered by the discussions was forthcoming.

"2. That on the question of the submission of a fresh application, as the original submission of the Union was for an increase of wages up to 15 per cent. of the rates applying prior to 6th December, 1953, this should be maintained as the policy of the Union."

The Commission repeated the views expressed by them on 18th November and added that they would be prepared to receive and consider any further wage application as a fresh submission to be dealt with on its merits and that if the N.U.R. were not satisfied it would be open to them to pursue the matter through the normal negotiating machinery.

The N.U.R.&apos;s Approach to the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.

17. The N.U.R. Executive Committee next decided to approach the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. The Minister received a deputation from the Union on 13th December, 1954, and replied by letter on 20th December. He first quoted a statement by the Commission of their position which after outlining the recent course of events continued:-

"In this situation the attitude of the Commission towards the claim now put forward by the N.U.R. is that they would be prepared to discuss through the appropriate machinery, and with all speed, any particular cases where anomaly is thought to have been created by comparison with the new level of wages for the footplate staff. However, the new N.U.R. claim goes much further than this and the Commission consider it to be essential that reference should be made to the R.S.N.T. on this claim on its merits in order that the conclusions of the body which produced a settlement for a part of the wages grades should also be available for the remainder. The Commission are convinced that a firm settlement for all the railway wages grades concerned can only be reached in this way.

 "If the R.S.N.T. should conclude that the N.U.R. claim should be met in whole or in part the Commission propose to consult with the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation on any consequences which acceptance of such a recommendation might entail in relation to their statutory duties under the Transport Act, 1947."

18. The Minister&apos;s letter then went on:-

"The Government are concerned to secure an improvement in the position of British Railways. They believe that such an improvement can be expected from the combined effect of modernisation of the Commission&apos;s plant and equipment, the greater freedom in charging provided for by the Transport Act, 1953, and the appropriate redeployment of labour on the railways. There is no reason to doubt that by a combination of these methods, and with the good will and co-operation of all concerned, the British Transport Commission will be able greatly to improve the prospects of their undertaking."

"After making full and careful examination both of the Commission&apos;s statement and of the views of the National Union of Railwaymen, the Government consider that, inasmuch as the normal processes of negotiation and arbitration have not been exhausted, they could not intervene without dealing a serious blow to the negotiating machinery in this industry and indirectly in the rest of industry as well. The Government could not properly substitute themselves for the British Transport Commission as parties to the wage negotiations. They are strongly of the opinion that the National Union of Railwaymen should take part in further discussions with the British Transport Commission in order to see whether agreement cannot be reached. They are convinced, however, that in the event of agreement not being reached, the right course for the National Union of Railwaymen is to take their claim to the Railway Staff National Tribunal in order that it may be considered, in the Commission&apos;s words "on its merits".

The Strike Decision

19. On 22nd December the General Secretary of the N.U.R. wrote to the /Commission
Commission referring to the Minister&apos;s aecision not to intervene and givingformal notice of his Executive&apos;s intention to instruct all members of the union to withdraw their labour as from midnight, 9th January,  1955,  in accordance withthe following decision:-&quot;That having considered the reply from the Minister of Transport.....it is clear we have exhausted all forms of negotiations on theabove question.&quot;&quot;As we are determined to win the balance of 15 per cent, on allRailway wages on pre-December,  1953, rates, we now decide to withdraw thelabour of all N.U.R. members in the Railway industry as from 12 midnight on 9th January.&quot;&quot;iVe instruct the General Secretary to call special meetings of all ourDistrict Councils on Sunday,  2nd January, 1955, in order to perfect ourstrike machinery in all Regions.&quot;This letter was acknowledged by the Commission without any comment orobservation on its terms or the: reasoning on which it was based., 20.     It was in view of this decision that you held, separate discussions on^3rd December with the Chairman of the Commission and representatives of theN-U.JA.     The Chairman confirmed the Commission&apos;s view that the claim of the N.U.R.ailould be referred to the Railway Staff National Tribunal on its merits.     The&amp;U.R. representatives, however,  did not consider that their case would be- Hsfactorily dealt with in this way.     They further stated that they couldonly agree to resume negotiations with the Commission if the Commission woreprepared to discuss their claim without regard to limitations placed on theCommission &quot;by their financial circumstances and with the prior assurance thatthoir claim would bo substantially met.     It proved impossible to resolve thisconflict of view, and it was in these circumstances that you ducided to appointus as a Court of Inquiry dnto the causes and circumstances of the dispute.igffi   COMTiStfTIONS   OX-&apos; . THE IPAmjSS21.   In explanation of the decision to withdraw the labour of all members of theUnion in the railway industry as from midiujbt,  9th January,  1955, Mr. Campbellstated that there was serious discontent among members of the Union with theexisting wage structure.     uhile it was agreed,  even by the Commission, thatrailway wages were in general too low, protracted negotiations had failed to fly &apos;h an acceptable settlement owing to the Commission&apos;s view of their financial, position.     The Union did not accept this viev/ as an insuperable barrier to aninorease in wages and saw no other course open to them than strike action.22.   /Mr. Campbell emphasised that the decision to call a nation-wide strike,8Uoh as had not been known on the railways for 35 years, had not been takenlightly.     The patience and restraint of railwaymcn, to which tribute had been paid in the past by many of those prominent in the industry, had been exliaustcd; after seventeen months of negotiations, at the end of which railway wages wereotill unreasonably low.     This was illustrated by the following weekly rates:-A -Goods Porter and other starting grades,  6   5s.    Od.;A Guard in his first year,  6 17s. Od., with a maximum of  7 11s. Od.A Shunter, who was oalled upon to perform dangerous work in all kinds ofweather,  7 Os. Od.A Signalman, in who.se hands the safety of the travelling public rested, 7 2s. Od. rising to  8 Os. Od. in Class 1.      (The bulk of Signalmenwere within these classes and few rose above them).A Lengthman who maintained the permanent way,  b 7s*, Od. to  b 12s. Od.,depending upon his years of sorvice;The skilled grade of Installer in the Signal and TelecommunicationsDepartment,  6&apos; 14s. Od. in Class 3, rising to a maximum of  ? 3s. Od.in Class 1.
&apos;f  . Thc undertaking 0f Lecembor, 1553* arising frora the Union&apos;s original claimoi July.  1933, to examine the whole of the wage structuro of the industry had raised high hopes amongst railwayman of a serious attempt to introduce a news^uoturc that would &quot;be more in keeping with present day circumstances and which&quot;ould place railway wages on a basis comparable with those of other industries.*ho Union&apos;s own proposals, which the Management admitted had some merit,envisaged a structure of 21+ rates,  instead of over 60 as then existing, rangingironi 135s. for basic grates to 195s. for experienced drivers and signalmen withiic&amp;vy responsibility.     These rates represented an incro-.se of approximatelyu per cent, on the rates prior to the agreement of December, 1953-     Owing,however, to the Commission&apos;s vie-;/ of the practical limits to increases in wagef-cvels, the negotiations had dragged on throughout the summer of 1954 andinstead of an ii.aginc.tivo approach to the problem it became a matter of&apos; difficulty&apos; obtain even an extra shilling or two.24    Against this background, the Executive Committee of the Union reluctantlyreached the settlement of October, 1954, which left between A-9 and 9 per cent,of the original claim for a 15 per cent, increase unsatisfied.     The settlementproved to be entirely unacceptable to the membership of the Union and lost itshould bo charged with being out of touch with the rank anf file, with thesorious probability of unofficial action,  the Executive Committee had felt that&quot;-he only honest and practical course was so to inform the Commission, with a request for the re-opening of negotiations on the basis of the originalsubmissions.     The Railway Staff National Tribunal&apos;s Award (No. 1b) concerninglocomotive grades,  issued a few -days later, served to emphasise the inadequacyOi the Commissions offer to other grades in the October agreement.F*.    Mr. Campbell explained the subsequent course of events, leading to the1 rike decision, in the following terms:-&quot;To comply with the suggestion of tho Commission that a now claim shouldbo submitted through the m.&quot;iohiviory of negotiation, v/ould have meant ignoringall that had gone before and commencing negotiations again in an atmosphere of hopolessness created by the Commission1s repeated plea that they could not raise the money.     Unfortunatcly, the farthest the Commission would go was togive an undertaking to speed the machinery of negotiation.     But there was asinister reservation.     They would not- commit themselves in any way, despite the fact that the Tribunal1 s Award No. 16 had made some adjustments inevitable.&quot;&quot;The N.U.R. Executive Committee felt that as long a s the Commissioncontinued to plead inability to meet the higher wages they expressed the wishto pay,  any new negotiations wore doomed to failure.     It was, therefore,decided to approach the Minister of Transport in the hope that some way couldbe found of enabling the Commission to pay reasonable wages while awaiting thefinancial benefits from their plans for tho future, namely, revised charges and modernisation.     The Minister &quot;was, however, unable to assist in clarify-ing the position beyond a rather nebulous repetition of the Commission&apos;sletter to the effect that if the Railway Staff National Tribunal awarded theUnion&apos;s claim in part or in whole,  the Commission would have to consult withthe Government.     My Executive Committee therefore concluded that the only hope of obtaining justice for the membership lay in calling upon them towithdraw their labour.&quot;2b.     The Union contended that railway wage rates were in general too low becausethey had failed to keep -pace with the rising cost of living and were unfavourableby comparison with other industries.     If a comparison was to be made between therise in the cost of living since the introduction of the new Interim Index ofKetail prices by the Ministry of Labour and Nationo.1 Service on 17th June, 1947*and the rise in the rates of railway wages since that date, it was necessary toallow for the increases in pay which had resulted from the findings of a Court of inquiry under the Chairmanship of Mr. C. &apos;ur. Cuillebaud.     This Court had beensitting at the elate of the introduction of the now Index and on 2Ath June had issued its Report, recommending an all-round immediate increase of 7s. b&amp;. and reporting &quot;an urgent need for detailed and&quot; exhaustive reconsideration of the wholetrading of the v serious classes,  scales and categories which make up the complicatedstructure of the railway service&quot;.     The 7s. 6d. increase was paid with effect from30th.- June and additional increases for certain grades arising from the reooixionda-tion as to rooognition of skill and responsibility wero paid with effect fromJst February, 1948.     Thus the rate of pay of a Station Foreran, for example, prior&apos; 0 the Report of the Court of Inquiry was 100s. 6d.     From 30th June,  1947, thatrate was increased by 7s. bd. to 108s. and from 1st February,&quot;1543* by a further5s. bd. .to 113s. bd., following upon the Court&apos;s recommendations.     Therefore,Mr. Campbell maintained, the real increase to bo taken into account for the purposeof comparison with tho rise in the cost of living since 17th June, 1947, vas thodifference between 113s. bd. and the present x-ate of 151&quot;*, 1*0. 37s. bd.     On this basis the percentage increase was less than 35 por cent (and not, as the Commission/SUBKOPt^r
Fh^ivw&apos; -&apos;^T^ iO per pent. cornered with the increase of 45 per cent, intho Index ixtfira.     Further ho oontericted tlvt it v/nr, wall known thai the Indexdid not rellocl the full increase in the ooiit of Living to the lowest paid workers.V.     Turning to comparison of wages on the railways with those in other industries the N.U.R. contended that the comparison should in justice he made between wageraten, rather than actual earnings.     Wot all railwayman had the opportunity ofincreasing their earnings by overtime, night work and rest-day working.     In anyorizp. it remained the Union1 s principle that the basic v/age should provide forWisio needs, while the man who worked overtime or durinp. night hours was justlyentitled to some extra payment.     Even on the basis of earnings, however, railway staff were poorly paid.     The average weekly ermings of male adult conciliationstaff for the week ended 27th March, 1954, wore 182s.  10d. for an average of 50working hours.     Yet according to Ministry of Labour statistics the average weekly.. earnings for the last pay week in April 1954, in all manufacturing industries were&quot;2fl5s. 2d. for 48.2 hours, in Mining and Quarrying (excluding coal) 190s. 1d. for- 49.1 hours and in Building and Contracting 193s. 1d. for 49.1 - hours.     The Unionalso produced figures to slmw that in order to raise their earnings to the level ofthe average for all manufacturing industries (205s. 2d.) or even the average for conciliation staff as a whole (182s. &apos;10d.) individuals in various particular gradeswould have to work an excessive number of hours.     In present conditions of full employment the security of railway work had little value to offset the higher wages paid for work of comparable skill and responsibility in other industries less arduousand dangerous.     Benefits such as concessionary travel, free uniform and protectiveclothing were of limited value, were not unknown in other industries, and in any casewore by no moans universally enjoyed on the railways.     Residential travel concessions in particular benefited only 30 par cent, of the staff.28.     Mr. Campbell compared the starting rate of an adult raiIwayman with the startingrate of a postman aged. 24 or over.     The postman like the railwayman -vas engaged ina public service and was provided with &apos;a free uniform but enjoyed superior benefits from a non-contributory pension scheme.     The postman-&apos;3 rate was 152s., rising after two years to&apos;166s.     For railwayman in many starting grades the rate wa3 125s. risingafter one year to 127s.     Perhaps twenty-five years&apos; service might bring promotion&quot;- to a grade rated at 162s.29.     The Union felt there was a connection between this unfavourable comparisonwith the wages paid, in other industries and the increasing shortage of manpoweron the railways, especially in tho more highly skilled, grades.     There were difficulties-ties in recruitment to certain grades and the net loss of skilled operatives to otherindustries had already begun to affect the efficiency of the railway service.While the rate of labour turnover on the railways might be lower than the rate forother industries, it should be &quot;borne in mind, that in tho case of the railways achange of employment was never merely a change of employer hut necessarily involvedleaving the industry.     The shortage of inanpower on the railways was, however,shov/n by   the number of staff performing work on their scheduled &quot;rest-day&quot;..    30th June, 1954, nearly 24,000 staff were employed at stations or depotswhore the rest day was not effective for any of the staff.30.     It was in the Union&apos;.s view untrue that there was heavy over-staffing on therailways.     A considerable amount of co-operation in measures for greater efficiencyhad taken place and between January, 1948, and September, 1954, there had been areduction of over 52,000 in the total staff employed.     The Union felt, however,that p. first essential was to remove a growing suspicion amongst railwaymen that no matter how hard they worked or what co-operation they showed, a reasonable wagewould be denied to them because of some statutory obligation, raised by theCommission as an insuperable obstacle to increased wages.31.     In the Union&apos;s view the financial problems of the railways were not newnor did they justify the existing wage rates.     Tho Commission^ view of their financial obligations had not prevented their acceptance of certain recent wage^awards, but they now held that their obligations under the Transport Actprevented   them from conceding the Union&apos;3 present claim.     If this was sofeme other way of paying reasonable wages must be found.     The finances of the production-war railway companies had for many years given rise to Government concern.Tho Commission in turn had moreover been handicapped since its inception by thelegacy of the hardware and restricted maintenance of the war years.     Yet. railway freight charges, according to the figures given by the Commission in their Annual;eport, were only 153 per cent, above pre-war, whereas General Wholesale Priceswore 223 per cent, above pro-war.     Passenger charges had increased on averageby 90 per cent, compared with an increase in retail prices of 134 per cent.The average level of railway costs (labour and materials) was now approximately175 per cent above pre-war.     The Union claimed thrt these figures in some degree/reflected
reflected the increased efficiency of the railway system in which theUnions had played their full part.     At the same time they were also an indication that to some extent other industries and the travelling public-were being subsidised by the railways, and that the level of railway wages had some relationship to this position.32.     The railways were essential in the national interest, and if therewas no immediate solution to the problem without Government help then theN.U.R. contended that such help should be forthcoming.     It was hoped that future plans would restore the solvency of the Commission, but the- railway.y-men&apos;s claims for reasonable wages could not meanwhile be set aside.     Suchplans could be operated in the most productive manner only by a happy endcontented staff.     The Union therefore suggested, not that the commission should receive an annual subsidy, but that it might be relieved for afew years of the financial burdens imposed by the Transport Act.British Transport Commission33.     Mr. Allen said it was the view of the British Transport commission that the decision of the N.U.R. to -withdraw the labour of their raemberswas entirely unjustified.     Y/hile the wages of railwaymen were, in theCommission1 s opinion, in general reasonable and in some cases good, theywere always prepare  ed to give speedy consideration on its merits to any claim&apos; for an increase in wages, but were not prepared to be committed inadvance to conceding an increase.   - On the other hand, in view of theirpresent financial position and their obligations under Section 3(4)  of&quot;the Transport Act, 1947, the &quot;Commission would have to consult with theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation on any consequence which anincrease in wages might entail. :34.     The Commission had always done their utmost to ensure that their staff were loyal and contented.     They denied that there had been undue delayon their part in the negotiations arising from the agreement of December, 1953.Clause (4) of that Agreement -was itself a recognition that such negotiations would toe lengthy.     A complicated wage structure involving 98 rates of paywas at issue, and the different attitudes taken up by the three Unions added*^o the Commission&apos;s difficulties.     The negotiations had in fact been concluded within ten months by the Agreement of October, 1954, ratified bythe Executive Committee of the N.U.R. but still unsigned.     The commission were prepared to discuss through the appropriate machinery, and with allspeed, any particular cases where anomaly was thought to have been created for some grades of men by the Railway Staff National Tribunal^ Awardconcerning locomotive grades,35.     In considering the general level of -wages the Commission did not agreethat actual earnings could be disregarded.     Payments over and above theminimum rate were gained, without working excessive hours, in the normal course of duty, -which in an industry working &quot;round-the-clock&quot; necessarilyentailed varying amounts of Sunday duty, Saturday afternoon duty and nightduty, at enhanced rates.     The statement of average rates of pay,earnings and hours worked in the principal conciliation grades for theweek ending 27th March, .1954H, showed that average earnings were considerably/greaterjc    This statement is reproduced in full as Appendix III,
;-;:roater than avorago ratoo of pay, average earnings for-all grades being&apos; approximately &quot;[83s. for an average week of 50 working hours.     These figuresrelated to a period prior to the. operation of the Agreement of October, 1 95k-, andof the Ti-ibunal1 b Award No. 16 concerning locomotive grades.     The effect of these increases on average .,arnia. .s would in some cases be considerable.X   With regard to the cost of living, I&apos;.Ir. Allen submitted figm-es in supportof the Commission&apos;s contention that the increase in the wa.ge rates of conciliation grades, with few exceptions, had exceeded the 45 per cent, increase, in the Interim Index of He-tail Prices since its inception in June, 1947.     the validity of this comparison depended on the exact dates chosen for the basis.oP computation.     railway.vmen had also improved their position by comparison with&quot;ie official Index of rfage Rates published by the Ministry of Labour and national Service, which had increased by A3 per cent,  in the same period.Moreover changes introduced during recent years in the enhanced rates of payment for certain periods of duty had enabled earnings for normal turns of duty to bestill further increased.57*   The Commission were mindful of the relationship between the wages of railwaymen and those of other workers.     In the first place they liad to haveregard to the rates paid in the railway workshops, which had for many yearsapproximated at the basic grade to the minimum rates both on the railways andin general engineering.      The Commissions staff engaged in road haulage andbus 3ervice3 inevitably pressed for similar treatment and the rates determinedby the appropriate bodies dealing with other transport undertakings, such as theivpad Haulage Wacres Council and the National Council for the Omnibus Industry,could not be overlooked.     Average earnings in the Transport Industry (excludingsea transport) for the last week in April,&apos; 1954, were shown in the followingAverage AversgoEarnings HoursTramways and Omnibus Service 178s. 4d. 49*8(excluding London Transport)Goods Transport by road (excluding 1863. 53.british Road Services)Harbour, Dock, Canal, Conservancy 193s.    1d. 49.5etc. , Services.Transport and Communications,  (excluding. &quot;*      183s.    6d. 50.1Railways, London Transport and - ,British Road Services.)Railway Conciliation Staff (week ending 183s. 50/   27th March, 1954).38.    In submitting these figures the Commission emphasised that regard must bepaid to the free and reduced rate travel facilities, uniforms and protectiveclothing provided for railway staff.      These facilities had a substantial cashvalue.   ^ For example, a member of the Commission1s staff employed at Euston andresiding at Harrow would pay nothing for his travel to and from work, thussaving . 26 a year - 10s. a week - in fares.     Moreover a contributory pensions scheme had been introduced for wages staff on 1st October, 1954.      The minimum age retirement pension payable would be 9s. 9d. per v/eek rising to 40s. per weekaccording to years of membership.39.    The Commission suggested that the shortage of manpower in the industry, towhich attention had been drawn, was less a matter of rates of pay in the industry,than a consequence of national conditions.     Tliroujhout the country there were large numbers of unfilled vacancies with relatively few applicants, and the railwayindustry was, on the whole, standing up well in the face of keen competition formanpower.     The number of conciliation staff leaving the service of their own accord had shown a steady decline over the past few years, and in the first sixmonths of 1954 there was an intake of 27,682 to offset a wastage of 27,723 - anet loss of 41 over all grades, some of which had in fact gained.     During the12 months ended 6th November, 1954, the estimated annual turnover of employees per100 among railway conciliation staff was 19.6, compared with 32. 7 amongstemployees in the manufacturing industries./AO.
40. The Commission agreed, however, that there was not, in general, heavy over-staffing on the railways. Over recent years the Railway Management had effected considerable economics including a reduction in total manpower from 630,000 in 1947 to 583,000 at the end of 1954; if these economies had not been made it would be impracticable to pay salaries and wages at their existing levels. There had also been many improvements in methods of working during recent years which gave increased output without any materially increased effort on the part of the staff concerned. Some examples of these improvements were cited; increased use of mechanical appliances at Goods Depots, including conveyor belts, fork-lift trucks, the use of power-driven trolleys and of mobile cranes; the extended provision of mechanical coal-handling plant at Motive Power Depots; the increased use of mechanical appliances for permanent way maintenance and renewals, including truck-laying machines, ballast-cleaning and tamping machines, together with rail-lifting devices; the extended use of office mechanical appliances; the extension of signalling concentration schemes. There was in addition the general plan for modernisation which it was hoped to introduce in the near future. It was, however, to be borne in mind, that improvements effected by the Railways for the benefit of the staff and the travelling public, sometimes involving heavy additional maintenance costs, were not always remunerative to the Commission.

41. The Commission claimed to be not ungenerous in their treatment of staff who might be adversely affected by measures of economy, but felt there was a general atmosphere of restriction which hampered their efforts, especially at local level where the implications might not always be fully understood. They instanced the serious stoppage of work on the Western Region on the introduction of certain additional lodging turns of duty, at the very time when the Unions were committed by the agreement of December, 1953, to assisting the Commission in improving the productivity of the industry. In fact, the Commission&apos;s attempts with regard to improving efficiency had been brought to a halt by the lack of agreement on wages.

42. In a review of the Commission&apos;s financial position Mr. Allen stated that, quite apart from the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Transport Act, 1947, the Commission considered it right that, as a commercial undertaking, they should pay their way. During the first three years of its existence the Commission as a whole had accumulated a deficit of £40 million. By 1953 this deficit had been reduced to £27 million, but was estimated to have increased during 1954 by a further £15 million, and on present showing was likely to increase during 1955 by a further £25 million. This estimated deficit in the Commission&apos;s general finances would be due to an even greater deficit in the contribution of British Railways to the central charges of the Commission. Those central charges were principally interest charges of various kinds on capital and loans, together with a comparatively small item for central administrative expenses. The contribution fixed by the Commission for British Railways was £40 million.  This represented 9 per cent. of receipts and 3 per cent. of net book assets. It was less than had been anticipated when the Commission was first established.

43. For 1954 the surplus of receipts over working expenses of British Railways was estimated at only £18 million; in other words, British Railways&apos; contribution to the central charges of the Commission would be deficient by more than £20 million. During 1955 world be felt for the first time the full effect of wage increases arising from the settlement of February, 1954, the Agreement of October, 1954, and the Tribunal&apos;s Award No. 16 of November, 1954. The total cost of these increases for 1955 was estimated at £22 million. There must also be added the cost of the Commission for the full year of the contributory pension scheme introduced on 1st October, 1954, estimated at £21/2 million, and increases in National Insurance contributions. On the other hand the full year&apos;s benefit would be felt from the increase in freight charges made in March, 1954. Taking these factors into account the net surplus over working expenses in 1955 was estimated at only £10 million, i.e. British Railways would be in deficit by a further £30 million.

44. This was a matter of grave concern to the Commission and active measures were being taken to deal with the situation by continuing to seek for all possible economy and efficiency and by curtailing unremunerative services. These, however, could not be sufficient to put matters right and a substabtial deficit was likely to remain; any further wage increases would make this deficit even larger.

45. A possible means of covering it would be by increasing fares and freight charges. The Commission, however, did not regard it as proper to pass on to the public the cost of further wage increases unless it were decided that the existing level of wages was unreasonably low. In any case British Railways were only a part of the transport system of the country and many of its services were highly competitive. Regard must therefore be paid to the level of charges made by other forms of transport, for example road haulage. Wages represented two-thirds of the Commission&apos;s working expenses and if these were raised out of relation to those paid elsewhere, in the transport industry there was a real danger that the Commission would be priced out of the market and the role of the railways in the national economy seriously diminished. /SUBMISSIONS BY OTHER BODIES

* These are quoted in full in paragraph 54 below.
o&quot;JBiAIooIOi\o BY OTiiER BODIESAsspciated Society ofi Lpopgiptiye Epjgjipers^ &amp; Pirerioti46.   Mr. Baty said that although members of his Society were not directly involved in the present dispute thoy had an indirect interest.   During and since tho second Uorld V/ar relativities within the railway wages sti-ucture(i.e. the relation of tho pay of various grades one to tho other) had becomesoriously distorted by successive flat-rate increases.    The Railway StaffNational Tribunal&apos;s Award No.l6 of November, 1954, had gone some way, although not as far as tho Society would have wished, towards restoring the position,while they did not regard tho new rates for locomotive staff as satisfactorythoy had reluctantly accopted them and Would watch future developments to seethat no furjher distortion of relativities took place.   In particular, theSociety felt that adult engine cleaners were fully entitled, owing to the nature-of their work, to a higher rate than the basic rate for other conciliation staff.47.   As regards finance, the Sooiety had always considered that the burdensplaced upon the British Transport Commission under the Transport Act, 1947,wore oxconsivo.    Railway faros and charges had in rooont years rison far los3than tho prices of materials usod by the railways, and it was entirely wrongthat the wages of railwaymen should be depressed in order indirectly to subsidise other industries.Trap sport Salaried Staffs1 Association48.    Mr. IVebber said that as the dispute before the Court concerned onlyconciliation staff, his Association did not propose to intervene.   TheAssociation and tho N.U.R. wore at present negotiating with the british transport Commission on behalf of the salaried staff.   Ho wished to mako itoloar, however, that tho Association wore far from satisfied with tho position.It load token 15 months of negotiations to reach an interim settlement and 3incethen a farther throe months had olapsod.   Excessive Importance should not beattached&apos;to the spocial travel concessions enjoyed by railway staff.   Some ofthese had been in existence for many years, while loss than 30 per cent of theBtaff were able to take advantage of tho residential travel facilities.THE ^COURT&apos;S COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONSCommentary on Negotiations       -49.   We would first recall that in October, 1954, the N.U.R. accepted revisedrate3 of pay which had been settled as a result of negotiations which followedfrom the previous Agreement of 16th December, 1953j   that Agreement, which hadfour heads, is quoted in full in paragraph 10 above.    The October Agreement,after being ratified and accepted by the Executive of the Union, was thereafterrejected following pressure by the membership.   Such a &quot;step was, we were informed, without procodent in railway wage negotiations and was certainly in breach of the fundaxnental principle governing any industrial negotiation, thatAgreements once\mado should be honoured.   The N.U.R. Executive was fullyempowered to negotiate and conclude an effective agreement on behalf of themembers of the Union, subject only to challenge er appeal at the Union&apos;s annual conference.   No evidence was put&apos; before us of any attempt by the Executive to influence their members or to persuade them to aocept the Agreement which hadbeen negotiated on their behalf.   The rejection was all the loss defensiblesince it was tho rejection of a settlement which itself was intended to implementone part of a widor Agreement which not only provided for increased, images, butalso* pledged the Railway Unions to co-operate in increasing productivity and improving efficiency.   This point is of importance because tine Commissions-readiness to consider claims for higher wages and salaries was specificallylinked with the acceptance of that obligation by tho N.U.R. and the other unions associated in the Agreement of December, 1953.50.   The N.U.R.&apos;s subsequent stipulation that thoy would negotiate only if their claim was to be re garde d as a continuation of that made by them in July, 1953,was, rro consider, wholly unjustified.   That claim had boon for an all-rcundincrease of 15 per cent.    It had for all practical purposes been superseded bythe Agreement of December, 1953, which provided for the revision not only of standard ratos of pay but also of the clifferentials between grades.   Further,by tho Agreement of Ootober, 1954, certain modifications had already been madein the pre-December, 1953, wages structure.   Thus the N.U.R.&apos;s attitude on tinsmatter was not only unjustified but also wholly unrealistic.    It is a matterof surmise that this attitude was adopted merely to enable the Union to maintain that it had exhausted the possibilities of negotiation, as it was bound to do/under
under the Agreement of 1935, and no would be justified in resorting to strike action if its demands were not met. If this were so it was surely an unworthy expedient. Another strange feature is that though the N.U.R. Executive, on the insistence of its members, had rejected the Agreement of October, 1954, and was even prepared to precipitate a Nationwide strike as part of its campaign, the working members of the Union continued, throughout, to accept the extra pay granted them under the very Agreement which they had forced their Executive to reject.

51. A further point which requires condemnation is the N.U.R.&apos;s insistence that the Commission should, before negotiations even began, give a guarantee that a substantial part of the claim would be conceded. We consider such a requirement to be wholly improper as tending to reduce all industrial negotiation to a farce; and Mr. Campbell on behalf of the Union admitted that acceptance of it would be "foreign to his experience".

52. Such extraordinary conduct from the responsible representatives of a great Trade Union calls not only for condemnation but also for analysis. In our view, a partial explanation will be found in the exasperation and sense of frustration engendered by the nature of the replies made by the Commission to the N.U.R.&apos;s claims for increased wages. These are aptly summarised in the words Sir Brian Robertson used at a formal meeting between the parties in August, 1954, in the course of the negotiations which led to the Agreement of October, 1954. Sir Brian said:-

"You used an expression which struck me as being very apt. You said there were very different ideas as to the distance to be covered. There is not so much a difference of opinion here, there is only a difference arising from the fact that the practicabilities of the business bear upon us very immediately and we feel unable to escape them at every turn. We do not regard the proposals we have put forward as being ideal or final. When you say to us that people who work on the Railways are not paid as well as those in other industries and are not paid enough, you will find a broad measure of agreement from our side. It is when it comes to finding the answer to that dilemma that we are unable to reach a settlement with you....... It is a question of money. I said that our proposals are not regarded as being ideal or final. We regard that as being the limit of what is practical at this time".

53. This means that in August, 1954, the Commission were, in fact, saying that while they agreed in broad terms that railway workers were not paid enough, the limits of concession had been reached because money could not then be found to pay any more. As both sides were aware of the terms of the statute under which the Commission operates this could be, and obviously was, interpreted by the N.U.R. as referring to what was practical having regard to the statutory obligations of the Commission. Mr. Allen, for the Commission, placed before us, in December, 1954, figures to support the contention that railwaymen were adequately paid by comparison with workers in other industries; at the same time he employed the argument that higher wages could not be paid by the Commission from their own resources consistently with the discharge of their duties under the Transport Act, 1947, and particularly Section 3(4) thereof. We can fully appreciate the force of an argument that workers are adequately paid in light of what they can and do earn in comparison with other industries, and also the force of an argument that for reasons of financial stringency resulting from economic or other causes a wage regarded by the employer as appropriate cannot be paid. But it is when both are urged at once or alternatively that we have difficulty, because these two arguments have a basic inconsistency. If the wages offered or paid are already fair and reasonable in relation to those paid in comparable industry, it cannot at the same time be said /that
, that, in the words of Sir Brian Robertson, &quot;people who work on the railwaysire not paid, as well as those in other industries and are not paid enough&quot;,I   or that the reason for their not being paid enough is the financial limitationimposed by an Aot of Parliament.The ^0,ni)d.c-.^ioh\;;&apos;2:li&apos;&apos;:?.1\cAa.l  (bjLi^^ohs54.   Reference to the statutory financial obligations of the Commission had thusplayed an important part in the course of these negotiations and in view of theimpression which was created in the minds of the N.U.R. Executive we have(examined carefully the circumstances in which these obligations were used inargument and the implications and inferences arising from them.   Section 3,sub-section (4) of the Transport Act, 1947,.reads as follows:&quot;All the business carried on by the Commission, whether or not arisingfrom the undertakings or parts of undertakings vested in them by orunder any provision of this Act, shall form one undertaking, and theCommission shall so conduct that undertaking and, subject to theprovisions of tnis Act, levy such fares, rates, tolls, dues and other charges, as to secure that the revenue of the Commission is not lessthan sufficient for making provision for the meeting of charges properlychargeable to revenue, taking one year with anotner&quot;.^5.   The pnrase &quot;taking one year with another&quot;, familiar enough in the context of rating legislation, is not defined in the Act and is probably not capable ofpreoise definition or interpretation.   We apprehend, however, that it must beregarded as a direction to the Commission, so to conduct its affairs that oversuch a reasonable tract of time as.their experience and discretion show to be appropriate, their revenue and expenditure are brought to balance;   in other words, that the pnrase is sufficiently elastic to permit the Commission to inoura deficit in a,y one year, or even in suooessive years, provided that in their long term estimate of their prospects they can see their way to an overallbalance.   In reply to our enquiries the Commission conceded that the Agreementof October,  1954, nnd the subsequent Award      No. 16 of the Railway StaffNational Tribunal were accepted by them in the knowledge that for 1955 theestimated expenditure of the railways, including contributions to centralcharges, would as a result exceed the estimated revenue by an even larger amountthan had been previously forecast.   Three points are to be noted here,   First,that the Commission were prepared to accept the position that they could, in fact,honour an agreement and an award to pay increased wages which would have theresult of involving them in a substantially increased deficit in one particularyear.   Second, that the figures quoted to us   were related to estimates for oneyear alone, probably because no accurate estimate could be made for future years;aad third, th\t nothing   was said by the Commission as to what was tho term ofyears on the basis of which they were in fact hopinpj to implement their statutory obligation, nor as to the effect which the increases already granted and being paid woro expected to have, either in requiring a modification oftheir estimate of the appropriate term of years, or upon their prospects ofmaking ends meet within that term.   It is only fair to add that Mr. Allenin reply to the Court did state that in order to reach agreement (in October, 1954)the Commission offered increased rates of pay &quot;which it was generally felt the finances of the Commission could hardly justify but we hoped thai by securingco-operation and indeed getting that help in the direction which would seek toreduce waste and incrorse efficiency the fear in that direction could benullified.&quot;   In light of all this it does not appear that a necessary acceptanceof their statutory obligation does by itself operate as a bar to the payment ofwhat may bo determined to be adequate and proper wages for efficient service,unless a situation has been reached where the imposition of further burdens ofexpenditure makes the ultimate achievement of the Commission^ statutory dutyover their chosen period of years an impossibility.56.   This is our assessment of tne difficult points of construction and of argumentupon this matter of statutory obligations, an assessment which lias been retchedonly after careful consideration of the prepared arguments which were put beforeus by both sides at the Inquiry.    It is easy to understand how readilymisapprehension could arise in the minds of the negotiating committee of the N.U.R.Executive when arguments based directly or inferentially upon this otatuibo we o/used
used by -the: Commission, during their protracted negotiations, as a reasonfor not being able to offer higher wages.    The impression made upon theUnion by these arguments of the Commission was clearly put by Mr. Campbellwhen he said this:&quot;Surely it is not sufficient for them /I.g. the Commission^ to say,in effect,   &apos;The obligations which Parliament has placed upon usare proving unbearable. They prevent us from paying decentwages.   But, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it but to wait and see whether our new freight charges schemeand our somewhat distant plans for modernisation will helpmatters.1   Tho plain truth is that railwaymen are not preparedto wait that long. They demand, and they are entitled to demand,a f; .ir wage now.&quot;The Commission&apos;a Fiivuioia1 Porecaotn57.    To contrast with the previous arguments of Sir Brian Robertson as to the capacity of the Commission to pay increased wages we would refer to whatwas said by Mr. Allen in his written argument before us:-11 .Tn 1955 British Railways will have to meet, for a full year,the wages increases granted during the year 195A as well asthe cost of the new Pensions Scheme for wages staff, and increases in National Insurance contributions.   On the other hand,they will have tho benefit for a full year of the increase in freight charges made in March last.   Allowing for these factorsBritish Railways&apos; Not Receipts in 1955 might well bo no morethan  10 million, i.e.  30 million short of their propercontribution to Central Charges.   For the Commission as a whole the outturn for 1955* on the same basis of estimation as forBritish Railways, might be a deficit of the order of  25 million.&quot;      This is a matter of great concern to the Commission and active measures are being taken to deal with the situation.   First,the Commission will continue, as in the past, to seek for allpossible efficiency and economy in operation; and in this the staffcon render great assistance - for example, by stopping some ofthe restrictive practices to which reference has already beenmade.   The Commission will also proceed with the curtailment oftheir more seriously unremunerative services, particularlypassenger services.&quot;\      Steps of these kinds can, however, hardly be sufficient toput things right.   A substantial deficit is likely to remain whiohmust be met by the publio somehow, since the Commission has noreserves.    If further increases in wages are now to be granted, thisdeficit will be correspondingly increased.    The possibilities ofcovering the rlefioit by increasing fares and freight charges are,in the view of the Commission, limited by the following considerations.&quot;        British Railways are only a part - even if an important part -of the transport industry of the country.   Some of the railway services may bo monopolistic to a greater or lesser extent; but many are highlycompetitive.   While the Commission would be able to raise fares and charges in many directions, it would not, in their judgment, be proper to meet the cost of still further increases in wages by attempting to pass them on to the public - unless, of course, it is decided that the existing level of wages is unreasonably low.&quot;        Nven so, fares and charges cannot be raised without regard to thecharges made by competitive forms of transport - road hauliers, sea,air, etc. - and the operating costs of undertakings who run their ownroad haulage vehicles.    It follows that if the wages paid by theCommission (whioh represent two-thirds of their working expenses) areraised out of relation to the wages paid elsewhere in the transport industry, the Commission will-,suffer eompetitively and the presentbalanoe of the transport industry, will be seriously disturbed.   Thereis a real danger that many of the Commission&apos;s services would bepriced out of the market and the role of the railways in our national economy seriously diminished.&quot;/58. There are
?8.    There are tr.ro po.aaap.oa in this nr^umont to which wc feel hound to drewparticular Attention.     Tho first is the passage,&quot;While&apos;, the Commission would ho able to raise fares and charges in many directions, it would not in their judgment be proper to meet the costof still further increar.es in wagon by attempting to pass them on thepublic - unless of course it is decided that the existing level ofwages is unreasonably low&quot;,aid the second,&quot;A substantial deficit is likely to remain which must bo met by the publicsomehow, since the cor.imission lias no reserves.&quot;The- first implies thnt increased wages (if it is decided that the present ones arcunreasonably low) might be met by increased charges, subject to their regainingcompetitive with those ruling in rival forms of transport.     It does not mean that the statutory obligations of the Commission mice it impossible to meet suchan increase.     The second passage appears to suggest, on the other hand,  that under existing conditions of operation and expenditure the Commission is facedv.lth a deficit which it cannot meet on its present financial basis, and whichtherefore must be met &quot;by the public somehow&quot; - whether by increased charges or in some other form is not specified.     By contrast to both, Sir BrianRobertson&apos;s words appear to concede the; case for an improvement in wages inprinciple, but to place the Commission&apos; s answer to that claim firmly and solely on the proposition that in fact the Commission were not able to offer such wagesis they would consider proper, because of the financial limits of their capacity to pay, due to the necessity of their meeting their statutory obligations.     Itpas to this statutory argument, as we have now analysed it and as it appears tous it must have impressed itself on the minds of the N.U.R. Executive,  thatthe last sentence of paragraph 10 of our Interim Report v/as directed.The Crux of the Dispute59.     It appeared to us, therefore, both from the narrative of events and of negotiations, and from our examination of the contentions used by the Commission,that they had been endeavouring to meet the Union&apos;s claims on lines of argumentv/hich are mutually contradictory, and we consider that it is very largely because.of this contradiction in basic assumptions that the position of deadlock betweenthe parties was reached.  .  It is here, therefore, that the crux of the difficultyix) the dispute between the Commission and the N.U.R. arose.6ome General Ccrurl derations60.   In (paragraph 10 of) our Interim Report we dealt with this point andothers arising from it, and as. they are of the gravest importance and need further amplification in a Final Report such as this, we deal withthem somewhat more fully again. &apos;   We stated that the Nation had provided byntntute that there should be a nationalised system of railway transport, andthat this must therefore be regarded as a public utility of the first importance for v/hich the Nation must be prepared to mate all necessary  !:arrangements to see that it is efficiently run.    Y/e continued that it shouldnot be expected that a rate of wages was to be established less than that being paid in cbmparab\e industry.     YYe did not at this point deal withthe rates at present being paidj   the point we wished, to stress was thedanger of attempting to hold rates at figures other than those related to similar competitive industry.6&quot;!.     It is implicit in all this that the wage mu3t be properly earned, andthat to be a &quot;fair wage&quot; it must be not only no lower than it should be, butalso no higher than it should be.     The right to receive a fair and adequatewage is no more than this.
i6a62,     Where (as in the case of the Commission) the employer is hound to keepJus business going and can neither shew a working profit, nor shift the scene. of his operations, nor reorgnniso his capital structure, nor be vnxmd up bynis creditors, then the factors which are understood by all as affecting the wage rates in normal industry are absent.     The conditions in his business erecoftirooroially speaking, artificial and&apos;it therefore becomes necessary to falllack on the expedient of relating tho wages he should pry to those paid&quot;ini&apos;such comparable industries as may be found.     Both sides in their argumentsbefore us accepted the view that it was relevant, and  proper to have rornrd to/wages paid in comparable industry, and both referred in support of their cases to wage rates and earnings in other industries.63.     It must be kept in view, as Mr. Allen pointed out, that the commission has to compete in the labour market with other industries for adequate and sufficient labour, and must therefore offer suitable rates and opportunities to attract, labour of the required standard of skill and responsibility.      ;*    &apos;   .Section 3(l) of the Transport Act, 1947, as amended bv the transport act, 1953, requires the Commission to have due regard in exercising their powers under the Act to &quot;efficiency, cconoTy, and safety of , .operation, and to the needs of the public, agriculture, commerce, and ;-industry.&quot;1 l,ne provision of an adequate, skilled, and responsible labour force nifty clearly be regarded as one of the essential means of achieyinrj theend of efficiency and a necessary means to be provided and used by the?.vomm.lssion in performing the duty laid on them by the Act.   Although the &quot;means&quot;oy which the Commission is to find the amount needed to pay whatever the appropriate body may decide to be the right wages are not ours to decide, the primary means&apos;would, as Mr. Allen assured us, naturally lie in the establishment&apos; of effective&quot;productivity.     Meanwhile, under&apos; the present circumstances of the railways, wehave suggested thr.t tho appropriate wages can only be arrived at by relation tothose in comparable industry, as.nearly as such cart be found.64.     But again it is fundamental that the employer is entitled to expect, and the employee is bound to give, a fair day&apos;s work for a fair day&apos;s wage.     It isfurther clear that in this case both employee and employer alike must be under a particular obligation to join in making effective all measures whichare necessary and reasonable for the improvement of productivity and the promotion of efficiency.     This is in the terms of the Agreement&apos;of 16th December,&quot;1953 by -which the N.U.K. and the other Kni Iway Uniting are still bound.     Indeedthis obligation was recognised and accepted by tho N.U.R.  in the course of ourhearings, though the Commission stated that slow progress was &quot;being made in itseffective implementation, due in part at least to the difficulties which had. jnfronted the parties in their negotiations on the wagos issue.\65.     It is further implicit in any properly run industry that it should notbe called upon to carry redundant staff, and- this again applies particularly tothe railways in their present financial position and with their obligation to thepublic to ensure efficiency arid economy in working.     On this point it wasplainly   stated by Mi-. Opjnpbell that in the Unionrs view the railways wore notheavily&apos; over-staffed;   and Mr. Allen agreed that, using the expression in itsbroad sense, it was true that there is &quot;no question of the railways beingheavily over-staffed&quot; - though lie qualified hi.3 agreement by mentioning thatin some directions there is still room for economies in the numbers employed.This qualification left doubt in our minds and we feel that further clarificationon tliis very important point may be necessary.     This is one of the matters to which paragrpahs 67 and 76 liave reference.66.     These are but some of the; means by which tho end to which we referrednight bo achieved  4^e-^h?oA4-f5dr.&apos;n-a-d1^ 11 luP.?&quot; t Kranwilrrr^t-^rztvin-nf-:lrtla^^&apos;.^jrwrreiwrt---&apos;but they directly arise from the obligations which must beaccepted by workers in the industry as implied in any claim by them toreceive an adequate wage.     These views do not appear to us in airy way totraverse the/directions
directions contained in Suction 3(4) of the 1947 ^ct, which necessarily presupposethat the duty which is there laid upon the Commission can by efficient and prudentmanagement bo performed and an overall balance of revenue and expenditure arrivedat over a puriod of yo/.ro.     And it would bo difficult to Uuny that ono of thorequisite instruments to that end is a properly balanced, adequately paid and efficiently working labour force, or that it is the function of the Commission toobtain and use such an instrument.6/.   Our terms of reference,  as sot out at the beginning of this Report, are confined to the inquiry into causes and circumstances of the dispute between thehritish Transport Commission and the N.U.R. arising out of a claim by the union for inoroanod wagon.     \/o are not empowered, nor would wo rogard ourselves asqualified in view of the limited timu at our disposal, to express any concludedopinion as to tho improvementa in economy and efficiency which might still bo madeon the railways or as to the effects which such improvements might have upon their capacity to earn revenue.     Vie do, however, make certain observations inparagraph 76 which we feel are justified in light of the statements of both parties.68.   If paynent of increased wages is deemed desirable and necessary, while it isnot within our reference to investigate the sources from which such increases areto be financed, we would draw attention to the passages which we have alreadyquoted in paragraph 58 from Mr. Allen&apos;o submissions on behalf of tho Commission asindicative of the sources from which it is apparently contemplated by the Commissionitself that any necessary wage increases might be financed.The adequacy of present wage rates69.   In paragraph 11 of our Interim Report we stated that &quot;many figures were presented to us from both sides to demonstrate, on the one hand, that the railwaymanwas worse off than his colleague in other industries and, on the other,  that he wasin receipt of a fair wage by comparison with other industrial workers.&quot;     the submission by both sides of evidence as to nates and earnings in other industrieswas, as we have already noted, a tacit acceptance that it is relevant and proper tohave regard to such comparisons in determining the adequacy of the railwaymanswage.     In assessing the value of these comparative figures, regard must be had tothe benefits which are enjoyed by railwaynen but are not generally available towoi-kers in other industries;    these include free and concessionary travel, uniform(where provided) and the recently introduced contributory pension scheme for wagesstaff.     The cash equivalent of these benefits per head is not capable of accuratecalculation, but there is no doubt that they have a real value and that they mustbe taken into account.     A3 against this, most railway workers do not have the someopportunity of enhancing their earnings by piece-work or bonus schemes as doworkers in many other industries, while it has always to be kept in mind that manygrades of railway staff (like workers in other public services) are liable to becalled upon for duty at varying times of the day or night.70.   In the course of the arguments before us concerning basic rates in comparableindustries, reference was particularly made to the railway workshops (which are,as already indicated,  outside the scope of the dispute mentioned in our terms ofreference).     Here members of the N.U.R. are employed side by side with membersof trade unions affiliated to the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions, and the N.U.R. is represented, together with the Confederation, on theRailway Shopmen&apos;s National Council through which are negotiated the wages andconditions of employment of the railway workshop employees totalling 12A,000.The type of work done in these establishments obviously lias affinities with general engineering, and we were informed that so far back as 1922 an Award of theIndustrial Court laid down that in fixing wage rates for employees in railway work-shops regard should be paid to prevailing rates in the general engineering industry as well as to those for railway conciliation grades.     At the time of our inquirythe basic rate for unskilled grades in railway workshops was 124s. 6d. (the sameas that for unskilled conciliation grades on the railways immediately before theAgreement of October, 1954), while the basic rate in the general engineering industry was 124s. 10d.     Shortly before the beginning of our inquiry the Employees&apos;Side of the Railway Shopmen&apos;s National Council liad put in a claim for wage increases of 15s for skilled workers, 12s 6d. for semi-skilled and 10s. 6d. forunskilled;   and this claim was, we were informed, under consideration.     A claim on somewhat similar lines had already been put forward by the Confederation shipbuilding and Engineering Unions on behalf of workers in the general engineer-ing industry.71.   It was also argued before us on behalf of the N.U.R. that the existing wage rates did not offer sufficient incentive or reward for workers in the grades calling for higher degrees of skill and responsibility.     It was not within our terms ofreference to attempt to carry out such full-scale investigation into the railway wages structure as would be necessary to enable us to express a concluded view/ on this
on this contention.     V/e feel, however,  in the light of the figures placed before us, both by the Union with regard to wage rates, and by the commission with regard to average earnings, that there is some substance in it.     In thisconnection account must particularly be taken of the Railway Staff NationalTribunal1 a Award No. 16 of November, 1954, v/hich gave increases to adultlocomotive staff ranging from 2s. 6d. to 263. and was accepted by all theparties concerned.     It was all those considerations which led us to the view expressed in paragraph 12 of our Interim Report and paragraph 7 of the Summaryof Conclusions in favour of &quot;a critical re-examination of all wage rates for conciliation staff covered by the Agreement of 8th October,  1954&quot;.    -/2.   There in now no need for un to expand further our reasons for recommending a resumption of negotiations between the parties, which has,  in fact, takenplace since t he publication of our Interim Report, or to deal further with paragraph 8 of the Summary of Conclusions.     What we have set out above states,in fuller measure than was possible in the urgent circumstances surrounding thepreparation and issue of our Interim Report, the basis of our findings and conclusions relating to this particular dispute.Efficiency and Economy73.   But before parting with our reference we desire to make certainobservations on matters relating to improvements in the economy and efficiency of working that were brought forward by the parties in the course of the inquiry before us.   Yire feel it within our competence to deal with them though they are not immediately germane to the immediate question of wages, because any economies and improvements in working that may be achieved in the future would presumably take some time to bring into operation and still longer for theireffects to be felt in the Revenue and expenditure accounts of the railways andRo on the amount of v/ages that oould be afforded in t erm3 of the solvency of theCommission.74--   It was not denied by Mr. Mien or Mr. Campbell that there is room forfurther economies and further improvements in the provision of services, in themethods of charging, in re-equipment of the undertaking and in methods of operation; nor was it claimed that the problems of over-staffing pr of restrictive practices had been wholly or satisfactorily solved.   Indeed,Xr. Campbell admitted a laok of enthusiasm on the part of his members foroo**operation to improve productivity so long as what they r egarded as their justolaims wore not met.   Further, the history of the discussions and disputesover railway v/ages during the past 18 months has been unhappy, involving ;as ithas done no less than two threats of a major stoppage in an industry v/hich has been free from such stoppages for 35 years (with the exception of participation in the General Strike of 1926).75.   Whether the sources of friction lie solely in failures in labour relations and in misunderstandings arising out of the unfortunate presentation of argumentsor whether they are combined with more fundamental and substantial causes of dispute, we cannot positively paocseesjbut we think it is plain that over thisperiod at least the relations between the Commission and the N.U.R. have beenolouded by imperfect understanding, while ether admitted facts to which we havemade general reference may be symptomatio of deeper administrative difficulties and disagreements which have not yet been met and overcome.I&apos; 76.   The present position is unhappy, and it seems that the elucidation andI solution ofsuoh difficulties and disagreements call for a much more searchingI and detailed inquiry than would have been possible for us in the light of thoH oxtraordinary circumstances in which v/e v/ere called upon to act.77.   Wo cannot conclude this report without placing on record our high apprecia-tion of the admirable services rendered to us in the whole course of our inquiry and the preparation of our reports by our Secretary and AssistantSeoretary, whose care and assistance have been of the very highest, value.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your Obedient Servants,(Sgd) JOHN CAMERON (Chairman).COLIN S.
