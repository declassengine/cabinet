Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1955SECRET Copy No.C. (55) 328th February, 1955CABINETNAVAL NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME 1955-56Memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyMy proposals for the Naval New Construction Programme for 1955-56 are set out below.PART I.-CONVENTIONAL SHIPS2. The first part deals with vessels of existing design armed withconventional weapons; this programme is as follows:  2 Fast Fleet Escorts.3 First Rate Anti-Submarine (A/S) Frigates.1 Anti-Aircraft (A/A) Frigate.4 General Purpose Frigates.10 Coastal Minesweepers.3 &quot; X &quot; Craft (or Midget Submarines).4 Fast Patrol Boats.2 Boom Defence Vessels.1 Ocean Tug.1 Cable Ship.3. It is becoming increasingly urgent to make provision for modern ships toreplace those older vessels which are rapidly becoming worn out and incapable of fighting under modern conditions. A review of the reserve fleet and theknown poor state of some of the ships have emphasised that a replacementprogramme must be commenced without further delay if the fleet is to be capableof achieving both its peace and war tasks.4. Not all the vessels listed in paragraph 2 will be laid down during thecoming financial year but some expenditure will be incurred on each of them formachinery and/or equipment.5. In addition, the programme includes a number of miscellaneous vessels,such as craft for use in amphibious operations, for dockyard and naval servicingpurposes, and motor boats for the fleet.6.  A few of the ships listed above need a word of explanation:  Fast Fleet EscortsThese will be the up-to-date version of the destroyer.MinesweepersThese will not be.laid down until 1956, although a great deal of preliminary work will occur in 1955-56.   The number included in the programme and the timing of the work on them is calculated, in accordance with the discretion given47623 b
to me by the Cabinet (C.C. (54) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 1) to mitigate the effect in the small shipyards of the recent decision to reduce the minesweeper programme as a whole.Cable ShipThis is needed to augment the numbers of this type of ship, which will berequired to lay the anti-submarine detection devices and navigational aidequipments which are being developed.Finance7. The estimated cost of the programme described in Part I is  41,137,000spread over five years, although the figure at this stage is necessarily very tentative.Miscellaneous vessels are reckoned to cost an additional  3,391,000. An analysis of these figures is in Table I of Appendix I.8. I take this opportunity to ask also for covering approval of the relics ofthe new construction programme for 1952-53, 1953-54 and 1954-55. These havebeen under such constant adjustment as a result of successive reviews of defence policy that it would have been premature to have sought formal approval at anyearlier date. Details of the present state of these programmes, which have been severely truncated with the passage of time, are given in Appendix I. Work onmost of the vessels has with Treasury concurrence already been started. Table IIshows the estimated cost of all the ships and craft included in these programmes.PART II.-GUIDED WEAPONS SHIPS9. As the chart at Appendix II shows, our cruiser fleet is ageing rapidly.In spite of the decision to complete the 3 Tigers, by 1962 our total cruiser strengthwill be down to 14 as compared with the present figure of 23, and by 1965 it willbe reduced to 7. In order to arrest this process of decay, a programme of new construction of a class of ship designed to replace the present type of cruiser mustbe started as soon as possible. In the Admiralty&apos;s view, this new class should be armed with guided weapons.10. The time has now come in the development of the guided weapon andits associated equipment when the Admiralty feel confident that they can proceedwith the design and eventual construction of an operational vessel to carry this new and revolutionary weapon. The guided weapon will,.we believe, effect a revolution in certain types of naval warfare which is comparable to the changeonce brought about by the introduction of the Dreadnought.11. In its first application the guided weapon will be a purely ship-to-airweapon.. It is planned to develop the system to be capable of operating a ship-to-ship weapon from the same equipment, but this latter application lies some years ahead.12. At first the guided weapon ship will have a dual armament consistingof a ship-to-air guided weapon system of great lethality which will imensely improve our ability to defend ourselves against air attack even though it be made by themost modern fast aircraft, and a modern gun armament for surface, anti-aircraft fire and bombardment. The ship will be so designed that this gun armamentcan be replaced by the ship-to-ship guided weapon system when this is available;and with this in mind we have deliberately limited the size of the ship to that required for the eventual fitting of the guided weapon armament and havecomplemented her with guns that are convenient for a ship of such size.13. These ships will be of the order of 11,000 tons. &apos; The present tentativeestimate of cost is about  1.1 million a ship, which would be spread over 6 to 7years.14. It is too early at present to- say how many of this class of ship will be needed, and further study will be given to this during the next few months. Whatis required now is authority to proceed with the preparation of a detailed design,with the intention of placing orders as soon as the design work has made sufficientprogress. At this stage I shall consult my colleagues again.
Conclusion15.   I accordingly seek:(a) approval for the New Construction Programme for 1955-56 given inParti;(b) covering approval for the New Construction Programmes for 1952-53,1953-54 and 1954-55 set out in Appendix I;(c) approval for the proposals concerning guided weapon ships set out inPart II.J.
