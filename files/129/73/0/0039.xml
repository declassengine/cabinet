Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955CONFIDENTIALC. (55) 3912th February, 1955CABINETTRANSATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLEMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Commercial Cable Company of America (C.C.C.) want to lay a- newtransatlantic telegraph cable following the route U.S.A., Nova Scotia,Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland. The cable would give 120 telegraphcircuits. It would cost them about $25 millions of which about $17 millions would be spent in this country on cable and repeaters.2. The probable but undisclosed object of the proposal is to put the C.C.C.in a dominant position as regards transatlantic telegraph traffic in relation toother American external telegraph carriers and to ourselves. The United StatesChiefs of Staff have, however, expressed the opinion that the cable has a definitepotential strategic value; our own Chiefs of Staff have endorsed this view andundertaken that account will be taken of it. There is no backing from the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.3. There are already telegraph cables between this country and the U.S.A.which are owned, and worked at both ends, by two American companies, one ofwhich is the C.C.C.; the licences of these companies to operate here are time-expired. We have limited cable capacity to Canada, but none to the U.S.A. in collaboration with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the canadians we are putting in a new transatlantic telephone cable which should be working by the end of next year. Although primarily a telephone cable this willalso give us more telegraph channels to Canada and, if the United StatesGovernment would agree, some to the U.S.A. also. Any chance of using the newtelephone cable for telegraphs to the U.S.A. would be lost if the proposed C.C.C.cable were laid.4. Our present telegraph service to the U.S.A. is by radio which is not reallycompetitive with the American cable system. It is partly because we cannot as yet give such good service, and partly for political reasons, that we have notterminated the time-expired licences of the American companies to operate here.The political reasons are likely to be valid for some time, but clearly we do not want to strengthen the position of the foreign companies. The proposed telegraphcable would do just that for the C.C.C. We should lose any opportunity tonegotiate for a greater share of the transatlantic telegraph traffic. We shouldhave to continue to rely on radio, or to lease American owned circuits, and might even be finally forced right out of the U.S.A. telegraph business. We shouldimperil our present small profit on this service and forgo the possibility of earning a net annual profit for the sterling area as a whole of about million.This would be forthcoming if the American carriers ceased their operations in theUnited Kingdom and we had a half share with the Americans in a moderntransatlantic telegraph system such as could be provided over our telephonecable/.5.   We have to consult our Commonwealth Partners in the CommonwealthCommunication System before granting any new concessions and they are not47654Copy No.
Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1.11th February, 1955.likely to react very favourably to the C.C.C. proposal. The Canadian Governmenthave not yet replied formally to the proposal, but I understand that they will onlycountenance the cable if limited to defence and commercial use by Canada only.6. Iceland has no commercial need for the cable. Denmark is unlikely toagree except on conditions unacceptable to the C.C.C.7. Apart from the defence aspect, therefore, there is a clear case for rejecting the proposal. But before doing this we must test the defence.requirement and Iseek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the following message being sent to the UnitedStates Government; the Canadian Government have no objection to such a message being sent.&quot; Proposals have been put to Her Majesty&apos;s Government for a cablesystem between the United States, Canada, Greenland, Iceland and the UnitedKingdom which, it is understood, would provide for defence needs. her majesty&apos;s Government have, of course, no desire to stand in the way of theprovision of a new cable if it is essential to defence, but the proposal, as put to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, incorporates advance under-writing by theAmerican Government of a substantial part of the commercial risks of aprivate venture which, for the rest, depends upon the diversion of traffic fromthe existing facilities in a competitive situation which is already very favourable to the American companies. Her Majesty&apos;s Government regret,that in these circumstances, they cannot as at present advised see their wayto permitting the projected cable to be used for purposes other than defence.Before informing the Commercial Cable Company accordingly they wouldbe glad to have any further observations that the American Government may.wish to offer.&quot;.
