Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1955SECRET Copy No.C. (55) 310th January, 1955CABINETPARTY POLITICAL BROAD CASTING IN wales memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe National Broadcasting Council for Wales, which was set up under theB.B.C. Charter, say they propose to allow time in the Welsh Home Service forparty political broadcasts on Welsh affairs. Their idea is that each Party whichput up a minimum of three candidates at the last General Election should nominatespeakers to broadcast for 15 minutes every six months. They would deal withWelsh affairs only, that is matters which can be discussed in the Welsh Debate inthe House of Commons, not excluding questions which would involve legislation.The Council have acted on their own initiative without reference to me, as theyare entitled to do.2. Under Clause 12 (4) (a) of the B.B.C. Charter it is the Councils duty tocontrol &quot; the policy and the content of the programmes of that service .... whichthe Corporation provides primarily for reception in the country for which theCouncil are established, and exercising such control with full regard to the distinctive culture, interests and tastes of ... . that country.&quot; The B.B.C. takethe view that it is not unreasonable for the Council to want some political broadcasts on purely Welsh affairs in view of their duties under the Charter.3. The B.B.C. are certain the Council would not drop their scheme as a resultof any informal pressure even if they were told that, should they not withdraw, Iwould issue a formal ban under Clause 15 (4) of the B.B.C. Licence. They say alsothat the whole of the Welsh Council would resign if such a ban were imposed.4. The Councils proposal would, I understand, mean that the Conservative,Labour, Liberal and Welsh Nationalist Parties would each have a quarter of an hour every six months. This arrangement, with the present distribution of WelshMembers in Parliament, would of course actually favour us as against the Labou&apos;-PaTty. It would, however, bring in the Welsh Nationalist Party and would thusintroduce a specially dangerous precedent.5. The Council&apos;s proposal, even if it were restricted to Parties having three or more Members of Parliament (as distinct from candidates) would introduce a serious precedent which might be followed in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Incidentally, even if the initial arrangements were quite unobjectionable theNational Councils might well want to change them later and for something reallyobjectionable. In fact this proposal means that a regional Council would have more control over party political broadcasting in its area than is at Dresent exercised by the B.B.C. nationally.6. On the other hand, there is strong feeling in Wales on this subject andthere is a virtual certainty of a serious political blow-up if the present proposals is banned.7.   Whatever view we may adopt, we should presumably have to consult the Opposition and possibly the Liberal Party.   I gather that the Welsh sectionsof the various Parties have not consulted their Headquarters, but that at a national level the Labour Party is likely to be as disturbed by the proposal as we are.47457
Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,6th January, 1955&apos;.8. A ban could be imposed either by direction by me to the BiB:C. underSection 15 (4) of their Licence, or by altering the B.B.C. Charter with the authorityof the whole of Parliament. The B.B.C. has no power to direct the Council onthis point.9. I have delayed circulating this paper until I could discuss the matter with both the B.B.C. and Lord Macdonald, Chairman of the Welsh Council. LordMacdonald has now agreed that the Council will not take a final decision at its next meeting, and that he would be prepared to discuss the question with party leaders early in February.
