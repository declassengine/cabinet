W01.17th February, 1955,British Embassy,Washington, DQ C14th  February,1955,Dear Secretary of State,Before you leave for Bangkok and meet Foster Dulles you maylike to have some reflections on the situation as I see it here0Formosa Straits,   There is not much to add to my numeroustelegrams,     I have little doubt that if the Communists slackened the linefor a moment, the Americans would be glad to wriggle off the hook of theoff&quot;-shore islands.    The change in public opinion about the Chinesequestion to which I first drew your attention in my letter of 5th november was continued in spite of the shocks administered by the Communistsover the prisoners and U, N, action,.    If you can find time to readSection 3 of our latest Weekly Summary (my telegram No0 99 Saving) youwill find evidence for this,    But we cannot force the pace.    It is largely a question of timing,     If the Chinese Communists proceed immediately to mount on attack on the Matsus or on Ciuemoy, than I think the disposition of the President will be to help the Nationalists resist the attack.    The President, for all the moderating influence which he has soskilfully exercised to calm American public opinion, is pretty firm, andwill be influenced by the &quot;psychological factors&quot; which Dulles mentionedrecently; the reluctance to go on retreating in the face of Communist
4-Hthreats, and the need to maintain the morale of the Nationalists0    Thereis also the position of Japan, which cannot be far from American thoughts,I have the impression that the President may be rather firmer in his attitude about the cff-shore islands than Dulles.In these circumstances I think it would be a pity to press theA-mericans harder than we have already done to define their policy more closely now0    They have been left in no doubt as to where we stazid.We ought to play for time if we can, because it is working in our favcur0The Americans are groping towards the concept of &quot;two Chinas&quot; or rather recognition of Peking and of a separate regime in Formosa,But there are many obstacles in their way.One is the domestic political scene, but this is no longercontrolling,,    Knowland is bound to come out against the President, notonly from conviction, but with his eye on 1956, though he has not got anysubstantial support in the country.    Nevertheless the President may need time to prepare the ground for a fight.It follows that we are unlikely to be able to bring the americans to a conference at the moment, though it might be possible later on,Perhaps the suggestion that two or three members of the security council should be asked to make an attempt at conciliation might keepthe ball in play.    But I do not think we ought to press this idea unlessthe Americans are willing to accept it,I expect that we may have to help the Americans out of their difficulties and I wonder whether ve could not give some public support to the position that Formosa should remain in friendly hands, and declare that we would regard an attack on it as an act of aggression until its future was determined by Uc N, action or other peaceful means0     this might not only help to bring the Americans towards our view on theoff-shore islands - but also dispose them to be more forthcoming ifHong Kong is threatened;, which in view of the present trend of Communistpolicy, appears possible,,     This must be giving you concern,,    Hong Kongto an Americans can be regarded as an off-shore island position,, and wecannot assume that they will inevitably come to our assistance if weare attacked,S0E,AcToO.   Events in Moscow and the apparent trend of Chinesepolicy will, I think, dispose the Americans to put more stuffing into theS.EoA,T0 Organisation.;,    They were, as you know, lukewarm at thebeginning, but events., combined with the pressure put on them by all theother participants (except ourselves) have moved them, and I think theymight be prepared to consider giving a fairly strong commitment for thedefence of South-East Asia., though this would be limited to air and navalsupport.    They may also bring themselves to re-consider the size oftheir economic aida    However, here again, they may need some encourage-ment through an offer by us,    I know that this is difficult, but Australia,and New Zealand have now accepted a commitment.    Could not we, forexample, offer to enlarge the police college in Malaya and give facilitiesfor training in jungle warfare to the S,E0A.T,O. countries?You will find Dulles anxious about Communist intentions in east and West,    The intelligence, as you know, is disquieting, road and rail construction on the Burmese frontier; Viet Minh  activity in
4-11 ANorthern Laos;  clandestine penetration into Vietnam; and there is alsothe road and airfield development on the Chinese coast to the north of formosa,    All this makes the Americans very wary of further negotiation and concession.As for the Soviet Union, there is the school of thought that theRussians are no longer trying to hold the Chinese back, but may egg them on, and promise them larger supplies of armaments and industrial goods0The CIoA. are more concerned than the State Department by Russianintentions, and it is they who advise the National Security Council,My best wishes for your trip,    I am only sorry you have felt obliged to curtail it.

For the last three weeks I have been wanting to write to you. Your most kind letter of February 10 lias reached me and I find that much I had already put on paper still represents my steadily growing llienie.Anthony and I, who have composed this message together, wish to do our utmost to sustain you and help you lead world opinion.

efforts you have made to keep out of war with China in spite of gross provocation.As you know, I feel strongly that it is a matter of honour for the United Statesnot to allow Chiang Kai-shek and his adherents, with whom the United Slateshave worked as Allies for so many years, to be liquidated and massacred by communist China, who are alleged to have already executed in cold blood between two and three millions of their opponents in their civil war. Our feeling is thatthis is the prime and vital point. According to our lights we feel that this could and should be disentangled from holding the olf-shore islands as bridgeheads fora Nationalist invasion of. Communist China. Besides this we do not think that formosa itself, while protected by the United Stales, ought to wage sporadic war against (he mainland.2. So the problem before us at this stage centres on what should be done about the off-shore islands, which we here have to admit are legally part of Chinaand which nobody here considers a just cause of war. You know how hardAnthony and I have tried lo keep in step with you and how much we wish tocontinue to do so. Rut a war to keep the coastal islands lor Chiang would notbe defensible here.3. I had understood that the United States Government had so far been resolved lo resist Chiangs pressure to give assurances about these islands, evenin return for Chinese Nationalist evacuation of the Tachens, and had succeeded,in doing so.   I hope your last sentence on page 2 does not conflict with this.4. I cannot see any decisive relationship, between the ofT-shorc islands andail invasion of Formosa. Il would surely be quite easy for the United Slates lodrown any Chinese would-be invaders of, Formosa whether they, started fromQuemoy or elsewhere. If ever there was an operation which may be deemedimpossible it would be the passage of about a hundred miles of sea in the teethof overwhelming naval and air superiority and without any tank and other speciallanding-craft. You and I have already studied and indeed lived through sucha problem both ways.5. Guessing at the other side&apos;s intentions is, as you say, often difficult. Inthis case of Quemoy, &amp;c, (he Communists have an obvious national and militarypurpose, namely, to get rid of a bridgehead admirably suited to the invasion ofthe mainland of China. This seems,simple.,6. Diplomatically their motives are more fanciful. Il may be, as,your, third paragraph suggests,&apos; that the absurd Chinese boastings about ^iivading Formosaare inspired by the Soviet desire to caiise division: between ,lhe Allies in,the far more important issues Which confront, us in Europe, It costs, very little to say,as the Chinese are now reported lo&apos;be doing, that &quot; the possession of,the Tachenswill help the liberation of Formosa.&quot; It adds to the pretence of Communist China smight and is intended to provoke the United States into actions and .declarationswhich would embarrass many of us, and add influence to Communist propaganda.
7. I have already expressed my convictions about your duly lo Chiang whomyou rightly called your &quot; brave Ally.&quot; I3ut 1 do not think it would be right or&quot;&apos;wise for America to encourage him lo keep alive the reconquesl of I lie mainlandin order lo enspirit iiis faithful followers. He deserves the protection of yourshield but not the use of your sword. (&quot; Sword &quot; in this case is a rather conipre-hensivc term.) The hope of Chiang subduing Communist China surely died six years ago when Truman, on MarshalTs advice, gave up llic struggle on the mainlandandmelpcd Chiang inlo the slicker of Formosa.8. We were of course glad lo see your decision, now bloodlessly carried out,lo evacuate the Tachen Islands, bul we slill feel very anxious aboul what mayhappen at-/the. Malsus and1 Quemoy. The operation of evacuating 50,000Nationalist troops might present serious dangers, especially lo the rearguard. Onthe other hand lo linger on indefinitely in the present uncertainly, might weli reach the same conclusion by a slower process.9. Before I got your message f had been wondering whether the followingIhree-fold policy would be acceptable and 1 send il now for your consideration.(a) To defend Formosa and Ihe Pescadores as a declared resolve.(/;) To announce the United Slates intention lo evacuate all the olf-shoreislands including Qucinoy in llie same way as llie Tacliens, and to declare that they will do this, al their convenience within (say) threemonths.(c) To intimate also by whatever channel or method is thought best (hat theUnited Slates will treal any proved major attempt to hamper thiswithdrawal as justification for using whatever conventional force isrequired.This would avoid Ihe unbearable situation of your overwhelming forces having to look on while Chiang&apos;s 50,000 men on Quenioy and any other detachmentelsewhere on the olf-shore coastline were being scuppered. To me at this distancellie plan seems lo have the merit of being simple, clear, and above all resolute.Il would I believe command a linn majority of support over here. It puts an endio a stale of affairs where unforeseeable or unprevenlable incidents and growingexasperation may bring aboul very grave consequences.10. To sum up, we feel that the coastal islands musl not be used as steppingsloncs cither by llie Communists towards the conquest of Formosa or the nationalists towards the conquest of China. I3ul they might all loo easily become the occasion of an incident which would place the United Slates before the dilemmaof either standing by while (heir allies were butchered or becoming embroiledin a war for no strategic or political purpose.11. If this is so, the right course must be to make sure that the United states are not put in the position of having lo make such a decision over the coaslal

If this is so, the right course must be to make sure that the United states are not put in the position of having lo make such a decision over the coastal
HISislands. This can only be done by taking advantage of the present lull to remove the Nationalists from Quemoy and the Matsus as they have already been removed from the Tachens before they become the occasion of further dangers. opinion in this country, and so far as can be judged in the Commonwealth, would regardsuch a decision as right in law, in morals and in worldly wisdom.12. Our long friendship made me wish to put these thoughts before you and now T have the generous invitation of your closing paragraph. Anthony..and Ideeply desire to do our utmost to help you and our strongest resolve is to keepour two countries bound together in their sacred brotherhood.With my kindest regards,Your sincere friend,Winston.
