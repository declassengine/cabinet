1%secret,(.S5) 19 COPY NO.^tA24th January,1955CABINETRAILWAY WAGES dispute memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour and National ServiceMy colleagues will already have seen the Final Report of theCourt of Inquiry into the railway wages dispute, which was circulated on21st January (C, (55) 18)0    In my view it is a good Report which goes far to deal successfully with many of ths difficulties which arose from theCourt&apos;s necessarily abbreviated Interim Report.    Its main conclusions are as follows -Criticisms of the Parties2. In commenting on the course of negotiations the Court condemnthe &quot;extraordinary conduct&quot; of the National Union of Railwaymen (N0U.R0)in(a) repudiating a ratified and operative agreement;(b) stipulating that negotiations could only proceed as a continuation of their 1953 claim;(c) insisting on a prior assurance of substantial concessions\ before negotiations had even begun.3. Nevertheless, the Court find a partial explanation of thisconduct in the &quot;exasperation and sense of frustration engendered by thenature of the replies made by the Commission to the N, U. R&apos;s claims forincreased wages&quot;.    The British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) iscriticised for admitting at one time that railwaymen were underpaid, butarguing that the Commission could not afford to pay them more, and atanother time arguing that railwaymen were adequately paid.    The Courtfind the crux of the dispute in the deadlock resulting from the use ofarguments which they describe as &quot;mutually contradictory&quot; (paragraph 59).Fair Wages4j, The Court re-state and elaborate (paragraphs 60-68) the remarksabout &quot;fair wages&quot; which they previously made in paragraph 10 of theirInterim Report.    They emphasise that to be a &quot;fair wage&quot; it must notonly be no lower than it should be but also no higher than it should be.They also point out that the right to receive a fair and adequate wageimplies that the wage must be properly earned - &quot;it is fundamental thatthe employer is entitled to expect, and the employee is bound to give,a fair dayls work for a fair day&apos;s wage&quot; (paragraph 64).    Where, as in
the case of the B, T. C. , many of the normal factors determining wage rates are absent, it is necessary to fall back on the expedient of relating wages to those paid in such comparable industries as may be found.    The Courtfurther stress that in such circumstances both employee and employeralike have a special obligation to promote efficiency and productivity,and that it would be wrong for the industry to be called upon to carryredundant staff.5. These clarifications and especially the references to efficiency and economy meet the most general criticisms of the Court&apos;s views onfair wages as expressed in paragraph 10 of their Interim Report.    Ipropose to draft, in consultation with my colleagues concerned, a statement in suitable terms of the Governments attitude to this particular matter.This statement would be included in any pronouncement to be made onbehalf of the Government in the course of the proposed debate on thevarious matters which arise out of the recent dispute and the Court ofhiquiry&apos;s Reports thereon.Financial position,.......6. The Court examine in some detail considerations arising fromthe financial obligation   of the Commission under the Transport Act, 1947,which requires the Commission to balance revenue with expenditure &quot;takingone year with another&quot;.    In the light of the statements and actions of theCommission itself, the Court reach the conclusion that the Commission^statutory obligation does not &quot;by itself operate as a bar to the paymentof what may be determined to be adequate and proper wag*s for efficientservice, unless a situation has been reached where the imposition offurther burdens of expenditure make the ultimate achievement of theCommission^ statutory duty over their chosen period of years animpossibility&quot; (paragraph 55).    The Court then quote extensively from theCommission^ written evidence on their future financial prospects(paragraphs 57 and 58).    Drawing particular attention to the Commission^views that increased charges not only must be fully justified but also canonly be made within the limits imposed by competition and that &quot;a substantialdeficit is likely to remain, which must be met by the public somehow,since the Commission has no reserves&quot;, the Court remark (paragraph 68)that it is not within their reference to investigate the sources from which any necessary wage increases are to be financed,*7. As the Court point out (paragraph 73) some financial benefitcan be expected to accrue in the long run from future economies and improved efficiency, but the Government will be expected to state what measures are contemplated now to deal with the immediate financialposition.    This aspect of the problem is, I understand, under considera-tion by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport and civil Aviation.Efficiency and Economy8, The Court refer to the questions of surplus manpower (para-graph 65) and improvements in economy and efficiency (paragraph 67).    they point out (paragraph 74) that both sides agree that there is room forfurther economies and improvements in the provision of services, andthat it is not claimed that the problems of over-staffing or of restrictive practices have been wholly or satisfactorily solved.    The Court alsorefer (paragraph 75) to failures in labour relations and other causes of difficulty and disagreement between the Commission and the N.U.R.
t So9. The Report finally concludes (paragraph 76) with the suggestionthat there is need for a more searching and detailed enquiry into thesematters aAction Proposed10. The Government will be pressed for theii views on this report and for a statement of what action they propose to take to remedy the stateof affairs disclosed.    It is clearly important to obtain first the views ofthe Commission and of the Railway Unions.    The kind of action likely tobe successful is one that carries with it the B0T0C. and the Railway Unions.11. The Report is to be published on Tuesday, 25th January at 6 p0moand I propose to invite representatives of the Commission and of the railway unions to give me their views on the Report at meetings on Thursday,27th January.    I intend to take the opportunity to discuss with them theproposed enquiry amongst the other matters with which the Report deals,in so far as these concern my Department.12. I suggest that a final decision on these matters should be takenH.W.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1,22nd January, 1955.\
