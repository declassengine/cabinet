A PROGRAMME OF NUCLEAR power. An important stage has been reached in the development of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Hitherto the work in this country has con-sisted of a military programme, a broadly based research and development programme, and the production and use of radioisotopes. The militaryprogramme continues to be of great importance. But the peaceful applica-tions of nuclear energy now demand attention. Nuclear energy is the energyof the future. Although we are still only at the edge of knowledge of itspeaceful uses, we know enough to assess some of its possibilities.2. Our future as an industrial country depends both on the ability ofour scientists to discover the secrets cf nature and on our speed in applying the new techniques that science places within our grasp. The exact linesof future development in nuclear energy are uncertain, but this must notdeter us from pressing on with its practical application wherever it appearspromising. It is only by coming to grips with the problems of the design and building of nuclear power stations that British industry will acquire the experience necessary for the full exploitation of this new technology.3. The application that now appears practicable on a commercial scaleis the use of nuclear fission as a source of heat to drive electric generatingplant. This comes moreover at a time when the country&apos;s great and growing demand for energy, and especially electric power, is placing an increasingstrain on our supplies of coal and makes the search for supplementarysources of energy a matter of urgency. Technical developments hi nuclear energy are taking place so fast that no firm long-term programme canyet be drawn up. But if progress is to be made, some indication mustbe given of the probable lines of development so that the necessary prepara-tions can be made in good time. A large power station may take five or more years to complete, including finding the site, designing the station and building it. Some of the special materials needed for nuclear powermay take several years to get. Moreover, the main burden of building and designing commercial nuclear power stations will fall upon industrywho will have to see that the necessary staff are trained. These are some of the many things that must be started soon if we are not to wasteprecious years in building up this new and unfamiliar industry.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore prepared a provisional pro-gramme of nuclear power which covers the next ten years in some detail and gives an indication of the probable developments in the followingten years. It will be constantly modified as time goes on and at eachstage final decisions will not be taken until the last possible moment sothat new technical developments can be used to the fullest advantage.PART ITHE PROBABLE LINES OF DEVELOPMENT of nuclear POWER5. The principle of nuclear fission and the methods by which a nuclearreactor can be used in place of a coal or oil-fired furnace to provideheat for an electric generating plant have been described in variouspublications.*   A short account is given in Annex 1 which also describes* See particularly &quot;Harwell: The British Atomic Energy Research Establishment&quot;,London H.M.S.O., 1952: 6s. Od. and &quot; Britain&apos;s Atomic Factories&quot;, London H.M.S.O.,1954: 5s. Od.

The first type will be similar to &quot;those now being constructed at Calder Hall, but improvements in design during&apos;the period should enable1 the later-models to show &apos;a great advance-in ;efficiency compared with the earlier ones. They will be gas-cooled graphite-moderated &quot;thermal&quot; reactors using as fuel natural uranium or slightly&quot;enriched&quot; usanium, i.e. fuel having a slightly higher fissile content thannatural uranium. The first improved models could be designed and builtso as to come into operation in about six years&apos; time.7. These first reactors will burn only a very small proportion of thenatural uranium placed in. them but they will produce, in addition to heat,the new element plutonium which does not appear in nature. This plutoniumwhich can be extracted chemically from the used fuel is potentially very valuable: it is a&apos;.&apos;pure fissile material whereas natural uranium containsonly brie part, in 140 of fissile material.8. The second type of reactor that may be built for commercial operationduring the next ten years is a liquid-cooled &quot; thermal&quot; reactor. this type requires more complicated techniques which at present would resultin higher costs. But with further development liquid-cooled reactors shouldbe able to give a much higher heat rating* than the first gas-cooled reactorsfor the same capital cost. They might therefore eventually prove more economic than the gas-cooled reactors although the comparison will dependon how much the gas-cooled type can be improved. They could take any of several forms (see Annex 1) most of which need &quot; enriched&quot; fuel and could use for this purpose the plutonium produced in the earlier reactorsin conjunction with natural uranium. The first commercial liquid-cooledreactors might be built during the latter part of the next ten years andbegin operating about 1965.9. Development after 1965 may take various forms: thorium may beused, at first in conjunction with plutonium, as an alternative fuel; &quot;homo-&quot; geneous &quot; and &quot; fast breeder &quot; reactors may be developed. It has alreadybeen decided to build a full-scale experimental model of a &quot;fast breeder&apos;&quot;&quot;reactor capable of producing power ori a site at Dounreay in Caithness.-There is no doubt that the commercial reactor that emerges after these developments as.,the:.most, suitable, whatever, type it may be, will. have, ;alovifer, capital ,cost per kilowatt and a better utilisation of the nuclear: fuel,than any ot.tbeearlier reactors..&apos;.&apos;. . ... &quot;&apos;-sfh i&apos;i i&apos;i;o x*? iy.Wi!&apos;&apos;;v.&apos; &apos;*\vu;o;.7dc) %r tfcrfuti fin? ,w*t?Q8db?$J3o .33%b3rtfi(i..!.^&apos;,Tbe,J)eat rating ofa, reactor ,is Ae, rate, of production of heat fcbnieach t,bri of fiietin tiiev!;reactor. .wlr
PART II* The load factor of a station is the ratio of the average load to the peak load carried by thestation in each year. The stations having the lowest running costs are operated on the &quot; baseload &quot; (i.e., they are used to supply the demand that is present the whole time) and therefore have a high load factor.30728a?10. An estimate can be made of the cost of electricity produced by thetwo types of reactor likely to be in commercial use in the next ten yearsalthough it must be subject to a wide margin of uncertainty. Experience of operating reactors at high temperatures and under the high rates of heatextraction required for power is still limited. To the technical uncertaintiesabout the characteristics and performance of the reactors themselves mustbe added the rather different uncertainties about the supply and value of the nuclear materials required by and produced by a reactor system. In whatfollows the results of making assumptions on these counts should be regardedas giving only an approximate and not an exact estimate of cost.Capital and Overhead Costs11. A reasonably accurate estimate of the constructional cost of the firstcommercial stations can be made. A station of the same type, but designedto produce fissile material for military purposes as well as electricity, isalready being built at Calder Hall at a cost of  15- 20 million. Even thefirst commercial reactors of the Calder Hall type can be expected to showa higher heat rating than those now under construction, so that the capital cost for each kilowatt installed will be lower. A new station might havean electrical output of 100-150 megawatts or even 200 megawatts. We haveno experience on which to base an estimate of the working life of a reactorin a commercial station but a life of between 10 and 20 years seems to be areasonable technical assumption. As nuclear stations will have a highercapital cost and a lower running cost than other stations, they will be runas base-load stations at a high load factor (perhaps 80 per cent).* On these assumptions a rough figure for the annual overhead cost for each unit of output can be calculated. The works and operating costs, excluding fuelcosts, can be estimated from the experience of operating coal-fired power stations and the military reactors at wind scale.12. Developments in reactor design such as the introduction of liquidcooling should gradually lead to much higher heat ratings without muchincrease in capital cost. This would reduce still further the capital cost foreach kilowatt installed, and thus reduce the annual overheads.Fuel Costs13. The fuel cost depends on three things: the cost of the raw material,uranium ore ; the\processing cost, including the conversion of ore into fabri-cated fuel elements, the chemical processing of the used fuel elements andthe extraction of plutonium from them ; and the &quot; level of irradiation &quot;, thatis, the amount of heat that can be got from each ton of fuel in the reactorbefore it has to be taken out.14. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that enough uranium will beavailable for the civil programme over die next ten years, after making thebest assessment possible of world supplies and of world requirements for all purposes. The cost of the initial charge of fabricated uranium for one of theearly types of station similar to Calder Hall may amount to about  5 million ;
a new charge costing the same will be needed every 3-5 years. The cost ofprocessing uranium, both before and after use, is known from the processesnow being worked at the Springfields and wind scale factories for the militaryprogramme. In the early stages of a power programme the processing costs will be similar, but big reductions can be expected later when new factories are built.15. It is expected that it will be possible to extract as much as 3,000megawatt-days of heat from every metric tonne of fuel.* This is the equiva-lent of the heat from 10,000 tons of coal. There is as yet no practical experience of this level of irradiation at high temperatures and themetallurgical behaviour of the fuel elements is uncertain. But there are many lines of development which should overcome such metallurgical defectsas may appear.The Cost of Electricity and the Credit for the Plutonium By-product16. Some credit should be taken for the fissile by-product plutonium. Itis in many ways equivalent to uranium 235, another form of fissile material.But plutonium can be extracted by chemical means from a power reactor&apos;sused fuel for only a fraction of the cost of separating uranium 235 fromnatural uranium in a diffusion plant. When pure fissile material is availablein quantity there will be great scope for the design and development ofmore advanced and more efficient reactors that need &quot; enriched &quot; material and will not operate on natural uranium. For example, most types of liquid-cooled reactor need &quot; enriched &quot; material; and, looking further ahead, con-centrated fissile material in the form of either uranium 235 or plutonium isrequired for a &quot; fast&quot; reactor or for starting a thorium system. In this manner the early reactors will be producing not only electricity but also thecapital equipment (i.e. the initial charge of fissile material) for future power stations. Without the plutonium it would not be possible to build up asystem of nuclear power stations of steadily advancing efficiency.17. In the early stages of an expanding nuclear power programme it is tobe expected that pure fissile material will be scarce and that if there were a free market its price would be high. It will be required for enriching the fuel charge in new commercial reactors, and also for many experimental anddevelopment purposes including the fuelling of prototypes of advanced design.Eventually the system will reach the stage where more plutonium is pro-duced than the new power stations require; its &quot; market&quot; price will then falland it might be used as a substitute for natural uranium rather than asconcentrated fissile material.  This is unlikely to happen for 15 or 20 years.18. It ismot obvious what is the right value to put on the plutoniumproduced, although the effect on the net cost of electricity could be consider-able. A high value in the early stages of the programme means a lower netrunning cost for the early reactors but adds a heavier capital charge on tothe later ones, which they might well be able to afford because of theirhigher efficiency. Limits can be set to the value of the plutonium byconsidering the uses to which it might be put. At worst it could be fedback into a reactor as fuel in place of natural uranium; and since naturaluranium contains only one part in 140 of fissile material, plutonium shouldbe worth at least 140 times as much, weight for weight. At best plutoniumis not likely to be worth more than the cost of uranium 235 separated fromnatural uranium in a diffusion plant. There is a wide range between theselimits but both values can be measured in terms of thousands of poundssterling for a kilogram of plutonium.   In the early period it is thought right* See paragraph 8 of Annex 1.
to take credit for the plutonium at a rate of many thousands of pounds akilogram; this credit should eventually fall, but would still have a significant effort on the cost of generating electricity.19. On the assumptions set out above, and taking what appears to be areasonable credit value (being a high value but well below the cost ofseparated uranium 235) for the plutonium by-product, the cost of electricityfrom the first commercial nuclear stations comes to about 0-6d. a unit.This is about the same as the probable future cost of electricity generated bynew coal-fired power stations (see Annex 2 para. 10). If no credit were taken for the plutonium the cost of nuclear power would be substantially more than 0-6d. a unit. Later stations should show a great improvement inefficiency, but the value of plutonium would probably fall considerably during their lifetime and they would eventually have to take a much lower credit for it. Even so their higher efficiency should enable them to remaincompetitive with other power stations.20. These estimates assume that all the plutonium is used for civil purposes,as would be most desirable. No allowance has been made for any militarycredits.PART IIIA PROVISIONAL PROGRAMME21. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the development of nuclear power has reached a stage where it is vital that we should apply it commer-cially with all speed if we are to keep our position as a leading industrialnation and reap the benefits that it offers. The programme outlined belowis provisional and must be considered only as the best indication that cannow be given of the probable line of development. Types of stations,numbers and dates are all subject to change.22. Although the decision to go ahead with a nuclear power programmedoes not depend on precise comparisons of cost, the outline given abovehas shown that the cost of nuclear power should not be greatly different from the cost of power from coal-fired power stations. This country hasa rapidly growing demand for energy, particularly in the form of electric power, and increasing difficulty in producing the necessary quantities ofcoal. These facts by themselves would justify a great effort to build upa nuclear power system.23. The stations will be designed and built by private industry for theElectricity Authorities,* who will own and operate them. The atomic energy Authority, as the only body with the necessary experience, will beresponsible for giving technical advice on the nuclear plant. British industryand consulting engineers have as yet no comprehensive experience of nucleartechnology. They will be faced with a major task in training staff, in creating, the necessary organisation and in designing the stations. This work,has already begun. Owing to its complexity and diversity teams drawn from several firms may have to be formed. The preparatory work willcall for great efforts from all concerned, and even so it will not be practicable to start building any commercial stations before 1957. .* These are at present the British Electricity Authority, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the Northern Ireland Electricity Board. On 1st April 1955 the Southof Scotland Electricity Board will come into existence and the Central Electricity authority will replace the British Electricity Authority.5
&apos; 24. In this way it is intended that the Electricity; Authorities and private industry should obtain as quickly as possible the practical experience.irldesigning and building nuclear power stations-that will be the neqessaryfoundation for a big expansion in the later stages of the programme.-.: the atomic Energy&apos; Authority, while giving as much-assistance and-advice to industry as possible, will remain primarily a research and: development organisation and will continue to design, build and operate pioneering types of power reactor. They will also be responsible for buying uranium, faori-cating the fuel elements, processing the used fuel and. extracting-1 theplutonium from it. There will therefore have tp be. a continuous processOf co-operation and of financial adjustment between the Electricity andAtomic Energy Authorities; The : exact arrangements to be made are atpresent being discussed with them; ; 1Power Stations25. The provisional programme for the construction of nuclear power stations* is as follows : (i) The construction of two gas-cooled graphite-moderated stations (each with two reactors) would be started about mid-1957. These stationsshould come into operation in 1960-1961.(ii) The construction of two further stations would be started about18 months later, i.e. in 1958-1959. These would also have tworeactors each and would be similar \ in type to the earlier twostations but should show an improved performance, particularlyin heat rating. Each of the eight reactors in these early stations would have a net output of electricity of 50 to 100 megawatts sothat the total output from the four stations, which should all bein operation by 1963, would be somewhere between 400 and 800megawatts.(iii) These first four stations might be followed by four more stationsstarting perhaps in 1960, and then a further four starting 18 months later, say, 1961-1962. These might come into, operation in 1963-1964 and in 1965. It is difficult to specify what type of stationthese would be, but it is probable that each station would consistof only one reactor which would be much more highly ratedthan the reactors in the first four stations. The stations begun in 1960 might be developments of the gas-cooled graphite-moderatedtype. The last four stations might&apos; be of the liquid-cooled type which might by then have been developed sufficiently to be economically satisfactory. The total installed capacity of the eightstations in this group might amount to, say, 1,200 megawatts.26. The ten-year programme would.produce,an installed capacity of about1,500 to 2,000 megawatts by: the end of the period, and the capacity wouldbe growing rapidly.. The rate of growth at. the end. of. the, ten years wouldbe&apos; something like a quarter; of this country&apos;s annual requirement, for.newgenerating capacity, which- by then will probably be,, over 2.000 megawatj^a year,.

A new fuel processingand fabricating plant will be needed in due course to supplement the existingfactory at Springfields in satisfying the rapidly increasing demand for nuclearfuel; and a new chemical processing plant will eventually be needed to dealwith the large quantities of used fuel taken out of the nuclear power stations.Such slight enrichment as may be necessary for the fuel elements in theearly stations can be provided from the existing capacity of the diffusionplant at Capenhurst.Cost29. The capital expenditure on the construction and installation of the stations in the programme will be considerable. The cost of the first twostations together (comprising four reactors) would probably be between 30 million and  35 million. The next two stations which would have amuch higher output would cost perhaps slightly more, while the cost of thelast eight stations would be in the region of  125 million in total. The costof the initial charges of uranium, including fabrication, might amount to afurther  40 million. The new ancillary plant that would be required withinthe 10-year period might cost  30 million. The concurrent capital expendi-ture on prototype development might be  30 million to  40 million. Thecost of the ten-year programme might therefore come to  300 million. Therate of expenditure on the commercial applications of nuclear power would rise steadily during the period and the total over the ten years would amountto. more than this since it would include expenditure on stations that wouldnot be completed until after 1965 and do not appear in the present programme.30. This investment will not be a wholly additional demand on the economy.The nuclear power stations will be built instead of other types of station.The investment by the Electricity Authorities in new coal or oil-fired general-ing capacity over the next 10 years would, in the absence of nuclear power,probably be of the order of  1,200 million. With a nuclear power programmethere will be a significant reduction in this figure which can be set off againstthe investment in nuclear power. The National Coal Board should also beable to reduce its investment programme in some ten years time below whatwould have been necessary in the absence of nuclear, power.   , .: 31. No accurate assessment can be made so far ahead of the amount ofadditional investment that the economy will be able to afford. All that can,be-said is that; given a normal rate of growth of gross national-productand&apos; givfen that a reasonable proportion &apos; of the increase in resources washiade available&apos;for: ah increase in investment, there would not appear to beany1 great difficulty in-/accommodating a nuclear power- programme on thestale here proposed. It is unlikely that the rate- of expansion of investment in the fuel and power&apos;industries over- the next 10 years, even including this programme, will exceed the rate of the expansion in real terms that,hastaken place since 1948. .
Long-Term Prospect32. From about 1965 it may be economically desirable on grounds ofrelative cost to build nuclear power stations instead of coal-fired stations,even without taking account of any long-term difficulties in the supply ofcoal. Cheap power is a great asset to any industrial country and the more quickly we can convert power generation to the cheaper system the soonerwe can hope for a reduction in the real costs of production.33. On the provisional programme the new nuclear power stations wouldby 1965 be meeting a quarter of the total requirement of new generating capacity. How quickly it would be possible to expand the programme to match the whole of this requirement will depend upon the progress made in the first ten years. The programme for this first period may besubject to frequent and major change according to the speed of technical development and the success of the early stations. Any attempt to forecast the developments after 1965 must be even more uncertain.34. The possibilities of expansion will depend in the first place on whetherthe necessary techniques have been mastered by industry at large. the atomic Energy Authority will continue to make new information available and to provide training ; with this help industry should acquire wide ex-perience in carrying out a 10 year programme of the type that has been out-lined and this would make possible a much greater expansion after 1965. if all went well it might be practicable to expand the rate of construction of nuclear power stations to match our total requirement of new generating capacity by the early 1970s, which by this time might amount to about,000 megawatts a year. On this assumption the total nuclear power stationcapacity installed by the early 1970s would be of the order of 12,000 mega-watts, the whole of which could be used for base-load operation. the nuclear power stations would then be producing electricity at a rate equivalentto that produced by about 40 million tons of coal a year.35. Another possible limitation on the rate of expansion in the later years is the supply of nuclear fuel, particularly the more highly enrichedmaterial that will be needed for some of the advanced types of reactor.By the late 1960s the early reactors should be producing plutonium in quantity and this would be available for the later reactors. The provisional programme and the further expansion thereafter will also call for increased supplies of uranium ; and no doubt other countries will be increasing their commercial demands at the same time. Recent evidence suggests thaturanium is more plentiful than was once thought; considerable workabledeposits of medium-grade ore are known while the widespread existence of low-grade or;es implies that adequate quantities can be produced from them if necessary. Moreover the expansion in the requirement of uranium shouldbe mitigated by the greater economy in its use that will by then havebeen achieved and by the possible development of the substitute fuel thorium,which should be available in considerable quantities if it is required. Forthese reasons Her Majesty&apos;s Government are confident that the necessarysupplies of raw material will be available to meet the increases in demand.&apos;- .  \.yv    ,:rn pltf l- *&apos;T:0; r&apos;K)H \yi&apos;!yjt:-&apos;; .-. U!-ff&apos;l ^ndViliSiting and Safety36. The history of the development of nuclear energy has made everyoneaware of its destructive possibilities and it would be natural to ask whether there were any special dangers associated with nuclear power installations.The first important thing to recognise is that it is impossible for an &quot; atomic
explosion&quot; to take place in a power reactor. If nuclear power facilities are properly designed any accidents that may occur will be no more dangerous - than accidents in many other industries.37. The main hazards in a nuclear power station are caused by the con-centration of highly radioactive materials. But these are known dangers which can be guarded against, both by precautions in the design of thereactor itself and if necessary by enclosing some or all of it in a gas-tightcontainer. The reactors that will be built for the commercial productionof electricity will present no more danger to people living nearby thanmany existing industrial works that are sited within built-up areas. Never-theless the first stations, even though they will be of inherently safe design,will not be built in heavily built-up areas.38. The disposal of radioactive waste products should not present a. majordifficulty. The problem is primarily one for the chemical processing plants,which will be few in number, and not for the power stations. The volumeof waste will be small and great efforts are being made to determine themost economical methods of storing or disposing of it. There are manyvaluable uses for it which may be able to absorb a great part of theoutput. Any material that is discharged will be tested to ensure that itis of extremely low radioactivity, so that it will be harmless and comparablein effect to the natural background radioactivity which is always present.ij &apos;t;r..!jj.;K nui . -&apos; ,-. -.   ^ . i . - ^ y:. - &apos; ;.y,-:-\     -j -.   : a&apos;, *y-&apos;.International Aspects39. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have always been in favour of the greatest possible international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,so that full use can be made of this great new scientific development forthe benefit of the world. The Government have recently acted as jointsponsor for the proposal before the United Nations, which has now beenapproved, to set up an International Atomic Energy Agency and haveagreed to make available to the Agency 20 kilograms of fissile material.They intend to play a full part in the international scientific conferenceon the peaceful uses of nuclear energy that is to be held later this year.40. Physicists and engineers from a number of countries have taken theopportunity of learning nuclear technology by attending schools and courses in this country such as the Reactor and Isotopes Schools at Harwell. Sofar as resources permit we intend to provide further facilities for nationals of other countries to attend these schools. Other countries will also be helped to build experimental and development reactors which are an essential preliminary to the building of commercial reactors. We are already helpingin this way a number of Commonwealth and European countries.4.1. We must look forward also to the time when a valuable export tradecan be built up. The experience gained by British industry in designingand building nuclear power stations during the next ten years should laythe foundations for a rapid expansion both at home and overseas. At themoment nuclear power generation is still in the development phase ; the exact economics of nuclear power stations are uncertain; and the stationswhen built will still be pioneering projects and will need a lot of skilledattention. But as time goes on the design of the stations will be improved,the cost of electricity from the stations will be known more exactly and,above all, their construction and operation will have become standardengineering technique. We shall then be in a position to fulfil our traditionalrole as an exporter of skill, to the benefit both of ourselves and of therest of the world.
PART IV

THE PLACE OF THE PROGRAMME IN THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S FUEL POLICY

42. In a debate in the House of Commons on 9th July, 1954,* the Minister of Fuel and Power, in describing the fuel and power policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, said that one of its main objectives was to supplement supplies of coal with other kinds of energy-atomic energy as soon as possible and oil forthwith. The previous three Parts of this Paper have given an account of the possible development of nuclear power in this country so far as it can be foreseen now. They express the Government&apos;s hopes and views about the scale and timing of the commercial use of nuclear power. It can now be shown how this possible development would fit in with the energy requirements of this country and with the supply of other fuels.

Electricity

43. The use of electricity has grown rapidly in all countries ever since it was introduced commercially in the 1880s. The average increase has been about 7 per cent. a year which means that consumption has doubled every 10 years. This cannot be expected to go on for ever but so far there is no sign that the demand for electricity is even beginning to approach saturation point either in this country or anywhere else, even in countries with a much higher consumption a head than ours.

44. An estimate of the demand for electricity in Great Britain during the next 20 years is given in detail in Annex 2. The demand is expected to continue to grow rapidly although at a slower pace than before. It is likely to be some 31/2 times the present level in 20 years&apos; time. To meet this growth in demand, with the opportunity it will offer for higher productivity and efficiency throughout the economy, it is estimated that the installed generating capacity, which averaged 20,000 megawatts in 1954, will have to be increased to 35-40,000 megawatts by 1965 and to perhaps 55-60,000 megawatts by 1975. If the provisional programme suggested above were completed-in practice it is certain to be modified one way or the other-it would provide nearly 2,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 1965 and somewhere between 10 and 15,000 megawatts by 1975. But the nuclear power stations would be operated on base load and would supply a higher proportion of the total power than the ratio of these figures would suggest.

Coal Supplies

45. Without nuclear power the rate of consumption of coal (or its equivalent as oil) by the power stations alone would increase on the assumption in the last paragraph by perhaps 2½ times over the next 20 years, reaching about 65 million tons a year by 1965 and 100 million tons a year in the 1970s, and would at that time be rising by 4 or 5 million tons a year. On the basis of the provisional programme of nuclear power, the coal required by power stations would level off in the region of 60 to 70 million tons a year during the course of the 1960s. This levelling off in the demand for coal for power stations would come none too soon to help with the difficulties of finding manpower for the mines and of producing at reasonable cost enough coal for the users of solid fuel whose demand would have been steadily rising meanwhile.

* House of Commons Report. Vol. 529: Col. 145.
46. Since the war the production of coal from deep mines has increased from 175 million tons in 1945 to 214 million tons in 1954. But the demands of our expanding home industries have been rising even faster. We have had to supplement output from the deep mines by opencast coalmining and by importing coal, and even so supplies for the householder are still restricted and there is not enough for exports. The National Coal Board have in hand a large programme of capital investment which has gone ahead rapidly in the last year or two; but a great part of this will be needed to maintain the output of the mines at the present level. Greater efficiency in the use of coal and substitution of oil for coal in certain processes including electricity generation will give some limited relief but the increasing demand for fuel cannot be met without exploiting to the full any new and economic technique available.

 47. The provision of enough men for the mines is one of our most intractable problems and is likely to remain so. In order to meet the present demand for coal recourse has been had to voluntary Saturday working as well as to opencast production and to imports: but the demand continues to increase. Any relief that can come from other sources of energy such as nuclear power will do no more than ease the problem of finding and maintaining an adequate labour force. There can be no question of its creating redundancy. The mining industry will in any case remain one of the major employing industries of the country, but it may hope to be relieved by the advent of nuclear power of the excessive strains which are now being put upon it.

PART V

CONCLUSION

48. Our civilization is based on power. Improved living standards both in advanced industrial countries like our own and in the vast underdeveloped countries overseas can only come about through the increased use of power. The rate of increase required is so great that it will tax the existing resources of energy to the utmost. Whatever the immediate uncertainties, nuclear energy will in time be capable of producing power economically. Moreover it provides a source of energy potentially much greater than any that exist now. The coming of nuclear power therefore marks the beginning of a new era.

49. As a leading industrial nation our duty, both to ourselves and to other countries, is to establish this new industry of nuclear energy on a firm foundation and to develop it with all speed. It is a major industrial development that will bring with it revolutionary changes in technique. We shall only learn the new techniques by pressing forward with the practical applications wherever we can and in spite of the many uncertainties surrounding each enterprise.

50. The programme that is described here is provisional and will be altered in many ways in the course of time. But it is hoped that it gives a clear enough picture of the probable scale, scope and timing of developments to put nuclear power in its proper perspective and to show how it will fit in as one of the sources of energy that will be available to meet the rapidly growing needs of our expanding economy.
Stop51. The large-scale production of nuclear power cannot be brought aboutquickly. The first commercial, as opposed to experimental, stations willnot be in operation for at least five years. But if proper preparations aremade now it will be possible for nuclear power to be produced commerciallyin significant quantities within ten years. The experience gained frombuilding and operating stations during these ten years should make possible a much more rapid expansion thereafter at home and abroad.52. New technical developments that cannot at present be foreseen may perhaps lead to a more rapid improvement in the performance of stationsthan has been assumed. If so we should be in a good position to takeadvantage of such developments. On the other hand the provisional pro-gramme may turn out to be too optimistic : the stations may take longer to design and to build ; they may cost more; the amount of development workneeded may have been understimated. If any of these things happenednuclear power would come later or be more expensive than the programmesuggests.   The Government consider that these risks must be accepted.53. This formidable task must be tackled with vigour, imagination and.courage. We must not be put off by setbacks or uncertainties. The stakesare high but the final reward will be immeasurable. We must keep ourselves in the forefront of the development of nuclear power so that we can playour proper part in harnessing this new form of energy for the benefit of mankind.V
ANNEX 1The Nature of Nuclear Reactions1. Mankind relies at present on two main sources of energy:  (a) Chemical reactions (where energy is released mainly in the form ofheat derived from the burning in air of such organic substances aswood, coal, and oil),(b) naturally occurring movements of large masses of matter (winds, and water falling under gravity).The source of energy with which we are now concerned is fundamentallydifferent from these forms of energy, although they are all ultimately derivedfrom solar energy, which is itself a product of nuclear reactions taking placein the sun.2. The atoms of which matter is composed, of which there are about100 different kinds, are all constructed on the same pattern: they consistof a dense central nucleus which carries a positive charge and is surroundedby a field of negatively charged electrons. The nucleus itself is made upof positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. The number ofprotons, which equals the number of electrons, determines the chemicalproperties of the atom ; while the total number of the particles in the nucleus(protons and neutrons) determines its mass. A change in the number ofneutrons affects the mass of the atom but leaves its charge (and therefore itschemical nature) unaltered. Chemically identical atoms, that is, atoms havingthe same charge but different masses, are called isotopes. Uranium 235 anduranium 238 are different isotopes of the same chemical element uranium,the number after the name of the element indicating the mass of the atom, i.e.,the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Isotopes maybe stable or they may be radioactive, i.e., tending to change spontaneouslyinto other atoms or isotopes while at the same time emitting particles orradiation. A change in the number of protons, on the other hand, affects thecharge of the nucleus and therefore the chemical nature of the atom. Thenew chemical element produced by such a change may also be stable or radio-active. The radioactivity of different elements plays an important part innuclear energy.3. The commonest type of interaction between atoms affects only theelectrons; the nucleus remains untouched. Reactions of this kind, of whichthe burning of coal is one example, are called chemical reactions and the energy they release or absorb is relatively moderate. The energy and heatprocesses involved in a modification of the nucleus of an atom are about amillion times greater. The purpose of nuclear fission or hydrogen fusionis to achieve the release of energy on this scale. A controlled hydrogen fusionreaction is not at present in sight, but the control of nuclear fission is well established.4. Nuclear fission takes place when a free neutron, the uncharged con-stituent of the nucleus, is made to strike the nucleus of a fissile element, e.g.,uranium 235.   The three main results are as follows: (a) The nucleus splits into two &quot; halves&quot; which fly apart releasingenergy which appears as heat.
(b) Several new neutrons are released by, the affected nucleus.   These-: can serve a variety of purposes:  (i) Some of them may collide with; other fissile nuclei, repeat the process of fission, and so establish a chain reaction, whichcan be controlled to provide a continuing release of energy.(ii). Others may be captured by the nuclei of neighbouring non-fissile atoms, such as: uranium. 238. ; This then becomesuranium 239 which is radioactive and changes rapidly toplutonium 239.   Plutonium 239, by contrast with uranium; 238, is fissile, that is, it will itself undergo fission whenstruck by a neutron, j  !(iii) Finally, some neutrons may be a total loss, in the sense that they may be absorbed or lost in ways which make no contribution either to the chain reaction or to the productionof fresh fissile material.(c) The two &quot; halves &quot; into which the original nucleus splits are calledfission products. In general they are radioactive and because theyare harmful to life and may be destructive of materials it is necessaryto keep control of them for a long time; but fortunately their bulkcan be made quite small.5. The heat from the fission of the nuclei can be used to produce steamto drive an electric generating plant. The reactor, i.e. the plant in whichfission takes place, is thus the equivalent of the coal or oil-burning furnaceof existing power stations,A Typical Nuclear Reactor6. The practical application of these basic principles can be illustrated by the reactors two of which form part of the experimental power station nowbeing constructed at Calder Hall. This kind of reactor, which is illustratedin Chart I, consists of a mass or core of graphite which is called the moderator.This core is built up from many thousands of separate and accuratelymachined graphite bricks; It contains numerous vertical channels; and it isenclosed in a pressure shell of steelsurrounded by a shield of concrete. the fuel is natural uranium which consists to a small extent (one part in 140) offissile uranium 235 and to a much greater extent of non-fissile uranium 238.It is fabricated into rods which are sealed in metal cans and placed in thevertical channels within the graphite core; and nuclear fission takes placein these rods, the surplus neutrons emitted travelling about in the graphiteand uranium until they produce further fissions or are absorbed to formplutonium or are lost. The heat that is liberated is removed by the circula-tion of carbon dioxide gas under pressure through the core. The graphite&quot; moderates &quot;, or reduces, the average speed of the neutrons produced by thefission reaction to the low value known as the thermal level. A reactorwith a moderator is therefore called a &quot;thermal&quot; reactor. If there were nomoderator a large proportion of the neutrons would be absorbed by the relatively abundant uranium 238, which captures fast neutrons more readilythan does the&quot; uranium 235, and the chain reaction would come; to an end,The^fissibn, processes controlled at a fixed leVel of :a0t^vity by moving rods ofneufrbn-ahsbrbing material in or out. -&apos;. &apos;n$r*5$fc,the, nuclear r,eactiQn\proceeds. some -of the fissile uranium .235;,is;grad&apos;u^ilyV;used [Upr; a&quot; small fraction /ofntheo uranium 238 is: converted;.by.;.neutron qapmre^nto^its fissilej offspring plutonium;: 23.9 ;., structural changes,take place in the fuel rods owing to the neutron bombardment.to.:Whjqhithevi

8. The rate at which the fissile fuel is allowed to burn is expressed in termsof the output of heat, i.e., in megawatts per metric tonne of fuel. Thefraction of fuel burnt depends on how fast it burns and how long the fuelelement remains in the reactor. If one tonne of fuel burning at a rate of3 megawatts remains in a reactor for 1,000 days, the level of irradiationachieved is 3,000 megawatt days per tonne (MWD/T).
Nuclear Fuel Systems9. The main characteristic of nuclear energy that makes it attractive as a source of power is the enormous amount of heat available from a givenquantity of fissile material. One pound of pure fissile material could, ifcompletely &quot; burnt&quot;, produce more heat than a thousand tons of coal.But the only naturally occurring fissile element is uranium 235, which occursmuch diluted by the non-fissile uranium 238. If we were able to &quot; burn &quot;only the uranium 235 we should be using the natural uranium inefficientlyand much of the advantage of nuclear energy would be lost.10. Fortunately a nuclear reactor can be used not only to produce heatbut to produce further fissile material by converting what are known as&quot; fertile&quot; materials, such as uranium 238 and thorium 232, into fissilematerials. Thus a reactor of the Calder Hall type uses natural uraniumcontaining both fissile uranium 235 and fertile uranium 238. The fissile material is &quot; burnt&quot; to produce heat while a small part of the fertilematerial is changed into new fissile material. The amount of new fissile material produced varies according to the fuel system and the type of reactorused. In some circumstances it is possible for more fissile material to beproduced than is consumed, in which case the &quot;gain factor&quot; is said to bepositive. Reactors in which this occurs are sometimes called &quot; breeder&quot;reactors. A fuel system with a positive gain factor has an obvious attractionfor a country such as the United Kingdom with no large indigenous sources of uranium or theorium.11. The quantity of fissile plutonium 239 produced in reactors based onnatural uranium is less than the quantity of uranium 235 consumed sothat the gain factor is negative. The plutonium can be extracted and usedeither in the same type of reactor instead of natural uranium or in different types of reactor. If the plutonium is used in conjunction with uranium 238,further plutonium 239 will be produced as fissile offspring. The gain factorwill still be negative (in a thermal reactor) but using the plutonium from theearly reactors implies a much more efficient use of natural uranium in thesystem as a whole than would be possible with natural uranium alone.12. When enough plutonium has been obtained from a natural uraniumsystem there are two other ways in which it could be used. In the first place it could be used with the fertile element thorium 232 in a thermal system,producing uranium 233 as a fissile offspring. The uranium 233 could thenbe extracted and used again in place of the original charge of plutonium.The gain factor would here be approximately zero, that is about as muchuranium 233 would be produced from the thorium 232 as was used up, sothat the use of raw material would be highly efficient.13. Alternatively the plutonium could be used with uranium 238 in a&quot; fast&quot; reactor system (i.e. a system in which there is no moderator). Inthis case the gain factor could be made decisively positive so that moreplutonium would be produced than was consumed. This would be a bigadvance in the economic use of nuclear materials.The Development of Reactors14. There are four types of atom that can be used as moderator in athermal reactor: carbon, light hydrogen, heavy hydrogen, and beryllium.Carbon, in the form of graphite, is likely to be the most practical moderatorin the immediate future. Light hydrogen in light water (ordinary water)is a possible alternative for reactors producing power on a large scale.These two have obvious advantages over the others from the supply point
of view. A reactor also needs a coolant; and here too a range of possibilitiesis open comprising at present a gas such as carbon dioxide or helium, heavywater, light water and molten sodium metal. Carbon dioxide and light waterare the most probable choices for this country in the next few years.15. The only reactor for commercial power production that is within ourpresent technical reach in terms of design and construction in the near futureis the type now being built at Calder Hall, using graphite as the moderatorand a gas, probably carbon dioxide, as the coolant. The first reactors ofthis type designed specifically for the commercial generation of electricitycould be built beginning about 1957, and begin operating in about 1961.The heat rating would be relatively low so that the capital cost for eachunit of electricity sent out would be high.16. The next step in the design of thermal reactors would be to increasethe heat rating. Higher ratings should be obtainable from advances in the design of the gas-cooled reactors. Alternatively a liquid could be substitutedfor a gas as the coolant but this gives rise to more complex technologicalproblems and, unless heavy water is used, requires a higher concentration of fissile material in the fuel than is present in natural uranium. This higherconcentration could conveniently be provided by the plutonium produced inthe early reactors. These enriched reactors could themselves produceplutonium 239 which could then be used for enrichment in further liquid-cooled reactors, or for starting a thorium system or a fast breeder reactor,or could be fed back into the same reactors instead of natural uranium.. 17. A large-scale prototype of a liquid-cooled thermal reactor could probably be constructed and fully tested by about 1963. This might enablecommercial reactors of the same type to be completed by about 1965, bywhich time plutonium would be beginning to come from the early CalderHall type reactors. One type that could probably be produced on a com-mercial basis by that date is a light water reactor, using light water underpressure both as coolant and moderator. Other possibilities are liquid-sodium-cooled graphite-moderated reactors and heavy-water reactors.18. The design of a thermal reactor might be still further simplified, witha saving in capital cost, if its fissile material were supplied in the form,not of solid metal rods, but of some kind of solution or suspension whichcould also serve as coolant and moderator. A homogeneous reactor, as this type is called, should also have lower operating costs since there would no longer be any need to fabricate solid fuel elements and encase them inprotective material to prevent chemical and corrosive attack by the coolant.It might have a small positive gain factor. It is unlikely that a prototypeof a commercial station could be constructed until at least the mid-1960s.19. In order to obtain breeding of plutonium with a large positive gainfactor, a fast reactor will be required, i.e. a reactor without a moderatorin which the neutrons are permitted to cause fission of the fuel while they still have a considerable fraction of the energy with which they are born.The small core of a fast reactor presents many difficult technical problems,associated both with heat transfer and with the effect of high temperatureon the fuel elements. The solution of these problems will take time. the design of an experimental model of a fast reactor capable of producing power is already in hand. This will be built at Dounreay and will produce dataand experience for further developments. A prototype of a commercialstation is not, however, likely to be tested until 1965 at the earliest; and production plants could not be expected to be in operation until the 1970s.

The curve and ahextrapolation&apos;of it are shown &quot;in Chart III.. .     . , &apos;.      I&apos;2. A second method is to make a more detailed analysis, of the individual;sectors of demand and of the factors which influence their growth, Forinstance the expansion of industrial demand can be related partly to the expected growth of industrial production and-partly to the known trend towards the use of electricity in substitution for other fuels in industry.The forecast of domestic consumption is based on the, known trend of the rapid expansion in the use of electricity in the home and on the farm, andon the expected growth in the number of consumers. Similar estimates canbe made for the increase in commercial demand and in the demand fortraction purposes.3. These two methods produce much the same result,.which is summarised in the following table:  ;Electricity Consumption in Great Britain, Milliard units(Thousand million kilowatt hours)1925       1950       1953       1965       1975.

The British Electricity Authority have made detailed estimates up to1960 which are in line with this longer-term and much more speculativeforecast. The assumed rate of increase is also not inconsistent with that envisaged for the United States and for the rest of the free world in thereport to the President of the&apos; United States by the Paley Commission^(The Paley Commission forecast a growth of 3j times in the.United Statesbetween 1950 and 1975, compared with this, figure of about 4J times for theUnited Kingdom which starts from a&apos;much lower consumption, a head).

FUEL USED IN MILLION TONS OF COAL EQUIVALENT
6. Nevertheless the implication of even these conservative estimates is thatin about 20 years&apos; time electricity consumption should be running at about 3 times the present level. The rate of growth, which in recent years has averaged7 per cent, a year, would on these estimates fall to about 6 per cent, a year in the early 1960s and to about 5 per cent, a year in the early 1970s.Generating Capacity Required7. The growth in the industry&apos;s capacity over the last 30 years, and theefficiency with which its plant has been used, is illustrated by the followingtable: Capacity of Public Electricity Supply SystemCapacity installed Number of unitsYear                        at end of year sent out per kilowatt(thousand megawatts) installed1925    ..,      ......            4.4 14221935    .........             8-1 2,049]l%    .........            12-3 2853JJ2    .........            15-1 3,4421954    .........            20-7 3,342In 1954, the industry had an average of 20,000 megawatts of installed capacity,and its maximum available capacity during that year (after allowing for break-downs, overhauls, &amp;c.) was 80 per cent, of this figure. A further improve-ment in plant utilisation may be expected through a reduction in the time required for repairs and a closer integration of the system, so that by 1975it might be over 85 per cent. The average load factor in 1954 was 49 percent. : and some improvement may be possible, perhaps raising it to 52 percent, by 1975.8. On these assumptions the total generating capacity required in 1975would be of the order of 57,000 megawatts installed. Allowing for some,000-4,000 megawatts of hydroelectric and pumped-storage plant and for10,000 megawatts of existing plant still in operation, this implies the installa-tion in the next 20 years of new plant equivalent to about 45,000 megawattsinstalled, or 40,000 megawatts sent out a programme which, on the basis ofcoal-fired power stations alone, would cost about  2,500 million. On thepresent B.E.A. programme the capacity installed each year should already have reached about 2,000 megawatts sent out by 1960 ; on the forecasts usedhere it might well have to exceed 3,000 megawatts sent out during the 1970s.Coal Required for Power Stations9. The thermal efficiency of coal-fired power stations has improved rapidly in the last few decades, as the following table shows:  Efficiency of Steam Stations of the public Electricity Supply SystemYear No., of lb. of coal used per unit generated1925 .....    ....     ... 2-431935 .......     ... 1-541945, ...   ......    ... 1-421950 ... 1-371954 ...      ....... 1-26The figure for 1954 corresponds to an average thermal efficiency of about23-6 per cent. The best modern stations already have a thermal efficiency ofof 30 per cent., and it is possible that the average efficiency in 1975 might
be as high as 30-32 per cent. On the basis of the figures given above and ifthe calorific value of the coal used by the industry continues to be no less thanit is now, the total fuel equivalent required by the power stations would beabout 65 million tons in 1965, and might rise by 1975 to a figure in the region of 100 million tons. A proportion of this coal is expected to replaced byoil; but in round terms it may be assumed that 20 years hence, in theabsence of nuclear power, the power stations would be consuming about100 millions tons of coal, i.e., about 2  times as much as at present, andtwice the 50 million tons now estimated for 1960. By 1975 the rate of con-sumption might be rising by about 4-5 million tons a year.The Cost of Generating Electricity10. The cost of generating electricity in a modern coal-fired power station,operating at a high load factor and having a thermal efficiency of about 30 percent., is about 06d. a unit, made up as follows: Pence per unitFuel cost (including handling)   ...... 0-38Other   costs   including   interest   and depreciation      ......      ...      ... 0-220-60*How this will vary in the next ten or twenty years is uncertain but on balanceit seems unlikely that the cost of electricity will show any great change com-pared to other prices. It is possible that the pressure on coal supplies will tend to force up the price of coal used by power stations. On the other handnew stations will be more efficient so that less coal will be required for eachunit, and there will be other developments that should also reduce costs.Examples are: bigger generating units, simpler buildings, higher temperaturesand pressures in the boilers and higher load factors. It seems reasonable to assume for practical purposes that the. cost of generating electricity from new coal-fired stations used as base-load stations will continue to be in the region of 06d. a unit.* The average cost of supplying the consumer is about 1 - 3d. a unit which includes thecost of transmission and distribution and also the higher cost of operating the less efficientstations at peak periods.printed and published by her majestvs stationery officeTo be purchased from york House, Kingsway, London, w.c.2     423 Oxford Street, London, w.1P.O. box 569, london, s.e.113a Castle Street, Edinburgh, 2     109 St. Mary Street, Cardiff39 King Street, Manchester, 2     Tower Lane, Bristol, 12 Edmund Street, Birmingham, 3     80 Chichester Street, belfast or from any BooksellerPrice     net;, -:/Vl,&apos; j955   -;if,u&apos;;       /  .-[    t]      ..PRINTED   IN, GREAT  BRITAIN(30728)  Wt. 1418-1216   121   2/55  d.l.     &apos;&quot;

Our knowledge of the means of producing electricityfrom atomic power on a large scale has, thanks to the efforts of&quot; the Atomic energy authority and its predecessors, now reached the stage when it has become possiblefor the Government to decide to embark on a programme of big nuclear power stations comparable in output to modern coal-fired stations. In our view thesuccessful use of atomic energy to generate electrical power on a commercial basisis of crucial importance to the future of the national economy.The Government also look forward to the time when the United kingdom will be able to assist other countries not only, as now, with their research anddevelopment programmes and with training their scientists and engineers, butalso by exporting nuclear power stations for the generation of electricity especiallyin areas where generation by other means may be difficult or more expensive.Copies of the White Paper describing the provisional programme drawn up by theGovernment for the construction and development of nuclear power reactors over., ,,  .    ,   Printed Paper - ^the next ten years or so are available in the-77-Office.Vote
