43. From the experience of the last nine years set out in the earlier partsof this paper certain facts and conclusions emerge.Research44. In the first place an adequate programme of research and the necessarycapital facilities for such a programme are vital to success. Research canbe described as the process of creating scientific capital. It comprises allthat work, much of it of a very theoretical and fundamental nature, whichis not directed specifically to meeting immediate Service requirements. Someof it contributes to the solution of current problems, but much of it goesto build up the fund of basic knowledge needed to meet future requirements.Today&apos;s research leads, it may be said, not to tomorrow&apos;s aircraft (for theyare already being developed today) but to those of the day after tomorrow.45. In the aeronautical field much of the research is done by the experi-mental establishments of the Ministry of Supply and by other authorities ;that done in the industry is also of great importance, and will grow insignificance as the additional research facilities which the industry is itselfproviding, co-operatively and individually, come into use.46. The plans for the provision of extensive and up to date experimentalfacilities at Ministry of Supply establishments are now maturing and great benefit will be derived from the new facilities as they come into use. Thetempo of aeronautical progress is such, however, that even newer and more advanced facilities must be provided, and it must be recognised that theirprovision will impose a growing financial burden.&quot; Weapons Systems &quot;47. An aircraft must be treated not merely as a flying machine but as acomplete &quot; weapon system &quot;. This phrase means the combination of airframeand engine, the armament needed to enable the aircraft to strike at its target,the radio by which the pilot is guided to action or home to base, the radarwith which he locates his target and aims his weapons, and all the oxygen,cooling and other equipment which ensure the safety and efficiency of the crew. Since the failure of any one link could make a weapons systemineffective, the ideal would be that complete responsibility for co-ordinating the various components of the system should rest with one individual, thedesigner of the aircraft. Experience elsewhere has shown that this is notpossible but it is the intention to move in this direction as far as practical considerations allow.Development48. Even before the war development took many years ; in the case ofthe Spitfire it started with the Schneider Trophy Races of 1927-31, which led to the reappearance of the monoplane. The specification from whichthe Spitfire was evolved was issued in 1935 ; development proceeded from1935 and it was not until 1940 that large scale production was achieved.The success of the final production was due in no small measure to the time spent on the development process.49. Modern aircraft are vastly more complicated ; to take only one example modern bomber needs 60 times the weight of radio and electrical equipmentcarried by a pre-war bomber. Clearly the development time cycle up to release to service, though it varies from aircraft to aircraft, can hardly beless than before the war.50. The starting point of the process of development is the assessment ofthe defence needs of the country and the strength of a potential enemy.  In
the light of this a requirement is stated by the Service Department concerned.The requirement may have to be modified to some extent to take accountof the Ministry of Supply&apos;s advice as to what it is technically reasonable to aim at in the required time scale, but the essentials of the requirementare determined by the threat which it is intended to meet. The operationalrequirement is then translated into a technical specification by the Ministryof Supply. The designers ability to achieve what is called for by the specification turns largely on the extent to which an aircraft of the perform-ance required can be designed within the framework of the basic technical knowledge available at the time. This reinforces the vital importance of research programme of adequate size and of the right content.51. When the specification is issued, designs to meet it are called for from industry. These designs may involve radically different solutions of theproblems posed.  Those to be developed are selected on their technical merit.52. The early phases of development involve calculations of stresses, per-formance, etc., initial drawing office work and the construction of models,rigs, etc. for wind tunnel and other testing. This phase overlaps designas the latter is often dependent on the results of these tests. As constructionof the first aircraft proceeds, re-design and further tests are needed. Thenbegins testing of the aircraft first on the ground and then in the air. Flighttesting must be done progressively ; a prototype is gradually subjected to more rigorous and searching tests and manoeuvres. As faults are revealed,re-design and rebuilding is required.53. When the manufacturer is satisfied that the aircraft has reached a stagewhen its performance can be evaluated, it is sent to the Aeroplane and armament Experimental Establishment of the Ministry of Supply, where itis tested and assessed by trained pilots, specially selected and seconded fromthe Services. If it is not acceptable, it is returned to the manufacturers for improvement. When it is finally brought to an acceptable standard, it isformally released to service. The process of testing and proving everyitem of a weapon&apos;s system, however, is inevitably protracted and it is thus the normal practice for the first release to be a partial one, which is extendedprogressively as the tests proceed. Release to service is not the end ofdevelopment, for this continues throughout the service life of the aircraft, to remedy faults and improve performance and reliability.54. During all these processes there must be complete co-operation betweenthe Service, the Ministry of Supply and the manufacturer.55. Development is the most difficult, as well as the longest, stage. Thedifficulty increases as the growth of our basic knowledge opens up possi-bilities of&apos;more rapid advances in many fields. It is in development, ratherthan production, that the difficulties have been encountered which haverecently held up the re-equipment of the Services with aircraft of thelatest types.56. These processes are difficult enough if everything goes well and plansremain unchanged. If can be readily realized how much they are com-plicated by changes during their course in the assessment of the war riskor of the enemy&apos;s potential, leading in turn to changes in requirements and plans.Production57. When production is ordered, plans must be prepared, and materials,special components, sub-assemblies, etc., ordered from sub-contractors, who in turn have to plan and set up production. Drawings are made, jigs andtools designed and manufactured, and labour recruited.1A
58. The complexity of a modern aircraft affects production no less thandevelopment; a modern day fighter, for example, requires 12,000 to 15,000production drawings compared with [6,500] for a wartime fighter. Thus itis seldom possible to get the first aircraft less than 2^-3 years from thetime of ordering.59. The early phases of production, however, must almost invariablyoverlap the later phases of development although these are often the most critical; otherwise the time from the formulation of a new operationalrequirement to the delivery of aircraft in quantity would be 12 years or more,at the end of which the original requirement might well have materiallyaltered so that the aircraft eventually delivered might be already obsolete.Modifications60. The length of the development process gives particular point to the difficult question of modifications. There are really two classes of modifi-cations, those which are essential and those which are desirable. Withinthe first class come modifications designed to bring an aircraft under develop-ment up to the required performance ; these are inevitable, and any resultantdelay in production has to be accepted. Modifications essential for safetyalso come within this class. But there is also the continuing need to incorporate during the development of later marks of the aircraft othermodifications intended to extend performance beyond that originally con-ceived; often this arises from new assessments of the nature of the enemythreat. These are the second class of modification. With these there is a constant dilemma ; on the one hand they can greatly prolong the usefullife of an aircraft; on the other hand few of them can be made withoutmajor changes in design and their introduction not only absorbs design and production resources, but also causes delay. This second class ofmodification can, however, be introduced at some convenient point in theproduction process and need not necessarily delay delivery of earlier versions.61. The objective is in the case of each mark of an aircraft to incorporateonly modifications in the essential category, and to defer those which are merely desirable to a later mark of aircraft. Such decisions are not easyand require the exercise of extremely skilful judgment as to the right timing.Development Batch62. In paragraph 26 the delays caused in the past through shortage ofprototypes have been mentioned. To minimise delay from this cause, itwas decided over a year ago that in all appropriate future cases a develop-ment batch of a dozen or more aircraft should be ordered, instead of twoor three prototypes. The delivery programme for these aircraft will be carefully planned so that the full programme of development testing canbe carried out in the most expeditious manner, while the later aircraft ofthe batch are so phased that the lessons learned on the earlier ones can beapplied to them. The production of the development batch will also beso arranged as to lead smoothly into the full-scale flow of production. Thefirst opportunity of putting this policy into practice has been in the case ofthe P.1, and as was announced by the then Minister of Supply on 1st March,1954, a development batch of 20 of this aircraft was ordered.&quot; Shorter Steps &quot;63. The larger the steps by which development of new types of operational aircraft proceeds, the greater the technical difficulties and the risk of failure.Had an interim swept-wing fighter been fully developed after the war as acombat aircraft, we should have known earlier of many of the problemslater encountered on the Hunter and Swift.  A policy of shorter steps would

Thus itis seldom possible to get the first aircraft less than 2-J-3 years from thetime of ordering.59.

The larger the steps by which development of new types of operational aircraft proceeds, the greater the technical difficulties and the risk of failure.Had an interim swept-wing fighter been fully developed after the war as acombat aircraft, we should have known earlier of many of the problemslater encountered on the Hunter and Swift.  A policy of shorter steps would
mean more frequent but shorter advances. This would not only have theadvantage of easing the technical problems, but would mean that at any point in time, an up-to-date aircraft would be well advanced in development and in the event of an emergency could be put into production relativelyquickly. The extent to which the Services should be re-equipped at.eachstage would be governed both by the assessment of the international situationand by financial considerations; to establish a technical advance, however,it is not essential to go into full production. Whilst the full consequences of a policy of shorter steps are still being examined, it appears that despite the possibility of greater expenditure on development, the overall result would be an economy of. the nation&apos;s resources and an increase in itspreparedness at any point.Use of Resources Available64. The dangers of undue dispersion of the aircraft industry&apos;s resourcesover too wide a variety of projects are obvious, but some measure of insurance is necessary. To take the case of the three V-bombers as an example, it has already been shown in paragraph 13 above that the Valiantis an interim type ordered as an insurance, which is entering service appre-cialy earlier than the Vulcan and - Victor. Only the latter can fully meetthe Royal Air Force&apos;s requirement, but at the time they were started bothwere such advanced conceptions and employed such widely differingapproaches that it was a wise precaution to develop them in parallel. Similarlyit has been explained how the Swift was ordered in an unforeseen crisis asan insurance.Experience in other countries65. The development troubles experienced in this country have been setout as fully as security allows in this paper, but it should not be thoughtthat other countries have not also had these troubles. Even in the UnitedStates, where much more extensive facilities have been available and a more vigorous programme of research in supersonic flying was undertaken immedi-ately after the war, development problems similar to ours have been encountered, even with such an outstandingly successful aircraft as the Sabre.Summary66. The experience of the last ten years leads to the following conclusions:  (a) Development and not production is the difficult stage in the supplyof military aircraft; it is bound to be lengthy.(b) A large research programme is necessary to ensure that development is on technically sound lines.(c) The weapons system concept must govern development.id) An adequate number of aircraft must be available for developmentpurposes. In other words, the development batch procedure isessential.(c) Modifications which are not essential must be so phased into thedevelopment and production programme as not to cause delay.(/) Owing to the rate of technical advances, it may well prove more economical in the long run to advance by shorter, though more frequent, steps.(g) The system must permit design teams to propound different solutionsto the problems posed, but this must not lead to such dispersal of effort that little of it is effective.[(ft) There must be the closest liaison in every phase between the Serviceconcerned, the Ministry of Supply and the manufacturers.]12(30753)  WL1466-8452   101  2/35  D.L.PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN
