secret(55) 37 COPY NO.       Q10th February, 1955CABINETAIRCRAFT PRODUCT ION:  THE SWIFTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of SupplyA grave position has arisen affecting the Swift single-seat fighterunder construction by Vickers Supermarine.2. Seven marks of Sv/ift were ordered.    The Swift 1 and 2 are completed and have been delivered, 35 in all; the role of the remainingmarks of Swift and the number at present on order are as follows:-Mark 3	Intercepter Fighter	25Mark 4	Interceptor Fighter	269Mark 5	Fighter Reconnaissance	81Mark 6	Photographic Reconnaissance	32Mark 7	Fighter Carrying air-to-air		guided missiles	503. There have been continuing technical troubles with the Swiftsince the first aircraft flew -and the task of rectifying these defects withina reasonable period of time has been made much more difficult by the lackof an adequate number of prototypes.    Many modifications have been incorporated.    No less than 11 different types of tail have been tried, and250 hours flying, which is a wholly exceptional figure, have been undertaken at the Ministry of Supply Establishment at Boscombe Down in an effort togive the aeroplane a satisfactory clearance.4. Despite all this effort, tests recently undertaken on the Mark 3at Boscombe Down and at the Central Fighter Establishment have shown thatit is quite unacceptable to the Royal Air Force as a fighter aircraft.    Thegoverning reason for this is the lack of elevator control at high speed and high altitude which is so serious that the pilot is unable to control hisaircraft.    This means that formation flying would be impossible and air fighting dangerous because at the high speeds which are necessary inattacks on bombers, aircraft could not be pulled out of a dive and collisionwith the target would become unavoidable.    Additionally, under operationalconditions and techniques, the fuel consumption during take-off, climb andcombat is so high that the endurance of the aircraft is unacceptable to theR.A. F.    The firm, on the other hand, has reserved its position on thequestion of endurance and maintains that the aircraft meets the specificationto which it has been built05.     -    As regards the Mark 4 we are advised that the improvements ascompared with the Mark 3 are marginal and that the Mark 4 will not be acceptable any more than tho Mark 3 as an operational aircraft,,    The firm&apos;: &apos; -    \- .. &apos;&apos;   y- &apos; .&apos; &apos;M &apos;
however have said that in their opinion the Mark 4 may be somewhat betterthan we at present think and as a fully modified aircraft is now available fortesting we have agreed that it should be tested very urgently at BoscombeDown.    We hope to have the result by the middle of the week.    In our opinioihowever, we must lay our plans on the assumption that the Mark 4 will haveno value as an operational aircraft for the R. A. F.6. The Swift Mark 6 whose role is photographic reconnaissancewould be required to operate at the same heights as the fighter Mark 4 andit is clear that it would have the same defects, particularly as regardsendurance, as the Mark 4.    We must, therefore, assume that the Mark 6 alsowill be unacceptable to the P.. A. F.7. This leaves the Mark 5 (fighter reconnaissance) and the mark 7, which is the only fighter designed to carry Blue Sky, our first air-to-air guided weapon.    The Mark 5 as a. fighter reconnaissance aircraft will not be required to fly at the same heights as the Marks 3, 4 and 6 andit is possible that it may be found acceptable for the R.A. F.    As regardsthe Mark 7, Blue Sky will not be available for use by the R, A. F. for another18 months which gives us that period of time to get the Mark 7 right.    Thisassumes that authority is given for an immediate order for Blue Sky.Moreover, Blue Sky was designed as a weapon to attack enemy bombers ofthe type of the TU4 flying at about 35,000 ft. and it is at this height that itgivc:n   its optimum performance.    Operating at this height, the Swift is less subject to the defects which are encountered at greater altitudes.8.          We have discussed with the firm the industrial and financialconsequences on the basis that there is no operational requirement for the mark 3, the. Mark 4 or the Mark 6 and that our commitments on the Marks 5and 7 would be reduced.    All Mark 3s (25 in all) have been built and, althougisome of them await final modification, we have no alternative but to accept them in their present state. _______9. As regards the Mark 4, the firm say that 28 aircraft are so farcompleted that there is no alternative but to finish them and that for industrial reasons it is necessary to complete a further 12 Mark 4s, making40 in all, before they could change over to Mark 5s and 7s.    In addition tothe completion of 40 Mark 4s the firm consider the minimum continuingorder which would enable Supermarines to survive as a viable unit is50 Mark 5s, and 30 Mark 7s.    An order of this size would enable them toto keep the nucleus of an organisation together and to preserve a lead into the new naval fighter, the N. 113.    In view of the uncertainty about theMarks 5 and 7, our Departments are jointly considering whether a fighterreconnaissance and a Blue Sky version of the Hunter could be developedinstead.10. On the financial side it appears that, if all work was cancelledimmediately, the sum to be paid by the Government covering the cost ofwork done but not completed and of closing down the contract would be 21 millions.    If, on the other hand, 40 Mark 4s, 50 Mark 5s, and30 Mark   7s were left on order and completed the bill to be met by theGovernment, including the cost of finishing off these aircraft, would be 24, 5 millions.11. The question of the disposal of 40 Mark 4s if left on order raisesissues of great difficulty, apart from the uncertainties about the Marks 5: and 7, &apos; \ .VV;&apos;V: \W:^V---. :-
v V...&apos; -.&quot;.&apos;; &apos;&apos;..&apos; &apos;.: :-f\- -&quot;. r\.: r-:&apos; v.. -./: ;v- -../-&apos;     .:.-12.        So far as the R. A. F. is concerned, if no more Swifts are  &apos;delivered to them they would be obliged to make good the deficiency thus:     .   created, to order additionally 376 Hunters and: 17 Canberras (the latter in. lieu of the Mark 6 Swift).    It is estimated that the cost of these would be ofthe order of  35 millions, to which should be added the  21 millions to bepaid on the Swift contracts, i. e. a total of  56 millions.13. If, on the other hand, the Royal Air Force found it possible toaccept  /arks 5 and 7, the substitution bill would be reduced from 35 millions to  29 millions, to which would be added  24.5 millionspayable for the Swifts,.a total of  53.5 millions.14. These two figures, of  56 millions on the one hand and 53. 5 millions on the other, compare with a figure of  45 millions onSwifts Marks 3-7 if the Swift programme were completed.15. In addition, about  10 millions has already been spent by the Air .Ministry on Marks 1 and 2 which will have to be withdrawn from the R. A. F.,and on engines and spares.    If the Marks 5 and 7 prove acceptable, about 2. 5 millions worth of these engines and spares will be of use.16. .       If the Marks 5 and 7 prove unacceptable and it becomes necessaryto develop fighter reconnaissance and Blue Sky versions of the Hunter, therewill be additional expenditure on research and development, the cost ofwhich cannot as yet be estimated.17. Whether or not the Marks 5 and 7 Swifts are proceeded with, theAir Ministry now expect to spend some millions less in 1955/56 on aircraftthan they have assumed in drawing up the Air Estimates, with a correspond-ing increase of expenditure in the two later years, when the level of AirVotes would in any case have risen.18. It will be possible to minimise the effect of the Swift cancellationon the fighting efficiency of the front line of the R. A. F. by drawingsubstantially on our Hunter reserves.    Assuming we do this, it will still benecessary to retain the Meteor in Fighter Command for a few months afterthe last squadrons would otherwise have been re-equipped, and to prolongby six months the life of the Venom in the 2nd T. A. F.19. We recommend that, unless more favourable news is available from Boscombe Down when this memorandum is considered -(i)       the order for the Mark 4 should be limited to a total of40, and the order for the Mark 6 cancelled;(ii)       the order for the Mark 5 should be reduced to 50 andfor the Mark 7 to 30, on the understanding that afurther decision as to the continuance of these reducedorders will be taken as soon as possible.20.        The Minister of Defence agrees with these recommendations..! D.1..D. -S.L.9th February, 1955.
