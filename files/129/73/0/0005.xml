8a(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)- r---- ----------------------------- -------------------------  i . . . -        ----     .1&apos; secret.(55) 5 COPY NO.11th January, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of Stats for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 6th December the Cabinet invited the Colonial Secretary and myself to arrange for the preparation of draft legislation designed to placerestrictions on the admission of British subjects from overseas to theUnited Kingdom and upon their subsequent stay here, and to submit thedraft legislation for consideration by the Cabinet (C. C. (54) 82nd Conclusions,Minute 7).    Legislation to give efTsct to such a control would necessarily be somewhat complicated but, after a number of discussions between our two Departments, instructions have been given to Parliamentary Counseland the preparation of a Bill is now in hand.2.        The draft legislation would be on the following general lines:-(a) An immigration officer (acting in accordance with such.directions as the Secretary of State might give) would beempowered to px-ohibit persons within certain clases ofBritish subjects, British protected persons and (probably)citizens of the Republic of Ireland from landing in theUnited Kingdom.(b) The classes of British subjects who would be subject toprohibition would be all except those born in the United-Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, or inpossession of a valid United Kingdom passport issued bythe Government of any  of those territories.(c) The immigration officer would not have power to prohibit &quot;a person liable to exclusion under (a) above from landingif the immigration officer were satisfied that he was areturning resident or genuine temporary visitor or could support himself and his dependants in the UnitedKingdom, or if he produced to the immigration officer an employment permit issued by the appropriate authority.(d) A person not in the exempted classes (soo (b) above) wouldbe liable to exclusion because of a criminal record, on. .    medical grounds, or for other reasons which wouldprobably need to be specified in the Bill,

(e) The Secretary of State would also be empowered, if he deemed it to be conducive to the public good to do so, tomake an expulsion order, with the same effect as aDeportation Order against an alien, against an individualBritish subject, British protected person or citizen ofthe Republic of Ireland, except where the individuallrbelonged&quot; to the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands- or the Isle of Man by birth or residence for, say, 7 years.(f) Discussions are still proceeding between Departments on whether there should be an appeal against an expulsionorder, and if so what the procedure should be.3.        The proposed procedure differs from that applied to aliens inthat it avoids requiring British subjects from overseas to seek leave toland in the United Kingdom.    This has a psychological advantage and itis also advantageous from the administrative point cf view, since it means that there would be no need to make arrangements to regulate traffic which it is not thought necessary to control, e.g. the ordinary traffic between Great Britain and Ireland..
