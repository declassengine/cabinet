secret.(55) 23 COPY NO24th January, 1 955CABINETHORROR COMICSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 6th December (C.C.(54) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 3) theCabinet authorised me to arrange for the preparation of a draft Bill toprevent the publication and sale of hcrror comics, which I now circulate for my colleagues&apos; consideration.2. In clause 1 the form of the publications to which the Bill may apply is defined within very narrow limits, but the considerations to whichthe court must have regard in deciding whether the publication of aparticular work is an offence are necessarily stated in more general terms.    In order to secure uniformity in administration it is proposed toarrange that in England and Wales the police should not take proceedingswithout first consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions, as they already do in connection with matters relating t6 obscene publications.In Scotland proceedings will be instituted by ov on behalf of theLord Advocate.3. The penalties provided in clause 2 are such that in Englandand Wales a defendant who has been once convicted under the Bill will beentitled to claim trial by jury on any subsequent charge under the Bill.4. The powers of search and destruction in clause 3 are more restricted than those in the Obscene Publications Act, 1857; the importantdifferences are that a search warrant under the Bill cannot be grantedunless proceedings have been instituted against the person concerned,and no publication can be destroyed unless there has been a convictionin respect of it.5. Clause 4 prohibits the importation of publications to which theBill applies, and articles for printing them.6. The Bill has been prepared in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland.    I am satisfied that it is so narrowly drafted thatthere is little danger that it could be applied to any other type of publication than that against which it is directed, and I seek authorityfor its early introduction.Go LL-G.Home Office, S.W.1.22nd January, 1 955,
