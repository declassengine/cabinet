1ITHE REPORT OF THE ESTIMATES COMMITTEEON THE FOREIGN SB R. VICEMemorandum by the Financial Secretary, treasury the Seventh Report of the Estimates Committee on the foreign service was published on 10th November, 1954, and, in the House on13th December, the Foreign Secretary said:  &quot;I have read this Report, towhich I will in due course be issuing a Departmental reply ... 0. .    Inconsultation with my right honourable Friend the Chancellor of theExchequer and my honourable Friend the Minister of Works, I am having an immediate examination made of the practicability of the recommendations made by the Select Committee and I will inform the House as soon aspossible&quot;.2.        On 22nd December (C.C. (54) 9lst Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet approved the appointment of a Committee, of which I was madeChairman, to examine the proposals in the Report.    We are now engaged onthis, and as two issues have emerged which, if not decided at an early stage,might cause delay later, the Committee have asked me to refer them to theCabinet.3.        The Estimates Committee made, in all, eight recommendations(set out in the Annex to this paper).    In the course of their Report they alsocommented on the size and emoluments of the Foreign Service, without making any specific recommendations thereon, other than that there shouldbe an independent inquiry into the Foreign Service (Recommendation 5 in the annex).4.        We feel no doubt that a reply must be made to all these recommends.&quot;3tions and comments.    The question is whether there should be a Departments,!reply to the Estimates Committee (the normal procedure) and also anannouncement to the House by the Foreign Secretary on the practicability of the recommendations, or alternatively a White Paper laid before bothHouses.5.        A similar? question arose a year ago in connection with a report bythe Estimates Committee on Civil Defence.    In that case, it was contended that to reply by a White Paper was open to objection as contrary to practice.,and also as implying that the Estimates Committee were entitled to dealwith general issues of policy.    In the event, the Home Secretary referredto some urgent matters arising from the report in a written Parliamentaryanswer, and later communicated his more detailed views to the estimates committee in a memorandum which was subsequently published by theCommittee in the normal course.COPY NO. d-XCABINETSECRETC0(55) 1119th.

V3S6.        The substance of the reply will not differ greatly, whether it is submitted by way of a memorandum addressed to the Estimates committee or by a White Paper, but to know which, form the reply should take would assist us in drafting our report to the Cabinet, and would probaoly savetime later.    We have still a good deal to do in examining the report anddeciding what we re commend should be done about the proposals andcomments in it.    We can hardly be ready to report to the Cabinet intime for a comprehensive reply to be submitted to Parliament in the weekit re-assembles, but we recognise that such a reply should not long be delayed.7.        If the Government wish to publish a comprehensive reply at anearly date, probably it can only be done in a White paper    The reason isthat the new Estimates Committee has net yet been appointed^    Amemorandum cannot be communicated to that Committee until it exists;and, when the Committee has been appointed and has elected its Chairman,it would rest with the Committee, and not with the Government, to arrangefor the presentation ?.nd publication of the Government1 s reply.    The replymight therefore not be published for some weeks.    That is the case infavour of a reply by means of a White Paper, widen, could be published assoon as it was ready.    At the same time we feel bound to bring to theattention of the Cabinet the objections indicated in paragraph 5 above.8.        A question of a different character arises on Recommendation 4in the Annex, namely, that &quot;urgent consideration should be given by theHouse of Commons to the way in which proper supervision is exercised by its Committees over the ever-increasing expenditure authorised byParliament to be incurred in foreign territories&quot;.    This is a subject towhich a good deal of attention has been paid in the past.    Indeed, it is in line with some remarks made by the 1950/51 Estimates Committee in an earlier report on the Foreign Service.    It would be of assistance to knowwhether the Cabinet would like us to include in our report some considera-tion of this matter (although it goes much wider than the other issues raised by the Report which we are instructed to examine) or whether theCabinet would prefer to deal with it in some other way.9.        We, therefore, seek the guidance of the Cabinet on:-(a) the manner in which the reply to the Report ofthe Estimates Committee should be made;(b) whether we should include in our examinationtne wider issue referred to in paragraph 8above.H.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.18th January, 1955.
COT-RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE SEVENTH REPORT OF THEESTIMATES COMMITTEE (1953/54)10 The Treasury should investigate the staff position at Bonn withoutfurther delay.2C The Foreign Office should examine the system of educationalallowances used by Imperial Chemical Industries.3. The next inspection of the Foreign Office should be carried outby the Organisation and Methods Division of the Treasury,,4a Urgent consideration should be given by the House to the way inwhich proper supervision can be exercised by its Committees over theever-increasing expenditure authorised by Parliament tc be incurred inforeign territories.5. The time has come for an independent enquiry to be made intothe Foreign Service to see how it is working and whether it is properlydevised for the functions it is expected to perform.6. Insufficient vigour has been shown in dealing with the problemof avoiding fantastic rents by buying houses.7, There is a case for examining a system under which all enter&quot; .tainment expenses would have to be separately accounted forn8. Need for reduction in the amount of overtime worked in theForeign Office,\
