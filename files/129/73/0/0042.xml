Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955SECRETC. (55) 4214th February, 1955CABINETLANCASHIREMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeThis paper is about Lancashire. A number of economic and political problemscentre in that county. It may help my colleagues if I set them out and myreflections on them.2. Statistics show that Lancashire is not predominantly a textile county sinceonly 14 per cent, of the labour force works within that industry. But if we relied upon such figures they would play us false. The dominant interest remains textiles,and many towns are largely dependent upon this industry alone. Other industriescan and do absorb textile workers over a period and particularly in the buoyantindustrial conditions which exist to-day. Lancashire industry as a whole is thriving,but if textiles slump a large part of Lancashire slumps too. Such an event couldnot be devoid of all political significance.3. How do textiles stand to-day? By many of the recognised indices theLancashire textile industry is fairly flourishing. Production of yarn and cloth isstill very high. On paper there are nearly four labour vacancies in cotton weavingand spinning for every unemployed textile worker. In spite of the clamour aboutimported cloth, Lancashire has retained well over 90 per cent, of the home market for cotton and rayon cloth; in the case of yarn its share is well over 95 per cent.Taken all round 1954 was a good year for textiles. High employment, goodearnings and good profits matched each other to spread prosperity within thecounty.4. Unfortunately there is another side to the picture. For eighteen monthscow the industry has been warning me that trouble lies around the corner. one day they may be right and I feel bound to warn my colleagues that there are indications that this day may not be far off. There is already some scatteredshort-time working and it may spread.5. It is important if we are to find a remedy or even a partial remedy tounderstand the reasons which underlie this situation and what it is that Lancashirewould like the Government to do. For convenience I group the problems in the succeeding paragraphs under the following heads: competitive efficiency, Indiangrey cloth, Japan, price rings, and purchase tax, and I summarise at the end thebest arrangement I can suggest consistent with the national interest.6. It is essential to recognise that the main reasons for the difficulties into which Lancashire may be running is the loss of its export trade. Exports ofcotton cloth fell from 865 million square yards in 1951 to 710 million square yardsin 1953-a decline of 155 million square yards, Last year there was a furtherdecrease of 70 million square yards lost largely to Japanese and Indian competitionparticularly in the Colonies and the loss of export trade to cheap competitors isone of the facts of the situation which probably must be accepted,47663Copy No.
-5 -3*Competitive Efficiency, 7. It is almost certain that this industry could do a good deal more than itdoes to improve its competitive efficiency and I have constantly urged in public and in private discussions: with leaders of the industry the need to speed upre-equipment and adopt modern production methods if as large a share as possible of the export.-tradeis to; be saved. Many shrewd critics have, urged the. industryto do what the ablest, men in it are already doing, namely to modernise at the pace of its rivals arid concentrate on those types of production in which it can best compete) probably at the higher quality end.In addition I considered along time ago whether the Government could make some special intervention toassist this process, through, for example, a subsidy or some other form of financialassistance to the Weak weaving section of the industry to facilitate its re-organisalionand development. This could be analogous to the subsidy for the spinning sectionof the industry introduced in 1948. 1 have discussed this idea informally with anumber of the leaders of the industry and they have all told me that we would dofar better to leave the industry atone. Frankly I am doubtful whether, even ifthe industry were prepared to co-operate, it would be desirable or practicable forthe Government to help in this way. Reorganisation will take place: the industry will be compelled to adapt itself to the present realities of the world markets, inwhich some of the industry&apos;s export trade will be lost for good. But this processwill be determined by the hard logic of events and will be accomplished better andmore smoothly if done by the industry itself. At any rate I cannot say that thereis, at present, any industrial support for Government intervention on these lines.Indian Grey Cloth8. There is a powerful agitation going on to stop or limit the imports ofIndian grey cotton&quot; cloth. Imports of grey cotton cloth from all sources rose steeplylast year but are in fact very little higher in total than the annual average since thewar. They consist largely of cheap Asian cloth finished here and re-exported.While we could do a good deal of damage to our export trade by limiting theimports of this grey cloth we would achieve little if anything to help Lancashire inits difficulties.9. . Lancashire cotton cloth production is about 2,000 million square yards ayear. Imported grey cotton cloth amounts to about 236 million square yards a year,the Indian being some 128 million square yards. About half the Indian cloth is re-exported and to stop this coming in would almost certainly mean the furtherloss of export business; the cloth would be finished elsewhere and sold in third countries at prices with which we could not compete. The other half of theIndian grey cloth could hardly be excluded altogether and any cut of its importwould make, an almost negligible contribution to Lancashire^ real problem, whichis falling exports with which I deal later.10. At the moment, therefore, I am not satisfied that there is a case for action.I am particularly anxious that no one on behalf of the Government should evenhint at the possibility that we might take early action since this would lead to arush of buying to frustrate anything which we might later do.11. I wish to emphasise that there are considerable dangers in any action we might take. The Indian cotton textile industry has always been closelyidentified with Congress. No Indian industry arouses political emotions more easily and this was made clear to the Minister of State, Board of Trade, during his recent visit. If we proceed to restrict imports of grey cloth I cannot answerfor the reactions of the Indian Government: The whole future of the Trade ,Agreement of 1939 would be called in question. I do riot want this. The indian government would be under strong domestic pressure to abandon imperial preference altogether. At best, we should lose some useful preferences in India.12. Nevertheless I am naturally considering what action I could take if inthe last resort I am compelled to limit these imports. I am examining the problemsof presentation which would arise if it became necessary to apply either a quotaor a tariff. To that end I am pressing the Cotton Board to give, me much moreevidence than they have so far, for example on comparative United Kingdom and indian costs and prices, and which we would need if we were going to be ableto state anything like a presentable case justifying restrictions.
13. A tariff against India - would raise formidable difficulties. these difficulties do not as is popularly-and erroneously supposed arise from theprovisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.(G.A.T.T.). They go far wider and deeper. Apart from any re-negotiation of our Trade Agreement with india there is the question of what to do about other Commonwealth countries.&apos;It would be a major departure from our long-established policy to impose a tariffor, for that matter, a quota against India which discriminated against her inrelation to other Commonwealth countries. To avoid such discrimination we should probably need, therefore, to modify the Ottawa Agreements with other Common-wealth countries. In addition, tariff action could not be confined to cloth but would have to extend to goods made from it, and other industries would press for similar treatment. Legislation would be necessary.14. An alternative which would be least likely to involve re-negotiation ofour Trade Agreement with India would be to impose non-discriminatory quota restrictions under Article XIX of the G.A.T.T. But I think we are a considerableway off the threat of &quot; serious injury &quot;to the industry, which would justify invokingArticle XIX. If the pressure here were to induce us to act long before theconditions of Article XIX could be shown to be satisfied, other nations would notbe slow to seize upon the precedent and invoke the same Article against our exports. The liberalisation of the textile trade in Europe might easily been dangered. In fact, such action would run counter to all we have been doingto limit quota restrictions on trade, in the Organisation for European&apos;economic co-operation, in the G.A.T.T., in the &quot; Collective Approach &apos;? and in discussions with the United States.15. My colleagues will recognise from these considerations that this problemgoes much wider than Lancashire. If we are forced to act against these imports in existing conditions we shall have to pay a formidable price in loss of preferencesfor something which can at best assist Lancashire to little more than 1 per cent,of her production. My intention, therefore, is to complete the preparation of thebest case which could be stated for a quota or a tariff but for the time being tohold on.Japan16.   Lancashire&apos;s anxieties are:  (i) Japan and G.A.T.T. Here our decision to invoke Article XXXV will be popular.(ii) Japanese copying.  The industries of the two Countries are in touch.  in practical terms there is very little scope for Government action.(iii) Japanese textile exports to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.17. The small import quotas for the home market are not seriously criticised by the industry. The  3 million quota (equivalent to some 55 million square yards)for grey cloth for finishing and re-export, though unwelcome to our spinners andweavers, is essential to our export trade.18. In these circumstances I consider that in the next trade and paymentsnegotiations we should hold the textile quotas for the home market at or below their present level. The quotas were originally established as one of the stepsneeded to improve Japan&apos;s precarious sterling position and so to enable her tomaintain her sterling purchases. Since she is now accumulating sterling we certainly need go no further. .19. Lancashire&apos;s real problem is, as I have already said, not imports butdeclining exports. The decline, in exports of 70 million square yards of cotton cloth between 1953 and 1954 would have been worse but for an increase of26 million square yards to Australia which we may find difficult to hold on to andwhich masked to some extent the damage which we are now suffering from,competition in the Colonial markets. In British&apos; West Africa alone we lost40 million square yards, in other British Colonies we lost 34 million square yards,and we only-held our own in East Africa because of a licensing policy morefavourable to us than that now to be adopted.&apos; 20. Part of the competition in these Colonies comes from India, but the realanxiety from the point of view of Lancashire is the increased competition from&apos; 47663&quot; [^^^r^^^ ^ ^
Japan. The striking increase in Japanese exports, of cptjtpn cloth to British WestAfrica last year is shown by the following figures: -, ;Japanese Exports of Cotton and Rayon Cloth(Million square yards)IS)--I    1953 &apos;    r -    ;.......   .     - 1954 - ,\ - m 7k:v -&apos;:-h;-:1st.,;    \y-:     2nd- . .   . 3rd ,,SK3;vu Quarterly average Quarter    ;    Quarter Quarter-        7-3      &apos; - &apos; -     3-6&apos; 10-7 ^ 24-0    &apos;^-wrLancashire could get.real help if the Colonies cut back their imports from Japan,if Japah&apos;s sterling balances, which are now again substantial, continue to rise weshould be justified in doing again as we did in similar conditions two or three yearsago. It would not be easy to explain that we were unwilling or unable to take similar action when the sterling area has a debit balance of payments with Japan,unless our overall balance of payments difficulties justified it. rt conclude on this aspect of the matter that the most solid help we could give to Lancashire would beto persuade the Colonial Governments to steady a little the flow of Japanese clothinto these Colonial markets. If something on these lines is contemplated, warning to Colonial Governments is needed now or the forward orders will certainly beplaced in Japan.Price Rings.21. It is not my purpose in this paper to analyse the various restrictive practices which operate within the textile industry, many of which stem from the depressionof the 1930&apos;s. Nevertheless it is relevant that the Government is to-day undersevere attack for what is alleged to be an unwillingness to carry out a vigorouspolicy against monopoly practices.: It so happens that the only.outstanding Reportfrom the Monopolies Commission upon which we have delayed decision is thaton the Calico Printing Industry. The Calico Printers use grey cloth, including ofcourse the Indian and Japanese grey, process it and sell it at home and abroad.Some of the Calico Printers&apos; price maintenance and other devices are severely criticised by the Monopolies Commission and it will be very hard to defend our general policy on Monopolies or uphold the authority of the Commission if wereject the advice which the Report contains. Action, however, would riot?be popular with the Calico Printers.   E.A. (55) 23 deals more fully with this issue.Purchase Tax &apos;22. Lastly, there is the question of purchase tax. Purchase tax in the textile industry is imposed upon the basis of what is known as the D Scheme. This means that the whole of the tax is borne by the high-quality end of the industry. this method of taxation was introduced on the advice of the Douglas Committee toavoid or reduce the difficulties which arose from the utility scheme. Lancashireis now saying that the tax distorts the pattern of production and discourages the;very move into the higher qualities in which some hope for the future seems to liejNor is it easy to resist the criticism that it is unfair that the cheaper grades which,include those from India and Japan are free of tax while Lancashire&apos;s own higherquality goods have to bear it. Certainly the abolition of purchase tax on textiles and clothing would be very popular. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will, no;doubt, wish to reserve his position about the cost to the Revenue which might be some  40 millions. This would almost inevitably lead to concessions having tobe made for other industries, which would add to this cost, and there are many other considerations involved. I mention purchase tax because it is a burningissue in Lancashire and no report on the state of Lancashire would be completewithout reference to it.Conclusion23. The Lancashire textile industry faces serious difficulties and its leaders-insist that they can and should be solved by Government action. They are wrong in thinking that Government action can solve these difficulties. But we shall be criticised unless we take steps to help them. I would summarise my approachas follows:  ,(i) We should not at present pursue the idea of any scheme: for giving a subsidy or other financial assistance for re-equipment, for example tothe weaving section of the industry.
(ii) We should not at present restrict imports of cotton cloth from India; weshould refrain from giving any hint that such action is considered asan immediate possibility,(iii) We should have ready the case on which we would rely if we had to applya quota or a tariff to restrict imports of foreign or Indian grey cloth.(iv) We should aim at maintaining substantially. the present restrictions on united Kingdom imports of Japanese cloth and we should send a warning letter to Colonial Governments and look closely at thepossibility of persuading them to reduce their imports of textilesfrom Japan.(v) We should examine the action to be taken on the report of the monopolies commission on Calico Printing upon its merits as set out inE.A. (55) 23.24. I am sure that the Chancellor will bear in mind, against the background of the many other considerations which he necessarily has to weigh, the advantages which would flow from the removal of purchase tax on textiles.25. I will naturally keep my colleagues in touch with this situation as itdevelops but in the meantime I ask for their general approval of the policysummarised in paragraph 23.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,14th February, 1955.
