2o6THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1955CONFIDENTIALC. (55) 2425th January, 1955CABINETWESTERN EUROPEAN union memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsUnder the Paris Agreements of 23rd October, the Brussels Treaty organisation is merged in Western European Union (W.E.U.). Privileges and immunitiesfor the Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission and its officials were accordedin the United Kingdom by an Order in Council made in 1948 and extended by two amending Orders made in 1949. A new Order in Council will be necessaryto confer these privileges and immunities on the new Organisation and to adaptthem to the new circumstances. Under the provisions of the international organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act of 1950, no such Order in Councilcan now be made except to give effect to an international agreement. No such agreement was ever concluded between the Brussels Treaty Powers. The first step must therefore be to negotiate an agreement with the other members of w.E.U. The headquarters of W.E.U. will be in London and its privileges and immunities are thus primarily a matter for the United Kingdom. The Council andits Committees, however, may occasionally meet in other capitals; the agency for the Control of Armaments will be located in Paris and the W.E.U. assembly will normally meet in Strasbourg. It is therefore important that the privileges and immunities of the Organisation should be of general application in the territories of all member States.2. W.E.U. is to work in close co-operation with the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.) and will perform functions comparable in importancewith those of N.A.T.O. The W.E.U. Assembly will be composed of therepresentatives of the Seven Powers to the Consultative Assembly of the Councilof Europe. It would therefore seem appropriate that the new Agreement defining the privileges and immunities of W.E.U. should be modelled, in so far as theAssembly is concerned, on the corresponding Section of the 1949-52 agreement on Privileges and Immunities for the Council of Europe and, for the rest, onthe 1951 N.A.T.O. Agreement on the Status of N.A.T.O., national representatives and international staff, which was signed at the time when N.A.T.O, itself had its headquarters in London. Orders in Council to give effect to these agreements in the United Kingdom were recently approved by both Houses of Parliament.3. The privileges and immunities which would be enjoyed by W.E.U. are summarised in the annex to this paper. It is impossible at this stage togive a comprehensive figure for the number of persons who would qualify forprivileges and immunities under the new United Kingdom legislation. Theexisting Brussels Treaty Secretariat, consisting of 3 senior and 20 junior officials,is likely to increase when the Western European Union comes into being. the agency for the Control of Armaments may, as time goes on, assume considerableproportions, but its headquarters will be in Paris and its field of operations is limited to the Continent, so its officials will rarely visit the United Kingdom.4.   I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to: -(a) the negotiation with the other members of W.E.U. of an Agreementdefining the privileges and immunities of W.E.U., and(b) the submission to Parliament in due course of a draft Order in Councilbased on that Agreement.A.

ZcTlPRIVILEGES  AND  IMMUNITIES FOR THE WESTERN  EUROPEAN.ir5j n^si^Sox?&apos; 1   UNION    *fjg        &apos; &apos;&apos;IT%J;^.;;&apos;JThe Brussels Treaty Orders in Council cover (a) the Organisation itself;(b) the secretariat of the Organisation.The new Order in Council will need to cover also (c) experts employed on missions by the Organisation;id) representatives of member States to the Council and its subsidiary bodies,and their staffs;(e) representatives of the member States to the Assembly.The Organisation2.   The existing Orders in Council accord the Organisation (i) the legal capacities of a body corporate;(ii) immunity from suit and legal process;(iii) inviolability of archives and premises;(iv) exemption from taxes and rates other than taxes on importation of goods.The new Order in Council would reproduce these provisions and grant alsothe right to import and export goods for official use and official publications free from customs duties and quantitative restrictions. The justification for this newprivilege is that the new Organisation will require a larger secretariat, a largerbuilding in London and probably some increase in the material required for theinformation and publicity services of the Organisation. These developments wouldinvolve larger increases in the budget which would have to be met by contributions from member Governments unless this privilege (which is already enjoyed byN.A.T.O;) were conferred.The Secretariat3.  The existing Orders in Council give (a) to the Secretary-General and the two Deputy Secretaries-General (evenif they are Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies) their wives and children under twenty-one, full diplomatic privilege, i.e.,(i) immunity from suit and legal process;\^     (ii) inviolability of residence;(iii) full tax exemption;: (b) to other officials (even if they are citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies) 1(i) immunity from suit and legal process in respect of words spokenor written or acts done in performance of their official duties;(ii) exemption from tax on their official salary.4. The new Order in Council, if we follow N.A.T.O. precedent, will reducethese privileges. Senior officials, other than citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, but not their wives or children, will enjoy (i) immunity from suit and legal process;(ii) inviolability of residence;(iii) exemption or relief from taxes other than income tax;(iv) exemption from income tax in respect of official salary.5. . If a senior official is a citizen of. the United Kingdom and Colonies, he willenjoy only:  .-. (i) immunity from suit and legal process in respect of words spoken or writtenor acts performed in the course of his official duties;, :(ii) inviolability for papers and documents relating to his work;  i(iii) exemption from income tax in respect of his official salary.
6. The position of other officials (including citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies) will be broadly similar to their position under the existing legislation(see 3 (b) above).7. The number of officials in the employ of the Organisation will turn largely on the size of the Armaments Agency in.Paris which cannot yet be assessed. the headquarters staff in London will certainly have to expand beyond the presentfigures of 3 senior and 20 other officials but it is impossible to say how much.Experts employed on Missions by the Organisation8. Technical and military experts may be required from time to time to assistthe Organisation in its new function, particularly in connexion with the agency for the Control of Armaments. It is proposed that these experts should have thesame treatment as their N.A.T.O. counterparts, i.e.: (i) immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of theirbaggage;(ii) immunity from suit and legal process for words spoken or written or actsdone in performance of their official duties;(iii) inviolability of papers and documents relating to their work for theOrganisation.Experts who are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, when in theUnited Kingdom, would not enjoy immunity (i).Representatives of member States to the Council and its subsidiary bodies, and theirstaffs9. The present Orders in Council make no provision for permanent representatives because the continental members of the Brussels treaty organisation (B.T.O.) have been represented by their Ambassadors in London andtheir staffs. In future certain countries may wish to set up permanent delegationsindependent of their Diplomatic Missions as is done in the case of N.A.T.O. Thenew Order in Council would therefore follow the N.A.T.O. precedent and give thePermanent Representative and his staff the same privileges and immunities as would be accorded to diplomatic representatives of comparable rank. Theseprivileges and immunities would not be enjoyed by the United kingdom permanent Representative or his staff, when in the United Kingdom.10. Other national Representatives in the Council and its subsidiary bodieswould enjoy:  (i) immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of personalbaggage and inviolability for all papers and documents;(ii) immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and of^ things done in their capacity as representatives.Their official clerical staffs would be given an immunity similar to (ii) andinviolability for all papers and documents. Again, these provisions would notapply to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, when in the UnitedKingdom.Representatives of the Member States to the W.E.U. Assembly11.  The B.T.O. had no parliamentary body.The new Order in Council would give representatives to the W.E.U. Assembly(18 from the United Kingdom, 87 in all), the same privileges as are enjoyed by representatives to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, i.e.:-(i) immunity from arrest and legal proceedings in respect of words spoken orvotes cast in the exercise of their functions;(ii) during the period of the Sessions of the Assembly, while attending meetingsOf Committees of the Assembly (whether or not the Assembly itself is then in Session), and during their journey to or from the place of meeting, in the case of the United Kingdom representatives^ the sameimmunity from arrest or legal process as Members of Parliament enjoyand, in the case of the representatives of other countries, immunity from arrest and prosecution, except in flagrante delictol I
