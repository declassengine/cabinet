Comments on the seventh Report from theSelect Committee on Estimates
introduction the Seventh Report from the Select Committee on Estimates dealing withthe Foreign Service was published on 9th December. The Report containedmajor errors, such as the statement that the number of Foreign Serviceofficials serving abroad in a representative capacity had increased by almost7 per cent, in the last year, whereas the number had, in fact, decreased byabout the same percentage. It also gave rise to misleading impressions, forexample that Foreign Service expenditure amounted to  200 million a year(instead of just under  20 million). The Foreign Secretary corrected thesemis-statements in answer to a. Parliamentary Question of 13th December(Official Report, Volume 535, Column 1391). At the same time he undertook that the practicability of the recommendations contained in the Report would receive careful examination in the Departments concerned. This examinationhas now been completed.2. Although the Report, of the Select Committee contained a largenumber of critical statements and observations on various aspects of theForeign Service, the Committee confined the recommendations with whichthey concluded their Report (paragraph 82) to four. These were asfollows:  (1) The Treasury should investigate the staff position at Bonn withoutfurther delay (paragraph 26).(2) The Foreign Office should examine the system of education allowancesused by Imperial Chemical Industries (paragraph 50).(3) The next inspection of the Foreign Office should be carried out by theOrganisation and Methods Division of the Treasury (paragraph 78).(4) Urgent consideration should be given by the House to the way in whichproper supervision can be exercised by its Committees over theever-increasing expenditure authorised by Parliament to be incurred in foreign territories (paragraph 81).The fourth recommendation raises issues which cannot properly be dealt within this Paper.  Recommendations (1) to (3) are examined in Part I.3. In addition, however, to these four specific recommendations, theReport in effect includes four further proposals that an independent enquiry should be made into the working of the Foreign Service (paragraph 79);that in order to avoid &quot; enormous expenditure on rents &quot; more houses orflats should be purchased or built (paragraphs 51 to 53); that all entertainmentexpenses should be separately accounted for (paragraph 61); and that theworking of systematic overtime in the Foreign Office should be abolished(paragraph 77).  These proposals are examined in Part II.4. The body of the Report also contains a number of other statements and conclusions which are incorrect or unjustified. The Committee appearoften to have disregarded or misunderstood the explanations which were givento them. In some cases the Committee, having admitted their inability toform a definite judgment, proceeded to express a critical view: for example,they said &quot;Your Committee are not in a position to determine whetherthe allowances are either inadequate or extravagant&quot; (paragraph 44), yetelsewhere conveyed the impression that these allowances are, in fact,extravagant. Other statements appear to . be founded on an imperfectunderstanding of the tasks and obligations of contemporary diplomacy. Inparticular, the Committee took little. account of the entertainment requiredfor, and by, distinguished travellers from the United Kingdom, not excludingMembers of Parliament.
5. In view of the misleading impression created by many passages in theReport, it is desirable to deal at length with some of the matters discussed and also to include in this Paper some explanation of the reasons for thegrowth of the Foreign Service and of the system of calculating foreignallowances. It is hoped that these will serve to clear up any misconceptionsto which the publication of the Report has given rise. These explanations,-together with corrections of many of the erroneous or misleading statements made in the Report form Part III of this Paper.PART IRecommendation 1&quot;The Treasury should Investigate the Staff Position at Bonn withoutFurther Delay &quot;6. In paragraph 26 of their Report the Committee imply that there hasbeen inadequate control of the numbers of staff employed at Bonn and thatthe Foreign Office and the Treasury have been dilatory in the steps takento reduce staffs. In fact this matter has been the subject of continuous and careful consideration by both the Foreign Office and the Treasury.7. From the end of hostilities until 1949 the control of Germany wasin the hands of a Military Government. In September 1949 a federal government was set up in Western Germany and the control functions of theAllied Authorities were taken over by the Allied High Commission in western Germany. The Headquarters of the British Element were established in the Bonn/Wahnerheide area in order to be near the seat of the federal government. At this stage it was decided that the staff of the ControlService who had hitherto been provided with food &amp;c. in the same way aspersonnel of the Armed Forces should be given allowances to enable themto purchase their own requirements.8. A full scale inspection of allowances and organisation was made by foreign Service Inspectors in 1951 and following their recommendations, thestaff was reduced from 4,252 in April 1951 to 2,180 in April 1952. One ofthe officers who conducted the inspection was subsequently appointed ChiefAdministrative Officer in Germany to ensure that the reorganisation was planned on normal Foreign Service lines. In 1953 an inspection was madeof the Consulates and the Information and Cultural Relations Services witha view to planning their post-ratification establishment and integrating thework of the Laender offices and the Consulates. As a result further economieswere effected.9. In May 1952 Conventions^) were signed in Bonn which wouldhave resulted in the termination of the occupation of Western Germanyand in the replacement of the High Commission by an Embassy at Bonn (andby Consulates elsewhere in Western Germany). Owing, however,. to the delays in ratifying the Conventions, the High Commission has had tocontinue as such, and because of the peculiar factors attached to theoccupation status, e.g., support from occupation costs, the administration and common services have continued on Control Service lines. The size ofthe common services and administration divisions is in consequence large byC) &quot; Germany, No. 6 (1952),&quot; Crod. 857118720-13   47552
Foreign Service standards but these branches of the High Commission arebeing pruned all the time and it should be possible in the year following theend of the occupation to reduce this staff to proportions approximating tothose at other large Missions abroad.10. The Foreign Office and the Treasury had already come to theconclusion that the most suitable time for an inspection would be not duringthe existence of the High Commission but two or three months afterratification. In accordance with this policy, a full inspection coveringstaffing, organisation, allowances, &amp;c, in the Embassy and Consulates hadbeen planned to take place in the &quot;autumn of 1954 on the assumption thatratification of the Bonn Conventions would have taken place earlier in theyear, as at one time expected. Provisional arrangements have now beenmade for such an inspection, which will take several months, to begin earlyin June 1955. A Treasury representative will be associated with the inspection.11. In the meantime staff complements and gradings in Germany arebeing kept under constant review. The Chief Administration Officer inGermany acts in some respects as a resident Inspector and he visits london from time to time for consultation with the Foreign Office. As a resultit has been possible, in spite of the delay in ratification, to secure progressivestaff reductions month by month. The total United Kingdom-based staffin Germany, including staff at consulates, has been reduced from 933 on1st April, 1954, to 841 on 1st December, 1954. The United Kingdom-basedstaff at Headquarters (excluding the Cultural Relations and InformationDivisions, which have been the subject of consideration by the drogheda committee) declined from 386 to 350 during the same period. The total british staff in Germany is now approximately 1/15th of what it was fiveyears ago.12. The economies which have been made in recent months have made it possible to reduce the estimate of the staff which will be required at the embassy at Bonn after the agreements come into force below the figuressubmitted to the Select Committee in March. The revised figures (with thefigures given to the Committee in brackets) are:  United Kingdom-based.........    245   (311)Locally engaged .........    324   (539)It should be emphasised that these figures are still only tentative and aredepedent on the rate at which it is possible to shed some of the occupationfunctions of the High Commission. Moreover, these figures are in no sensefinal and only represent the expected position at a given stage in a gradualrun-down. xWhat has been said above does not mean that the staff at Bonnwill not be quite substantially reduced within a year of ratification and oneof the chief objectives of the forthcoming inspection will be to plan forthis continued run-down of staff. A material factor in the run-down of thestaff engaged on administration and common services will be the concentra-tion of the whole Embassy staff in Bonn on completion of the new building.13. The Committee refer in paragraph 72 of the Report to theexpenditure on the Embassy offices at Bonn. As was explained to themit was essential to build offices because of lack of accommodation to rent.When the extension to the new building has been completed, there will be room in the Embassy for a staff of 250. Even with this accommodationit will still be necessary after ratification to house part of the staff in theonly building it has been possible to rent in Bonn, but it will no longer be necessary to accommodate some of the staff in Cologne and Wahnerheide
fifteen miles away. It is estimated that, one year after ratification, the costof running these outposts (additional security guards, clerical staff (forregistries, communications, extra transport, rent) will be at least  30,000a year. This estimated saving will offset the cost of the new buildingwithin a few years, and in addition the concentrated offices will greatlyimprove the efficiency of the mission.14. The Committee refer (in paragraph 79) to the huge size of the&quot; proposed new establishment &quot; at Bonn. This might be taken to imply that new staff would be taken on but, as has been explained above, the embassy establishment after ratification will be substantially smaller thanthe present establishment in Bonn.15. Some of the Occupation functions will terminate within a fewmonths of ratification while others v/ill continue for an indefinite period.For example, it will still be necessary to employ British Warders to look after the War Criminals at Werl Prison. There will be a continuingcommitment in respect of support costs for the British forces in Germany,which will add substantially to the work of the Economic staff. Residualwork in connection with German external debts, reparations,. restitutionand the deconcentration of heavy industry will continue. British judgeswill continue to sit on the Supreme Restitution Court and there will alsobe British representation on the Arbitration Tribunal, the ArbitralCommission and other mixed boards.16. Apart from these residual functions of the Occupation, the embassy in Bonn will have responsibilities which do not fall on any normal Embassy.These arise from (1) the maintenance of four British Divisions, the 2nd Tactical Air Forceand other Forces in Germany;(2) the special position of Berlin, where we shall maintain military government; and the responsibilities which we retain as a result ofthe division of Germany.For these reasons, as was explained to the Committee, it is misleading to compare the future Embassy at Bonn with any normal Embassy (seeparagraph 25 of the Report).Recommendation 2&quot; The Foreign Office should examine the System ot EducationalAllowances used by Imperial Chemical Industries &quot;17. The Foreign Office have examined the evidence submitted to theSelect Committee by a representative of LCI. and have also obtained further particulars about the firm&apos;s. arrangements direct from the firm.18. It should be noted that, as the Committee were informed(Question 1583), LCI. are not altogether happy that their scheme is adequate and are examining it to see whether they can and ought to improve it.19. The LCI. system does not offer an insurance scheme but makes provision in the emoluments of an officer on the assumption that he wouldtake out an insurance policy to cover the cost of educating a child. Allmarried employees who have reached a certain salary receive an allowance of  50 a year and this is increased to  100 a year when they reach a slightly
higher salary. These payments are made to married employees irrespective of whether they have children or not. Ths Foreign Service system, on theother hand, provides specifically for each child at boarding school, while a lesser sum is provided for children who are not at boarding school but notresident with their parents overseas. Under the Foreign Service scheme the help given is thus based on the circumstances of the individual and from thispoint of view would seem to be more satisfactory.20. An estimate has been made of the cost of applying the LCI. schemeto the Foreign Service and it is clear that it would cost Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment considerably more than the present Foreign Service scheme(approximately  54,000 as opposed to  36,000).21. The adequacy and suitability of the Foreign Service scheme are being kept continuously under review, in the light of changing circumstances and needs. ......Recommendation 3&quot; The next Inspection of the Foreign Office should be carried out bythe Organisation and Methods Division of the Treasury&quot;22. The Foreign Office maintain close contact with the O. and M.Division of the Treasury and frequently seek their advice. Among othermatters on which the O. and M. Division have recently advised are thefollowing:  (1) The accounting system in use at headquarters and at Foreign Office. posts abroad.(2) The registry systems in use abroad.(3) The pay system in use at the Foreign Office.(4) The   staffing   and   organisation   of  the   Foreign   Office  finance department.23. The Foreign Office propose to invite the O. and M. Division of theTreasury to examine progressively each further branch of the Foreign office which falls within the general purview of O. and M. investigations.24. Full inspections of the Foreign Office were carried out in 1949 and1953 by Foreign Office Inspectors and each time the O. and M. Division were consulted on particular questions. When the next full inspection of theForeign Office takes place, officers of the Treasury, including the O. and M.Division, will be associated with it,.PART IIThe Committee say that they are of the opinion that the time has comefor an independent enquiry to be made into the Foreign Service to see howit is working and whether it is properly devised for the functions it isexpected to perform.   (Paragraph 79.)i .25. The Committee appear to have in mind an enquiry with very wideterms of reference. This would unavoidably involve the examination of questions of policy which are the prerogative of the Foreign Secretary.!26., After careful consideration Her Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;have cometo the conclusion that an enquiry of that character would not serve the best interests of either the Service or the nation.
727.   It is proposed to take the following steps:  (i) to arrange for a Treasury official of suitable standing to be attachedto the Foreign Service Inspectorate to participate in inspections;(ii) to consult a number of commercial firms employing substantial numbers of home-based staff in- foreign countries with a view tocomparing notes on their systems and standards of emoluments.28. Careful consideration will be given by the Foreign Office, inconsultation with the Treasury, to all the information gained in these ways tosee if any modifications in . such matters as the system of calculatingallowances for staffs abroad or in organisation are required.The Committee consider that insufficient vigour has been shown indealing with the problem of avoiding enormous expenditure on rents bybuying houses.   (Paragraphs 51 to 53.)29. Any substantial long-term saving on rents abroad can only beachieved by increased expenditure on buying or building houses. But theamount &quot;of money available for building and buying properties overseas hasof recent years been barely sufficient to keep pace with the necessary creationof new missions and with urgent functional requirements, with the result thatthere has been little opportunity to buy property for the specific purpose of avoiding payment of high rents.30. Apart from budgetary considerations, many factors have to be takeninto account when the purchase of residential accommodation in foreigncountries is being considered. A house which is quite suitable for a short-term hiring may well not be adequate as a permanent acquisition. Tied tothis is the lack of flexibility which ownership of property entails. The size of the staff at the post in question may well alter as may the individualfamily requirements of successive officers.31. Another point which has to be considered is whether there is anytendency for the character of the district where the house is situated to deteriorate. What may be suitable now might well be unsuitable in tenyears&apos; time. Again, the more houses which Her Majesty&apos;s Government own,the larger the staff required to look after them. Finally, of course, very careful calculations have to be made on the financial aspect of each case toensure as far as possible, that fluctuations in market prices or in the rate ofexchange will not turn what is now an attractive proposition into a badbargain within a few years.32. In spite of all these considerations, there are undoubtedly a numberof places where it would be advantageous to acquire houses. In 1954-55for the first time there has been a specific allotment ( 50,000) for the purchaseof suitable buildings which might become available during the financial year.The allotment Will be substantially increased in the estimates for 1955-56,shortly to be submitted to Parliament.The Committee thought that there was a case for examining a system under which all entertainment expenses would have to be separatelyaccounted for.   (Paragraph 61.)33. Entertainment expenses are at present covered by the system of allowances for Foreign Service staff abroad which is explained at length inPart 111.
34. It is not possible to isolate the provision made in the frais of Headsof Mission for specific entertainment. The cost of entertainment cannot intheir case be identified because it is inextricably mixed up with housekeepingcosts. The Foreign Office are, however, proposing to put into forceexperimentally a system whereby specific entertainment on the part of morejunior officers (First Secretaries and below) would be met on an expensebasis and not included in the foreign allowance. Such officers would berequired to report details of expenditure on entertainment in order to recover the cost, within the limit of amounts which would be fixed by the inspectors as suitable to their grade at the post concerned. If after a periodof trial this system proves satisfactory and economical it will be adoptedpermanently.Overtime (paragraph 77)35. In paragraph 77 of the Report the Committee refer to the practiceof working regular overtime which is followed in the Foreign Office as inother Government Departments in London. The Foreign Office and theTreasury have taken note of the Committee&apos;s views in this matter. As theCommittee are aware, it is at present before the Royal Commission on theCivil Service.PART III(A) Numbers of Staff Abroad36. There are many reasons why the numbers of Foreign Service staffabroad have increased substantially since before the War and any comparison between pre-War and post-War figures is apt to be misleading. The foreign service has assumed many new functions and responsibilities. For example,since the War, information work has become an integral part of the ForeignServiced activities. The economic and commercial work of the foreign service has been considerably expanded. The development of international organisations (U.N., N.A.T.O., Council of Europe, &amp;c.) has necessitated theestablishment of six permanent delegations to such organisations. diplomatic relations are maintained with sixty-seven foreign countries as compared withfifty-three before the War and this means that there are fourteen more diplo-matic missions. There are two new regional offices, that of the CommissionerGeneral in South-East Asia and the British Middle East Office. The ForeignOffice has also taken over from the former Government of India responsibilityfor representation in the Persian Gulf and in view of the importance ofthis area, the staff there has had to be substantially increased. The Warbrought home the need for strict and expanded security measures to guard against leakage of information. This has led not only to the establishmentof a Security Department in the Foreign Office but to the provision ofChancery- Guards from the United Kingdom to serve at overseas Missions.37. The existence of international organisations such as the united nations in no way relieves the burden on Her Majesty&apos;s Missions but addsto their work, since the views of every member of the United Nations onany subject which may be under discussion by that body are of importanceto Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Thus, generally speaking, the conduct ofour foreign relations has become substantially more complicated since theWar. Other factors which have tended to increase staffs abroad are thedevelopment of new communications techniques, the introduction of a
medical scheme and other welfare arrangements, and the increased com-complexity of administration, particularly in Iron Curtain and other posts whereliving conditions are difficult. In the circumstances the increases whichhave taken place in total Foreign Service staff abroad since 1938 are not surprising. They have been largely In the junior and less highly-paid grades.The senior branch of the Foreign Service now totals only 790. In 1938the equivalent services, he., Foreign Office and Diplomatic, Consular, and commercial Diplomatic, totalled 664.38. As the Committee were informed, in the last four years total numbers abroad have been reduced by about 20 per cent. Tables 1 to 6(paragraphs 19-24) of the Report give particulars of some of the reductionseffected. The table in paragraph 30, however, giving figures for the numberof officials serving abroad in a representative capacity in the years 1953-54and 1954-55 is incorrect in that, while the figures for 1954-55 includeGermany, those for 1953-54 do not. The correct total for 1953-54 istherefore not 813 but 933. This means that far from there having been anincrease of almost 7 per cent, in the number of staff serving abroad in arepresentative capacity, there has been a decrease of almost 7 per cent. (this table was not supplied by or checked with any Government Department.)Table 7 (paragraph 24) which is constructed from information supplied by theForeign Office, is also misleading in the absence of any explanatory comment.The figures given for &quot; diplomatic &quot; staff in this table include all those whoare not specifically commercial, consular, or information, e.g., registry staff,cyphering staff and staff engaged on administrative duties of all kinds. Thefigure of ninety-five given for post-war &quot; diplomatic &quot; staff in Paris, includesfifty-one local staff, the majority of whom are employed in a relatively juniorcapacity (telephone operators, messengers, drivers, &amp;c). This figure also includes the staff engaged in providing common services for the UnitedKingdom Delegation to N.A.T.O. and the O.E.E.C. The post-war figure forRome also includes thirty-four local staff (as opposed to six in 1939), whosenumbers are swollen owing to the present geographical separation of different departments of the Embassy. The post-war figures for diplomatic staff in eachcase includes Security Guards (seven in Rome, nine in Ankara, &amp;c), acategory which as explained above, did not exist before the War but whichhas unfortunately been shown to be necessary. The figure for informationstaff in Washington may appear low but this is because the main headquarters of the British Information Services in the United States are in New York.39. The Report suggests in paragraph 20 that such reductions in staff as have been achieved are due almost entirely to a curtailment or sometimescomplete abolition of specific functions or &quot; blocks of work &quot; rather than toa careful and systematic pruning of staff at all levels. While it is true thatmajor reductionsxhave as a general rule only been possible where functionshave been reduced or abolished, the large economies achieved in 1951 and1953 were distributed throughout the Service and involved cuts at all levels.Moreover the process of &quot; careful and systematic pruning of staff at all levels &quot;continues all the time and is one of the main functions of the Inspectors.If they had not been so successful in this work of pruning, the total figuresof Foreign Service staff abroad would inevitably have risen in view of the new commitments taken on by the Foreign Service in recent years.40. Any further large reduction could only be achieved by eliminating ordrastically reducing some particular function at some or all Foreign Serviceposts. For example, the commercial departments at a number of posts might conceivably be abolished. The total cost of the commercial side of theForeign Service is approximately  1 million.   At this cost the Foreign Office
is provided with essential economic information and British firms are givenconsiderable assistance in the development of exports. It is not possible to evaluate the services to British trade which Commercial Officers are ableto render. In view, however, of the vital importance to the country ofmaintaining and developing British exports it would be a false economy toimpose an arbitrary cut in our commercial representation in foreign countries.Similarly, it would no doubt be possible to abolish some of the InformationDepartments at Her Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad (the total cost of the staff engaged on information work is approximately  l-  million). The value of thework performed by the Information Service has, however, been criticallyexamined by the Drogheda Committee, whose conclusion was that we should seek to expand our efforts in this field.(B) The Foreign Service Inspectorate41. The Committee&apos;s Report states (paragraph 17) that &quot;four of the inspectors including the Senior Inspector, had only had experience of consularposts.&quot; In fact, however, all six Inspectors had had experience of diplomatic-posts. Appendix 20 dealing with the careers of the Inspectors was notsupplied by or checked with the Foreign Office and contains a number oferrors, e.g., &quot; Consul &quot; where it should read &quot; Counsellor &quot; and &quot; CommercialConsul &quot; where it should read &quot; Commercial Counsellor.&quot;42. In paragraph 63 of the Report, the Committee expressed the viewthat the Inspectors &quot; who are constantly changing in the normal run ofbusiness cannot gain that complete experience over the whole field which isdesirable for the most efficient discharge of their duties.&quot; A foreign service Inspector starts with the advantage of fifteen to twenty years&apos;knowledge of Foreign Service work and after a few months&apos; training under one of the more experienced Inspectors should know his duties. Itshould be noted that the Inspectors ordinarily go on to fill normal foreign service posts and the experience they have gained as Inspectors stands themin good stead.43. The Committee drew attention to the cost of the Inspectorate which is 34,712 per annum. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that this costis more than recovered in terms of savings, better organisation and the generalefficiency of the Service, resulting from the Inspection system. It is perhapsworth pointing out that it takes an experienced Foreign Service Inspectoiat least a month to complete his examination of an average Embassy. Bythe end of that time he has usually amassed enough information about localcosts and local requirements to be able to assess what allowances arenecessary and also to make recommendations about the number of staff required. &quot;Any less thorough examination would be liable to lead toerroneous conclusions.(C) Allowances for Foreign Service Staff AbroadGeneral44. The general assumptions on which the present system of allowancesis based are described in Foreign Service Regulations (No. 3, Chapter 2)as follows:  &quot; Salary is intended to cover necessary expenditure in the UnitedKingdom and to take the first strain of the cost of living of the officerabroad, foreign allowances supplementing it to the extent to which the: salary falls short of total necessary expenditure. In assessing foreignallowances, the following items inter alia are taken into account: . (a) local
cost of living; (6) expenditure which an officer serving abroad necessarilyincurs, either at home or abroad, over and above that of an officer of corresponding grade serving in the Foreign Office; and (c) representationalexpenditure, i.e., expenditure which, while optional for a private individual,is obligatory for a member of the Foreign Service resident abroad by virtueof his official position.&quot;45. The present system was devised in 1947, in agreement with theTreasury, with the following aims:  (a) to assess necessary expenditure at particular posts in the light of the rank, function and marital status of the officer;(b) to provide sufficient personal emoluments to attract the best type ofcandidate, whether or not he possesses private means, in accordancewith the principles enunciated in the White Paper on the Reform ofthe Foreign Service (Cmd. 6420 of 1943);(c) to provide a standard basis of personal emolument, irrespective ofthe conditions of the particular post at which an officer is serving;(d) to make reasonable provision for children, whether resident with theofficer or at school in this country.46. A system to achieve these aims must necessarily be complicated. Asimpler system which worked on the basis of broad assumptions, e.g., thata married couple of a certain age would have a certain number of children,would be unsatisfactory. The extremes of cost of living, measured in sterling,found at posts abroad make it necessary to have a close and detailed assessment of every item of local expenditure if allowances are not to be excessive in one post and inadequate in another. This local expenditure canonly be assessed after examination on the spot by an inspector who iscompetent to judge local conditions and the functions and requirements ofthe particular post. The Inspector must take account of the fact that anyoneliving temporarily in a foreign country inevitably incurs higher living expensesthan the permanent resident. Some element of personal emolument is necessarily included in this assessment, e.g., in providing for local leave,recreations, &amp;c. The aim of the Inspector is to apply a common standardin these matters and the Foreign Office intend to carry this process ofstandardising as far as conditions permit. As officers abroad incurexpenditure in both sterling and local currency for items of local consumption,the Inspector must also assess these sterling items. As is indicated in theForeign Service Regulation quoted above, the first strain of the cost of living of the officer abroad is taken by salary which is supplemented as necessary by foreign allowances. In calculating the total required, an element is leftwhich is called the &quot; unallocated margin &quot; and which is fixed in relation tothe rank and ^marital status of the officer. For example, the most juniorsingle officer receives about  36 and a married Grade I Ambassador  970.This margin is intended to cover unforeseen expenses, expenditure on childrennot otherwise covered, expenditure on dependent relatives or other privatecommitments, savings, insurance, &amp;c. It is necessary in this connexion totake into account the following factors:  (a) the liability to serve at posts abroad, many of which are unhealthy,unpleasant, distant or lonely;(b) dangers to health due to service in a variety of climates;(c) liability to frequent transfer, whether to this country or to other postsabroad, and the consequent inconveniences and expense of aperipatetic life;(d) prolonged separation from families and the consequent problem ofchildren&apos;s education.
47. The above factors apply equally to all grades of staff. Any largebusiness or other organisation employing staff overseas must take such considerations into account.48. In assessing the necessary expenditure of representational staff the inspector naturally has to concern himself with the functions of the officer and with his methods and standard of entertaining. The general system offoreign allowances is based on the assumption that entertaining will be done as far as possible in the officers residence. This is normally both more economical and more effective than entertainment in hotels or restaurants.The officer is therefore provided with a rent allowance to cover the rent of accommodation suitable for entertaining and the Inspector includes in hisassessment of necessary expenditure provision for the cost of a servant orservants.49. Conditions of living in this country are not relevant to the scaleor standard of representation required by the members of the Foreign service abroad. Few people in this country live and entertain on the scale ofa generation ago. There are, however, many foreign capitals wherestandards are as high as or even higher than they were before the War. Itwould be wrong to expect Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad to have ademonstrably lower standard of living and of entertainment than localpersonalities in the political, professional or business world, who may live in the same or in a neighbouring street and with whom he must endeavourto establish friendly relations. Factors which must clearly be taken intoaccount in considering the standards to be maintained by british representatives are the need to maintain British prestige and influence, toexplain and defend British policies and to promote British exports. the standards maintained by the representatives of other Power are also relevant.50. It is stated in paragraph 33 of the Report that the Foreign service officers&apos; &quot; own cost of riving, most of their own clothes, their amusementswhen at post, their local leaves and part of the cost of the education of their children are met by the foreign and education allowances which are designedexpressly for the purpose.&quot; There are also numerous references to theprovision of &quot; tax-free allowances &quot; for various specific items of expenditure,e.g., clothes, drinks, cars, &amp;c. None of these statements is strictly accurate.In the first place the foreign allowance is comprehensive. Secondly, as was explained in evidence, the whole of an officers salary after deduction ofUnited Kingdom income tax and after setting aside a proportion for privatecommitments (i.e., the &quot; unallocated margin&apos;&quot; referred to in paragraph 46above) is reckoned to be devoted to meeting the officer&apos;s living expenses athis post. The officer is never expected to be able to live on his allowancealone and if he is doing his job certainly cannot do so. The various itemsfor which provision has to be made are therefore based on the estimated average expenditure of an officer of a given grade at the post in questionwhich has to be met first by salary and then (to the extent that this is not sufficient) by a comprehensive foreign allowance.51. One of the main purposes of the proposals in the White Paper of1943 (Cmd. 6420) was to widen the field of recruitment to the Foreign Service.It followed from this that officers should be enabled to live whether at home or abroad, without recourse to private means. The White Paper also statedthat &quot; Officers serving abroad must be ensured emoluments sufficient toenable them not only to represent this country effectively but also to forma wide range of contacts.&quot;52. As was explained to the Committee by both Treasury and ForeignOffice witnesses, the allowances payable abroad have to be looked at
primarily in terms of the goods and services which the recipient can purchasewith them at the post concerned. Owing to the very high cost of living inmany foreign countries and to the unrealistic exchange rates prevailing insome, the allowances when quoted in sterling may sound fantastic. Themost glaring example of this is, of course, Moscow. It is, however, veryquestionable whether the shorthand-typist receiving the equivalent of  4,000per annum in Moscow is &quot; living more comfortably&quot; than her colleague-receiving  400 per annum in London. She certainly lacks many of the amenities which the latter can enjoy.Heads of Missions53. The amount of the frais or allowances of Heads of Missions is governed to a considerable extent by the size and nature of the officialresidence. This in effect dictates the amount which has to be spent onheating, light, servants, upkeep of garden, &amp;c. A number of other items such as the running expenses of a car, chauffeur&apos;s wages, &amp;c,offer equally limited scope for economy. The other major items ofexpenditure, e.g., the cost of food and drink, depend largely on the amountof entertaining which is necessary. This will vary very much from post to post and will depend partly on such factors as the frequency of visits by-United Kingdom Ministers or other important persons (including Membersof Parliament), most of whom rightly expect a Head of Mission to make thenecessary arrangements for them to meet local personalities. These arrange-ments usually involve large dinner or cocktail parties. Such visits, whilemost valuable and welcome to Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad,inevitably increase their expenditure on overheads as well as on actualentertainment. Other factors which have to be taken into account in determining the extent of necessary entertainment at a given post are thegeneral relations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government with the Government of thecountry concerned, the importance which is attached to developing contacts with local political or business personalities, the nature and extent of thehospitality which the Head of Mission receives and may be obliged to return,the size of the local British community, &amp;c.Food, Drink and Tobacco54. When commenting on the examination of budgets by the Inspectors,the Report states (paragraph 39):  &quot; Vouchers are not insisted upon but produced whenever possible,although they are not produced in respect of food and drink which constitutes by^far the largest item of expenditure in every model budget.&quot;This statement is misleading. In the reply to Question 681 it was explainedthat in the examination of budgets expenditure on food was checked by reference to housekeeping or cooks&apos; books so far as possible and by study oflocal market prices. The expenditure on drink is also verified by theproduction of receipts.55. The Report comments (paragraph 44) on the provision made fordrinks and cigarettes and draws attention to the fact that all senior and somejunior members of the Foreign Service are able to obtain these free of import duty. This is, of course, taken into account by the Inspectors in assessing the amount which the officer will need to spend on these items. It is therefor of direct advantage to the British taxpayer that the Foreign Service officers should be able to purchase these supplies duty free since the less he hasto pay for them the smaller will be his allowance.
Clothes56. The Committee drew attention to the amount provided for clothing(paragraph 43). Clothes in many foreign countries are more expensive thanin the United Kingdom, while at many posts both tropical and normal winterclothes are required. Moreover, foreigners expect a high standard to bemaintained by Heads of Mission and the more senior members of their staffs and their wives. There is no foundation for the figure quoted inparagraph 43 of the Report, for the amount which an Ambassador might receive if he were a single man. The highest assessment for any singleAmbassador of the highest grade is not  450 but  225.Cars57. The Committee comment (paragraphs 45 and 46) on the provision made in the foreign allowances for transport and on the advances made tofacilitate the purchase of cars. The Foreign Office system is very similar tothat described to the Committee by a representative of LCI. The Committeeexpress surprise that the provision made for a comparatively junior marriedofficer with representational duties Q.e., one who must be presumed to need a car for the efficient performance of his work) should be  100 per annum for running expenses, in addition to  95 for depreciation. The sum of  100per annum in respect of running expenses, i.e., petrol, oil, repairs,insurance, &amp;c, might not be regarded as unreasonable even in this countryand it should be remembered that while the officers petrol may cost him lessabroad, he will have to pay much larger sums in respect of insurance, andthat repairs are normally also more expensive. Since paragraph 41 (4) mightbe taken to mean that provision is made for the depreciation of a car in the allowances of all grades, it is perhaps desirable to point out that only themore senior members of the staff (normally First Secretary and above) areeligible for such an allowance.Married Allowances58. In paragraph 47 the Report states that it is not clear on what basis the additional allowance in respect of a wife is fixed or to what extent this allowance takes into account the help she may give her husband in his job,if it is a job with, representational duties. The answer is that the marriedallowance is larger that the single allowance only to the extent that a married couple will have to spend more on food, drink, clothes, &amp;c, than a singleman or woman. No account is taken in calculating allowances of the help which a wife gives to her husband in the performance of his representationalduties (which is, of course, normally very substantial).Childreris Allowances59. The additions to Foreign Allowances for children are intended as a contribution towards the cost of maintaining a child, whether resident with theofficer or at school in this country. These allowances are not calculated tocbver the whole cost and do not in fact do so. The officer must make up thedifference from the balance of his salary \i.e., the unallocated margin seeparagraph 46 above). When their children are at school in this countryofficers serving abroad are faced with a very serious problem in providingnot only for school fees, clothes, &amp;c, but also for maintenance during the holidays. As the Committee were informed, parents who get their childrenout to join them at the post during the school holidays have to pay their passages.
Non-Representational Staff60. As was stated in evidence, the allowances of all members of staffsabroad who have no representational obligations, are basically cost-of-livingallowances and are such as any good employer would expect to have to pay to expatriate staff in the country concerned. The allowances are fixed after careful scrutiny of budgets by the Foreign Office Inspectors who take every opportunity to consult responsible local British representatives about the allowances payable to members of their staff with comparable functions.61. The Committee comment that a Foreign Service officer receives a tax-free allowance corresponding to the total rent which he has to pay forhis accommodation &quot; however high that rent may be &quot; (paragraph 32). they also comment that under the existing system an officer &quot; however junior andinexperienced &quot; can select his own accommodation. These comments are not justified. Since the end of the War there has been an acute shortage of accommodation in almost every large city in the world and this hasinevitably meant that rents, particularly furnished rents, have been very high.Where there is a stable economy, e.g., in the United States, rent ceilings forthe different grades of staff are in force. Elsewhere the individual mustobtain the approval of the Head of the Post for the rent which he is proposing to pay. This in turn has to be approved by the Foreign Office, who,where appropriate, draw on the expert advice of the Ministry of Works.Finally, the Inspectors make a point of enauiring into standards of accommodation and if they thought that an individual was paying an excessive rent, and could obtain suitable accommodation at a more reasonablefigure, would not hesitate to recommend him to move unless he is himselfprepared to pay part of the rent. There are thus three successive checks onthe rents paid.62. The Committee quote (paragraph 52) &quot; as an illustration of the unsatisfactory nature of the present system &quot; the amount which was being paid for accommodation for a telephonist in Paris ( 245 per annum). As was explained to them, however, (Question 774 and Appendix 9), this onlysecured a furnished bed-sitting room.63. The Foreign Office nevertheless propose to send out fresh instructionsto all posts, charging them to make further efforts to secure economies in expenditure on rents and, in particular, to ensure that all possible help isgiven to new arrivals at the post to find suitable accommodation at areasonable figure.64. The Committee expressed the view (paragraph 79) that it does notappear probable that substantial economies in the Foreign Service are likelyto materialise automatically from within the Service itself. They also referred in paragraph 81 to the &quot;ever increasing expenditure&quot; incurred inforeign territories. The total expenditure on the Foreign Service (includingstaff in Germany and all allied services-Works, Stationery and Printing,Telegram and Telephone service &amp;c.) in each of the last four years has been as follows:  (D) Rent Allowances(E) Conclusion1950-511951-521952-531953-54 22,060,000 20,115,000 18,735,000 18,405,000
65. While this reduction has been in large part due to diminishingobligations in Germany, nevertheless this has been a period of almostuniversally rising costs and the commitments of the Foreign Service haveincreased substantially elsewhere (the formation of a United kingdom delegation to N.A.T.O., increased staff in the Persian Gulf, increasedcommercial staffs at a number of posts to help in trade promotion, &amp;c). Itcan, therefore, confidently be said that if the Foreign Service had not been administered with constant regard for economy, the costs would indeed havebeen &quot; ever increasing,&quot; whereas in fact they have been substantially reduced.
