secret ^(55) 27 COPY NO.28th January, 1955CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON tariffs and trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 24th January, the Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary andthe other Ministers principally concerned to consider further this difficult problem of our attitude to Japanls accession to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) (C.C.(55) 6th Conclusions, Minute 4),  Annexedis a short note which describes a course of action which we might pursue.My colleagues have agreed that I should put this forward to the Cabinet asa basis for discussion, and without commitment.2. Action on these lines would still leave us with one real source of difficulty with Lancashire.    The decision to offer Japan most-favoured-nation rijhts on tariffs would be regarded by Lancashire - and indeed by industry in general - as an important concession to the Japanese.    In orderto defend this step forward in our commercial relations with Japan, wewould have to be in a position to say that we intended to take powers toimpose countervailing duties against dumped goods within the same limitsas are permitted by the G.A.T.T.3. There remains the problem of the timing of any statement ofpolicy.    It would seem probable that some discussion in Parliament will inevitably follow upon the end of the G. A. T. T. . Review negotiations, andit is. difficult to see how we could avoid making some statement upon theJapanese issue at that stage.    This, however, is a complex matter and islinked with the Trade and Payments talks. I suggest that we should instructofficials to examine the matter and report back.Pa TmBoard of Trade, S.W.1,28th January, 1955.
JAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREE MSN T ON tariffs and trade we should invoke Article XXXV.    When announcing this, weshould explain that we did it because we could not yet give up the safe-guards for our industries which we should not have if we were to acceptat this time G.A.T.T, obligations towards Japan,    We should point outthat international trade was going through a period of alteration andadjustment and we wanted to see how the trade pattern would develop beforeaccepting such obligations.    We should make it clear that it was the aim ofthe United Kingdom Government that all nations should be equally subjectto trade rules, and that it was our intention that our trade relations shouldbe so conducted as to reach a situation in which we could accept in due course G,A,T.T.. obligations towards Japan,    Furthermore, it was in ourmutual interest to maintain a high level of trade between the sterling area and Japan, and we considered that this aim could best be achieved bythe continuation of the Trade and Payments Agreements,    These Agree-ments would in general continue to determine to what extent the UnitedKingdom should use quota restrictions.    In addition, we should offer tonegotiate a commercial treaty with Japan whereby, in return forsatisfactory shipping and establishment provisions, and for assurances inregard to copying and unfair trade practices, we should undertake tocontinue to give Japan most-favouredonation treatment on tariffs.
