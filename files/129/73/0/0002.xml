Printed for the Cabinet. January 1955SECRET Copy NoC. (55) 26th January, 1955. 69CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Minister of works in his memorandum C. (54) 393 the Prime Minister has suggested stoppingwork on the new Colonial Office. It may be helpful if I set out the consequences of doing so.2. The consequences of abandoning the present building scheme and layingout the site as an open space are as follows:  (i) The Public Offices (Site) Act, 1947, authorised the acquisition of the site of the old Westminster Hospital for the purpose of building public offices, and money was voted by Parliament on that basis. legislation would be necessary to authorise the use of the site for other purposes.(ii) The site and accommodation below ground represent an investment ofabout  1-45 million. It would cost about another  50,000 to lay outthe site as an open space.(iii) If we are to ensure that the whole area, from the Central Hall,Westminster, to the Houses of Parliament, and from Great george street to Westminster Abbey can become an open space, legislation will be necessary. I have no powers to acquire and hold land for use as an open space. In any case we should have to face opposition fromthe present owners, and compulsory acquisition of at least some of thebuildings is likely to be necessary.  The buildings are:The Middlesex Guildhall,The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,No.   10   Great   George   Street,   owned   by   the   ChurchCommissioners and leased to Middlesex County Council,The Institution of Civil Engineers.I estimate that it would cost  44-5 millions to acquire theseproperties and compensate the owners.3.   All the properties apart from that belonging to the Chartered Surveyorshave a long useful life remaining.4. The Chartered Surveyors are planning to rebuild on the present site.If this is to be prevented a fairly early disclosure of the intention to create agreater Parliament Square will be necessary.5. The Colonial Office needs a new headquarters and there are few sites onwhich a suitable office can be built.   The following have been considered:  (i) Richmond Terrace. We shall have to rebuild this sooner or later.   a building to modern planning standards would provide for at most1,000 people as against 1,150 required by the Colonial Office.   this could not be ready in less than 5 years.47443
(ii) Horsejerry Road. A new building has been started here, but has only-reached ground floor level. It has not been designed as a Ministerialbuilding, but it would be large enough for the Colonial Office. Someinternal modifications of the plans would be necessary but these couldbe made in time to start work in a year and a half. The building could: then be ready about 1959.(iii) Great Peter Street. We are in process of acquiring the remainder of the site between the Horseferry Road building and Great Peter Street.This site will take a building holding about 3,000 people and it would therefore be possible to construct a Colonial Office as part of thescheme.   This could not be ready in less than 5 years.(iv) Carlton House Terrace. When this was discussed by the Cabinet(C.C. (54) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5) the proposal was to reconstructCarlton House Terrace for the Foreign Office and the question wasremitted to a Cabinet Committee which has not yet met. If the Terraceis reconstructed as planned, it would be possible to accommodate theexisting staffs of the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth relations office. Working drawings for the west block have been completed,but a good deal of preparatory work still needs to be done. Also,before building can start we need legislation to acquire land for access to the proposed underground car park, and there are still leaseholdersoccupying some of the houses, e.g., the Savage Club who will haveto be forced out or bought out by agreement. We could not thereforecount on starting rebuilding for some considerable time. The block west of Duke of York Steps would be ready in about 3^ years from thetime of starting work. The east block which must be kept in usewhile the west block is reconstructed would be ready 3 years later.6. If Carlton House Terrace was given to the Colonial Office and theCommonwealth Relations Office, some of the Foreign Office staff now there couldbe put in the Downing Street block and the rest in another building nearby,possibly a rebuilt Richmond Terrace.N.

Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1955SECRET Copy No.     gC. (55) 310th January, 1955CABINETPARTY POLITICAL BROADCASTING IN wales memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe National Broadcasting Council for Wales, which was set up under theB.B.C. Charter, say they propose to allow time in the Welsh Home Service forparty political broadcasts on Welsh affairs. Their idea is that each Party whichput up a minimum of three candidates at the last General Election should nominatespeakers to broadcast for 15 minutes every six months. They would deal withWelsh affairs only, that is matters which can be discussed in the Welsh Debate inthe House of Commons, not excluding questions which would involve legislation.The Council have acted on their own initiative without reference to me, as theyare entitled to do.2. Under Clause 12 (4) (a) of the B.B.C. Charter it is the CounciFs duty tocontrol &quot; the policy and the content of the programmes of that service .... whichthe Corporation provides primarily for reception in the country for which theCouncil are established, and exercising such control with full regard to the distinctive culture, interests and tastes of ... . that country.&quot; The B.B.C. takethe view that it is not unreasonable for the Council to want some political broadcasts on purely Welsh affairs in view of their duties under the Charter.3. The B.B.C. are certain the Council would not drop their scheme as a resultof any informal pressure even if they were told that, should they not withdraw, Iwould issue a formal ban under Clause 15 (4) of the B.B.C. Licence. They say alsothat the whole of the Welsh Council would resign if such a ban were imposed.4..\ The Councils proposal would, I understand, mean that the Conservative,Labour,\Liberal and Welsh Nationalist Parties would each have a quarter of an hour every six months. This arrangement, with the present distribution of WelshMembers in Parliament, would of course actually favour us as against the LabourParty. It would, however, bring in the Welsh Nationalist Party and would thusintroduce a specially dangerous precedent.5. The CounciFs proposal, even if it were restricted to Parties having three or more Members of Parliament (as distinct from candidates) would introduce a serious precedent which might be followed in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Incidentally, even if the initial arrangements were quite unobjectionable theNational Councils might well want to change them later and for something reallyobjectionable. In fact this proposal means that a regional Council would have more control over party political broadcasting in its area than is at present exercised by the B.B.C. nationally.6. On the other hand, there is strong feeling in Wales on this subject andthere is a virtual certainty of a serious political blow-up if the present proposals is banned.7. Whatever view we may adopt, we should presumably have to consult the Opposition and possibly the Liberal Party. I gather that the Welsh sectionsof the various Parties have not consulted their Headquarters, but that at a national level the Labour Party is likely to be as disturbed by the proposal as we are.47457
.    2i8. A ban could be imposed either by direction by me to the BBiC. underSection 15 (4) of their Licence, or by altering the B.B.C. Charter with the authorityof the whole of Parliament. The B.B.C. has no power to direct the Council onthis point.9. I have delayed circulating this paper until I could discuss the matter with both the B.B.C. and Lord Macdonald, Chairman of the Welsh Council; LordMacdonald has now agreed that the Council will not take a final decision at its next meeting, and that he would be prepared to discuss the question with party leaders early in February.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,6th January, 19551\
