POLICE CADETS AND NATIONAL service memorandum by the Minister of DefenceThere is a serious shortage of police, particularly in the Metropolitan police district. For some time, not nearly enough recruits have&apos; been enrolled, andrecently not enough recruits have been taken into the Metropolitan Police force to replace wastage.2. The male establishment of this Force is 19,696, and the present deficiencyis over 4,000. On the basis of the estimated rate of wastage there are likely by themiddle of ] 958 to be about 5,000 vacancies. The position is even worse than thesefigures suggest, since the Metropolitan Police Force, unlike other Police Forces,has had no increase of the ordinary establishment, such as would be justified bythe new work put on the police. In order to fulfil its duties, the establishmentof the Force should be increased to about 22,500, so that the real deficiency by 1958will be about 8,000. These figures speak for themselves.    ,     :3. The position is also serious in a number of large industrial cities,, includingBirmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester.4. The recent pay increases resulted in an increase in the number of applica-tions to join the police, but have produced few suitable recruits. On the otherhand, there is no shortage of good candidates for appointment as police cadets,who are enrolled at age 16 or 17 and are employed on ancillary police work until they are called up for national service. Unfortunately, a fair proportion of thesecadets have not so far returned to the police on completion of their national service.5. The Home Secretary accordingly proposes that a satisfactory police cadetshould not be called up. On reaching the age of 19 he would be taken into theregular police force and his call-up would remain deferred so long as he continuedto serve in such a force. The numbers concerned would not be large. About1,200 cadets a year would be recruited to the Metropolitan Police at any time before they are actually called up to the Forces and a smaller number to theprovincial forces in England and Wales.6.  The Home Secretary justifies his proposal on the following grounds:  (a) The preservation of law and order is fundamental to the life of thecommunity, in a sense which is not applicable even to such an essentialservice as underground coal-mining, which now enjoys indefinitedeferment from call-up.(b) In war, the more efficient and up to strength the police are, the less willbe the need to divert the armed forces from their normal functions. for the purpose of aiding the civil power. It is also of the first importance that in dealing with the results of attacks with thermo-nuclear weapons the police forces should be as adequate and as highly trained as possible.7. I have discussed this matter with the Home Secretary, the Minister ofLabour and National Service and the Service Ministers. We are agreed that,merely from the point of view of numbers, to defer about 2,000 police cadets ayear would.create no difficulties for the Services.47678fe ;:*!^!&apos;::.;:;. &apos; &apos; v -^Printed for the Cabinet: ;February 1955  -3y    &apos; V\. &apos;Yus tot toarmlsb srimtebfis lo noiftuhotfni mi* Zuti r:oot3fbaTi yd l&amp;3^ayoj5 woif^F *&quot;SECRET        jtiH ni        vlfjiuivan; Copy No.    7C (55) 49      Si WO .&apos; ;v.r- V&apos; ;,: ml ta^itr.iSih February, 1955[ , J^fJ&apos;CABINET
Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,:;: h 17th February, 1955.18. The Minister of Labour and National Service is, however, apprehensive of the serious&apos; implications $hp-ifuUji^be^-M \tbe established principle ofuniversality of national service involved in the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal.Indefinite deferment for underground Coal-mihers and merchant navy personnelis now accepted by tradition, but the introduction of indefinite deferment for any$jeshse^egory such as police cadets would inevitably lead, in his view,&quot;tostrongpressure for similar concessions in other directions, notably in respect of all men employed in agriculture. For these reasons, he is of the view that police :cadetsshould continue to perform their full-time national service,- and ^that-if ^any concession has to be made it should not go further than reducing their&quot; period&apos;ofservice to, say, eighteen months.9. The Service Ministers and I consider it essential to maintain the principleof universality of length of service under the National Service Acts, and to avoidintroducing differing periods of full-time service for different categories of men.A solution cannot therefore be found in calling up police cadets for a shortenedterm of nationalService; Although we appreciate the strength of the arguments advanced by the Minister of Labour we see less objection to the grant of indefinitedeferment to a very-special category of men whose occupation is so vital to the life of the community as to make it desirable that they should not be called upso^long as-they remain in that occupation. We think that there is force in theHome.Secretary&apos;s view that police cadets satisfy this criterion, particularly whenit is borne in mind that the police are a disciplined force, calling for intensivetraining and with inconvenient and arduous hours of duty.        -&apos; -vv .10. I ask my colleagues to decide whether police cadets covered by the Home$ecretary&apos;s. proposal should be granted indefinite deferment from call-up underthe National Service Acts. . -.   &quot; -Y &apos;- , . j H.
