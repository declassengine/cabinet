secret.(55) 22 COPY NO.24th January, 1955CABINETCLEAN AIR policy memorandum by the Minister cf Fuel and power the clean air policy proposed in the Beaver Report depends forits success on adequate supplies of smokeless fuel.    I am satisfied thatit is feasible, without damaging industry, to provide progressively for the substantial increase in the quantities of smokeless fuels which this policyrequires.2. The smokeless fuels available are gas, electricity, coke, oil,smokeless coal and manufactured fuels.    In the normal course of eventssupplies of all these fuels will increase.    The current development plans of the gas and electricity industries, for example, provide for considerably increased supplies in coming years and are in line with the demand forthese two fuels that a clean air policy would create.    Similarly more oil,coke and other solid smokeless fuels will be available.    The creation ofsmokeless zones will therefore harmonise, not clash, with the naturaltrend of smokeless fuel supplies.3. Apart from gas and electricity, coke is by far the mostimportant of the smokeless fuels.    Here long-term developments arealready under way which will powerfully reinforce the present trend towards increased supplies of coke.    Gas coke has normally been produced by gasifying the special carbonisation coals on which the gas industry has depended from its earliest days.    These coals are scarceand in keen demand.    Recently, therefore, the gas industry has beenexperimenting with techniques for making gas and coke from other coalsand these experiments have already had some success.    I am confident that as a result we shall progressively have more ample supplies ofcoal for making gas and coke.    Again, the industry is installing severalplants which make gas direct from oil and so lessen the need to use cokein the manufacture of water gas;  and it is extending the use of low-gradecoal in place of coke for the heating of retorts.4. Thus, over the 10-15 years which the Beaver Committeeenvisaged as the time it would take it to put a clean air policy into full effect, the natural trend of smokeless fuel supplies and the new techniquesnow being developed will, I believe, assure us of the supplies that will be needed for the smokeless zones.5. Over the next 5 years (the period on which the BeaverCommittee thought it right to concentrate) the rate of solid smokelessfuel production is expected to increase by about \ million tons a year,or 2 million tons in all.    It would be unsafe, I suggest, to be content with this increase.    If we are to ensure enough smokeless fuel in these
early years to match an energetic policy of creating smokeless zones andsmoke-control areas, we should secure about another 2 million tons 8    &quot;Wecan make this insurance, but only by diverting that amount from, otherusers.6. 7 million tons of gas coke are consumed each year by non-domestic users.    Of this, Z\ million tons go to public buildings (Govern-ment, Local Authorities, etc .) for central heating.    I believe that fromthis Z\ million tons we can secure (as recommended by the BeaverCommittee) a big contribution to the supplies of gas coke needed for thesmokeless zones and oil can be used to take its place.7. Oil is already displacing solid fuel for central heating, for reasons both of convenience and cheapness.    This is an encouraging trendand one that is in line with my policy of relieving the strain on coal supplies by the increased use of oil which the Cabinet approved inprinciple on 2nd June, 1954 (C, C. (54) 37th Conclusions, Minute 6).    A cleanair policy would increase the need to encourage this trend, and I shallshortly ask my colleagues to approve, among other measures for extending the use of oil, a proposal for substituting, over the next 2 years^ oil for1 million tons of coke now used for heating public buildings.To sum up:-supplies of all kinds of smokeless fuel are increasing andon present tendencies will continue to increase through-out the period of 10-15 years in which the clean air policy proposed will gradually become effective jthis natural increase in supplies will be reinforcedprogressively throughout the period by various new developments in the tecchniques of gas and cokemaking;over the next 5 years a deliberate policy of substitutingoil for coke, particularly in public buildings, will ensure sufficient smokeless fuel to match the needsof smokeless zones and smoke control areas createdduring the period.8.(i)(ii)(Hi)g.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.
