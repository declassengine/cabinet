(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret(55) 2829th January,1955BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationAlthough the latter paragraphs of the Final Report of the Courtof Inquiry might be read as recommending a general inquiry into british railways (or indeed the Transport Commission) as a v/hole, I do not think there is any reason to suggest any modification of the Cabinet&apos;s tentativeconclusion to the contrary (C.C.(55) 6th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. Such an inquiry would hold up re-organisation which is nowat a crucial stage.    It is opposed both by the Commission and by the Unions.3. There is, however, both a strong body of public opinion whichexpects some inquiry to be made, and reason to believe that there is somewaste in the use of manpower by the Commission.4. There is, therefore, a reasonable case for an inquiry limitedto the use of manpower by the Commission.5. Sir Brian Robertson, Chairman of the British transport commission, has informed us that the Commission would be willing tosuggest to the Unions that they should undertake a joint inquiry into theuse of manpower on the railways.    The proposal would include thesuggestion that outside assistance be obtained and that reports should bepublished from time to time.6. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour believes that the Unions might respond to such a suggestion.7. Sir Brian Robertson is, therefore, approaching the Unionswith a proposal to this effect.8, If agreement can be obtained for an inquiry on these lines, i recommend that an indication of the approval of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto this course of action be given at an early stage to Parliament.J.A.B.-C.Miinistry of Transport and Civil Aviation,W.l.COPY NO,CABINET28th January, 1955
