(55) 8th Conclusion, Minute 2).A.E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.,10th February, 1955.JURIDICAL ASPECTS OF THE FORMOSA SITUATIONFormosa and the Pescadores1. Formosa and the Pescadores were ceded to Japan by China in the peace treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. The validity of this cession can hardly becontested. The Cairo Declaration of December, 1943, with its reference toFormosa as one of the territories which Japan had &quot; stolen from the Chinese &quot;was a retrospective moral condemnation of an international transaction which, atthe time and long afterwards, was never questioned as being in any way contrary to international law.2: In the Cairo Declaration, the Allies stated that it was their purpose &quot; thatall the territories which Japan has stolen from China, such ss .... x orrnoss andthe Pescadores shall be restored to the Republic of China.....&quot; This declaration was simply a statement of intention that Formosa should be retroceded to Chinaafter the war. This retrocession has in fact never taken place because of thedifficulties arising from the existence of two entities claiming to represent Chinaand the differences among the Powers as to the status of these two entities. the potsdam Declaration of July, 1945, laid down as one of the conditions for theJapanese Peace Treaty that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be carriedout. In September, 1945, the administration of Formosa was taken over from theJapanese by Chinese forces pursuant to the Japanese Instrument of Surrenderand General Order No. 1 issued by the Japanese Government at the directionof the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, dated September 2, 1945. Butthis was not a cession nor did it in itself involve any change of sovereignty. Thearrangements made with Chiang Kai-shek put him there on a basis of militaryoccupancy, responsible to the whole body of the Allies, pending a peace treaty with japan or, if the status of Formosa was not finally settled by that treaty (which itwas not), then pending an eventual settlement about Formosa which has not yettaken place. The arrangements did not of themselves constitute the territoryChinese. In the Japanese Peace Treaty of April, 1952, Japan formally renouncedall right, title and claim to Formosa and the Pescadores, but again this did not operate as a transfer to Chinese sovereignty, whether to the Chinese People&apos;s47648
7th February, 1955.Republic or to the Chinese Nationalist authorities. It has been suggested that theJapanese Peace Treaty meant that the parties to the Peace Treaty, other than Japan,had become co-sovereigns of Formosa. This seems doubtful. The Peace Treatymerely removed Japan&apos;s title without making any alterations in the existing arrangements for its administration.3. Formosa and the Pescadores are, therefore, in the view of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, territory the de jure sovereignty over which is uncertain orundetermined. In the meantime, Her Majesty&apos;s Government do in practicerecognise the Chinese Nationalists as the authority administering Formosa; butthey do not recognise them as the de facto government of Formosa, whether aspart of China or on any other basis, since they do not regard Formosa, as such,as constituting a separate State.4. The logical corollary of our view as to the basis on which the ChineseNationalists occupy Formosa is that although they are entitled to be in Formosa,they exercise a limited authority there. As we do not recognise the Nationalistsas the Government of China, they are not, in our view, entitled to use Formosafor trying to get back into the mainland of China. Their powers in respect of formosa are, or should be, strictly confined to administering Formosa itself andnot using it as a base for outside activities.5. On the future of Formosa, Mr. Morrison when Foreign Secretary in thelate Labour Government, took the line in the House of Commons on May 11,1951, that it had now become &quot; an international problem in which a number ofnations apart from those signatory to the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations are closely concerned &quot; and which could usefully be considered by the United nations at the appropriate time. The Prime Minister said in the House of Commons onFebruary 1 of this year that &quot; the problem of Formosa [had become aninternational problem in which a number of other nations are closely concerned.&quot;The Coastal Islands6. The Nationalist-held islands in close proximity to the China coast are ina different category from Formosa and the Pescadores, since they are undoubtedlyChinese territory and therefore, in our view, part of the territory over which thePeople&apos;s Republic of China is entitled to exercise authority. Any attempt by theGovernment of the People&apos;s Republic of China, however, actually to assert its authority over these islands by force would, in the circumstances peculiar to thecase, give rise to a situation endangering peace and security, which is properlya matter of international concern.
Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955CONFIDENTIALC. (55) 3912th February, 1955cabinetTRANSATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLEMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe&apos; Commercial Cable Company of America (C.C.C.) want to lay a newtransatlantic telegraph cable following the route U.S.A., Nova Scotia,Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland. The cable would give 120 telegraphcircuits. It would cost them about $25 millions of which about $17 millions would be spent in this country on cable and repeaters.2. The probable but undisclosed object of the proposal is to put the C.C.C.in a dominant position as regards transatlantic telegraph traffic in relation toother American external telegraph carriers and to ourselves. The United StatesChiefs of Staff have, however, expressed the opinion that the cable has a definitepotential strategic value; our own Chiefs of Staff have endorsed this view andundertaken that account will be taken of it. There is no backing from the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.3. There are already telegraph cables between this country and the U.S.A.which are owned, and worked at both ends, by two American companies, one ofwhich is the C.C.C.; the licences of these companies to operate here are time-expired. We have limited cable capacity to Canada, but none to the U.S.A. in collaboration with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the canadians we are putting in a new transatlantic telephone cable which should be working by the end of next year: &quot;Although &quot;primarily a telephone cable this willalso give us more telegraph channels to Canada and, if the United StatesGovernment would agree, some to the U.S.A. also. Any chance of using the newtelephone cable for telegraphs to the U.S.A. would be lost if the proposed C.C.C.cable were laid.4. Our present telegraph service to the U.S.A. is by radio which is not reallycompetitive with the American cable system. It is partly because we cannot as yet give such good service, and partly for political reasons, that we have notterminated the time-expired licences of the American companies to operate here.The political reasons are likely to be valid for some time, but clearly we do not want to strengthen the position of the foreign companies. The proposed telegraphcable would do.just that for the C.C.C. We should lose any opportunity tonegotiate for a greater share of the transatlantic telegraph traffic. We shouldhave to continue to rely on radio, or to lease American owned circuits, and might even be finally forced right out of the U.S.A. telegraph business. We shouldimperil our present small profit on this service and forgo the possibility of earning a net annual profit for the sterling area as a whole of about S.\ million.This would be forthcoming if the American carriers ceased their operations in theUnited Kingdom and we had a half share with the Americans in a moderntransatlantic telegraph system such as could be provided over pur telephonecable/. .5. We have to consult our Commonwealth Partners in tea CommonwealthCommunication System before granting any new concessions and they are not- &apos;&quot;. : 47654    . v,&apos; :y&quot;, , &quot;Copy No.     gg
