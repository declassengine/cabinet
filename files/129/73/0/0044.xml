PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLESMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Legislation Committee this morning instructed meto submit to Cabinet the question of the line to be taken on the ContractCarriages and Special Travel Facilities Bill (L0C0(55) 4th Meeting, Item 4),The Bill is down to be taken as first Order on Friday, 18th February,,2. The effect of the Bill is set out in L,C0(55) 22030 Little difficulty arises on clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, whichseek to reverse the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1930 and theTransport Act, 1953 in the direction of extending municipal trading.    Itis clear that these clauses should be opposed,4, The difficulty arises on clause 3, which seeks to permit a local authority to allow either free travel or reduced fares on itsmunicipal transport undertaking to old age pensioners8 persons underfifteen^ and other categories, and to charge the loss incurred against thegeneral rate fund.    Clause 4 prevents any part of the cost of this falling on the Exchequer,5, Until the recent decision in the case of prescotfc and the birmingham Corporation, out of some ninety authorities operatingmunicipal transport systems fourteen (including Birmingham) operateda system of free travel for old age pensioners, and fourteen allowed themto travel at reduced rates.    Two other local authorities allowed free orconcessionary travel for old age pensioners but in the time available Ihave not been able to find out the details.    All municipal (and, indeed, most-other) transport undertakings allowed reduced rates to children,6, The Solicitor-General informs me that the effect of the birmingham decision is to make it illegal for local authorities in theabsence of express statutory authority to grant free travel to any category of person, but to permit the grant, with the approval of the LicensingAuthorityP of reasonable concessionary fares, provided that recourse doesnot therefore have to be made by the transport undertaking to the generalrate fund,7, As a consequence, if no further action is taken, free travelwill have to be withdrawn in all cases where it at present operates, andconcessionary fares will only be possible where the cost can be carried by the transport undertaking itself.COPY NO, 7CABINETSECRETC(55) 4416th February3 1955


8. Four local au ihorities have submitted Private Bills toauthorise the continued grar c of free or concessionary travel, and oneScottish local authority is promoting a provisional order for the same purposeFour other local authorities are considering the promotion of similarprivate Bills but are waiting to see how this Private Member&apos;s Bill goesin the House before doing so.9. Representatives of a number of the major authorities concerned saw me last week and urged that the use of the general rate fund to support either free or concessionary travel should be legalised,,    one representative, with the apparent assent of his colleagues,, indicated thatin fairness to competing non-municipal transport undertakings it shouldbe obligatory in such cases to buy similar privileges for the same categories of persons on other transport undertakings such as private bus companiesor, indeed, the railways, which operate on the same or similar routes asthe municipal undertaking.The courses open to the Government are:&quot;To try to secure the defeat or talking out of tho Bill,This has the disadvantage of leaving us to face thelegal position resulting from the Birmingham case,and the consequent withdrawal of some advantagesnow enjoyed,,    Apparently even reduced fares for children would only be possible where the localauthorities1 transport undertakings could afford it;to allow clause 3 of the Bill to go through in itspresent form.    This would have a very serious effect on the competitive position of other transport -undertakings, since it would involve subsidisationout of the rates in favour of municipal transport undertakings which directly compete with privatebus undertakings and with the railways;to allow the Bill to obtain a Second Reading but toindicate an intention to insert in Committee aprovision on the lines of that mantioned in the second sentence of paragraph 9 above.    This would have the disadvantage of allowing old age pensioners and others to enjoy these advantages only in those towns and citieswhich run a transport undertaking.J.A.B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.15th February, 1955.(i)(ii)
