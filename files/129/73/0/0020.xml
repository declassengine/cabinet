&apos;82.secret.(55) 2022nd January, 1955AIR POLLUTIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will know that the Home Affairs Committeeon 20th January (H.A.(55) 2nd Meeting, Item 4) considered the Report ofthe Beaver Committee on Air Pollution (Cmds. 9011 and 9322)6    they invited the Ministers concerned to submit their proposals to the Cabinet.This memorandum, is about the financial and economic aspects of theseproposals.2. The cost to the national economy of the present situation isadequately set out in paragraphs 80=93 of the Report, which suggested a figure of some  250 millions a year.    We must also bear in mind the substantial savings in coal which could be the result of a clean air policy.It is against such a background that we must consider the Report.Availability of supplies of smokeless fuel3. The first point to which I would draw attention is this.    Theclean air policy proposed depends for its success upon there beingadequate supplies of smokeless fuel to burn.    If there are not, thecreation of smokeless zones may be held up.    If we are to announce thatwe accept the main conclusions of the Report, we must either be in aposition to say that we believe that adequate supplies of smokeless fuelswill be available to meet a satisfactory rate of creation of smokelesszones, both in the next five years and in the more distant future or we must avoid raising too high hopes of any rapid progress at all.Proposed financial concessions4. Turning to the financial concessions proposed I have had inmind the need to distinguish between those which are vital to the policy proposed, the rejection of which would make it impossible for us to acceptthe Report as a whole, and those which are not vital.The financial concessions proposed are:-(a) extension of the Government Loans Scheme(paragraph 29);(b) a subsidy for the replacement of unsuitabledomestic appliances by approved types(paragraph 85);COPY NO.CABINET
(c) the whole capital cost of industrial fuel savingand smoke-reducing equipment to be chargedagainst revenue for tax purposes in the year in which it is incurred (paragraph 3 0)5(d) removal of the 50 per cent purchase tax ongas and electric heaters (paragraph 72)eExtension of the Loans Scheme5 . I would be prepared to accept the case for this, if it isadministratively feasible, as an inducement to industry to take smoke-prevention seriously.    The National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service(who administer the scheme) have been consulted.    I understand that inthe main the proposal raises no difficulties, but that certain aspects ofit are unacceptable.Domestic appliances subsidy6, I regard this as being an integral part of the proposed policy,and suggest that, if we are to accept the Report at all. this must be accepted in principle.    It may cost as much as  2 - 3 millions a year for aconsiderable time, but although I cannot bind myself to accept the recommend-ation of the Report in detail, I do accept an Exchequer commitment.Further discussions will, therefore, be needed on the form of the subsidy,specifically on the following points - the definition of the appliances whichwill attract a Government grant, the proportion of the Local Authoritygrant to be reimbursed by the Exchequer, and the possibility of using the required legislation to prohibit the installation in the future of equipment which is not suitable for the burning of smokeless fuel, of ensuring that thesubsidised grates will in fact be used to burn smokeless fuels instead ofcoal, and of ensuring a reasonable level of prices for the subsidisedappliance s.Income Tax Allowance7. \ It may be argued (on much the same grounds as are given forthe grates subsidy) that this concession should be made because the invest-ment would be compulsory, but there are other forms of compulsory capitalexpenditure for which no special tax relief is given.    Substantial relief isalreadv given (e.g., 20 per cent investment allowance for plant and machineryplus normal depreciation allowances amounting to the full net cost) and wecan rightly claim that we are making a valuable concession in the extensionof the Government Loans Scheme.8. The objections to the Committeels proposal are very strong andI would regard them as overwhelming, the most important being:-(a) If this equipment were given special tax treatment^it would be extremely difficult to resist the extensionof such treatment to other types of asset which mayhave some particular importance to the national economy.(b) It would be quite impracticable to draw up a viablelist of all such assets.    Yet in the absence of sucha list the giving of special tax relief in respect ofparticular types of asset would amount to arbitrary
discrimination and would undermine the sense ofjustice and fair play as between one taxpayer andanother on which the efficiency of the tax machinelargely depends.(c)     It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,to define precisely the many and varied types of equipment which could lead to fuel saving orsmoke prevention.Removal of the 50 per cent purchase tax on gas and electric heaters9. This would cost S.4j millions a year.    I do not think that theinducement which such a concession would provide for a wider use of gasand electricity would justify such a cost to the revenue, one moreoverwhich would be quite disproportionate to the cost of the other recommend-ations.    For space -heating, gas and electricity are at present more appropriate for casual or occasional usej  removing the tax would reducethe initial cost by about a quarter, but it would need a much biggerincentive than that to lead to these appliances taking the place of coal firesfor regular use in the winter.    They are expensive to run and are commonlyregarded as a poor substitute for the ordinary fire.    For water-heating, thealternative to gas or electricity is usually smokeless fuel (e. g. coke) inthe domestic boiler, so that nothing is to be gained so far as smoke abate -ment is concerned by encouraging the use of gas and electric water heaters.It is true that any move towards gas and electricity for water-heating mighttend to release supplies of coke, and would thus be welcome j   but here again the inducement would be marginal compared with the disincentive of thegreater running cost of heating water with gas or electricity, and I do notbelieve that it would have any appreciable effect.    There would moreoverbe considerable difficulties in picking out these particular appliances for aspecial purchase tax concession.Conclusions10, I conclude  -(i) that it is most important that we should be clear aboutsupplies of smokeless fuel before we accept the Report;(ii) that some financial concessions will be necessary, and thatthe most important (and least difficult for me to accept)are the extension of the Loans Scheme and the   .domestic appliances subsidy, and we should accept these in principle, subject to the reservations I setout in paragraphs 5 and 6 above iI invite my colleagues to endorse these conclusions,11, I propose to reject the two tax concessions, as being of little value in the implementation of a clean air policy and as being highly understandable precedents in the taxation field,R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.21st January, 1955,
