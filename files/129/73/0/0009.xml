PRICE OF SUGARMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 21st December (CaC.(54) 90th Conclusions, Minute 7) theCabinet:&quot;(i) Agreed in principle that the price at which theGovernment sold sugar to refiners in thiscountry should be increased by an amount which was likely to lead to an increase of a jdaa lb. in the retail price of sugar.(ii)  Invited me to consider the timing of this price increase, in consultation with the other ministers most directly concerned, and to submit our views for the Prime Minister !s approval.2.        The view had been expressed in Cabinet that, if a price increase was inevitable, there were political arguments in favour of allowing it tocome into operation earlier rather than later.    It was also suggested thatthe price increase might be delayed until the new rates of national assistance were in operation, i. e. in the first week of February.    Fromthe, point of view of the Exchequer, the sooner the price of sugar is increased the better, and the Minister of Food has agreed that the price to the refiners should be raised at the end of this month.    This wouldmean that the increase in retail prices will take place during the first week or ten days of February.    The Minister of Labour, the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance concur inthis proposal,3.        The Prime Minister has asked that the proposal should bereferred to the Cabinet, and I accordingly ask my colleagues to agreethat the price of raw sugar to the refiners should be increased at theend of this month.R.A.B.COPY NO.63CABINETTreasury Chambers, S.W.I.17th January, 1955.SECRETCn(55) 918th January, 1955
