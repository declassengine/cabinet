I;/. -/*?/75 -aj^s(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAXESTYfS G O VE RN ME NT)SECRETCc(55) 40 COPY NO,12th February9 1955CABINETREVIEW OF THE GENERAL. agreement on TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.AoT.T0)negotiations are reaching their concluding stages at Geneva,    Animportant consideration at this stage is to preserve the highest possibledegree of Commonwealth agreement,    It looks as though the G.A.T0T0is likely to emerge from these negotiations in a form not markedlydifferent from the existing Agreement,,     The G0A0T0T0 rules will certainly not be tightened to the extent which the Government originallywished us to achieves    On the other hand the fact that the rules will notbe much tighter will not necessarily make the Agreement any harder todefend^20 The problems, as well as the advantages, of the rulesaffecting tariffs,, quotas and exports which arise for us under the existingGoA0T0T0 and which I have placed before the Cabinet on a number of occasions, v/ill remain substantially unchanged under any new agreement which is likely to be reached,,3, There are four points on which I consider we should try to achieve a satisfactory conclusion in these final stages of the negotiations,(i) A pi^provision described below which will give ussome flexibility in relation to the Colonies,(ii) Equal rights with other European countries tocontinue existing quota restrictions to protectparticularly difficult items for a period afterbalance of payments difficulties have ended!and the right to maintain existing discrimination in these quotas0(iii) Agreement by the United States that the general arrangements relating to their waiver permittingagricultural quotas shall be subject to review in I960, or earlier,,(iv)  Inclusion in the record of the GoA^ToT.., review ofany statement necessary to enable Ministers tosay that in the last resort general discrimination against a scarce currency could be authorised underthe waiver procedure, to prevent a generaldownward tendency of trade
4, I consider it. essential in presenting the revised agreement to Parliament that we should announce the Governments intention to seeklegislative powers to U3e countervailing duties and anti-dumping dutiesso as to protect our industry and agriculture against unfair competition from abroad.    This was agreed in principle by the Economic PolicyCommittee on 4th February /jEoA0 (55) 4th Meeting, Minute 3 J and I.hope that the Cabinet will now endorse this decision.    There are somequite complex problems involved in this and I shall be submitting to theEconomic Policy Committee in due course a memorandum dealing withthe consultations I have had with industry, the scope of the legislation,and the timing of any announcement.TheCclonial Position5C The Chancellor of the Exchequer said at Blackpool&quot;We propose to fight for adjustments to meet the special needs of theColonies&quot;0     I said at Geneva that certain Colonial problems arose wherea developing industry depended not on selling in the limited domestic market of the territory, but on exporting the product to the metropolitancountry., and that &quot;we would wish to seek arrangements within the frame-work of the G.A0T.T0 to deal with these needs individually as they arise&quot;06. All of us would like a provision which goes even further than these statements,, ,   We would like to be completely rid of the no-new-preference rule in so far as the Colonies are concerned.    Unfortunatelysuch an amendment to the GoA0ToT0 would cut directly across Article Iof the Agreement and would require unanimity if it v/as to be carried.We have discussed such an amendment with other countries including members of the Commonwealth and my advice is that there is no chanceof carrying it.    To put it to the vote knowing that we would fail would inmy judgment substantially inci&quot; gels e the political difficulties of defendingthe GeAeToTo before Parliament.7, Instead I propose that we should seek a waiver in the termssummarised in the Annex to this paper    This should help use    We shouldhave secured freedom, subject to certain procedures, to take action toassist Colonial exports to our own market by quotas or countervailingduties against imports from other suppliers.    International acceptanceof the waiver in the GoA0ToTo would have presentational advantages athome and in the Colonies0    Its existence would also strengthen our handsfor rejecting protests from other countries whose trade was injured byexport subsidies on Colonial products exported to our market,,    Even inrelation to preferences it would have some presentational value, for itwould to some extent prepare the way for getting individual waivers topermit preferences on particular products,,    I propose also that in the drafting of any waiver permitting us to retain protective quotas (seeparagraph 9 below) we should make it clear that we require freedom toretain such quotas in the interest of the Colonies,8, In addition, the Colonial Secretary and I are examining withthe Chancellor what immediate action could be taken on some of the morepressing Colonial problems such as bananas, citrus fruits and cigars.Protective Quotas and the American Waiver9. The Americans will probably get a waiver unlimited in time which will enable them to impose protective quotas on those agricultural products which they price support subject to strict rules about consultation.We and Europe look like getting a waiver which will allow us to retain our
quotas on the more sensitive items, agricultural or otherwise3 up tillI960,    A waiver on the American pattern would be of no value to usbecause it would be limited to products which are price supported in a manner which, attracts abnormal imports (it would not cove?, e0 g0 apples).It would also certainly have to be non-discriminatory, i0e0i. we shouldhave to impose quotas against the Commonwealth - to whom, in any case,a waiver for other countries on the American pattern would be mostrepugnanto    In these circumstances, I recommend that we should demandequal rights with Europe and seek with. Commonwealth support to ensurethat the general arrangements for the American waiver are subject to review in I960 or ear lies.10, I personally believe that it would be in our interest to havethe right to maintainexisting discrimination in these protective quotaarrangements3 and that this should be our objectives    I should warn mycolleagues, however, that not only will this be opposed by Canada3 whowill be hit by the United States, European and United Kingdom waivers,but it may also be opposed by some sterling Commonwealth countries whofear discrimination against them by Germany,,    In addition, the attitudeof the European countries is uncertain.Discrimination Against a Scarce Currency11, We must be able to satisfy Parliament that if the dollarbecomes generally scarce the G.A0T0T0 would not prevent the ContractingParties from organising discrimination against the dollar.    There isprovision in the International Monetary Fund Agreement for authorisation of discrimination after a finding of general scarcity but the public are well aware of the importance of the United States weighted vote and thepossibility of its use to block such author is ation0    In such circumstances we might still be able to rally sufficient support among ContractingParties to sec-are waivers under the G,A.cabinet. so as to allow of dis-crimination and we must ensure that the record includes some statement which will enable Ministers to say (with assurance) that in the last resortgeneral discrimination against a scarce currency could if necessary beauthorised under the waiver procedure to prevent a general downwardstrend in trade    On this, the Chancellor and I have concerted withMr, Menziesin order to preserve a common front at Geneva,,\Conclusion1Z0 I consider that we have a good chance of getting in substanceour requirements on the points mentioned in paragraph 3 above.    our negotiators are well aware of the political difficulties involved in presenting the GoA,TaTo to Parliament,    It is already quite clear that governments will need to consider the Agreement as a whole before deciding whether they can recommend it to their Parliaments and our delegation should be told to make it plain that the outcome of thenegotiations on these four points will be of decisive significance forHer Majesty!s Government in this respect.    The chances of securingacceptance of our requirements will be greatly improved if our Delegationcan say that we should be prepared to recommend the revised agreement to Parliament, if our requirements on these four points are met,I recommend that we should now give this authority to our Delegation,On the other hand there is no need at this stage to make any of the pointsbreaking points; as the negotiations proceed through this crucial stagewe shall have to take further decisions on these questions and to decide
whether to authorise our Delegation to accept the texts of the protocol of amendments and of the agreement cn organisation.Board of Trade, S0W.l011th February, 19550ANNEXSUMMARY OF PROPOSED COLONIAL WAIVERSubject to the conditions set out below, the waiver would permit the United Kingdom to accord to exporting Colonial industriesfacilities not otherwise compatible with the G0A0T.T0 provided that theseare similar to facilities which may be accorded, consistently with theAgreement, to domestic industries of the United Kingdom itselfDThe conditions ars:-(a) Frior notification before action is taken;(b) consultation with the Contracting Partiesif requested within thirty days;(c) if consultation is requesteds no action for ninety days from the date of the notification unless the consultation results in earlier concurrence;(d) no increase of a preference without specificapproval under the standard waiver procedure of Article XXV;(e) action only to be taken if designed solely to benefit the Colonies;(f) all action taken to be reviewed annually bythe Contracting Parties.
