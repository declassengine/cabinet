Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.      9C. (55) 5016th February, 1955CABINETTELEVISION DEVELOPMENT: SUNDAY broadcasting memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe companies providing programmes for the Independent television authority (I.T.A.) at its first three stations (in London, the Midlands and SouthLancashire) are being granted contracts to operate, some from Monday to Friday,others on Saturday and Sunday. An important problem under discussion withthe &quot; week-end &quot; companies is the period during which they should be allowedto broadcast on Sunday.2. The present proposal is that they should be on the air from 2 p.m. to11 p.m., with a break between 6 and 7 p.m. a total of eight hours broadcasting(apart from any religious services they may broadcast). The question has arisen,however, whether Sunday television should be permitted between 3 and 4 p.m.,the normal Sunday School period. It is strongly urged by the companies thatSunday afternoon is one of the most attractive periods for viewing in the ordinaryhousehold and they feel it would be quite wrong to deprive the adult populationof this benefit from 3 to 4 p.m. merely because a limited number of parents maybe unable to persuade their children to go to Sunday School. Moreover, thecompanies have undertaken to provide programmes from 3 to 4 p.m. which willnot be attractive to the normal child, e.g., half an hour &quot; In the News &quot; (a politicaldiscussion on the lines of that given on Friday evenings by the B.B.C.) and half an hour orchestral music.3. The B.B.C. also would much prefer their Sunday television period to startat 3 p.m., instead of 4 p.m. as at present.4. I have not consulted the Sunday School organisations or the B.B.C.Churches Advisory Committee, because it seems clear that their views must be against any counter-attraction to Sunday School; once they have committed themselves against, our position would become more difficult. Nevertheless,viewing the problem as a whole, I think it right to authorise television service from 2 to 6 p.m. without a compulsory &quot;Sunday School&quot; break, but with thecondition that, between 3 and 4 p.m., there must be &quot; adult&quot; programmes unlikely to attract children. As however this decision may give rise to some controversy,I think my colleagues should know of it before I notify the I.T.A.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,16th February, 1955,47680
