LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMivJBMemorandum by the minister of Agriculture and fisheries and minister of food in C. (55) 45 the Lord Privy Seal invites the Cabinet to. decide whether to proceed with the Sugar Bill this Session, or to drop the bill until next year.    There are the following drawbacks to dropping tha Bill.,2,        The Bill is designed to end state trading in sugar and to freethe import of sugar and sugar-containing goods while enabling us tocarry out our obligations to producers overseas under the commonwealth sugar Agreement and to producers at home under the agriculture act, 1947.    That we should, as far as possible, conclude the process ofhanding back the food trades to private hands during the lifetime of thepresent Parliament is an important consideration.3.        If the Bill is postponed the new Department of Food and agriculture would have to remain the sole buyer of sugar for home consumption, quota restrictions on imports of sugar-containing goods-(which have-already caused us some trouble in the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and the present complex administrative arrange-ments applying to the export of sugar-containing goods would have toremain, and it would be uncertain whether the London Sugar market would think it worth while to re-open,4.        Producers, refiners, the sugar-using trades and the LondonSugar Market have been encouraged to believe that the new Sugar board will be functioning and the import trade in sugar and sugar-containinggoods entirely freed by the end of this year at latest.    They havealready suffered much frustration and the prospect of the postponementfor a further twelve months of legislation which has their goodwill and support will be a great disappointment to them.5.        I do not, of course, question the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s view that theBill is controversial nor that it is complex.    But much of its length andof its complexity lies in the need to provide powers for the Customs and excise Department v/hich follow tha normal and well-trodden lines of customs legislation,6.        The Opposition^ criticism is likely to be focused on -the surcharge,because the Bill imposes the excesscost of Commonwealth-Agreement and home-producedsugar on the consumer (who bears it at present)Instead of the taxpayer;COPY MO. secret.(55) 4616th February,1955- - CABINET
(ii)   the continuation of the British Sugar Corporation as alimited company with private shareholders;  and(iii)   the monopolistic position of Tate and Lyle.Some of our people may not like the Sugar Board at first sight, but I-think they will prefer it to a continuation of Ministry of Food trading,,Some may not like the market sharing arrangements, though these have been in operation for tv/enty years,70        i agree that the Bill is a tiresome and complicated one and islikely to take up a lot of time in Committee,    The postponement ofthe 3ill would be inconvenient but not disastrous.    On the other hand,as it was referred to in The Gueen&apos;s Speech I should have thoughtthat, on balance, the arguments were in favour of proceeding,,D.H.A.ivlinistry of Food, S.
