C(69) 50 COPY NO.       6613th May, 1969CABINETUPRATING OF SOCIAL, SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesBenefitsIn his Budget Statement the Chancellor announced that thestandard rate of retirement pension for a single person will beincreased by 10s. from  4.10, 0, a week to  5 and the rate for a married couple will go up by 16s. from  7. 6. 0. to  8. 2. 0.    These increases will restore the value lost because of the rise in prices in the two years since the last uprating.    In the same way the benefit for 100 per centdisablement in both the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes will be increased by 16s. to  8. 8, 0. , industrial death benefit for widows will be increased by 10s. to  5.11. 0. and the standard rate ofwar widowts pension will go from  5.17. 0. to  6.10. 0.    The level atwhich the earnings rule for retirement pension begins to operate willalso be raised from  6.10. 0. to  7.10. 0.    I am also proposing toextend cover for Death Grant, on a close relative*s insurance, to peopleso handicapped from childhood that they cannot enter employment and establish an insurance record for themselves.2.      The principal increase in war pensions and supplementary benefits :Will he announced when, the Bill is published, though they willbe affoctedr through other instruments.    The increases for supplementary benefit will be (a) 5s, in the scale rate for the single householder,from  4,11. 0, to  4.16. 0. and (b) 8s. in the rate for the married couple, from  7. 9. 0. to  7,17. 0.    The reason for this differencebetween the increases in supplementary benefits and those in retirement pensions is that people on supplementary benefits have already received,in October, 1968, the first instalment of the increases needed to offsetprice rises since October, 1967.    To provide a 10s. increase for peopleon supplementary benefit next November would be to give them a realincrease in benefit going beyond the increase in the cost of living.-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PR.GPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)

Costs3.      The cost of my proposals (including war pensions but allowing for savings on supplementary benefit) is  238 million in the first full year.The cost to the National Insurance Funds of the higher benefits in thefirst full year will be  243 million.    However, the extra income whichthe Funds will need will be a good deal more than fefeeeej the national insurance Fund is already in heavy deficit because of the unexpectedlyhigh numbers drawing sickness benefit and retirement pensions and because of the relatively high level of unemployment;  these deficits will increase because the number of pensioners is growing faster than theworking population.    The deficit last year was about  80 million, andthere will be a further heavy deficit this year before the irprating can take effect.    The deficits in 1970-71 and 1971-72, apart from the upratihg andafter allowing for the rising yield from graduated contributions ifearnings go up by 3 per cent a year, would be about  160 million and 220 million respectively.    Because of the recent adverse experienceof the Fund we must allow for a reasonable margin of safety in itsfinances.    Further details of all this are given in the Annex,    For these reasons, the amount of extra income we need to raif e for the national insurance Funds is about  440 million in the first full year.Contributions4,      To raise this amount wholly by raising flat-rate contributions,with normal Exchequer supplement, would mean an increase of about3s. 6d each for employer and employee on the man^s contribution.    I donot think this is tolerable.    In winding up the Budget debate, theChancellor has already ruled out any question of making employers pay more than their normal share and it would not be right to make the schemeunduly dependent on Exchequer finance.5.      &quot;We are now in a period, of transition to the new earnings-relatedscheme,    I therefore propose to share the contribution burden morefairly and to take a step towards the contribution structure of the new scheme by raising about half the money needed by increasing the graduated contributions on earnings between  18 and  30 a week from\ per cent to Z\ per cent.    This will enable us, if we put in a proportionateamount of Exchequer money, to keep the flat-rate increase down toIs, 6d a side.    The increase for an employed man will then raiage fromIs. 6d., on earnings of up to  18 a week, to 6s,Ud. on earnings of  30or more.    The contribution for employed women will go up by Id a sideless and for the self-employed by 2s.  8d (men) and 2s, 4d (women).2-

I have recognised, of course, that I must find some way of improving the present graduated scheme which will enable us to commendits extension.    I propose that we should publicly promise to includegraduated pensions earned under the present scheme in the two-yearlyrevaluation of pensions which is to be a feature of our new pension scheme.8.      The present graudated pensions are built up on the &quot;brick&quot; system.Each  7, 10. 0. which a man pays in graduated contributions (matched by the same payment from his employer) secures 6d a week pension.This pension &quot;brick&quot; remains fixed in cash terms.    Ever since theConservative Government designed the graduated scheme, which theyintroduced in 1961, we have been sharply critical of its lack of any provision for revaluing the pension &quot;brick&quot; to keep pace with changesin price or earnings levels over life.    This deficiency I now propose to remedy.-3-

9.       There is threefold justification.    First, a promise to dynamise(i. e. to revalue) the present graduated pensions, from 1972 onwards,corrects the worst defect of the Conservative Governments scheme.Second, we shall be helping people who are already too old to get muchextra, or Indeed anything extra, from our new pension scheme j and thiswill serve, in a small way, to ease the contrast between old scheme andnew scheme pensioners, which is a cause of great concern to theTrades Union Congress (TUC) - as indeed it is to me.    Third, it willredress the balance between contracted out and other employees,10.       I have had strong representations from the National Associationof Pension Funds about the need for such redress.    They have rightlypointed out that in general the contracting out terms have givensubstantial advantage to contracted out firms and their emphoye-r-s,particularly in recent yearb.    This is because the terms have remained unchanged since 1963, despite the rise in interest rates, whichhaa enabled occupational pension provision to be made more cheaply.Further, employees&apos;1 occupational scheme contributions can attract tax relief;  and these contributions, in the case of contracted out employees,are partly in replacement of State scheme contributions on whichemployees get no tax relief.Consultations11,       From my consultations with the representative bodies   chiefly concerned, I find that the line-up of attitudes to my proposals is asfollows.    Although neither are formally committed, both the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the TUC have indicated that, In principle,they would support a proposal to dynamise these graduated pensions from1972 onwards.    Their membership will, however, be divided on thequestion whether contracted out employees should get the same amounts of extra pension by being awarded the pension increases they would havehad if they had participated fully in the State scheme.    It is clear that employers could not be required to provide such increases.    Nor couldthey be provided at the expense of the State scheme, if only because wecould not assess what each employee should get.    In any event such a move would make the whole operation self-defeating since one of itsobjects is to redress the balance which has swung too far in favour ofthe contracted out.    The National Association of Pension Funds, whichis more fully committed to supporting the line I propose, also hasmembers - though a minority - who will urge that contracted outemployees cannot be left outside any pension revaluation.    But what all this amounts to is that some people v/ill press us to go even further than we are prepared to go; not that we shall be criticised for going so far.12,      The most serious opposition comes from the Life OfficesAssociation.    They have warned me that they v/ould regard an undertaking to dynamiae the graduated pensions as tantamount to retrospectiverevision of the terms cf a contract entered into by the Government,-4-

unless (which, as I have ex-sef*5pied, is impracticable) contracted outemployees v/ere to be given the same extra pension as if they had notbeen contracted out.    I am told that the British Insurance Association,which represents the whole of the insurance world, fully shares the LifeOffices! view.    A rather similar line may be taken by most of the nationalised industries.13t       There are some powerful points we can make in countering thesecomplaints.    In the first place, It Is, and will&apos;remain, open to employers to cease contracting out if they want to, and to buy peoplestill in their employment back into the State scheme on well-establishedterms, which we do not propose to alter.    Although there are complicatingfactors which makes this less than a complete answer, there Is here a road open to those employers who wish to take it - indeed one of the LifeOffices&apos; feare Is that many will decide to do so. . Second - even-although some schemes may well be brought back into the State scheme - it isonly a small proportion of contracted out employees who will in practice be left with occupational pensions which are actually of a lower amountthan the additional pension they could otherwise have received from theState scheme.    Among the S\ million employees currently contracted outby far the largest single group at risk are in the Mineworkers&apos; Scheme,with a membership of about 400, 000; but I understand that this schemeis, in any event, overdue for MSiproveraent.    There may also be something like, say, 300,000 or 400,000 of those currently contracted out in the private sector who would be left with occupaticnal pensionslower than the graduated pensions they would otherwise have receivedfrom the State scheme and for whom nothing at all could be done.    the overall picture is, then, that only a relatively small minority of thosecontracted out would be left with occupational pensions significantlysmaller than the extra State pension they might otherwise have received.14,      There is also a much more general point.    What, in effect, weshall be deciding are the terms on which the present graduated scheme should be wound up before it has run anything like its full term.    Theshortness of its life means that the extent to which participants can have earned bigger pensions than contracted out employees will be strictly limited, and that in consequence to give future increases on thosepensions which contracted out employees do not share need produce nomarked disparity.    To promise that the present graduated pensions willbe dynamised, as I propose, is entirely consistent with the arrangements which will obtain under the new scheme.    Indeed - as the C3I have pointed out - It would look increasingly odd in future years if just thatsmall part of the State pension, representing the graduated pensionearned under the present scheme, were left frozen in cash terms.15. -    The coot of dynamising the graduated pensions irom 1972 can be accomodated within the White Paper estimates of expenditure since these were based on constant (April, 1968) earnings.    In cash terms,revaluation would cost something like  2 million or  3 million a year

at the first uplift; and assuming, by way of illustration, 5 per cent a yearpost-award dynamism, the annual cost could have grown to about 43 million by 1982-83.    Even by the end of the century, however, thecost would represent no more than about Zj per cent of total pensionexpenditure - or in terms of contributions about 1/7 per cent a side ofreckonable earnings.    More immediately, the step I propose will be offinancial advantage to us because it should deter from contracting out certain leading employers (such as Unilever and Shell) who havethreatened to do so if we fail to redress the balance between contracted out and other employees by dynamising the graduated pensions,16.      Everything points therefore to giving the undertaking I propose;and with this in the package, the increases in gradviated contributions will be made a good deal more palatable,,-Conclusion17.      I invite my colleagues to;-(l)    approve the various benefit increases (paragraphs 1-2);(2)    approve the contribution increases I have suggested(paragraphs 4-6);(3)    authorise the publication of the Bill on 21st May and that astatement should be made at the same time about the intentionto dynamise the graduated pension as from the commencemsntof the new scheme.R.0U.S,C.Department of Health and Social Security, S.E.1.13th May, 1969

annex note on deficits in the National Insurance Fmxds1.   It was always known that the number of pensioners would be growing faster than the working population until after 1980.   For this reason, theConservative Act of 1959 provided for contributions to be increased withoutany increase in benefits, at five-yearly intervals between 1965 and 1980.Such an increase, yielding about  90 million, is due next April.   As was done in 1965, I propose to cancel this increase and absorb it into the uprating.2.   Over the last few years the number of pensioners has been growing faster than expected because thejr have been retiring sooner and living longer.   Forsome years there has also been a marked increase in the level of sickness.Finally, unemployment is at a historically high level and the number of people at work has been shrinking.3.   For these reasons the National Insurance Fund had an unexpected deficit of  92 million in 1967/68 and a deficit of about  80 million last year.This was dn spite of our having put up the contributions last May, withoutany increase in benefits, under the Public Expenditure and Receipts Act.Further, in December we had to get the authority of the Commons to draw 200 million from the National Insurance (Reserve) Fund merely in order tokeep the National Insurance Fund in balance.   Even with this reinforcementthe Fund will again be approaching an uncomfortably low level by next winter.   Even after the contribution increases I am proposing, there islikely to be a deficit of some  90 million this year.4.   The effect of the proposals in the paper will be to produce a surplusof about  AO million in 1970/71 and &amp; deficit of about  25 million in1971/72.   If earnings rise faster than 3 per cent the position will be rather better and provide some additional safeguard against further adverseexperience.
