DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)9169134.COPY NO.CABINETPARLIAMENTI circulate a revised version c  the draft statement which accompanied my earlier memorandum (C(69) 25).    I propose torefer to this at tomorrow morning&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet.H.W.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1.24th March, 1969

DRAFT statement the House will recall that on 4th March I was asked by myHonourable Friend the Member for West Fife &quot;whether in view of the increasing number of hon. Members being remunerated by outside bodies, he will re-examine the desirability of legislation to establish a public register of such interests. &quot;   I said that the Governmentwere continuing to watch the position and in answers to Questions bythe Right Honourable and learned gentleman the Member for EastHertfordshire referred to the disparity between the treatment, so faras this House is concerned, of honourable members who are requiredby long established practice to declare their interest, and other whoare not so required.I should now like to tell the House the results of the Governmentsexamination of the issues raised.As I have more than once suggested there are two separateissues here.The first is the position of Members of Parliament who by virtue of some paid connection with an outside interest, be it domesticor overseas, are involved in matters which are the concern ofParliament and of Government.    As I indicated in reply to myhonourable Friend, it is important that the position of such members should be made clear in all matters which affect their responsibilities to the House and to their Parliamentary colleagues.This is an issue for Parliament.   After consultations with theOpposition parties, the Government have therefore decided torecommend to the House to set up a Sub-Committee of the Committee of privileges to consider the rules and practices of the House in relationto the declaration of Members1 interests and to report.    This relatesonly to the House of Commons, but my Noble Friend the Lord privy seal will be having discussions on parallel action that might be takenin another place.-1-

There is however a second issue about which there isconsiderable public concern, and concern in this House.    This relates to the operation of public relations and other organisations holding an account or a commission on behalf of an overseas Government, or anoverseas political interest.    The activities of some of these organisa-tions have been mentioned in this House on a number of occasions, andthere is concern about their activities, whether or not they employ onany basis individual Members of this House.    &quot;What is important is that parliament, and the public, should know when activities of this kind arebeing conducted.    Many of these organisations do valuable work in informing Parliament and the public:  the danger&quot; occurs when it is not done in an open way.    There is increasing evidence that some of these organisations are at least as concerned with operating on the media ofcommunication outside Parliament as on Parliament and on theGovernment.    Again the pub-Mo liaa a jrigiit) to know.Equally, it is right that the House should be aware of theproblems associated with the administration of any scheme designed tobring these activities into the open.    The House will be concerned toensure that whatever is finally decided reflects a fair balance betweenprotection of Parliament and the public on the one hand and free andlegitimate expression of opinion on the other.The Government have given urgent consideration to thisquestion, including the possibility of legislation requiring registration.I now propose to initiate discussions with the Opposition parties to see how far agreement can be reached on the best way of proceeding.-2-
