C(69) 47 COPY NO.____666th May, 1969CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by  he Lord Chance11 or at their meeting on 5th May the Home Affaire committee considered a memorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Secretary of State for Wales setting out thearguments for and against amending the provisions of the leasehold reform Act, 1967 which govern the price to be paid by an enfranchisingtenant.    The Lands Tribunal held in the first two cases decided under theAct that the tenant must be regarded as a bidder in the market for thepurpose of determining the price.    Report Stage of the Housing Bill isdue to be taken on Monday, 19th May and this would provide an opportunityto make any change mat may be decided on, though it may be difficult toget satisfactory amendments drafted in time.2,       The significance of the presence of the leaseholder in the marketis that only he is in a position to unite the freehold and leaseholdinterests and to realise the &quot;marriage value&quot;, with the consequence thathe is likely to be prepared to pay a higher price than any other bidder.It is clear that both the Ministerial Committee on Legislation on Rent,Land Commission and Leasehold Enfranchisement and the Cabinetintended that the leaseholder should pay for this &quot;marriage value&quot;.    Theproposals formulated by the Committee and endorsed by the Cabinet gave the right of enfranchisement to all leaseholders holding under a lease,granted for more than 21 years at a ground rent, of a house below RentAct limits of rateable value who had been in occupation for more than five years;  the price was to be the market value of the freeholder&apos;interest as depreciated by the 50 year extension of the lease granted toleaseholders.    Paragraph 3 of C(66) 29, submitting the proposals to theCabinet states -&quot;These proposals seem to the Committee to have the followingad vantage s:-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT)

(i)  The principle underlying the policy of leasehold enfranchisement is that in equity the bricks and mortar belong to the qualified leaseholder and the land to the freeholder.    The50 year extension of lease effectively separates these interests the market value of the freeholder^ interest in a lease with50 years or more to run cannot include anything for thereversionary value of the bricks and mortar.    At the same time,if he is given the right to a fully modernised ground rent afterthe expiry of the present lease^ he is not being deprived of anyof the reversionary value of the land.    Market value depreciatedby such an extension of lease is therefore bound to yield a fairprice for enfranchisement, giving the freeholder neither morenor less than the value of his interest in the land for existing use.This, plus ,blanketedt development value, if any, can beconfidently defended as fair treatment for the freeholder once the principle on which we are working is accepted as equitable.(ii) The price will in the great majority of cases be less thanthe market value which the freeholder^ interest has under theexisting law................11In the Annex, which gives examples of how prices payable under theproposed scheme would compare with prices recently paid by leaseholders,the prices under the scheme are expressly stated to include the marriagevalue.3.       There is therefore no question of either the Act or the LandsTribunals interpretation of the Act failing to give effect to theGovernments intentions.    The case for change rests on quite differentgrounds.    The point about marriage value does not seem to have beenmade clear in Parliament and there is evidence that since the decisionsthere has been some hardening of the prices at which landlords are preparedto sell.    There has been criticism in the Press and considerable pressure from backbenchers for amendment of the Act.4.       The Minister of Housing, while recognising the pressures,concludes that on balance it would be better to leave things as they are.It is impossible to infer from the decided cases how legislation &quot;to exclude the tenant from the market&quot; would affect prices; the decidedcases were both in London, where land values are high, and the effectmight be very much smaller in areas of low values, such as the miningvalleys.    If the law were changed leaseholders might still be dissatisfied,and there would be pressure for retrospective legislation from those whohad enfranchised under the old terms.5.       In the view of the Secretary of State for Wales leasehold enfranchisement will be frustrated if leaseholders are required to pay forthe marriage value and there will be a heavy political price to pay.Uncertainty as to how the marriage value was to be divided would enable-2-

landlords to hold out for higher prices and exploit the unwillingness ofleaseholders to resort to the costly process of appeal to the lands tribunal,, for which, in spite of the strong recommendation of the legal aid Advisory Committee, legal aid is still not available.    The original decision of the Cabinet that leaseholders should pay for the marriagevalue was in his opinion inconsitent with the basic principle that in equitythe bricks and mortar belonged to the leaseholder.6.      In discussion the majority of the Committee agreed with the viewof the Secretary of State for Wales that the law must be amended if thepolitical advantage gained by leasehold enfranchisement is not to be lost.If a change is to be made it would seem unnecessary to legislate both toprovide that the leaseholder shall not be regarded as in the market andto exclude the marriage value, since these are facets of the same thing.Either way the result is likely to be to make it difficult to attribute value to small properties which would not attract a purchase for investment.7.      I invite the Cabinet to decide whether the Leasehold Reform Act,1967 should be amended to provide that in fixing the price to be paid onenfranchisement the leaseholder shall be assumed rot to be in the market.G.House of Lords, S.W.1.5th May, 1969-3-
