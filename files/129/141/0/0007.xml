ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees 1969I.  introduction. On 12tli November 1968 the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodannounced the Governments broad objectives for agriculture to 1972/73. after a thorough look at the industry&apos;s contribution to the economy over past years,they had decided that the policy of selective expansion of agriculture should berolled forward to 1972/73, subject to the continued improvement in pro-productivity. The development of the programme, its cost in public expenditure and resources required and the market situation would be examined with theindustry at each Annual Review during that period.2. This has been the background to the 1969 Annual Review.Priority commodities3. Within the revised programme of selective expansion, priority goes towheat and barley, beef and pigmeat.4. First, cereals. Cereals production has recently tended to increase moreslowly. Last year the acreage under cereals showed no increase. Then camethe exceptionally difficult harvest and seriously reduced yields. As a result, and despite the substantial increases in guaranteed prices for cereals at last year&apos;sReview, net income from cereals fell. This was a blow to cereals producers.Now further substantial increases in the guaranteed prices of wheat and barleyare to be made to raise profitability, to provide additional resources for invest-ment, and so to get things moving again. Wheat goes up to 29s. Od. a cwt. anincrease of Is. 7d. and barley to 26s. Od. a cwt. an increase of lOd. Inaddition the Government have decided to abolish the standard quantity forbarley.5. Secondly, beef. Here the situation is much more encouraging. After a remarkable recovery from the disaster of foot-and-mouth, both the dairy and thebeef herds have been going ahead. Beef, together with cereals, is the key to theexpansion programme, and beef output in the later years of the programme willbe largely determined by decisions taken on the farm this year and next.This is why the Government are giving a new stimulus now. The guaranteed price for fat cattle is being put up by 15s. Od. a cwt. so as to increase profitabilityand encourage investment.   More specifically, extra production from the pure
beef herd needs to be encouraged. So the rates of hill cow and beef cowsubsidy are being put up by  1 each and the stocking ratios for these subsidiesarc being improved where they apply.6. Thirdly, pigs. Pig numbers are increasing satisfactorily. To ensure thata steady expansion is maintained, the guaranteed price will be increased by 6d. ascore and there will be a substantial increase in the number of pigs that can come forward without causing a drop in the effective guaranteed price. Thiswill be done by raising the &quot;middle band&quot; of the flexible guarantee arrangementsby 400,000 pigs.An integrated programme. The priority commodities have been looked at individually. But they arerelated to each other.8. We shall get more cereals from better technology and resumption of the upward trend in yields. We must also get more acres under the plough. this in turn will call for heavier stocking and better management of an increasing number of livestock on a smaller grassland acreage. Many farmers will need to change their husbandry patterns and practices. The sooner this starts, the sooner will the benefit be felt by farmers themselves and by the economy as awhole.The determinations9. Details of the Governments determinations on the priority commodities the others are given in Part III. Together they add  34 million to the valueof the guarantees. This is after allowing for the maximum cut on eggs inaccordance with the policy already announced.Some general considerations10. Largely because of the bad harvest but partly also because of the aftermathof foot-and-mouth, both net output and net income arc expected to be lower in1968/69 than in 1967/68. Even though fluctuations in income caused by un-predictable factors like weather and disease are inevitable and are part of thenormally accepted risk of the business, it was a difficult year for many farmers.But the fact remains that the underlying trend in output and efficiency is stillfirmly upward. Given normal weather, net income instead of falling shouldhave risen. With anything like average conditions in 1969, not only shouldlast year&apos;s setback be restored but income should improve further. Neverthe-less, the Government have recognised on this occasion that the setback is bound to make it more difficult for the industry to invest in expanding productionand improving productivity.11. The Government have increased the guarantees on wheat and barley, beef and pigs by a total of over  37 million. This provides real incentives for expansion and a substantial injection of capital for these priority commodities.The extra costs falling on the industry for all Review commodities this year are estimated at  40 million. In accordance with the Governments prices and incomes policy, agriculture, like other industries, is expected to meet part of any
increases in costs from increasing efficiency, assessed at  30 million, taking oneyear with another. Because of the fall in net output in 1968/69, the industry willnot have made in full the gain normally expected from greater efficiency. TheGovernment have decided that this year the extra costs will be met in large measure by increases in the value of the guarantees over Review commoditiestaken as a whole.Market stability12. Deficiency payments give the industry a firm assurance as to its totalreturn, but market stability is an important factor for forward planning, invest-ment and confidence. A good deal has already been done to secure orderlymarketing for most of the main Review commodities. The arrangements vary according to the nature of the problem. Thus, the cereals market is subjectto a minimum import price system backed, when necessary, by levies under the agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964; the Bacon Market Sharing Under-standing has recently been re-negotiated to provide more scope for competitivehome production; imports of butter are subject to quota restrictions; imports ofpoultry are limited by voluntary arrangements; ways are being sought of limitingimports of Cheddar and Cheddar-type cheeses; and the Government intendopening discussions with overseas suppliers for the introduction of a minimum import price scheme for eggs and egg products which they regard as an integral part of the new arrangements for eggs.13. The Government will continue to keep a close watch on the markets forother commodities, particularly those which are more sensitive to sudden changesin supply, such as beef. During the last year the Agricultural Departments havemade studies in consultation with the Unions of the possibilities of providinggreater market stability for fat cattle. The wider implications are now beingconsidered.Productivity14. The Government attach great importance to giving more encouragement to productivity within the ambit of present support for agriculture. The 1968Annual Review White Paper mentioned discussions between the Governmentand the Farmers&apos; Unions on this. These discussions have continued and talkshave also been held with the Landowners&apos; Associations. Particular attention has been given to the idea of streamlining and rationalising the present system of grants and subsidies to increase efficiency and encourage productivity. the aim would also be to reduce the paper work and effort which are now involvedfor farmers and the administrative costs. Under discussion as well are possible ways of improving the flow of technical and economic information from the research worker to the farmer. The Government intend to follow up theseinitiatives vigorously.The approach summed up15. To sum up, this year the Government have quite deliberately put specialemphasis on cereals, beef and pigmeat. They see the related expansion of thesemajor commodities as the solid base for advance by the industry as a whole.Other commodities have been considered with equal care. For example, forsheep last year&apos;s award has been reinforced; and milk producers will benefit from the stimulus to beef even though anything more than a neutral award for
milk is ruled out. Weight has also been given to the current income situation of the industry. Sharp as it has been, the cutback in income is no more thantemporary the outcome of circumstances which neither farmers nor Govern-ment had power to influence.16. The commodity determinations; the measures for market stability; thestatus of agriculture as an import; saver; its top priority within the credit ceilingalong with other lending which helps the balance of payments; the increasingbenefits flowing from Government expenditure on research and (he advisoryservices; and the proposals for rationalising grants and subsidies: all these are designed to set the industry (irmly on course, leased on (he underlying strengthand resilience of an efficient industry (hey should ensure recovery, expansion,productivity-and profit.11.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production17. The cereals harvest in 1968 was seriously affected by the weather and production of beef in 1968/69 was still suffering from the aftermath of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. because of this and a heavier use of inputs a fall of about 3 per cent in the volume of agricultural net output is expected in thecurrent farm year compared with 1967/68. The index of net output for 1968/69is forecast at 138, compared with revised figures of 143 for 1967/68 and 135 for1966/67 (average of 1954/55 to 1956/57 ^100). A similar trend is shown bythe rcbased index of net output.   (Appendix 1, Table K, page 29.)18. We expect to have less home-fed beef than in 1967/68, but the beefbreeding herd has continued to expand, if at: a slower rate than in recent years.The dairy herd, which has been recovering from the effects of the foot-and-mouth epidemic, is now again expanding satisfactorily. The sheep breedingflock while expanding in the hills has continued to decline in lowland areas.The pig herd is expanding and home production of pigmeat in 1968/69 shouldbe well up on the previous year. We have been getting more eggs and poultry.Exceptionally bad weather in the principal grain-growing areas has meantlower yields. So production of cereals has been markedly lower than in1967/68. The potato acreage fell, but despite some losses from Hooding,waterlogging and poor keeping quality, a surplus is expected. The sugar heetsituation remains satisfactory.Income19. Farming net income benefited from the weather in 1967/68 but was hit by it in 1968/69. Actual net income was  516 million in 1967/68. It isexpected to fall to  477 million in 1968/69. The decline in net income perfarm will be somewhat less than these figures suggest because the number of full-time farm businesses continues to fall. Adjusted for normal weather,however, net income would have shown a rise between the two years from 495 million to  509 million.   (Appendix II, Table A, page 30.)20. The latest figures on incomes for different types of farming are basedupon farm accounts for the year ended about mid-February 1968.   They show
thai in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the average income for all types of farming taken together improved substantially between 1966and 1967. The increase was most marked on cattle and sheep farms andsmallest, in general, on cropping farms. Incomes for some types of farm inNorthern Ireland have continued to reflect the disparity in average feedingstallscosts between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.21. Specimen figures of the changes in net income between 1966/67 and1967/68 are given in Appendix IV (page 35). Detailed figures for Englandand Wales are presented in this year&apos;s report on the Farm Management Survey?which comes out at the same time as this While Paper. Similar information for Scotland and Northern Ireland will be published later.22. As already mentioned, net income in 1968/69 is likely to be down. Butthe position will vary considerably from one part of the country to another and between different types of farming. A reduction in net income is expected in some areas, particularly oil cropping farms, but an increase is likely in other areas and on some types of livestock farms.Costs and Efficiency23. The cost of goods and services used in agriculture has gone up, the mainincreases being for labour and machinery (Appendix 111, page 34). at current levels of use, this adds about  40 million in a full year to the cost of producing Review commodities. This increase has been taken into account at the Review along with the annual gain in productivity, which is assessed,taking one year with another, at  30 million for Review commodities.24. Over the past decade, labour productivity (the volume of net output perman) has been rising at 6 7 per cent annually. In 1968/69, because of thedrop in net output, labour productivity is not expected to rise significantlyalthough the number of workers continues to fall.Cost of Agricultural Support25. Exchequer cost in 1968/69 is expected to be about  281 million. This isabout  20 million more than in 1967/68. It is a little less than the original estimate of  286 million as less will be paid on fat cattle, pigs and eggs, althoughmore will be paid on cereals and potatoes. The estimate for 1969/70 made before this Review shows an increase to  295 million, the main increases being on pigs and fertilisers. The present determinations are estimated to add afurther  23k million to this total, assuming the same forecast levels of output and market prices.   (Appendix V, Table A, page 37.)III.   Commodities ami Production GruntsBeef and Milk26. The Government have said that they want more beef from both the beef and dairy herds and they look for more efficient use of grassland and theretention of all suitable calves from the dairy herd.* &quot;Farm laconics in Buglimd and W;ilcs&quot;, H.M.S.O., price 16s. (kl.
27. The beef breeding herd continued to expand between June 1967 and Junel%8 but at a slower rate- just over I per cent than in the previous threeyears, during which the total increase was 16 per cent. In the year from june 1968 to June 1969 some increase in the rate of herd expansion is expected in response to higher market prices and the increased incentives for beef production given ai (he 1968 Annual Review.28. Despite the loss of an estimated 105,000 dairy cows in the foot-and-mouthepidemic, the dairy herd went up by 12,000 between June 1967 and June 1968.A large increase is expected between June 1968 and June 1969. By then the foot-and-mouth epidemic should no longer be affecting the size of the herd.20. Home-fed supplies of beef and veal are expected to drop by about 1.1 percent in 1968/69 (July/June year). This fall reflects an increase in calf slaughter-:ings in 1966/67 over the low levels of the two previous years, a reduction in imports of Irish stores and the effects of I he foot-and-mouth epidemic (bothdirectly on immediate beef supplies and indirectly through the need for extradairy replacements). Bui the underlying trend is upward and an increase isexpected in 1969/70. Imports dropped sharply in 1967/68 as a. result of restrictions put on during the foot-and-mouth epidemic; hut they have sincereturned to a little below previous levels.30. At present the dairy herd is growing fast enough to meet the product ionobjectives. The Government wish to encourage the breeding and retentionfor beef of all suitable calves. There has been a welcome reduction in Hie raleof calf slaughtering during the last year. The rate of expansion of the beefhero! has slackened ami needs to be accelerated. The Government consider thatthe industry should have more resources to push up tin; beef herd and toencourage the adoption by breeders, rearers ami In I tenets alike of improvedmanagement techniques.   So.....the guaranteed price for fat cattle will go up by 15s. Od. per ewt.;as a more direct incentive to improve productivity in the stickler herd, thebeef cow subsidy and the hill eow subsidy will both go up by  1 a head;and.....the stocking ratios will be improved where they apply to payment ofthese subsidies. The maximum ratio for the hill eow subsidy will infuture he one cow to four acres, instead of one cow to live acres, andthat for the heel&apos;eow subsidy will be one eow to two acres instead of onecow to two and a half acres.These changes should leave no doubt about the Governments determination toencourage beef product ion.31. With a larger dairy herd and a further slight increase in yields, total output of milk is expected to increase by some 45 million gallons in 1968/69.It is expected to go up again in 1969/70, for the same reasons.32. Sales of milk on the liquid market which had shown an upward trend, overthe previous ten years declined in 1968 to just below the 1966 level. Thisfollowed an increase in the price of welfare milk and (he ending of free milk for secondary schools.   The full effect of (hesc changes should have worked
itself out by the end of 1969 and the trend should again be up. The standard quantity is adjusted automatically for the change in liquid consumption.There will be a decrease this year of 34*8 million gallons, equivalent to a. decreaseof 0-39(1. per gallon in the guaranteed price.33; Technological and structural advances arc making milk production more efficient and output is rising. It would not be in the interests of this sectionof the industry for output (o go ahead faster than improving productivity,if the result were I hat the increased supplies could not be economically absorbed.It is, however, important that more calves suitable for beef should come fromthe dairy herd. The Government gave an assurance at the 1966 Annual Reviewthat, when determining the guaranteed price for milk, they would lake intoaccount the dilution of the average price received by producers as a result of expansion to gel more beef. The increase in the average size of the dairy herdbetween 1967 and 1968 has resulted in a dilution of 0-1 Id. per gallon, equivalent in terms of the guaranteed price to 0-13d. per gallon. (In a balance of all the considerations involved, (he Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 0-4d. per gallon. Allowing for the reduction in the standard quantity,the net ellect will be to leave the value of I he guarantee on milk unchanged.The higher guaranteed price for fat cattle should not only encourage I he releii-lioii of all calves from the dairy herd suitable for beef, bul also increase the returns lb milk producers&apos; on sales of such calves.3-1. As the selective expansion programme has been rolled forward, I heGovernment have decided to renew the assurance on the dilution of the poolprice for milk to cover the period of the extended programme;Sheep and Wool35. Sheep are important lo the husbandry of many lowland farms as well asin I he bills. Itul I he desired expansion in oilier products of lowland farmingwill exert continuing pressure on the laud and other resources available lorsheep. The Government want lo encourage greater productivity and growth in the hills and uplands lo ollsel tlie decline in lowland Mock numbers.36. Because of the pressure from other types of lowland farming I he nationalbreeding flock has gone down from I he peak reached in December 1965.Between December 1967and December 1968 there was a fall of 2 percent, aboutthe same as in I he year before. There are signs thai flocks in the hill ami up-land areas are increasing; the number of ewes qualifying lor I he hill sheepsubsidy has been going up steadily and expansion in the uplands is now beingfurther encouraged by the extension of I he subsidy in 1967. Itul Ibis increase isnot yet expected lo make up for the reduction in lowland flocks, so that a furthernet deci-ea.se is likely for the year lo December 1969.37. Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb for 1968/69;are estimated at some5\ per cent below the 1967/68 level. An increa.se in imports of about 4.1 percent is expected, so thai total supplies should lie about Ihe same. A further fall in home-fed supplies is expecled in 1969/70.
38. The encouragement given to sheep production in the hills and uplands atthe 1967 Review was followed up in 1968 by an increase in the guaranteed price for fat sheep. This increase in fatteners&apos; returns was designed to maintainadequate outlets for store stock at appropriate prices and to encourage farmerson upland grass farms to fatten themselves more of the lambs produced in the hills. To check the decline in production, these measures must now be followed up.   So the guaranteed price for fat sheep will go up by a further 1 id. per lb.39. To encourage the improvement of productivity on those hills and uplandscapable of carrying more stock, the maximum stocking ratio will be improvedwhere this applies to payments of the hill sheep subsidy. In future it will be two and a half ewes to the acre instead of two.40. The discussions on the criteria for determining the wool guarantee,which were mentioned in the 1968 Annual Review White Paper, have nowended. Market movements over the past two years have underlined the changes [that can occur in world prices for wool and which are inevitablyreflected in domestic wool prices. Under the current fifteen-year agreementwith the British Wool Marketing Board prices to producers are stabilised out ofa fund. This is financed by Government advances when returns from themarket are inadequate to meet the guarantee and by producer contributionswhen the guaranteed price is exceeded. But there has been a deficiency to bemet out of public funds in each of the fust four years. This situation could continue unless market prices rose substantially and it cannot be ignorbd by theGovernment in determining the guaranteed price for wool. At the same timethe Government recognise that the return from sales of wool is an important partof the income of sheep farmers, more particularly in hill areas. So they willcontinue to determine the guaranteed price for wool each year in the light of all relevant factors, including the level of support on fat lambs and hill sheep andthe requirements of general production policy. In spite of the large gap between the market price and the guaranteed price the guaranteed price willremain unchanged this year.Pigs41. Under the expansion programme the objective for pigmeat is two-fold.The United Kingdom is already virtually self-sufficient in pork and the Govcrn-mcnt want home production to meet the growth in demand. For bacon, theGovernment want the curing industry to get a larger share of the market by improving its productivity and competitiveness. The new Bacon MarketSharing Understanding should help towards this.42. In response to the incentives given at the last two Annual Reviews andthe widening of the middle band last year to avoid cuts under the flexibleguarantee system throughout 1968/69, the breeding herd has been recoveringsteadily from the down-swing in 1965 and 1966. In the year to December 1968the breeding herd went up by 7 per cent, the same rate as in the year before,and a further rise is expected in 1969. The number of pigs certified for theguarantee in 1968/69 (April/March) is estimated at 12-6 million, 5 per cent upon the year before.
43. Home pork production in 1968/69 (July/June) is expected to be nearly7 per cent up on 1967/68. Home bacon production is expected to be some220,000 tons, 10,000 tons higher than in 1967/68. Both pork and baconproduction arc expected to go up again in 1969/70.44. Under the flexible guarantee arrangements a &quot;middle band&quot; is fixed ataround the desired level of production. The effective guaranteed price goes upautomatically when pig production is forecast to fall below the middle bandand is cut when the forecast is above it. At the 1968 Annual Review it wasdecided to widen the middle band while the herd was growing in order to avoid any automatic cut in the guaranteed price on this account during the year.The Government said, however, that the lower limit of the middle band wouldbe raised again at the 1969 Annual Review so that the future interests of pigproducers and herd expansion would he protected.45. The Government want the industry to have the necessary confidence and resources to expand steadily, but they do not want a runaway expansion. the guaranteed price will be raised by 6cl. a score and both the lower and theupper ends of the middle band will be raised by a further 400,000 pigs. Thismeans that forecast production can rise to 14-3 million pigs before there is any cut in the basic guaranteed price, under (he flexible guarantee arrangements.It also means that if in the future production should start falling, incentiveswould apply more quickly. This fulfils the undertaking given last year.Details of the new arrangements arc given in Appendix VI, Part II (page 44).46. The stabilisation payments designed to give greater assurance to the bacon curing industry were continued during the financial year 1968/69. the agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 provided for the stabilisationarrangements to be more permanent. They will go on unchanged at first into1969/70 until more detailed consideration can be given to the best ways forthe industry to improve its productivity and marketing so as to supply more of the total demand for bacon. This is in line with the recommendations ofthe Worth committee* that any longer-term stabilisation arrangements shouldbe linked to the encouragement of improved organisation.Eggs .47. The United Kingdom is virtually self-sufficient in eggs. Demand isrising only marginally and the aim is to go on meeting it from home production.48. In 1968/69 production is expected to be 2 per cent higher than the recordlevel of 1967/68. Packing station throughput has however declined and theBritish Egg Marketing Board&apos;s average selling price, which fell to 2s. 9J-d. perdozen in 1967/68, is expected this year to go above the average of 2s. 1 Id. perdozen for 1966/67. Producer prices have been correspondingly higher. In1969/70 the average laying flock is expected to be slightly smaller but if average* The Bacon Curing Industry: Report of the committee of enquiry into the bacon curingindustry set up by the Economic Development Committee for Food Processing, national economic Development Office.
yields go on rising production should be about the same as in 1968/69.Following the removal of the obligation to stamp subsidised eggs, the market for the Board&apos;s eggs has been much stronger than a year ago.49. In December 1968 the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodannounced that the obligation to stamp subsidised eggs was being ended, lieannounced at the same time that the Government would set a limit to thetotal number of eggs in respect of which subsidy would be payable in 1969/70.The standard quantity for 1969/70 will be 651 million dozen of first qualityeggs sold through packing- stations. This is the same as the throughput off first quality eggs in 1967/68 which was the biggest throughput in any of thelast three years.50. In a further statement in January 1969 on the Report of the ReorganisationCommission for Eggs,* the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Foodannounced that the egg subsidy would be phased out over the next live yearsby reduction of the guaranteed price. It would be put on a flat-rate basis byabolishing the feed price formula and accelerating the phasing out of thepresent profit and loss sharing arrangements. So the feed price formula foreggs is being abolished from the beginning of the 1969/70 guarantee year.Also, the Governments share under the loss provision of the profit and losssharing arrangements is being reduced from 30 per cent in 1968/69 lo 10 percent in 1969/70; the profit and loss sharing arrangements will be abolished asfrom the beginning of the 1970/71 guarantee year. After allowing for thereduction in the Governments share under the loss provision in 1969/70, the guaranteed price is being reduced by 1-19d. per dozen.51. In line with their decision on hen eggs, the Government intend to phaseout the duck egg subsidy. So the guaranteed price is being cut by 0-38d. perdozen, the Governments share under the loss provision is being reduced from30 per cent to 10 per cent and the feed price formula is being abolished. the profit anil loss sharing arrangements will be abolished as from the beginningof the 1970/71 guarantee year.C &apos;erc(ils52. The Governments aim for cereals is expansion lo Ihe full extent thai istechnically possible and consistent with reasonable resource use and supportcost.53. In 1968 an increase of just over 100,000 acres in wheat was more thancounter-balanced by reductions of over 90,000 acres in barley and nearly50,000 acres in oats and mixed corn. Because of the exceptionally bad. weather,yields were low. Total production in 1968/69 is estimated at about 13-2 million tons, some 1-2 million tons lower than the record, production of 1967/68.Some increase in the wheat acreage is expected in 1969 but little change in the acreage of other cereals taken together. This reflects the set-back to productionthis year and. the difficult weather since Ihe harvest.   But yields should, be* Report of the Reorganisation Commission for Eggs (Grind. .1669), H.M.S.O., price 1 2s. 6d.
considerably belter, given normal weather. Imports of cereals in 1968/69 are estimated at a little below 8i million Ions; this is about i million tons morethan in 1967/68 and reflects the fall in home production.54. A much larger cereals acreage is needed if home production is to expandas desired arid meet the growing requirements of feed for the larger numbersof livestock. The guaranteed prices for the principal cereals were increasedfor the 1968 harvest but then the bad weather came. The Government havedecided that further incentives should be given to wheat and barley to ensurethat farmers have the resources and the confidence necessary for expansion.   so the guaranteed, price of wheat will go up by Is. 7d. to 29s. ()d. per cwl;the guaranteed price of barley will go up by 10d. to 26s. Od. per ewt; andthe standard quantity for barley, which might have been a brake onexpansion, will be abolished.There will be no change in the guaranteed price for oats.55. The target indicator prices for 1969/70 will be . Xd. per cwl. for wheat and 20s. lOd. per cwl. for bailey, &apos;...&apos;he:;e have been fixed in relation to theminimum import prices for the appropriate grain:, which were introduced on1st August 1968 to take account of devaluation (Appendix VI, Purl II, page 45).56. The Government have reviewed the scope for I he development of potentialbreak crops. The introduction of the grant of i&apos;5 per acre for Held beans for a.period of three years beginning in 1968/69 led to a large increase in I he acreageunder this crop, but the bad weather in 1968 reduced yields seriously. As a.result there is unlikely to be much expansion in 1969, but the value of the cropas a. break in the cereals rotation is now well recognised anil there appear tobe good prospects for the longer term. The Government have decided thillfurther study of the potentialities of other crops is necessary. The prospectswill be reviewed again later in the year in the light of experience in the 1969season.Potatoes57. The objective for mainerop potatoes continues to be thai, except in yearsof unusually low yields, home production should meet home demand in full.58. The discussions with the Partners&apos; Unions and Ihe Potato MarketingBoard referred to in paragraphs 53 and 55 of Ihe 1968 Annual Review WhilePaper led to new arrangements announced in July 1968. Under these, Iheprospective demand, and. Ihe trend, in yields will be reviewed each year. the acreage that would be consistent with Ihe policy objective will then be deler-mined and the Board will use its regulatory powers will) Ihe aim of holdingIhe Great Britain acreage to a figure in line with this. The objective for 1969is a reduction in the U.K. acreage to about 650,000 acres. Unless yields areunusually low, this should produce a crop sufficient lo meet home demand.59. These new arrangements for I lie future should help lo avoid, aparl fromexceptional years, excessively large surpluses such as I hose from Ihe 1964, 1965
and 1967 crops which gave rise to problems of financing market support. Forexample, in 1967, with an acreage of 708,000, there was a surplus of 625,000 tons.With 691,000 acres this year there is again a surplus in spite of the difficultharvest and losses in some parts of the country due to flooding and waterlogging.60. The problems of financing market support referred to above led to thespecial arrangements described in paragraph 56 of the 1968 Annual review white Paper. Under these, the Government agreed to meet the Board&apos;s shareof the cost of market support, for the 1968 crop up to a limit, of  1 million.This arrangement has worked; and little of the cost, of support buying in thecurrent season will have to be met by the Board. No special arrangement ofthis kind is proposed for support buying in 1969/70. Discussions with theBoard and the Unions on long-term arrangements are continuing.61. Because of increases in costs and the need to maintain an acreageconsistent with the policy objective the guaranteed price will go up by 5s. Od.per ton.Sugar Beet62. The level of demand for sugar is at best static. Committed suppliesunder the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and the yield from the existingsugar beet acreage now supply over 95 per cent of domestic sugar consumption.Against this background, the Government intend to maintain (he presentsugar beet acreage. There is no difficulty in gelling the national contractacreage taken up in full.   So there will be no change in the guaranteed price.Production Grants63. Fertiliser Subsidy. Proper use of fertiliser is essential if expansion is tobe achieved with maximum efficiency. Fertiliser usage has in fact: gone onrising. As a result, expenditure on the fertiliser subsidy has gone up. II isthe general policy to reduce the rates of subsidy in order to contain thesubsidy cost, but no cut was made last year and the estimated cost of thesubsidy in 1968/69 is some  33 million. The subsidy rates will now be reducedby  3 million over the year. In their determinations on the commodityguarantees, the Government have made allowance for this reduction.64. Lime Subsidy. There will be no change in the general level of Ihe limesubsidy. The Government will, however, continue discussions with the farmers&apos; Unions in the coming months on some details of the AgriculturalLime Scheme, including the relative cost of lime in remoter areas of Scotland.65. Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme. This scheme was introduced in 1965 and was extended for one year to 31st August 1969 at the 1968 Review.Applications arc still coming forward at the rate of some 1,200 a year andit is proposed to extend the scheme again for a further year to 31st August 1970.

In addition new statistical information which has become availableaffects the figures for 1967/68 and some earlier years.

The &quot; Departmental &quot; calculation is for years beginning 1st June.Note (ii). The figures in brackets for 1967/68 and 1968/69 are adjusted to normal weather conditions.Note (iii). The &quot;Departmental&quot; and &quot;raised sample&quot; estimates of aggregatefarming net income in Table A arc arrived at after making provision for depreciation.Net income is defined as the reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, and for the use of the occupiers investment.Note (iv). These two series of aggregate farming net income arc calculated indifferent ways. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimate is built up from statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm and its components are&quot; shown inTable B. The &quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts whicharc expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom.Both scries are of value in indicating the general trend of income but there are anumber of reasons why the levels of net income shown in the two series should vary.It is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individual causes of this variationand both estimates arc subject to a margin, of error. The farm accounts forming thebasis&apos;of the &quot; raised sample &quot; arc provided voluntarily by farmers through universities and Colleges of Agriculture in Great Britain and the Ministry of Agriculture inNorthern Ireland.   The sample is not fully representative, however, particularly as
regards pig, poultry and horticultural holdings and very large businesses. In additionmost farm accounts relate to cither a calendar year or an April-March year, theaverage year-ending dale being about mid-February. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimaterelates to a year ending 31st May. This difference in year-ending dales can give riseto a difference in trend between the two series, since the results arc alfeeted by weather and other conditions. The revised scries for the &quot; raised sample &quot; calculation isbased on a new raising method.Note (y). The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimates for aggregate net income include asprofit in recent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in ihe farm household. In oilier industries the corresponding sums are noi treatedas profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (vi). From the &quot; Departmental &quot; figures for aggregate net income certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter slock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Expenditure on these grants is not taken into account in calculating the total value of the guarantees. The ileiu &quot; Other &quot; under this heading includes grants in respect of livestockimprovement, bracken eradication, and fixed equipment for agricultural co-operatives,Note (iii). Genera! explanation of figures. The figures in 1, II, 111 and IV for years up to and including 1967/68represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures lor 1968/69 are the latest estimates (Hansard LUst January 1969, written answers, columns 387-388) of cash expenditure in the UnitedKingdom (Civil Estimates Class V, Voles 3, -\, 5, 6 and parts of Votes 2 and 7). The figures for 1969/70 are thosein the corresponding Civil Estimates for that year. They do not take account of the clleci of the determinationsin this White Paper. *Note (iv).   Explanation of particular figures.in) Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicatedand partly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.(h) Figures for milk exclude expenditure on school and welfare milk. Following the 1962 Annual review the retail price of milk was arranged so that neither a deficiency nor a surplus will arise, taking one year with another, from the implementation of the price guarantee.(c) Expenditure on tuberculosis eradication relates to bonus payments under the Attested Herds Scheme only and excludes compensation payments for slaughtered reactors.(d) Part of the payment of hill sheep subsidy due in 1967/68 was brought forward to 1966/67 prior to theintroduction of a change in the payment arrangements in 1967/68.(e) The investment inventive grants to agriculture were payable for the first time in 1967/68.   They replacedinvestment allowances and, unlike them, take the form of cash payments instead of tax concessions.(,f) The basis of the calculation of administrative expenses was changed in 1961/62 so that the figure for theearlier year is not comparable with later figures.Note iv). Estimated effect of determinations on Estimates 1969170. On the basis of the original assumptionsas to output and market prices, the estimated effect of the determinations set out in this While Paper, is a net increase of  23J million in the total estimated cost ( 29.S million) of agricultural support by the exchequer in 1969/70. This net increase is the result broadly of increases of  3 million on wheat,  -U million on barley, 12 million on cattle,  1A million on sheep and  8 j million on pigs, and decreases of  4 J million on eggs and IJ million on fertilisers.The net effect of the determinations on the estimates differs from the elTect on the value of the guarantees forseveral reasons; the more important are (hat the price guarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financialyear.Note (W). The Table excludes grants specifically for horticulture. The estimated cost of these, together withHorticultural co-operation and credit, is  6-6 million in 1968/69 and  8-1 million in 196.9/70,

Forcattle and sheep these are on a pre-determined seasonal scale and payments are subject toabatements and supplements under the graduated deficiency payments scheme. these arrangements should normally mean that the guaranteed price for the year is paid exactly;but circumstances can arise where marketings and prices vary from those forecast in such away that the producers&apos; average return exceeds the guaranteed price for the year. Becauseof the weekly basis of payment this can happen for cattle, sheep or pigs if market prices gohigher than the standard prices in some weeks and in others guarantee payments are made.For pigs, the method of calculating the guarantee involves an element of estimation and canresult in the producers&apos; average return differing slightly from the guaranteed price.US) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee and feed formulaarrangements.(c) The guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs are subject to the indicator price arrange-ments and the guaranteed price for hen eggs is subject to the standard quantity arrangements.id) The guaranteed price for milk is subject to the standard quantity arrangements and includes 0-25d. per gallon special assistance for compositional quality.(e) The guaranteed prices for wheat and barley are subject to the target indicator price arrangements.(/) In order to promote orderly marketing throughout the season, the guaranteed price for wheat is subject to the operation of a seasonal scale and the guaranteed price for barleyto arrangements whereby premiums are paid for barley delivered, after sale, in the later monthsof the cereal year and deductions made for barley delivered in the early months of the year.Part II.

Tor everymovement of 9 points from 1,000 points, the guaranteed price will be adjusted by3d. per score.
Eggs

8. Indicator Price Arrangements. In 1969/70 the indicator prices will remain unchanged at 3s. 1d. per dozen for hen eggs and 2s. 2d. per dozen for duck eggs. If, during 1969/70, the British Egg Marketing Board&apos;s average selling price for hen eggs or duck eggs is below the appropriate indicator price, the proportion of the difference to be met by the Government will be reduced from 30 per cent to 10 per cent.

9. End of the Feedingstuffs Formula. From 1969/70 the guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs will not be subject to adjustment in respect of changes in the cost of feedingstuffs.

10. Introduction of a Standard Quantity. If the number of hen eggs packed in l969/70 exceeds the standard quantity of 651 million dozen eggs referred to in paragraph 49 of this White Paper, the payment to the British Egg Marketing Board due in respect of each dozen eggs packed will be reduced by the proportion which the number of hen eggs in that year bears to the standard quantity. (But see paragraph 11 below.)

11. Import Compensation Arrangements. The import compensation arrangements for hen eggs will continue in 1969/70 on the lines set out in paragraph 14 of Part II of Appendix VI to the 1963 Annual Review While Paper (Cmnd. 1968).

Cereals

12. Barley Standard Quantity. As stated in paragraph 54 of this White Paper, the standard quantity for barley is being abolished as from the beginning of the 1969/70 cereal year. With the abolition of the standard quantity the rate of deficiency payment on barley in 1969/70 and subsequent years will be based on the difference between the guaranteed price and either the average market price or the target indicator price, whichever is the higher.

13. Target Indicator Prices. These prices are related to the current minimum import prices for the appropriate grains after allowing for handling differentials and quality differences. For the cereal year 1969/70 the target indicator prices will be 21s. 8d. per cwl. for wheat and 20s. 10d. per cwl. for barley.

Sugar Beet

14. For the 1969 crop the maximum acreage to which the guarantee will apply will be 427,400 acres in England and Wales and 15,600 acres in Scotland. The maximum acreage for the 1970 crop will be same as in 1969.
