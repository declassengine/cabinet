DRAFT REPLY FROM HMG TO THE REGIMEHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have given careful consideration to the Rhodesian Memorandum of 16 April.They note with regret that it contains no constructive proposals.The British Governments detailed comments are attached asan Annex to this Memorandum.    In a desire to avoid sterilecontroversy these have been confined to points of substance,though the British Government, in so limiting themselves, wouldnot wish in any way to imply that they accept the statements insection 2 of the Rhodesian Memorandum of 16 April.The most disappointing feature of the Rhodesian memorandumof 13 February is its entirely negative attitude on the questionof the second safeguard.    The British Government have explainedwhy they regard such a safeguard as essential.   They have repeatedly made clear their readiness to consider alternative proposals for the second safeguard provided that agreement couldbe reached on the other outstanding points of disagreement.    Nosuch proposals have been made by Mr. Smith and his colleagues.The British Government share the conviction expressed inthe Rhodesian Memorandum that a settlement is in the interestof both Britain and Rhodesia;    it was in this belief that they took part in the talks held in H.M.S. Fearless, and at Salisbury,in October and November of last year.    But such an agreement canbe founded only on a genuine and whole-hearted acceptance by the/Rhodesian

Rhodesian side of the Six Principles by which the approach of successive British Governments to the whole Rhodesian problem has consistently been governed.    Throughout the variousdiscussions which have taken place the British Government havemade it absolutely clear that they cannot contemplate any settlement which might undermine or weaken these Principles,which they regard as the fundamental precondition of thecreation of a multi-racial society in which Rhodesians of allraces can live and work together in freedom, dignity and peace.It is. the British Governments earnest hope that, before embarking on the course indicated in the last paragraph of the rhodesian memorandum of 16 April, Mr. Smith and his colleagues will reflect carefully on the alternative that is open to them./ANNEX

The British Government have the following detailed comments on the Rhodesian Memorandum of 16 April.It is not the case that, during his visit to Salisbury,Mr. Thomson introduced &quot;conditions never contemplated previously&quot;.All of the manor points of disagreement, which he outlined inthe House of Commons on 18 November, 1968, arose out of Rhodesiansuggestions for departing from the Fearless proposals, whichhad already been published.   If it is suggested that theseproposals &quot;provide for an acceleration of African politicalprogress, not envisaged under the 1961 Constitution&quot;, this is inno way inconsistent with the First Principle and the proposalsfollow the Tiger Working Document in doing so.    In any event,unlike the 1961 Constitution, both sets of proposals providefor 17 reserved European seats in the Legislative Assembly.There are only three points, represented as concessions inthe Rhodesian Memorandum of 13 February, which require comment:(a) the suggestion that, while the number ofEuropean seats in the Senate should heincreased by two (as compared with theFearless proposals), the Fearless figuresfor the Legislative Assembly should he leftunchanged;(b) the further proposal put forward in respectof the franchise and cross voting;Ac)

(c)   the indication that applications from individualpublic servants y/ho wished to apply forreinstatement could be examined on their merits.The British Government^ views on these concessions were set out in the British reply of 11 March.    The last of these concessions does not in any way commit the regime and does notindicate any acceptance on their part of the principle that,as part of a settlement, there should be a spirit on bothsides of &quot;forgive and forget&quot;.   The British Government have explained in their previous reply, why the second concessionis apparent rather than real.   The first concession is not of major significance.    Like the Fearless proposals it wouldprovide for a blocking quarter of one more vote than the bare minimum;   but in comparison with them it would involve an overall increase in European representation, for which noconvincing justification has been advanced.
