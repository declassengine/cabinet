ggPQgg. Ey THE OFFICIAL COmgrTBS^on the AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY&quot;I.     introduction.     The Committee was set up to produce for Ministers an assessment of theaircraft industry together with suggestions as to its future shape and sizehaving regard to the uncertainty surrounding the future of major aircraft projects (Concorde, Airbus and the nulti-role combat aircraft - MRCA) onwhich the prospective work-load of the industry so heavily depends.2.     Our detailed terms of reference were -&quot;To evaluate the implications for our industrial and technologicalposition and our defence of maintaining, - and conversely of ceasingto maintain, an advanced aircraft industry in this country;   and tomake recommendations on the broad structure and size of theindustry, including the question of public ownership, in the lightof the best assessment that can be made of the programme of theindustry over the next five to ten years, having regard to theprospects of European collaboration;   and to report as necessaryto the Ministerial Committee on the aircraft industry.&quot;3.     The main reasons for singling out the aircraft industry for special attention at -uhis timo are related to the close connection between the size of its order book and decisions by the Government.   In the first plo.eethe Government purchase.ses directly about 60 per cent of its output (mainlymilitary) and the size of the Government requirement has been affected by successive Defence Reviews.     In the second place, two of its major civilprojects (Concorde and a possible 250 seat subsonic medium aircraft (the medium aircraft)) will require large amounts of special assistance from theGovernment (which in the case of the Concorde will not be recoverable infull), and, as international collaborative projects, involve the Governmentin discussions with other countries.   The growth of public expenditure asa whole is being controlled in order to ensure that sufficient resources are left available to enable the continuing balance of payments deficit ofrecent years to be turned into a surplus of the order of  500 million per annum.     A review of the resources the industry would use if the throemajor projects all went ahead or would release to other uses if one ormore of the major projects did not go ahead raises a number of special problems affecting the future of the industry and of the other engineering industries.     The discussion of these problems in our report helps to throw-1-

some light on the decisions which Ministers will have seon to make aboutmajor projects, although decisions on the individual projects will also have to take into account factors special to each, including the nature ofany specific agreements entered into.4.     A detailed examination of the British aircraft industry was containedin the Report of the Plowden Committee (Cmnd. 2853) Qf December 19^5? whosegeneral conclusions and all but two of its recommendations were acceptedby the Government.   The present order load of the industry is in factconsiderably higher than was foreseen in 1965.   We have made a freshassessment of the industry and its problems &quot;but our conclusions on anumber of points are broadly the same as the Plowden Committee.   On three major questions the Plowden Committee cancluded -(i)   that the aim of policy should be to create conditions in whichthe aircraft industry can thrive with no more support orprotection,than that given to comparable industries in Britain;(ii)   that the size of the industry should be a reflection of theamount of work it succeeds in obtaining and the Governmentshould not do anything to maintain the industry at anartificially high level;(iii)   that only those projects, whether national or collaborative,which satisfy the most stringent tests of economic promiseshould be supported by Government funds, and beyond this our needs should be met by purchases from abroad or manufactureunder licence.5.     We approached our own task by considering the part the industry playsin the economy and the demand it makes on resources.   We have consideredthe degree of protection or assistance it receives in relation to otherindustries, the argument that substantial indirect benefits for the economyflow from the existence of the advanced technology of the aircraft industryand would &quot;be lost if the industry were to contract sharply, the argument that marginal releases of resources from the industry would be likely tomake an equal or greater contribution to the &quot;balance of payments in otherindustries where the degree of protection or assistance would be less,and the relationship between military production and civil production.-2-

conclusions. There is a difference of emphasis in the Committee on certain pointsbut a broad range of agreement in the key issues. The conclusions can besummarised as follows -(i)   There is a substantial world market for military aircraft anda rapidly expanding one for civil aircraft and aviation supplies.There is a significant United Kingdom requirement in both fieldswhich will need to be met from either home production orimports.   But the United Kingdom market for largo advancedaircraft is not large enough to provide an adequate basis for purely British projects.   The United Kingdom industry must therefore be employed on projects which compete effectively in the world market and have an adequate assurance of sufficient initial sales to justify the substantial investment of resources required.   These conditions can best be met inprinciple in the case of largo advanced aircraft, both civil and military, by collaborative projects,(ii)   Experience has shown that effective collaboration is not easy to achieve and sustain on these complex projects where it is mostnecessary.    Collaboration undoubtedly presents difficulties interns cf total cost, time scale and allocation of work (givenour dominance in the aero-engine field).    It also makes itnecessary to secure the agreement of our partners before deciding whether or not to continue with projects;    butpartnership involves Governments and not just industries, andpurely political considerations (especially those of otherGovernments) may enter.   But since the policy of collaborationoffers the best prospects for the United Kingdom industry for large advanced aircraft, every effort must continue to be madeto overcome these difficulties.   At the same time, the simplerand cheaper ends of the market should not be neglected,(iii)   In the civil field, joint projects, insofar as they are dependenton support from national airlines, encounter the difficulty that airlines are often unready to commit themselves to purchasesat an early stagehand arc not susceptible to Government pressure.Bcfire making decisions they need to know both the economios ofthe aircraft and the likely equipment of their competitors.-3-

(iv)   In the military field, where the Acquirements of the Europeanair forces are large, our aim must he to harmonise our requirements with those of our neighbour countries and todevelop and produce equipment in collaboration.(v)   Decisions on the industry should take the form of decisions on major projects.   They should be taken in the light ofthe application to them of agreed economic criteria andafter taking into account, as appropriate, military,political and technological considerations.(vi)   The Government should not seek to maintain the aircraft industry at any particular size.   The size of the industry should reflect the amount of work it succeeda la  btainingin the light of decisions on individual projects, whichshould be looked at on their merits.(vii)   If project decisions should lead to some contraction in the size of some parts of the aircraft industry, redeployment into other parts of the industry or into general engineering couldyield satisfactory results in terms both of output and thebalance of payments.   A major contraction, however, such as would threaten the continued viability of the industry as awhole, would have serious implications which would need themost careful consideration.

(viii) There are close links between the civil and military sides ofindustry and, so long as we have a defence requirement for producing advanced military aircraft in the United Kingdom, ourcivil industry will be assisted to remain competitive by virtueof the benefits which accrue through the sharing of overheadswith the military industry and through the technologicaladvances which occur in the military field.    It follows that ifthis defence requirement were to be changed so that we no longerproduced advanced military aircraft the competitiveness of ourcivil aircraft industry would be seriously affected in the longterra.   It is by no means clear that direct Government assistance insupport of civil research and development would be a viable, oreven a predictable, alternative;    and manufacture under licencewould give only limited benefit not related to development.(ix) A merger of the two airfrane groups - Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA)and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)     would be in the national interest.   The right course &apos;is. for the Government to continue touse its influence in support of any measures which seem likely tohelp bring this about.II.   PRESENT STRUCTURE. SIZE AID PERFORMANCE OF THE INDUSTRY7.     The United Kingdom aircraft industry, (of which a precise definitionis given by the Standard Industrial Classification 383) consists of over300 industrial establishments employing between them about 250,000 people.The industry comprises four main elements:(i)   Airframes, employing some 85,000 people;(ii)   Engines, employing some 74,000 people;(iii)   Equipment and components, employing some 74,000 people;    and(iv)   Guided weapons (GW), employing some 17,000 people.In addition a good deal of guided weapon and equipment work, particularlyin the electronics field, is undertaken by companies not forming part ofthe aircraft industry.   Of the total employment of 250,000 about150,000 are employed by the four main groups - the British aircraft corporation, 36,000;    Hawker Siddeley Aviation Limited, 32,000;   rolls royce Limited, 73,000;    and Westland Aircraft Limited, 6,500 - whosestructure is set out in the attached chart (Annex A).-5-

8. The value of output (  million at end 1966 prices) in the aircr.industry for the period 1957-58 to 1967-68 was as follows:	Government financod (Extramural)				Export market (civil and military)		R and D	Procurement	Assistance to development and production of civil aircraft	Home civil market		TOTAL1957-58 1958-59 1959-60 1960-61 1961-62 1962-63 1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 I	101 102 121 123 133 133 130 124 119 99 84	279 259 261 246 261 262 253 244 223 196 217 1          ..........	17 11 5 8 10 15 14 14 24 37 57	56 64 46 45 55 32 49 87 74 41 62 .	147 172 157 143 131 109 106 111 155 201 166 t	600 608 590 565 590 551 552 580 595 574 586NOTE:   This definition of output in terms of the value of sales to finalbuyers excludes duplication within the industry.     The value ofinstalled engines, for example, is included once only, (in the valueof the completed aircraft when sold in the home civil or export market).     Private venture R and D investment does not constitute asale (where Government financed R and D does).   This investment willlater be recouped in the sales of production aircraft and enginesto commercial customers.     Government assistance to the developmentof civil aircraft is repayable, generally only in part, from levies onsales.     The Government also receive a levy in respect of 3ale3,other than to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, of military aircraft whichhave been developed at Government expense.The present indications are that while exports will be higher in 1968-69,the-overall output of the industry will not significantly differ from thatof 1967-68.-6-

All repayments are lagged(and discounted) five years behind the year of assistance towhich they relate (e.g. the  2 million in respect of 1960-61represents repayments made in 1965-66, and so on) in recognitionof the fact that repayments received in any one year relate to assistance granted some years previously.-7-CONFIDENTIALNature, Typo and Scale of Government expenditure - both Civil and Military9.     It will be seen from the above table that Government expenditure inthe industry in respect of military R and D, military procurement and assistance to the development and production of civil aircraft accounts fora substantial part of the output of.the industry.     Government military expenditure represents payment for services andgocd3 specifically requiredby the Government, which in this respect stands in the same relationship to the industry as any other customer to its supplier.     As such, it is not comparable with launching aid, which is given to promising civil aircraft and aero-engine projects where the costs of launching are beyond theresources of the manufacturer.     Nevertheless the civil side of the industry has benefitted greatly from the considerable sums spent by the Governmenton military R and D and production and these nnst be taken intoaocount when considering the resources available to the industry andconsumed by it.10.   Direct support for civil aircraft consists of assistance to thedevelopment and production of civil aircraft plus a proportion (fixed at25 per cent and 40 per cent respectively) of the cost of the Royal aircraft establishment (RAE) and the National Gas Turbine Establishment (nGTE).

CONFIDENTIAL

11. The substantial increase Government assistance in recent years is directly attributable to the Concorde and the above figures illustrate what a largo proportion of Government assistance is accounted for by this project. But it should be noted that the original decision to proceed with Concorde and the recent decision to continue with it for the time being were taken primarily on non-economic grounds. If Concorde had not been developed, other more economic projects also calling for Government assistance might then have been developed in its place or the size of the industry reduced.

12. A table comparing the level of Government assistance towards civil aircraft with the Government aid received by other selected industries is at annex B. Two examples, Concorde and nuclear energy, stand out as projects which, if the full amount of Government subsidy related to sales in subjected to discounted cash flow analysis, are clearly not economic. Support for the other recent civil aircraft projects is shown to be much greater than for other engineering industries but, provided the projects are reasonably successful, somewhat below that for agriculture as a whole.

13. The comparison at Annex B however does not take account of any recoveries of launching aid. So far the amounts repaid have been small. But in practice repayments are likely to be spread over a longer period than the assistance so that relating one year&apos;s assistance to one year&apos;s payments (even with a time lag) is likely to give a false picture. A clearer picture is obtained by deducting payments from assistance, aircraft by aircraft. On this basis, and comparing the Government&apos;s loss with the estimated not foreign exchange benefit taking account of the effects of devaluation, recent aircraft have been as follows:

Implied Subsidy % Assumed Number Sold

VC.10 13 37 (in addition 14 VC 10s were sold to the RAF)

Trident I, IE, IIE 15 48

BAC 111 7 220

Rolls Royce Engines 1.5 -

Concorde 43 150

(Forecast) 75 90

NOTE: (i) the total Government financed R and D Costs have been used from the start of the projects in establishing the implied subsidies;

(ii) the method of calculating the implied subsidy is shown at Annex C.



The   average implied subsidy (unweighted), excluding Concorde and anyunrecovered R and D costs borne by the companies, is thus about 10 per centon revenue from sales (either exports or import saving).        The impliedpreference figures for Concorde, ignoring the expenditure prior toDecember 1968, if. as follows:Implied Preference Assumed number soldk3f^65fo 7016^-29^0 130NOTE:   The lower figures are derived from the basic development costwhile the higher figures including the contingency provisionare intended to cover major setbacks in development.Comparison betweeen the Aircraft and other Engineering Industries inthe United Kingdom.14.   In order to form a view of the relative importance of theaircraft industry to the economy, we have compared it with certain other engineering industries.     The main conclusions which emerge fromthe comparative statistics given at Annex D are -(i)   In the latest census of production year 1963, aircraftemployed 253,000 people;   about the same as electricalmachinery, radio and electronics and shipbuilding;60 per cent of the motor vehicle industry (Table 1).(ii)   The industry employs about 14 per cent of all the qualifiedscientists and engineers in engineering (compared with about 8 per cent of the whole labour force in engineering).It accounts for nearly 50 per cent of all engineering^ R and Dexpenditure.     R and. D expenditure on aircraft makes up morethan 25 per cent of gross output, compared with only  per cent in the rest of engineering (Table 3).-9-

(ill)   In 1963 not output, per head in the aircraft industry,after subtracting unrecoverod launching aid on civilprojects, was slightly below tho average for allengineering industry, but higher than electrical machinery,telegraph and telephones or shipbuilding (Table 1).(iv)   Exports per head in 1963 were below the average for theengineering industry,.     But between 1963 and 1966 exports for aircraft increased proportionately more than the rest of engineering and in 1966 the aircraft industry was up to theaverage level (Table 1).(v) The return on capital employed of the firms in the aircraft industry ranges for the most part between 5 per cent and15 per cent or more (Table 2). Even after subtractinglaunching aid on civil projects (which is treated in thofirms&apos; account as revenue and may bo unrecoverable) thisreturn, although behind the leaders, compares favourably with the general run of engineering firms.13.   Tho growth record of the aircraft industry in recent years has beenloss than that of other industries, in part, because of the fall in defencedemands.     For example, in tho period 1958-1966 the aircraft industryachieved a production growth of 11 per cent as compared with 57 per cent for the electrical engineering industry, 49 pen cent for the mechanicalengineering industry and 36 per cent for all manufacturing industries.16.   One other aspect of the aircraft industry should be noted.It has had a tendency to under-estimate the cost of individual projocts.This tendency is not peculiar to the British aircraft industry(the American industry has similar examples of cost escalations).The aircraft industry, however, undertakes an unusually large proportionof technologically advanced work whose eventual cost is particularly difficult to estimate accurately in advance.     In the past cost escalationhas been due partly to undor-oatimation of tho complexity of the work involved and partly to alterations during development to tho originalspecification.-10-

-11-Comparison with the Aviation Industries of Other Co-un-bries17,   We have also attempted to form a comparison of the United kingdom industry with that of its main competitors.   The statistical information available which is set out at Annex E is incomplete and may not all be ona comparable basis.   But it does enable the United Kingdom industry to beput in perspective among the other aircraft industries in the world.Basically the suppliers of aviation equipment to the non-Communist marketcan be divided into three main groups, the United States, the UnitedKingdom and Prance, and the other countries of Western Europe and Canada.The United States industry is on any basis of comparison by far thelargest.   It has supplied approximately 85 per cent of all the aircraft at present in service in the Western World and the estimated total valueof its production in 1967 ( 5,950 million) was very nearly ten times thetotal turnover of the United Kingdom industry, fifteen times that of france  and over fifty times that of any other European country.   It is a competitive and flexible industry sustained by extensive and varieddomestic requirements for civil and military equipment and heavilybacked by the United States Government&apos;s expenditure on military R and D.18.   The United Kingdom and Prance in the next group also have industriesthat are experienced in most aspects of aviation technology (althoughPrance lags behind both the United States and the United Kingdom inadvanced aero-engine technology) and are also backed by government support in some of their civil programmes.   Their domestic markets are,however, small for both military and civil equipment and they need tosell a higher proportion than the United States of their turnover inexport markets in order to recoup their research and production investment.19-   The other countries of ViTestern Europe with aviation industries(principally West Germany, Sweden, Holland and Italy, although Belgium,Switzerland and Spain also have production facilities) have experience ofproduction but less of development (and very little in advanced aero-engine development), have smaller industrial units and depend heavily on external suppliers of specialised components.   The Canadian aircraft industry is also relatively small, and native design work is restricted to a few specialised areas.   Financial control of the industry restslargely in United States hands and much of its production work arises fromthe 1959 defence production sharing agreement with the United States.

-12-CONFIDENTIAL20.   The United Kingdom&apos;a main competitor is the United States industry.Comparisons between the development and. production coats of British and american aircraft are difficult to make:   coats in any case vary widelywithin each industry.     The efficiency of the United Kingdom aircraftinduatry ia currently being examined by a joint Government/IndustryCommittee under the Chairmanship of Mr. H. St.J. Elstub, managing director of HI.21.   In any comparison of aviation industries, two striking facts emerge.First, the high risks and costs involved in large aircraft projects,offsetting the great opportunities.     Second, the dominance of the UnitedStates industry in tho world market.     The United States starts with theadvantage of having a large domestic market which gives it long productionruns and so enables it to quote keen prices.     The total resources avail-able to the United States industry are 3uch that it3 lead tines areshorter than those of its competitors, so it can also quote betterin-service dates.     United States aircraft provide at present some80 per cent of the world airline fleets and firms such as Boeing havebuilt up close ties with their customers.     Some airlines, for example,operate at present a wholly Boeing fleet.     Mixed fleets present greaterlogistic problems and some airlines may in consequence prefer to dealwith one supplier who can provide the full range of aircraft they require.While therefore the United Kingdom industry should through collaborativeprojects be able to widen the basis of its market, it will face intensecommercial pressure from the United States industry which is clearlystrongly entrenched in the market;   thus the risk associated with the launching of new aircraft is very high.22.   While collaboration offers the best possibility of staying in themarket for the larger and more sophisticated aircraft it is not withoutits own problems.     Total costs increase (though each country&apos;s share willbe less than for a single-handed project) and the additional administra-tive problems make time scales particularly vulnerable.     Tho dominantposition of the United Kingdom aero-engine industry adds to the difficultiesof agreeing on allocation of work (since our potential partners aredisinclined to have U3 lead on both airframe and engine).     Even nationalairlines are likely to show reluctance to acquire tho products of Europeancollaborative schemes, unless and until they aro satisfied that these will prove equally profitable, as compared with their competitors;   factors ofcompatibility and timing are of importance to them.     Finally, collabora-tive projects necessarily have a high political content.

23,   One other aspect should be noted.     The United States industry isthe *nly *ne which produces a full range of aircraft.   The United kingdom is no longer in the long range large sub-sonic (e.g. Boeing 747) field.Requirements for these aircraft are being met and will in future bemet by purchases from America.     To that extent, the United Kingdom&apos;independence in aviation supplies is already limited.Asse^ssment,J^fjjjjbrld Markets24o   There is a rapidly expanding world market for aircraft and aero-space equipment.       The International Civil Aviation Organisation (iCAO)estimate that scheduled passenger traffic is likely to grow by12 per cent per annum over the next ten years.   The &quot;Ministry of Technologyconsider this estimate to be a little optimistic and predict an overallgrowth rate for scheduled passenger traffic tef 11 per cent per annum.The Ministry of Technology also assume that freight traffic will continueto grow at a rapid rate, particularly on long haul routes and that themean growth rate will be between 16 per cent and 18 per cent per annum(ICAO predict a freight growth rate between 10 per cent and 20 per centwith a most probable figure of 15 per oeni).     Talcing these traffic growthforecasts, it is estimated that the world demand for new (i.e. additional)civil aircraft in the next ten years to meet traffic growth and replaceretired aircraft will be equivalent to the output of about 6,000 mediumhaul 100-seat subsonic aircraft.     Distributing this demand between thevarious aircraft categories and making an allowance for initial and continuing spares, the value of the world market for civil aircraft overthe next ten years is estimated to be  15,000 million (excluding theSino/Soviet bloc).    Of this,  7,000 million would be outside the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom; the present dominance if the UnitedStates industry in these markets has been discussed in paragraph 21atove.25.   The size of the military market is more difficult to predict.   Butan analysis of the military market over the next ten years carried out^jfor the Ministry of Technology and the Society of British AerospaceContractors, by the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates tho value oftho market outside the Utitod States, and United Kiigdoa and theCommunist blood at about  8,500 million.-13-

TIT. FUTURE REQUIREMENTS AND FORECAST PRODUCTION - POTENTIAL EXPORTS26.   In forming an assessment of the likely programme of the industry overthe next five to ten years, we have taken Ministry of Technology assessments.They envisage in the mid-1970s a United Kingdom requirement, defence and civil, of the order of  U00 million a year to be met from United kingdom production or from overseas.   Export assessments are clearly more speculativehut exports seem likely to be of the order of  250- 350 million ayear (details are in Annex F).   Deducting requirements which we are committed to meeting from overseas (directly or as our contribution to joint projectaircraft) the Ministry of Technology would argue from this a balance ofpayments stake in the industry (import saving/export earnings) of 500*5600 million a year0   To soe thio in perspective howeverr regardmust be paid to the likelihood of the resources used being able to contribute to the balance of payments in alternative uses (see paragraph 31 below).27.   Two points should be noted about these requirement figures.   First, theUnited Kingdom production forecasts hinge critically on the Concorde and the medium aircraft;   together they account for almost a fifth of the totalaircraft production over the next decade.   Concorde alone accounts for nearly a seventh.   Towards the latter half of the period the proportion is much higher, Concorde alone accounting for more than a fifth of all production in1974-75, the medium aircraft for a further ninth and the two together for about a third0   Secondly, the industry is vulnerable to reductions ofmilitary requirements, and although the order book is healthy (recent outshave fallen almost entirely on overseas purchases), there is serious shortageof design work threatening.   Unless new projects involving substantial designwork are forthcoming, the level of production will fall away in the late1970s and 1980s.IV.   IMPLICATIONS OF AN ADVANCED1 INDUSTRY - BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, defence and TECHNOLOGY28.   The airoract industry embraces a wide range of scientific and engineeringskills.   It covers aerodynamics, materials, structures, hydraulics, instru-ments,-propulsion, fuels, electrics and electronics.   The firms supplying theaircraft industry are to be found across a wide spectrum of British industry.The exacting standards and advanced technology of the aircraft industry are inconsequence spread not only to closely-linked industries such as electronics,computers and telecommunications, but across a wide sector of Britishindustry generally.   The leading electronic companies in particular have-*14-

undoubtedly benefited in certain fields from having to work to the high standards of technology set by the aircraft industry.     But such high standards are not necessarily conducive to optimum competitiveefficiency in the electronic products which represent the bulk of world trade.     Our electronic companies, for example, have proved vulnerable to competition from the electronic industries of countries which do not possess advanced aircraft industries (e.g. Germany and Japan) and whichhave concentrated on less sophisticated products with more rapidly expanding markets.29.    In assessing the economic contribution of any industry to the nation,aocount must bo taken of the value of its resources in alternative uses. this cannot be direotly assessed, although net output per head, return on capital and export performance may be some guide.     Other special considerations which are advanced in the case of the aircraft industry are as follows -(i)   There are expanding world markets at stake involving notonly aircraft but all form3 of equipment for aviation andspace and the industries producing these could not continue without an industry producing aircraft,(ii)   An indigenous source of supply for part of our Defence equipment is essential.     Without it we should be compelled to meet our requirements for military aircraft from overseas.    We should then have to forego the ability to develop aircraft for national defence and our bargaining position in negotiatingthe purchase of foreign aircraft could be substantiallyweakened.     We should also be dependent on overseas supplies in the matter of spares and support and o-ould face restrictionson the use of aircraft and in some qircu:astances on foreignpolicy.(iii)   The industry produces a valuable technological stimulus tothe economy, to the nation as a whole and to certain keyindustries,   e.g. electronics, in particular, the significance of which is over and above the indicators of a directcontribution to the economy a3 measured by net output and balance of payments contribution.     If the case for an aircraft industry is accepted on other grounds, these indirect benefits are a bonus- which could not be ignored.     If the case for an aircraft industry does not stand up on other grounds alone,then it would be necessary to take into account both the direct and indirect costs of obtaining these bonuses and thepossibility that the benefits might be obtainable more cheaplyby direct investment in the other industries concerned.-15-CONFJDENTIAL

30,   Ho one is proposing that we should consider abolishing- the airframeindustry as a direct act of policy.     We discuss the possibility of ournot having an advanced industry simply because it could be a oontingontconsequence of the decisions Ministers have to take in relation to the major projects.     If the appraisal of Concorde and the medium aircraft concludesthat they could not be justified in the light of economic and other considerations, the export prospects of the industry would be less favour-able than the global figures given above and the contribution to the balanceof payments substantially lower.     Given the dependence of the industry forthe next ten years on these two projects and the relevance (see Section VIbelow) in the longer term of advanced military capability for the viabilityof the industry, the general figures we have given of output and exports donot have a validity for future years which is independent from the up-to-datedetailed assessments which are to be considered in due course of each of the major projects and which will contain the latest available assessment of the likely orders etc.     This has a bearing on any comparison we try to make ofthe value of resources in existing and alternative uses, since the value tobe put on the continued existence of experienced management/production teamand on customer goodwill depends very largely on its ability to producecommercially successful projects.31,   Assuming however that we had to contemplate not having an advancedindustry, a switch of resources should, at any rate in the longer term,result in a  balance of payments contribution at least as good as that whichwould be made by an advanced aircraft industry.     The resulting contribution would be less expensive in terms of scarce resources and Governmentsubvention;   and would not be subject to the same degree of risk.     the technological &quot;fallout&quot; from the industry would however be diminished at the outset, although the benefits that have accrued in this way in the pastcould probably be replaced in due course by more direct investment in theindustries concerned.     The length of the longer term would largely dependon how short the other engineering industries were of the resources inquestion at the time the aircraft industry was running down;   a high levelof world trade would be an important   factor.     Past experience of aircraftcancellations and forecast trends in engineering output and productivitysuggest that the majority of redundant skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers should be readily absorbed in the engineering industry.Absorption of professional engineers might be more difficult;   and there-16-

would be waste arising from the dispersal of design and Qajaagenent teamsand of specialised capital assets.   (These issues are further disoussedin Annex G.)   As regards non-economic considerations, so long as thereis a military requirement for advanced aircraft, there is no way ofcircumventing the military and political risks of complete dependence on foreign suppliers,320   The impact on the general technological standing of the country alsohap to be considered.   A decision not to retain an advanced aircraft industry could have a general dampening effect on the morale of those working inother advanced technological industries - the report on the Brain Drain(Cmnd. 3417) considered that the number of aircraft cancellations had been responsible for sapping the confidence of the country1s qualified manpower in the long-term future of British technology and science.   It might also have a damaging effect internationally.   Aircraft are one of the for/ areas of active collaboration with Europe and a field in which we have much to offer.A decision to abandon this advanced field could be taken to mean that we nolonger had the resources or the will to stay in the forefront of an advanced technology;   and it could well impair our efforts to build up a Europeantechnological community.   What the attitude of European countries would beto a deliberate step of this kind by us is however very difficult to predictand it might give a quite different impression in some quarters,33.   There is not a close association between possession of an advancedaircraft industry and either balance of payments success or economicviability.   The countries who are frequently being pressed to revalue their currencies because of their excessive competitive power do not possessan advanced aircraft industry though some of then now wish to enter this field, notably Germany and Japan,-17-

v-     ^RELATIONSHIP DETOfEM THE AIKFRAME AND AER0-EN&amp;-INE INDUSTRIES34-   It is in the aero-engine sector of the aircraft industry that theinternational reputation of the United Kingdom stands highest, andRolls Royce, which in effect is the United Kingdom aero-engine industry,ranks as one of the two largest and most successful aero-engine companies in the world (the other being Pratt and Whitney of the United States).Over the past four years aero-engines have accounted for some 4-0 per cent of the total output of the aircraft industry and of the  400 millionworth of firm aero-engine orders currently on hand more than half are for overseas customers.     Rolls Royce&apos;s current projects are as advancedas any and in some sectors are the most advanced in the world.     their prospects for obtaining an increasing share of the world1s husinossare good.35.   Aero-engines have, through the possibility of incorporation in foreignaircraft,a greater variety of outlets than the airframe side of the industry.While the United kingdom&apos;s dominance in the engine field in Europe make sit difficult for the United Kingdom Industry also to obtain airframedesign lead in collaborative projects, it is however doubtful whether in the long term the United Kingdom could maintain its position in the engine field without a healthy airfraao industry aasooiated with it which couldplay an active part in advanced developments.     Engine development tobe successful has to be designed to meet the design requirements of the airframe so as to achieve the most satisfactory combination of per-formance and reliability.     Changes in airframe performance can requirechanges in engine performance and vice versa.     This invariably results in a compromise between airframe and engine performance.     The airframeand the engine manufacturers therefore need to work in the closestassociation in order to obtain the optimum performance.     This isnecessary not only in the early conceptual phases but right, throughoutthe subsequent phases of development, production, and in-serviceexperience.-18-

36.   The existence of a domestic airframe industry with which they havoover the years &quot;built up a close working relationship and whose naturalpreference is for British engines is an important factor in Rolls Royce&apos;business.     The United Kingdom engines which have teen incorporated inforeign aircraft have for the most part been developod in conjunctionwith British airfrano manufacturers and tried out in British air-frames,so that foreign purchasers have been able to have confidence in theirperformance and reliability.     Although the IIB211   was selected for thoLockheed airbus without a prior British application one of the factors in Lockheed&apos;s decision was undoubtedly tho reputation which Rolls Roycehad built up over the years on engines which had been flown in british aircraft.     Over the long term it would be unwise to rely on repetitionsof the RB211    success or on the United States market as a secure outlet.Rolls Royco need a sound &quot;homo&quot; base (i.e. United Kingdom and European)for their products,,      Unless and juntil there can be confidence thatthe European airframe industry generally will be similarly pro-disposedin favour of British engines, the loss of tho support of the United Kingdomairframe industry could only be harmful to Rolls Royce.     At the same timethe United Kingdom&apos;s negotiating position in European collaborativeprojects would bo compromised by any substantial weakening in ourairframe industry.-1 SI-CONFIDENTIAL

TO&apos;   KSLATIUNSHIP BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVIL AlfiCBAFT .PRQ&amp;HAHME:KJLEVANCE OF ADVANCED MIXJ^AIg .CAPABILm*37o   The Committee are agreed that the case for retaining an advancedmilitary design capability rests solely on our defence requirement for theproduction of advanced military aircraft;   and that once such a capabilityhad been abandoned there could be no question of reinstating it except at considerable cost and over a long time.     The Committee are also agreed thatthe possession by a country of an advanced military design capabilityprovides considerable benefits to its civil aircraft industry.     A note onthe meaning of advanced design in military aviation and the question offall-out from military to civil aircraft technology is at Annex J.     Thisindicates that technological advances inherent in the development of military aircraft are likely to be of continuing relevance to civil aircraft acrossthe whole field of air-frames, engines, systems and equipment,,     Thus, solong as we have a defence requirement for producing advanced military aircraft in the United Kingdom^ the competitive position of our civilindustry will be assisted by the benefits which accrue through   the sharingof overheads with the military industry and through the technologicaladvances which occur in the military field.     In the Committee1s view thisis a necessary, though by no means sufficient, condition of thecompetitiveness of the civil industry on anything approaching its present scale and range,38.   On the assumption that advanced military design is continued and on present estimates of future needs, it is expected that the United kingdom would maintain one military design team in the mid-1970s.     In continuanceof present practice, this team would be fully aware of civil requirements and would arrange for a maximum interchange of information with the civilside.39.   If our defence policy were changed so that we no longer producedadvanced military aircraft, a new situation would arise progressively andin the long-term the ability of our civil aircraft industry to compete withmajor producers in countries still producing advanced military aircraft would be seriously affected.     Although it would continue to exert pressures on its own for technological advances, it would be bound, through comparativelack of funds, to fall behind its competitors who enjoy the indirectsubsidisation provided by a national military advanced design capabilityand facilities for testing improvements in technology through their application to military aircraft entering squadron service.-20-

40.   In this situation it would in theory be open to us to replace themilitary &quot;subsidy&quot; by a direct Government assistance towards the necessarycivil research and development expenditure.     In practice the Committeeare far from clear whether assistance on the necessary scale would be madeavailable or would be economically justified.     They also recognise that even if it were we should still lack the benefits from being able to tryout new techniques in extensive flying of military aircraft.     Analternative might be to produce military aircraft under licence as is done, for example, in Germany, Japan and Holland.     While this would give us some benefits as regards production technology, it could not provide the range of benefits obtainable from retaining a design capability foradvanced military aircraft.-21-

VTZ.   CONSEQUENCES OF ABAWBOWMMT OF CONCORDE. I33DI0H AIRCRAFT. ANDApVANCED MILITARY CAPABILITY2i.1,   The importance of an advanced military design capability has beendiscussed above.   This capability for the next five to ten years would be largely taken up by the nulti-role combat aircraft (if it comes to fruition)which it is planned to develop with the European consortium.   In additionto this aircraft, the industry&apos;s programme hinges critically on the concorde and the medium aircraft.   We have therefore studied in somedepth the oonsequences of the abandonment of all or any of these projects and the effect on the viability of the industry0k2.   Clearly the cancellation of more than one of these major projects *could call in question the   viability of an aircraft industry of the size and structure as exists today in part because design/production teams couldnot be kept in being, and in part because the reasons which have led to the cancellation would almost certainly include either serious doubts about the technological aspects of projects or about future sales prospects, either ofwhich could call in question the whole competitiveness of the industry during the period immediately ahead.     It would be premature to reach anyconclusion on this aspect of the question in advance of the special apprai-aals.     We have however made an assessment in the most general terms (Annex H).VIII;   CRITERIA FOR THE INDUSTRY43.   We are still at best many year3 away from a common European procurementpolicy, and we cannot be sure that it will ever come into being.     However,the policy of collaboration offers the best prospects for the UnitedKingdom industry for large advanced aircraft;   and the Government have todecide on the criteria for the support of aircraft projects.     The futureof the industry is largely governed, as noted above, by decisions on ahandful of projects.     These projects all raise important problems ofpolicy including in the case of the advanced military combat aircraft what might be termed &quot;the cost of irreversibility.     If advanced military capability were abandoned, it would take at least a decade to build it up again and then only at enormous cost.     In thi3 sense, a decision toabandon this capability would therefore for all practical purposes beirreversible.     We nevertheless consider it important that these projectsshould, in so far as possible, be assessed against specific economiccriteria to establish their benefit to the economy.-22-

Civil Projocts44.    Officials of the Departments principally concerned have agreed a standard procedure to be used in the assessment of civil aircraft projects.This procedure involves detailed assessment of tho markeb prospects for an aircraft project and measurement of the national resources which need to be devoted to the project and the Government finance involved.     The assess-ment would conclude with a figure for the rate of preference implied in the project in terms of both national resources and Government contribution.Both are important but the national resources figure is the more fundamental.     In calculating the rate of preference it is essential thatthe market assessments and the possibilities of cost escalation must bothorough and mu3t be undertaken on a realistic basis.45*   The evolution of a standard procedure for the economic assessment ofalroraft projects will not do away with the problem of deciding on themaximum rate of preference which is acceptable.     This is an importantissue of economic strategy and involves taking a view on the degree of balance of payments constraint at tho date when the project is likely toby yielding most of its import savings046.   In addition to the r&amp;xo of preference included, it will also benecessary when considering whether or not to support individual projects to take into account our military and political objectives, such as our relationship with the European Economic Community (e.c.) and the position regarding European technical collaboration.Military Projects4?-   The factors involved in the procurement of military aircraft are moredifficult to evaluate than in the civil field.     Yfe consider that neverthe-less the same procedure which has heen prepared for civil aircraft should so far as possible be followed in the military field.     But in addition itwill be necessary to tako into account not only operational needs, thobalance of payments and potential sales to other countries, but alsoconsiderations such as -(ij   the desirability of having the source of supply under control;(ii)   the possibility and desirability of collaborative production;   and(iii)   the likely technical benefits of work on advanced military aircraft.-23-

So far as (ii) is concerned, the decision to concentrate our defence effort on Europe has largely removed the need for us to possess aircraftdesigned to fulfil a worldwide role and has thus made the prospects of collaboration brighter.IX-     THE SIZE Off THE INDUSTRY48.    It would,, we consider, be a mistake to approach the future of theUnited Kingdom aircraft industry in terms of its &quot;continued existence&quot;,for this suggests that the issue is a choice between continuing an industry of about the present size and shape or having no aircraft industry at all.As we have suggested earlier, the question is a different one; how, inthe case of the aircraft industry, should we fulfil the general require-ment that the nation&apos;s economic resources be used in an optimum manner?Thus we should have no preconceived ideas as to the desirable size ofthe aircraft industry.   Each aircraft project should be judged bycriteria on the lines we have suggested, and the size and shape of theindustry should depend on the number of projects which pass these tests.49.    The result might be that the industry tended to expand, to remain the same size or to contract.   As with any industry, a change in its size could cause problems if it proceeded very fast.   Naturally, ifit looked as though the load on the aircraft industry was falling off at a rate which would cause redeployment problems (as in,  say coalmining)that issue would need to be faced as and when it arose.    But there iscertainly no expectation that the establishment of criteria for new aircraft projects would lead to the extinction of the industry.X.     STRUCTURE AND OWNERSHIP50.   While the size and shape of the industry should depend on decisions on projects, encouragement should continue to be given to measures of rationalisation inside the industry designed to secure the optimum useof resources.    The industry, as described in paragraph 7, comprisesfour main elements.    These are airframes, guided weapons, engines andequipments, and components.   While these four main elements are closelyinterdependent and all depend to a lesser or greater extent upon Governmentcustom and financial support, it is the circumstances of the two main air-frame (HSA and BAC) and guided weapons groups (Hawker Siddeley Dynamicsand BAC(GW)) which give rise to special problems.-24-CONFIDENTIAL

Airfr antes51 .   The development and manufacture of airfr antes is dominated hy thetwo main groups - HSA and BAC.   The other main companies making up the airframe industry are Westlands, specialising in helicopters and hovercraft,Short Bros, and Harland of which the Government is a majority shareholder,Handley Page, Britten Norman, and Beagle which has been acquired by theGovernment.   HSA!s and BAC1s sales, however, account between them for some85 per cent of the airframe industry&apos;s turnover, and the future of the airframe industry hinges critically on these two companies.52.    Government policy towards the airframe industry was last consideredhy Ministers in December 1967 when it was agreed that, pending the reviewof the aircraft industry by the AI Ministerial Committee, no steps shouldbe taken to implement the policy announced in November 1966 for theGovernment to take a substantial minority shareholding in a singlecompany to be formed by a merger of the airframe interests of BAC andHawker Siddeley.    Publicly, the decision was linked to a need to re-examinepublic expenditure in the light of devaluation.   In announcing that theGovernment did not feel able for the time being to proceed with theirpreviously announced policy, the Minister of Technology stated that theGovernment still considered a merger of the two airframe groups to bedesirable.53.    The arguments for and against a merger can be considered underfour broad heads:-Rationalisation of resourcesFinancial StrengthManagementInternational considerations(a)   Rationalisation of ResourcesHSA and BAC possess at present between them seven design teams -four specialising in military aircraft and the remainder in civil air-craft.    By the mid-1970s there is on present forecasts likely to be enough work to support at most four teams:--25-

1 military combat aircraft team1 small (up to about -150 seats) sub-sonic civil aircraft team1 large (about 200 seats and over) sub-sonic- aircraft team1 supersonic transport team (this is at present engaged on concorde and can be expected to disappear in due course),although there will continue to be a considerable loadof design work to support the aircraft types already in service.Apart from differences in design capability (HSA, for example, havethe expertise on VTOL and BAC on.supersonics), there are a number of areas where the two groups have complementary technical capabilities which couldbe better employed if they were integrated under one management.    a unified management would also be in a better position to ensure that thereduction in design teams and the consequent redeployment of resourceswas achieved in the most efficient manner,.   For example, the big and expanding market is for sub-sonic civil aircraft and the United Kingdom&apos;sprospects of obtaining a substantial share of this market would be improved if the two existing civil sub-sonic teams (BAC Weybridge andHSA Hatfield) were under common management so that the industry couldformulate an overall strategy designed to make the maximum penetration in world markets instead of the present fragmented project approach which canresult in wasteful rivalry between the two teams and duplication of salesand marketing efforts.On the production side there is a theoretical case for substantialrationalisation; one of the causes of diseconomy in the present industrial structure is the fragmentation of production facilities(both within the main companies and between them) amongst a large numberof relatively small factories.   This has made it difficult to concentratedifferent aspects of the production process at a single location, and to effect, the economies which such concentration could achieve.   Thisrationalisation, however   would only be economic if the industry were to expand sufficiently to justify heavy investment in new plant and machinery.   Such an expansion, however, is not foreseen and it is doubtful-26-

whether, in the short or medium term, a unified management would add morethan marginally to suoh progress towards this end as the present companies are already making on their own.    But in the longer term,   since existingplant and facilities are constantly being replaced and since the physicalstructure of the industry may need re-working in the light of aircraftprogress in tho mid and late 1970s, a unified management would be in a stronger position to bring about the necessary rationalisation.(b) Financial StrengthA merger of the two groups would also improve the financial strengthof tho industry.   The amount a company can afford to invest in any oneprojoct is directly related to the company&apos;s net worth.   A merger wouldresult in an organisation with a net worth of approximately double thatof the two existing companies and as such enable it to make a greatercontribution to the cost of individual projects.    So long as tho companiesremain separate even projects of the size of tho BAC111 series and theTridont will stretch their resources.(c) ManagementTho achievement of the benefits discussed above would depend on thequality of the management of the new organisation and the vigour withwhich it pressed through tho necessary rationalisation measures.Rationalisation is a slow process but neither BAC nor HSA have boen parti-cularly impressive in the way they have tackled the job of reorganisationfollowing the mergers in 1959-    The quality of the existing management ofthe two groups is patchy.    Pressure would therefore need to be kept ontho management of a,merged organisation to ensure that it was sufficientlytough in cutting out duplication and drawing together resources of the two groups.    Otherwise, the result could be a large   flabby organisation whichwould be costly to maintain.   Much, of course, would depend on the manselected to be Chief Exocutive of the organisation.J-(d) Int ernational ConsiderationsOur hope has boon that the policy of collaboration v/ould in the longer term load to tho creation of a Luropoan airframo oompany or companios.A merger of BAC and HSA v/ould make tho situation le3s floxible.    It would create a large and powerful organisation which would dwarf any of theother airframe compenios on the Continent, and as such would bo likely to-27-

deter them from considering the possibility of close industrial ties withthe United Kingdom industry.    But there are no grounds for believing thatthe creation of a European airframe company is a practicable possibilityin the immediate future and we cannot be sure that it will ever come into being.    Apart from &apos;project companies&apos;  (such as SEPECAT for the Jaguar)and &apos;sales companies&apos;  (such as Bristol Siddeley Turbomeca International SA)there are no structural links between the main United Kingdom aircraftcompanies and their continental counterparts.   Within the continental countries, the only significant structural link is the one-sixth interest that Nord Aviation holds in Messerschmitt-Bolkow; on the other hand Pratt and17hitney   through   the United Aircraft Corporation has a 10 per cent holding in SNECMA, Boeings have a one-sixth holding in Messerschmitt-Bolkow,Northrop have a one-fifth holding in Fokker, and Lockheeds one-fifth inAermacchi.   It would be unwise to postpone steps to strengthen our own industry in the hope, which may not be fulfilled, of bringing about a european based company.5k-.   All these considerations go to confirm the judgment that in the longrun a merger of the two airframe groups would be in the national interest.However, the balance of considerations which led the Government inDecember 1967 to stop action to implement its earlier policy of directintervention (to bring about a merger with a substantial minorityshare-holding by the Government) still holds good.    If, however, circum-stances persuade the two companies themselves to propose a merger, thisshould be welcomed but neither company is likely to be in an effectiveposition to make a move while so much uncertainty hangs over major projects.   We consider the right course is for the Government to continueto use its influence in support of any measures which seem likely to helpbring a merger about.Guided Weapons55.   There are two main GW groups:   BAC(GW) and Ha-..ker Siddeley Dynamics.(Shorts is the other company making up the industry).   An early rationalisation -sation of these groups is desirable and the course to be adopted should follow that for the airframe industry.Aero-Engines56.   This industry apart from minor repair and overhaul facilities, is nowcomprised solely of Rolls Royce, which took over Bristol Siddeley in 1966of its own accord without any Government intervention to form the largest-28-CONFIDENTiAL

and most powerful engine group in Europe.    It has a strong commerciallyminded management and is competitive with the United States aero-engine industry.   In consequence, it has a greater variety of outletsthan the airframe industry through its ability to sell British engines forinstallation in foreign aircraft.   Internationally the aero-engine industryis intensely competitive and Rolls Royce are fighting hard to establish and maintain a market for their engines in American aircraft.    In common with the Companies in the airframe industry, the Company looks to theGovernment for a large proportion of its development funds but in termsof commercial and industrial strength completely overshadows the airframecompanies.   Rolls Royce are still reorganising following the acquisitionof Bristol Siddeley Ltd. and no action is called for at present&apos; by theGovernment in relation to the structure of the industry.Mr,q^ft^.Equipment&apos; and Components57.   Aircraft equipment and components are provided by some 300 suppliersof varying sizes, many of them quite small.   Pew of the companies whoregard themsleves as aircraft equipment specialists are wholly dependenton aircraft business and for many this forrrB only a proportion of their total output.   In many cases the suppliers are subsidiaries or divisionswithin general industrial companies.-29-CONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX FFuture United Kingdom Requirements and Forecast Production -Potential Exports1.     It is estimated that in the next decade the United Kingdom willspend, exclusive of R and D, over  4,000 million on aircraft comparedwith  3,300 million (at constant prices) during the last decade.Virtually all of this increase is accounted for hy rising demand onthe civil market.TABLE 1Last &quot;10 years Next 10 years1957-8 - 1966-7       1967-8 - 1976-7 million at end 1966 prices defence	2,600	2,625Civil	700	1,750	3,300	4,375United Kingdom Supply	3,050	2,750Purohases from United States	200	1,425Other overseas purchases	50	200	^;300	4,375Military R and D	1,200	575Civil R and B	450 h	825	1,670	1,4^0(h includes  310 million expenditure hy the companies(/      &quot;         325      &quot; &quot;     11 &quot;   &quot;        &quot;  &quot;Notes:       (1)   &quot;Other overseas purchases&quot; includes that portion of joint projects manufactured overseas hut going intoaircraft flown hy United Kingdom operators.(2)   Expenditure on any replacement for the cancelled F.111would he additional to the figures quated above.(3)   Much of the civil and (through export sales) some ofthe military R and D will be recovered in theproduction price.   To this extent the table contains an element of double counting.2.     Of the total United Kingdom requirement *f  4*375 million in theperiod I-967-68 - 1976-77 we are likely to meet 37 per cent( 1,625 &quot;million) from overseas.   Of this  1,425 million representspayment to the USA and  200 million payments to our foreign partners-37-CONFIDENTIAL

in joint projects (their payments to us are included in &quot;exports&quot; inTable 2 below).   Beyond that time, it can perhaps be assumed that united Kingdom requirements will continue at a rate of about ^00 million a year, of which it is reasonable to hope that if moresophisticated requirements can be mot through collaborative projectsa declining proportion will consist of direct imports.Export33.     The aircraft industry&apos;a exports are estimated as follows:TABLE 2Last 10 yoars Next 10 years1 &quot;9!?7-8 - 1966-7 1967-fl - 1 97^7 million at end 1966 pricesMilitary                                                        720 740Civil                                                             710 2,2001,430 2,940Notoa:      (1)   These figures include tho British-made proportionof joint projoots produced to moot requirementsof partners ovorseas.(2)   Tho figures shown for the nex-u docade are thosoregarded as realistic by the Ministry of Technology.The major companies have put forward significantlyhigher figures which the Ministry regard as over-optimistic, but not unreasonable as oommeroialobjootivo3.k.     In the last fe\v yoars thero has been a rapid increase in oxportsfrom just over  1C0 million a year in 1962-3 to more than  200 million a year in 1966 - 1968.   The recent substantial exports orders receivedreinforce tho Ministry of Technology&apos;s view that a level of :/,25Q- 350 :.a yoar can bo sustained in the futuro.-38-

ANNEX GAlternative Use of Resources...In. the Event, of cancellation of Major ProjegtaThe commitment of resources is well advanced in tho case of concorde but has hardly begun for Airbus or the Advanced Combat Aircraft.Even so, if Concorde continues it will, over the next decade, stillpre-empt resources on a larger scale than would the other two puttogether.   Tho main element involved is manpower, both that already employed within the industry and that which will require to bo recruitedas projects evolve.   This manpower contains a higher than averageproportion of high quality labour both in terms of manual skills and professional qualifications.   Those skills are of great importance in a wide range of technologies and are of a kind which could contributesignificantly to improved competitive performance in the engineering industry.2.     A decision taken within the next few months to cancel or not proceed with all three projocts would have the immediate consequenceof releasing some 14,000 workers, most of them at present employed on concorde.   Redundancy would occur primarily among those engaged onairframe work, but there would also be some redundancy in the aero-engine labour force.   Cancellation of all three projects would, unlessother projects were substituted, dispense with a peak annual demand for labour from 1973 to 1976 of some 56,000 within tho airframe and aero-engine sectors, plus a substantial number working for equipment firms.The ability of tho rest of the economy to absorb the manpower that wouldbe released - both by redundancy and non-rocruitment - followingcancellation depends in tho main upon three things;    first, the likolyemployment trends in the other industries in which men might takG upomployment;   secondly, the quality of the labour roleased (already described), and thirdly, the employment prospects in areas where the factories releasing the manpower are located.3.    The medium-term forecast for engineering output and productivitysuggests that there will need to be an overall expansion in employmentparticularly aftor 1969 and that the needs of tho mechanical engineeringsector^in particular will he expanding at the expense of other soctors.The aircraft industry is mainly sited outside Development Aroas andthere is no reason to boliove that tho majority of the skilled,semi-skilled and unskilled workers becoming redundant could not be readilyabsorbed in the engineering industries which are growing in these areas.-39-CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALA study of the redundancies following the cancellation of TSE2, HS 681and P1154   supports this view.   Assumptions about the absorption of professional engineers are more difficult to make.   In theory, theyshould not have too much difficulty in finding alternative employment.The aircraft industry employs only 2.3 per cent of the total presentUnited Kingdom stock.   Employers in the engineering industry forecast in 1965 a demand considerably above supply, and this is borne out bythe persistence of shortages in 1968.   Moreover, although the TSR2study showed that engineers found more difficulty in placing themselvesthan the rest, it also showed that three-quarters of them who tookanother job were in it within twelve weeks.   Nonetheless, this is thegroup which feels most strongly that its expertise is particular tothe aircraft industry, that may be looking for higher salaries, andthat may need to move to other areas to find the kind of employment itregards as suitable.   This may mean that some of them will join aircraftcompanies overseas.4.     The capital facilities already in existence (primarily, in this context, for Concorde) are not in general readily transferable.   Anywind tunnels, structural test facilities, simulators, and much of the specialised production machinery no longer needed by the industry couldnot be applied in other fields.   The buildings, normally too tall for ordinary manufacturing purposes and involving high heating and maintenancecosts, would require extensive adaptation.   However if it were decidedfor other reasons that the use of these capital assets for productionof aircraft was no longer economic it follows that any wastage arisingfrom their disposal must be accepted.5.     The ti-ansfer of manpower into other engineering industries would,of course, expand the capacity of these industries.   If this additional capacity was devoted to production for domestic and export consumption in the proportions which are forecast for the engineering and alliedindustries in 1972 the positive impact on the balance of trade would beabout 20 per cent of the additional gross output excluding duplication(that is exports 30 per cent, less imports generated by the rise in output 10 per cent).   There are grounds for assuming that the positiveeffect would be higher than this since resources released would tend tobe absorbed in the expanding exporting sectors which may be experiencinglabour shortages after the end of 1969.   In the recent past (196O-67)exports of the aircraft industry have comprised about 25 per cent of grossoutput and because activity in the industry does not appear to generatea substantial level of imports the positive impact on the balance of trade has probably been not less than 20 per cent of gross output.   The industryexpects this proportion to increase over the next few years,CONFIDENTIAL   -A.0-

6.     In general, therefore, there is probably little to choose botwoonthe aircraft industry and other sectors of tho engineering industry interms of balance of payments benefit for a given level of output.   Butthe aircraft industry, in producing under 9 per cent of tho engineeringdoctor&apos;s output, consumes nearly 50 per oont of its total R and Dexpenditure and employs 13.5 per cent of its qualified scientists and engineers.   II; can bo argued therefore that for a given output and balance of payments benefit tho aircraft industry is more demanding thantho rest of tho engineering industry in its use of scarce resources andthat some transfer of those resources out of aircraft work would havebeneficial consoquencos for tho economy.   Such a transfer would alsomovo rosources out of projects which have a high risk element, and requireGovernment support, into areas where normal commercial risks prevailand where economic returns aro more certain.7.     On tho other hand, this redeployment would, undoubtedly tales time;some resources of skilled manpower, and fixed assets, might well, astho previous paragraphs show, bo lost to United Kingdom productionaltogether, and thero is no guarantee that redeployment would resultin the production, on a comparable scale, of goods contributing to thebalance of payments.   Whilst it is impossibls to quantify, there might be some short-term loss of foreign earnings.-41 -CONFJDENTIAL

ANNEX HConsequences of Abandonment of Conoorde, a aodiuxi cir^oraftand Advanood 1&apos;ilitary Capability1.   The Concorde is the most advanced civil aircraft project in being in the world, and it is the largest industrial investment this country has over made.   It is the one major advance technological project in whichEuropean applied technology i3 demonstrably ahead of the American.   Thoproject currently accounts for about 13,000 jobs in the United Kingdom.About 6,500 are with BAC (out of that Companyls total payroll of 30,000on aircraft work), 3,500 with the Bristol Engine Division of Holla Royce(out of a total payroll for tho Rolls Royce Group of 73,000) and about,000 with equipment firms.     Geographically, tho heaviest concentration(7,800)is in Bristol (4,300 out of the 7,300 BAC employees there and3,500 out of the 14,500 Bristol Engine Division employees).   As the product!of Concorde gets into full swing, -these numbers will increase steadily toreach a peak of about 30,000   in the early 70&apos;a in the two main firmswith many thousands more in equipment firms.2.   The British share in the development and production of tho Concordeairframe is being undertaken by BAC Exiton, with a small part of thowork detached to Weyhridge.   The Concorde is Pilton&apos;s only major project and, if it were to be canoelled, BAC would almost certainly cloze downFilton and concentrate the remaining work on their Woybridgo factory.The engine for Concorde, the Olympus 593, i3 being developed at Patchway,Bristol.   Work on the Pegasus engine and a number of more minor projectscould keep the Patchway development team alive, but the cancellation of thoOlympus 593 would reduce the unit appreciably in size, importance andtechnical ability.   There should be scope for transferring some productionwork to Bristol from the Derby and satellite plants of Rolls Royce overthe next few years, but the cancellation of the Olympus 593 would certainlygive rise to an immediate loss of jobs In excess of 3,000.&apos;!).   In addition to the airframe and the engine, 3,000 workers aro currontlyinvolved on the development and manufacture of equipment for the Concordein tho United Kingdom.   In all, over 40 major firms in this country,including&quot;Elliots, had, Porranti, Ultra and the Dowty Group, aro involvodto a greater or lesser extent.   The wide geographical spread of thisemployment is shown in the map at Appendix A.-42-

4,    Work on the design of medium aircraft is being undertaken as aprivate venture by both HSA and BAC.   In December 1968 the Sud Aviation-ledconsortium, of which HSA are members, withdrew the A.300 design and submitted a fresh proposal for an aircraft of about 250 seat capacity,based on the RB 211 engine, in place of the RB 207 which has now been cancelled for this application.   HSA&apos;s current work, at their own expense, is concentrated entirely in their Hatfield factory.   Theamount of employment, if the project goes ahead into development and production, has not been forecast, but on previous plans it would have risen to about 15,000 in 1973.   Manufacture would be mainly at Hatfieldbut other factories such as Brough, ITamble and Chester, which may befacing shortages of work in that period, would probably participateBACs proposals for the BAC 311, which also feature the RB 211 engine,have not yet been submitted and it is not possible to forecast how work would be distributed, either internationally or within the United Kingdom.It is possible that HSA could participate as sub-contractors.5.    Current employment on an advanced military aircraft is still smalland restricted to preliminary design work, at BAC Warton and at rolls royce, Patchway.   Depending on the eventual Unitod Kingdom share of thetotal project package, it could reach a peak of approaching 20,000in the mid-1970s.   Without an advanced combat aircraft, the designteam at Warton would quickly break up and with it the Unitod Kingdom&apos;scapability of producing advanced combat aircraft.The, viability of tho industry.    Abandonment of the advanced combat aircraft project would in tho viewof the Ministry of Technology have the most serious effects on the longterm viability of the industry.   In the shorter term, cancellation ofthe Concorde would also in the Ministry&apos;s opinion have serious implicationsand would reduce the range of aircraft which could be produced in theUnited Kingdom.   Tho effect on the technical capability of tho industry would be softened if the advanced combat aircraft went ahead unless, as could well hapjpen, the psychological effect of a further majorcancellation was so great that the key design porsonnel lost confidence in the future and left the industry.   A docision not to proceed with a medium aircraft, as on international project, might affect othercollaboration in Europe.   But the viability of the industry would notnecessarily be affected.   It would still be open to us to develop,unilaterally or in association with the Americans if they were so willing,passenger aircraft of up to 200-300 seats.-43-CONFIDENTIAL

7,   Tho problems would, of course, be very much worse if two or moreprojects were cancelled.   If, for example, both Concorde and the advanced combat aircraft, which are both BAC projects were abandoned thiswould to all, intents and purposes leave the Company in the long run with only one remaining unit at Weybridge.   It is doubtful whether the Companycould survive as a viable commercial entity in these circumstances.Any combination including the abandonment of advanced military aircraft would also make it impossible to maintain in the longer term an advancodindustry in this country.8.   The industry&apos;s programme (including Concorde, ^Q nedium aircraft,and the advanced combat aircraft) shows in any case a substantial decrease inIt and D activity in the 1970s with a corresponding reduction in thenumbers of design staff.    A reduction is expected in the number of design teams in the two main airframe companies to probably four - onemilitary combat aircraft team, one subsonic civil team, one supersoniccivil team and the equivalent of one further team on miscellaneous work.The design base is therefore contracting sharply.     The cancellation ofany of these major projects would, unless new projects were developed toreplace them, reduce the design base even further.9.   Despite United States dominance of the world market (see paragraph 21of the main paper), it might he possible for the aircraft industry toretain profitable business by producing 3mall aircraft and by doing sub-contract work, without any significant advanced design capability.     Butit must be emphasised that the big prospects in the civil aviation world market are the bigger aircraft.     The wwrld market for civil aircraft which will be in service by 1985 is estimated to be worth in the region of  45.,000 million.     By 1985, short/medium-haul traffic is expected tohave grown to over four times its present level, all carried by aircraftnot yet in service and in some cases not yet even in the early projectstage.     It is impossible therefore at this stage to be at all preciseabout the requirements for different individual categories of aircraftbut the ch rt at Appendix B shows two possible alternative means of-44-

meeting the demand..     Either way, it is quite clear that if for whateverreasons we fail to build or participate in the building of new airoraftwith capacities greater than 150 seat3 we restrict ourselves to oompotingfor at the most some 25 per cent by value of the world market for commercial transport aircraft - and considerably le3s than thi3 if thopresent conoept3 of inter-oity VTOL airoraft do not come to fruition.This oomparos with the chances of competing for some 60 per cent of the 45,000 million demand if we are concex-ned with the development of aircraft of 200+ seats and exclude ourselves only from the long rangemarket.     If the United Kingdom industry is restricted to buildingaircraft of less than 200 seats, the potential aeronautical exports of 200- 3O0 million per annum aro likely to be reduced by at least a half,and the import bill much increased.10.   It should also be remembered that all three projects underconsideration are European.     The cancellation (or failure to go ahead)of each of them other than in agreement with our partners would be boundto have reperoussions upon our future ability to persuade european governments and aircraft industries to collaborate with us in futureprojects.     Apart from the purely aircraft industry aspects there are inaddition implications for our general reputation as a reliable partnerand for our ability to conduct any kind of programme cf Europeanoo-operation.11.   The difficulty is that the future of the industry and of the majorunits in it is largely tied to the success of a small number of verylarge projects and a decision on each particular project has an effect onthe total capability of the industry.     Our- future ability to takeadvantage of the growing world market for aeronautical products, tho lossof effective industrial units and the consequences to our general Europeanpolicy all have to be taken into account.     These wider problems come intothe discussion of each of tho individual projects which makes it difficult for them, to be considered in isolation from one another.-2,-5-

ANNEX JThe Meaning of &quot;Advanced Design&quot; in Military Aviation1.    In the past the development of military aircraft has in general beendominated by advances in speed.     Advances were of course also made in other factors affecting military effectiveness such as range, payload, manoeuvra-bility, rate of climb, navigation and bombing accuracy etc.     But there is nodoubt, that it was the increase in speed, from for example the 200 m.p.h. of pre-war fighters to the 1,500 m.p.h. of corresponding present day aircraft which represented the most spectacular element in the progress made in thepast.2,    This emphasis on speed seems unlikely to continue in the future.     Thenext generation of military aircraft will not be capable of speeds substan-tially higher than those which have now been commonplace for more than adecade.     The ERCA in particular will have a maximum speed no higher (it maybe lower) than its predecessors (FIOA and Lightning).     It is impossible tobe certain what will happen in succeeding generations but there is at present no evidence of strong military pressure towards further large increases inspeed,3.    The reason for this is that speeds have already become so high that further increases are of doubtful military value.     The emphasis has shiftedto other characteristics, particularly to airfield performance, manoeuvra-bility, low altitude capability, reliability, all-weather capability,navigation and bombing accuracy, range, payload, and, above all, to the attainment of these characteristics in aircraft of minimum size and cost.Requirements for future fighter strike aircraft at present under discussion,for example, call for a combination of range, payload, manoeuvrability andairfield performance in ndvanco of anything achieved hitherto, withinthe defined weight and cost limits-&apos;, but not for an increase in speed.4.    Thus although the possibility of further increases in the speed ofcertain military aircraft (i.e. to above Mach 3 and eventually even higherhypersonic speeds) cannot be ruled out, there is no doubt that the emphasisin future military requirements as at present envisaged is overwhelminglyon the other characteristics mentioned and &quot;advanced military design&quot; in thefuture will be concerned primarily with Improvements in these characteristics.-46-

5.     In the case of airframe, future military desgn effort will thereforebe concerned with reducing drag in all conditions of flight (subsonic aswell as supersonic) in order to achieve the best possible payload/rangecharacteristics for minimum size and cost:   improving lift and lift/dragratio (for take-off and landing);   reducing structure weight, whilst retain-ing the requisite strength and &quot;life&quot;;   developing materials of improvedstrength at lower weight;   improving the flying qualities;   and in general with finding the best compromises between the many conflicting factors which affect the capability of the aircraft (e.g, the compromise between the conflicting design features needed for high and low speeds).6.     In the case of the equipment, advanced military design effort vdll befocused on improving reliability and effectiveness and reducing weight andvolume.     The reliability targets which are being set in the military requirements now under discussion in the USA and in Europe will presentdesigners with a strong challenge, as will the navigational accuracy, all-weather performance, and the miniaturisation features being called for.7.     In the case of the engine, the improvement which will be needed for future military aircraft, as for the airframe, will be those which will leadto gains in range, payload, and airfield performance (i.e. specific fuelconsumption and thrust/weight ratio) rather than to increased speed.     Manydevelopments will take place in the effort to achieve these improvements,but the most important will undoubtedly be the increase in turbine temperaturewhich will be achieved in the next generation of military engines, but whichwill demand a great step forward in turbine technology.8.    Eor these reasons, the fall-out from military development into civil aircraft technology in the future vdll be as great as in the past, and will apply across the board to all types of civil aircraft for which high efficiencyis demanded (i.e. for all types where the competition is strong).     Thus itwill apply not only to the large aircraft like the Airbus types, but also to small feeder line jets (for which there is an estimated market in the western world of&quot; vrall over 1,000 by 1980).     Indeed the problem of achieving thenecessary level of economy of operation in these small jets is more severe-2,7-

than it is for the larger aircraft, so that greater demands are nade onachieving the highest aerodynamic, structural and propulsion efficiencywhilst the need to operate from minor airfields with limited resourcesplaces a higher premium on reliability and on self-contained navigationsystems.9.    These arguments apply also to production.    Wo advances in aerodynamic,materials, or structural design can be exploited unless they be put intoeconomic production.     In many cases indeed the real design problem is how to exploit a new idea without an increase in production costs.     Theintroduction of new materials is a good example.     The further exploitation of titanium, and even of some of the fibre reinforced materials, is nowmainly a question of development of production technology in these materials-48-
