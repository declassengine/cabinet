confidential DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)6 VC169133COPY NO,CABINETN^PLAli^J-PiiXOIlSAJ^ARJESMemorandum by the First Secretary of State andthe Lord Privy seal the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) Iwivesubmitted to us their Report on Top Salaries in the private sector and nationalised Industries and it will be published on Tuesday,25th March, 1969.2.      The Report is concerned with two main issues :-(i)    The application of the White Paper on Productivity,Prices and Incomes Policy in 1968 and 1969(Cmnd 35 90) to remuneration at the highest levels in the private sector and nationalised industries; and(ii)   the appropriate range of remuneration at seniormanagerial and Board levels in nationalised industries.THE BOARDS CONCLUSIONSTop Salaries Generally3,     The Board&apos;s enquiries suggest that in the three years betweenSeptember, 1965 and September 1968 top salaries increased as follows;NationalisedIndustriesPrivate SectorMainBoardMembers-r 2. 0%4- 8. 0%OtherSeniorExecutives+ 10. 0%+ 15. 0%All Emp-loyees inthe under-takings+ 16% )+ 19% )all workers(1964/67)-f 18%Pay increases for top executives have been less than those given on average to all workers in both their own companies and indeed in the economy as a whole.    The Board conclude that, in general, a measureof restraint has been shown in movements in top salaries in the past three years.-1-TOXM30IdMQ0

4.      The Board say, however, that many companies are inclined atpresent to over-emphasise the importance of comparisons with salaries in other companies when determining pay, with self-defeating results.The Board consider that &quot;what is required is the establishment of salary structures which aim primarily   to induce internally theassumption of greater responsibility and .......... to rewardperformance, and which only in the second instance look at what is happening outside&quot;.5.      The Board refer to the question of changes in the pay of singleindividuals.    They say that judgments about their justification in termsof incomes policy would be difficult because such judgments would imply questioning employers1 judgments about the performance of individuals.    The Board consider, therefore, that &quot;The pay of an individual can be properly judged only in relation to the entire salary structure of which it is a part; it is the salary structure of firms which therefore require consideration and, if need be, reference tothis Board&quot;.Top Salaries in Nationalised Industries6.      The Boardls recommendations on top salaries in the nationalised industries flow from these principles.     They argue that a sound salary structure is required which will permit the granting of adequate rewardsfor individual performance and the assumption of greater responsibilitiesthat at present there is &quot;insufficient headroom&quot; below Board level to achieve such a structure;  and that there should be substantial increases in salaries of Board members in order to enable revisions of salary structure to be made.7.      The Board do not regard complete   equivalence with private industry as necessary, and indeed suggest that it could prove self-defeating.    However, higher salaries than the present ones are needed to make it possible to recruit top management from outside.8.     Details of the new salaries recommended for Board members aregiven at Annex A.     The Chairmen of the main Boards would get 20, 000 instead of  12,500 with increases of a similar order for others.The Board suggest that the increases should be phased over the next three years.Top salaries in the Private Sector9.      This reference arose in part from the feeling that the incomes policy did not bite on top executives and that unreasonable increases in pay were being given to them.    As far as it goes, the Board&apos;s report is helpful since it shows that there has been no general run-away in top salaries; and indeed that on average they have over the last three yearsrisen less than the pay of ordinary wage and salary earners.-2-&quot;IVIlNaQUNOO

10.     Of course this still leaves open the possibility of large increases in pay for certain individuals which could not be justified under the incomes policy.    The Board face up to this in their Report and saythat the appropriate pay for individuals can only be profitably considered in relation to the salary structure in the firm concerned.     If therefore we want the Board to look at the absolute level of top salaries (which isincidentally something the CBI would object to in the strongest terms),we should have to refer to them the whole salary structure of an individual firm - including pay of Board members.    It may well be thatwe ought to consider such a reference in a suitable case.Salaries of Boards of Nationalised Industries11,     We must also decide whether to accept and implement the Board&apos;srecommendations on salaries of Chairmen and Members of Boards ofthe Nationalised Industries.    Many of us have thought for a long time that we must face up to this.    But the increases proposed are of coursevery large both in absolute and percentage terms.    And it may bethought that it would be awkward to make them when we are trying to operate a pretty tough incomes policy.12.     The Board themselves argue that the increases are justifiedunder the current White Paper provided they are introduced by stages.The Board regard the changes as:-&quot;a major reorganisation of wage and salary structureswhich can be justified on productivity and efficiency grounds&quot;.which is a ground for an exceptional increase under the White Paper,13.     The first instalment is about 15 per cent (taking Chairmen,Deputy Chairmen and Members together), and since they have had noincreases since 1964, this is within the effective ceiling of 17\ per cent.The timing of the second and third instalments could ba looked at again in the light of incomes policy after 1969.14.     It is also relevant to remember how small is the increase in actual pay after tax which is involved.     The Board make the point intheir Report.    Even an increase from  12,5 00 to  20,000 may wellmean an increase in net pay of little more than  1, 000 a year.15.     However, it would be idle to pretend that the implementation ofthese increases will not be described in certain sectors of the Party andthe Trade Union movement as evidence that the incomes policy is onlyapplied to organised wage and salary earners.lf*.     We need also to consider the repercussions of the increases.The NBPI has specifically indicated the need for a revision of salarystructures below Board level in the nationalised industries.    Theyconsider this is a management decision althoixgh they suggest that thenumber of people concerned will not be large (they regard &quot;compression&quot;as operating mainly at salaries from  6,000 a year upwards).    It is-3-&quot;1VS1N3QIJNOD

proposed that the Ministers responsible should make early contact withChairmen of nationalised industries to ensure that increases amongsenior executives are co-ordinated and consistent with incomes policy.17.     Outside the nationalised industries, the main repercussions of acceptance of the Boardls recommendations will be on relatively small numbers of senior civil servants (the Plowden Committee has deferreda report on pay in the higher civil service pending publication of the nbpi report), and perhaps the higher judiciary; it might also add to the pressure for a review of ministers and MPs&apos; salaries.    There will be other public service groups, such as university teachers, who will point to what they will regard as inequities between these recommendations and their own last review.18.     When the Report is published on 25th March, we shall have tomake a statement of our position.    The courses open to us are to accept and implement the recommendations; to say that implementation willhave to be postponed for a time;   or to say that we are studying thereport and will make a decision later.19.     The last course is not attractive.    The publication of the report will attract widespread publicity and comment: a decision in a month or two&apos;s time to accept the recommendation would lead to a further round of discussion and criticism.    If we are going to go ahead we might aswell say so now.20,     On balance, our recommendation is to accept and implement theBoardrs Report,    We must accept the NBPI&apos;s firm conclusion that pay of Board memberr. needs to be raised if we are to continue to haveefficient management of the nationalised sector.     The only questiontherefore is timing.    The time is never &quot;ripe&quot; for major changes ofthis kind; and the board&apos;s Report gives us as good an occasion as weshall ever have,21,     We have considered whether the public impact and thepossibility of repercussions could be lessened by accepting only thefirst instalment and leaving decisions on the final salaries till later.On the whole, we think that this would give us the worstiof both worlds;we should be attacked from all sides, and would not establish a soundsalary structure in the nationalised industries.     We could howeverreserve our position on possible deferments of the operative dates forthe later instalments in the light of incomes policy after 1969.CpJiCJLJJSIO^22.     We invite our colleagues to consider whether or not to acceptthe board Report.    If it is decided to accept it, a satement along the lines of the draft at Annex B might be made in the House.B, A.

G-roup B comprises BOAC and BEA,the Central Electricity Generating Board, the London Transport Board, thenational Freight Corporation and the National Bus Company.     The Boardrecommend that full-time Board Members should be paid on personal ranges between 8,000 and  15,000, their point on the range to depend on their performance inthe job and only to go above the mid-point if their performance is outstandingaThey would receive a flat 10 per cent increase from 1.4.69 and variable amounts in the two following years.     For a member of a G-roup A Board now on the topsalary of  9,500 this might mean an increase in three annual instalments to 12,500.     Increases are also recommended for certain minor boards.     In the transitional period, the Board consider that, in the case of a new appointment,the Government should be free to go up to the new recommended pay levelimmediately.     The NBPI say that the British Steel Corporation is not coveredby their immediate recommendations, since salaries have only recently been setfor the Corporation.     The salaries there are generally above the figuresrecommended for other major Boards.     This leaves us with the problem of the salary of. Lord Melchett which is below that of his Deputy Chairman.The Board also makes recommendations for more flexible pension arrange-merits at the top level in the nationalised industries.lVIJLNaCNdNOOSALARIES OF CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF BOARDS OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES

NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AMD INCOffflS\ REPORT ON TOP SALARIESDRAFT CrOVmMBMT ANNOUNCEMENT1,    The Report of the National Board for Prices and Incomes on top salaries in the private sector and nationalised industries is published today.2.    The Report reviews the application of incomes policy to top remuneration and concludes that a &quot;measure of restraint has been exercised&quot;.     The Boardhowever say that they cannot say whether the policy has been strictly adhered to;   and suggest that my Department should consider whether at the highestlevels the principles set out in the Report are being followed.     I shallaccordingly be considering whether any references of the salary structure of firms should be made.3.    The Board also make recommendations for increases in the salaries ofChairmen and members of the Boards of Nationalised Industries.     The board are not inclined to regard comparability with outside industry as the maincriterion for deciding the level of salaries but stress the need for salarystructures which can give adequate rewards for individual performance andthe assumption of greater responsibilities.     The levels of pay suggestedfall below the average of salaries paid in the private sector but are, inthe Board&apos;s view, sufficient to ensure an adequate supply of able seniormanagers.4.    The salaries in question are unchanged since 1964;   and provided thatthey are staged in three instalments the increases recommended are, in theBoard&apos;s view, justified under the prices and incomes policy.     Accordingly,the Government accept the recommendations on salary levels;   other detailed recommendations will require study and consultation with the Chairmen of the boards concerned.
