DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69X.44 COPY NO._____2nd Max, JJ?69CABINETRHODESIA; EXCHANGES WITH THE REGIMEMeilic^ran^^The full text of a memorandum from the regime, dated16th April, was received in London on 24th April.    This memorandum(attached at Annex A) was in reply to a British memorandum, dated11th March, which maintained at all points the positions taken up by her Majesty&apos;s Government (HMG) at the end of the &quot;Fearless&quot; andSalisbury talks.?..     This latest Rhodesian memorandum makes no attempt to bridge the gap between them and us.    It is clearly intended for eventualpublication with a view to throwing on HMG responsibility for failure toreach a settlement.3.     It is important that we should reply as soon as possible, sincethe regime are shortly proposing to publish the terms of the RhodesiaFront constitutional proposals, which will then (failing some unexpecteddevelopment) form the basis of a referendum dae to be held a few weekslater.    We shall need to be able to rebut accusations by the regime thatwe have ignored their &quot;proposals&quot;.    A draft reply was considered by asmall group of Ministers under the Prime Ministers chairmanship on30th April and I now circulate this (at Annex B) for approval by theCabinet.4.      There is no expectation that our current exchanges with the regime will lead to a settlement.    All our information suggests that the regime have given up hope of this and are determined to press ahead with their proposals for a republican Rhodesia under a racialistconstitution.    However, it is important that when our exchanges withthe regime are published, they should convince public opinion in thiscountry and elsewhere that we have made every reasonable effort tocome to ah agreement and that this has not been frustrated because ofa rigid insistence by HMG on requirements that could be represented asbeing incompatible with the Rhode sian sovereignty which a settlement on&quot;Fearless&quot; lines would establish.-1

5.     The proposed reply has been drafted with these considerations in mind.    It adheres strictly to the line taken by HMG in the &quot;Fearless&quot;and Salisbury discussions, except in regard to one question concerningthe &quot;second safeguard&quot;, which is the central - but by no means the only -point of difference between the two sides.    That question relates to the role allotted to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in tie&quot;referendum&quot; version of the second safeguard put forward by the minister without Portfolio in Salisbury last November.    Their role was not to beto decide whether a proposed constitutional amendment should be permitted, nor to initiate the referendum process; but simply to decide whether an amendment on which a referendum had been requested by theappropriate Rhodesian body was in fact of such a nature as to warrant a referendum.    The draft reply states that, if the regime see difficultyin a safeguard containing an external element (i. e. the role mentionedabove for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council), &quot;the BritishGovernment are ready to consider a purely internal Rhodesian safeguardso long as it provides an equally effective guarantee of the SecondPrinciple&quot;.    It goes on to provide two examples of an internal safeguardthat might be acceptable to us.    I see no likelihood at all of the regime&apos;saccepting either of these proposals.    The first one, namely the dropping of the Privy Council&apos;s &quot;sieving&quot; role, would have the effect that an^amendment of an entrenched constitutional provision would have to go toa referendum, instead of only those for which a referendum had been requested and which were held by the Privy Council to require this procedure.    When the referendum form of the second safeguard was discussed in Salisbury last November,, Mr. Smith objectad to the wholebasis of the proposal, i. 3. that it involved consulting the people and notmerely his Parliament.    He did not in fact comment on the limited&quot;sieving&quot; role that the Privy Council would play in it.    As to the secondexample, this proposal was rejected as unacceptable by the regime&apos;sspokesman during the &quot;Fearless&quot; talks, and they have never responded to this or the other suggestions made by the Prime Minister to theHouse of Commons on 22nd October.6.     The draft reply also appeals to the regime &quot;to put forward theirown proposals for a safeguard that would effectively guarantee the SixPrinciples&quot;,     The regime have hitherto maintained that no &quot;secondsafeguard&quot; is necessary and they are unlikely to respond to this appeal.If they did, I should expect little difficulty in demonstrating that whateverthey proposed fell short of what is required to guarantee our principles.7.     The Prime Minister has already indicated in Parliament, inreply to questions by the Leader of the Opposition (Hansard for18th February, Col, 205, and 4th March, Col. 212), that we do not exclude the possibility of a purely internal second safeguard.    For thereasons given earlier in this Note I believe it would be of considerablepresentational value to confirm this in a written communication to the regime.    I should therefore be grateful for my colleagues&apos; concurrence in a reply on the lines of the attached draft.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S.W. 1.2nd May, 1969

ANNEX AReferences 43/217/35DEPARTMENT OP THE PRIME MINISTER,Private Bag 700, CAUSEWAY,SALISBURY.16th April, 1969Dear Mr. Carter,Thank you for your letters of the 11th and 18th March,1969, enclosing a Memorandum from your Government,I am now instructed by my Prime Minister to enclosefor transmission to the British Government for their consideration a Memorandum in reply to their own.Your sincerely,(J. P. MARSHALL)P. A. Carter, Esq.,Head of the British Residual Mission,Salisbury.

memorandum the Rhodesia Government have considered the Memorandumdated the 11th March, 19 69.    They note with scepticism thestatement that the British Government are &quot;still concerned to achieve an honourable settlement&quot; in view of the uncompromisingattitude adopted by the British Government in their Memorandum.The British Government appear not to acknowledge the slightestmerit in any of the proposals or arguments of the rhodesia government, despite the fact that they represented a sincereand constructive attempt to bridge the gap between the twoGovernments.As proof of this attitude it is only necessary to refer to the rejection by the British Government of the Rhodesianproposal relating to cross-voting and the extension of the &quot;B&quot;Roll and their summary dismissal of the incontrovertible casepresented by the Rhodesia Government for not accepting asystem of appeals in ordinary cases to the Judicial Committeeof the Privy Council.2.     The reply by the British Government gives every indication that the significance of the Rhodesian proposals has not beenappreciated.    Indeed, in view of some of the patent errorscontained in the British Memorandum, even after it was correctedby a subsequent communication on the 18th March, 1969, it is apparent that the Rhodesian proposals have not been givenserious consideration.    For example, the observation is madein paragraph 4 of the British Memorandum that &quot;it may be truethat it would not always be an entirely simple matter to achieve a majority o:f three-quarters&quot;.   This statement mis-represents the position because the proposed composition ofthe Legislature ensures that it would never be a simple matter to achieve a three-quarters majority.   And again in paragraph 7of the Memorandum the statement that &quot;the right of electionfor those holding extended qualifications is limited to15 &quot;B&quot; Roll seats is palpably inaccurate.    The proposalsprovide for 17 &quot;B&quot; Roll seats and 8 elected African Senatorseats for which Africans holding extended qualifications wouldhave a right to vote.3.     Moreover, it is obvious that the British Governmentare no//insisting on conditions which are not even requiredby their own six principles.    As each issue was canvassedduring Mr.  Thomson&apos;s visit to Salisbury in November, 1968 it became apparent that he was introducing conditions nevercontemplated previously.   Prior to his visit there was onlyone major-issue, which the British Government apparentlyregarded as non-negotiable, to be settled.    At that stage the rhodesia Government were confident that real progress had beenmade towards a settlement.    This confidence was dispelledduring the course of that visit with the proliferation of points of difference which the British delegation raised to major non-negotiable issues,/The

The British Government1s stand on their proposals on the franchise, cross-voting and the &quot;overriding objective&quot; formulaexemplify this point.    Furthermore, these proposals go beyond what is required under the British first principle becausethey provide for an acceleration of African political progress,not envisaged under the 1961 Constitution.    In terms of this principle, unimpeded progress has to be maintained and guaranteed- the principle imposes no obligation to provide for a greaterrate of progress than that already envisaged.    The rhodesia government have met the British first principle by making proposals which would maintain and guarantee the rate of african political advancement provided under the 1961 Constitution.A similar position obtains with regard to the Britishthird principle which requires that there would have to be animmediate improvement in the political status of the Africanpopulation.    The composition of the Legislature and the franchiseproposed by the Rhodesia Government would in fact bring about an immediate and very considerable improvement in the politicalstatus of Africans and would more than satisfy the Britishthird principle, but yet again the British Government claim that these proposals fall short of their requirements.The British Government&apos;s insistence that former Rhodesianpublic servants who defected should be reinstated is anotherexample of a condition which has been given exaggerated importance and which not only falls outside the requirements of statedBritish principles hut is in fact not relevant to theConstitution in any way.4.     In respect of the &quot;blocking quarter&quot;in the Legislature thechange in the British attitude is also very apparent.    Priorto Mr. Thomson&apos;s visit in November, it had always been understood by the Rhodesia Government that while the British Governmentrequired a blocking quarter, the detailed composition of theLegislature was a matter for negotiation.   That this was theBritish Government&apos;s requirement at that time is evidenced bythe Fearless document itself which states under item (2) ofPart I -&quot;The British Government are prepared to considervariations in the composition of the Legislature, includingincreased chiefly representation, provided that itsecures at all times a &quot;blocking quarter&quot; of directly and popularly elected Africans&quot;.Unequivocal definitions of &quot;blocking quarter&quot; have been givenby Mr. Wilson and Mr. Thomson in the House of Commons fromtime to time.    On the 22nd October, 1968 Mr. Wilson said -&quot;By a &apos;blocking quarter&apos; I mean a figure which,when the total representation is divided by four, gives a clear blocking mechanism to directly elected Africanswho have been elected by Africans&quot;./Earlier

Earlier on the 14th March, 1968 Mr. Wilson said -&quot;He (referring to Sir Alec Douglas Home) will recall that I said to hinTthat if Mr. Smith is prepared toaccept a &quot;blocking quarter&quot; why not let us have a figure which is a quarter of the total?&quot;And on the 17th June, 1968 Mr. Thomson said -&quot;The great advantage of the &quot;blocking quarter&quot; isthat it is&quot;not really a matter of political judgment....... about which the British Government might disagreewith Mr. Smith.    The &quot;blocking quarter&quot; is a quarter;it is a matter of arithmetic, not politics ......11.The Rhodesia Government agree with Mr. Thomson -that a &quot;blockingquarter&quot; is not really a matter about which there can bedisagreement and that it is merely a matter of arithmetic.Notwithstanding these previous unambiguous statements,in November Mr. Thomson when faced with Rhodesian proposalswhich secured a &quot;blocking quarter&quot; said that he was onlyprepared to consider alternative proposals as to the composition of the Legislature if they did not reduce the blocking mechanismbelow that proposed on Fearless (which is more than a &quot;blockingquarter&quot;) and also provided that there was no increase in the&quot;A&quot; Roll seats.    The Rhodesian delegation was surprised at theintroduction of these new conditions but even so, the latestRhodesian proposal as to the composition of the Legislaturefalls entirely within the new limits set by Mr. Thomson.Again the Rhodesian proposals have been rejected by the BritishGovernment.5.     In their Memorandum the British Government state thatthey &quot;have kept the Fearless proposals (as modified as a resultof the talks in Salisbury) on the table in the hope thatMr. Smith and his colleagues would either decide to accept these proposals or else make alternative suggestions of theirown which may form the basis of a satisfactory settlement&quot;.The Rhodesian Government feel constrained to point out thatall the alternative suggestions which they have made have met with a negative response from the British Government who have continued rigidly to adhere to their own terms for a settlement.It seems clear that the fullest extent to which the BritishGovernment are prepared to search for a settlement is to leavethe Fearless proposals &quot;on the table&quot; and they are unwilling to enter into negotiations on them in the real sense of thatterra.   If this appraisal of the British Governments attitude is correct, it shows their complete indifference to a settlement.6.     The Rhodesian Government have been prepared to makeconsiderable concessions because they believe that a settlement is in the interests of Rhodesia and Great Britain but thereare limits beyond which they cannot go.    It now seems clearthat the intransigent attitude of the British Government stands in the way of any agreement being reached.    The rhodesia government are committed to holding a referendum very soon on/the

the constitutional future of Rhodesia.    As was explained whenthe Referendum Bill was published, should agreement be reached between the Rhodesia and British Governments, the referendumwould be based on the agreed proposals, but in the absence ofagreement the referendum would be on the Rhodesia Government&apos;constitutional proposals.   Unless there is a change in theattitude of the British Government the Rhodesia Government willhave no option but to proceed with the referendum on their own proposals which will be outlined shortly in an appropriateWhite Paper.

ANNEX draft -REPLY FROM HMG TO THE REGIMEHer Majesty1 s- Government in the United Kingdom have given careful consideration to the Rhodesian Memorandum of 16 April.They note with regret that it contains no constructive proposals.Its purpose appears to be to suggest that substantial concessionshave been made on the Rhodesian side, that the Rhodesianmemorandum of 13 February represented a sincere attempt to bridge the gap between the two parties, and that it is Britishintransigence that has prevented agreement.The British Government do not accept this contention, aswill be apparent from the detailed comments which are attached as an Annex to this Memorandum.    In a desire to avoid sterilecontroversy these have been confined to points of substance,though the British Government, in so limiting themselves, wouldnot wish in any way to imply that they accept the statements insection 2 of the Rhodesian Memorandum of 16 April.They feel bound to draw particular attention to the mostdisappointing feature of the Rhodesian memorandum of 13 February,namely its entirely negative attitude on the question of thesecond safeguard.    The British Government have explained why they regard such a safeguard as essential.    In case there is any misunderstanding they wish to make it clear that, if the regime see difficulty in a safeguard containing an externalelement, the British Government are ready to consider a purelyinternal Rhodesian safeguard so long as it provides an equallyeffective guarantee of the Second Principle.    For example,provided agreement could be reached on the other outstanding points of disagreement, they would be ready to consider a/variant

variant of the alternative (referendum) proposal put forward by Mr. Thomson in Salisbury last November, in which the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council would play no part.    They wouldalso be ready to consider a proposal of the kind indicated byMr. Wilson in the House of Commons on 22 October, 1968, underwhich the Constitution would itself provide that its entrenchedclauses should be unamendable for a period of years.    If neither of these suggestions is acceptable to the regime, the BritishGovernment appeal to them to put forward their own proposalsfor a safeguard that would effectively provide the necessaryguarantees.The British Government share the conviction expressed inthe Rhodesian Memorandum that a settlement is in the interestof both Britain and Rhodesia; and they believe that, given asincere desire for settlement on the Rhodesian side, agreement could still be reached.    But such an agreement can be foundedonly on a genuine and whole-hearted acceptance by the Rhodesianside of the Six Principles by which the approach of successiveBritish Governments to the whole Rhodesian problem has consistentlybeen governed.   Throughout the various discussions which havetaken pjlace the British Government have made it absolutely clearthat they cannot contemplate any settlement which mightundermine or weaken these Principles, which they regard as thefundamental precondition of the creation of a multi-racial society in which Rhodesians of all races can live and work together infreedom, dignity and peace.    They therefore earnestly hope thatthe regime will reflect carefully on what they have said before proceeding as indicated in the last paragraph of the RhodesianMemorandum of 16 April./ANNEXSEOTST

annex the British Government have the following detailed comments on the Rhodesian Memorandum of 1 6 April.It is not the case that, during his visit to Salisbury,Mr. Thomson introduced &quot;conditions never contemplated previously&quot;.All of the major points of disagreement, which he outlined in theHouse of Commons on 18 November, 1968, arose out of Rhodesiansuggestions for departing from the Fearless proposals, which hadalready been published.      If it is suggested that these proposals&quot;provide for an acceleration of African political progress, notenvisaged under the 1961 Constitution&quot;, this is in no wayinconsistent with the First Principle and they follow the TigerF/orking Document in doing so.      On the other hand, unlike the 1961Constitution, both sets of proposals provide for 17 reservedEuropean seats in the Legislative Assembly.There are only three respects in which the RhodesianMemorandum of 13 February could be represented as being intendedto bridge the gap remaining after the Salisbury talks:(a) its suggestion that, while the number of European seats in the Senate should be increased by two (as comparedwith the Fearless proposals), the Fearless figures forthe Legislative Assembly should be left unchanged;(b) the further proposal put forward in respect of the franchise and cross voting;(c) the indication that applications from individual public servants who wished to apply for reinstatement could be examined on their merits./The British

The British Government*s views on these concessions were setout in the British reply of M March.     The last of these concessionsdoes not in any way commit the regime and does not indicate anyacceptance on their part of the principle thatj as part of asettlement, there should be a spirit on both sides of &quot;forgive andforget&quot;.     The British Government have explained in their previousve$ly, why the second concession is apparent rather than real.The first concession, though welcome as far as it goes, is not of major significance.     Like the Fearless proposals it would providefor a blocking quarter of one more vote than the bare minimum;but in comparison with them it would involve an overall increasein European representation, for which no convincing justificationhas been advanced.
