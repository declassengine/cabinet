Is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)............------......-----.........-------.....-.......-----------C(&amp;9) 35 COPY NO, ^CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1969-70Memorandum by the Lord^President jrf-th^CjjuncilIn drawing this programme up, I have had in mind the need toleave ourselves as much freedom of manoeuvre as possible;  and Ihave therefore tried to ensure that the programme as a whole can becompleted without an autumn spill-over period and that, in particular,the major legislation can be completed by the summer Recess.    At thesame time I have allowed for the possibility that the 1969-70 Sessionmight be prolonged (or a short 1970-71) Session introduced) by including at Annex B a supplementary list of Bills which would not be assured of a firm place in the programme, out would be prepared asresources permitted against these contingencies.    In terms of demands on Parliamentary time, the programme, supplementary list apart, isprobably rather lighter than this Session[sj but it will make very heavy demands on the draftsmen,2.      The list of Bills which I suggest for next Sessicn&apos;s programme isgiven in Annex A.    The Bills are classified as usual under thefollowing headingsAl   - 5 f Bi^--^i-y-5   **  that is Bills which must be obtained by a specified date, e, g. because ofthe expiration of other measures;A2   -  Contir^eji^BLlls -  that is Bills which may become essential in the above sense,B     - Main Programme BrillsC     - BHlsJr^Rj^^jrjveB(S) - Bills in the Programme for the Scottish Grand CommitteeS     - Bills suitable for the Second Reading Committee ProcedureP    &amp; Bin^sjuitable.^ -^iY-^^-M^Eik^JL8The remaining Bills which were put forward for next Sessionrsprogramme but are unlikely to find a place in it are listed in Annex C;and a selection cf those has been made, as set out in Annex B, to meetthe contingency of an extended (or additional) Session,

Go ne ral SJtxape- of the ^&quot;Ojgr&amp;norru^3.     The centrepiece of the legislative programme is, as visual, the list B Main Programme Bills, and in particular the four major Bills towhich the Government are already committed - Ij^^^liiLB^J^^0^-!&quot;NatmnaljSur^r/irn^^ J^surajnee, MSJJFiH^-^L^EG&apos;!^ an(^Ports Reorganisation.    The list is a little unbalanced, in that it has ahigh proportion of economic Bills, the majority of which are thoresponsibility of the Board of Trade.    But that arises from the factthat when the bids for this Session were considered, the economic bills had the strongost claim for inclusion.    And, of course, the balancetends to shift from Session to Session;  in the present Session it hasfavoured constitutional Bills, and a swing in emphasis to economic Billsmay well be welcome.4.     For the benefit of departmental Ministers who attended thesecond meeting of the Future Legislation Committee, I set out below the changes I have made in the programme in the light of the discussion atthat meeting.Al - Essential. No changes have been made,A2   -  Qonthjugent^   No changes have been made.and Textiles have been left out and Educa^o^(Con2 rdwnBm^Sc^^ ^l^i^lL^J-0^^jB^t^i?-(s0 ^ar 1&quot; not suitable for Second reading committee) and Productivity Consultants added.     I have assumed thatthere will not be separate Bills on Preservation of Pension Rights and^yi^^^Si^^^llPiHli kut that these will be included in National^LE^^^i^tJ.o^andjla 1 Jnsurance.     This point cannot be settled atthis stage.     On the other hand, I have continued to earmark provisionalplaces for interim legislation on the recommendations of the Seebohrr^Committee on Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services andon the Administrative Structure of the National Health and related services in England and Wales.5,     Textiles the President of the Board of Trade withdrew; and9H!laj5iTi8jsue &amp;-c1jl 1961 ^Amendment) I have taken out to make room for^A1!? litrati/or the Health Service Bills.    Departmental Ministers pressed the claims of a number of Bills to be added to the programme, but in my view the choice lay between those I have selected and Loca^Aj^horities^-9.4.S^n4-^e Yice ?) anc* Highways (Amendment).    I realise that theformer is already prepared, but I do not think that either Bill shoulddisplace those I have selected.-2-S EGRET

6.      In deciding on the changes, I had in mind that the pressure innext Sessionfs programme will probably be on drafting resources evenmore than on Parl5.amentary time.    I do not fthink, however, that thenet effect of the changes should add too much to the load on parliamentary Counsel, provided that the three Bills I have added arekept down to the essential minimum.7.     S.__rJ^^2^^^^^M^l K5^l^^^3.i^:E.i.   ^anj rj^tej^an^Wjnduig-^J^X^^tmjmt^account^ has been added, and C^rriageJ^_Glp^)6LS_b^&apos; ^eaL_moved to the Private Members List.    I have also allowed for thepossibility that Edu ca t Lor^MJ. s c enapeoi^Provis^ons^might be splitinto two Bills.8.     ^iP^l^il^eB^^Jri^J-i.   1 have added Reservoirs (Safety).9.     I invite the Cabinet to approve the programme T put forward forthe 1969-70 Session.    As it now stands, I think it as heavy as we can take on if we wish to be sure of completing it, at least in substance, bythe summer Recess - as we shall want to do, in order to retain freedomof manoeuvre.    &quot;We should not therefore add to it without correspondingdeletions - especially as we must allow for the likelihood that Bills will emerge late which cannot be foreseen now.T   Tp   privy Council Office, S.W. 1.1st April, 1969-3-
