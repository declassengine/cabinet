DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 38COPY NO.22nd April, 1969CABINETTHE HUNT report note by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs at their meeting on 21st April, 1969 the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy invited me to arrange for officials ofthe Departments directly concerned to prepare a paper for circulation to the Cabinet on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.Accordingly a note by officials is attached below.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs,22nd April, 1969

HUNT     CO MM IT I EENote by OfficialsIntermediate areas,    The Hunt Committee have recommended that assistance to industry in the form of a new &quot;building grant at 25 per cent,which unlike the building grant now available in the develop-lent areas would not be linked to the provision of employment,should be made available throughout the North-West and Yorkshireand Humberside planning regions.2,    The Steering Committee on Economic Policy, at their meetingon Monday, 21st April (SEP(69)9th Meeting) decided, subject tothe approval of the Cabinet, that special assistance to industry should be provided on a more selective basis than Hunt recommended.Such assistance would be linked to the provision of new employ-ment and would be limited to the following areas* which are within and outside the Hunt intermediate areas the Yorkshire CoalfieldSouth-East WalesPlymouthPart of North-East Lancashire (including Blackburn andAccrington)North HumbersidePart of the Notts/Derby Coalfield arealeith3*    The exact boundaries would be settled after the regional economic Planning Councils had been consulted.*^hese areas are more specifically defined in Annex A.

4,     Only one level of assistance would &quot;be made available inthese areas.    This would not include investment grants or the regional employment premium.    It would consist of part only ofthe assistance available in the development areas under theLocal Employment Acts ;i - follows: -(i)    Grants at 25 per cent (or in certain cases 35 per cent)of factory building costs;(ii)    Government built factories, either at the request ofa particular firm (custom built factories) or withouta known occupier in mind (advance factories) on thesame basis as in the development areas;(iii)   The full range of development area training grants and other training assistance.5.    General purpose BOTAC loans under the Local Employment Actswould not be made available.    Nor would BOTAC grants, which are provided in certain cases to cover certain incidental expenseson a move to a development area under Section 4 of the local employment Acts.6.    A special programme of advance factories should be introduced for the Yorkshire Coalfield area.SgreUct Land7-    An enlarged national programme for derelict land clearanceand a capital grant at a rate of 75 per cent should be introducedm the specially assisted areas,  in the rest of the North-west and Yorkshire and flumberside planning regions, and throughout the&quot;otts/Derby sub-division of the East Midlands planning region and the North Staffordshire sub-division of the ;.&apos;est MidlandsPlanning region.    The grant would be subject, as in the develop-/ment areas,2

ment areas, to a Board of Trade certificate that clearancewould contribute to the development of industry.    A new programme for clearance of derelict land, establishing priorities, shouldbe drawn up.I.d.c. &apos;&quot;s8.    Within the specially assisted areas industrial developmentcertificates should be available on the same basis as in develop-ment areas.9.    In the rest of the North-West and Yorkshire and Humbersideregions the control would continue to be administered relativelyfreely, except in parts that are congested, as it is at present.10.   The Board of Trade would continue to operate i.d.c. controlso as to give the development areas (and now selected intermediateareas) general priority.    It is however important that sufficientindustry moves to new and expanded towns in other areas to provide employment for the planned growth of population, and the Board ofTrade will have full regard to this in dealing with i.d.c.applications from parent conurbation firms.   Where housing andindustry seems likely to be significantly out of phase this means that i.d.c. policy should be relaxed somewhat, and departments will discuss the detailed arrangements to be made in particular cases.   In some cases a re-adjustment of housing plans may haveto be considered.U.   No other changes would be made in i.d.c.  policy.JMher Bridge12.   Work on the Huniber Bridge and associated roads should startlQ 1972 for- completion in 1976.    As with other major estuarialcrossings tolls would be levied.    This decision would be announced with the publication of the Humberside Report.A3.3

Calder ;yalley7;aftdh0th^r: Roads13,   On the basis of  5 m. a year provision for roads this wouldije entirely absorbed in 1.972/73 and 1973/74 in meeting the costof the llumber Bridge and associated roadworks,,    Prom 1974/75onwards, however,  it -would be possible to use these additionalstuns to advance the starting elate of other roadworks includingthe Calder Valley link road.    Last year the Minister of Transportpublicly accepted the case for a new or improved road link betweenthe Calder Valley and the L. 6 but the standard of construction and timing of the link has yet to be decided.    Without special priority major road improvements to provide a link road in theCalder Valley would find a place in the road programme in thelate 1970s in time to match the provision of the proposed CentralLancashire hew Town.    The provision of  5 m. a year from 1974/75would, however,  permit major construction to begin in that year.To advance the Calder Valley road to 1973/74 or 1972/73 would meanproviding sufficient for that road and the llumber Bridge in thoseyears i.e.  10 m. a year.H.   If the cost of providing the Humber Bridge and the CalderValley road did not fully absorb the sums allocated to roads fromthe investment grant- savings (e.g.  if more than  5 m. a year wasmade available) it would also be possible to undertake smallerlink roads and trave 1 -1o-work schemes in the Intermediate AreasI3.g. in South Yorkshire) from 1972/73 onwards.    But the priority of such schemes could only be decided after discussion with the regional Planning Councils and local authorities concerned.Costs15-   The estima/bed gross full-year public expenditure cost ofthese measures would be approximately as follows4

  millionBuilding grants and Government factories(excluding special programme of advancefactories in the Yorkshire Coalfield)10. special programme of advance factories.5Iraining.8Derelict Land3Roads519.516.   A geographical breakdown of the estimate for building grants and factories is given in Annex A.    As regards clearance of derelict land the figure shown assumes an increase of 50 percent or  2 m. a year in approved commitments by local authorities which, because of the time-lags between commitments and expenditure,would result in less than  2 hi. extra annual expenditure initiallybut more than  2 m. thereafter.    The rate of grant does not directly affect the amount of public expenditure, but does affect the proportions borne by central government on the one hand and localauthorities on the other.    The figure for roads assumes that notmore than  5 m. would be spent in any one year as part of these special measures for the intermediate areas and as an. additionto the normal road programme;   but, if this were allocated in thefirst place to advancing the start of the liumber Bridge, and ifthe later expenditure on the bridge were later absorbed into thenormal road programme, the  5 m.  could then be allocated to a&quot;alder Valley road scheme, if that were decided, or to other road schemes.    This would enable the Calder Valley Road also to be advanced, or &quot;other schemes to be undertaken, on the basis that theMinistry of Transport would meet the minor preparatory costs out^ the normal road programme.A7.5

The resource content of this expenditure ivould be high,i.e. the demand on resources would be close to the grossexpenditure involved.    The package discussed above would there-fore, in terms of resource use, exceed the proposed savingdiscussed below, even if the roads element is not raised above 5 m. a year.Savings19.   After&quot;consideration of possible alternative savings in thefield of assistance to industry, a preference has been reachedfor a reduction from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in the rate of/investment6r7.   There should be little new expenditure on any of these measures in 1969/70, because in general commitments cannot be incurred in advance of the new legislation which is required.Expenditure on some items, especially the Board of Trade programmes,could be substantial in 1970/71,  though still falling short ofa full year&apos;s costs, which would not arise before 1971/73 or1972/73.    The  5 m. figure for expenditure on the Humber Bridgev/ould not be reached until 1972/73.    The following is a ratherspeculative table of the possible phasing of the various items:-1969/70 1970/71 1971/72 1972/73&quot;1973/74 1974/75

investment grant paid on eligible capital expenditure in the manufacturing, construction and extractive industries in thedevelopment areas.    This would affect primarily the private sector, as the steel industry is the only nationalised industry which receives investment grant on its main activities;    other nationalised industries receive the grant only on certain ancillaryactivities.    There would be no change in the 20 per cent rate of grant paid on such equipment outside development; areas nor in the20 per cent- rate which is paid on ships and computers without anyregional differential.20.   The full-year saving from this is estimated at about  25 m.a year.   However, there is an interval of 12 months between theincurring of capital expenditure by firms and the payment of grant on it.    That is, grant is paid 12 months in arrears, andthus the saving from the cut would arise after a time-lag of 12months.   Moreover, in order to avoid the need for generaltransitional arrangements, it is proposed to give a year&apos; o noticeof the reduction.    Thus,  the saving will not begin to accrueuntil two years from, the date of the announcement,  i. e.  in 1971/72.The Board of Trade are urgently considering what special arrange-monts may be necessary for large long-term projocts such as thoaluminium smelters;    this would reduce the total saving.21.   As we are already part way into 1969/70, the saving in1971/72 will in any case be somewhat less than a full-year1ssaving, unless the announcement states that the reduced (35 percent) rate of grant will be paid on capital expenditure incurredftoiii 1st April 1970 onwards - thus giving slightly less than ayearhs notice of the change.    If the reduced rate applied to capital expenditure incurred from any later date,  e.g. 1st July1970, as being the beginning of a new quarter, there would be/only a7

only a part year!s saving in 1971/72 and the first full year&apos;ssaving would not arise until 1972/73.22.   In either case the problem year from the point of view ofcovering costs by savings would be 1970/71.    Departments shouldca able to-absorb any costs arising in 1969/70.    The Transportaid Housing Departments should also have little difficulty inabsorbing in their orctramres of e^^eiiditure the limited extracosts likely to arise in 1970/71 cn the number Bridge and clearance of derelict land respectively.    There should be scope for thedepartment of Employment and Productivity to deal similarly with my costs in 1970/71 of extending their special training programmesfros the development areas to the intermediate areas.    Bat theBoard of Trade cannot undertake similarly to absorb the new   .expenditure failing on their votes in 1970/71. which might thenbe running at  6 m. a year or more,    This would therefore be asharge on the general contingency reserve cr, if necessary, onsavings to be secured in public expenditure generally.23.   The saving in resource terms f:,om a cat in investment grantsis substantially less than the gross money saving.    In the firstplace there is a substantial offset through lower tax paid oy theiiras, thus producing a smaller net money saving.    After takingifflto account the demand effect of this, it is estimated that agfoss saving of  25 m. on investment grants would produce a saving- of roughly  61- -  12* m.  in resource terms.8

ANNEX estimated cost of building grants ,and government factories in intermediate areasNote   :    The method of calculation employed is to take the insured population in the proposed locations in the intermediate areas as a percentage of the insured population of the development areas, and to applythis percentage to the estimated cost of buildinggrants and Government factories in the development areas in 1969/70.    The resulting figures Lire subjectto error, especially in the case of small individuallocations.c/o of EstimatedDevelopment full-year______jyceas_______      _______cost_______Yorkshire CJoalfijsldBarnsley, Castleford, Doncaster,.Hemsworth and Iiexborough Groups,Dunnington, Maltfby, Rotherham, -Take-field and Yorksop 8.2 3.2Worth Bas t Lan c as hi r e(a) Burnley, Nelson and RawtenstallGroups, Barnoldswick andTodmorden 2.3 .9(b) Blackburn and Accrington 2.2 .south.
