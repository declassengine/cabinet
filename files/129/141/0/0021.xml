THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTANNEX AForeign and Commonwealth Office telegram to Salisbury No. 19b of 7 March, 1969My immediately preceding telegram.Following is text of reply.Begins.The British Government are as concerned as ever to achievean honourable settlement,  acceptable to the people of Rhodesia asa whole.    It was their concern to do this which led the PrimeMinister to invite Mr. Smith to meet him in H.M.S. Fearless inOctober, 1968; and it was again this concern which led him to propose that Mr. George Thomson should visit Salisbury in November,1968, to discover whether the differences remaining after theFearless talks could not he resolved.    It is also because of their concern forVa settlement that the British Government have kept theFearless proposals (as modified as a result of the talks in salisbury) &quot;on the table&quot; in the hope that Mr. Smith and hiscolleagues would either decide to accept those proposals or ^elsemake alternative suggestions of their own which might form thebasis of a satisfactory settlement.2.      The British Government have accordingly given the memorandumenclosed in Mr. Clarke&apos;s letter of 13 February careful study.They had noted Mr. Smith&apos;s statement on 13 December 1968 that hehad a &quot;plan to use in the remaining time which is available inorder&quot;to reach a settlement with 3ritain&quot; and that he had alreadyconfided it to &quot;many leading Rhodesians&quot;.    They feel bound topoint out that the Rhodesian memorandum of 13 February is not in/any

any real sense a plan for a settlement.    It is, with the exceptionof one or two marginal changes commented on below, simply areiteration of the negative positions adopted by Mr. Smith and hiscolleagues at the conclusion of their talks with Mr-. Thomson inNovember 1968.    There can be no disguising the fact that thememorandum, the first substantive communication from the regimesince the end of the talks with Mr. Thomson in November 1968, isa very disappointing document.3.      The British Government&apos;s comments on the various matters dealt with in the Rhodesian memorandum are as follows.Second Safeguardh.     The British Government cannot accept that the suggesteddifficulty over securing a three-quarters majority in theLegislature makes superfluous a second safeguard against amendmentof the Constitution.    While it may be true that it would not always be an entirely simple matter to achieve a majority of three-quarters, they cannot accept that such difficulties would themselves amount to any adequate guarantee such as is called forin both the first and second principles.   As Mr. George Thomson,the Minister Without Portfolio, pointed out in the House ofCommons on 22 October, 1968: &quot;It is not any slight on Rhodesia oron its white population to point out the real danger that, if theprevention of a crucial amendment depends on a small block of votes, pressures of one kind or another, whether private or public, may be brought to bear on some members of theparliamentary minority to persuade them to vote with the majority.If there was a bare &quot;blocking quarter&quot; it would be necessary to/secure

secure only one or two such votes to turn the scale&quot;.5.     The British Government&apos;s view on this is not affected hy thefact that the memorandum of 13 February agrees, as the BritishGovernment have long insisted, that there should be one moreelected African representative than is required to constitute theminimum blocking quarter.    It will be noted from the abovequotation that Mr. Thomson spoke of the necessity to secure&quot;one or two&quot; votes to turn the scale.Composition^ of the  ^Legislature6.     As regards the composition of the Legislature described inSection 2 of the memorandum, the British Government note that itis now proposed to create two additional European seats in the senate.    Mr. George Thomson indicated in Salisbury in November 1968and later in the House of Commons that such increases in the numberof European seats were unacceptable to us.    In any case, as it isintended that the Senate&apos;s main independent role should be in thefield of African affairs,  it seems unnecessary to secure equalityin the numbers of European and African seats.Franchise and Cross Voting7.     As regards Section 3 of the memorandum,  on &quot;franchise andcross voting&quot;,  the Minister Without Portfolio explained during theSalisbury talks in November, 1968, why the various suggestionslisted in the memorandum of 13 February were unacceptable to theBritish Government;  the reasons which he then gave, and which are summarised in the memorandum remain cogent.    The new suggestionstill fails to meet the British Government&apos;s position.    In their view the proposed extension of the B roll franchise qualifications/is

SECHEYis not enough in itself, since the right of election for thoseholding the extended qualifications is limited to the 15 B Roll seats.    In order to satisfy the third principle there must be asubstantial increase in the number of Africans eligible to take part in the electoral process.    Such an enlargement of the numbersof those eligible to participate would be robbed of any realsignificance if their votes were deprived of the value in A rollelections which the 1961 Constitution conferred on B roll votes.8.     The British Government would further point out that theliteracy qualification which they suggest for B roll voters is if anything stricter than what already applies to chiefs and headmen(in respect of the A roll franchise).9.     The contention in the Rhodesian memorandum that it would heinconsistent with the first principle to accept any provision thatwould lead to faster African progress than under the 1961Constitution is incorrect, regardless of the question (on which morethan one view can be held) whether taken as a whole the Tiger/Fearless proposals would in fact bring about majority rule faster than the 1961 Constitution or not.Delimitation andj^Overri.din^c^ectivgj^PorjmJLa10.      The British Government attach great importance to theinclusion of the &quot;overriding objective&quot; formula in order to ensure a fair and proportionate chance for Africans to win A roll seatsas the number of Africans who qualify for the A roll increases.It is clear from both the British and Rhodesian published records of the Tiger talks that the working party on board H.M.S. Tiger/presented

SECKEtrpresented this formula not as a substitute for the entrenchmentof Section 37 but as an addition to it.    The formula is requirednot because of any doubts of the fairness &quot;with which the delimitation commission would perform its functions but because,without it, their terms of reference would be such as could require them to produce an undesirable result.    Paragraph 9 above is alsoapplicable to the comment in this section about providing anaccelerator not available in the 1.961 Constitution.Appeals in ordinary matters .^g-J^^^rX^^S?o^lQ^L11.     The British Government have carefully studied the objections raised in the memorandum to the retention of appeals in ordinarycases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.    Manyindependent Commonwealth countries including some v/hich are notpart of H.M. Dominions have retained the system of appeals to the privy Council and see nothing in it which derogates from their independence.     The Judicial Committee has long experience indealing v/ith appeals from countries whose legal system is Roman/Dutch.12.     The British Government do not intend any reflection on the integrity of Rhodesian judges.    The point is that the JudicialCommittee is a Court which commands unique and worldwide respect and agreement to send final appeals from Rhodesia to it would bean important consideration in satisfying the internationalcommunity of the propriety of the all but unique step of agreeing to independence before majority rule.13.     The British Government do not accept that problems in this field about the validity of legislative and administrative acts/in

in Rhodesia since the illegal declaration of independence could, not he overcome.Duration of State of Emergency-1k.     The British Government have taken note of the fact mentionedin your memorandum that Mr. Smith and his colleagues have purported to extend from 3 months to 12 months the period for which a stateof emergency could be declared.    This was one of the major points in dispute between the two sides at the November talks in Salisbury.The fact that Mr. Smith and his colleagues have chosen to takeunilateral action in this way on one of those points is a matterof deep regret to the British Government.    They can only conclude that Mr. Smith and his colleagues were ready deliberately to widen the gap at a time when the British Government had shown their good faith in the search for a settlement by leaving their Fearlessproposals on the table.   The British Government can only repeattheir position that in their view to extend from three to twelvemonths the period for which a state of emergency could be put intoeffect is neither necessary nor desirable.   As Mr. Thomson said inthe House of Commons on 18 November: &quot;Honourable Members in all parts of the House will share our deep concern over a proposal which would mean lengthening the period for which Rhodesiancitizens will be held in detention without charge or trial, andwithout the Rhodesian Parliament having the opportunity to scrutinise the need for the state of emergency and, if thoughtproper, to end it.&quot;15.     The arguments in the Rhodesian memorandum concerningparliamentary powers in relation to a state of emergency are not/wholly

wholly convincing.    Under the procedure prescribed bySection 72(2)(B) of the 1961 Constitution, parliamentary approvalis not required for the initial period for which a state ofemergency is declared by the executive Government.    Parliament&apos;power to limit a state of emergency which has been so declared doosnot apply in respect to that initial period but only in respect ofa period of renewal.Grounds for continued Detention and Restriction16.     The British Government would certainly wish to preserve, asthe Minister Without Portfolio said in Parliament on 18 November1968: &quot;An adequate safeguard for the preservation of public order&quot;;but they consider the existing wording of the Fearless document onthis point does this and they could not agree to the proposal inSection 7 of the memorandum.Return of Public Servants17,     The British Government&apos;s position on this matter was setout by Mr. Thomson in the House of Commons on 18 November, 1968 asfollows: &quot;We feel that, as part of the necessary process of wipingthe slate clean, if a settlement was reached, they / Rhodesianpublic servants/ should have the choice of reinstatement or compensation&quot;.    The British Government are accordingly unable to regard the suggestion made in the memorandum of 13 February as acceptable.StewartRhodesia (Secret) DistributionR.P.D.

DEPARTMENT OP THE PRIMS MINISTER,Private Bag 700, CAUSEWAY,SALISBURY.13th February, 1969.Dear Carter,Thank you for your letter of 4th February, 1969.    Since itsreceipt and, indeed, since Mr. Thomson&apos;s last visit to Salisbury,the Rhodesian Government have been giving careful and deepconsideration to their position on the Fearless proposals.I am now instructed by my Prime Minister to enclose for transmission to the British Government for their consideration a memorandum which contains the conclusions of the rhodesian government on the points of difference between the two governments which were left unresolved at the end of the talks with Mr. Thomsonin November.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   G.B. ClarkeP.A. Carter, Esq.,Head of the British Residual Mission,Salisbury.SFCRFT

memorandum the FEARLESS PROPOSALS:   POINTS OF DIFFERENCEThe Rhodesia Government have given further consideration to theproposals formulated by the British Government on board HMS Fearless and,in particular, to the points of difference between the two Governmentslisted by Mr. Thomson at the end of his last visit to Salisbury and referred to by him in his report to the House of Commons on the18th November I968.   The Rhodesia government have fully re-appraisedtheir approach to the problems and now set out their proposals underthe appropriate headings.1.     Second safeguard the Rhodesia Government disagree in principle that any secondsafeguard is necessary.    They consider that it is illogical to require a further safeguard if the first safeguard, that is, the blocking quarter in Parliament, is effective.   They believe that the blocking quarteralone is a more than adequate safeguard bearing in mind the proposedcomposition of the two Houses of Parliament.   Before an amendment to anentrenched clause could be passed three-quarters of the total membership would be required to vote in its favour.    The total membership will comprise six different categories of members:  *A&apos; Roll,  &apos;B&apos; Poll,Reserved European, African Senators, European Senators and Chiefs.Superimposed upon these six categories will be a further division intoat least two racial groups and within the categories there will be sub-divisions into a number of political parties possessing differing policies.The practical difficulty of persuading three-quarters of these members tosupport a common line must be obvious.The Rhodesia Government are therefore unable to agree with theBritish G-overnment that a blocking quarter amounts to a fragile safeguard,but to meet the British point of view are willing to accept the strengthening of this safeguard by providing a blocking quarter plusone of the elected members in addition to the six Chiefs in theLegislature.2,     Composition of the LegislatureThe Rhodesia Government are unable to accept the compositionproposed in the Fearless talks because it does not secure equalitybetween European and African members in the Senate; but they are-1-SECRET

prepared to offer the following alternative which they believe shouldbe acceptable to the British Government because the same number of elected African seats is retained in the Senate and, in accordance withthe Rhodesian proposal under paragraph 1  above, more than a bareblocking quarter is secured.Legislative Assembly*Ar Roll seats,Bt Roll seatsReserved European seatsSenateEuropean seatsAfrican seatsTotal LegislatureBlocking quarter33.17:14149524 ((((Each block of seats to cover the whole countryElected by Europeans on the&apos;A&apos; Roll8 elected by Africans cn the &apos;A&apos; andlB&apos; Rolls voting together and Chiefs, 3 representing Mashonalandand 3 representing Hatabeleland,elected by the Provincial Assembliesof ChiefsElected members 25Chiefs 6Block provided 313.     Franchise and cross-votingThe British Government&apos;s proposal is that the ,B! Roll franchiseshould be extended to all Africans over 30 years of age whilst the cross-voting influence on *A&apos; Roll seats is retained at 25 per cent.   the rhodesia Government are unable to agree because -(a) it Yfould enable unsophisticated and illiterate Africans to exert influence on the ,AI Roll seats; and(b) it would provide accelerated African progress beyond that envisaged under the 1961 Constitution.It is to be noted that such accelerated advancement is not consistent with the British first principle.In a spirit of compromise, however, the Rhodesia Government havemade several alternative proposals in which a reduction in the lB&apos; Rollfranchise qualifications would be accompanied by a corresponding reduction-2-

of the cross-voting influence, despite the fact that under theseproposals unsophisticated and illiterate voters would retain someinfluence on the fA&apos; Roll seats.   The Rhodesia Government have beenprepared to accept any of the alternatives set out hereunder -IB! Roll qualification cross-voting, m^mm.- -i. ,.  ,- influence(a) Retention of existing &apos;Bl Roll 25 per centqualifi communication ons(b) Extension of xBl Roll to all 20 per centAfricans over 30 years of age pluspresent literacy test(c) Extension of &apos;BI Roll to all 15 per centAfricans over 30 years of age plus a simple literacy test(d) Extension of &apos;B&apos; Roll to all 10 per centAfricans over 30 years of agewithout any literacy testAll these alternatives were rejected by Mr. Thomson on thegrounds that -(i)   they were inconsistent with the principle of immediateimprovement in the political status of Africans; and(ii)   they would have an adverse effect on the time scale for african advancement; and(iii)   they would diminish the chance of a non-racial approach to politicsIf the British Government still find that none of these alternative proposals is acceptable, the following further proposal, in which the rhodesia. Government have sought to meet the British criticisms mentionedabove, is offered.It is proposed that the ,BI Roll should be extended to all Africansover 30 years of age and no literacy test would be imposed.   There would be two standards of qualifications for the lB&apos; Roll.   The higher standardwould be set at the existing level.   In addition, there would be a lower qualification allowing the enrolment of all Africans over-3-

30 years of age who could sign their names on tho application form for registration.     The cross-voting would he retained at 25 per cent for those holding the higher standard of qualification.   There would he nocross-voting for those enrolled with the lower standard of qualification.The proposal has the following advantages -(a) hy retaining the 25 per oent cross-voting influence for those with existing qualifications the time scale of African advancement,as envisaged in the 1961 Constitution, will be maintained;(b) enrolment of a large number of Africans gives them an immediateimprovement in their political status whilst at the same time theproposal meets the Rhodesian argument that unsophisticated andilliterate voters should not be allowed to influence the &apos;A&apos; Roll seats.4.     Delimitation and &quot;over-ri ding objective&apos;\ jFormulaIt will be remembered that originally the Rhodesia G-overnment were unwilling to accept the entrenchment of section 37 of the 1961 Constitutionbecause it would prevent any enlargement of Parliament to meet the needsof a growing country unless the procedure for amending the entrenchedclauses were adopted.   For this reason the &quot;over-riding objective&quot;formula was drawn up.   It was intended to allow for the natural enlargement of Parliament without going through the procedure for entrenched clauses.In fact, it introduced a completely different concept; an unorthodoxform of proportional representation which would accelerate Africanadvancement.   In effect, the British Government want the Constitution tobe reinforced not merely to the extent of ensuring normal Africanadvancement but also of providing an accelerator which was not availablein the 1961 Constitution and which is inconsistent v/ith their firstprinciple.For the sake of a settlement the Rhodesia Government were and areprepared to accept the entrenchment not only of section 37 but also of &quot;section 38.   Thus the purpose for which the over-riding formulawas originally drafted falls away.-4-

The Rhodesia G-overnment can only conclude from the insistence on the inclusion of the formula that the British G-overnment do nottrust the delimitation commission to carry out its duties fairly.   the rhodesia Government consider it unthinkable that the commission, headed by the Chief Justice, will not in the future, as in the past, fulfilits functions with absolute integrity, impartiality and justice to allvoters regardless of race.After full consideration the Rhodesia Covernment must reiteratethe stand they have consistently taken that the formula is unnecessary,objectionable and entirely unacceptable.5.     Appeals in ordinary matters to the Pri vyg CouncilDuring Mr. Thomsons last Tdsit to Salisbury he expressed surprisewhen told that the Privy Council would not be acceptable to rhodesia  a final court of appeal in ordinary civil and criminal cases.   Inorder to satisfy themselves that their attitude was reasonable the rhodesia G-overnment have undertaken a more detailed inquiry into thereasons which prompted the rejection of the Privy Council by many other commonwealth countries.   The evidence which has emei&quot;ged reinforces their view that it could only be against the interests of Rhodesia to accept such an appeal system.Canada, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Eire andother countries have abolished their appeals to the Privy Council, insome cases not without difficulty.   Because the members of the privy council were unfamiliar with local law and conditions it sometimes led tounrealistic decisions and a lack of uniformity in the interpretation ofthe law.   The great expense and delay involved in taking appeals toLondon from distant places were additional and not unimportant factors in persuading these countries to terminate appeals to the Privy Council.However, the principal reason was precisely stated in a paper arisingfrom the Third Commonwealth and Empire Law Conference which took place atSydney, Australia, in 19^5 and a quotation therefrom is appropriate -&quot;Although there may have been peculiar end indigenous reasons ineach territory for the elimination of the right of appeal there was alsoa main motive common to all territories, namely, the feeling thathowover valuable the right of appeal had been in the days of colonial-5-SECRET

status it was not compatible with the dignity of a mature and independent sovereign state that cases should go for revision from thehighest court of the territory to a court sitting in England andcomposed largely of United Kingdom judges.It was frequently pointed out that sovereignty is divided into three parts, legislative, executive and judicial, and that as the legislatures and executive bodies of the independent territories wereipso facto not subject to any legislature or executive body outside their frontiers there was every reason why their courts should not besubject to any court outside their frontiers&quot;.No cogent argument has emerged in favour of retaining appeals tothe Privy Council and it is clear to the Rhodesia Government that itwould be quite wrong to incorporate in their Constitution the system which has proved unacceptable to so many other countries.In the case of Rhodesia there are other compelling reasons whyappeals to the Privy Council should not be reintroduced.   In 1891, itwas provided that the law to be administered in Rhodesia would be thelaw in force in the Cape Colony on the 10th June, 1891 s and theapplication of this law has been preserved by the 1961 and 19^5Constitutions.   Thus Rhodesia and South Africa share the same systemof common lav?, namely, Roman-Dutch law.   It is desirable that uniformity in the interpretation of this law is maintained by the courts of rhodesia and South Africa, so that judicial precedent in South Africamay serve as a guide to Rhodesian courts and vice versa..   Decisions byjudges of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council who areinexperienced in the day-to-day administration of Roman-Dutch law would impair this uniform approach.   The intrusion of rulings by lawyerstrained in the English system of law could lead to a divergence in theinterpretation of the law in Rhodesia from that in South Africa.The present schism existing between the Rhodesian High Court andthe Privy Council militates against any rapprochement.   Apart from thequestion of expecting the judges of the Rhodesian High Court to returnto the position pertaining prior to the present rift, there is thenecessity, that all Rhodesian legislation since the 11th November, I965should be recognised under British law.   As was pointed out to

Mr. Thomson, if appeals to the Privy Council wore retained it wouldhe necessary for the British G-overnment to enact legislation validatingevery lav;, order, regulation, bye-law, financial^ judicial andadministrative measure passed or done in Rhodesia since the11th November 19&amp;5 since the Judicial Committee of the Privy Counciloperates under British law and in the absence of such validation wouldnot recognise such laws or measures as having legal effect in Rhodesia.The suggestion that the British G-government would be Tailing toconsider Rhodesian legislation and administrative acts and validate thosewhich in their opinion were passed or done &quot;in good faith&quot; would notsolve the difficulty.     Even assuming the readiness of the BritishGovernment to validate all legislative and administrative acts, includingthe 1965 Constitution and amendments thereto, which is not implied intheir suggestion, a &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach would inevitably omit some actor measure which could later be challenged in the courts.Moreover, the Rhodesia Government fail to understand the importance attached to the inclusion of appeals to the Privy Council in the rhodesian Constitution when the integrity of the Rhodesian High Courtis not in doubt.   They regard it as a remnant of colonial days, a symbolof inferiority which only those imbued with a colonial philosophy would wish to see continued.   The Rhodesia Government believe that there is anincontrovertible case in support of their rejection of appeals to the privy Council.6.     Duration of state of emergency in accordance with their programme the Rhodesia Government haverecently introduced, a.nd Parliament has passed, legislation extending the period to a maximum of twelve months at a time for which a stateof emergency may be declared, or renewed.   The extension was necessary and is entirely justified when one considers the external threat to rhodesia, including terrorist incursions which are unlikely to ceaseeven if a settlement were to be reached.   A period of twelve monthswas evidently considered necessary in some other Commonwealth countries and justifiable in the eyes of the British Government responsible for granting these countries their independence constitutions.   Rhodesia-7-

faces threats no less serious than those facing those other countries and needs equal facilities to deal with them.     The Rhodesia Governmentare responsible for maintaining law and order in Rhodesia and aresatisfied that the proposed  period is justified.No question of principle is involved hero, only one of degree.The British G-overnment concede that the right to declare a state ofemergency must rest in Parliament and only the maximum period of theemergency is in dispute.It is pointed out that Parliament is not obliged to authorise astate of emergency fox- the maximum period; it may decide that it isnooessary only for a shorter period.   Furthermore, it may at any time during a state of emergency scrutinise the need for it and, if itthinks fit, terminate it.7.     Grounds for continued detention^g.a^jrestrictigoiiThe British Government insist that the tribunal which reviews thecases of detainees and restrictees should not authorise their furtherdetention or restriction unless -&quot;they are affirmatively satisfied that, having regard to theirpast activities, the persons conoernod are likely to commit orincite or conspire to commit acts of violence or intimidation&quot;.The Rhodesia G-overnment agree that further detention should beauthorised on these grounds but believe that as they stand it could result in the release of individuals whose presence in the community would lead to violence and intimidation.     Purely in the interests ofmaintaining law and order they wish to see a slight widening of these grounds to cover this eventuality by the addition to tho grounds of thefollowing words -&quot;or that violence or intimidation is likely to occur if thoperson concerned is released&quot;.Bearing in mind that all oases of detainees and restrictees willbe reviewed by the judicial tribunal, one member of which will be nominated by the British Lord Chancellor, the grounds for detentionsuggested by the Rhodesia Government aro justified in order thai lav;and order will be maintained.

8.     Return&apos; of public servantsUnder the Fearless proposals, the British Government required the rhodesia Government to reinstate those civil servants who had lefttheir posts after 11th November 19^5 and who had been accepted under theBritish government&apos;s scheme and who wished to return to Rhodesia if asettlement were reached.   During Mr. Thomson1 s visit to Rhodesia inNovember 1968 he added a further requirement that the individuals concerned should be given a choice either to return to their posts or alternatively to have tho right to receive compensation for loss ofpension and loss of career.The Rhodesia Government are unable to agree to either of theseproposals but are prepared to examine on their merits applications fromindividuals who may wish to apply for reinstatement.   They consider thatthe question of granting compensation to public servants and others wholeft their posts after 11th November 1965 con be considered during a discussion on a financial settlement between Rhodesia and Great Britain.Prime Ministers OfficeSalisbury,13th February, 19^9-9-
