C(69) 41 COPY NO.___28th April, 1969CABINETREPLY TO THE REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE on nationalised INDUSTRIES ON &quot;MINISTERIAL CONTROL OFTHE NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES&quot;Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy, on 4th March, invited me:-(i)   to arrange for the draft reply to the Select Committee *Q Reporton &quot;Ministerial Control of the Nationalised Industries&quot; to be amended on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up;(ii)   in consultation with the Ministers concerned to arrange for the revised draft reply to be sent to the Chairmen of the nationalised Industries for their comments;(iii)   to circulate the final draft of the White Paper to the Cabinet forapproval.2.       A revised version of the reply was agreed by the ministers concerned at the end of March and sent to the Chairmen.    for convenience, the revised paragraphs are sidelined in the text which follows (paragraphs 8 and 16).    The Chairmen&apos;3 comments have since been considered by officials of the Departments concerned, and I attach a note by thern, covering a draft of the reply which embodies some further slight revision in the light of the Chairmen^ comments(underlined in the text).    I invite my colleagues to approve this text for publication.3.       Officials also make proposals for the handling of the reply;  i recommend that these should be approved.R.H.

NOTE BY OFFICIALSWe have examined the comments from the Chairmen of the nationalised industries on the draft reply to the Select committee report.   Eleven of the Chairmen have replied, of whom seven madecommento of substance.    Nine of them generally favoured the mainlines of the draft.    Few specific amendments have been proposed.Some of these are based on misunderstandings.    Others have been dealt with by minor amendments to tho draft.    There was a generaltendency to seek to make propaganda for the industries&apos; case thatthey should not be subjected to undue interference by the Government.2,    Tho most critical comments came from the Chairman of theBritish Steel Corporation (who was not among the Chairmen who gave evidence to the Select Committee).    He v/ould like the reply to be revised at various points so as to promise greater commercialfreedom to the industries, and a large measure of independence ofGovernment control, once broad objectives had. been given them.3.    Ho criticises in particxilar the section (paragraphs 27-33)dealing with the investment of the nationalised industries, andsuggests that paragraph 28 &quot;should be altered so as to bring outunequivocally that the Governments policy is to exercise no morethan strategic control and that their scrutiny of individual projects will be directed solely to the social implications ofthese projects&quot;.    This suggestion seems to us to be completelyAcceptable.    The Government cannot be expected to interest itselfln nothing more than the social implications of, e.g. the location^ method fuelling of a new power station, the siting of a new steel&quot;Wks, or the re-equipment of the Airways Corporations.1

:,t   He also &quot;greatly regrets the failure [of the draft reply] toHeal fully with the criticisms of the present system as they are$pressed in Chapter XVIII of the Report (&quot;What Has Gone Wrong&quot;)and summarised in paragraph hO, most of which seems to me and to mycolleagues to be justified&quot;.    Paragraph hO of the Report reads:    &quot;in chapter XVIII, the Committee conclude, to put it simply, that ministers have largely done the opposite of what Parliament intended,fliey were supposed to lay down policies - in particular for the wholeof their sectors of the economy - which would guide the operations ofthe individual industries, but not &quot;to intervene in the management ofthe industries in implementing those policies.    In practice, until recently, they have given the industries very little policy guidancetat they have become closely involved in many aspects of management,(inch of the fault, the Committee believe, has sprung from confusionabout responsibilities and about purposes.&quot;5i   It hardly seems realistic to expect the Government to endorsestatements of this character1.    The draft reply naturally concentrateson the Select Committee&apos;s specific proposals for future action, andtoes not attempt to comment on its rather one-sided analysis of pasthistory.   The Report is very discursive, running to over 200 pages,lo answer it point by point would necessitate a very long, and frequently contentious reply, which we judged would be unnecessaryWl provocative.&quot;   Somewhat similar, though less emphatic, comments were made by to Chairman of B.E.A.&apos;&apos;   The revised draft reply incorporates some amendments toI^-graphs 28 and 31 * which are designed to acknowledge some of these-^icisms so far as this is possible without making unacceptableSessions on major questions of policy..CONFIDENTIAL

8,    The remaining comments are mainly points of clarification ordetail and come small amendments aru proposed.    &apos;^he amendments areunderlined in the attached revised version of the draft.9,    The S.E.P. Committee noted that the Prime Minister would give further consideration to the question whether the reply should-hepresented to Parliament by himself or by the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The Prime Minister has since indicated that he will present the White Paper himself.10.   It is proposed - subject to agreement on precise dates throughthe usual machinery - to publish the reply in the week beginning12th May.    It is also suggested that Confidential Final Revises mightbe sent to the Chairman of the Select Committee and to the chairmen of the nationalised industries, i+8 hours ahead of publication.    Pressarrangements can be co-ordinated by the Treasury in consultation withother Departments.11.  Ministers will wish to consider which of them should reply toany debate on the report and the reply.M0MMB3mi,TION12,  The revised text of the draft reply is submitted for ministerial approval.    The arrangements for publication and subsequent handling are also submitted for consideration by Ministers.23rd April 1 969CONF5DENTIAL

g^Ajoril, 196QDRAFT REPLY TO SSL5CT COMMITTEE ON NATIONALI3SD INDUSTRIESOBSERVATIONS BY H.M.  GOVERNMENT ON THE FIRST REPORT FROMTH-S SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES SESSION1967-68 ON &quot;MINISTERIAL OD NTROL OF THE nationalised industries&quot;&quot;introduction the Government welcome this valuable and comprehensive Report,ihich reviews the developing relationship between Ministers and the nationalised Industries.    They understand the Committee&apos;s main thesisto be that Ministers have two quite separate responsibilities giving riseto two distinct functions in this connection.    One is their responsi-biiity for the efficiency, in the economic and financial sense, of theIndustries themselves.   The other is their responsibility for the widerpublic interest.!i The Government accept that these two responsibilities can beraceptually distinguished.    For the reasons given in paragraphsU-1 0Mow, they do not draw the organisational c conclusion w hich theCommittee itself draws from this analysis:    that the two responsibilities -give rise to separable and distinct functions which would be best&quot;epcised by different departments.   The Government do however agree!M the Committee that these two responsibilities need to be recognised,&quot;order to clarify consideration of the objectives of Ministers andlt toe industries.   Many of the remaining recommendations of they*ittee are designed to secure this clarification, and the Government&apos;accept them accordingly, as explained below.These recommendations, and the analysis contained in the Report,to the Government to be as applicable and valid within the

fesent departmental organisation as within the alternative structurepoposed by the Committee.   The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s-cognition of the very considerable progress which has been made in,cent years in formulating and publishing statements of Governmentjlicy towards the nationalised industries.    In particular they notejat the Committee endorses the general policy contained in the Whitejoer, Cmnd. 3k37, on &quot;Nationalised Industries:   A Review of EconomiciFinancial Objectives&quot;.Ministry of Nationalised Industries, The Government have given very careful consideration to the closely^ued case in the Select Committee&apos;s Report (paragraphs 890-930) forMinistry of Nationalised Industries.    They have, however, concluded at the disadvantages of a major change in the machinery of governmentthese lines would substantially outweigh the advantages.First, while it is true that the requirements of efficiency in oneJfthe industries and the wider public interest (using both terms ine sense in which they were used by the Committee) may sometimes conflictparticular cases, it does not necessarily follow that the decision-ping process would be improved if the two interests were the responsi-lity of different Ministers.    There would inevitably be an initialntticap in that decisions now involving one Minister w ould commonly&quot;olye two, informal consultation within a single Departmentcessarily giving way to more formal exchanges between two.   And aflarisation of responsibility, under which the Minister responsiblefsector policy had no responsibility for efficiency,  and thelister responsible for efficiency no responsibility for the widerttonal interest, would not of itself be any guarantee that either of^responsibilities would prevail over the other more often than at-sent.   There are of course very many cases in which major conflicts9*1 ic interest are resolved within individual Departments.    Thisaanifestly true of many large departments, and the application of a2

CQNFIDEiNTLALprinciple that in every case of major conflict of public interest the conflicting aspects must be the responsibility of different ministers would lead to the break-up of the Ministry of Defence, the Departmentof Education and Science and a good many others.6, Secondly, in the Governments view the Select Committee &apos;s proposalrests on too ready an assumption about the ease with which the sectorresponsibility and the efficiency responsibility could be separatedinto self-contained compartments in practice.    For example,  theGovernment regard responsibility for a rational energy policy and responsibility for the investment programmes of the three nationalisedfuel industries, as well as for the efficiency of these industries,as inextricably linked.   The same would be true of transport policyand investment in railways and roads.1,  In neither energy nor transport is it possible to achieve the bestinvestment result in the national interest simply by attention tothe profitability or the investment programme of a single industry.It is essential to have regard to the effect of investment in oneindustry on the return on investment in others.    In having regard tothese effects, the responsible department is in fact concerningitself with a national energy or national transport policy.    If a &apos;Ministry for Nationalised Industries took account of these intereactions,both this department and the sector departments would, find themselvesworking on energy or transport policy, with resultant duplication andrisk of interdepartmental dispute.    If it did not, the sector depart-ments would need to concern themselves still more closely with investment programmes, with the same results.8. Another implication of separating the sector responsibility andthe efficiency responsibility is the division which this would producebetween responsibilities for public and private sector undertakings inthe same sector.    The Committee&apos;s proposal assumes a sharp distinctionbetween the type of responsibility exercised in the framework ofnational energy, transport or civil aviation policy, in relation tothe nationalised industries and the sponsorship function in relation to private sector undertakings in the same sector.    In practice a livelyinterest in the performance of, e.g., the privately-owned oil industry,or the private road haulage or civil aviation undertakings, is animportant e lement in sector responsibility;    and Government policy inrelation to these undertakings may afreet substantially their investmentan&amp; their prices.   For this reason the sector department must be con-cerned with all aspects or the economic health of both public and private undertakings in its sector.3

9, Thirdly, the Government are in no doubt that the sub-division of responsibilities in relation to each nationalised industry and thecreation of a Ministry of Nationalised Industries at arms length fromthe sector responsibilities would mean more work and more staff inDovernment and in the nationalised industries, which would each be concerned with two government departments.    Conflicts of public interestnow reconciled within a single department would have to be more formallydebated between two departments and on such issues both departmentsnight want recourse to the industries and to the central departments.The position of the Chairmen or nationalised industries with two depart-uents could become more difficult or equivocal.    The burden of informa-tion, or consul-cation and of co-ordination would be greater both inJovernment and in the industries.   While there would, be two departmentsinstead of one necessarily seeking information from each industry,there would be no single point in Government so well informed as atpresent about each industry and its relationship to sector policy andthe wider national interest.    It is true that in exchange there v/ouldgrow up in the Ministry of Nationalised Industries an expertise indealing with nationalised industries as such,   however, there is already in the Ministry of Power a considerable concentration of such expertise,since the business of the department is mainly with nationalised indus-tries.   (Reference is made in paragraph h.3 below to the development ofarrangements for interchange of staff to foster this type of expertise).In the circumstances the Government consider that the exchange whichwuld result from the Select Committee&apos;s proposal would not yield anet gain.10.  fourthly, the Government do not believe that the establishment ofa Ministry of Nationalised Industries responsible for the efficiency of those industries, but not for sector policy, would reduce interven-tion in the management of the industries, as the Select Committee hopeand expect.    It is not enough to say that the powers and responsibilities -ties of the proposed Minister should be no more than those recommended in the Select Committee&apos;s Report.   The promotion of efficiency couldx held to cover a wide range of existing statutory functions as wellas new matters.    If Parliament were invited to regard the new Minister^having the general efficiency of the industries as his main respon-sibiiity, they would tend to expect him to answer on many aspects of the k

management of the industries, especially in view of the powerspecorasended.   All the pressures of responsibility would be towardsgreater intervention.u,  The Government accept that there would be certain advantages in ahorizontal organisation, which treated nationalised industry as a function for itself.    It is natural and right that the Select Committeeon Nationalised Industries should see these advantages very clearly.The Government, however,  take the view that these gains would be greatly outweighed by losses if the price were the divorce of industryresponsibility from sector responsibility.    A department responsiblefor ail nationalised industries and all relevant sectors would be toodiverse and too large.    If the choice between the two methods of organisation has therefore to be made,  the Government consider that organisation by sectors is to be preferred.me role of departments12.  The Government believe that within the existing pattern of responsibilities the tasks of particular departments require further detailed study.    They therefore accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation(paragraph 5M.) that discussions should be held between the Treasury,the D.E.A.  and the departments to clarify their respective contributions to the control of investment.    Because of the importance of investment as a central feature of Ministerial control over the industries, theGovernment believe this to be a most important recommendation.13*  The Government accept the recommendation (paragraph 390 thatsponsoring departments should take the initiative in bringing together the industries for discussion of common problems.As the Committee themselves recognise this is already the practicen dealing with some types of problem;   but it is intended to extendlhese contacts with the industries as necessary.

ik,  The Committee drew attention to complaints by some industriesthat they had insufficient access to the Treasury, and recommended(paragraph 822) that in future, in cases where the final decisionrested with the Treasury, industries should have the right to state their case to the Treasury;    although the Committee also recognis ed(paragraph 82k)  that the Treasury was not a court of appeal against decisions of the responsible departments.    Government policies towardsthe industries are of course finally settled by Ministers collectively,not by olficials in individual departments.   But &quot;the Government agreethat it is right for the industries to have opportunities to meetcentral economic departments.The Committee suggested (paragraph 66U) that, in addition topresent statutory power to issue general directions, and to issuepecific directions upon particular subjects specified in the statutes,misters should also have a statutory power to issue formal directivesiipon any specific subject which appear to them to be in the national interest.As the Committee recognise, Ministers have in some cases powersissue specific directions upon particular subjects defined in the statutes.   If circumstances arose in future in which it seemedadvisable for a Minister to be able to deal with a particular subjectissuing specific formal directions, for which powers did not exist,ne Government wouid seek the necessary powers for the purpose.    Tonia extent, the Government accept the Committee&apos;s proposal;   butdo not propose to take general powers to issue specificfactions on any subject to the nationalised industries. Possession ofwide general powers would, in their view lead to heavier pressure1Iusters to interfere with the management of the industries ihan the Committee

Vforesee.   It would involve the creation of a new climate in which theindustries would be seen to be formally subject to Ministerial control on particular as well as general matters which touched the national interest.    This would in the Government&apos;s view inevitably lead over theears to a gradual encroachment by Ministers on the management respon-sibilities of the industries, so undermining their efficiency and reducing their capacity to recruit and keep capable top management.\j. The serious problems which arise in defining an elastic conceptsiich as the national interest would be accentuated if it becamepossible to issue directions on particular as well as general matters.And the fact that Ministers possessed the power of direction would inevitably require substantial additional staff effort over the wholefield in which the power could be exercised - even if in a substantial proportion of such cases it was decided not to exercise the power.Ms would not, in the Governments view be a worthwhile use of civilservice manpower.    The Government therefore prefer that Ministerialrelationships with the industries should be developed within the present statutory framework of control.    Within this framework practical conven-tions and usages have evolved which preserve an acceptable degree of autonomy for the industries while at the same time providing thenecessary degree of accountability to Parliament.jl8i As the Committee recommended (paragraph 681 ) the Government will^-examine the case for existing Ministerial pavers over the researchan3 training programmes of the industries and will propose in due^rse any amendments to the present statues that may be foundpessary.The Committee recommended      ( paragraph 867) that Ministers should publish periodic White Papers about the performance and prospects ofe industries for which they are responsible;    and   (paragraph 868)ptet these should serve as the vehicle for Government statements aboutpctoral policy, on the lii js of the 1967 White Papers about Fuelolicy and Railways Policy.    This recommendation is noted and will be

20, The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s general e ndorsement of thepolicy for pricing set out in Cmnd. 3h37*    The Committee has suggested-that this policy has not been laid down with sufficient clarity to beIunambiguous guide to the industries in making individual pricingdecisions.   The Government point out that the White Paper was intendedonly as a statement of general principles, in v/hich it was necessaryto set out a series of possible qualifications of the marginal costingprinciples.21. As explained in paragraph 3h of the White Paper,  the Governmentntend to elaborate these principles and qualifications as necessaryin working out, with the industries, individual pricing policies foriach industry.   The detailed application of these policies is for theindustries themselves.    It was explained in evidence that the Treasurydepartments concerned will be pursuing these questions with theindustries.j2. These discussions will in many cases be linked to the renegotiation[f financial objectives as these fall due for renewal.   These objectives,the pricing and investment criteria which they will reflect, willcourse be reported to Parliament by the responsible Ministers asAgreements are concluded.    This will,  the Government believe, meetne intention of the Committee&apos;s recommendation      (paragraphs 396 and^) that standard pricing policies should be laid down for each industry and published.1^&apos;       Committee recommended, in this connection (paragraph hi 7) thatlnisterial control over pricing policies should be given legislative action.iorne in mind, though the Government point out that much informationb0Ut performance and prospects already appears in the Annual Reportslfthe Boards which are laid before Parliament each year, and in thelCcasional White Papers which are laid when Borrowing Bills are beforeParliament.Pricing policies

;!), The Government do not accept this proposal, which would in theirv/ be likely to lead not only to undesirable interference in day-to-day,encouragement  but also to serious practical difficulties in its applicationto those industries which provide a wide variety of goods and services,&quot;lie pricing policies of the industries will, however, be considered by&quot;ministers in the course of the settlement of financial objectives and itDili, of course, be open to the Government to influence these policiesindirectly by the use of statutory directions on the level of reserves.25, As regards the Air Transport Licensing Board, which the Committeeimposed (paragraph 803) should be abolished, no decision will be takenpending the report of the Committee of Enquiry into Civil Air Transport.2b\ The Committee proposed (paragraph U09)  that within the pricingpolicies to be laid down by Ministers (whether statutorily or, for theiresent in most cases, extra-statutorily) industries should have aleasure of freedom to make changes in price without the need to seekMaterial approval.    The Government accept this proposal in principle;.ndus tries need,  and currently have, a measure of flexibility insetting individual prices (subject to the general prices and incomes?policy).   It would however be difficult to define the limits of thesewers in any precise way, and as the Committee recognises any suchlimits would need adjustment in the light of experience, vestment policies1&apos; The Committee agreed (Chapter V) with the policy laid down intana. 324.37, under which investment decisions are based upon discountedflow calculations and the use of a test discount &apos;rate derived fromtimated returns to investment in the private sector.    The

tee ai industry has a well-established and approved plan of development thereill in general be the less need for scrutiny of individual smallerprojects *   But an informed judgment on investment programmes as a wholeseldom attainable without some examination of major projects fromItime to time.    In some cases Ministerial approval of individual invest-lent decisions is required by specific statutory provisions, and it isjalso necessary in other cases where important social or economic consid-jrations are involvedT :. The Committee recognised the importance for investment decisions of&apos;orrect demand forecasting;    the Government accept the recommendation&quot;paragraph h55 that further studies of this subject should be initiative-sd to supplement the extensive work already undertaken in some indus-Pies.&apos;0, The Government also accept responsibility for issuing generalluidance to the industries about economic planning assumptions uponnich demand forecasting can be based (paragraph 581 );    the Governmentill keep the industries fully informed of their economic assumptions.1* But at the end of each annual investment review decisions have0Demade about the level of investment to be approved for eachndustry, towards the setting of which the investment criteria of Cmnd.^37 offer only partial guidance.   For this reason, a capitalZoning scheme of the kind proposed in paragraph 27k may not be the% way in which changes in investment programmes should be made.    Norould the development of such a scheme be free from practical andiovernment welcome this endorsement of their general policy towardsinvestment.    They accept the Committee&apos; s recommendation (paragraph 257)-bat periodic reviews should be made of the evidence available fromthe private sector.    Such a review is at present in process,jj, At the same time it must be appreciated that the investmentcriteria just referred to are not automatic, but depend on the skillaid capacity of management.   Within the general lines laid down for the[exercise of strategic control there remains a need for the Governmentscrutinise the overall level and pattern of investment, and in someliases, if their strategic control is to be effective and well-informed thelovernment may also need to scrutinise large individual investment projects

technical difficulties.   But the Government agree that an effort shouldbe made to devise a capital rationing system, for use when reductions in investment are needed to maintain the balance of the economy, whichwould distribute total cuts between the industries in the least harmfulWy, while leaving the industries the maximum practicable freedom to choose the items to be cancelled or postponed.    They propose to discuss this problem further with the industries.32,   The Committee proposed (paragraph 592) that cost-benefit studiesshould be made of all major projects proposed by the industries whichcould not be justified on commercial criteria alone, or which, whilecommercially profitable, imposed significant social costs upon thecommunity.    The Government announced their intention, in paragraph 1hof Cmnd. 3437* of taking externalities into account in appraisinginvestment projects.    Cost-benefit studies are, and will continue tobe, made wherever this seems desirable in order to reach an informeddecision.33.   The Committee proposed (paragraph 597) a further supplement to theexisting investment controls; comparing the actual outturn of projectswith the returns which were forecast when the investment was decided.It recommended that the Treasury should initiate discussions with Departments and industries about this proposal. In fact, interdepart-mental discussions of this topic had recently begun, based on informa-hon available about the techniques already in use in the industries.! These discussions have now been   extended to include the industries themselves.Social obligations%  In paragraph 282, and in greater detail in Chapter XIV of theReport, the &quot;Committee recommended that &quot;where extra social or widerPublic interest obligations are imposed on or undertaken by theindustries, they should be publicly identified, quantified andaPprop?iately financed by the Ministers concerned&quot;.    It will not always^practicable to identify or quantify such obligations precisely.11

t,0r, having done so, would it always be necessary or desirable to make special payments accordingly. Nevertheless, as indicated in paragraph37 of Cmnd. 3U37. where an industry is required to act against its owncommercial interests the Government will take responsibility and where appropriate, make a special payment to the industry or make an adjust-ment to its financial objective.Financial objectives35,   The Committee accepted (paragraph h83) the policy set out in theWhite Paper, under which financial objectives should become the financialexpression of the pricing and investment criteria already laid down.The Government are already working out the consequences of this policy for settling new financial objectives for the gas and electricity industries, and financial objectives for the other industries will fall to be fixed, or revised, from time to time.    In this process the views expressed by the Committee in paragraphs h85-U98 about the quantifica-tion and expression of objectives will be borne in mind.    To a consider-able extent these views reflect the Governments existing thinking onthese subjects as expressed in evidence to the Committee.36i  The Committee recommended      (paragraph 496) that objectivesshould be set for each of the fuel industries as a whole and not for individual Area Boards.    So long as the Area Boards enjoy financialautonomy under the statutes, the Minister concerned must formallysettle financial objectives with each of them.   Where, as in the gas industry and in the electricity industry in England and Wales, thereis a Council for the industry, the Minister will seek the advice of theCouncil before settling the individual objectives.SSEital stwintiifq and borrowing37*  The Government note the views expressed by the Committee in chapter XI, which in general accord with their own policy.    They acceptthe recommendation in paragraph 628 that the Treasury s hould initiate&quot;^es of the terms and conditions of the industries borrowing powers.They agree that the existence of public dividend capital should not be

llowed to obscure judgment of economic performance, but consider thisImpertinent in the form of capital structure to be worth making.;0sts and efficiency58, The Government note also the views expressed in Chapter XV, abouttfleworking of the National Board for Prices and Incomes (N.B.P.I.) inrelation to the nationalised industries and are glad to see that theCommittee regard the Reports so far published by the Board as useful.Experience so far is being carefully studied to see whether any changes should be made in the present practice for references to the Board.Ihe views of the Committee on possible changes in the existing practiceoutlined in the Prime Minister1 s statement of 7th September   1967 willJbe carefully studied, particularly in relation to longer term develop-lents.39- In paragraph 759 the Committee suggested that consideration shouldgiven to referring to the N.B.P.I.  the possibility of reductions inirices.   There is already of course provision for such references inthe present prices and incomes legislation, and the Government intend to keep under review the possibility of such references in suitable cases[in the public sector as well as in the private sector.* In paragraph 393 the Committee recommended that early warningft price increases should be given by the nationalised industries[irect to the Department of Employment and Productivity (D.E.P.).    Inact this would introduce a system for nationalised industries differentrom that applied in the private sector.   Early warnings of price&quot;creases by private firms are always given to the appropriate sponsoringePartment and are examined in the first place in that department before i^y are considered interdepartmentally.   This has the advantage thatlIie Proposals are examined by people familiar with the industry con-l^ed.   The Government believe that the advantages of this procedurePPiy equally in the public sector and that the nationalised industriesv^ld continue to be treated in the same way as private industry in^ respect.

k3,  The Committee recommended (paragraph 297)  that the whole problemof the selection of Board members should be studied by a body set up[for the purpose, including people with experience of selection ofpersons for senior management posts  in various sections of industry.The methods of selection for these appointments have been reviewed&apos;ith the departments responsible for nationalised industries and thehvil Service Department has also had a series of discussions withsome prominent management consultants and others versed in this matter.rhe present arrangements will be reviewed in the light of these dis-jcussions and the Government see no need to appoint a special body topquire further into the selection procedure at this stage.3&apos; -The Committee noted (paragraph 308) that the question of thejuries of Board members has been referred to the N.B.P.I.    The 3oardl^ejaow reported, recommending substantial increases.   The Government&apos; Yejmnounced that they are satisfied that the recommendations are&apos; JtJ;n principle and should be implemented-when the requirements of 11^es policy allow.    The Government have accordingly decided toI^H^gnt immediately the first instalment of the increases, leaving&apos; 1Uid,  In paragraph 6UU the Committee made a somewhat similar recommenda-tion that nationalised industries should deal directly with the D.E.P.in relation to proposals to increase wages and salaries.    The government believe that there are advantages in the present system by whichnationalised industries deal in the first place with their sponsoringdepartment on these matters.   But the suggested change will be con-sidered as a matter of interdepartmental organisation.    It should however be emphasised that there must inevitably be the closestcontact between the D.E.P.  and the sponsoring department in the handling of incomes policy in relation to nationalised industries andthe public sector generally.    The precise point of delivery of suchearly warnings  to the Government machine is not in practice a matterof great significance.Selection, pay, and conditions of service of Board Members

second and third instalments to be considered in the light oflopments in incomes policy over the next two years.nTPP.v management of deparmental staff including interchange with^Nationalised industries the Government accept the recommendation (paragraph 8L2)  that(hen considering the Fulton Report they should also consider theridence given to the Committee on the arrangements for staffing thoseivisions of the sponsoring departments which deal with nationalisedndustries.   The conclusions of the Committee are closely related tohe points considered in Chapter 2 of the Fulton Report, which areeing examined in detail by the Civil Service Department in consultationith other departments, including those responsible for the nationalisedndustries.15
