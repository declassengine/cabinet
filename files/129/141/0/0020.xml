HISTORICAL background.      For many years the cause oi unrest has been the well documentedaccusation that the ruling Protestant majority has maintained power bydiscriminating against the Roman Catholic minority.    Captain CHeill,during his tenure of office, made genuine efforts, which showed everysign of promise, to remove sectarian bitterness hi the Province arisingfrom feelings of injustice on the one side and, on the other, fear ofabsorption into a united Ireland, and did much to improve relationswith the Republic of Ireland.    His policy v/as initially directed atremoving communal bitterness rather than at reform in the fieldswhere the specific complaints of injustice lay.    So changes in thelocal government franchise, the gerrymandering of ward boundariesand discrimination in the allocation of local authority houses, and inemployment and public appointments were slow to come.    As a resultsocial discontent remained, fostered by economic weakness, and high unemployment.3.       These discontents came to a head when the recently formedCivil Rights Association resorted to militant pressure for reform.After a little publicised demonstration in Dungannon in August, 1968,.the Association staged a demonstration in Londonderry on 5th october last.    Demonstrations, often accompanied by violence, then became a commonplace.

4,       Immediately after the demonstration of 5th October, arrangements were made for a meeting between the Prime Minister and myself and thePrime Minister of Northern Ireland, his deputy and Minister of Commerce(Mr. Faulkner) and the Minister of Home Affairs (Mr. Craig).    Thismeeting was hold on 4th November.    The discussions that day covered the following particular topics which the Prime Minister and I putforward:-(i) The local government franchise,(ii) The allocation of housing,(iii) The disturbances in Londonderry.(iv) The Special Powers Acts.(v)  The appointment of a Parliamentary Commissioner for administration in Northern Ireland.After allowing time for further discussions on either side, the PrimeMinister on 19th November wrote to Captain CNeill reiterating theviews of Her Majesty&apos;s Government as expressed at the meeting, and requiring specific pledges of action in the field of local governmentfranchise and housing.    Captain 0&apos;Neill was warned that, if action was not forthcoming, Her Majestyls Government would have to considerlegislation in these fields at Westminster and to re-examine thefinancial arrangements between the two Governments^5.      On 22nd November, the Northern Ireland Government declaredits intention to provide for:-(i)  The appointment of a Development Commission for Londonderryto carry out the Londonderry Area Plan, to improve bothemployment prospects and housing,(ii) The adoption of fair methods of housing allocation.(iii) The appointment of a Parliamentary Commissioner for administration.(iv) The abolition of the company vote in local government elections,(v) A review of the Special Powers legislation.They gave no indication of reform of the local government franchise inadvance of more general reforms of the structure and functions of localgovernment that were under consideration,-2-

6.       In December the Minister of Home Affairs (Mr. Craig), who had clearly shown himself to be unsympathetic to reform, was dismissed by captain OsNeill.    In January, the Northern Ireland Government decidedto appoint an independent Commission to inquire into tho eventsaccompanying the disturbances since 5th October and their underlyingcauses.    This Commission, headed by lord Cameron, is now at work,but its appointment led to the resignations of the Minister of Commerce(Mr. Faulkner) and the Minister of Health and Social Services.    Despitean earlier broadcast appeal for moderation by Captain OfNeill, whichbrought a remarkable wave of support from tho public, Captain 0&apos;Neill&apos;position in the Party was steadily eroded, with further resignations fromhis Government and the defection of some of his back-bench supportersto a group bitterly hostile to him personally, and (apparently) to the policy for which he stood.    Captain 0&apos;Neill decided on a General Election, which took place on 24th February.    It was Captain 0&apos;Neillls hope that theElection would unite the great bulk of Protestants and Catholics of moderate opinion who would unite in support of his policies and returna Unionist Party devoted to the achievement of reforms aimed at unitingthe two communities.    This hope was not fulfilled; I said at the time thatI feared Captain 0&apos;Neill was mistaking the articulat and rather middle-class support he received for a real shift in grass roots of opinion and soit turned out.     Marginally Captain 0!Neill!s position was improved, butthe dissident wing of the Unionist Party remained strongly entrenched.B.    CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION7.       During the weeks which followed the General Election,Captain 0&apos;NeilI&apos;s authority in the Unionist Party gradually deteriorated.He was able to secure the Parliamentary Unionist Party&apos;s acceptance ofthe principle of universal adult suffrage in local government elections ata meeting on 22nd April, but when he saw that the hard-line Unionists inthe Party at large were determined to resist reform, he felt that he could not longer reconcile the two wings of the Party and that another leadercoming fresh to the situation would have a better chance.Major Chichester-Clark resigned on 23rd April on the grounds thatthe timing of the decision on the local government franchise wouldgive rise to disorder;  on 28th April Captain 0&apos;Neill decided to give up the leadership of the Party and to resign as Prime Minister as soonas a new leader was elected.8.       The choice of a successor lay between-Mr. Brian Faulkner and major Chichester-Clark,    Major Chichester-Clark, who had beenMinister of Agriculture for two years before he resigned on 23rd April,was elected by 17 votes to 16 - a vote later made unanimous - and accepted the Governor&apos;s invitation to form a Government on 1st May.He has formed an Administration which attempts to bridge the gap between the tv/o wings of the Party,    Mr. Faulkner has been madeMinister of Development and three of his supporters (who were opposedto Captain 0&apos;Neill) junior Ministers,

9.       Major ChicheGter-Clark&apos;s general outlook is &quot;liberal&quot; (in aNorthern Ireland context) but he is likely to approve of strong measuresto prevent disorder,,    He is likely to be a little more acceptable to thecivil rights movement than Mr. Faulkner and correspondingly a little less acceptable to the extreme Paisleyite faction,,    We do not know how long he will be able to survive, but he has reassured me personally thathe will not go back on the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;,    I have senthim a message expressing congratulations and good will, and he hasreplied assuring us of Mb commitment to tackle his tasks with a determination to restore peace, to demonstrate evident fairnessto all and to resume the course of social and economic progress.10.      I made the following points to hirn in a telephone conversationon 5th May I(a) That our policy is founded on the belief that we shall get thebest solution if Northern Ireland can handle its own problems,(b) That the new Government needs to pursue reforming policies.(c) That public opinion in Great Britain demands standards inNorthern Ireland equal to those in the rest of the UnitedKingdom,(d) That the Northern Ireland Government could not expect Britishtroops to be made available to deal with, disorder without callinginto question the constitutional relationships and bringing aboutthe possibility of total intervention, a course which HerMajestyls Government would adopt only as a last resort.Major Chichester-Clark appeared to accept all these points,]1.       We must await details of the new Prime minister&apos;s programme.He is committed to reform of the franchise, but at what pace we do not know.    As regards the reforms announced on 22nd November (seeparagraph 5 above), the Londonderry Commission has been appointed,the local authorities have been asked for their views on new methods of housing allocation, a Bill to establish a Parliamentary Commissioner isbefore Stormont, and the company vote in local elections has alreadybeen abolished,12,       The Civil Eights Association has so far shown no changedreaction to Major Chichester-Clarkrs election.    The movementcontains a mixture of elements.    Some have as their only purpose the overthrow of any established Government,    Others seek definitereforms,- mainly:(a) The repeal of the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act,(b) An end to religious discrimination in employment and housing.

(c) An end to gerrymandering.(d) The extension of the Race Relations Act to Northern Ireland.(e) The abandonment cf the Northern Ireland Public Order Bill.(f) One man, one vote,13,      It is reported that the civil rights movement is planning a programme of civil disobedience to take place throughout NorthernIreland and probably to start at once,,    Apart from picketing public buildings, the plan appears to be to hold unofficial elections in areas where Unionist councils hold office in predominantly Roman Catholicareas, and purport to carry out local government functions there,14.       The Government of the Irish Republic has naturally taken a close interest in recent events in Northern Ireland.    The ForeignMinister, Mr, Aiken, flew to New York on 22nd April to report thesituation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, but he didnot seak to initiate any formal action in the United Nations.     TheTaoiseach, Mr. Lynch, has asked for a meeting with the PrimeMinister but the Prime Minister has said that he cannot meet himuntil he has met the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,    TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary has arranged to meet Mr. Aikenon 6th May when he will be in London for the Council of Europe meeting.These moves by the Government of the Irish Republic are directedprimarily towards satisfying their own public opinion and pressure from the Irish Republican lobby in the United States, and it is thoughtthat they are anxious not to take any action which could aggravate thesituation.Cf    PUBLIC ORDER15.      Since the early demonstrations in August and October, the pattern of demonstrations has been the clash of opposing factions.Civil rights demonstrations have brought into militant action extremeProtestant organisations headed by the Reverend. Ian Paisley and major Bunting,    The clash between thern is the cause of the violencewhich has accompanied the series of demonstrations that has proceededthroughout the last seven months.    The Royal Ulster Constabulary havealienated the sympathies of the Roman Catholic community, whether thisis a fair judgment of their actions or not0    Ugly scenes have occurred ona number of occasions in Londonderry and in other towns, such as Armaghand Newry, but the most serious occurrence and that having the mostlasting effect was the People&apos;s Democracy march from Belfast toLondonderry from 1st to 4th January.    This march broke the truceto demonstrations declared by the Civil Rights Association afterCaptain CNeil^s broadcast before Christmas.    It had the effectof arousing bitter hatred in local communities lying on the line ofmarch,

16.       During the weekend 19th-20th April, following an earlier explosionat an electricity installation, there were two major incidents of sabotage:an explosion directed against the Belfast water supply and the explosion of an electricity pylon.    In addition a number of fire bombs were thrownat post offices in Belfast.    The explosions led to a request from theGovernment of Northern Ireland for troops to be made available toguard certain key installations, mostly connected with water or electricity supplies and all in remote areas.    The United Kingdom Government agreedto this request and troops took up their positions on 21st April.    Afurther explosion directed against the Belfast water supply took placeon 24th April: following this explosion the Northern Ireland Governmentasked for further installations to be guarded by the military and theUnited Kingdom Government sent an additional infantry battalion anda party of Royal Engineers to Northern Ireland to reinforce the troopsalready there.D.    USE OF TROOPS17.       The legal position is that in Northern Ireland, as in great britain, the military, like other citizens, are at common lav/ boundto assist the civil authorities in the enforcement of law and order ifcalled upon to do so and may use such force as is reasonable in thocircumstances.    In the case of the military, who have special meansof force at their disposal, it is the responsibility of the military commander to decide what force, if any, is necessary to deal withthe particular situation.18.       The reservation to the United Kingdom Parliament and government of the control of the armed forces in Northern Irelanddoes not affect the common law duty of tho military,    Nevertheless theNorthern Ireland Government accept as a governing principle that before any request for assistance is made there must be consultationat Government to Government level;  and machinery has been set upto enable decisions to be speedily taken by Ministers if any such requestis received,,    On Monday, 5th May, Major Chichester-Claik informed me in our telephone conversation that he fully understood and acceptedthe understanding to consult with me before requesting the use ofmilitary force.    It is conceivable, although unlikely, that a situation might arise of such urgency as to preclude consultation through this machinery.    The General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland hasbeen instructed that any request received for military assistance should,if humanly possible, be referred to the Ministry of Defence in London;but in the la3t resort the military commander v/ould still have theresponsibility of acting on his own discretion.

19.      I took the opportunity to tell Captain 0&apos;Neill earlier in the yearthat, if recourse had to be had to the military to deal with disorder,this would create a completely new situation and that we should be bound to look most carefully at the implications and indeed to re-examineour whole constitutional relationships.    He so informed his Cabinet atthe time,    A short time ago I reminded the Northern Ireland Governmentthat if troops needed to be used to maintain order we should be bound tokeep the implications of any such commitment under consideration;  andI have similarly informed the new Prime Minister who understands thatthis will be so,20.      When on Sunday, 20th April, we agreed that troops should be madeavailable to guard key installations, it was made clear to the NorthernIreland Government that this agieement was strictly limited in scope;and they accepted that they would nave to make a fresh request if thoywanted the help of troops for any other purpose,21.       On 25th April there was a suggestion, emanating not from theNorthern Ireland Government but from the Inspector -General of theRoyal Ulster Constabulary, that a request might be made for the useof troops to support the police in patrols in border areas, following information obtained by the Royal Ulster Constabulary that the irish republican Army (IRA) were planning border raids.     Troops were used for this purpose in 1956-62 - this is-the only recent instanceof the use of troops in Northern Ireland - and it has always been regarded by the Garrison as a normal part of its task.    But norequest has yet been received from the Northern Ireland Governmentto this effect.    If a request were made, we should need to consider thecircumstances.    But even if acceded to, it would still fall far short ofthe use of troops to assist in dealing with disorder,22.      At the beginning of the year, a contingency plan was drawn up.This consisted of a number of hypothetical situations, showing thepossible political and military reaction to each situation;  a draftBill, to provide against the contingency under which Her Majesty&apos;government in the United Kingdom would assume direct responsibilityfor Northern Ireland and administer it through the Governor;  and supporting documents of the kind likely to be needed immediately on the onset of an emergency.    Arrangements to co-ordinateintelligence have been put in hand.23.      Some of the situations envisaged in tho contingency plan have changed since planning hypotheses were drawn up.    In presentcircumstances, one could envisage the following various possibilities

(a) There might be sporadic disturbances of a relatively minorcharacter, arising from demonstrations by Civil Rights members or Paisleyites, or just sheer hooliganism.    These would be minorin the sense that no loss of life or serious damage to property was involved.    The realisation by the Government of Northern Irelandthat compliance with the request for the use of troops might lead towider intervention would strongly inhibit them from asking formilitary assistance, and indeed it is to be expected that in thekind of situation envisaged, the police would be able to containdisorder (though v/ith a good deal of recrimination and with thepolitical risk of having to use the &apos;B! Specials if the regular policewere unduly stretched).(b) Localised disorder of the kind envisaged in (a) might increase to the point where firearms were used or life and property otherwisein serious danger, and the regular police would be unable to cope.Whether our accession to a request for military assistance in this case would lead to our taking steps to assume direct rule would depend on the circumstances.    If the facts plainly justified it andif the disorder was not primarily political, the use of military force to deal with localised disorder might be accepted by public opinion asproper;  and total intervention might not necessarily have to follow.If, however, the process were multiplied, political intervention wouldbecome more likely,(c) If grave disorder of the kind described in (b) above were not confined to one locality, but became widespread so that a number of serious riots took place at different places at the same time, the policemight not be able to concentrate a sufficient force to handle all of thornand military assistance might be called for in more than one area.The multiplication of instances would not affect our duty to make troops available to protect life and property, but it would almost certainly leadto a reappraisal of constitutional relationships and probably to theintroduction of the draft Bill providing for the assumption of direct control of Northern Ireland by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(d) If the disorder became so grave and v/idespread as to amountto a general breakdown of law and order, I see no escape from our having to support military intervention with full political intervention.The Bill would be passed and we should endeavour to rule NorthernIreland from Y/westminster,    Outline plans have been prepared to enable us to do so.    The initial plans do not envisage anything approachingmilitary rule.     One cannot, however, entirely exclude the possibility that, despite the introduction of direct rule from Westminster, weshould have to deal v/ith continued disorder amounting to insurrection.In this event, v/e might have to consider assuming extreme powers:special powers of arrest and search, and the assumption by theGeneral Officer Commanding of direct responsibility for maintainingorder including power to try civilians by court martial.-8-

24.      It might be argued that we should in no circumstances allow the armed forces to be used to maintain order in Northern Ireland.;  that inso far as it might be objected that the common law obliged the militaryto assist in the maintenance of order, we should withdraw our garrisonfrom Northern Ireland.    I do not myself believe that this is a realisticappraisal.    It seems to me that if we had withdrawn troops, and lawand order then broke down, we could not resist demands to send themback; and that we should be failing in our duty if we allowed blood to bespilt0 the minority groups persecuted and buildings sacked while standingon the principle that we would not allow troops to be used.    Moreover,the Northern Ireland garrison is part of the United Kingdom strategic reserve.    Its raison d*etre is not the maintenance of order in theProvince.    The view of the Secretary of State for Defence is that itswithdrawal would have considerable strategic and logisticalimplications of a general character and would also leave unguarded theonly land frontier of the United Kingdom.    The Northern ireland government will be left in no doubt that we do not Intend to make troops available to support any policy they may choose to follow irrespective ofits consequences.    But if, regrettably, it should ever come to the point,I cannot see any escape from the conclusion that there are circumstances in which troops will have to be committed and that this will lead to totalintervention by us.E.    COURSES NOW OPEN25.      At the two extremes lie the possibilities of declaring NorthernIreland to be independent of the United Kingdom and on the other hand ofruling Northern Ireland directly from Westminster.    The implications of independence, in effect expulsion of Northern Ireland from the UnitedKingdom were considered by officials, whose report is attached at annex A.    In my view it cannot be considered as a practical possibility;even if we could unilaterally change the national status of NorthernIreland, we should be abandoning the minority we are desiring to protect.Intervention by way of direct rule from Westminster might be forced upon us, particularly if the troops were committed to dealing v/ithdisorder, but I am sure that it is not a course which we should consideradopting out of choice.    Partial intervention, for example by legislation at Westminster to bring into the reserved field topics hitherto in the transferred field, might well lead to total intervention;  if the enactmentat Westminster of a particular reform in Northern Ireland causedviolence on the streets there, v/e could hardly disclaim responsibilityfor the maintenance of law and order.26.      The question of the restriction or denial of funds to the NorthernIreland Exchequer is considered in detail in Annex B.    It is hard to escape the conclusion that financial sanctions would be ineffective as a deterrent or stimulus to the Northern Ireland Government-, who couldconvincingly represent that they v/e re hitting the minority v/e were trying to protect.    If any adjustment were contemplated in the method of allocating to Northern Ireland their share of taxes, it would be prudent to obtain the view of the Law Officers on its legality.-9-

27.      My present view is that the cardinal aim of our policy must beto influence Northern Ireland to solve its own problems;  to set as the objective the restoration of tranquillity and confidence and the securingof standards of social and civic justice in Northern Ireland equal to thosein the rest of the United Kingdom; and encourage the Northern ireland government in steps it takes towards these objectives and persuade itin that direction,28.      Political thought in Northern Ireland since its inception has been divided between those who work for a united Ireland and those who refuseto be severed from the United Kingdom,    The hard Unionist line Isengendered by fear of the minority.    If the minority could be persuaded to subscribe to the constitution of Northern Ireland and work towards itsprosperity, some part of this fear would be removed although the UlsterUnionists would still want to cling to office.    We should encourage as faras we can participation by Roman Catholics in the institutions ofGovernment at every level from which in some cases they have been deliberately excluded and in others from which they have deliberatelyexcluded themselves.    For instance, I would like to see a drive to recruit Roman Catholics into the regular ranks of the Royal ulster constabulary v/here theoretically one third of the establishment is set aside for Roman Catholics.29.      The Cabinet will observe that in the previous paragraph I havebeen underlining our existing policy that partition cannot be ended withoutthe consent of the people of Northern Ireland.    It is my view that a unitedIreland will be achieved only when North and South themselves voluntarilycome together.    And further, that this will not happen until the NorthernIreland Government are able to treat with the South from a positionrepresenting a united Province.    That lies in the distant future.30.      The immediate need is to restore confidence.    It may be that thenew government will succeed.    If it does not show signs of doing so, itis for us to take whatever steps we can to encourage reconciliation.This is the purpose of my proposal that we should have in reserve thepossibility of a Round-Table Conference of Northern Irish political leaders under United Kingdom Government chairmanship.    The proposals is more fully dealt with in Annex C.31.      As an immediate step I have arranged an early meeting withMajor Chichester-Clark probably on 15th May.    At this meeting we shallprobe his short term intentions and see how our own view and his of thelong term objectives coincide.32.      I also propose that we should secure the maximum support fromthe Opposition as well as our own back benches for our objectives and themeans of attaining them.- *L. j.

Annex BWithdrawal of United. Kingdom Subventionsto Northern IrelandThis paper examines the extent to which it might be possibleto withdraw the United Kingdom subventions to Northern Ireland and what the effects of such a decision might be0     Such a measure hasbeen considered as a means of exerting pressure on a reactionarygovernment in Northern Ireland;    it has not been contemplated in a situation where pressure was being placed on a moderate governmentto persuade it to be more liberal.     The payments which can beconsidered in this context are the (i) &apos; residuary share&apos; of reserved,taxation;    (ii)  special payments made under a variety ofenactments;    (iii) agriculture deficiency payments;    and(iv) capital loans.The &apos; residuary share1  of reserved taxationIncome tax and certain other taxes and duties are reserved tothe United Kingdom, and payable in Northern Ireland at ratesapplying to the United Kingdom as a whole.     The &apos;residuary share&apos;of reserved taxes paid into the Northern Ireland Exchequer underthe Government of Ireland Act 1920 consists of the proportion ofUnited Kingdom taxes which is properly attributable to NorthernIreland, after deduction of about  2 million as an imperial contribution (i.e. a contribution towards Defence and overseasexpenditurej etc.).     It currently amounts to about  200 million a year.The precise amount of the residuary share is determinedannually by consultation between the Treasury and the Ministry ofFinance, and formally by the statutory Joint Exchequer Board, onwhich the two Departments are represented under an&apos; independent chairman.     The Joint Exchequer Board could not easily bemanipulated to sanction even a modest reduction, in the residuaryshare;    and if it did so, there is statutory provision for appeals from its decisions.     Any substantial reduction would mean a radicaldeparture from the accepted, and long-standing practiee forinterpreting the provisions in the 1920 Act for calculating theresiduary share;    it is at least questionable whether this could beintroduced without amending the legislation itself.Special PaymentsA number of special payments are made to supplement theresiduary share and thus,enable Northern Ireland to enjoy &quot;parity of services&apos; with Great Britain.     The special payments, and their current annual costs, are:-(i)   payments under the Social Services (Northern Ireland.. Agreement) Act 13k9 - about  19 million;(ii)&quot; National Insurance Joint Authority payments made to theNorthern Ireland National Insurance Fund under section 63of the National Insurance Act 192+6 - about  13 million;1

(iii)    regional employment premium - about  9 million;(iv)   payments under section 32 of the Agriculture Act 1957(&apos;remoteness&apos; grants) - ahout  1.7 million;(v)    agriculture deficiency payments - about  28 million.Neither the Social Services nor the Insurance payments ((i)and (ii) above) could be suspended or reduced without legislation.But the provisions for the R.E.P. payments (iii) made uncler theFinance Act 1967 are discretionary in form;    and &quot;remoteness&apos;grants (iv) might also so be regarded.Agriculture deficiency payments (v) are made to farmers inNorthern Ireland, but they are part of the system which applies tothe United Kingdom as a whole and the Ministry of Agriculture inNorthern Ireland acts simply as the agent of the Government of theUnited Kingdom.     Technically the Ministry of Agriculture haspowers to differentiate between different regions but in practice the scope for using these powers to differentiate against farmers in Northern Ireland seems limited.Capital LoansCapital loans are made under section^ .oT the MiscellaneousFinancial Provisions Act 1950 and enable the Northern ireland government to lend investment capital to local authorities andpublic utilities.     They are discretionary and could be stoppedwithout legislation more or less at any time.     The current statutory limit of  120 million has nearly been reached and the 1969 finance bill will provide for it to be increased to  170 million.Possible courses oj^action the possibilities of taking action without legisla ion seemvery limited.     The main possibility would be to discontinueCapital loans.     The immediate effect would be some disruption5 Q?the capital programmes which these loans finance - i,e, the programmes of local authorities (including housing) and of theElectricity Board - and the principal value would probably be asa gesture and as a warning that more stringent measures might betaken if the Government of Northern Ireland did not respond.     Itwould also seem possible to reduce the &apos; remoteness&apos;  grants andR.E.P. payments.     The effects would not however be great andwould take some time to be felt.If there were a decision to introduce legislation it would bepossible to make a much larger reduction in United Kingdomsubventions.     Any legislation would be extremely controversial and it would be necessary to consider very carefully whichparticular payments should be reduced.     Thus, there would be a problem in equity over denying Northern Ireland the -share ofUnited Kingdom taxation which is properly attributable to them.But the -residuary share of reserved taxation might be reduced by increasing the deduction for the Imperial Contribution so that it more nearly represented a proportionate contribution towardsDefence and other Imperial expenditure.     Alternatively, thereduction might be effected on the special payments which are more clearly subsidies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.     TheToe 2

Top  SECRET; difficulty here is that these payments are related to the needsof the more vulnerable members of the community in Northern:- Ireland - those receiving social services benefits, workers in industry and farmers - and, in the case of agriculture deficiency round, would mean a direct reduction in the actual payments to; farmers.Any large reduction would effectively reduce..public expenditure in Northern Ireland and involve a departure from theprinciple of &quot;parity of services&apos; between Northern Ireland and; Great Britain which was introduced by the Simon Declaration ofj 12th May, 1938.     Moreover, whatever the form of the reduction inUnited Kingdom subventions, a reactionary government in NorthernIreland could apply reductions to vulnerable sections of thecommunity and place the blame on the government of the UnitedKingdom.More generally the effect on the economy of Northern Ireland,I including the loss of confidence, could do irretrievable damage tothe province and increase the political and social problems whichcan be finally resolved only in conditions of economic prosperity.Finally, if military intervention became necessary (and financialpressure might help to make it necessary) the task of the troops would be rendered more difficult if they were seen by the local population as the agents of a government which had caused themunnecessary suffering and hardship.ConclusionsLegislation would be necessary if financial pressure wereto have any substantial immediate effect except as a warning toI a reactionary government.     The legislation would be extremely\ controversial; the reduction of United Kingdom subventions wouldforce a departure from the principle of parity of services;    and: it could inflict serious damage on the economy of Northern; Ireland.3&quot;ToP SECRET

Annex CRound. Table conference a round table conference, representing different politicalopinions in Northern Ireland, might achieve the object of reconciliation where the Parliament of Northern Irelandcannot.     Exposure to political opinion in Great Britainmight have a salutary effect on the inbred and polarisedpolitical thought of Northern Ireland.     Conversely, thesituation could be benefited by a greater public understand-ing of Northern Ireland problems here.     At best a roundtable conference might create a climate for reconcilation;at worst it could postpone the day when total interventionmight be forced on us and would demonstrate that interventionhad been adopted only as a last resort.Scope of conference.   There are, however  a number of problems.     Unlike theIrish Round Table Conference of 191h9 and the 1930-31 Indiaand the 1955 Malta Conferences, a Round Table Conference on northern Ireland would essentially be dealing with matters that the United Kingdom Parliament has already delegated toanother Parliament and Governments and the issues would be primarily social and political.     The Conference would beperforming a task which Parliament at Stormont ought to beperforming, but cannot now convincingly perform.      If theNorthern Ireland Government would not take the initiative in asking H.M.G. to sponsor such a conference it might provehard to impose it on them and there is a risk that theconference might be boycotted.Membe rship3.   Apart from the United Kingdom Government element, themain membership would have to be centred on the membership of the Parliament of Northern Ireland;    but this raises anumber of problems.     First, there is no coherent opposition party at Stormont.     There are Northern Ireland Labour,Republican, Nationalist and Civil Rights members.     Each shadeof opinion at Stormont would no doubt have to be represented,but it might be asserted that even then one would have to gooutside Stormont for a complete spectrum.     On the other wing,there are reactionary Unionists at Stormont, but Mr. Paisleymight see a lack of symmetry in any conference that excludedhim;   and he might be right.     If the membership wentsubstantially wider than Stormont, the Irish RepublicanGovernment might claim places.    -But in my view this couldnot be allowed.     It would in any event render the proposaltotally unacceptable to most Unionists.     But a hostileRepublic is an enemy to progress.Tfcf

&quot;To &quot;SECRETh.   Since Lord Cameron&apos;s Commission was set up to examinethe events since October 1 968 and their underlying causes and has begun work, it would be useful if Lord Cameron were a member of the conference 0Eerms, of gefpi^erice5.    In drawing the terms of reference, it is for consideration whether it is realistic to ask for positive recommendations;probably it is not.      I would envisage the Conference sitting in private in London.The ^Outcome6.    If the proposal -were put to the Northern ireland government they would want to know how it was contemplated that effect should be given to anything that emerged.     Itis not realistic to suppose that the result would even approacha set of agreed recommendations, whether they were asked for or not;   the most that could be hoped for is some lowestcommon denominators which might point the way to progress.The question is whether it would be left to the NorthernIreland Government to take up and give effect to such resultsas emerged (on the assumption that they were in their field)or v/hether the United Kingdom Parliament would be asked topass any necessary legislation ordinarily within the transferred field.     The answer to this question might affect the readiness to co-operate of others besides theNorthern Ireland Government.     Probably all that could be saidat this stage is that the possibility of Westminsterlegislation is not wholly excluded - it could even be a matter for discussion at the conference - but that one would attemptto apply the ordinary processes in the first instance,     Apossible outcome would be legislation at &quot;Westminster, not directly regulating particular topics in Northern Ireland,but establishing a &apos; Bill of Rights&apos;, in extension of theexisting anti-discrimination provisions of the Government ofIreland Act 1920.2 5*CRET
