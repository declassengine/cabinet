The 40 per cent rate has been successful in attracting manylarge projects, even though capital intensive ones in some cases, tothe development areas.     Public and political opinion believe it to bethe most successful of all our development area incentives, and thereduction by 5 per cent will be ill-received - especially coming two days after we have published figures showing that in the most recent quarterthe development areas have received their lowest proportion of buildingapprovals since 1966.3.      Moreover, an announcement of a reduction next year in thedevelopment area rate of grant, coming so soon after the reversionfrom 45 per cent to 40 per cent this year, is hard to reconcile with the stability of the scheme, on which its incentive value largely rests.Although in itself 35 per cent might be an adequate incentive, this impression of instability may well prejudice further valuable develop-ments of an import-saving character.4.      This impression might also lead firm6 to press for guaranteesabout future rates of investment grant in development areas in respectof specific projects;  it is doubtful whether we have the necessary powers to do this.5.      A reduction in the rate would also cause acute difficulties in thecase of the aluminium smelters, particularly Alcan,    In the case of all three companies, the question of the stability of the rate of grant was raised by their representatives in discussions la6t July, and in agree-ment with the Treasury letters were sent to each company saying that,whilst the Government could not give special rates of grant to individual companies, nor bind themselves or their successors tomaintain investment grant in general at a particular level until the projects were completed, it had been the normal practice, when aconsiderable change was made which might have an adverse effect on individual cases, to make suitable transitional arrangements.

case of Alcan, the company were told that we would take account of the&quot;single project&quot; character of their smelter insofar as this might be relevant.    Since the majority of eligible expenditure on the second stage of this project will fall in 1973, any transitional arrangements to cover it would have to spread over a considerable period,,     the detailed effect of a reduction to 35 per cent from 1st April, 1970on the smelter projects is set out as an annex.6,      For all these reasons, if the Cabinet agree to a  reductionin the rate of grant, I am clear that there must be transitional arrangements to provide for continuance of the higher rate on projectsundertaken in the expectation of that rate.     These arrangements should cover not only the really large long scale projects such as the aluminium smelters, oil refineries etc. , but also for exampleengineering works some of which cannot be completed in one year,and which are of great assistance in providing employment in thedevelopment areas.    A lower i&amp;mit of the order of  100,000 totalexpenditure would probably cater for most projects where theexpenditure is likely to run beyond a year.   I am advised that selectivetransitional provisions of this kind could be included in an Orderreducing the rate.    Tomorrow^ statement should also include a broadreference to transitional arrangements.7.      For the same reasons, the longest possible period of noticeof the change should be given.     I must ask my colleagues therefore to agree that the date from which the reduction is to operate should be1st July, 1970, rather than 1st April.8.      If the Cabinet cannot agree on these points, I suggest that the precise source of savings should not be made clear in tomorrow^statement in the House.C. A. R. C.Board of Trade, S.W.1,23rd April, 1969-2

ANKEXAluminium SmeltersEffect ^Expenditure on the aluminium smelters now under construction(B.A.Co., A.A.M. amd Alcan first stage) will reach its peak during 1970and any reduction during that year on the rate of investment grantswill therefore &quot;be significant.   On the basis of information providedby the companies about the likely timing of expenditure, we estimate that the effect of a reduction to 35 per cent from 1st April 1970 will bo -Ji lP3 y                         Anticipated Grant Reduction&quot;Tat 4PlT&apos;A.A.M.                                 13.0 m.  833,000B.A.Co.                           .     11.8 n.  1,000,000Alcan first stage                 5.6 m.  364,000Alcan second stage                L.8 m.  690,0002.     If the reduction dated from 1st July 1970, the reduction in eachcase would be lessened, but this would not affect the Alcan second stage.The majority of eligible expenditure on this part of their smelter falls in 1973-    In these circumstances the company might either abandon thesecond stage, delay it at a substantial cost in import saving or seek tobring forward its timing.   Bringing it forward would load to difficultiesin EFTA which would counterbalance any advantage we might gain in theAssociation from the reduction in the rate of grant.3.     The effect upon AAM and BACo. may be that they would seek a postponemerof their repayments under the loans as these are timed to commence ineach case in periods during which the companies&apos; cash flows would be augmented by investment grants.
