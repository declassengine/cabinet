It is not a short statementbut the Hunt report and our proposals affect much of tho country andwe must make clear to industry what our package entails.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, 3.

Hunt Reppjrt:.......GoverrimentStatementWith permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make atstatement on the Report of the Committee on the IntermediateAreas under the Chairmanship of Sir Joseph Hunt which is being published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office,The Committee was appointed in September 1967 and SirJoseph Hunt and his colleagues have prepared a very full reporton a subject of great complexity.    The Government warmlyappreciate the Committee&apos;s work which included considerationof more than 300 written submissions, discussions with over130 organisations and firms and many visits throughout thecountry.Its principal conclusions and recommendations are asfollows: -(i)    The whole of the Yorkshire and Humberside and theNorth West Regions should qualify for a new 25 percent building grant and for training grants and direct training assistance on the same basis as that now available in the development areas,(ii)    In selected growth zones within these Regions thereshould also be Government estates and factory buildingwith supporting-investment including link roads,(iii)   For these two Regions and in the Notts./Derby and north Staffordshire planning sub-divisions thereshould be an 85 per.cent grant for derelict landclearance as in the development areas.    The clearanceprogramme should be speeded up in all these areas andin the development areas.(iv) -The industrial development certificate control should&quot;be relaxed throughout the country with the exemptionlimit raised,  to 10,000 square feet./(v)1.

(v)    The Merseyside development area should &quot;bede-scheduled and treated on the same &quot;basis asthe rest of the North West Region,pour members in three Notes of Dissent have expressed reservations about some of the Committee&apos;s findings.The Government have considered these recommendations againstthe background of our assessment of general economic prospects forthe regions in the recently published Economic Assessment to1972 and in the context of our regional policy as a whole and ofthe constraints imposed by national economic circumstances.We are convinced that it is necessary to retain for thedevelopment areas and special development areas a. large margin of preference in assistance to industry.    I do not proposetherefore to accept the Hunt Committeers recommendation for thede-scheduling of Merseyside.   Although the massive increase inGovernment preferential assistance to industry - for these areas - from some  30 million in 196h. to over ; 260 million - is making a vital and growing contribution to overcoming theirstill serious structural problems, none of these areas is yet ready for de-scheduling.Against this background we have considered carefully thearguments for spreading limited resources over the whole of thetwo Regions concerned   and for concentrating these on a fewareas where present and prospective needs are greatest.    Wehave concluded that the better course is to concentrate assist-ance to industry with an employment link on a strictly limited number of smaller areas.    For this reason, we have not been ableto accept the. Hunt Committee1 s proposal for a general. TauiLdinggrant.   The Government consider that the selection of areas tobe given assistance to -Industry must be governed strictly bycriteria of need,  especially the level and character ofunemployment and numbers of unemployed, the incidence of high2. /netCONFIDENTIALt -

We propose to seek powers to make available to these inter-mediate areas certain assistance under the Local Employment Acts.This will not include the loans and grants, for general purposes,which are made in the development areas on the advice of theBoard of Trade Advisory Committee.What it will include is:(i)    Grants at 25 per cent (or in certain cases 35 per cent)of factory building costs;(ii)    Government built factories, either at the request ofai particular firm (custom built factories) or withouta known occupier in mind (advance factories) on thesame basis as in the development areasj3.CONFIDENTIALnet outward migration and the real scope for industrial growth.I turn now to our proposals.Assistance to Industry: AreasI must emphasise, in indicating the areas to which in ourview these criteria most clearly point, that I describe them in broad terms and the precise boundaries of these new intermediateareas have yet to be determined:The Yorkshire coalfield area and part of theNotts/Derby coalfield area, together with partsof Humberside, North East Lancashire and SouthEast Wales and also Leith and Plymouth.We wish to take fully into account any further views of the regional Economic Planning Councils.    Consultations with them will be completed in time for the announcement of our final decisions after the Whitsun Recess and thereafter we will bring forward the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.   Wehave considered the problems of other areas, but we have concluded that these problems do not at present justify the useof financial incentives to divert industry to them.Assistance to Industry: Measures 

CONFIDENTIAL(iii)   The full range of development area training grants and other training assistance together with assistance for the transfer of key workers.The date from which firms will he eligible for this assistance will he announced later.We agree with the Hunt Committee that industry in the inter-mediate areas should he cncouraged particularly in places whichhave real . scope for growth.    The studies made &quot;by regional economic Planning Councils have attached importance to thedevelopment of suitable growth zones and we will take Councils&apos;views fully into account.There will be some additional expenditure on roads in the selected areas and proposals for the provision of now housingassociated with industrial growth will bo encouraged.   There willalso bo an enlarged national programme for derelict land clearancefor schemes certified by the Board of Trade as contributing to thedevelopment of industry in the area.    For the North West and the yorkshire and Humborside Regions, as a whole,  in the areas selected for assistance to industry and in the North Staffordshire andNotts./Derby planning sub-divisions, we intend to seek power tomake available to local authorities a capital grant of 75 per cent.The industrial development certificate control is operatedflexibly and with sensitivity to industrial and local circumstances,tut it remains essential to relate its operation overall to the priorities of our regional policy, particularly to the needs ofthe development areas.    The Board of Trade will continue to operate the i.d.c. control so as to give the development areas and thenew intermediate areas general priority.    In the rest of the North^st and the Yorkshire and Humbcrside Regions, the control willwntinB to be administered relatively freely, except in congestedP^to or places otherwise unsuitable for industrial expansion,    in^* /thoseCONFIDENTIAL

those cases Qf over;,pill towns where planned de-vjelepmejitvmay- *bo held up if the flow of.industry to them from a parentconurbation is impeded, we will apply a more flexible policy since it is certainly our intention that all approved schemesfor new and.expanding towns should be properly supported byemployment opportunities.    We do not, therefore accept theproposals that all control over moves to overspill towns should&quot;be removed and that the general exemption limit should beincreased to 10,000 square feet.In order to meet the financial cost of these measureswithout anet addition   to total public expenditure, we havedecided to reduce the development area rate of investment grant from i+0 per cent to 35 per cent.    To give firms adequate timeto adjust to this change,  this new rate of grant will applyto eligible capital expenditure incurred as from ^/&quot;lst AprilJ7/**lst july?, 1970.   As grant is paid a year in arrears, thepublic expenditure saving - which will be over  20 million grossin a full year - will start to accrue in 1971-72.    This shouldhe sufficient to match the probable scale of the new expenditure.My rt. hon. Friend, the President, will be laying an Order beforethe House to give effect to this measure.A high proportion of expenditure on this investment grantscheme is now going to capital-intensive schemes in thedevelopment areas, and we believe that the regional rate of investment grant is somewhat higher than is needed in order forthem to be assured of continuing to attract a high proportionof capital investment.We will maintain in full all the other inducements designedto use the manpower resources of the development areas - the regional employment premium and other selective employment. /payments
