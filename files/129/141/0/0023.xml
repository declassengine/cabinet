COPY NO.cabinet for MURDER &quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Homeand the Secretary of State for &quot;scotland in this memorandum we invite our colleagues to agree that theGovernment should take the initiative in making permanent the abolitionof capital punishment a3 the penalty for murder; and we make proposals on tactics and timing.2.     The Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 was introduced by Sydney Silverman with Government help and passed on a free vote bysubstantial majorities of both Houses (350 to 170 in the Commons, 204to 104 in the Lords).     It abolished capital punishment for those offences of murder for which, under the Homicide Act, 1957 it was still themandatory penalty.     A summary of the 1957 Act is in Appendix A,Section 4 of the.1965 Act, inserted as a result of an amendment moved by Henry Brooke, and carried against Government advice, has the effectthat the Act lapses after 31st July, 1970, unless Parliament otherwisedetermines by affirmative resolutions of each House,    These would besimple resolutions.    No statutory order is required.    The Houseauthorities, surprisingly, take the view that resolutions could providefor temporary extension.    Our advice, however, is that this would notbe permissible under the Act and that the only choice is either to makethe Act permanent or to let it lapse.    It seems to us that, quite apartfrom any doubts about the legal position, a temporary extension wouldbe most undesirable.3.     We do not think that our colleagues will need any convincing thatthe abolition of capital punishment ought to be made permanent.4.     The essential case for abolition is in our view a moral oneaCapital punishment is a barbaroxis penalty which the community has no right to exact, however heinous the crime.    There are however othersubsidiary arguments in favour of abolition.    The death penalty is adenial of the principle underlying the rest of our penal thinking, thatno criminal is beyond the hope of redemption.    In the event of doubtarising about the verdict after the sentence has been carried out, thereis no opportunity to right the wrong.    We think that those who advocate4-OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)

capital punishment are under the onus of establishing that this barbarouspenalty is a unique deterrent? but there is no conclusive evidence, eitherhere or eslewhere, to support such a contention.    There is also theconsideration that, if the 1965 Act were allowed to lapse, the 1957Homicide Act TSould be restored.    But this was widely regarded asunsatisfactory by advocates of capital punishment, as well as by oppon-ents, and was subject td strong criticism from the judges.    Yet few ofthe advocates of capital punishment would welcome a return to thesituation obtaining before 1957, when the death penalty wa3 pronouncedon all those found guilty of murder, although it was executed in only a minority of cases.    Although there is undoubted support for restoration,there is no broad agreement on the form that it should take.    In our viewany attempt at categorisation would produce anomalies- as unacceptable asthose under the 1957 Act.5.     We do not think that the caoe for abolition should stand or fall onstatistical grounds, but no doubt the figures will be freely used in any public discussion.    Appendix B gives corrected figures for offences of murder known to the police in Great Britain in the years 195 8-67.    Thefigures for recorded offences of murder in England and Wales in 1967was 168, the highest since tne Homicide Act.     The 1968 figure will notbe known until next month? but it looks as though it will be a little lower than that for 1967 but still higher than the figures for most recent years.It seems that there is an upward trend in murders committed by peoplenot known to be mentally abnormal, although the greatest increase was between 1963 and 1964, when executions were still taking place.    Post-abolition estimates of murders that would have been capital must betreated with great caution, since it is pretty well certain that some&quot;murders&quot; would have been found not to be capital if the issue had beentried.    Estimates made now cannot identify cases in which a jury,having beard all the evidence, might properly have decided against averdict of capital murder.     Still less can they identify cases in which ajury might have returned a perverse verdict in face of clear evidence,Also, estimates for &quot;capital&quot; murder include those committed by theinsane and by suspects who commit suicide.    The increase in murdersin Scotland, starting from small figures, is proportionately greater.As in England and Wales, the 1967 figure was the highest.    The 1968figure is likely to be about the same as for 1967.6.     The figures referred to in the previous paragraph, and theinferences that can be drawn from them, should be set in the context of the available information about experience in other countries wherecapital punishment has been abolished.    As explained in paragraphs7-8 of Appendix B, thib suggests that abolition of capital punishmentdoes not bring about a permanent upward trend in the murder rate which would not have occurred if it had been retained.7.     There have been increases in other serious crime; in particular,there was an increase inEngland and Wales in indictable offences of violence against the person of 33.3 per cent (from 17,601 to 23,470)between 1961 and 1964, and an increase of 23. 8 per cent (from 23,47 0to 29,048) between 1964 and 1967,    For robbery, the corresponding increases were 30.5 per cent (2,349 in 1961 and 3,066 in 1964) and48. 9 per cent (4,564 in 1967).    But the same statistics can be used by-2-

different people for different purposes.    The advocates of abolition will no doubt point to the fact that increases in the murder figures have to be looked at in the context of increases in crime generally.    Those whofavour restoration will no doubt attribute to abolition of capital punish-ment some share of the responsibility for increases in other forms of violent crime.8.     There can be little doubt that the majority opinion in the House ofCommons is in favour of abolition.    Sydney Silvermanrs Bill was passedby a substantial majority and subsequent motions favourable to capital punishment have been decisively rejected.    The shift in politicalbalance, the replacement of older by younger Members and the general trend of opinion seem likely to have strengthened the abolitionist cause.The next occasion for testing the weight of opinion in the House ofCommons will come on 24th June, when Mr. Sandys will seek leaveunder the Ten Minute Rule to introduce a Bill on capital punishment.9.     But there can also be little doubt that the Hcuse of Commons isahead of public opinion,,    Some details of opinion polls are given inparagraph 6 of Appendix B.10.     Should the Government take the initiative in seeking to make the1965 Act permanent?    Or should this be lefc, as the Silverman Bill was left, to a Private Member with Government support?    We are in nodoubt that this is now a matter for Government initiativev though it wouldaccord with tradition to allow a free vote.11.     When should the affirmative resolutions be taken?    They must betaken by the end of July, 1970; but we know of no reason why they shouldnot be taken a good deal earlier, if that is a convenient course.    Asregards the statistical timetable, the corrected murder figures for thecomplete year for England and Wales are generally available the follow -ing May.    Any interim figures published earlier in the year would be bound to be an inflated one,    But if we wait until the corrected 1969figures are available, the debate would have to be in May-July, 1970,and would be likely to be conducted in a pre-election atmosphere.   We donot accept that the abolition period is an experiment the success of whichcan be judged solely by reference to the statistics, and if we decide to forgo the 1969 figures, as we think we should, there is no reason why the affirmative resolutions should not be taken this year - though perhaps not before the autumn, when a revised edition of the Home OfficeResearch Unit Report &quot;Murder&quot;, bringing it up to the end of 1968, willbe ready.12,     A further argument in favour of taking the resolutions early rests on the possibility, which though slight cannot be ruled out, that theymiglit be rejected in one or other House.    Rejection by the Lords couldnot be over-ridden; and we are told that the rules of procedure wouldnot permit either House to be asked, whether by legislation or freshresolutions, to reverse a previous decision taken in the same Session.Rejection in the summer of 197 0 would leave no opportunity for anything-3-

CONROEMTSALbut acceptance for a time of the revival of the Homicide Act,    Rejectionat the beginning of the 1969-70 Session might just leave time for legisla-tion not amounting to a flat reversal^ for example, extending the abolitionAct for a limited period, to be enacted (though not carried through ifrejected in the Lords) by the end of July, 1970,    Rejection in the closingdays of the current Session would not give rise to any proceduralrestrictions as regards reversal in the 1969-70 Session.13.     We would welcome the views of our colleagues both on thegeneral proposition that the resolutions would be best taken in theautumn of this year, and, if this is accepted, on whether the debateswould be better held in the closing days of the present Session after the summer Recess or in the early days of the 1969-7 0 Session.14.     Whenever the debates are to be held, it would be desirable to stimulate informed support for the case for permanent abolition.Mr. Sandys will no doubt intensify the nation-wide petition for restorationof capital punishment which he instituted in the autumn of 1967: but onthe other side of the argument, the Committee of the National campaign for the Abolition of Capital Punishment has been reactivated, withCanon Collins as its Chairman.     In addition to Ministerial speeches,information might be prepared for back-benchers and suitable outsidecommentators.15.     We invite our colleagues to agree -(i)   That the Government should take the initiative in bringing about the permanent abolition of capita) punishment for murder.(ii)   That the necessary affirmative resolutions should betaken in the autumn of 1969, either at the end of thepresent Session or at the beginning of the 1969-70Session.L.

Appendix 1 A1The Homicide Act 1957The Homicide Act was introduced after the rejection bythe House of Lords of Sydney Silverman&apos;s Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill, which the House of Commons had passed on a free vote.     It confined   capital punishment to those formsof murder which were considered to strike especially at theroots of law and order and in which its deterrent effect mightbe thought most likely to operate, namely:(i)   murder in the course of furtherance of theft;(ii)   murder by shooting or causing an explosion;(iii)   murder- in the course of resisting arrest orescaping from legal custody;    and(iv)   murder of a police or prison officer.The Act also retained the death penalty for any type ofrepeated murder*     For any other type of murder the penalty   1became life imprisonment,2,     The Act also introduced, in England and Wales, thedefence of diminished responsibility, by which &quot;where a personkills or is party to a killing of another, he shall not beconvicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormalityof mind (whether arising from a condition of arrest or retardeddevelopment of mind or any inherent causes or induced bydinease or injury) as substantially impaired his mentalresponsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing&quot;.     A person charged with murder who puts forward a successful defence on this count is convicted ofmanslaughter,.     These provisions did not apply to Scotland.Their effect was generally to bring the law of England andWales more closely into line with the existing law ofScotland.3*      The concept of&quot; categories or murder introduced by the Actwas frequently criticised during the period of its operation by both opponents and supporters of capital punishment.     Bothsides argued that it was unfair in its application and resultedin people being sentenced to death, and sometimes, executed, for offences of murder that seemed less heinous than others that were non-capital.     For instance, if a mar, killed his victimwith a gun, he committed capital murder, but if the weaponwas an axe or knife, or if he slowly poisoned him, his offencewas non-capitalo

Appendix BStatistics of MurderEngland and wales the figures for offences of murder known to the police inEngland and Wales are subjected to a continuing process of adjustment to take account of decisions by the courts during and beyond the end of the calendar year in which the offences became known, and it is the resultant latest corrected figures that are normally, used for comparative purposes.     Annual figures on this basis, which relate to the numbez-s of victims of murder, aregenerally announced to Parliament in the May following the year towhich they relate, when the number of undecided cases still beforethe courts Jias been reduced to two or three.      The figures arestill subject to change either as a result of appeal or by thesolution of previously unsolved cases.     The latest correctedfigures for the years 1958-1967 are shown below, with theestimated numbers of &quot;capital&quot; murders and the numbers of murdersin which suspects were not known to he mentally abnormal.&quot;Mentally abnormal&quot; here includes those who were found to beinsane and those who committed suicide.

2.     Although the case for and against capital punishment does notrest primarily on statistical considerations, arrangements havebeen made for the Home Office Research Unit report &quot;Murder&quot; to bebrought up to date so as to provide an analysis of murderstatistics for England and Wales up to and including 1968.     Thisreport should be ready for publication in August or September 1969.3.     It is also hoped to have available by then an interim reporton a research study into the sociology and psychopathology of murder which is being conducted under the direction of Mr. LouisBlom-Cooper, Dr. Terence Morris and Dr. A. Hyatt Williams.     the study is of case histories of known murderers in England andWales.Scotlandh.     The Scottish figures are not fully comparable with those for england and Wales, since they relate to the numbers of &quot;completedacts of murder&quot;, one of which can involve more than one victim.There is no established practice for publication of the annualfigures during the following year.     The latest corrected figuresfor 1958-1967 are shown below.Scotland	(A)	(B)	(c)		Murdera known	Murders in (a) in	Estimate of	Murders in (c) in	to the police	which suspects were	&quot;capital&quot;	which suspects were		not known te be	murders	not know tp be		memtally abnormal	within (a)	mentally abnormal		(including unsolved		(including unsolved		murders)		murders)1958	14	8	5	31959	12	8	2	11960	14	9	3	21961	10	8	2	21962	24	13	4	21963	14	7	4	319S4	23	10	1	11965	29	23	1	11966	3*	22	2	m196?	&apos;   39	34	12	85.

Public Opinion Polls6.     A poll carried out &quot;by Operation Research Centre and published in the Evening Standard on 7th March found the followingpercentages in favour of the restoration of capital punishment for various kinds of murder:    child murder, 83 per cent;    murder of apoliceman, 78 per cent;   with a firearm, 67 per cent;    duringrobbery, 65 per cent;   by poison, 6h per cent;    and &quot;over a loveaffair&quot; 36 per cent.     &quot;Don&apos;t knows&quot; ranged from 2 to 7 per cent.Earlier surveys of public opinion undertaken in July and september 1966 by Gallup and National Opinion Polls respectiv^^&apos;&apos;found 76 and 82 per cent in favour of the restoration of the death penalty (with 18 and 15 per cent against and 6 and 3 percent undecided).     The survey in September 1966 was conductedshortly after the shooting of three policemen at Shepherds Bushon 12th August.     Shortly before the House of Commons committee stage of Mr. Silverman&apos;s Bill in February 1965, two similarsurveys found that 67 per cent and 70 per cent were opposed tothe abolition of capital punishment.Overseas experience7.     Over the years much effort has been put into attempts to collect and evaluate data about the effect on the murder rate ofthe abolition of capital punishment in different countries ofthe world.     The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1919-53,reviewed the available evidence (Cmd. 8932 Appendix 6);    and areport prepared for the United Nations Economic and Social Councilin 1962, and a supplementary report covering the period of 1961-5,also contain sections on the experience of abolition in othercountries.8.     Comparisons between the criminal statistics of one countryand another are never easy owing to differences of definition andclassification;    and the inferences drawn are controversial.The Royal Commission and United Nations material includes studiescomparing the homicide statistics of abolitionist states withthose of otherwise similar retentionist statos (in particularstudies of different states within Australia and the U.S.A.), andcomparing the homicide rate in various countries before and afterthe abolition of capital pun: establishment (and, in a few cases, itsreintroduction).     The conclusion suggested by these studies, as summarised in the United Nations report, is that, where the murderrate is increasing, abolition does not appear to hasten theincrease;   where the rate is decreasing, abolition does notappear to interrupt the decrease;    and where the rate is stable,the presence or absence of capital punishment does not appear to affect it.     The Royal Commissions own conclusion was that therewas no clear evidence in any of the figures that it had examinedthat the abolition of capital punishment had led to an increasein the homicide rate, or that its reintroduction had led to a fall.9.     It is noteworthy that in the U.S.A., with all its violentcrime, no executions were carried out last year.     arrangements are in hand for obtaining up-to-date particulars of the law andthe incidence of murder in that country, and also in Canada,Australasia and the more important countries of Western Europe.
