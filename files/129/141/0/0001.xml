QiMlM. COPY NO.11th March, 1969CABINETF ORE IGN INTERESTSMemorandum by the Paymaster GeneralThe Parliamentary Committee on 10th March discussed two possibilities: a widening of the obligation on Members of Parliamentto declare pecuniary interests, and a requirement on propagandistsworking in the United Kingdom on behalf of foreign political interests to register their existence and activities.    On the first matter a paper is being circulated by the Prime Minister.    On the second matter I was invited to circulate a paper after consultation with the Attorney-General,but in the short time available the latter has not yet been able to give thematter the full consideration he thinks is necessary.The United States example2.     The only democratic country to which we can look for an example of legislation already in being for the registration of foreign-controlledpolitical propagandists is the United States.    Their example is all themore interesting in that there too the objective is fairly limited and specific: to bring out into the open the activities of any person organisation, whether seeking to influence legislators or the public generally, that is working on behalf of foreign political interests (while leaving purely domestic pressure group activities untouched except inthe field of the lobbying or interests of legislators).3,      The relevant United States statute is the Foreign AgentsRegistration Act of 1938, as amended.    Broadly it provides as follows;(a) The object is to protect the country ls national defence, internal security and foreign relations by requiring public disclosure by those who disseminate political propaganda on behalf of foreign government and interests, so that people can assess theirstatements and actions accordingly.    The foreign governments and interests include insurgents and political parties as wellas actual governments de jure and de facto.(b) Those paid or otherwise induced by foreign interests to engage in such propaganda must, under oath, register the objectsand other details of their commitment, together with informa-tion about all their other activities and interests, within 10 days[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)

of accepting the commitment; re-register every is mostShswhile it continues; and also file copies of all propagandamaterial sent through the mails.(c) This information is made available by the Attorney-general for inspection by other Departments, and by the public on payment.(d) The Attorney-General also makes periodic reports to theCongress about the propaganda operations thus revealedand about the way the law is working.(e) Fines, imprisonment and injunctions can all be sought toenforce the law.(f) The Press, if at least 80 per cent American owned, isspecifically exempt from these requirements.(g) American business firms which are foreign-ownedsubsidiaries are also exempt in respect of their domesticbusiness promotion activities even if these benefit their foreign parent organisations - provided that they declaretheir overseas connections when dealing with any Governmentofficial, and that their parent organisation is not wholly or mainly owned by a foreign government.Points needing special examination in the United States example4.      On the face of it, legislation broadly on these lines might wellmeet the requirements of the United Kingdom, subject to taking dueaccount of the differences in the constitutional context.    The clearconcentration cn safeguarding national defence,, security and foreign relations would make it easier to resist attempts to extend the scope and difficulty of the registration system into a much wider and very different field by bringing in domestically oriented pressure groupsas well.    But there are many points both of principle and of practice which need careful further examination in the combined interest of administrative efficiency and political freedom.    Examples are asfollows;(a) In the United States legislation the link with the foreignprincipal goes wider than gain, and thus dangerously extendsthe area of uncertainty as to liability for registration.Possibly the principal/agent relationship should be made to depend on remuneration.(b) Since propaganda activities procured by United Kingdombusiness firms would not (on the American model) be brought within the registration requirement merely because the propaganda happened to suit not only the firmJs business interests but also the interests of a foreign government, thesituation could arise in which, for instance, a British-registered copper-mining firm promoting support in this

country for one African regime as against another, in theinterests of its business, would be exempt from registrationunless it were a subsidiary of a foreign firm owned by the regime that it favoured.(c) In establishing what constitutes an oversea government or interest for purposes of the legislation, it would be necessaryto reach a decision as to the status desired for,e. g. governments or interests in (i) Commonwealth(ii) colonial territories.    If colonial territories were for thispurpose to be treated as if they were part of the UnitedKingdom, it would seem that under legislation in terms ofthe United States Act there would be an exemption fromregistration for propaganda here on behalf of the Hong KongGovernment in favour of tariff relaxation - or even onbehalf of private pro-Smitb Rhodesian citizens acting on theirown initiative,(d) The United States statute appears to bring under registrationnot only the information services of oversea governments(e. g. the British Information Services (BIS)) but alsocommercial distributors of books and magazines which contain propaganda supporting foreign governments andparties - e. g. Cuba, Communist China; and it is not clearthat this does not involve a liability to registration for bonafide book importers and booksellers.(e) The United States exemption of the Press and the Pres6services by reference to the extent of control and influencefrom abroad could conceivably permit a degree ofGovernment interference that would be thought unacceptablein the United Kingdom.(f) The United States Governments use and enforcement of thestatute entails a right of inspection of all the books and records of registered propagandists by officials of theInternal Security Division and the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI).    Moreover, much seems to depend, inthe administration of the statute, on the discretion of the attorney-General.    Any similar legislation for the UnitedKingdom would need to incorporate effective safeguards against the possibility of abuse in the hands of futureGovernments.    One prerequisite would be more specificand limited definitions of liability for registration than the americans have considered necessary in their differentconstitutional situation.5.     It must also be noted that we have no information to show howfar the United States statute has in fact had the effect of bringing out into the open the propaganda activities carried out there on behalf offoreign interests.    One would expect skilful and determined

operators to be able to violate the law with impunity, unless the investigations carried out by the Government and its agencies werecontinuous, widespread and searching,,    The Attorney-Generalsreport to the Congress in July, 1966, showed 511 active registrationson the files, and no prosecutions for wilful violations during the year.It gave no information which would enable one to judge whether thefigures meant success or failurej all one can say is that 511 registra-tions must have meant 511 organisations working in the open who might otherwise, in a few cases, have been working unseen.    The number pfregistrations and prosecutions does not of course necessarily tell thefull story.6.     In further examining the United States example we would also need to consider the administrative cost in money and manpower.The amount of detail which the United States statute requires to be registered and re-registered, checked, published, transmitted to various quarters, appears to be very considerable.    It might bepossible in the United Kingdom to simplify it.    There would still bethe burdens of administration, however, and also those arising fromParliamentary answer ability.7.       If the Governments decision and statement on the need for legislation are to be made very soon - i. e. just before the House risesfor Easter - we still have about ten days for an urgent examination ofthese questions.    If, ae a result, our decision is that legislation should be prepared, there will presumably be time before it is intro-duced to take account in its detailed preparation of any relevant information or views which may arise from the work of any SelectCommittee set up to consider the other question of a wider obligation on Members of Parliament to declare their interests.conclusions.   (a) The Foreign Agents Registration Act in the United Statesseems broadly to provide the kind of propagandaregistration requirement, limited in concept and interms to activities undertaken on behalf of foreign interests, for which we can identify a need in the UnitedKingdom.(b) We do not know, however, just how effective it is in theUnited States or how effective a similar statute wouldbe here.(c) Points requiring most careful further thought would include:(i)   the definition of the relationship between thepropagandist in the United Kingdom and the principaloverseas;-4-SECRET

(ii)   problems arising in connection with propagandafavouring interests in British Commonwealth and colonial territories;(iii) distinctions between political propaganda procuredby British controlled businesses and identicalpropaganda procured by businesses owned by foreign governments;(iv) the position of book importers and booksellers;(v)    safeguards for Press freedom;(vi)   safeguards against abuse of the investigation systemunderlying enforcement;(vii)   administrative cost and Ministerial responsibility.(d)   If, as a xesult, it is decided that there should be legislation,there would be merit in testing the views of parliament on the areas to be covered, before drafting is too far advanced.J.H.7 0, Whitehall, S.W. 1.11th March, 1969-5-SECRET
