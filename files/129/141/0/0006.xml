SECRETIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)3.......-----------------------------------------------------------ICOPY NO.    6f)CABINETTHE EUROPEAN PROJECT FOR A MULTI-ROLECOMBAT AIRCRAFTNote hy the Secretary of State for DefenceMy colleagues may like to have a brief progress report on the project for a Multi-role Combat Aircraft (MRCA),,2,     Agreement was reached in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee towards the end of last year about the operational require -ments of the four participating countries.    Feasibility studies were tobe completed at about the beginning of February, so as to enable decisions to be taken about the future cf the project, with the aim of beginning a project Definition Phase by about the beginning of April.    the project would then proceed on a step-by-step basis, under the termsof a General Memorandum of Understanding defining the conditionswhich would govern national participation in the future stages of thewhole project, including the principles of work sharing and the rules for withdrawal.3,      The feasibility studies led to two separate designs, one by theBritish Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and one by Messerchmitt-BHlkow,which, though offering different solutions in a number of respects, eachbroadly confirmed the expectation that it would be possible to meet thefuture combat aircraft requirements of all four participating countries by variants of one basic design.    The British version of the aircraft would have at least 85 per cent commonality with that favoured by theother Consortium countries.     Following further work by the joint industrial Company, a single design has now been produced, which has still to be evaluated by the four countries.4.      There have, however, been two developments which have delayedprogress:(a)    The Germans have recently sought to change their operationalrequirement in a way which would increase the costs of the project.C(69) 3117th March, 1969

(b)    The Germans seem to be favouring the use of an Americanengine for the project, details of which have been so farreleased by the United States to the Germans alone, and notto the Consortium as a whole.Discussions are at present taking place among officials, and we have asked the Americans to release to us the information needed for properengine evaluation.    Depending on the outcome of these steps, Ipropose to discuss progress with The Federal German defence minister Dr. SchrtJder, in the near future.5.     Meanwhile good progress has been made with setting upworkable arrangements for the management and control of the projecton the industrial and international Governmental level.    discussions on the General Memorandum of Understanding have continued andoutstanding differences have been narrowed down.6. As agreed by my colleagues in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee, an interdepartmental working party of officials is engaged on a full examination of the requirement for the aircraft.7.     If all goes well, progress on the final design configurationshould allow a start to be made on the Project Definition Phase in May,though it is likely that further work will still be necessary before adecision or the choice of engine can be made.    The ProjectDefinition Phase will last about a year.    The extent of further commit-ment by the United Kingdom represented by this phase is not expectedto be more than  6 million.    Our present information is that all other participating members are expected to continue into this Phase,8.     It is the aim, despite the recent difficulties which have arisen,to complete the evaluation work which is now needed and to arrive atdraft proposals to be put before Governments within a few weeks, andI plan to make recommendations to my colleagues about futureparticipation in this project during the latter half of April, taking account of the interdepartmental examination of our requirements.9.     I invite my colleagues:(a) to take note of the present status of the MRCA Project;(b) to note that I hope to be in a position to make recommendations about United Kingdom participation in the future stages of the project in about a month&apos;s time.D.W.H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.17th March, 1969
