fooCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)17th March, 1969COPY NO.CABINETCONCORDE.  THE LEGAL POSITIONMemor andum by the Attorney &quot;GeneralMy colleagues will wish to know my views on our legal position in the light of the latest Concorde Directing Committee (CDC)Report on the Concorde project and in particular whether we could ifwe wished now withdraw from the project unilaterally without runningan unacceptable risk of paying damages to the French if they took us tothe International Court.2.     It will be recalled that the Minister of Technology&apos;s negotiationswith M. Chamant last September culminated in an agreement which fell short of what we set out to achieve.    The proposals put forward byM. Chamant are at Annex B to the Minister of Technology&apos;s memorandum.We had hoped to secure French agreement to a position whereby if we didnot have orders from four major airlines, including one American airline,by the end of 1969, or if at any time before that date the development cost estimate rose above  600 million we would be free to withdrawunilaterally.   In my paper of 22nd October 1968 (C(68) 114) I explained to what extent the proposals put forward by M. Chamant fell short ofour objectives and in particular I pointed out that unqualified acceptanceof the proposals would commit us to continuing with the project until theend of 1969.    I also pointed out:-(a) as respects airline orders, that if at the end of 1969 therestill remained a hope of orders we were not automaticallyentitled to withdraw on the ground that no orders were in prospect; and(b) on the criterion of cost, that cur commitment to the end of1969 precluded our withdrawing unilaterally before that datenotwithstanding that the estimate might have risen to above  600 million.I advised however that such rights as we already possessed in inter-national law might be preserved if we made it clear that our acceptancewas without prejudice to the? right of the parties to an international agreement to terminate it where a fundamentally altered situation arose.The Cabinet accepted this advice and the Minister replied to M. Chamantaccordingly.-1-

k^^rf K^EEi fa3.      Doa5-the-i^C-Eepprt-ejitJtJein the light of the Chamant proposals ?The date at which airline orders can be expected has been postponed from the end of 1969 until the middle of 1970.    However wecannot now say that at the end of 1969 there will be no prospect oforders (see paragraph 2b of the Chamant proposals) so we cannotassert that, we are in a situation whereby at the end of 1969 we willbe entitled to withdraw on the ground of absence of orders.     So faras the development cost estimate is concerned, although we cannow say that by the end of 1969 we will have exceeded the  600 millionmaximum provided for by paragraph 2d of the proposals, our rights under paragraph 2d do not accrue until the end of 1969.    We are,however, already in the situation envisaged by paragraph 3 of theproposals whereby Ministers are required &quot;to consider the situation&quot;.On one view of the matter it is arguable that this would give some support to the proposition that there is an entitlement to withdrawnow.    On the other hand the transcript of the discussions leading tothe Chamant agreement indicate that paragraph 3 was not intended togive either Government a unilateral right to withdrawal before the endof 1969.    In my view a Court would be more likely to accept thatconstruction,4.     Does the CDC Report entitle us to withdraw unilaterally now on the ground of fundamental change of circumstances ?In his reply to M. Chamant the Minister said that acceptanceof the proposals was without prejudice to whatever rights aGovernment may have on the ground of a fundamental change of circumstances,    I think if we withdrew unilaterally and the Frenchtook us to the International Court we would have a respectable case and a stronger case than we have had hitherto.    Our argument wouldbe that, making a realistic appraisal of the project in the light of theCDC Report, the difficulties with the cost, payload, timescale, noiseand sonic boom, were cumulatively of an order that justified withdrawal,In particular, we would say, they had agreed to two criteria by whichthe wisdom of continuing with the project should be judged and since itwas clear that at least one of these, namely, the costs criterion,would not be met, we were entitled to regard our commitment as atan end.5.     For their part the French would argue that it was whollyunreasonable of us to withdraw at this stage of the project when somuch money and effort had been committed, when the aircraft was already flying and when there remained good chances of success.They would be supported in this by both the French and british manufacturers and by F-rench Government experts.    On the present state of the evidence my assessment of our chances before theInternational Court is that if we withdrew at this stage we would haverather less than a fifty-fifty chance of success.-2-SECRET

6.     Can we withdraw unilaterally at the end of 1969 ?The Chamant agreement provides that if at the end of 1969 theestimated development costs exceed  600 million in January 1966conditions, each of the two Ministers is to propose to their respective governments an amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding of1962 releasing each Government from any automatic obligation tocontinue the project jointly.    As I explained in my Memorandum of22nd October 1968, this does not in terms give us an agreed right of unilateral withdrawal because there is no express obligation on theFrench Government to accept the recommendation.    If however they refused to accept it, in my opinion we could withdraw unilaterallywithout running a serious risk of having to pay damages unless theCourt were to take the view that commercial prospects were relevantand that those prospects were good, or unless the French had offeredus reasonable terms for continuation that we should have accepted.7.     Future negotiations with the FrenchIt is of first importance that in our negotiations with the french from now on we do nothing to prejudice our legal position under theChamant agreement.    The M.inister&apos;s approach at the forthcoming meeting with M. Chamant should be that we are already in the critical situation envisaged in paragraph 3 of the agreement.    If theGovernment decide to continue with the project it must be made clearthat we regard the agreement as still applicable and that the criteriatherein specified still apply.F. E.
