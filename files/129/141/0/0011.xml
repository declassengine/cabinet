INDUSTRIAL relations memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Employment and ProductivityAs my colleagues know, it will take about a year to pass the proposed!Industrial Relations Bill into law.   This is inevitable in view of the complexity of the proposals and the time needed for consultation.I,   I have become increasingly aware of the need for early action to improveindustrial relations and I am sure the public expects the Government to act now.The establishment of the Commission on Industrial Relations (C.I.R.), to whom expect shortly to make the first references, provides the opportunity to initiate the reform of collective bargaining, particularly the development ofacceptable disciplinary practices and grievance procedures.   But additionalaeasures are required to advance the influence of unionism and extend the scopeof collective bargaining within the context of appropriate safeguards for theinterests of the community,   I therefore propose the introduction this Sessionof an interim Industrial Relations Bill.Content of the bill,   Given the need to keep an interim bill as short as possible I think thatthe following items would be the most suitable for inclusion:(l)   the right of individual employees to belong to a trade union(coupled with this we might have the provision to prevent anyfriendly society having a rule denying to its members the rightto belong to a trade union);(2)   discretionary powers for the Secretary of State, on therecommendation of the Commission on Industrial Relations, to order an employer to recognise and bargain with a trade union(and where the employer fails to do so, the trade union concerned to have the right unilaterally to refer a claim for arbitration by the Industrial Court);(3)   changes in the trade dispute disqualification for unemploymentbenefit to a worker who is not participating or directly interested in a trade dispute (i.e. the abolition of the&apos;grade or class&apos; and &quot;financing&apos; provision of Section 22 of theNational Insurance Act 1965);/(4)   discretionary

sechetdiscretionary power for the Secretary of State to secure a conciliation pause of not more than 28 days in seriousunconstitutional strikes and in strikes where thereis noagreed procedure or for other reasons, adequate joint discussions have not taken place;(5)discretionary power for the Secretary of State to requireunions to hold a ballot on the question of strike actionwhere this may involve a serious threat to the economy or public interest and there is doubt whether it commands thesupport of those concerned;(6)   the establishment of the Industrial Board to examine caseswhere there is an alleged breach of a strike ballot or aconciliation pause order and to impose penalties on those(employers or employees) who are judged to have defied anorder,4,   There is one obvious omission from these items - the power to deal withinter-union recognition disputes.   But, quite apart from shortage of time,the case for including it this session is less pressing since I shall in any event be bound to defer reference of disputes of this kind to the C.I.B..until after the T.U.Co has done what it can to resolve the problem.The Parliamentary Time-Table5.   I am under no illusion about the time-table problems in getting an interim bill through.   Even the relatively modest bill prepared for this session would attract a wide range of amendments drawn - inter-alia - fromother sections of the White Paper.Conclusion0&quot; I invite my colleagues agreement to the introduction of a short interimbill this session and to its proposed contents.Bo A, C.April, IQfiq2.
