11 IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69) 2817th March, 1969COPY NO,cabinet european 250-oEATER aircraft memorandum by the Minister of TechnologyIntroductionThe French and Germans have now announced that they are infavour of launching the A300B 250-seater aircraft, leaving the door open for us to join.    They have suggested a tripartite meeting of Ministersearly in April,2.      The firms concerned are Sud Aviation in France (who will lead the project), the Deutsche Airbus Group in Germany, and hawker siddeley here.    This consortium withdrew their earlier and largerA300 design in December.    We then told the French and Germans thatwe could not regard ourselves as committed in any way to support thenew proposals, and should wish to evaluate them alongside the british aircraft Corporation (BAC) 311.3.      BAC have been working on their 311 design for about a year, andhave extensively canvassed world airlines.    They have tentative plans to collaborate with Lockheed in the United States and are seeking otherpartners such as Italy and the Netherlands.The A300B4.       I believe that there is a very strong case for taking a major share in a civil aircraft project of about this size, but do not believe that anadequate case has yet been made out for Government support of theA300B.    For their own reasons, the French and Germans have rushedthe decision before airlines have had an opportunity to decide about thenew aircraft, and before any real attempt has been made to improve theterms on which the consortium are seeking Government assistance.-1-

5,       Though there has been a recent reorganisation in French industry,it has not yet been demonstrated to our satisfaction that Sud Aviationhave sufficient resources, particularly in management staffs to lead this project effectively at the same time as the Concorde,    The recentslippage of Concorde dates means that peak effort on the two aircraft will coincide.Airline orders6,       While we cannot expect airlines to place firm orders until they know what Government support there will be for the A300B, I believethat all three Governments should have avoided any commitment atleast until the attitude of the three national airlines was clearer andsoundings had been taken of other major airlines in the rest of theworld.    My efforts to persuade German and French Ministers of thishave failed and, though I shall return to the point when I next meet them,I do not expect to get very far.    We may therefore have to decide for or against the A300B before we have firm indications of the market.7.       British European Airways (BEA) are unlikely to complete theirevaluation until July, but have already said that they will stronglyprefer the BAG 311.    A number of other airlines have also expressedan interest in this aircraft.American competition8.      We believe that Boeing are certain to enter this market, but willnot take a final decision until later this year.    Lockheed are in discussionwith both BAG and Sud Aviation, but we believe that the chances of theircollaboration with BAC are better.Finance9.      The consortium are seeking 100 per cent of the development cost( 170 million) from Governments, and are proposing recovery oversales of 360 aircraft.    We are most unlikely to sell this number.    TheBritish Governments share of this would be some  65 million, but thereis a possibility that some of this would be provided by the Germans underoff set funding arrangements,    Further negotiations are required toimprove the terms of the consortium offer if we can,10,      For the BAC 311, on the basis that it could be launched as a european project, with an Air France order as well as a BEA order,BAC proposed 75 per cent Government support of the development cost which they put at  100 million, with recovery over 250 aircraft..Herr Dohnanyi has made it clear to me that neither the French nor the-German Government will accept the BAC 311 as a European project.The effect of this is to invalidate the basis on which the BAG proposal

was made.    If we assume, as I think we must, that a purely Britishproject could not be fioanced0 the BAC 311 can be considered only whenthe Company&apos;s talks wish Lockheed enable them to put forward a proposal.This cannot be before the end of April at the earliest.11.       Our forward costings make no provision for either project atpresent.    The provision which had been made for the A300 was deletedlast December.Engine12.       The consortium have chosen the &quot;stretched&quot; version of the rb, 211 engine which Rolls-Royce have offered to Lockheed for the long-range version of the trijet aircraft, the L. 1011.    The consortiumhowever want to offer the American Pratt and Whitney engine as analternative to customers who prefer it.    This would reduce the attractions of the project for us, but there is a chance that we might beable to exclude the American engine.13.      A more real difficulty is the fact that Lockheed have not yet made up their minds about the &quot;stretched&quot; version of the RB.211, and that noarrangements for financing its development ha^e yet been made.    I amstill examining a request from Rolls-Royce for 50 per cent launching aid,amounting to some  20 million on present estimates.14.      The BAC 311 would initially use the current version of the rb.211 already being developed for the shorter range L. 1011.    They would however want to U3e the &quot;stretched&quot; version for later sales.Importance of the decision15.      If we decide against supporting the A300B, the French andGerman firms may still continue to use Hawker Siddeley, though perhaps in a considerably reduced role.    They will seek other EuropeanGovernment partners and possibly an association with an american aircraft firm.    It is unlikely that they will use the RB.211 engine, unless they succeed in reaching an agreement with Lockheed,16.      If we decide against the A300B, we should have a limited further period in which to decide whether to support the BAC 311.    Our decisions would depend on the availability of funds, on our view of the collaborativearrangements which BAC had made, and on the degree of airline interest.To preserve the chances of the BAC 311, it would be prudent for us tosay at the time that it was still a serious contender.17.      The decision will be a crucial one both for our Europeantechnology policy and for the aircraft industry.    There can however beno question of supporting either aircraft until we are reasonably assured that it will command a good market and measure up to our normaleconomic criteria for Government-aided projects.    The case for oneproject or the other must stand up in comparison with other claims forGovernment support.-3-

Conclusion18.      E my colleagues agree, I will accept the invitation o  the Frenchand German Governments to discuss the project with them.    My aimwill be to play for time by probing the possibilities of improving the consortium^ terms for Government support for the A300B and of aGerman offset contribution.19.      I invite my colleagues to take note of the current state of progress on a 250-seater aircraft project, and to note that I shall submit a further report after the discussions, which will be without commitment.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.17th March, 1969-4-
