Jty , CONFSDEtsSTJALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 43 COPY NO.2nd May, 1969CABINETTHE RELEASE OF OFFICIAL, INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductionAt their meeting on 21st March the Parliamentary committee considered a memorandum by the Prime Minister (0(69) 21) about therelease of official information.    The general feeling of the Committeewas that the Government wculd be unwise to set up an inquiry into thissubject, but that there might be advantage in publicising the Governmentsrecord in making information available, either in a White Paper or insome other form.    The Committee took no final decision on whether to publish a White Paper but asked me to consider what might be included.The Freedom of Publication (Protection) bill.      The Committee also asked me in consultation with the paymaster general to advise the Attorney General on what he should say about thismatter when the Freedom of Publication (Protection) Bill was debated inStanding Committee.    When this debate took place on 16th April, the attorney General explained that the Governments examination of the issues involved was now well advanced;  and that they intended to make astatement to Parliament about the matter shortly.    He also made itclear that the Official Secrets Acts, with which Clause 3 of the Bill was concerned, in no way limited a. Government from authorising the disclosure of information in any circumstances that it judged to be appropriate.    He urged the Committee to reject Clause 3 on the groundthat it would be wrong to throw open to argument in the courts thequestion whether or not the public interest was prejudiced in anyparticular case by the publication of official information,3.       The supporters of the Bill are using Clause 3 to advance theirargument that the terms of the Official Secrets Act are too wide and canbe used to prevent the publication of information which is embarrassing to the Government of the day, although not prejudicial to the publicinterest.    Mr. Eyre, the BillTs sponsor, offered to withdraw the Clause-1-CQSNIFJDE INITIAL

if a detailed statement on the inquiry now going on could be promised bythe end of April.    When this promise could not be made, he said&quot;.... I regretfully think it necessary for us to go forward with theClause, for possible review of the situation on Report.    There will beplenty of time for us all to have second thoughts.    I hope that the attorney General and the Prime Minister in particular will have secondthoughts, so that we know much more about the inquiry into official secrets .., . &quot; (Hansard, 16th April, Standing Committee C, columns 80-81).The Standing Committee agreed that Clause 3 should stand part of theBill.    The Report Stage of the Bill will take place on 16th May.    Becauseof the need to decide before then what action we should take so that the attorney General can be given a clear line to take in the House ofCommons, I am putting this question to my colleagues as a matter ofsome urgency.    There are, I suggest, three main courses open to theGovernment.The Possibility of a White Paper4.      The first course open is that in asking the House to rejectClause 3 Jhe Attorney General should undertake that the Government willpublish  within the next fortnight/a White Paper setting out our policy on the release of official information.    A draf&apos;- of such a White Paper isat Annex.5.      Such an undertaking should go a fair way to meet the supporters of the Bill.    But it would probably be desirable for the Attorney general to say that, although he did not wish to anticipate the content of the white paper, it v/ould show that the Government had carried out a full study ofall aspects of the question and that they were placing all the considerationsbefore Parliament.6.      It would also be desirable for the Attorney General to explain tothe House, as he did to the Standing Committee, the distinction which is drawn in paragraphs 4 to 7 of the draft White Paper between whatdisclosures should be authorised and what should be the consequences ofunauthorised disclosure.    He might go on to say that the release of moreofficial information by the Government required no amendment of theOfficial Secrets Acts;  that it would be unacceptable to allow anyone withaccess to official information to publish it as he thought fit; and that if at any time it was found that the Official Secrets Acts were preventingdisclosures which the Government would otherwise permit, then theGovernment would consider further a general review of the Acts.7.      Since its supporters evidently regard Clause 3 as a means of bringing pressure on the Government to make a substantive statement,this course should put the Government in a good position to force the deletion of the Clause as unacceptable.    We must, however, recognise the likelihood that thereafter the publication of the White Paper would leadto pressure for a further debate in either or both Houses.-2-CONFIDEMTIAL

The possibility of an oral statement of policy.      The second course would be to make an oral statement of theGovernments attitude to the Fulton recommendations for getting rid of unnecessary secrecy, outlining the principal points in the draft white paper at Annex and leaving other matters to be dealt with in answer to supplementary Questions.    The Parliamentary Committee in their discussion on 21st March touched upon the possibility of a statement byway of Question and Answer.9.      An oral statement would have the advantage of playing the whole matter in a lower key than woald a White Paper.    It is not certain that a white Paper setting out illustrations of the information that we havealready released about the work of Government, and an analysis of the considerations which affect the wider provision of this information, willmeet the main criticism  which we face.   This is,&quot; I suggest, that thePress should be free to publish any category of official informationexcept what it would be against the interests of national security to disclose; and that the blanket provisions of the Official Secrets Actsinduce an unnecessary atmosphere of secrecy.    Thj difficulty for theGovernment in attempting to answer these criticisms by way of a white paper is to avoid appearing to be reluctant or defensive in a policydocument, and so opening the way for unfavourable Press comment.The risk of such a reaction might be less if these matters were dealt withby way of Question and Answer,    On the other hand, it might well be feltthat an oral statement was a less substantial result of the Governmentsstudy than a White Paper.    My colleagues will wish to consider the tactics of this,    I suggest that if an oral statement of this kind is to bemade, it would be more helpful to have it just before rather than afterthe Report Stage of the Freedom of Publication (Protection) Bill,    Butin my view a statement in Parliament will not provide us with a satisfactory solution.The possibility of an outside inquiry10.      Finally, I think we ought to face the possibility that neither astatement nor the White Paper will satisfy the critics.    Although on thelast occasion we came to the view that an outside inquiry would be unwise,nonetheless I think we should be sure that we can resist renewed pressure for such an inquiry if this should develop.    I think we can fairly claim that we have carried out an extensive internal inquiry, as the draft white paper shows.    The arguments for and against an outside inquiry, eitherinto the whole question of the release of official information (includingthe Official Secrets Acts so far as they are relevant) or into the official secrets Acts alone, are worth reiterating.    On the one hand, eitherform of&quot; inquiry would no doubt placate - for the time being - the kind of criticism considered in the previous paragraph, though it does not seemessential to announce such an inquiry in order to kill Clause 3 of the bill before the House of Commons.-3-CO NFS DENTS AL

11.      On the other hand a general inquiry could well have an embarrassing outcome.    As the Parliamentary Committee have recognised, only the Government can decide what official informationcan be released without damage to the national interest.    An outsideinquiry into this question might well push the Government further thanthey are prepared to go, by seeking to establish new general principles to deal with cases which essentially ought to be considered on their merits; and by quoting cases in which the Government have, for good reasons, decided that it would not be in the public interest to volunteerinformation.12.       In favour of an inquiry confined to the working of the official secrets Acts alone, it might be argued not only that the Acts induce an unnecessary atmosphere of secrecy in Government processes but alsothat the extreme width of the pre pent law makes it virtually unenforceableby criminal sanction over a great part of the information field and thatthis tends to bring the law into disrepute.    Against this it can be said thatthe Acts ought to have no bearing on Departments&apos;1 day to day activity of releasing to the public, under proper authority, information about thework of Government; and that if they are found to hi inhibiting this theGovernment are prepared to look at the matter further.    If the criticsreally want everybody who has access to official information outside thefield of national security (however defined) to be allowed to publish it ashe thinks fit, we must answer frankly that we are not prepared to make that concession.13.       Moreover, since there is general acceptance that certain basicinterests of the State will always require some deterrent protection ofthe kind given by the Official Secrets Acts, the main purpose of an inquiry would presumably be to define with some precision the areas to which such protection should still apply.    I suggest that it would be very dangerous to launch an outside inquiry into this unless we have a clearidea where it might take us.    Supposing, for example, the protectionwere applied to defence, foreign policy, security and certain economic matters, is it likely that these could be defined with accuracy?   are there other policy areas which ought to be included?    Would theGovernment be content to leave to the courts the decision whichdisclosures in the defined areas would damage the national interest?And would not an inquiry ostensibly limited to the working of the official secrets Acts inevitably lead into the question how much should be disclosed about the decision making process, which we have concluded that only the Government can judge?Conclusion14.      *My colleagues will wish to choose between the three coursesdescribed above.    K we re-affirm our decision not to have an outsideinquiry we must be prepared to stand firmly by this in the face of what may be strong pressure to reverse it,-4-

15.       In the light of all the conoiderations, I recommend that we shouldtake our stand on an exposition of the Governments attitude towards the relevant passages in the Fulton Report, and that this should be expoundedin a White Paper rather than by an oral statement.    I believe that a white Paper is preferable because it allows us to set out more fully thearguments underlying our policyj  an oral statement, although it hasthe advantage that it could be made before the Report Stage of theFreedom of Publication (Protection) Bill, seems a barely adequatemeans of reporting the results of an inquiry into this subject.S.Civil Service Department, S.W.1,2nd May, 1969

AMEXDRAFT WHITE paper the Rel eas e-^^f^-cJ:al^Jnf^oj,mat i onInt^pjducJ^onIn their Report (cmnd.. 3638) the Pulton Committee on theCivil Service suggested that the administrative process wassurrounded by too much secrecy.   They v/elcomed the trend inrecent years towards wider and more open consultation hut pro-posed that there should he more of this, while&quot; recognising atthe same time 11 that there must always he an element of secrecy(not simply on grounds of national security) in administration and policy11.    Summing up this section of their Report(paragraphs 277-280) they suggested that the Government should set up an inquiry to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessary secrecy.2.     The Government decided that in order to make that inquirycomprehensive they should carry it out on a wide inter-departmental basis, examining what has been achieved in recentyears, and how far these new trends meet the agreed need to get rid of unnecessary secrecy.   The aim of the inquiry was not to lay down hard and fast rules on what could, in future, bepublished and what not, but rather to reinforce an increasinglyliberal attitude, with the bias in decision on individual cases in favour of openness rather than secrecy.3.     The inquiry found that the increasing trend towardsopenness in recent years had been expressed in two main forms.The first was an increase in the amount of factual informationnow being disclosed; the second a much greater frankness in publishing forecasts and other considerations involved in policy decisions.    &quot;Openness&quot; for its own sake is not the only relevantfactor, as- the Fulton Committee itself recognised.    This Papertherefore documents both the results of the inquiry on currenttrends and the other considerations which will always need tobe borne in mind.-1

The Of f iclal ^ecj^ete^Acisk.     The Fulton Committee suggested, that the Official secrets acts were a consideration of this kind.    In order to judge therelevance.of the Acts, it is necessary to consider their object.This is to prevent unauthorised persons from obtaining, whether as a result of the corruption or neglect of public servants orin some other way, information about official matters and thenmaking use of or disclosing such information.    In the debates on the Bills for the Acts (the first of which was passed in1911), emphasis was laid on the need to safeguard informationwhose disclosure would prejudice the safety of the State.    Itis, however, also necessary to prevent the disclosure of official information which neither affects the safety of theState nor involves State secrets of first class importance; andthe Official Secrets Acts were drawn up with that purpose too.5.    The Acts make it an offence to disclose or publishofficial information without authority.    It has sometimes beensuggested that their scope ought to be limited to those caseswhere national security is involved.    But apart from the very real difficulty of defining what categories of information should qualify for that special protection and what should not,and the fact that it would not be appropriate to leave it tothe courts to decide which disclosures would damage thenational interest and which would not, those who argue for amendment of the Official Secrets Acts tend to overlook that theActs are not relevant to the main issue of how much official information the Government should be prepared to disclose about their work.6.   It is not, as has been supposed, the sanction of theOfficial Secrets Acts which forms a bar to more openness inthe work of Government.    TherActs do not inhibit in any waythe authorised release of information by Departments; theyare concerned only with unauthorised disclosures,   the Actstherefore have no bearing on the Governments policy of author-ising the publication of more information, and this policydoes not require any amendment of the Acts.2

7.    It is the Government&apos;s view that the decision what toauthorise or what not to authorise &quot;for publication must rest with the Government.   This follows inescapably from theresponsibility which the Government, and no other authority,have to Parliament and to the public for the protection ofnational security, for the privacy of information supplied bycitizens for Government purposes only, and for the fair and effective conduct of public business generally.    The Governmentwould certainly not accept that anybody who has access to official information should be allowed to publish it or not as he thinks fit.Fojiegjaj^ts^^ i &amp;JP^li Z^^e^.iS.L2E?J.8.     Of the two main categories of information mentioned above in paragraph 3, the inquiry revealed that the most strikingdevelopment in recent years lay in the progress made in thesecond - the publication of forecasts and other considerations involved in policy decisions.    This is because whereas thefirst (the provision of factual information) is a well-establishments-shed process which is, admittedly, being carried much further than before, the second has involved the breaking of new ground,with great   potential benefit for the future    Some examples ofthis process now follov/.9.     On the general economic front, there has been a marked increase both in the publication of forecasts and other material related to policy decision and in the kind of consulta-tion with the different parts and interests of the communitywhich the Pulton Committee saw as desirable.    Some of this new development has been taking&apos;place in the last year, and wastherefore not available in time for assessment in the PultonReport.    One key example is the provision of much more informa-tion in relation to the Budget.    In the Financial Statementaccompanying the Budget of March 1968, the Chancellor publishedfor the first time the details of the economic assessment forthe ensuing 18 months on the basis of which the Budget had been constructed.   Taking this process further, the FinancialStatement published with the 1969 Budget viras restyled &quot;Financial3

Statement and Budget Report&quot;, and offered a much moreup-to-date and significant economic assessment than had beenprovided in previous years in the annual Economic Report.10.     A similar development has been taking place in theprovision of forward-looking assessments of public expenditure.The White Paper of January 1968 included a functional analysislooking two years ahead.    The White Paper of February 1969confirmed the assessments for 1968-69 and 1969-70 and includedfigures for 1970-71 .   More far-reaching proposals still were put forward by the Treasury on April 29th 1969 in a &quot;green paper&quot; - a form of publication introduced by this Government toset out for public discussion proposals intended to form thebasis for future Government decision and action.   This newGreen Paper: &quot;Public Expenditure: A New Presentation&quot; proposesamong other things that the Government should undertake to publish each autumn information on public expenditure for thecurrent and ensuing four years, thus making public for thefirst time the five year forward-look figures which have been an established part of internal Government information since1961.    It proposes also to include forecasts of public sectorreceipts as well as expenditure, and a number of other far-reaching changes all aimed at providing Parliament and thepublic with relevant information and guidance on the underlyingissues.11.      In the wider economic field, a Green Paper - &quot;The TaskAhead&quot; -- published by the Department of Economic Affairsearlier this year was widely recognised as informative,realistic and constructive.    In preparing this Paper for publication, the Department were able to use to the full the greatly increased facilities for informed consultation that have been developed with the National Economic development council.&quot;12.     Much more information is being made available about theeconomics and policies of the nationalised industries.   The1967 White Paper &quot;Economic and Financial Objectives of the nationalised Industries&quot; was a major step forward inh

communication &quot;between those responsible for these questions andthe public at large.    The Ministry of Power published white papers on Fuel Policy in 1965 and 1 S67 setting out in detail thefacts and considerations taken into account in forming theGovernment&apos;s policy.13.    There are many other examples of the way in which theGovernment have made available far more than ever before theinformation on which future policy is based.    There have beenGreen Papers on the regional employment premium, the reorganisa-tion of the health service, speed limits and highways strategy.The Department of Employment and Productivity have just published a report on the implications of a national minimum wage, themost recent of a series of surveys of problems in the employmentfield.1 k.    In other fields, too, consultation takes place on the basisof information provided by the Government before policy decisions are reached.    Before a decision is taken on the siting of a new town, it is customary to publish a report byplanning consultants setting out the reasons for choosing the site, and to hold a public inquiry.    A decision on a majorcontroversial water scheme is usually preceded by a WaterResources Board report analysing the need for more water and thevarious ways of meeting it.    In both cases, therefore, public discussion before the decision is taken can go forward on aninformed basis.15.    Much has been done also in areas where wide public discussion can be supplemented and assisted by close Governmentconsultation with the people most concerned.   A good example ofthis is the regional planning machinery considerably developedby the present Government to increase public participation in policy making in the regions.    &quot;Wales: the Way Ahead&quot; is onlyone of the publications which has resulted from this.   Anotherexample is&apos;the Advisory Committees of the Department of health and Social Security, one of whose functions is seeing that the interested public are made aware of proposed policy changes and their views taken into account; for instance, the National5

Insurance Advisory Committee consider proposed new regulations and more general topics referred to them; they advertiseinviting representations; and their reports are published.16.   The Government&apos;s Children&apos;s and Young Persons Billillustrates very well how prior public discussion of proposed legislation can work and how the Government mean to continuewhenever practicable.    In August 1965 the Government presented a White Paper, ,:The Child, the Family and the Young Offender&quot;as a basis for discussion.    In April 1968 a new White Paper,&quot;Children in Trouble&quot; took account of the discussion of theearlier White Paper and made new proposals.    The Bill now before Parliament was based on the second White Paper but took account of further points which had been made on these laterproposals.17.    It does not follow, however, that public consultation on tentative proposals is always the right course.    Itgenerally results in slower decisions and slower action, and sometimes prompt action is essential; sometimes, too, conflict-ing views and conflicting interests are already well known,  andwith no prospect of pleasing everyone the Government have tomake their choice and stick by it.    In such cases a prolonged period of consultation will merely impose delay without anycompensating advantages.   For these reasons, although this typeof consultation does provide a valuable means of testing publicopinion before the Government are committed to a particularpolicy, and may even in some cases be an essential part of the democratic process, the Government do not think it desirable or practicable to make a firm rule to publish an analysis ofthe considerations involved in every policy decision before itis reached.    Indeed, some policies have been submitted to the electorate and fully debated in public as part of the democratic process before the Government which proposes to giveeffect to-them takes office.    So although the Government intendthat the prior publication of information about the considera-tions involved in policy matters should form a continuing partof the decision-making process, the judgment how much is to be

published - and when - in each field of Government activitywill depend on the circumstances of each case rather than onthe establishment of new general principles.Factual and StatgjjgjgicjjgJSaterial18.   As mentioned above in paragraph 5, the process of publishing factual information has continued along more familiarlines; but here too there have been developments which offer a healthy base for further welcome progress towards &quot;openness&quot;.19.    The increase in the amount of information about the waythe Services operate which has been given in recent defence white Papers has been most striking.    The Ministry of Technologyhave published a series of pamphlets describing their general policies, organisation and work, and a monthly bulletin for industry, &quot;New Technology&quot;.   The Ministries of Defence and technology also disseminate more widely than ever beforeinformation on the work of their research establishments throughannual and special reports, Open Days, broadcasting;  films andexhibitions.20.   A key development in the statistical field has been there organisation of the Central Statistical Office with the aimnot merely of providing more - and more up-to-date - figures,but also of expounding the methods used in this swiftly develop-ping service to provide information which will be of value notmerely to the Government itself but to industry and thecommunity at large.   A new publication &quot;Statistical News&quot; hasexplained these aims.   As a practical example of what can bedone, it published recently a statement of the work done by theMinistry of Power in constructing an integrated mathematicalmodel of the energy economy.    Many individual Departments havealso greatly expanded their former provision of statistical information and reports.21.   The Agriculture Departments have expanded their white papers on the Price Review, and have issued Papers on the structure of farming and the agricultural implications of theCommon Market.   The Annual Report of the Department of Education7

and Science is now supplemented by monthly reports whichrecently explained, for example, school building programmes andteacher supply projections,    A new series of science bulletinshas just been launched and a series of Science Policy studieshas been published for tho Council for Scientific Policy.Education statistics, starting with the first volume of the1968 figures, will contain explanations of the main trends theyimply.22.   Another example is that the Ministry of Health and social security has begun to publish a Quarterly(i;Health Trends11) for national Health Service doctors, and is about to issue a newannual digest of Health and Welfare Statistics.    These examples are echoed in the activity of many Departments and Governmentorganisations which not only publish regular formal reports,but have also begun to develop more informal factual bulletins,such as departmental &quot;newspapers&quot;.23.    Supplementing this statistical work, and often transcendingit in range, is the material provided for and published bySelect Committees of the House of Commons on the organisation,work and procedures of Departments in the areas under examination.   The increase in Select Committees has led to aconsiderable expansion of this work.2k.    The Government believe that there is scope for increasingthe trend towards publishing more material.    Two main factorswill, however, bear upon it.25.   First, the preparation of official material for publica-tion calls for much staff time, especially when research isrequired.    There would no doubt be public criticism if a decisionto increase greatly the quantity of what is published led to arise in Civil Service numbers.   The Government therefore takethe view that an increase in the publication of factual materialshould be developed gradually in areas where there is known tohe a substantial public interest in tho subject, and where the extra work can be. undertaken without either an unacceptableincrease in staff or a diversion of effort from the main job.8

Secondly, there will inevitably he circumstances in which,although public requests are made for certain factual informa-tion, its release either would not he in the general publicinterest at all or will need to be deferred, for example:-(i) where the information affects national security.    this may include economic information as well as defence and foreign policy matters;(ii) where the information is not vital to national security, but its disclosure would hamper the attain-ment of the Government&apos;s objectives.   This coversfields which it is not practicable to define compre-hensively, but which include those situations in which an element of negotiation is involved, as well as anumber of procedural matters such.as the way in whichthe Inland Revenue conduct enquiries into tax evasion;(iii) where the premature disclosure of information, forexample, Budget details, would enable those wholearned of it to make money or otherwise benefit atthe expense of others;(iv) where information has been given to the Government in confidence by individuals about their own affairs orby firms in answer to enquiries.These categories are not exclusive; they overlap with one another to some extent.   In all of them there is an element of timing.    Information may be disclosed after the operation towhich it relates is over: it may have to be withheld for verymuch longer:  or, as in the case of tax affairs of individuals,it may never be disclosed at all.Policy Determination26.   Another relevant consideration is the governmentalprocess in.policy formulation.   The course of the discussionwithin the -Government organisation itself which leads to adecision is not a proper subject for disclosure.   The different views which might be expressed between Ministers or officials in any particular case would no doubt bo of considerable9

interest if they became public knowledge at the time.    But it is against the wider public interest that they should become public knowledge at the time, because this would cut across the collective Ministerial responsibility on which our system ofCabinet Government rests and would hamper effective government.The Fulton Committee referred to this in paragraph 279 of theirReport, where they said:-&quot;We recognise that there must always be an element of secrecy (not simply on grounds of national security)in administration and policy-making.   At the formativestages of policy-making civil servants no less thanMinisters should be able to discuss and disagree among themselves about possible courses of action, withoutdanger of their individual views becoming a matter ofpublic knowledge; it is difficult to see how on anyother basis there can be mutual trust between colleagues and proper critical discussion of different hypotheses&quot;.Civil^S^ryantsi and the Public27.    The Fulton Committee suggested that &quot;civil servants&quot;should be able to go further than now in explaining what their departments are doing, at any rate so far as concerns managingexisting policies and implementing legislation&quot;.    They addedthat they do not &quot;underestimate the risks involved in such achange&quot; and said that it would be best &quot;left to developgradually and pragmatically&quot;.28.    It has in fact long been the practice for civil servants to explain the work of their Departments, and also to describeGovernment policy, to House of Commons Select Committees, tobodies representative of particular sections of the community and to individual firms or members of the public.    In manycases what they have had to say has been subsequently published.The information officers of Government Departments are particularly concerned with explaining Government policy, and where necessary Government organisation, to the public as their full-time work.    In addition, senior civil servants concerned10

with implementing and advising on policy have increasinglytaken part in interviews with the press and on radio and television, and have spoken at public conferences and othermeetings.    Particularly in those Departments which have local offices, it is common practice for officers to acceptinvitations to describe at meetings of local organisationsparticular policies and procedures and the main reasons for them.This trend is likely to continue.   And the names and appoint-ments of particular officials working in the different branchesof Government Departments, corresponding to the -main divisions of policy, are readily ascertainable from published works ofreference.29.    It will, however, be necessary to ensure that further developments on these lines do not prejudice the confidentialbasis of the relationship between Ministers and their officials.The risk must be avoided of officials becoming personallyidentified with a particular line of advice on a particularissue of policy (with the corollary that they should be free to disclose in what respects their advice had not been accepted by ministers),    It is right that officials should not be drawn intoexpressing personal views on policy matters which could berepresented as in conflict with those of their Ministers, or as reflecting any political bias.    The main responsibility forexplaining policy to Parliament and the public must continue torest with Ministers.    Subject to these considerations, theGovernment welcome increased participation of civil servants inthe task of explaining the work and organisation of Governmentto the public and agree with the view of the Pulton Committeethat this should be allowed to develop gradually and pragma-tically.Conclusion30.   The.Government agree with the Fulton Committee in wishing tosee more public explanation of administrative processes, a continuing trend towards more open consultation before policy decisions are reached, and increasing participation by civil11CONFIDENTIAL

servants in explaining the work of Government to the public.They intend to continue with these developments along thelines set out in this White Paper.
