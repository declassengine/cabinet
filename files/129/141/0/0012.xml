DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYtS GOVERNMENT)C(69) 37 COPY NO.       ^15th April, 1969CABINETPARLIAMENT (NO. 2) bill memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet invited me on 3rd April to arrange for the ministerial Committee on the House of Lords to consider after14th April the progress made on the Parliament (No. 2) Bill and toreport our conclusions to the next meeting of the Cabinet(CC(69) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.      The Ministerial Committee considered this question this morning and agreed that there are only two real choices now open to theGovernment - to introduce a guillotine or to drop the Bill.    It became clear from last nightrs failure to obtain the closure that even those ofour own Party who support the Bill are not enthusiastic enough to staylate in order to secure our majority, and to complete the BiTPs passage through the House of Commons under the present arrangements wouldrequire upwards of 20 days, in addition to the eight and a half which havealready been spent in Committee.    An important factor has been theattitude of the Opposition front bench, who have given no support to theproposals which were agreed with them and are not providing the usual channels through which a voluntary timetable could be agreed.3.      The Opposition have been asked whether they would co-operate with the Government in a guillotine motion, for example to the extenr of agreeing to issue only a two line whip against it, but they have said theywill not do so.    The Chief Whip^s advice is therefore that theGovernment could not carry a guillotine motion without exceptional measures, and it could be secured only if the Prime Minister were togive it the full weight of his authority and use the Bill as an occasion onwhich to reassert his own and the Governments leadership of the Party.The motion would then be treated as a matter of confidence and thePrime Minister would personally have to present it as such to theParliamentary Labour Party with all its implications and a clear statement of the Governments intention to proceed with legislation which&quot; they believe to be in the interest of the Party, of Parliament and.1-

of the Nation.    We can see no other means by which the reform of theHouse of Lords could be secured: to send the Bill upstairs or to postponeit to the next session would not improve the prospects of its passage, andwe have already recognised that a new Bill which was more acceptable to the Party could not be passed in the present Parliament.4.      The only alternative to a guillotine is therefore to drop the Bill.To do so would cause some relief in the Parliamentary Labour Party,not only amongst its declared opponents, but also amongst others whosee it as an obstacle to other essential legislation.    There would however be jubilation amongst the Opposition and the decision would inevitably be represented as a sign of the Governments weakness.It must be remembered that the Government has so far won all the substantive divisions by substantial majorities;  that it would be failing to implement pledges which were given in the election manifesto, in twospeeches from the Throne, and in the Prime Minister&apos;^ statement of20th June, 1968;  and that the indefensible characteristics of the presentHouse of Lords, including the permanent Conservative hereditarymajority, would continue unchanged.    Such a decision would altsoencourage the opponents of other controversial legislation to adoptsimilar tac&apos;ics.    For these reasons it would be necessary to presentthe decision as part of a wider reappraisal of our Parliamentarystrategy, and the Government should have to make clear that the reasonwas not that we had succumbed co pressure but thai; we were taking a newdirection and felt bound to make way for new and mere importantmeasures.    The Industrial Relations Bill would be an obvious example&quot;but since that Bill will be eqnally unwelcome to some of our supporters,others 3hould be quoted as well.    The decision should be announcedquickly and firmly, and should be fully and authoritatively explained tothe Parliamentary Labour Party,5.      We must recognise that any decision to abandon the Bill wouldhave unpalatable consequences for the management of government business in the House of Lords,    I attach a copy of a letter from the leader of that House which gives his assessment in some detail.    Wecannot rule out the possibility that the Lords might threw out aGovernment Bill - the Ports Bill for example - and we must face the probability that they would insist on more amendments or on postponingcertain measures, and that they would adopt more aggressive tacticsgenerally, for example by insisting on the proper intervals between thestages of Bills sent to them tov/ards the end of the session.    They might also reject subordinate legislation, including the special procedureorders on which I believe the Minister of Transport will rely for implementing the Pcrts Bill,    More generally, we shall have encouraged the Lords to feel that they are secure from any retribution from theHouse of Commons in this Parliament, and the Government might loseits freedom of manoeuvre in deciding the date of the next GeneralElection,-2-

6.      We therefore invite our colleagues to decide whether theGovernment should reassert their authority and the Prime Minister^leadership of the Party by insisting on the passage of a guillotine motion,or whether they should drop the Bill with all the consequences whichwould follow.    Whichever decision is taken., we would stress the needfor a speedy announcement and suggest that the Prime Minister shouldtake an early opportunity to inform the Party in the way suggested andthat a decision should be announced in the House of Commons the same afternoon.G.House of ijords, S.W.1.15th April, 1969-3-

annex copy of letter, dated .15th April 1969from theLord Privy Seal to. the^o^^ha^c^lljor*      *      *      *I have been thinking over what night happen if we decided to drop theBill, particularly from tho point of view of the House of Lords and the government&apos;s legislative programme in that House.     There is at presenta great deal of irritation in the Lords about tho way the Bill has boontreated in the House of Commons, and this irritation will be increased iftho Bill is dropped.     There will be a temptation to &quot;got back at&quot; the commons in ways which in the long run can only be irritating and perhapsdamaging to all concerned.     As for the parties, our own supporters will inevitably lose heart and our opponents will be strengthened by theknowledge that even a Labour Government as committed as this one has failed to carry its reform through the Commons.     The prospect of anyreform must inevitably become noro remote, and tho restraint which either the Government or the Conservative leadership can apply will therefore be weakened.     The result must be that we will have markedly less controlover the Lords for the remainder of this parliament than has ever beon thecase in the past.     Finally, the Conservative leadership - especiallyCarrington - are bound to suffer some further loss of authority by the defeat of the proposals of which they wore such active protagonists.     Intho resulting climate of opinion they too will be almost bound to harassthe Government, and to take advantage of every sign that its authority is threatened.This brings me to the question of the means they would use to harassthe Government.     I do not suppose that the Conservative leadership hero willnot go so far as to press for the wholesale rejection of Government bills,

although wo cannot rule out the possibility that they might reject the PortsBill (or the bill to abolish feudal dues in Scotlandl).   But I think it&apos;unlikely that men as sensible as Carrington or Jellicoe would allow theirmajority to carry them into the division lobby against the essentiallegislation on for example industrial relations.   They feel increasinglysure that they are going to be the next government and they will wish tosee this legislation on the Statute Book, knowing how useful it will beto them and the price which the Labour Government will have to pay.Similarly, I do not see them voting to reject outright either the pensionsplan or the bill to nationalise the docks.   They might, however, insist on amendments which would carry out Conservative policy and for which there might be considerable popular support in the country, e.g. lower the levelof compulsion in the case of the trade union legislation, or they mightvote to postpone the implementation of the pension scheme so that theirown administration could modify it in a way which would permit a more advantageous bargain for the private pension schemes than has been offered.They might similarly insist on postponing the legislation on ports, andthis might mean that the legislation would never come into effect in this parliament,   I think we must also recognise that they could cause U3 greatdifficulty by ceasing to extend their unofficial co-operation in the passingof legislation.   They could, for example, insist on the proper intervalsbetween the stages of bills sent to them towards the end of the session,and if bills were to reach the Lords late they could refuse to sit inAugust and insist on a long spill-over in the autumn:   we might then be obliged either to postpone the date for the general election or sacrificethe legislation concerned.We could face a similar situation on subordinate legislation.   here again I think they would be very careful after the experience on the Southei-nRhodesia Order last year, although the annual renewal of the present legis-lation could in certain circumstances be a temptation. But if we weretogofor-ward with subordinate legislation of tho Stanstod kind,I -think Ihero is no doubt-2-SECRET

at all that they would reject it if they thought it was unpopular in thecountry.     A further possibility would be to cause delays - for example in the case of hybrid special orders or on special procedure orders.     Asregards special procedure orders you will remember that the Minister ofTransport placed considerable reliance on these in relation to the dockslegislation;   I think Ministers who hope to make use of such subordinate legislation might need to think again about this way of proceeding since in the absence of a reform of composition and powers any controversialorder would clearly stand at risk in this House.A further point of difficulty is likely to be the resolution to prolongthe Abolition of Death Penalty Act of 1965.     You may have heard that theHouse authorities construe the Act as meaning that a resolution undersection 4 could be amended to prolong the Act for a term of years only.I think the Conservative leadership in this House would be under strong pressure to bring forward an amendment to the Government resolution to prolong this measure in such a way as to do so for only, say, anotherfive years.     They would then seem politically to get the best of bothworlds:   they could say that there had not been enough time to see theresults of the Act and they could nevertheless ally themselves with publicopinion in a way which could be very damaging to the Government.I would not wish to suggest that the Conservative leadership wouldbe politically so inept a3 to create a situation in which a &quot;showdown&quot;was possible.     I think they would choose their battle fields with great care, and not create a situation in which a conflict of peers versus thepeople might rally support for an otherwise &quot;unpopular&quot; Government.But the Southern Rhodesia vote in the Lords last year shows that theycould have caused us great trouble and indeed it is possible that theycould engineer a situation in which we had to go to the country withcertain legislation incomplete.     We should not forget the situation ofthe Tories in their last year and what a Tory House of Lords might do if,for example, we were to bring forward some unmandated legislationsimilar to Heath1 s Retail Price Maintenance Measure.-3-

There is only one other point I would make.     Whenever someonesuggests that the Lords might cause real difficulties to a LabourG-overnment, the reaction is usually a comfortable &apos;so much the worsefor them&apos;.     In the light of the above, no attitude could be moremisconceived.*      *      *      *-4-SECRET
