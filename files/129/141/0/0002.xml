C(69) 27 COPY NO. jj jj17th March, 1969CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the Minister of technology the V/ork so farConcorde has now been under development for a little over six years.    The first prototype has flown, and has now embarked on the flight test programme;  the second prototype is expected to fly withinthe next month or two.    Work on the two pre-prodxiction aircraft is well advanced, and v/ork on the first three production aircraft, which willalso be used during the later stages of the flight test programme, has begun.The Tests to be done2.      Results from sustained flight at supersonic cruising speeds arenot now expected to be achieved before the middle of 1970.    The firms have said publicly that their target is to obtain a certificate of airworthiness at the end of 1972 and to have enough production aircraftdelivered to certification standards for airlines to start service in 1973.officials estimate is that the firms are unlikely to achieve certificationbefore 1973 and that the most probable date is between December, 1973and June, 1974.The Latest Concorde Directing Committee Report3.       The latest report (Annex A) to British and French Ministers bythe Concorde Directing Committee is disturbing and reveals a deterioration in the situation since the project was last considered by the Cabinet.4.       The present position can be summarised as follows.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

Payload/Rang;e Performance5.       Assuming that the important design changes proposed by the firms (new shapes of wing leading edges, wing tips, and rear fuselage,and changes in engine design) are approved, officialsr estimatesindicate a payload of about 15, 000 lb. at entry into service as comparedwith the target payload on initial entry into service for the Paris/New Yorksummer design mission of 20, 000 lb.    The firmst calculations on theother hand lead to a payload of 26, 000 lbs. and they would not admit to anything less than 205 0 0 0 lbs. even allowing for the correction of anyfaults revealed by flight testing.    The development programme is now so far advanced that if there should be any further deterioration in theprospects of achieving target payload, there remains little more that could be done short of a major redesign.    The shortfall, officialsconsider, could be restored by minor changes to operational procedure(speed and holding altitude) and by a slight reduction (less than 1 per cent)in regularity of service.    Provided the aircraft were acceptable in other respects, these changes should be acceptable to. the airlines.    the basic estimate, however, of 15, 000 lb, is itself subject to considerable uncertainty (plus or minus about 8, 000 lb. ) which cannot be reducedsubstantially before June, 1970 when results should be available fromsustained flight of the prototype at supersonic cruise speed.    Officials1present estimates of payload thus cover a bracket which at its higherend would lead to the conclusion that Concorde will be a technical and commercial success (provided other factors are in its favour) but whichat its lower end would lead to the conclusion that, even if other factorswere favourable, Concorde would be a technical and commercial failure.Airfield Noise6.       The target for Concordets airfield noise is that it shall be no greater than noise from current civil jet aircraft.    Officials&quot;1 currentassessment of airfield noise on entry into service is as follows;Approach noise is likely to be about 5 Perceived Noise Decibels(PNdB) lower than that of the Boeing 70? or Douglas DC 8.Lateral noise on take-off will almost certainly be higher thanthat of existing airliners - the most likely figure being about PNdB higher.Flyover noise immediately after take-off on some hot days in summer is likely to be about 2 to 3 PNdB above the levelscurrently permitted at New York or London.(For purposes of comparison 3 to 4 PNdB is about the smallest difference in noise that can be detected by the human ear).Thus (he noise situation remains a source of serious concern.We must bear in mind that even if we in Britain found the noise tolerable,Concorde could be banned from operating from United States airports.The strength of the anti-noise lobby plus the structure of the United StatesGovernment could make it difficult even for representations at thehighest level to succeed.

7.      The firmed assessment of the noise situation is more optimisticthan that of officials.    The margins of uncertainty in the currentestimates should be progressively reduced throughout 1969? asmeasurements from the prototypes inflight are assessed there shouldbe a substantial reduction in the uncertainty by mid-1969.Development Gogts8.      In June, 1968 the CDC reported that their basic estimate ofthe costs for the extramural development programme was  530 million at January, 1966 prices.    To this they added contingencies of up to 150 million, giving a total of  680 million.    Their latest estimate,including provision for the important design changes proposed by the firms, is at January, 1966 prices  596 million to  680 million.Converted to January, 1969 prices, this estimate becomes 727 million to  841 million of which about  310 million ( 168 million by the United Kingdom firms) will have been spent by 31st March, 1969.Remaining expenditure by United Kingdom firms within the basicestimate of  727 million (the additional contingency allowance of 114 million which makes up the total of  841 million is not allocatedseparately between the United Kingdom and French firms) is estimated to be  171 million.Attitude of the Airlines9.      Different airlines have different attitudes.    The British aircraft corporation (BAG) say that Pan American Airways expect to order atleast 20 Concordes and are said to be confident that they can make areasonable profit on Concorde operation.    British Overseas airways corporation (BOAC) on the other hand, say that the studies they have carried out so far suggest that irrespective of the route operated,Concorde is likely to worsen their financial position.    BOAC howeverhave not yet completed their assessments.    Studies moreover by an outside consultant suggest chat BOAC should be able to operate Concordeprofitably.    And if their American competitors operate Concorde,BOAC will clearly also wish to do so.Selling Price10,       Officials&apos;&apos; latest estimate is that, if the manufacturers are tomake a profit on production and the two Governments are to secure a modest recovery on their investment in development, the price for a production run of 100 aircraft will have to be not less than $24 million at 1968 prices.    This estimate is, however, very tentative and is boundto remain so until there is a final production specification.    E fewer than 100 aircraft are produced the celling price will need to be increased and cpnversely, if more than 100 aircraft are produced, the selling price would be lower.    In the end, however, the determining factor in settingthe selling price will be what the market will bear and that, in the worstcircumstances, might mean subsidising manufacture.-3-

Economic prospects11.       The market prospects for Concorde have been re-assessed inthe light of the delay in the likely in-service date, the fetback to theUnited States Supersonic transport (SST) programme, and a postulatedselling price of $24 million at 1968 prices.    Uncertainties surroundeach of these factors.    If, for example, the United States Administrationdecided not to proceed with (heir SST this would be bound to affectConcordeTs prospects, posing certain difficulties but at the same timeremoving its main competitor.12,      Given the uncertainties, any market assessment is bound to betentative, and any estimates must be presented as a range ofpossibilities.(a) Assuming that Concorde*s technical performance is satisfactory,that the price of $24 million is held and is acceptable to airlines, andthat supersonic flying overland is allowed over sparsely populated areas,the current estimate is that betv/een 70 and 140 Concordes could be sold in the period up to 1980.    BACe estimate of sales is substantially higher.(b) Assuming a restriction on all overland supersonic flying, thiswould reduce the range of possible sales to 60 and 115.    The firmsTestimate on the same assumption about overland supersonic flyingis 250.13.      There is a higher chance that the figure will be either relatively small or relatively large than that it will be a figure somewhere near the middle of the range.14.       On the assumption that all expenditure up to 1st April, 1969 isignored, the prospects in terms of implied preference for foreign exchange are as given in the table below.    Two alternative impliedpreferences are given for each sales level.    The lower result relates to a development cost estimate of  600 million at 1966 prices, the higherto an estimate of  680 million at 1966 prices.Balance of Payments BenefitsNumber ofPartial boomrestrictionFull boomrestrictionaircraft sold( 70( 140Undiscounted     Discounted( 60( 115400970330830 m.275525240435ImpliedPreference%43-6515-2852-7720-35The firmsT assessments, which officials do not consider to be realistic,of 250 sales would if achieved produce the following benefits;-(250 1832 834 5-13-4-

The present financial position15.      The total United Kingdom share of Concorde extramural develop-ment costs of  727 million at current prices is now estimated at 340 million at current prices, of which close on  170 million will havebeen spent by 31st ft/larch, 1969.    E Concorde were cancelled at that dateadditional cancellation costs would probably amount to between 20 million and  30 million.    Assuming that there is no furtherescalation in the basic estimate of  340 million, cancellation on31st March would therefore imply a saving of between  140 million and 150 million, to which should be added about  15 million of outstandingintramural development costs.    1  we continue to 31st December, 19&amp;9we shall spend a further  42 million to  43 million on extramuraldevelopment plus  2 million to  3 million on intramural development and  10 million on production:  say  55 million in all.    Cancellationat 31st December, 1969 would thus imply a net saving of between 100 million and  110 million.16.      We have always recognised that if we were to cancelunilaterally the French might take action against us in the international court, and that the Court might award substantial damages against us.The latest advice from the Atfc orney-General is that this is still a realpossibility if we were to withdraw before the &quot;criterion&quot; date of31st December, 1969 (see paragraph 24 below).    If we cancelled on31st March, 1969, and damages were awarded against us on the basisof the cost to the French of completing the project on their own, then the damages could be the full amount of the outstanding United kingdom share of the development cost, i. e. some  170 million ( 196 million ifintramural costs be included).    K alternatively damages were awardedon the basis of reimbursement to the French of the costs they hadalready incurred then the total would be a little lower - about 150 million (though French cancellation costs could be additional to this).Production Programme17.       The only authority which the firms have at present is for themanufacture of the first three aircraft, which will be used in the flighttest programme.    The Concorde Directing Committee has asked the firms to study a number of alternative programmes;  the earliestassumes that limited authority to start production is given within thenext few months;  the latest that no further authority is given until an assessment has been made of performance at supersonic cruisingspeed.    Officials consider that the second of these alternatives wouldinvolve a delay in starting production until the end of 1970,    H theprogramme continues, decisions on production will need to be takenwithin the next few months.    If production is slowed down, redundanciesof 1,&apos;500 in Bristol could follow within the next few months,-5-

Production Financing18.      The current estimate of the working capital required forConcorde production in the United Kingdom is  120 million, but this figure must remain tentative until the production programme hasbeen decided.    The banks will lend up to  25 million with a Govern-ment guarantee, and the Government will lend the rest.    In additionup to  30 million will be required for special capital assets.    Wehave also accepted that the Companies should be indemnified incertain circumstance &amp; against the liability to repay the money and against losses on production.    The sums at risk could be considerable.The House was warned at the time of the Industrial Expansion Bill(Official Pveport, 13th March, 1968, Col. 1547) that in the extremecircumstances of a catastrophe to the project at a late stage theGovernments total liability on production could amount to 200 million.-6-

19.       The negotiations with the United Kingdom companies suggest thatthere is little possibility of persuading thern to accept the risk of losses on the first 100 aircraft.    The only scheme which at this stage seems tobe negotiable is one in which the companies would receive a minimumreturn on capital employed, although one substantially below thestandard for non-risk rate for Government contracts, even if theparticular aircraft batch or production programme as a whole resultedin a loss to the Government,The Criteria agreed with M, Chamant20,      Following the Cabinet&apos;s decision of August last (CC(68) 37thConclusions, Minute 3), I accepted, with my colleagues&apos; agreement(CC(68) 44th Conclusions, Minute 4), the proposals made byM. Chamant, the French Minister of Transport, on the criteriaon development costs and firm orders against which the future ofthe Concorde project could be determined.     The exchange of lettersbetween M. Chamant and myself is at Annex B021,       The agreement reached with M. Chamant provides for activecontinuation of the project until the second half of 1969 and the agreedcriteria on orders and development costs are tied to the end of 1969,This date was chosen because it was anticipated that by that timeinformation on the performance of Concorde flights at Mach 2(i. e, twice the speed of sound:  1, 520 m. p. h. ) would be available.This information will not now be available before June, 1970,22.      The criterion on development costs provides (paragraph 2(d))that, in the event of the estimated development costs at the end of1969 being more than  600 million in January, 1966, conditions,M. Chamant and I will propose to our respective Government ar.amendment to the. Memorandum of Understanding of 1962 releasingeach Government from any automatic obligation to continue the project jointly.    We have now for all practical purposes reached this &quot;criterion&quot; figure.    It cennot, however, be invoked in accordancewith the agreement with M. Chamant until the end of 1969.    Theagreement does, however, provide (paragraph 3) for me to considerthe situation with M, Chamant should the Concorde Directing committee at any time up to the end of 1969 consider, as they now do, that there isno longer any hope of maintaining the development costs below the limit of  600 million in January, 1966, conditions.Possible Courses of Action&quot;23.      In accordance with paragraph 3 of the agreement, I must nowdiscuss with M, Chamant what our two Governments should do.    Inthese discussions there are, I suggest, tv/o possible objectives thatI should have in mind:

(i)  To seek to cancel now, with or without the agreement of theFrench,(ii)  To follow the procedure implicit in the Agreement between, Chamant and myself and, whilst making clear our deep concernover recent developments, and our doubts as to the projects chances of achieving technical and commercial success, to review the projectat the end of 1969.Course No, 1.24.      Although the French wish to keep production commitments to theminimum until mid-1970, they have shown no indication of wishing towithdraw from the project,    I do not consider that there is any chanceof persuading the French to agree that we should cancel the project now.Their position, with which I agree, is that the aircraft should be given a chance to prove itself.    Although we have already in effect reachedthe criterion figure of  600 million at January, 1966, prices, the Frenchcan fairly argue that the Chamant agreement commits both governments to &quot;active continuation&quot; of the project until the second half of 1969 andthat this governs the operation of the criteria.     The advice of the attorney-General is that the fact that we have already reached the 600 million figure, at January, 1966, prices, does not, in the lightof what was agreed with M, Chamant, now entitle us to withdrawunilaterally.    As regards the possibility of withdrawing unilaterallyon the grounds of a fundamental change of circumstances, the attorney-General considers that, if the French took us to theInternational Court, we would have a respectable case and a stronger one than we have had hitherto.    But on the present state of the evidence his assessment of our chances before theInaternational Court is that, if we withdraw at this stage, we wouldhave rather less than a fifty-fifty chance of success.25.      Since Concorde was last reviewed by the Cabinet eight months ago (C(68) 90), a great deal of further development work has been done;the first Concorde prototype has flown successfully;  and the critical period, when the flight test programme will demonstrate whether ornot it will prove a technical and commercial success, has now started.It would, in my view, be wrong to seek to cancel now,    Apart from therisk of substantial damages being awarded against us in the Inter-national Court, there are the following additional arguments against taking an irrevocable decision before the project has had a chance to prove itself one way or the other:-(i) It would remove the possibility of earning large foreign exchange benefits,Or*0 *&quot;*

(ii) It would do serious damage to our standing as an advancedindustrial society and our credibility as a partner in inter -national projects.    As such, it would be a major blow to theprospects for European technological collaboration to strengthen our ties with Europe.(iii) It would disrupt the great assembly of resources and skills nowdevoted to the project and would have widespread consequences for the skills, the standing and the morale of the aircraft industry as a whole.(iv) Annex C contains an analysis of the industrial consequences of cancellation.    This could lead to a loss, in the short termof 7,000-12,000 jobs in Bristol in BAC and the Bristol EngineDivision of Rolls-Royce;  elsewhere the problems would be ona smaller scale.    In terms of industrial organisation, 3AC&apos;sBristol Division would be unlikely to survive and a drasticreconstruction of the whole firm would be required.    In general,equipment sub-contractors would not be badly hit, although afew specialist firms might be.    But this is to underrate thegeneral and long-term effects,,    We should be giving up theonly major advanced technological project in which we havea world lead, and inflicting a blow to morale which would have repercussions far beyond the confines of the aircraft industry.(v) We would face a difficult political situation.    A climate ofopinion has now been created in which both the firms andthe public accept that the future of Concorde will be determinedby whether its flight trials are a success or not.    Acancellation coming shortly after the first flight wouldbe extremely difficult to defend.     The firms would argue that Concorde was on the road to success and the balanceof technical argument is such that we could not easily refutethem.    We would be accused of having lost our nerve when theprizes of success were still within our grasp and before we havegiven the aircraft a chance to prove itself.For these reasons I cannot recommend this course.Course No. 2.26.      If we stand by the criterion agreed with M. Chamant and if atthat time we wished to withdraw, M. Chamant would be bound at theend of 1969 by virtue of the fact that the criterion figure of  600 million at January, 1966, prices had been exceeded to recommend to hisGovernment an amendment to the Memo: andum of unstanding of 1962 releasing us from any automatic obligation to continue the project jointly.    Even if the French Government refused to acceptM. Chamant&apos;s recommendation, the Attorney-General^ advice isSEGRET

that we could withdraw unilaterally v/ithout running a serious risk of having to pay damages unless the Court were to take the view that commercial prospects were relevant and that these prospects were good, or unless the French had offered us reasonable terms forcontinuation that we should have accepted.    Nevertheless following the meeting we propose to have, a further exchange of letters withM. Chamant is clearly necessary to underline the importance woattach to maintaining the criteria.    What I have in mind, subjectto the advice of the Attorney-General, is a letter which, whilstemphasising our concern at the further deterioration in the positionand our continuing reservations regarding the projects chances of achieving technical and commercial success, states that although the 600 million figure has already been reached, we propose, followingour September, 1968, agreement, to continue the project to the endof 1969 and to review it then in tho light of the criteria agreed lastyear.     This would, of course, again be without prejufice to our rights in the event of a fundamental change in circumstances.27,      While this means postponing a decision until the end of 1969 theadvantages of this course of action are:-(i)  It enables us to have the benefit of nine months1 flight testsbefore we need to take a final decision.    In this time some of thepresent uncertainties should be reduced, . We should, for example,be much clearer by mid-1969 about Concorde&apos;s engine noise.(ii) If at the end of 1969 we should decide that in all the circumstances the right course is to cancel the project, we would then run far less riskof having to pay damages.(iii) We could defend publicly, if need be, the decision to pull out, onthe grounds that wc had given the aircraft a chance to prove itself butthat all the signs were so discouraging that we did not feel able tocontinue with the project.(iv) If, on the other hand, the flight trials between now and the endof the year go well and the prospects are more encouraging, we might decide that the right course was to continue with the project althoughkeeping it under regular review.Recommendation28.      I recommend to rny colleagues Course No. 2 on the grounds thatit would be wrong to take an irrevocable decision at this stage, and thatin any case, given the legal obstacles, it is the only practical course open to us.    If this is agreed, I would propose to meet M. Chamant assoon as possible with a view to seeking his agreement to an exchange of letters on the lines indicated.    I would then report back to my colleagues.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.Vf.1.17th March, 1969

ANNEX AREPORT   TO   BRITISH   AND   FRENCH   ministers by   THE   CONCORDE   DIRECTING   COMMITTEE   (C.D.C.)First FlightSince our last report to Ministers the Concorde prototype 001 has successfullycompleted its first flight at Toulouse.     Although one Bust exceroise caution indrawing conclusions at auoh an early stage it is clear that the behaviour of theaircraft was excellent.Payload/range performance1      In order that the aircraft may be able to achieve the target&quot; paylcjad (i.e.for the &quot;Paris/New York Summer&apos; design mission, 20,000 lb, on initial entry into service, rising to 25,000 lb. two years later) it is necessary that the fourimportant design changes proposed by the airframe finn3 (new shapes of wingleading edges, wing tips and rear fuselage, and increased fuel capacity) be approved.2      The CDC&apos;s current estimates of the payloads likely to be achieved by aircraft to the configuration now proposed (i.e. including the four importantdesign changes already mentioned) are still subject to considerable margins of uncertainty.     Within these margins, the CDG&apos;s &quot;most likely1 estimates are15,000 lb. on initial entry into service, rising to 23,500 lb. two years later.3      The target figure of 20,000 lb. payload for initial entry into service couldbe achieved if two relatively small changes were made in the definition of the design mission.(a) Minor changes in holding speeds and altitudes at destination;   andit is reasonable to expect that these will be acceptable to air traffic control authorities.(b) A reduction of less than Vfo in overall regularity (from S&amp;fo to 97$)*The CDC considers that this reduction is reasonable but that the airlines could not be expected to commit themselves on this point at the present time.4      If the prospects of achieving target payloads should deteriorate, in practice the only possibility of restoring the situation (short of a complete review ofthe concept of the project) would be by improvement of the whole propulsion unit.5      The firms&apos; estimates of payload are substantially more optimistic than thoseof the CDC.     For example, firms&apos; calculations lead to a payload, for the con-figuration now proposed, of 26,000 lb. on initial introduction into service, andwhilst they have admitted that even on their own assumptions, 20,000 lb. wouldbe a more realistic figure, they would strongly dissent from the CDC&apos;s view that15,000 lb. ia the most&quot; likely figure.6      The margins of uncertainty in the payload estimates cannot be substantially reduced until the results of sustained flight testing of the prototypes atcruising speed are available and have been assessed.     The manufacturers and theG.D.G. 32dated 7th March 1969.

- 2 -and the CDC are agreed that this cannot be done before June 1970*Airfield Noise7      The CDCs current assessment of the airfield noise situation on entry into service is as follows -Approach noiae is likely to be about 5 PNdB lower than that of the boeing 707 or Douglas DC.8.Lateral noise at take-off will almost certainly be higher than thatof existing airliners - the most likely figure being about PNdB higher.Flyover noise on some hot days is likely to be about 2 to 3 PNdB abovethe levels currently permitted at New York or London.The firms1 assessment of the noise situation is more optimistic than that ofthe CDC.     The margins of uncertainty in the current estimates should tjeprogressively reduced throughout 1969:   there should be a substantial reductionin the uncertainty by June 1969*Development Costs8      In CDC.24 of 7th June I968, the CDC reported that their basic estimate ofthe costs to the two Governments for the extramural development programme was&amp;530M (7400 MP) on a January 1966 price basis, but they added contingenciesof up to  150M (2100 MP) so as to arrive at a total of  680H (9500 MF).,    these estimates were derived from a study of-estimates presented by the firms inDecember 1967* which (on a comparable basis) totalled  484M (6800 MP).9      Having reviewed the estimates, the CDC now report that their basio estimate(on the same January 1966 price basis) is now  596M (8220 MP) - a rise of  661(820  MP) on their previous basic estimate of  530M (7400 MP).     About half ofthis increase is attributable to the design changes proposed by the firms to restore the prospects of achieving target payload (not only the four airframechanges mentioned in paragraph 1, but also weight saving changes, and considerablechanges to the engine).10     The CDCs basic estimate contains only such margins as are judged sufficientto allow for such unplanned work as may normally be expected to arise in thecourse of the programme currently envisaged.     The programme currently envisagedabsorbs a part of the contingency of  150M (2100 MP; quoted as an addition to the basic estimate in CDC.24.     At the same time, the scope for further changesconsistent with the continuation of the project has been much reduced.     The CDCtherefore considers that the upper limit of  680M (9400 MP) remains sufficient tocover the worst eventuality consistent with the continuation of the project.   ThetCDCs current estimates therefore cover a range from  596M (8220 MP) to  680M(9400 MP).11    The firms&apos; estimates from which the CDCs current basic estimate of  596(8220 MP) derive were presented in January 1969 and on a comparable price basisthey total  561M (7742 MP).12    With past expenditure expressed at historical prices, and future expenditure

expressed at current prices, the estimates given in paragraph 10 are as follows -British French BothGovernment        Government       Governments M MF        m MF        m MFFrom inception (29.11.62) to31.12.68, at historical 155      2030      146      1900     301       3930prices.From 1,1,69 to completionat January 1969 pricesbasic estimate I84      2170      242   -  2870      426        504O-    contingency 57       675       57       675      114       1350Timesoale for introduction into service13    The firms1 public position is that their target is to obtain a certificate of airworthiness at the beginning of 1973 and to have enough production aircraftdelivered to certification standards for airlines to start services in 1973.They claim that Concorde has a lead of at least 5 and. probably 7 years over theproposed American SST.14    The CDCs view is that the firms are unlikely to achieve certification before june 1973. and that the most probable date is between December 1973 and June 1974.They consider that Concorde still has a lead of at least 4 years over its Americanrival.     These CDC estimates of certification date may be further changed by theresults of the study of production programmes mentioned in para.17.Selling price and market15    The latest information available to the CDC suggests that if the costs ofproduction are to be covered and allowance made for development levy on a sliding scale of 4$ to 10$, the unit selling price of the aircraft will have to be atleast jf$24M at 1968 prices (i.e.  10M or 110 MF).16    On the assumption that Concorde will achieve its target payloads (and atthe time be able to comply with airfield noise requirements), but that there willbe a ban on overland supersonic flight, the firms assess a minimum market for250 Concordes up to 1980, and that it will continue to sell until the end of the20th Century.     The CDC are at present reviewing their sales estimates, but theirprovisional view is that sales are not likely to be greater than one half of the firms&apos; estimates.     The market would be appreciably greater if there wer^e only a partial restriction on overland supersonic flight.Production Plans17    At present, the firms have no authority to continue manufacture of production aircraft beyond numbers 1 to 3 (which are needed to achieve certification) andwith 44 engines needed for the development programme.     The uncertainties con-cerning the out case of the development programme indicate the need for care and

judgement in authorising further production.18    The CDC has asked the firms to study a range of production possibilities(including the repercussions on the development programme) from limited authority-being given within ^the next few months to no authority being given before assess-ment has been made of sustained flight at cruising speed and of airlines&apos; reactions.The CDC has meanwhile advised the firms that the programme they currentlypropose in unacceptable.

ANNEX BEXCHANGE OF LETTERS BETWEEN M. CHAMANTAND MR. WEDGWOOD EEJNTranslation of letter from M. Chamant to Mr. Wedgwood Benndated 27th September 1968&quot;Following our meeting on the 24th SeptemberI should like to tell you again how pleased mycolleagues and I were at the atmosphere offrankness and understanding in which our conversations took place.We have not so far arrived at a completeidentity of views, but I am confident that our respective attitudes are so close that we shallnot be long in arriving at identical viewpointsand that we shall very quickly reach full agreement.The attached note is a summary of my views and the concessions which I can accept.   I shouldbe glad to know your feeling in this matter.&quot;Translation of the text of the note referred to inthe above letter&quot;Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn, British Ministerof Technology and M. Jean Chamant, French Ministerof Transport have arrived at the followingunderstanding in regard to the Concordes1.     Active continuation of the project untilthe second half of 1969, by which date the Mach 2flights of the aircraft will have provided thenecessary information on the actual performance of the Concorde.2. At the end of 1969, a decision to betaken on the continuation of the project basedon commercial prospects:(a) Orders from four major airlines,including at least one Americanairlines project to be continued.(b) No prospect of orders, project to be terminated.Ac) ..

(c) Prospect of orders but at the price ofmodifications to the aircraft involvingincreased development costs and afurther delay in the programmesMinisters to discuss the continuanceof the project based on a comparison of ^prospects and increased cost andtimescales.(d) In the event of the estimated development costs at that date being more than  600 M(8,300 MP) in January 1966 conditions,each of the two Ministers to propose totheir respective Governments an amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding of1962 releasing each Government from anyautomatic obligation to continue the project jointly.3.       If in the meanwhile the ConcordeDirecting Committee considers that there is nolonger any hope of sales or of maintaining thedevelopment costs below the limit of  600 M (8,300MP) in January 1966 conditions, it will, of course,report to the Ministers who will then considerthe situation but will not require to be informedstep by step of the development of sales prospectsbetween now and the end of 1969.&quot;Text of Mr. Wedgwood Benn&apos;s reply, dated 12th November 1968&quot;Thank you for your letter and enclosure of27th September.    I have discussed this with mycolleagues and we accept your proposal.Our acceptance is of course without prejudice to whatever rights a Government may have on theground of a fundamental change of circumstances.I should like to take this opportunity to thank you for what was, I think, a most valuable and helpful discussion and to place on recordmy appreciation for the courtesy you have shownand for the very careful consideration you havegiven to this difficult matter.&quot;

ANNEX CCONCORDEInch is trial con sequences  of cancellation1.      Concorde  currently directly accounts  for up to  16,000-jobs i&quot; the lift   aircraft  Indus try,  of which about 8,000 are atBristol.     liAC employ some &apos;*, 900 workers  on Concorde air frameand assembly work a t Filtou,  and Rolls-Royce  (Bristol Imagines;.&apos;,500 workers are employed  on Concorde at  MAC &apos; s  Weybridgefactory;    at  least 2,^00 are  employed at  equipment  firms  throu,&quot;,&apos;h-IThe effects  of cancellation are best, examined  by  consideringseparately the  short and  I.lie more general longer term effects.Short_term effects of canoe I 1 a t :l onMAC a I;  present employ some k, 900 workers on airframe and assembly work on  the Concorde at  Hilton.     In addition,   Rolls-Royce  (li.risl.ol  Engines  Division)  employ  about.  3,000  on   theOlympus  *59 *i,  ffivinn&quot; a  total of about 8,0&quot;0.    Allowing for normalwastage and turnover&quot;,   the Department of Employment  and productivity estimate  that  some 7*000 workers would have  tofind  other employment  if Concorde- were abandoned.

It is

&apos;;.      It is difficult  to estimate  the rate at which reabsorptionof these unoitfiloyod would  tako place but previous experience(the aircraft cancellations  in  1965,   and  the BMC redundanciesin Birmingham in  1966)  indicates it would be optimistic  toassume that more  than hall&apos; of the redundant workers would bere-employed within one month.    A reasonable assumption is thatthis fifvure could rise to about  two-thirds within  three months and about four-fifths within six months,   leaving about 1,400people still unemployed.     However,   the redundancies would  have repercussions  on  the general unemployment situation in the bristol area,  and  it would  ho unrealistic  to assume that  theeffect of such a lnrtfe redundancy would disappear for at least a year after  the  initial impact.h.      Apart from this immediate effect,   BA.C would almost certainly decide,  if Concorde were cancelled,   to close downFti.lt on completely and.    transfer the non-Concorde work  there toits  other Divisions  at  Woybridgo,   Burn,   and Stevenage.     Thiswould involve further redundancy of 2,800 aircraft workers and1,000 on Guided  &apos;. capons some  of whom would undoubtedly be offeredtransfers.    The  transfer of work could stretch over a year ormare,   and  such phasing; would  obviate  any  sudden  further substantialrise  in  the unemployed register.    It seems likely  that  there mi^htstill be an appreciable residual  effect  on unemployment atBristol 6-1 a months after the  final closure.    The  transfer ofwork to   &apos;eybrid^e would considerably relieve any remainingunemployment problem in that area, whilst worsening the Bristolposi hi on./5.     There   ...

5,      There should  be some  scope for transferring someproductioTb work from  the Derby and satellite plants of Rolls-Royce over   Lite  next  few years,   but   the cancellation  of  theOlympus  59&apos;i would certainly reive rise  to an immediate loss of jobs  in  excess of &quot;&apos;, ,00c.6.       Every  increase  of   !,000  on the unemployed register in  the bristol area implies a rise of&quot; 0. ?/;.  in the rate of unemployment.^eybridre.    Allowing for normal wastage and turnover,  a redundancyof rather over 2,000 would  present a difficult  short-turnredeployment problem but  the effect on. the  labour market wouldbe spread  over&apos;.a fairly wide area.    Assuming,   as is likely,   thatMAC would  close its  Pilton works and  transfer work to Weybridgethe problem would eventually be ranch reduced,  but as  this wouldtake some  time  the immediate effect on Weybrid&apos;ve would  be quiteserious.    Every increase of  I , 000 on the unemployed, register inthe Weybridge  travel   to work area implies a rise of 1 .2/ in therate of- unemployment;    but   the present rate is only 1 .0&apos;;..(c)    Other areas8,       It  is difficult   to identify  other areas  which are  likely  tohe affected   to a  marked decree by redundance os arising fromcancellation of  the Concorde.    There are about   5,000 jobs  involvedspread over a Vnr-&quot;&quot;o number o&apos;   firms,    Most of the firms are notlocated  in development areas and  it is  probable  that the main effect would lie  in areas where employment opportunities are at presentreasonably good.7.some,600 workers are  employed on Concorde by BAC at/IndustrialSECRET-3-

Industrial relations problems9.     Cancellation of Concorde might well lead to industrial unrest in the aircraft industry and elsewhere.    It is difficultto anticipate what form it might take.    Overtime would at certain factories almost certainly be banned, and the unionsI might insist on a longer rundown period than anticipated.Alternative resources10.   The capital resources released by cancellation of Concordeare not likely to be readily transferable, and this assessmenttherefore concentrates on the manpower resources.11.   Paragraphs 2-7 above give an account of the numbers whowould be affected by an immediate cancellation and the effect this would have on the employment situation in Bristol andWeybridge.    Taking account of normal wastage and turnover therewould be net redundancies of about 7,000 and 12,000 if BAC(Filton) were closed down altogether.   Those declared redundantwould probably contain a nigher proportion than average of high quality labour both in terms of normal skills and professional qualifications.    These skills are of a kind whichcould contribute significantly to improved competitiveperformance in the engineering industry. ,12.   The medium term forecast for engineering output and productivity suggests that there will need to be an overallexpansion in employment especially from the end of iy6y andtnat the needs of the mechanical engineering sector inParticular will be expanding.    Certain categories of manpower,such as qualified engineers, may be highly specific to theaircraft industry.    Some in these groups may nave to move to* SECRETu - /other

other areas or even overseas in order to obtain jobs employing1and rewarding their talents to the extent they have been usedto.   Experience suggests that these groups have more difficultyin finding s\iitable jobs but three-quarters of the qualifiedengineers who took another job after the aircraft redundanciesin I965 found it within twelve weeks.13.    The proportion of the skills, particularly in the manualgroup, is usually lost to industry when a large redundancy ofthis 3ort takes place because many workers are re-employed injobs which do not use their own  specialised skills,    however,the DEP has done everything possible to ensure that details ofsuitable skilled, vacancies, both locally and in other parts ofthe country, were brought to the attention of all concerned,lh.   The usual special arrangements made in such cases would apply and teams of employment staff would attend the factories to give information and advice to the workers on employmentmatters well before their jobs were due to come to an end.Revenue effectslb.   The redundancy and redeployment situation created bycancellation would involve out payments in the form of redundancy payments and national insurance benefits, ana lossof revenue from direct and indirect taxes.    Some of these losses would occur immediately but others would be spread overa number of. years - particularly as some of the redundantworkers would  . take jobs which would otherwise have been/filled

filled, from the rank a of the unemployed.    Allowing for theeffects of normal wastage and turnover, a total redundancy of ,Goo at Bristol (it is assumed that the redundant workersin other areas would be quickly absorbed) could lead toredundancy payments etc. and loss of revenue to the Exchequeramounting to:-1969/70 l..-&apos;70//l 19/1/72 19,2/73 introduction. &apos;.&apos;.3M. f.2M.  1MThe comparable figure a for a total redundancy of 12,000 (thefigure aaBurning a complete closure of Hilton and transfer ofnon-Concorde work elsewhere) are as follows:MJ/.m.      ^2i i:n      mini      nm/ii:/bM. i^M.  hM.  2M.Note:    (i)    These estimates assume that trie Board ofTrade would relax its IDC policy in the bristol area(.i i. )    Although, the redundancies should all be absorbed within a few years, it is pro-banlothat the new employment found w.i II be at a lower rate of pay ana nonce there will be some continuing loss of tax revenue.More.....general and long term effects16.    Looked at purely in terms of immediate loss of jobs,  the cancellation of Concorde may be seen to have several effectsonly in one area (Bristol) and one large industrial unit (BAG).But this would be to ignore other more general and long term efj/&apos;!/.

17. Concorde accounts for more than a fifth of the prospective production of the aircraft industry in the mid &apos;70s when it would support some 37.000 jobs (18.000 these jobs would be at BAC and about 1,200 Rolls-Royce). Past experience of aircraft cancellations and forecast trends in engineering output and productivity suggests that the majority of redundant skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers should be readily absorbed in the engineering industry. Nevertheless, the cancellation of Concorde would have a most damaging effect on the morale of the rest of the aircraft industry and possibly on the other advanced technological industries.
