H. S. Crossman, M.P.,and adopted at the Labour Party Conference; secondly, a memorandum by a&quot; technical sub-committee,&quot; containing a &quot; working model&quot; scheme on theprinciples laid down in Part I. The National Executive Committee take formalresponsibility for Part I only, emphasising the purely illustrative nature of the&quot; working model &quot;; but until now this distinction has not been stressed by Partyspokesmen and has largely been ignored in published comment.SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSALS3. The following is based on the two parts of the booklet taken together.Apart from the proposed increase in the basic rate and the eventual aim of half-payon retirement for the average earner, the various figures quoted are not underwrittenin Part I.(a) The basic pension rate for a single person to be raised &quot; at once &quot; to  3a week, with unspecified increases in other benefits and in national assistance. This would not apply to the wife&apos;s pension on the husband&apos;sinsurance, which would remain at whatever level it had reached whenthe increase took place. This restriction of the increase to the singlerate was defended by Mr. Crossman at Brighton on the ground that theneed is greatest among persons living alone. He is reported as sayingthat roughly 75 per cent, of pensioners are single or widowed. this figure is however reached by counting a married couple as one pensioner.The correct figure for individual pensioners is about 54 per cent. In anycase, by no means all of the single or widowed live alone.(b) A compulsory scheme of &quot; national superannuation,&quot; for old age andwidowhood, with contributions and benefits related to the insured person&apos;s earnings, to be grafted on to the existing National Insurancescheme. The contribution rates, which would replace the presentpensions element in the flat-rate National Insurance contribution, wouldbe: employees, 3 per cent.; employers, 5 per cent.; self-employed, 8 percent. in each case on earnings up to about  40 a week. TheExchequer would contribute 2 per cent, of the total earnings of thecommunity. Out of the Fund so created would be paid pensionsconsisting of the basic flat rate plus a graded element, with a ceiling ofabout  15 a week for the total, excluding any wife&apos;s pension. Ultimately,early next century, a person earning about the national averagethroughout his life would get half pay on retirement. The contribution and benefit rates are however admitted to be tentative only, depending on the extent to which the earning section of the community is willing52417b
to forgo consumption in order to provide for old age. &quot; If the readiness to save is less than anticipated . . . the average worker would receiveless than half pay at 65.&quot;(c) Each employee covered by an existing superannuation scheme that satisfiedcertain conditions would have the right to choose between becoming afull member of the State scheme or paying a flat-rate National insurance contribution, increased as necessary, for the flat-rate basic pension only.The main conditions would be: level of provision comparing notunfavourably with that of the State scheme; transferability of fullpension rights on change of employment; and either funding or statutory guarantee. The self-employed would have to join the state scheme unless they had &quot; already made adequate and irrevocableprovision &quot; for old age. The non-employed would continue with flat-rate contributions and benefits.(d) The basic pension would be &quot; inflation-proof &quot;   i.e., its full purchasingpower would be maintained. The graded element would be &quot; dynamic &quot; i.e., would be scaled up at the time of award according to whateverrises there had been in average earnings during the employee&apos;s working life. There is no suggestion in Part I that the graded element would bemade &quot; inflation-proof &quot; after award, though Part II appears to assume that it would.(e) Employed married women would not as such be allowed to opt out ofNational Superannuation.(f) Increased pensions would be provided in return for postponement of drawing them; but the present retirement condition and earnings rulefor National Insurance pensions might well be abolished.(g) The scheme would not be actuarially funded; nevertheless a large fund is contemplated, primarily for investment. Its Government-appointedtrustees would have &quot; the same opportunities to carry out profitableinvestment of their funds as private insurance companies.&quot;(h) Sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, &amp;c, are assumed to remain atflat rates; but an examination of their future is stated to be currentlyproceeding, and the Trade Union Congress (T.U.C.) have recentlyhinted strongly that they too should be graded according to earnings.The increases which are in any case proposed for them (see (a) above)would no doubt entail increases in the additional contribution elementsfor them, though this is not brought out.Examples of the total contributions, including assumed elements for other benefits and for the National Health Service, together with the corresponding pension rates,are given in the Appendix.CRITICAL COMMENTS ON THE PLANStatus of Part II of the Booklet, its Miscalculations and their Effect on the Fund4. By disclaiming responsibility for the &quot; working model,&quot; the national executive Committee have left themselves a free hand on almost every feature ofthe scheme, including the contribution and benefit rates, while as a result of thepublication of Parts I and II together the impression has been given that the&quot; working model&quot; is a properly thought out scheme which represents the LabourParty&apos;s concrete proposals. Mr. Grossman has however been quick to dissociatethe Labour Party from the &quot; working model &quot; scheme following my criticism ofits calculations at Brighton last week see his letter in The Times of16th October. Part II contains the following grave miscalculations andinconsistencies (a) The income of the scheme from percentage contributions on earnings hasbeen over-estimated because the figure used for the total income from employment includes  ,(i) employers&apos; National Insurance and Superannuation contributions;(ii) income in kind;(iii) earnings of persons in Northern Ireland (while making no allowance for the cost of benefits there);(iv) earnings over the proposed ceiling of about  2,000 a year.
(b) The expenditure of the scheme has been under-estimated because- -(i) expenditure on widow&apos;s benefits for widows under pension age hasbeen omitted;(ii) no allowance has been made for the cost of administration;(iii) it has been assumed that female pensioners aged between 60 and 65when the scheme began would not qualify for the  1 increase,whereas both Part I of the booklet and Mr. Crossman&apos;s speech at the Labour Party Conference make it clear that they would;(iv) a substantial saving has been assumed for postponed drawing ofpension; this, in the absence of a retirement condition, is quiteunrealistic.When all these items are corrected, the estimated surplus on pensions accruingin the first year of the scheme is reduced from  385 millions to about  100 millions,and the estimated cumulative net addition to the Fund from  3,750 millions in thefirst ten years to about  300 millions in the first six years, after which there wouldbe a steadily increasing annual deficit.Alleged Addition to Real Net Savings5. The claim that the scheme would itself produce important additional savings for investment is unfounded, not only because of the mostly illusory natureof the surplus but because in any case it cannot be assumed that savings throughthe Fund would not be offset by dissavings elsewhere.Inflationary Aspects6. The introduction of contributions totalling 10 per cent, of earnings and indeed more, if account is taken of the cost of higher short-term benefits would seriously aggravate the wage-price spiral, particularly through the substantial increases in employers&apos; contributions, most if not all of which would be passed onthrough higher prices. One way and another, as consumer and taxpayer, the employee would have to pay a good deal more than his own 3 per cent, contribution.7. Perhaps even more seriously inflationary in the longer run would be the psychological effect of the scheme on the great mass of the community. The built-in guarantee of the benefits against inflation would suggest Government acceptanceof defeat in its struggle against inflation and invite a similar surrender elsewhere inthe community. It would thus destroy any faith there may be left in any form of long-term savings investments, such as Government Securities, not protected against inflation. Moreover for the majority of the community there would belittle incentive to genuine saving, i.e., forgoing consumption or other immediatebenefits, against old age, sickness or unemployment when under the scheme theycould rely on the State to see that they were provided for far beyond subsistencelevel.The Redistributive Character of the Scheme8. Higher paid workers would get a proportionately smaller return for their contributions than the lower paid, and the older a better return than the younger.Those of the higher earners who stayed in approved schemes (see paras. 10 and 11below) would however be able to escape this element of taxation. This inequitablearrangement is inherent in the scheme.Age Discrimination in the Contributory Structure9. Contributions between the ages of 25 and 45 are given only half the value for benefit purposes of those made at other ages. In the case of coal miners andother heavy manual workers these years of early middle life bring in the highestearnings, and later earnings, unlike those of the salaried worker, tend to fall away.This proposal is therefore likely to be criticised by manual workers&apos; organisationswhen they come to appreciate it.Impact on Occupational Schemes10. In offering the right to contract out of the graduated part of the contribution, on the conditions referred to in paragraph 3(c) above, the plan52417
Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C. 2,17th October, 1957.recognises the importance of occupational schemes politically and economically;but:        &apos; t .   .&apos; - ;;. i     ....,       ij(a) The thoroughly non-commercial character of the scheme, with itssubstantial elements of redistribution and State subsidy, would go far-) to render nugatory the contracting-out provisions, except possibly inthe case of the higher paid workers, against whom the scheme is loaded.(b) It is moreover difficult to see how schemes run on commercial lines andfunded, as the tests for approval require, could compare favourably with a scheme whose benefits expanded automatically with rising prices.(c) The right given to each member of an approved&apos; scheme to opt would present the individual with a complex choice and would make for chaosin the finance and administration of the schemes.11. If, as seems probable from the above, few if any schemes would secureapproval, the option to contract-out becomes largely meaningless. Employers and members of occupational schemes which were not approved would either have topay the heavy graded contributions of the State scheme in addition to those required for the occupational scheme, or else the occupational schemes would bedrastically curtailed. There seems little doubt that the latter would happen, with serious economic and financial consequences. The development of new schemes would be checked, and an important instrument of private saving severely damaged.The T.U.C. and co-operative interests have drawn attention to this danger, andMr. Crossman sought to answer them in his Brighton speech by denying anyhostility to the occupational schemes as such. He has, however, promised todiscuss the matter further with the T.U.C. and a satisfactory solution has clearly not been reached.J. A. B.-C.

The booklet states that benefits other than pensions (which in the absence of any proposal to the contrary must be assumed to remain at flat rates) would be increasedsimultaneously with the  1 increase in the basic pension rate; an appropriate increase in the existing fiat rate contribution element for these other benefits (includingIndustrial Injuries benefits) has therefore been assumed.2. This is assumed to be at the increased rate payable since 2nd September, 1957.3. The figures given assume in each case a working life of 50 years after the scheme begins with earnings, cost of living and national living standards all steady throughout.* Limited to 75 per cent, of the earnings figure.t The highest contribution payable for this class of person.t The highest rate of pension payable.
