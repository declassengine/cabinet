(TEES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. f I4th October,, 1?57CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE:    COPPER WIREMemorandum by the Secretary; of Statefor Foreign affairs invite the attention of my colleagues to the United StatesMemorandum of 20th June, in which Her Majesty&apos;s Government were requested to Join the United States Government in submitting tothe Co-ordinating Committee in Paris .(C0C0M) a joint proposal toreimpose the embargo on the export of copper wire to the Soviet bloc.2.     The attached paper by officials (to which a copy of the UnitedStates Memorandum is annexed) discusses the form which our reply should take, and subsequent action.   In view of the difficult issues involved and the need for an early decision, I should like to discuss it with my colleagues in Cabinet on 7th October.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.4th October, 1957SECRET
EXPORTS Off COPPER WIRE TO THE SOVIET BLOCMsmorj-g-iduia .ly the Str-ybogic Exporta, (j^jCiolollJ^m-r^^eBackgroundThe lists of goods whose export to the Soviet Blocis embargoed or otherwise under control have been drawnup by the Co-ordinating Committee in Paris by referenceto certain agreed criteria,  one of which is that control should be imposed on&quot;Materials .........  in which the Soviet Blochas a deficiency which is critical in relation toits military capabilities and which it could notovercome within a short period.&quot;This criterion covers not only items of immediatemilitary application, but also materials required for strategic stockpiling.2.      In the light of this criterion, exports of copperfrom COCOM countries to the Soviet Bloc were placed under quantitative control in August, 1950, and underembargo in April, 1951.      The criterion against whichthis course was agreed has not since been amended byCOCOM.3.      Early in 195k9 Ministers decided that the embargolists should be reviewed with a view to the deletion from them of items whose strategic importance had diminished.They decided that copper in all forms should bo deletedfrom the lists.      These proposals were discussed withthe United States who strongly opposed the deletion of copper.      It was finally agreed in the course of discussions between Ministers in Washington that coppergenerally should remain on the embargo list,  but that
1 1 QSECRET 11&quot;copper wire (subsequently defined as of 6 mm. diameterand less)  should be subject only to surveillance.Revised lists were then agreed in COCOM,- and came intooperation in August, 1954.h..      In 1955 a review was undertaken in Whitehall ofpolicy on security controls on East/West trade in thelight of revised strategic doctrine and planningassumptions for thermo-nuclear war.      Ministers agreedthat controls should in future apply only to:-(a) Atomic Energy materials(b) Defence equipment proper (including machineryspecially designed for making it)(c) Items involving important military &quot;know-how&quot;(d) Specialised telecommunications equipment.Our grounds for thinking that the time had come forfurther pruning of the COCOM Lists were outlinedinformally in 1955 to United States officials in paris and in London and their reactions were unresponsive.      Inthe light of the unsatisfactory outcome of the meetingof the Foreign Ministers in Geneva, it was decided not to pursue the question further pending s ettlement of the more urgent question of the China differential.      Duringdiscussions with the Americans the lists prepared on thebasis of the new proposals were not shown to them ordiscussed.      These lists did not include copper in any form.5.     When the decision was taken to remove copper wirefrom the embargo list, we told the Americans that it was extremely unlikely that exports of copper wire of 6 mm.diameter and less would be large enough to frustrate the embargo of copper metal.
secret .      In fact, however, the Soviet Union and Poland have sinceimported copper wire on a very large scale.    In 1956,  for example,imports of copper wire from COOOM countries amounted to 85,000 tons which is equivalent to approximately one-fifth of estimatedSoviet bloc domestic production of copper.    Of this amount,  about53,600 tons was exported by the United Kingdom.    In the absenceof exports of copper wire there would have been almost no increasein Anglo/Soviet trade between 135k and 1956, i. e.  since the relaxation of some controls in 1954 as a result of the G0C0Mreview in that year.    (in 1954,  total United Kingdom direct exportsto the U. S. S. It. were  10 million.    In 1956 they had risen to 26 million, of which  15 million represented copper wire.In the same year an additional  4 million of copper wire wasshipped by the United Kingdom to other countries of the soviet bloc.    In 1956, the only larger item in Anglo/Soviet trade wasrubber,  which, however, as a re-ex-port is not included in thefigures above.)7.      The Americans have repeatedly expressed their disquietat these developments.    In late 1956 they proposed, joint discussions between Intelligence experts to establish the factualsituation.    The experts submitted a factual report to the twoGovernments in March, 1957.    The figures quoted in this reportshowed that previous estimates of the domestic production of copperin the Soviet bloc had been too high,  (for the year 1955 thedifference &quot;between the two estimates was about 15 per cent), andthat imports of copper wire from C0C0M countries constituted a considerably greater proportion of the copper available, in theperiod 1 954-56, to the Soviet bloc than had previously beenbelieved.    The report showed that even with the advantage ofthese imports the Soviet Union was having to draw on itsstrategic stock-pile of copper, and was able to meet its require-ments of copper for military purposes only at the expense of-3-
its civilian industry.     Concurrently with one increase in importsof COCOM copper1 wire, earlier imports of Free World copper, someclandestine, declined, possibly as a result of more effective control.,8.      If the criterion, quoted above is neld to be valid tnis report,which has been subscribed to by our experts, justifies thereimposition of control on copper wire;    at least for so long asthe gap between Soviet requirements and Soviet domestic productionremains approximately as at present.9.     In an Aide Memoire dated June 20, 1957? (copy attached) theUnited States Government accordingly requested Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to join them in submitting to COCOM a  joint proposalfor the reimposition of the embargo on copper wire.Courses Open10,    In response to this United States request, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment could: -(a) agree with the United States proposal, and join themin a joint approach to COCOM;(b) return a flat negative;(c) offer  to discuss in COCOM tne possibility of placingcopper wire under quantitative control;(d) offer to discuss with the United States (and Canada) a revision of the criteria on the lines mooted in 1955, an(?- t0consider action in respect of copper wire in the lignt of the out-come of those discussions.These courses are discussed below.    (It is worth noting Chat, if wefirst embark on (c) and fail, it may then be that much moredifficult to.fall back on (b)).Accepta nee of the United States Proposal.11.    From the  point of view of ^nglo/Araeriean relations,this is clearly the host course,     iVis entered the recent
intelligence talks against the &quot;background of the existing criteria,although in our opening statement we did question their validity.If we do not accept the conclusion which,  in American eyes,inevitably flows from the review, we may appear to the americans to have entered into the review with reservations whichwe should at that time have expressed more explicitly.    the americans feel strongly on the subject of copper wire, and toaccept their proposal would do much to restore the spirit of co-operation and goodwill in the field of the controls on East/west trade.    There is little doubt that other COCOM member countries would follow a joint Anglo/American lead.12.    But against this must be set our commercial interests,  certaindomestic and Commonwealth political considerations, and our viewson the validity of the criterion leading to the view that coppershould &quot;Ue embargoed.13.    As stated above,  copper wire is now our largest single export to the U.S.S.R., and,  in the period 1954 to 1956 the onlycommodity in which direct trade increased substantially.    the discontinuance of this trade might lead the Soviet Governmentto retaliate in some different field;    and Soviet propaganda wouldattribute our decision to American pressure to which we hadsuccumbed in spite of the patent interests of the British exporter.The Soviet Embassy could also &quot;be expected to use its contacts tomake trouble in Parliament and elsewhere.    An embargo would also involve a net loss to the sterling area as a whole (which is not toany significant extent a net importer or exporter of raw copper)which could be as much as the whole of the  19 million a year whichthe trade has represented.    It would certainly be greater thanthe  3-4 million which the Americans have estimated as the likelynet loss to the United Kingdom.    Apart from this strictly UnitedKingdom interest, the loss of this trade would tend to depressfree world demand for copper, and could therefore have serious consequences for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
1 9ASECRET 1 (&quot; 0The market price of raw copper has already fallen by mo.ce tnanhalf in the last eighteen months ( 437 to  201 per ton) and for sometime has stood below the level to which the Phodesian budget isgeared.     Sir Roy Welensky at the recent Commonwealth Conferenceremonstrated about the United Kingdom proposal (now being put intoeffect) to sell 27,COO tons of raw copper from the strategicst ockpile.14.    On the domestic front, the reimposition of the embargo would provoke an outcry from United Kingdom exporters which would rapidlybe reflected on botn sides of the House.     Traders and others wouldhave difficulty in understanding the need to reimpose the embargo.It would be argued that if copper wire is of such strategicvalue, the need to limit exports should have been foreseen earlier,particularly at the time when the Soviets were placing their big-contracts for 195b and 1957.      Ministers have said in parliament that we could nwt agree to any increase in the embargo lists unless this were justified on strategic grounds.     Tne reimposition ofthe embargo on copper wire would not , if Ministers werconvincedthat the existing criteria were strategically justified, violatethat undertaking, but it would certainly stimulate the campaign against tne Soviet bloc controls wnich is already under way inParliament,15.    The reimposition of the embargo would, however, have to bejustified in Ministers&apos; own minds by reference to the existingCOCOM criteria.      (These criteria are not public).      In fact the Cabinet two years ago concluded that the existing criterianeeded amendment, andc
SECRET124in particular the criterion which would justify thereimpoaition of the embargo on copper wire doe3 notappear in the new proposals then agreed.     ministers might well feel difficulty in defending publicly ameasure whose ostensible justification was not in their view valid.Total Refusal of the United States Request16.    The arguments set out in paragraphs 11 to 15 aboveapply here in reverse, if the American request isflatly refused.      Our commercial interests and theinterests of free world copper producers, includingthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, would be fully protected.     A minimum of domestic political difficulty would arise.      But on the other hand, Ourrelations with the Americans on the subject of strategic controls would suffer severely,  one! the damage mightextend into wider fields.      It would seem to them that wewere acting solely on selfish commercial grounds.The Possibility of Quantitative Control17.    There is a certain logic in the idea of quantitativecontrol.      Indeed., at the COCOM meeting on February 35 1955*the United Kingdom delegate stated that if future exportsappeared to indicate the frustration of the embargo on coppermetal,  the United Kingdom authorities would be ready todiscuss the matter again.     It would be theoreticallypossible to arrive at a quota for exports of copper wireto the Soviet bloc which would leave room for substantialexports but would, nevertheless, be small enough, as long asthe gap between bloc production and consumption of copperdid not decrease,  to necessitate continued withdrawals atthe present rate from the Russian&apos;s stockpile.      On the other-7-
SECREThand, it could equally be argued,  and would no doubt be argued by the Americans,  that if copper is strategic, weshould completely discontinue our exports of wire inorder to defer as long as possible the date when theRussians will have built up their stockpile to a level which they would regard as sufficient for embarking on major hostilities.      If,  therefore, we proposedquantitative restriction,  the Americans would be likely toview our motives with suspicion but they could hardlyrefuse the suggestion or take offence.18.    But previous experience of the fixing of quotasindicates that to suggest quantitative control would be,at best, only a delaying device.      Quantitative control for copper wire has been mentioned in GOCOM but not discussed in detail.     We did however, in 195^-s  suggest to Mr. Stassen that it would be sufficient if there wasa review of the position if exports of copper wirereached a level of 50,000 tons a year.      This did not satisfy the Americans and the matter was not pursued.If it is discuesed again,  the American attitude is likelyto be even more rigid than in the past.      It is notconceivable that any   quota acceptable to the americans would be large enough to preserve any substantial partof existing trade in copper wire, still less the UnitedKingdom share therein.      Discussions on this subject inCOGOM are therefore likely to result, probably quitesoon, in deadlock, unless the United Kingdom were substantially to change its ground.    A new solution would then again haveto be sought.Revision of the Criteria19^    The principal justification for our current exports of copper wire is in our view simply that the embargo on theexportto the Soviet bloc even of raw copper is no longer justified andin the light of current strategic thinking and planning assump-tions. There is,  therefore, great attraction in the suggestionSECRET    &quot;&quot;8**
that the fundamental criteria against which we judge the need to control exports of particular commodities should be reviewed and revised.      If we are certain that our case is so strong thatthe Americans cannot but be convinced, we should clearly put it to them.     But we cannot be sure that we will convince the americans.      There is a considerable body of opinion whichmaintains that it is not inevitable that thenno-nuclear weapons will be used in a future war.     Admittedly, theN....T.O.  Commanders, and the whole theory of the deterrentassume that, whether or not thermo-nuclear weapons were used by the enemy,  the N.A.T.O.  powers would have no option but touse them themselves.     But it can be argued that in the eventthis may not happen.     ^nd the Americans, with their greaterdistances, and more dispersed economy are known to bedevoting considerable energy to planning for the &quot;post-initial&quot;  phase of a future war, i.e.  the phase after the initial nuclear exchanges.      Quite apart from this,  it isimpossible to be certain, even if the basic assumption of ashort thermo-nuclear war is accepted,  that the criteriaemerging from ^nglo/United States discussions would be such that the reimposition of an embargo on copper wire would notbe justified,  and still less ttut in the course of negotiation on embargo lists copper or copper wire mightnot form one side of some kind of a bargain.20.    Although therefore this course has logical attractions,in relation not only to copper wire but to the controlsgenerally,  it will not necessarily safeguard our commercial interests in relation to copper.21.    Apart from this, the Americans will certainly be
12?SECRET 1 * *disappointed if our response to a proposal put by them asthe logical consequence of a joint study is merely to challenge the validity of the criteria.      On the otherhand,  the Americans have been aware of our views since1955 and expect us to revert to them sooner or later.Interim Action22,   Unless we either accept or totally reject theAmerican proposal, discussion of any alternative will belengthy.      Meanwhile, our exports of copper wire to theSoviet bloc under existing contracts continue at approximately the high 1956 rate, and the Board of trade will be under pressure to issue licences for yet furthertransactions.     We have to consider therefore not only how toproceed on the substance of the question, but what we are todo pending an agreed solution.      Clearly it would beprovocative, ^iven the known strength of American feelings,to allow the trade in copper wire to continue completelyunchecked;    but also if we are to negotiate with the americans on the propriety or level of copper wire exports,we would for purely tactical reasons, and apart from other considerations, not wish voluntarily to accept at thebeginning of the negotiation substantial limitations on our freedom of action.23.    In this connexion the Board of Trade could not forobvious reasons agree to any voluntary diminution of our exports to the Soviet bloc if there was&apos; a risk that ordersrefused by the United Kingdom would merely be-1 0-
SECRETSECRETtaken up by other COGOM countries.    On the other hand they wouldnot wish us to put ourselves into a false position by advocatingmultilateral limitation of exports in advance of prospectivediscussion with the Americans with a view to revision of theexisting criteria.    They consider that if it is decided that weshould seek revision of the criteria, the least unsatisfactorycourse which might be adopted as an interim expedient withoutseriously upsetting the Americans would be unilateral restriction of our exports to the bloc (including some provision for China)for any one year to the approximate level of our exports in thelatter half of 1956 and the first six months of this year,  i, e.about 65,000 tons.Summary and Conclusions2h.*    (a) The recent joint Intelligence review has shown thatif exports of copper wire from COCOM countries and particularly the United Kingdom continue at their present rate they will befrustrating the embargo on the export of copper metal.(b) Under the existing COCOM criteria this leads inevitablyto the conclusion that the embargo on copper wire should bere-imposed.(c) From the point of view of Anglo/American relationsthis course is very strongly to be recommended.(d) But Anglo/Soviet trade in copper wire has come to havesubstantial economic and political importance, and itsdiscontinuance could have adverse effects on Anglo/soviet relations and might cause them to retaliate in other fields,on the sterling area balance of payments, on world copperprices, and particularly on the economy of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.(e) We have to choose between two alternative &quot;once-and-for-all&quot; solutions, and two proposals for what might be prolonged discussions in COCOM.(f) The &quot;once-and-for-all&quot; courses are complete acceptance
or complete rejection of the American proposal.      The first is politically desirable and economically moat objectionable:the second is economically desirable and politically mostobjectionable.(g) The two longer term alternatives are to proposeeither quantitative control, or a review of the criteria.It is unlikely that agreement could be reached onquantitative control, and there is no guarantee that discussion of the criteria will ultimately produceconclusions acceptable to us.     If we propose either ofthese courses, the Americans may well think that we areprocrastinating or arguing solely to further our commercial advantage.(h) Whatever course,  other than complete rejection of the American proposal,  is adopted, something will have tobe done to stabilise or restrict the level of exports of copper wire to the Soviet bloc pending the full adoption ofa new policy.     But, unless purely nominal, such actioncannot be unilateral.25.     The Ministerial Committee is asked to give a ruling onwhich of the courses suggested above should be adopted.SECRET-1 2-
United States Memorandum.As Her Majesty&apos;s Government is aware, the United StatesGovernment since late 1954 has been seriously concerned at thelarge volume of copper wire moving to the Soviet bloc from theWest.     It is felt that the acute copper shortages in the soviet bloc, coupled with the evidence included in the recent jointfindings of our Defence/lmelligence specialists that largequantities of copper are used for military purposes in the Sino-Soviet bloc, provide full justification for our concern.There is no long r any basis for belief, as was represented by Her MajestyTs Government in early 1955, that the level of copper wire exports to the Soviet bloc represent  pent-up demandwnich will fall off.     The demand for such wire has remained at aconsistently high level which has, in the opinion of tne UnitedStates Government, resulted in frustration of the embargo overcopper.     In our view, copper wire is nothing more than coppermetal in another form.The United States Government strongly feels, as the report made so clear, that copper wire exported to tne Soviet bloc enablesthat area to overcome serious shortages which would otherwise hampercurrent Soviet military programmes.In view of the strategic importance of copper and in thelight of the joint United Kingdom-United States findings, theUnited States Government desires to propose in COCOM as soon aspossible that copper wire and cable (covered and uncovered) beplaced under embargo.     In connexion therewith, the United StatesGovernment requests Her. Majesty&apos;s Government to join it in sub-mitting a joint proposal to COCGM to obtain this objective.-13 -&quot;
