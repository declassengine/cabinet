secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957C. (57) 228 Copy No. 5 3Uth October, 1957CABINETCIVIL AVIATION : BRITANNIA aircraft memorandum by the Minister of supply the Cabinet will wish to know the present position on the Britannia project andthe further steps which seem necessary if the success of the aircraft is to be ensured.2. For the purpose of this memorandum account heed be taken of only two ofthe various marks of the Britannia the medium range 100 series, which is already in service on the eastern routes of the British Overseas Airways Corporation(B.O.A.C.), and the long range 300 series, now beginning to be delivered to B.O.A.C.and to the Israeli Air Line El Al for the trans-Atlantic route. Both series arepowered by Proteus turbo-propeller engines in slightly different versions, known asthe 705 and 755 respectively.3. The Proteus engine has an air intake arrangement which has resulted incertain icing troubles Which have been dealt with progressively as they occurred bythe Bristol Company in conjunction with my Department. My predecessor set Upa special. Committee under the Chairmanship of the Director, Royal aircraft establishment, fOf this purpose. In its early development stages the engine was fully and successfully tested in wet ice conditions. At a later stage difficulties were found to arise in the much rarer dry ice conditions encountered in inter-tropicalareas: these difficulties in turn were overcome with virtually complete success.But last May still mOfe infrequent climatic conditions were discovered which could result in a combination of wet and dry ice being sucked into the intake, withresulting engine stoppages and, occasionally, damage. These climatic conditions,about which little was previously known, are being intensively studied by the meteorological Office.4. The medium range 100 series with 705 engine has had a Certificate of airworthiness for some considerable time and a Certificate was recently issued inrespect also of the long range 300 series with 755 engine. An aircraft of the lattertype has very recently experienced, in the Miami area, engine trouble of a differentsort, unconnected with icing. A relatively simple modification to cope with thisis in hand and modified 755 engines will start coming forward almost immediatelyfor B.O.A.C. and El Al aircraft.5. Apart from the icing trouble associated with the intake in special criticallyclimatic conditions, the Proteus engine shows sighs of being one of the most reliableever designed and has already been granted an overhaul period by the AirRegistration Board of no less than 1050 hours which is phenomenal for an enginein so early a stage of its career. The troubles which have beset the engine are no greater than those which have been encountered by other aircraft of an advancedtype. In the case, for instance, of the Lockheed Constellation, one of the most successful of the generation of aircraft now passing, away, alarming troublesoccurred, notably in 1946-47, and at various later dates (after the aircraft had beenput into operation). An explosive and catastrophic fire broke out in a D.C.6 inoperation, due to fuel system faults; the aircraft became none the less a highly successful one. The Boeing Stratocruiser, again, which has been giving good service on the trans-Atlantic route, has had most serious trouble arising on propellers, whichare still operated under strict limitations.  The Viscount had a number of teething52374
troubles during its early period of operation, leading to forced landings in service.The earlier Viking type suffered also from major troubles after introduction into service.:1 6. The Britannia trouble is distinguished from these others, first by the fact&apos; that considerable research is required to put it right, and this at the peak of theproduction programme, and secondly by its having been spotlit with the most fortunate publicity. As a result, the hopes which it was legitimate to entertainas recently as a couple of months ago that this aircraft could command substantial additional sales in North America have for the moment been quenched and theCompany is being hard put to it to hang on to the foreign orders which it alreadyhas. It is in the national economic interest that a complete remedy for theBritannia&apos;s icing troubles be found, and be seen to be found, as soon as possible.This however cannot be done without some further measure of government support, financial and otherwise.7. There are three possible technical solutions, any one of which may be successful, and which are being pursued in parallel. The testing of these possiblesolutions requires a programme of further intensive flying. This special flyingcould be fitted into the normal B.O.A.C. training and route proving programme:but it would be a relatively slow process. If, however, an aircraft due shortly to be delivered to B.O.A.C. were to be specially allocated for this purpose, theperiod of test flying could be reduced to 6 months. It would be technicallyimpossible to reduce the period any further, no matter how much money was spent.8. It might be reasonable, since B.O.A.C. stand to gain the most from quickresults, that they should meet the cost of making the aircraft available for the testsand reinstating it to normal B.O.A.C. standards when the tests are completed; andthe Minister of Civil Aviation is pursuing this with the Corporation.The Bristol Company, as the result of the Proteus icing troubles, are in extremelystraitened financial circumstances (see paragraph 10 below). I therefore see no alternative to the extra cost of the flying tests being borne by my Department. Myestimate of the cost is between  500,000 and  1 million, depending on the stage atwhich success is reached. These financial proposals are now before the Treasury.9. Apart from these shorter-term measures designed to improve the reliability of the Britannia /Proteus combination, the longer-term question also arises whether there ought not to be more comprehensive testing of aircraft and aero-engineswhile they are still in the stage of development and before they go into operation.My Department will be submitting proposals on this point to the Committee whichis now examining the future of Government policy towards the aircraft industry.BristoPs Finances10. The troubles encountered by the Britannia and the publicity surroundingthem threaten serious consequences to the Bristol company. If it were unhappilyto turn out that no more than the eighty-three Britannias now planned were to be,completed, the Company would sustain a loss of some  8 millions- 10 millions onthe Britannia programme. The loss would be correspondingly greater if orders nowplaced were to be cancelled. Work on the Britannia amounts to about 40 per cent,of the Company&apos;s entire business. A loss of  8 millions- 10 millions would be avery severe blow to the Company but it would not in itself drive the Company into liquidation. There is, however, the immediate difficulty that delays in deliveriesare causing receipts from sales of Britannias to fall far short of what was expected and the Company are becoming acutely short of ready cash. Their overdraft has risen from  12 millions at the beginning of 1957 to nearly  18 millions, which isthe limit at present fixed by the Company&apos;s bankers. The overdraft threatens torise by as much as another  7 millions over the next 18 months and although itshould come down to a normal level in the latter half of 1959, the immediate lackof liquidity is a threat to the Company&apos;s solvency.11. If the Bristol Company were in fact to be forced suddenly out of business,the Britannia project in which so much national money and effort have beeninvested would be gravely imperilled. This contingency however can I think be avoided in the following ways.12. Five Britannia aircraft of the 300 series were on order for delivery tothe U.S.A. North East Airlines in the next few months.   Partly owing to North
Easfs internal financial difficulties, partly owing to the publicity surrounding theBritannia, the Airline has postponed the delivery of the five aircraft. These aircraft have been modified and equipped to the standards required for internal operation in the United States. They could nevertheless be used on B.O.A.C.&apos;s north atlantic or Caribbean routes and it would go a long way to re-establishing BristoFsfinances, and the Britannia project as a whole, if B.O.A.C. were to take up the fiveaircraft for their own immediate purposes. The Minister of Civil Aviation hastaken up this point with the Corporation.13. Secondly, the Bristol Company under their contract with B.O.A.C. onthe 100 series are due to be paid by the Corporation a substantial sum, put by theCompany at over  2 millions, in respect of aircraft already delivered and in service.The Minister of Civil Aviation has undertaken to use his good offices with B.O.A.C.in the hope of securing prompt payment of as much as possible of this sum.14. Finally, proposals have been submitted to the Treasury for speeding upcertain Government payments due to Bristol Aircraft Company and retardingcertain Bristol payments due to the Government.15. By these means, together with some further accommodation from theCompany&apos;s bankers, it should be possible to tide the Company over its currentcash shortage. Of the measures listed the most substantial is the purchase byB.O.A.C. of the five North East aircraft; in the absence of this, insolvency mightnot be avoidable without a Government loan, or at least a Government guarantee,if BristoFs are to be rescued from their predicament and I need hardly emphasise the difficulties of such a course.16. In the longer term a solution for the Bristol problem must be sought in the integration of the firm into a larger organisation on the general lines whichI suggested in my memorandum on the aircraft industry, C. (57) 154. I amcontinuing my efforts to this end, though no early results can be promised. Isense that the aircraft companies are awaiting some declaration of theGovernment^ intentions in regard to aeronautical research and development beforecommitting themselves. I hope, therefore, that the Government will be able toreach conclusions on these matters with the least possible delay.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2,9th October, 1957.
