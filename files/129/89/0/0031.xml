(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE FROFERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C,(57) 23115th October, 1957CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE:   WAGESNEGOTIATIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet have already decided to resist any pay increase for the railwaymen (C. C. (57) 67th Conclusions, Minute 2).    Any advance theycould justify by the rise in the wages and prices index would be so smallthat they ought clearly to do without it in the general interest.     To allowsuch an increase on top of that secured as late as March last, would clearly be the negation of any policy to control inflation.     The railwaymen&apos;sincrease in March was 5 per cent to 2 per cent more than had been awarded by the Railway Arbitration Tribunal.     Since then retail prices have risen about 2 points.2.      I must now report that the Whitley Council for the National health service clerical, etc. grades have agreed to give an increase of 3 per cent to their clerical grades (up to a salary level of  1,200) who got a3 per cent increase in January - in other words substantially what we intend to refuse to the railwaymen.    The offer was made by the Manage-ment Side despite clear representations to the contrary by the Ministerof Health and an indication, twice repeated, that if the offer were madehe would not necessarily implement it.3.      The decisions of this Council are not operative unless and untilthe Minister of Health gives formal approval under the regulationsauthorising the new rates to which they have agreed.     Ministers ofHealth up to now have always done this, though not bound to do so by theterms of the Council&apos;s constitution.    On this occasion I feel the Ministermust refuse to do so.     The Secretary of State for Scotland is, of course,also concerned.COPY NO.^4.     This would be a serious decision.    It could be represented thatthe Government were intervening in a barga.in freely negotiated in thenormal process of collective bargaining.     On the other hand it can fairly be argued that in this case the Management Side have no responsibilityfor finding the money (all of which comes from the Exchequer) and theMinister who has to find the money is entitled to say that he is neithergoing to provide additional finance for the Health Service nor curtail itsbenefits to foot this bill.5.      This is a pay decision in the public service which, unlike many other pay decisions, falls within the power of Government to decide.    Inmy judgment we should say No.P.T.Treasury Chainbers, S. W.l.14th   October, 1957.SIGNET
