confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957Copy No.C. (57) 24423rd October, 1957CABINETPUBLIC ACCESS TO CABINET RECORDSMemorandum by the Secretary of the CabinetIn 1954 it was recommended (C (54) 265) that Cabinet records should be opened to inspection in the Public Record Office when they are fifty years old.When this recommendation was discussed by the Cabinet on 3rd March, 1955(C.C. (55) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4) doubts were raised on two points:  (i) Would the law of copyright suffice to prevent private persons from publishing Cabinet records in extenso once they had been opened for inspection in the Public Record Office?(ii) Would it be practicable to withhold from the Public Record Office suchparts of the Cabinet records as could not suitably be opened to public inspection even after fifty years?I2. On the first point the position is that copyright in Government recordscontinues to vest in the Crown for fifty years from the date of first publication.The opening of the records to inspection in the Public Record Office would not amount to publication. It would therefore be a breach of copyright for any person to publish in extenso, without permission, the whole or any substantial part ofCabinet records opened to inspection in the Public Record Office. This copyrightprotection could be enforced in the United Kingdom, in other commonwealth countries and probably in the United States; but there are many countries in whichit could not be enforced.3. It is true that the Public Record Office have never sought to enforce CrownCopyright in respect of Government records in their custody. It is their practice to provide, on demand, photographic copies of documents or parts of documents which have been opened to public inspection. They find it convenient, both for themselves and to research students, to multiply in this way the means of easyreference to records which are unlikely to be made more widely available by officialpublication. They also think it reasonable that, as a historian living in or near london can come to the Record Office himself and make copies of documents inwhich he is interested, other historians living further away (including those overseas)should be able to obtain photographic copies if they are willing to pay for them.On the other hand, Departments have always exercised the right to decide on what conditions their records shall be opened to inspection; and the Public RecordOffice would find no great difficulty in applying a rule that Cabinet records shouldnot be copied in extenso, and that photographic copies of them would not besupplied, without specific authority.4. It thus appears (i) that practical precautions could be taken which would reduce within narrow limits the risk that private persons would attempt to publishin extenso Cabinet records which had been opened for inspection in the RecordOffice; and (ii) that, if the attempt were made, the remedy of legal proceedings for breach of copyright would be available as against publication in those countries where such an attempt would be most likely to be made viz., in this country, inother Commonwealth countries and (probably) in the United States.52381CONFIDENTIAL
II5. The Cabinet were also concerned lest, on some subjects, current policy or administration might be embarrassed by disclosure of earlier Cabinet proceedings.The point was made that if, for example, records were in existence of Cabinetproceedings of the period of the South African war, their publication at the presenttime might complicate our current relations with South Africa.6. Any difficulties that might arise on this score would apply to Departmentalrecords no less than to Cabinet records. On any particular subject the Departmentalrecords will certainly be more full, and probably more liable to contain unguardedexpressions of view, than the Cabinet records. Difficulties of this kind would not,therefore, be avoided by withholding Cabinet records from the Public Record Officeuntil a date later than that on which the corresponding Departmental records areopened to inspection.7. This problem is not, therefore, peculiar to Cabinet records. It applies toGovernment records generally. The remedy is to be found, in principle, in thereviewing arrangements proposed by the Grigg Committee, which contemplate a careful scrutiny of all documents before transfer to the Public Record Office, and intheir recommendation that Departments should exercise a discretion to withholdany which, on grounds of continuing secrecy or for other reasons, should not be disclosed. A discretionary system of this kind could be applied to Cabinet records though not without some practical difficulty on account of the manner in whichthese records are preserved in bound volumes. It would, however, be necessarythat all the Departments concerned with this problem in particular the ForeignOffice, Commonwealth Relations Office and Colonial Office should follow a consistent practice in applying a discretionary system.8. I have therefore discussed this problem with the Permanent Secretaries ofthe Departments most closely concerned. There is general agreement that (i) The   Departments   concerned  should   have  authority   to   withholdindefinitely from the public (a) the old India Office records;(b) papers dealing with Intelligence methods and sources;(c) papers dealing with Royal personages.(ii) Records of Imperial and Commonwealth Conferences, and records of theCommittee on Imperial Defence or other Ministerial meetings whichwere attended by Ministers from other Commonwealth countries,should not be opened to the public, irrespective of their date, withoutthe consent of the other Governments concerned.(iii) Papers relating to individuals e.g., criminal case papers, the records of individual members of the Services, &amp;c. may need to be withheldfor rather more than fifty years and, in any event, until the death ofthe persons concerned.(iv) In the relatively rare cases where a Department might still wish to reservedocuments at the end of the fifty-year period, the Department itself would not only take the necessary action to withhold its own papersbut would also ask other Departments to search for, and to withhold,connected papers.9. The legislation to implement the Grigg Report will be so drafted as toenable Departments, in agreement with the Lord Chancellor, to withhold anydocuments or classes of documents which they consider unsuitable for release.Departments are satisfied that their existing arrangements for the classification of their papers will suffice to enable them to take advantage of this statutorysafeguard for the exceptional categories of documents noted above, together withany other classes of record which may, on further consideration, appear liableto remain sensitive indefinitely. Otherwise Departments think it reasonable thattheir records should be made available to public inspection after fifty years. MostDepartments would find it impracticable to identify particular papers (as distinct from specified categories of papers) which should be withheld for some longer period/ It thus appears that the reviewing arrangements envisaged by the GriggCONFIDENTIAL
Committee, as the Departments propose to apply them in practice, would provide some protection against embarrassing disclosures, though not to the full extent which the Cabinet originally had in mind.10. If Departmental records are to be handled in this way, there is nothing to be gained by treating Cabinet records differently. I therefore recommend that cabinet records should be opened to public inspection after fifty years, subjectto the same proviso that particular classes of papers which should be very few may need to be withheld for a longer period. The definition of Cabinet recordswould include all memoranda and minutes (including Confidential Annexes) ofthe Cabinet and of Cabinet Committees.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd October, 1957.CONFIDENTIAL
