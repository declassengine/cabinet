secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957C. (57) 236 Copy No.18th October, 1957CABINETADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy Seal and the Lord chancellor the purpose of this paper is to seek the agreement of our colleagues to theappointment of a Royal Commission to consider the arrangements for theadministration of justice by courts of assize and quarter sessions. We are led tobelieve that such an inquiry is necessary by two different groups of considerations one arising out of problems of penal reform, the other out of problems of practical administration.2. In the field of penal reform there is much that can be done and is being done without any fundamental change in the machinery for dealing with offenders.The Home Secretary intends, for example, to press on with the programme of newaccommodation in prisons, hostels and borstals and of improving existing ones; toincrease the amount of work which is done by prisoners and borstal inmates andto improve the payments made to them for doing it; to revise the system ofclassifying prisoners and prisons; and in other ways to try to make the penal systemmore effective. A new research unit has been set up in the Home Office to try to discover, among other things, how effective existing penal sanctions are. It isproposed to include a brief reference to these projects in The Queen&apos;s Speech. Itmay be desirable in the not-very-distant future to examine the nature of thesesanctions and to consider whether in the light of modern views on the responsibilityof society towards both the offender and his victim they are all that is required.The time is not yet ripe, however, for such an inquiry and the immediate problem is to find a means of giving adequate effect through our machinery of justice to theconcepts of penal treatment which are already of general acceptance in law orpractice.3. The historic system of circuits of The Queen&apos;s Judges and quarter sessions of magistrates, which has come down to us little changed from an earlier age, isill-adapted to give effect to these concepts. The principles on which the sentencingof convicted offenders are now based assume that the court, having informed itself of the history, character and potentialities of the offender, and of the possible effecton him of the various forms of treatment available as penalties, will select the most appropriate form of sentence. The law provides magistrates&apos; courts with amplepowers to these ends, enabling them after conviction, but before sentencing, toremand for such medical, social, or other enquiries as they think fit. The superiorcourts however, which sit for short periods at long intervals, are virtually obligedto proceed direct from conviction to sentence.4. The plain intention of Parliament that the court should fit the sentence tothe offender, and should be given the information necessary to enable it to do so,is exemplified by the provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, which enables the courts to have before them, in the cases of offenders eligible for borstal training,corrective training or preventive detention, reports from the Prison Commissionerson the suitability of the offenders for such sentences; but again the machinery ofjustice has not been adapted to the effective use of this provision, since such reports52411
frequently have to be made, on offenders who have not been in custody long enough for adequate enquiries and observation, or who, having been on bail, are seen forthe first time at the court. Nor are the resources of-our local prisons in generaladequate to furnish full and helpful reports to courts. It is our intention, aseconomic conditions permit, to establish remand and observation centres where this essential work of furnishing the courts with full information on offenders canbe properly done on a scientific basis, but this provision will not help the;sUperiorcourts unless they are put in a position to obtain such information after conviction.The more we learn, in the light of modern developments in sociology andpsychology, about the results of treatment and the means of selecting the treatmentappropriate to the individual, the more difficult it will be to apply that knowledgeeffectively within the existing system.5. These views are confirmed by comments received from judges and-recorders, who lack the information necessary to enable them to select theappropriate sentence, but are reluctant to postpone sentence to enable enquiries tobe made because this may involve keeping the offender in custody, and in suspensefor anything up to three months; indeed, the Court of Criminal Appeal hasdiscouraged courts of quarter sessions from postponing sentence except for suchreasons as an offer on the part of a prisoner to make restitution or to give information. The difficulty of supplying the Court with adequate information doesnot arise where there is a semi-permanent court of the kind now existing in Londonand South Lancashire, and from the point of view of penal reform it is highly desirable that consideration should be given to the question whether in. the rest ofthe country it is right to maintain a system which makes it so difficult for the courts to discharge adequately the functions which modern legislation lays upon them.6. Although the primary reason for an inquiry is the need to improve theorganisation of the criminal business at Courts of Assize and Quarter Sessions, suchan inquiry must necessarily take account of civil business at Assizes as wellinasmuch as the Queen&apos;s Bench Judges try, or ought to try, both classes of businessat each Assize town. Apart from the increasingly large number of long criminal cases tried at Assizes, the great increase in civil business, particularly matrimonialcases, since the war has put the Assize system under great strain. There are atpresent fifty-eight Assize towns, some of them with small populations and littlebusiness, others where the business, both civil and criminal, is so heavy that theAssizes extend more or less continuously throughout the legal year. There havebeen serious delays in the transaction of civil business at certain towns, while thedisposal of the criminal business has caused great anxiety to the Lord Chief justice in his task of allocating the available Judge power equitably between London andthe provinces.7. We therefore think it desirable that a Royal Commission should beappointed to examine the arrangements for the administration of justice in courts of assize and quarter sessions, and in particular to consider what alterations arerequired to ensure that the Courts have before them the material necessary for theproper discharge of the increasingly difficult function of selecting the appropriatesentence. We do not propose that this Royal Commission should enquire into thesentencing policy of the courts; this is a subject more germane to the wider inquiry into the treatment of offenders which, as we have earlier suggested, might usefully be undertaken at a later stage. We propose that the Commission^ terms ofreference should be on the following lines: -&quot; TO consider whether, having regard to the changing methods of dealingwith offenders, any changes are necessary in the arrangements for theadministration of justice by courts of assize and quarter sessions with a view,in particular, to ensuring that these courts, before passing sentence, have adequate information about the circumstances of offenders convicted beforethem; and to make recommendations.&quot;If it is agreed that the appointment of a Royal Commission should be recommendedwe think that the intention to appoint one should be announced in the Queen&apos;sSpeech.
conclusions.   We recommend (a) that a Royal Commission should be appointed with terms of reference onthe lines suggested above. (We would agree the precise form of wordswith the Prime Minister);(b) that the intention to appoint the Commission should be announced in the queen&apos;s Speech;(c) that reference should also be made in the Queen&apos;s Speech to the HomeSecretary&apos;s intention to press on with projects of penal reform.R. A. B.K.17th October, 1957.
