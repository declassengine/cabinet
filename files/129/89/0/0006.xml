THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1957SECRET Copy No. 5C. (57) 20620th September, 1957CABINETBETTING AND GAMING bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy seal at their meeting on 30th July (C.C. (57) 59th Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet invited me to circulate the draft heads of clauses for a Betting and GamingBill. This is to be found in the Appendix to this paper.Registration of Bookmakers2. The proposals in the Appendix follow the Royal Commission^ Report andare unlikely to be controversial.Off-the-course Betting3. No provision is made for a statutory financial contribution to be madeto horse-racing from off-the-course betting.4. I propose that the problem of factory runners should be dealt with by making no change in the present law. The collection of bets in a place of work is not at present unlawful provided that it is not carried out from a fixed position,and there is no prohibition on the payment of commission by bookmakers to theirrunners. This proposal involves the rejection of the Royal Commission^recommendation that the payment of remuneration by bookmakers to their agentsshould be prohibited. This proposed prohibition has been criticised on the grounds that it would be unpopular with workers and unenforceable. I think this criticismis well-founded.The critics have proposed an alternative scheme for the licensing of runners.I think that this would present great difficulties in practice; and I cannot as atpresent advise intent or devise any scheme that would give formal legal recognition to a system under which an employee can use his employer^ time and premisesfor his own private business. The implications for industrial relations and discipline would be unfortunate.My proposal to leave things as they are will not please the anti-gamblers; butin my view either of the proposed remedies would be worse than the disease, suchas it is. This is a controversial matter within our Party ranks. I can find nomeasure of agreement there.Pool Betting on Horse-racing5.  This part raises no major point of controversy-Gaming6. The proposals of this part do not exactly follow the recommendations ofthe Royal Commission, which have been found to be impracticable in some respects.The proposals will be controversial only in matters of detail.52282
Other Recommendations of the Royal Commission7. The Royal Commission made two recommendations affecting greyhound racing which need not, at this date, be implemented. The first was a proposaldesigned to reduce the opportunities for attendance at greyhound tracks on morethan two days a week in large urban areas. The Ministerial Sub-Committee ofthe Home Affairs Committee which considered the Commission^ Report in 1953advised against its adoption. The second recommendation was that, to preventexcessive profits by track owners, there should be a reduction in the proportion ofstakes on the totalisator which may be retained by the owner where the totalstakes exceed a specified amount. This recommendation has become academicon account of the fall in profits which has occurred since the Report was issued.The omission of these two recommendations may be mildly controversial.Scotland8. It is intended that the Bill should apply to Scotland and I understandthat some of the provisions in the Appendix will require adaptation to suitScottish conditions, though no major differences between the two countries areenvisaged.conclusion. I have done as my colleagues requested and circulated the heads ofa Bill. I await comment, without entering into the merits or demerits of introducing legislation.R. A.
