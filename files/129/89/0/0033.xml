C.(57) 23314th October, 1957CABINETCIVIL AVIATION;  BRITANNIA aircraft memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation have a threefold responsibility with regard to Britannia aircraft.I take a much less hopeful view about its future than the Minister ofSupply in his memorandum C. (57) 228.(l) lam responsible for the Certificate of Airworthiness. Considera-tion of its withdrawal for both types of aircraft might well have to be givenbut for the effect of this on Bristols.(2) The short-term future of British Overseas Airways Corporation(B.OA.C.) depends on the Britannia.    Their views are set out in detailbelow but they would certainly refuse to fly this aircraft to-day if any alternative type was available.(3) I have a responsibility for civil aviation as a whole.    Its reputation-tion is being seriously damaged by the inability of the Bristol Aircraft Co.to keep its promises on delivery and performance.2.     B.O^.,C&apos;s experience with the Britannia has been unhappy and costly.    The nineteen months&apos; delay in bringing the Britannia 102 into service entailed a net loss to B.O.A.C. of some  3 millions.    delays in the 312 series are likely to cost B.O.A,C. at least  2 millions in thecurrent financial year and every month&apos;s delay thereafter will add over 500,000 to their losses.    These figures, large as they are, do not represent all the economic penalties the Corporation may suffer.    the cumulative effect of the retardation in the planned rate of growth of theCorporation is incalculable.3.     In addition to the financial losses and the retardation in planned expansion, the delayed deliveries create almost insuperable crew trainingproblems for B.O.A.C.4.     The Britannia 312 was planned to come into service in 1956/57and would have maintained the competitive position of the corporation on the North Atlantic until the introduction of the new jet types.    Theseare due in 1960 and the Britannia delays are eating away the period of useful service of the turbo-prop aircraft,5.     B,O.A.C&apos;s increasing anxieties have been aggravated by the newtroubles experienced at Miami.    B.O.A.C. would not subscribe to theview that a simple modification will necessarily cope with this until the copy NO.-1-irI.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYf3 GOVERNMENT)
engines have been stripped and examined.     In face of all the difficulties and delays and of their own need to have additional capacity available forthe summer of 1958, if not before, B.O.A.C. are profoundly dissatisfied with the speed at which the task of getting the Britannia right hasprogressed;  and they are equally dissatisfied with the prospects for thefuture.    They are also concerned that, if the aircraft were put into service with the operating limitations necessary while the icing troublespersist, great practical difficulties will arise in conforming with air traffic control requirements at airports on the eastern seaboard of north America; this could well result in harmful publicity.    B.O.A.C.are also concerned because crew morale is being affected by the troublesexperienced with both marks of aircraft.6.     Against this background the Chairman has just informed me that,unless the engine defects can be remedied by April, 1958 and the aircraftmade ready to use on trans-Atlantic services for the summer of thatyear, the Corporation would be unwilling to accept the aircraft;  in that event they would have to buy (or hire) some other aircraft.    B.O.A.C.consider themselves contractually entitled to decline to accept furtherdeliveries.    Furthermore^ the Corporation consider that, even if this date can be met, they should in some way be compensated financially.One possibility they mention is for the aircraft to be purchased by her Majesty&apos;s Government and hired to the Corporation for such period as they will have a useful competitive life.7.     It is clear from the attitude of B.O.A.C. that they would be unwilling to accept delivery of any further Britannias at present - whether on order for them or for North East Airlines or to make any further payments to Bristols.    (I should perhaps point out that North EastAirlines&apos;main reason for postponing acceptance of these aircraft wasthat they could not be delivered in time for this year&apos;s Florida touristseason.)    In any case, the suggestion of the Minister of Supply thatB.O.A.C. should contribute any further to the costs of getting the aircraftright is clearly unacceptable.8.     I must carefully examine the latest views of B.O.A.C. and discuss them with the Chairman.    But I should not feel justified in attempting to dissuade B.O.A.C. from their present attitude so long as the puttingright of the Britannia is left solely in the hands of Bristols.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.14th October, 1957.
