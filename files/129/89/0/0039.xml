secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet; October 1957C. (57) 239 Copy No.18th October, 1957CABINETCOMPULSORY ACQUISITION: COMPENSATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs understand it may be suggested, at an early meeting of the Cabinet, that aBill to alter the law of compensation on compulsory acquisition should beintroduced this coming session.2. I have hitherto been proceeding on the assumption that, although there could be no possibility of squeezing a complex and controversial Bill of this kindinto the 1957-58 programme, a place might be found for it in 1958-59. This is what I would favour.3. I do not think that earlier legislation is practicable. The subject is highlycomplicated, and Ministers have not yet held any discussions on it. My intention is to submit a Paper on the subject to the Home Affairs Committee within thenext few weeks; but I shall be surprised if we find it easy to reach decisions. what we shall be doing, of course, is considering bow to amend Conservative legislationenacted as recently as 1954. While the existing compensation code is rooted inthe Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, it was our legislation which deliberatelyretained it while getting rid of other features of that Act; and we did this knowingthat the changes we were making would be liable to create just the difficulties that have arisen.4. I well know the dissatisfaction with the present basis of compensation.Broadly, it provides that the acquiring authority shall pay only the current market value of the land in its existing use, together with any development value that theland may have had in 1947. Where the land has acquired development value since1947, therefore, the price paid by the acquiring authority is less it may be much less than the owner could get in the open market. This naturally looks extremelyunfair. There is also the difficulty that, in view of the fall in the value of money,the 1947 development value itself is now worth a good deal more than it wasassessed at in 1947.5. A further trouble is that where an authority exercising compulsory powers have bought, at the above restricted value, land which subsequently proves surplus to their requirements, the price at which they are obliged to dispose of it is fullmarket value. They may thus find themselves offering land back to the originalowner at a great deal more than they paid him for it. This situation, even thoughit arises infrequently, can cause intense feeling.6. Nevertheless there were good reasons why the Government in 1952 decidedto retain the restricted value on compulsory acquisition, while abolishingdevelopment charge and setting the private market free. These reasons were setout briefly in the White Paper Cmd. 8699 (paragraphs 30 and 31) presented toParliament by the Prime Minister when he was Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment. They were developed more fully in H.A. (52) 79 which he circulatedto Home Affairs Committee. The relevant paragraphs of that Paper are appended.52415
7. To adopt market value instead of restricted value on compulsory acquisition looks, at first sight, simple and attractive. But we must pause and see what it would involve. Take the case of agricultural land which acquires buildingvalue through the provision, at public expense, of roads and sewers and watersupply. If it is then agreed that the land is suitable for building, its value may heincreased from (say)  50 an acre to as much as  1,000 an acre, or even more in areas where, as a result of planning restrictions, building land is in short supply.If that land is then needed for any public purpose, the public whether as taxpayeror as ratepayer in effect has to pay twice.8. It was this sort of situation which, I believe, influenced the Governmentin 1952 to adopt the solution contained in the 1954 Act. Unearned increment onthe scale indicated is hard to defend, and has considerable political implications.Apart from anything that the Opposition may say, and threaten to do, we must recognise that if public authorities are required to pay market value, they are bound as prudent guardians of the public purse to try to buy well in advance allthe land they may possibly need and whose value they may be going to increase.9. To overcome these and suchlike difficulties it has in the past been suggestedthat if the market value basis is adopted, some form of levy should be imposed onunearned increment in land values. Any such plan raises grave doubts in my mind;but in default of any other solution it would have to be examined.10. One suggestion made by the Prime Minister in HA. (52) 79 (paragraph 15)was that in due course it might prove necessary to adjust the amount to be paidby way of compensation to take account of a decline in the value of money. Heindicated something like this in the Committee debates on the 1954 Act (StandingCommittee C, June 1, 1954, col. 535). I do not think that if we legislated we shouldbe able to do that and stop there. It would also be very difficult not to apply thesame adjustment to compensation for planning restrictions.11. The fact is that the reason for the present compensation code stems fromthe necessity for planning control. I will not here attempt to go over the arguments that led to the 1947 Act. That Act was accepted in principle by our Party when wewere in Opposition because we believed in the necessity of planning control andknew that that must involve limitation of compensation. In all the changes we havemade, we have retained the principle that, for planning restrictions, compensationis limited to the amount established by the claims for 1947 development value.That has been generally accepted; but if we alter the basis of compensation on compulsory acquisition, we risk an attack on the basis of compensation for planningrestrictions.  That could be disastrous.12. It may be argued that we can and must sweep all these questions asideand go straight for market value on compulsory acquisition. But simple market value will not do, since in some cases the effect of planning is to depress the valueof land below what would be paid in accordance with the present restricted -value.There are technical problems to be solved here.13. In terms of legislation, to alter the basis of compensation meansamending Part IV of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, as amended bythe Town and Country Planning Act, 1954. This will be a tricky Parliamentaryoperation, for as soon as we start amending these Acts we shall of course be subjectto all sort of pressures to relieve landowners from the effects of planning control.Yet we certainly do not want to see planning control fatally weakened. We shall then have &quot; Subtopia &quot; unlimited: uncontrollable seizure of agricultural land: anda St. James&apos;s Theatre outcry daily!14. Despite the difficulties and the risks, I want to find a way to legislatebefore the Election that is, in 1958-59. But in my view we could not possibly beready in time for the 1957-58 session, with a Bill that would stand up to criticism.That is my judgment; I shall be interested to hear the views of the several other ministers who are directly concerned, including of course the Chancellor of theExchequer.H. B.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,17th October, 1957.
appendix extract from H.A. (52) 79        .-. \\ %15. The proposal to limit the compensation to 1947 development values is,I think, defensible. That is as much as (indeed in most cases more than) anyonehas expected to get since the 1947 Act was introduced. I believe that this would be generally accepted at the start at any rate. In time individual owners might think it inadequate; particularly if the value of money declines further. Butwe should get rid in the first few years of the strongest and most urgent cases for compensation; and if thereafter we had to adjust the amount to be paid by way ofcompensation, to take account of a decline in the value of money, that would notbe fatal..-16.  The main political difficulties would be these:  (i) Where permission is given for profitable development the land-owner would keep the profit from the land. The Socialists would make this the main point of attack.  It would be &quot; reactionary.&quot;(ii) If, with the free market in land restored, public authorities had to buy at thefree market value, the political attack would be formidable and the practical results would be serious. The value of the land authorities needed to buy (e.g., for housing)might have been increased by what they themselves had done; by the fact thattheir plan concentrated development in a limited area, or kept adjoining land open;or the value might have been increased by improvements carried out at public expense, all the old arguments about &quot; unearned increment &quot; would be raised. this difficulty could, however, be avoided if we provided that the basis for compulsory acquisition should be the existing use value prevailing at the time the purchase ismade, plus the claim for the 1947 development value. That would leave the ownerwhose land is bought exactly where he is under the present Act (except that his claim would be paid in full); and would treat him in precisely the same way asthe owner who is not allowed to develop. But it would mean that the owner whois forced to sell to a public authority would get a worse price in some cases a much worse price than the owner who sells privately, or develops his own land.(iii) There would be no equality of treatment. Owners allowed to develop their own land, or to sell it for development, would keep the profit. Owners not allowed to develop, or forced to sell to a public authority, would get nothing but its value for existing use plus the claim if any. The difference in some cases couldbe large, and would get larger if and when 1947 development values became lass and less related to current development values. Few would incur actual loss(though the proposed exclusions from any title to compensation for certain kinds of restriction might have this result in some cases); but some would lose the chance to make a profit which others would get.(iv) It would be very difficult to satisfy all the people who are out of pocketas a result of the past 5 years. We should probably have to repay charge to people who hold a claim; and to pay the claims to people who have been compelledto sell their land at existing use value. But many people who have paid charge especially people who have paid charge on building a house and who have been soanxious to get a site that they have not stopped to work out the trouble in storefor them have no claim, having bought the land without getting it; to do anythingfor them would mean disentangling the facts about the price at which they bought,and trying to sort out the rights and wrongs between vendor and purchaser. Manyprivate transactions in land have been affected by the Act, land having been soldat sometimes less than its full value because the owners expected to be paidsomething on their claims some day. I do not think that we could unravel all these.(v) We might have to reopen the right to make claims. Some people failedto make them; but nobody knows how many.17. I am advised that there would be serious technical difficulties in making1947 development values the basis of compensation to be paid in 10, 20 or 30 years&apos;time. The land would split up meantime and the agreed claims would have to be apportioned; the interests on which the values have been assessed would havealtered; and so forth.   There would also be difficulty in deciding when a claim
ought to be paid. Many, such as the owners of green belt land close to the towns,would have to be paid in the first two or three years; but many claims arise on land which nobody really intends to develop&apos;fOr a long time. I think these difficultiescould be surmounted, though no doubt in a rough and ready way; but the fact of them would increase the pressures on the scheme. There would be contentiouscases.These difficulties arise equally on scheme (ii) above.
