secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957C. (57) 240 .    Copy, No18th October, 1957 - )CABINETTHE AGRICULTURE ACTSMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorAs my colleagues know, the operation of the provisions of the AgricultureActs the Agriculture Act, 1947; the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948; the agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act,1949 which relate to security of tenure and confer disciplinary powers on the agriculture Ministers has given rise to serious concern and misgivings in recentyears.2. Ministers considered these matters at length in 1955 and 1956. It wasnot questioned, in any of the discussions then, that the security of tenure provisionshad come to operate in such a manner as to give a quite unexpected, and unintendeddegree of security to the tenant farmer. This was not in the best interests ofagriculture; the landlord/tenant system was being slowly undermined; and it hadalready become extremely difficult for young farmers to acquire, except by purchase,holdings to farm themselves. There was equally little dispute that the Governmentwere confronted with acute and potentially embarrassing difficulties in theirexercise of the disciplinary powers over the farming industry, and that the futureof these powers needed re-examination.3. The Cabinet decided, in 1956, that, in preference to appointing anindependent enquiry to go into these questions and to prepare farming and publicopinion for eventual legislation, it would be better for the Agriculture ministers to attempt to discover, in discussion with the farming and land-owning interests,what measure of agreement on these issues could be reached. If enough common ground could be established, legislation might be considered (CM. (56)31st Conclusions, Minute 5). Discussions have therefore taken place, withencouraging results, with the Country Landowners&apos; Association and the national farmers&apos; Union, and the corresponding Scottish bodies.4. Meanwhile, it has become necessary to contemplate, in any event, early legislation to give effect at least to the principle underlying those recommendationsof the Franks Committee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries which relateto the functions of agricultural tribunals and the semi-judicial functions at presentdevolving on the Agriculture Ministers. This legislation, although covering onlya part of the field which has been under review, would involve the considerableamendment of Part II of the Agriculture Act, 1947, so that public debate would befocused inevitably on the controversial question of the need for the disciplinary actions and the performance of the Agriculture Departments in exercising them.Even if this particular legislation is deferred until the session of 1958-59 and the agriculture Ministers take the view that it will not be easy to delay it so long anearly announcement of the Governments intentions on these particularrecommendations of the Franks Committee will have to be made, and opportunityfor debate afforded.5. The discussions which have taken place with the agricultural interests have led to a quite unexpected measure of agreement considered to be unattainabletwo or three years ago between landowners and farmers on a basis for introducinggreater flexibility into the statutory provisions governing security of tenure. It isnow possible to contemplate corrective legislation which would be broadly acceptable to both sides of the landlord / tenant relationship.52413b
.,6. No similar agreement has been reached on the question of disciplinary actions. The landowners would like to see the Government retain these powersand, perhaps surprisingly, so would the farmers. This attitude, however, naturallytakes no adequate account of the embarrassment of continuing to possess powersof discipline which can no longer be exercised on any generally acceptable basis.The Agriculture Ministers are satisfied that the only satisfactory course is to repealthese powers and that this would in fact meet with no serious resistance in theagricultural world.7. Although it is not to be expected that landlords and farmers could bebrought to actual agreement on the subject of rents, informal soundings haverevealed the prospect that a sensible amendment could be made to the law withoutthe generation of too much heat. Rents have lagged far behind the landlords&apos; costs,and it is urgently necessary that arbitrators should be required to have regardto current market values in settling rents if damage to the long-term interests ofour farming land is to be avoided.8. In view of the relative success achieved in these negotiations andconsultations,. and taking into account the independent pressure now exerted bythe recommendations of the Franks Committee,,the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture are strongly of the opinion that long neededlegislation to bring the Agriculture Acts up to date in respect of all these various matters should be undertaken without delay, and that the time is ripe for doing so.The proposed legislation, in addition to repealing the disciplinary powers andamending the existing statutory provisions concerned with security of tenure andrents, would provide, in accordance with the recommendations of the franks committee, for the transfer to independent tribunals of the semi-judicialresponsibilities at present devolved on the Agriculture Ministers.9. The opportunity would also be taken to correct a serious anomaly whichthe Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, introduced into the law governing bequest ofand succession to agricultural tenancies in Scotland. The consequences of thenew provisions made in 1948 were not fully foreseen at the time, and they have proved most unfair to landowners. No agreement between Scottish landownersand farmers can be expected on this issue, which would therefore be controversialas between the Scottish interests directly affected.10. A Sub-Committee Of the Home Affairs Committee, under my chairmanship, have been considering in detail the scope of this legislation and the justification for it. Their conclusions are set out in the annexed report. Theproposed legislation would be in accordance&apos; with Conservative Party principles andwould be in the general economic interest of the country. Much of it would be popular with the Parliamentary Party, and a good proportion of it would be basedon an agreement between the landowning and farming interests. Such an agreement is unlikely to prove enduring unless advantage is taken of it promptly; and the projected legislation, if not introduced in the next session, would not be suitablefor a later session of this Parliament. In any event, the Country Landowners&apos;Association, having shown considerable flexibility in reaching accord with theNational Farmers&apos; Unions on security of tenure, are bound to feel that theGovernment have failed them if, after protracted discussions, no further action is taken.11. On the other hand, the projected legislation despite the measure ofagreement on which it would be founded would clearly be contentious in certain respects. The agricultural legislation of 1947-49 was bipartisan in character and supported by the Conservative Party. Proposals to amend it in the directionsenvisaged will certainly provide scope for possibly keen controversy as between theGovernment and the Opposition; and any legislation on such subjects as tenure,rents and agricultural discipline is both susceptible to misrepresentation and capableof causing confusing eddies in the public mind.12., Nevertheless, it is not a question of legislating or not legislating, exceptin the unlikely event of the Government deciding to reject the relevantrecommendations of the Franks Committee. The real choice would appear to lie between (a) legislation confined to the provisions necessary to give effect to therecommendations of the Franks Committee; and (b) taking advantage of theimportant measure of agreement which has been reached with the interests concerned to introduce a more Comprehensive and constructive measure.    The
Sub-Committee take the view that, as between these alternatives, the second courseoffers a definite balance of advantage; that, given the measure of agreement betweenthe interests directly concerned, the political difficulties should not beinsurmountable, and that the proposed legislation satisfies the tests to which legislation for the next session must if possible be subjected.House of Lords, S.W. 1.17 th October, 1957.AnnexLEGISLATION TO AMEND THE AGRICULTURE ACTSReport of a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs committee we have considered proposals of the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Agriculture for legislation to amend the provisions of the AgricultureActs and the Agricultural Holdings Acts relating to:  (i) security of tenure;(ii) disciplinary powers over the agricultural industry;(iii) agricultural rents;(iv) law of succession to agricultural tenancies in Scotland.2. ^Amending legislation to deal with the first two of these matters has beenunder review since 1955. Such legislation, although still providing scope forcontroversy, can be expected to be a good deal less contentious than it wouldhave been two or three years ago because, in discussions which have taken place,both the landowning and the farming interests have adopted, a perhapsunexpectedly understanding attitude. Meanwhile, the report of the franks committee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries has made it necessary to envisage legislation to give effect to the recommendations of that Committee-orthe principle underlying those recommendations relating to the jurisdiction of theAgricultural Ministers both in cases of disputed tenancies and over appeals brought by persons against whom the disciplinary powers are invoked. The fact that legislation, concerned with a limited part of the field we have had under review,must now be contemplated in any event clc 3,1*1 y ii as a close bearing On the questionwhether given the relatively co-operative attitude which the farming industry has taken up-this legislation should not be expanded into a considerably more constructive and needed measure. We therefore begin with the questions arisingout of the Report of the Franks Committee.Transfer of Functions from Minister to Independent Tribunals3. The Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948 (Sections 24 and 25), and thecorresponding Scottish legislation, confer on the tenant farmer who is served witha notice to quit a right of appeal in certain circumstances to the Minister. the landlord is then required to justify terminating the tenancy on one or more of anumber of stated grounds: namely, that this would be in the interests of efficientfarming; that the land is needed for.research, education, small-holdings, allotments,of is wanted for a permissible non-agricultural use; that, in certain circumstances,failure to.authorise eviction would cause the landlord greater hardship than thetenant.   : &apos;4. The Agriculture Act, 1947 (Part II), and the corresponding Scottishlegislation, confer on the. Agriculture Ministers a statutory power to place owners and occupiers of agricultural land under supervision if they are not farming ormanaging the land satisfactorily; to serve directions requiring an. improvedperformance; and, in the last resort, to dispossess those who fail to show satisfactory progress under supervision.5. The Ministers&apos; statutory powers to arbitrate between landlord and tenantin disputes, over notices to quit, and to exercise discipline over the agricultural industry, have been delegated in practice to the: County Agricultural Executive52413
Committees. There is a right of appeal on both matters from the Ministers&apos;decision given through the County Committees to the Agricultural Land Tribunals(and in Scotland to the Land Court), whose decision is final, except for the rightof further appeal to the High Court (or the Court of Session) on a question of law.The Franks Committee rather severely criticised the vesting of adjudicatingfunctions in these Committees particularly in regard to the disciplinary provisions,5 irij the enforcement of which the Committee could be held &quot;to combine thefunctions of detective, prosecutor and judge.&quot; As the Committees were delegates of the Minister, this also infringed the principle of visible impartiality.6. The Minister of Agriculture proposes to transfer the function of arbitratingany disputes over notices to quit from the County Agricultural Executive committees to the Agricultural Land Tribunals bodies whose chairmen and members are appointed by, or under the supervision of, the Lord Chancellor and are thereforeindependent of the Minister. No need is seen for an appeal from the decision ofa Tribunal, except to the courts on a point of law.7. Although both the landlords and the farmers would prefer the agricultural ministers to retain their judicial responsibilities they are considered unlikely to resistthis proposal. The proposed arrangement would conform with the principle that the landlord is entitled to do what he thinks proper with his own land, subject to theright of the tenant to appeal to some judicial body against arbitrary or unreasonableaction. The Secretary of State for Scotland proposes that the Land Court should become a Court of first instance in place of the Agricultural Executive Committees.An appeal on a point of law, if competent, would go to the Court of Session.8. If the disciplinary powers are to be repealed as we recommend below no further problem of overhauling the machinery for exercising them will arise.If, however, these powers are to be retained, it will clearly be necessary to considergiving effect to the recommendation of the Franks Committee that new tribunals,independent both of the Minister and of the County Committees (and before whomthe latter would then merely give evidence), should assume jurisdiction in caseswhere a farmer appeals against the imposition of disciplinary sanctions on him.The Franks Committee also recommended that an initial supervision order,although intended to help the farmer, must itself be regarded as a penal sanction,and the farmer or landowner given the right which he does not possess now to appeal against it.9. The prospect of such legislation would be embarrassing. In point of fact the disciplinary powers have fallen into virtual disuse and cannot now easily be revived. We discuss in greater detail below the problems arising in regard to these powers and recommend that they should be repealed. The introduction, at the instance of the Franks Committee, of new arrangements for the administration ofthese powers would be certain to focus attention on their utility and on the extentto which they have been allowed to fall into abeyance. A decision to retain these powers would therefore confront the Government with embarrassing and difficult problems to which we can see no solution.10. (The County Committees also exercise judicial functions in approvingshort-term tenancies and dealing with applications from tenants wishing to carryout long-term improvements to which the landlord does not consent. It will need to be considered, as a separate matter, whether these functions should not now betransferred to the Agricultural Land Tribunals.)11. We endorse the proposals in paragraphs 6 and 7 above under whichthe Agricultural Ministers would be divested of any responsibility for arbitratingbetween landlord and tenant in cases of disputes over notices to quit, and theresponsibility for adjudicating in these cases would be transferred to theAgricultural Land Tribunals or, as appropriate, the Scottish Land Court, as independent bodies, with a right of appeal to the courts on a point of law.Security of Tenure. 12. The problem here arises frOm the fact that the interpretation which hasbeen placed on the present statutory provisions has caused the administration ofthe law to be weighted unfairly in favour of the tenant. The Agricultural HoldingsActs empower the adjudicating authority whether of first instance or on appeal 
to exercise.a very wide discretion in cases of dispute over notices to quit; andthe practice has grown up of allowing considerations of hardship to the tenantto govern the decision in a great number of cases where consent to a notice to, quitwould in fact be justified on the specific tests laid down and would be in theinterests of efficient farming. - .    .13.. It is through the existence and exercise of this wide power of discretionthat the balance as between landlord and tenant has come to be seriously disturbed.The present law gives much too much protection to the bad or mediocre farmerand is detrimental both to the true interests of tenant farming, by making it virtuallya closed shop, and to the maintenance of a landlord /tenant system on any sound basis. The Agricultural Ministers are satisfied that it is very much in the publicinterest that these provisions should now be amended. There is no question ofrepealing them in their entirety and of leaving the tenant without protection againsta notice to quit. The landlords accept this. And it would be difficult to contemplate legislation on such a matter without some reasonable measure ofagreement between the landlords and the farmers.14. What is required is to redress the balance as between landlord and tenantso as to make it somewhat easier for the landlord to obtain consent to a notice to quit. The landlord would still be required to establish certain matters to the satisfaction of the adjudicating authority, which would in future be able to take into account not only the proposed future use of the land but also its use in relationto any other land with which that land had been or would be farmed or managed,but the general discretion now held by the Minister to withhold consent, even if suchmatters were established to his satisfaction, would be abolished. In the past, consenthas often been withheld, on the ground of hardship to the tenant, in cases where thesematters were otherwise satisfactorily established by the landlord. In future,hardship to the tenant will only be considered when hardship to the landlord isthe ground relied on by the landlord. And then all the circumstances of the case,including the length of time in which the land to which the notice relates has been occupied by the tenant or his family, may be taken into account.The negative provision that the Minister shall withhold his consent unless he is satisfied is to be changed to the positive provision that he shall consent ifsatisfied, &amp;c.15. Amending provisions on these lines are acceptable both to the CountryLandowners&apos; Association and to the National Farmers&apos; Union (subject to one point)and to the corresponding bodies in Scotland. The National Farmers&apos; Union wouldlike to see some element of an overriding discretion retained. It is hoped that further discussion with the National Farmers&apos; Union will elicit more precisely what they want. It may not be possible to give a general overriding discretion to a tribunal concerned with the determination of judicial issues. Subject to this,legislation containing amending provisions may therefore be expected to beuncontroversial as between the interests directly affected. It is not consideredpracticable, nor would it be right, after the existing legislation has been interpretedand applied with a certain emphasis for a period of ten years, to proceed withoutamending legislation but by way of advising the adjudicating tribunals to adoptan interpretation of the existing discretionary power which is more favourable to the landlord. The tribunals are independent of Ministers and it is felt that,after this lapse.of time, the conditions on which tenancies can be terminated mustbe restated in statutory form.16. We recognise that any legislation to adjust the landlord/tenantrelationship in favour of the landlord is likely to provide scope for more generalsocial controversy, of which the Opposition will no doubt take advantage. But wedo not think this consideration should be over-riding, and we recommend that advantage should be taken of the measure of agreement which has been promotedbetween the interests directly concerned to make an important and constructiveamendment to the law.The Disciplinary Powers17. The disciplinary powers in Part II of the Agricultural Act of 1947 and inthe corresponding Scottish provisions were intended to be complementary to thesubsidy provisions of Part I of the Act. They reflect the atmosphere of theimmediate post-war period when food was scarce and;rationed, and the nation had become accustomed to Government intervention in many more matters than it
would&apos; noW willinglytolerate. - The provisions were enforced to a significant extent in the early years of the Act but, because of the difficulty of applying them, graduallyfell into disuse, the number of cases declining from 1,030 in 1952 to 70 in 1955, andto isolated, examples in subsequent years. The Agricultural Ministers are clearlyunder a constitutional obligation to exercise-or, if that is impracticable, to amendor repeal; penal sanctions of this kind which have been placed on the Statute Book;they take the view that it is quite unsatisfactory, from all points of view, for such powers to; continue to exist when no generally acceptable basis for exercising themcan be found. -    ..18. There are, however, objections to all courses of action which aretheoretically possible&quot; (a) The&apos;full exercise of the powers as the law apparently intendedThis is out of the question on all grounds. It would result in a great number of supervision orders, a considerable number of dispossessions, and much relative injustice. The measurement of agricultural efficiency cannot be; made an exact science, especially when the quantity of food production is nolonger the single objective; and it would place an invidious responsibility onthe Agricultural Executive Committees (or whatever other body might beentrusted with the task) to administer the powers in this way. Neither publicopinion nor the farming industry Would now tolerate such a course. Nor isit feasible to revive the exercise of such powers once they have fallen intodisuse. The alternative policy of persuasion and education is now being followed by the Agricultural Departments with considerable success, and theenergetic exercise of disciplinary powers is quite incompatible with this approach.(p) The use of powers in selecting extreme cases for their general deterrenteffectThis is equally impracticable. It would give rise to an even greaterinjustice that a more consistent use of the powers; would be not much lessrepugnant to public opinion; and would provide, as the case of Lady Garbettillustrated, ample scope for misrepresentation of the Governments motivesand competence.(c) To amend the powersNew legislation continuing the sanction of dispossession and without this&apos;   Ultimate sanction disciplinary powers would be nugatory would need to havethe new purpose clearly defined so that Ministers would know when to take theinitiative and tribunals would have a clear basis on which to reach decision.It has proved impossible to devise more limited disciplinary powers which a.   Conservative Government could be expected to enact.(d) The repeal of the powers- This is the straightforward and realistic course, reflecting the impossibility of achieving efficient farming by means of penal sanctions. The justification for it would be that the disciplining of the bad farmer, in a practical world,- must be left to the play of economic forces : the bad farmer will not do very well, even with subsidies;- and. the very bad farmer will eventually ruinhimself. Effective sanctions against the occupier who farms his land in sucha way as to cause damage to other land, e.g. by noxious weeds, are provided in other legislation.Nevertheless the &quot;Opposition will resist such a drastic course, and some- sections of public opinion may. feel that the.bad farmer is being let off toolightly. The disciplinary powers have always been regarded as the equitableprice the farmer must pay for. his subsidies,; and the public mind is quitecapable of being ambivalent to the extent of objecting to the repeal of the. powers, while sympathising with the individual farmer against whom theymay be exercised. Moreover, while the proposed.readjustment of the securityof tenure provisions will expose the tenant farmer to a-greater degree of natural discipline exercised by the landlord, the repeal&apos; of the statutorydisciplinary powers will remove all. penal sanction against negligent owner-occupiers, and owner-occupiers now farm nearly 40 per cent, of bur,, agricultural acreage. The owner-occupier will, of course, be subject to normaleconomic discipline.
(/) Placing the disciplinary powers in reserve, by- anrarten4npnt&apos;-MQvM\Q&amp;dfe?their use only in extreme circumstances. ;   ijThis . would go some way towards&apos;;Jifleeting&apos;;&apos;the:&apos;:objectioriii-&apos;that: thesubsidised farmer was being freed from all penal sanctions,; but-it would beconstitutionally improper to retain reserve powers for which no use was infact intended. &apos;.. &quot; :     ..   a       .-- P&apos;        -;-- m19. The Agricultural Ministers take the view that-the. issue&apos;should;now be faced squarely, the disciplinary provisions repealed and opposition %n$rffitic1$thfirmly countered. In any event, as stated above, the legislation which&quot; Would berequired to put into effect the changes in procedure which would be necessaryin consequence of the Report of the Franks Committee would lead to debate On thewhole system and exercise of these powers, and would reveal that they require thesupport of a complicated administrative machine which now contributes almostnothing to securing the better use of land. The farmers, in wishing to see the powersretained, are concerned lest the repeal of these powers should be regarded asfreeing the Government in any way from their obligations under the subsidyprovisions of the 1947 Act. But the farmers, while wishing to see the powersretained, have no desire to see them exercised with any vigour; their position Onthe matter is quite untenable and it should be possible to assuage their fears by pointing out that subsidies have now been placed on a long-term basis by the new1957 Act. . . &quot;    ;      &quot;   :   . - &apos;-r&apos; -20. It must be for the Cabinet to decide whether, in all the circumstances, itis feasible to repeal these powers outright at the present time. But we are satisfiedthat, on merits, this is the right action to take; and, after considering the matterexhaustively, we are unable to recommend any alternative practicable course. the longer these powers remain on the Statute Book, unexercised, the moreembarrassing their existence will be; and we must reiterate that the need to take action on the recommendations of the Franks Committee will itself prevent thematter from slumbering.Rents21. The landlord, unable to reach agreement with his tenant on an increasein rent, has a right of appeal under the Agricultural Holdings Acts to an arbitrator.The arbitrator must determine &quot; the rent properly payable &quot; for the holding andhas been inclined to do so by reference to the existing rents of neighbouringproperties, so that no movement of rents has taken place comparable with thefigures new tenants are prepared to pay when holdings fall vacant. Agriculturalrents now stand on average at about 50 per cent, above the pre-war level while the landlords&apos; costs have risen to about 300 per cent, of that level, with the result thatthe landlord is not in a position properly to maintain and improve his property.This is not in the long-term interests of agriculture, and it is now a matter of someurgency that the situation should be remedied.22. Although no formal joint consultations have taken place with the landlords&apos; and farmers&apos; organisations, and the formal agreement of the N.F.U.&apos;s toa course of action which would raise rents further would be extremely unlikely,enough soundings have been taken to establish that the farmers recognise that rentshave lagged too far behind prices and incomes, and the Agricultural Ministers aresatisfied that action can be taken without serious opposition from the farmingorganisations. It is proposed, therefore, to amend the law to require arbitratorsto assess rents on the basis of the open market value of the land, i.e., the rent atwhich the holding might reasonably be expected to be let in the open market by awilling lessor. This would exclude unreasonable premiums such as might be offeredsimply in order to gain possession. It is recognised that such premiums are not an easy element to express in a calculation, but valuers are not unaccustomed to doing this in practice and the difficulty is not considered insuperable.23. The farmers&apos; representatives who have been consulted would prefer thematter to be dealt with not by way of amending legislation, but by way of formalor informal guidance to the arbitrators. Arbitrators, although appointed by theMinisters in default of agreement between the parties, are independent of them; andit would not seem that Ministers have any authority even to give arbitratorsguidance on the/interpretation of the Act. The Agricultural Ministers are satisfiedthat, as in the case of security of tenure, it would be impracticable to change theinterpretation of the existing law after this lapse of time and that new statutory
provision embodying a new criterion for the determination of rents is necessary.This would follow the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, in providing that open market values should be the basis for agricultural as for commercial rents.24. The subject of rents, controversial at all times, is especially so now but,balancing more general political considerations against the degree of understanding which farmers have shown on this issue, we recommend that the proposed legislation should include a provision to place agricultural rents on an economic basis.Succession to, and Bequest of, Agricultural Tenancies in Scotland25. As the law in Scotland stands at present an heir-at-law or legatee maysucceed to the tenancy of an agricultural holding and continue to have theprotection of the existing provisions with regard to security of tenure. The heir-at-law or legatee may have taken no part in the running of the farm, may not beemployed in agriculture, or may even be abroad. The Secretary of State forScotland proposes to bring the Scottish law on this subject broadly into line withthe English law by abolishing the right of bequest and restricting the right ofsuccession to the unexpired portion of a lease.26. We endorse this proposal. The Scottish Landowners will support it. TheScottish National Farmers&apos; Union will object, particularly on the ground thatcertain tenants, under the safeguard provided by the existing law, have sunk, or would sink, more capital in their holdings than they would otherwise do. This,however, is a matter which is taken care of by the law with regard to compensationfor improvements.Application of the Legislation to Scotland27. The proposed legislation, if it is confined to the subjects considered inthis report and does not involve any more general amendment of the agriculturallegislation, can be embodied in a single Great Britain Bill, without need fora separate Bill for Scotland. In that event, it will be desirable to make special arrangements for the Parliamentary handling of the provision in the Bill which willbe concerned with the law of succession to, and bequest of, agricultural tenancies inScotland. It would be undesirable for this provision, which will be contested byScottish farmers, to be referred in the normal way to a Standing Committee onwhich there would be few Scottish members. We understand, however, that itwould be practicable (though not perhaps customary) to remit this single provision in the Bill for consideration by the Scottish Grand Committee. This would be apreferable course to making this particular provision the subject of a separate short bill and we recommend that it should be followed.General Conclusion28. We are satisfied that there is a very strong case on merits for taking steps,after an experimental period of ten years, to bring our agricultural legislation upto date by an amending Bill to deal with security of tenure, disciplinary powers,rents and the succession to agricultural tenancies in Scotland. The first three ofthese matters are closely inter-related. Farmers as well as landlords have beenbrought to accept the need for more flexible arrangements in regard to both securityof tenure and rents, and the proposed legislation would have the advantage ofbeing based on this. The disciplinary powers have become inoperable, cannot be revived, are out of harmony with the spirit and needs of the times, and their existence is a source of embarrassment to the Government. On the other hand,despite the measure of agreement or understanding on which the proposed legislation would be based, the subjects with which it would deal provide scope for general controversy and misrepresentation of the Government^ motives.Nevertheless, we consider that these objections ought not to be regarded asoverriding, and that the balance of advantage lies in introducing the proposed legislation in the next Session, bearing in mind that the problem of the disciplinary actions will not remain quiescent if no legislation to repeal them is introduced.For it will then become necessary, as stated earlier, to introduce legislation to giveeffect to the recommendations of the Franks Committee which relate to theadministration of these powers, and this will reveal that the powers are not beingexercised and cannot easily be revived. We are agreed that, any legislation on these various subjects should be embodied in one Bill, and that it would be impracticable for the Government to proceed with legislation on these matters in the next Sessionwithout having announced their intention to do so in The Queen&apos;s Speech.
