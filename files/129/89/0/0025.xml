(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;TfC.(57) 225 COPY NO._^ 05th October, 1957CABINETEXPLAINING THE ECONOMIC situation note by the Prime MinisterAt our next Meeting, on Monday, 6th October, the Cabinet will havean opportunity to discuss the party Conference, and particularly the line which Ministers speaking there should take on various aspects of our most pressing problem - I mean, inflation.    It is particularly important that we should use the same terms, and follow Lord Melbourne&apos;s advice.This applies, of course, not only to speeches at the Conference, but in thecountry in the months to come.2.      People see the problem of inflation in the form of prices, or in theform of prices related to wages.    Similarly, they want to know what our recent decisions mean in terms of wages related to employment.3.     On these three topics - prices, wages and employment - we mustall speak clearly and consistently.4.     &quot;We must also speak realistically, and my colleagues might care to have the following points in mind:-Prices5.     Everybody has been encouraged to measure prices against thecost-of-living index.    We cannot ignore the fact that this is almost boundto climb up two or three points over the next few months.    The postal charges increases, some transport and other increases have still to work through from last season&apos;s wage round.    Moreover, the working of the rent Act will have an increasing effect on the index.6.     At any rate, until the Budget, there is no way of correcting thistrend.    We must therefore make it clear that our measures must be judged by the long-term results.Wages7.     Apart from minor and exceptional cases (such as the doctors&apos;claim) the Government has no power to stop wage increases, even in the nationalised industries.    We cannot, in the last resort, prevent arbitra-tion, and there must always be the danger of an unjustified award.
SECRET 1358.      What we can do (indeed what we have done) is to decide that weshall not finance with new money any increase of wages that may emergeeither from arbitration or from private agreement.    We must make boththe limit of our power, and our determination not to issue new money forthis purpose, absolutely clear.Employment9.     The measures we have adopted are the only real protection of full employment.    Even the high degree of &quot;full employment&quot; which wehave enjoyed can be maintained if wages and other incomes are matched by production.    The exact way in which this is stated to the country isof the greatest importance.    We must make it clear that while we willnot finance inflation, we are not attacking employment.    We are asking for a pause, not for a retreat.H.M.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.4th October, 1957.
