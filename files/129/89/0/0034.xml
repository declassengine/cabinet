confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1957C. (57) 234 Copy No.15th October, 1957CABINETTARIFF POLICY : THE commonwealth memorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 19th September the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandumdefining the exact scope of the existing statutory provisions for the exemption of commonwealth goods from protective duties in their application to theindependent members of the Commonwealth and to the Colonies. I was alsoinvited to ascertain the reaction of the independent members of the commonwealth to the possible discontinuance of these provisions. (C.C. (57) 70th Conclusions,Minute 2.)Present Statutory Provisions2. The existing statutory provisions relating to duty-free entry for commonwealth goods are extremely complicated. For historical reasons which arenow largely irrelevant they vary as between goods and countries. Briefly, theposition is that protective duties may not be imposed on goods of the Colonies(which, for this purpose, include Ceylon, Ghana, Malaya and Burma). As regardsthe other independent Commonwealth countries and Eire no duties may be charged on certain goods, e.g., fine chemicals, optical and scientific instruments, dried fruit.Duties at full rate may, and indeed must, be charged on all other goods from anyof these latter countries if the country concerned has no trade agreement with theUnited Kingdom. If a trade agreement is in force duties on these other goods maybe charged (but not the first 10 per cent.), but only if this would not contravene theterms of any trade agreement with the country concerned.3. It would not be possible to reproduce these provisions exactly in the newBill without perpetuating the arbitrary and outdated distinction between dutiescharged under particular tariff enactments which it is a main purpose of the Billto eliminate.4. None of the above provisions applies to the revenue duties, to the&quot; McKenna &quot; duties, i.e., duties on motor-cars, clocks and watches, cinematograph films, musical instruments, or to the duties on goods containing silk or artificial silk. Commonwealth goods have always been liable to these duties, thoughgenerally at preferential rates.Views  of  the  Independent  Commonwealth  in  Relation  to   the  PossibleDiscontinuance of these Provisions5. I explained the matter to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers atMont Tremblant, having previously arranged for a full understanding of it atofficial level and for the circulation of a short memorandum to all delegations. Ioutlined the reasons why we were thinking of discontinuing these provisions in thenew legislation. I emphasised that this would not affect our existing policy in thismatter which would continue to be governed by the provisions of our &quot; Ottawa &quot;trade agreements with other Commonwealth countries. Several of the other commonwealth Ministers and officials indicated complete understanding and acceptance of our proposal, and none offered any objection.  Indeed those who52389CONFIDENTIAL
2CONFIDENTIALmade no comment can reasonably be assumed to have agreed with those who saidthat they considered our proposal entirely reasonable and acceptable. So far asthe independent Commonwealth countries are concerned we can therefore take it that there would be no objection to our making no provision in the Import DutiesBill for the duty-free entry of Commonwealth goods.The Colonies6. This leaves us with the question of the Colonies. It may be held thatrather different considerations appiy to the Colonies because they cannot protectthemselves by formal trade agreements. But this objection seems to me to bemisconceived. Although the Colonies cannot themselves have trade agreements with us they are, for all practical purposes, fully safeguarded by our trade agreements with the independent Commonwealth countries. In any case, whatmatters to the Colonies is not the law of the United Kingdom (which can be amended) but our policy, i.e., whether we do or do not impose duties on Colonialgoods. I propose that we should give the Colonies a public assurance of our policy on this matter during the passage of the Bill but should not include any provision in the Bill itself. There is the further consideration that if we were to retain aprovision in the Bill which prevented us from imposing any duties at any time on colonial goods the independent Commonwealth countries might wish to reconsider the views they expressed (or concurred in) at Mont Tremblant.Conclusion and recommendation. It is not practicable to reproduce in the new legislation exactly the existing provisions relating to duty-free entry for Commonwealth goods; any provision would have to be in general terms which would either go further than the present statutory bar or not as far, and, in practice, I have no doubt that we should haveto go further. This would bring to nothing the steps which we have taken sincethe war to limit the scope of our duty-free guarantees to Commonwealth countries and would clearly weaken us in negotiations with them. For this reason and forthe other reasons which I set out in my paper, C. (57) 201, and in the light of the reaction of other Commonwealth Governments at Mont Tremblant, I am satisfiedthat the right and indeed the only practicable course is to drop the statutory barcompletely.D. E.Board of Trade, S.W.L14th October, 1957.CONFIDENTIAL
