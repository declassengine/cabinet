Recruiting for the Army and the Royal Air Force is alarminglylow.     If we are to secure the immense increase needed to enableNational Service to be ended, we must miss no opportunity to publiciseour intention to improve both pay and conditions of service.    Accordingly,I recommend that paragraph 9 of the Speech should be amended to read:-&quot;The reorganisation of My Armed Forces will be pressed forward, and their emoluments and conditionsof service will be improved. &quot;This commits the Government only to the principle of a pay increase and does not of course pre-judge the amount.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S. W.l.4th October, 1957.
