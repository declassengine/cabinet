THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use oi..1^^..................TOP SECRET Copy No....... .!.0-C57) 212-17th September, 1957CABINETREDUCTION OF HOUSING PROGRAMME: ENGLAND AND WALESMemoranfliim by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentSocially and politically the tenderest spot for attack inthe Governments anti-inflation policy is likely to be its implications for local authority housing.     It may be helpful to the Cabinet,therefore, to have before them the basic housing figures for Englandand Wales.2,       The output of houses in the public/sector has already been falling steeply since the peak year of 1954, as is shown by the figuresof houses under construction at 31st July in each year1954 194,0091955 157,0001956 150,0001957 132,000I expect completions in the calendar year 1957 to be of the order of125,000, which will be a fall of 40 per cent from 1954 (215,000).3.       I have offered to cut the programme of starts to 100,000houses in each of the years 1958/59 and 1959/60.4-       Of this 100,000, about 10,000 will be needed for the twelvenew towns;   I could not slow down the housing development there (which of course is closely linked with the industrial growth) to a substancially lower figure.     This will leave 90,000 for local authorities.5.      Eor local authorities, slum clearance is now the first priority.Our election manifesto in 1955 said:     &quot;We shall root out the slums at an increasing pace, and aim to rehouse at least 200,000 people a year from them&apos;;To achieve this aim, some 65,000 &quot;slum clearance&quot; houses a year are wanted.In addition, about 10,000 houses a year are needed for houses forincoming workers in expanding industrial areas, and for essential&quot;overspill&quot; building under town development schemes.     At most, therefore,some 15,000 out of the 100,000 houses would remain for meeting general needs,6,       The housing shortage is still so acute in a number of areas thatthe authorities are finding it essential to go on building for general needs, even though they get no Exchequer subsidy.     To insist thatgeneral needs building should be screwed down to 15^00^ a year in orderto enable slum clearance (which does not increase the total number of dwellings) to reach 65,000 a year would in all likelihood evoke strongprotests from the local authorities which still have acute housingshortages in their areas.     They could, and no doubt would, argue thatthey were the better Judges of local needs, and that if they thought it right to go on building for general needs at no cost to the Exchequer,rather than for slum clearance with Exchequer grant, they should not be prevented from doing so.
7.       In the context of the Rent Act, where additional dwellingsobviously help more to mitigate our difficulties than the replacement of slums does, it would in my judgment be extremely difficult to resistthis argument.    We are likely therefore not to &quot;be able to achievewithin this Parliament the aim of rehousing 200,000 people a year fromthe slums, although, but for these necessary cuts in the housing programme, I previously had good hopes of attaining it in 1958*H,B0Ministry of Housing and Local Government,S.W.1.,16th September, 1957,
