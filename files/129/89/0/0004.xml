ARAB STATES&apos; BOYCOTT OF ISRAELNote by OfficialsArab Boycott1. In August 1952 the Arab League formally instituted an economic boycott of Israel and subsequently established a Central Boycott Committee to ensure itseffectiveness. This Committee has sought to ensure that throughout the arab states businesses are boycotted which have branch factories, assembly plants,general agents, or main offices in Israel; which grant the concession of the use oftheir name or give technical help and advice to, or are shareholders in, Israelicompanies or firms; and which are associated with the Anglo-Israeli Chamber ofCommerce or similar organisations, or have prominent Zionists on their Board of directors. The Committee is continuing still further to increase the effectiveness of this boycott. An extract from the Committee&apos;s &quot; Rules and Motives &quot; isattached at Appendix A.Effects on British business. This boycott has resulted in serious inconvenience to British trade andsome British businesses have incurred losses of trade and profits. Even moreinconvenience and losses will be caused if the Israelis institute their threatenedcounter-boycott of firms complying with the requirements of the Arab boycott.Some businesses have had to waste much effort on combating rumours, possiblyinspired by their competitors, that they were engaged on trade in Israel andtherefore subject to the boycott. Eight British firms have been placed on the arab league&apos;s black list but have decided to remain in Israel. Six British firms havegiven up some interest in Israel, and a further four have resigned from theAnglo-Israeli Chamber of Commerce in order to avoid the effects of the boycott.A further twelve firms who are threatened with boycott measures are now deciding whether to pull out also. (A list of these thirty companies is attached at appendix B.) Our policy has been to refrain from advising British firms, includingShell, on the policy which they should adopt as a result of the boycott and to leave it to them to decide this on purely commercial grounds.Effects on British Shipping3. Arab countries deny normal facilities in their ports, i.e., for working cargo,bunkering and other services, to ships which have either called at an Israeli portduring a voyage which included a call at an Arab port, or carried contraband(which covers almost any kind of cargo) to Israel on any previous voyage. In thenormal course of trade in the Eastern Mediterranean, cargo liners would call at both Israel and Arab ports on the same voyage; but the Arab restrictions haveforced British shipowners to separate the Israel from the Arab trades, with theresult that their ships cannot be employed in the most economic way. Britishshipowners bear the brunt of these Arab restrictions because they have alwaysprovided most of the shipping services in this part of the world; nevertheless,Scandinavian and other foreign shipowners are similarly affected.Effects on British Oil Interests4. In 1948, before the boycott was formally instituted, the Arabs preventedoil flowing through the Haifa pipeline to the Haifa Refinery (which is owned byConsolidated Refineries which in turn is owned 50 per cent, by Shell and 50 per cent,by B.P.). Immediately this resulted in a loss of about 3 million tons of exportableproducts; but this loss has since been made good by the expansion of refinerycapacity elsewhere and the introduction of additional capacity (tankers andpipelines) for transporting oil.5. In December 1955 the Arab Oil Committee recommended that all arab countries should send an ultimatum to Shell and Socony (an American company)stating that they should cease their commercial activities in Israel within six months.(B.P. was probably excluded from this ultimatum through ignorance of the factthat it has an equal share with Shell in the Haifa Refinery and in the marketingorganisation in Israel, Shell Company of Palestine.)  Under pressure from Saudi52238
Arabia, Socony decided to withdraw from Israel within two years. Shell and B.P.have recently decided to follow suit and dispose of their marketing organisation to a buyer with no interests in the Arab States. They have taken this decisionbecause their marketing organisation in Israel is relatively unprofitable and wouldrequire considerable further investment of capital which could be more profitablyused elsewhere. They have not yet taken a decision on the disposal of; the HaifaRefinery which has recently been losing about  200,000 a year as a result of theprice arrangement made by the Government.of Israel and the fact that it can onlyoperate at about 25 per cent, capacity. Any decisions which Shell and B;P: may take on their operations in Israel will not have any serious direct economic consequences for the United Kingdom&apos;s. oil. trade; since: these operations, areinsignificant in relation to Shell and B.P&apos;s. total trade. Nevertheless they mayadversely affect1 Anglo-Israeli trade in general by shaking the Israelis-&apos; confidence in the willingness of British firms to maintain their connections with Israel.Counter Measures6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have protested to the Arab States against theprinciple of the boycott, and have repeatedly stated that they can neither acceptnor condone it. Her Majesty&quot;s Government have likewise made several attempts to organise joint protests.on the part of: ourselves, other European;countries andthe United States; These attempts have proved ineffective because, unlike theUnited Kingdom, other countries are not inrhe difficult position of having exporterswith major interests both in the Arab States and:in Israel, and therefore prefer no.action to. be taken.7. The ineffectiveness of our. general protests has in fact tended&apos; to confirm the Arabs in their belief that we cannot beat their boycott; and they regard theprotests as- prompted more by sympathy for Israel than by purely commercialmotives, Even where we protest against the boycott of an individual firm, we can do- nothing effective unless the firm has. either been falsely accused of&apos; activitiesliable, to boycott or is prepared to abandon those activities. It can be assumed thatthe United States, who are: courting the goodwill&apos;of those Arab States well-disposed to the West, and are havmg their difficulties with Saudi Arabia, will be more than ever reluctant to join in or take the. lead&apos; in further protests against; the boycott;and, without their support, effective measures cannot be taken.conclusion. In these circumstances, any unilateral attempt on our part to oppose the boycott would do more harm than good; and we should restrict our efforts^ tohelping individual firms who may fall foul; of the Boycott Committee.
APPENDIX AExtract from the Memorandum &quot; Israel Boycott : Rules and Motives &quot;published by the principal office of israel boycott for the arab league -. To stop foreign&apos; capital from flowing in Israel, and induce people domiciledthere to leave the country.It is well known that Israel is in need of foreign capital, to create and/orimprove its industries to the point of controlling the markets of the middle east. It has tried using the influence of the Jews abroad over all the big companies and banks to attract foreign capital, especially American. It. succeeded in thebeginning to attract some companies to build some- industries and factories inIsrael and to have some other companies distribute their products to all countries of the Middle East. The danger became clear to the leaders, of the Boycottage as this would help fulfil Israel&apos;s aim. Drastic and strict measures were taken to stopthat danger. The Boycott Liaison Officers took several important decisions whichhighly1 affected the- position&quot; and&apos; hence certain foreign companies refrained fromworking with Israel and others had to- close their branches and industries there.These decisions were as follows:  Importing the products of and dealing with the following companies are strictlyprohibited.(i) Foreign companies having branch factories in Israel:(ii) Foreign companies having assembly plants in Israel; this applies also to companies who have Agents grouping their products there even if itwere for the Agents7&apos;own account.(iii) Foreign companies&apos; who- have general Agents or- Main Offices for theMiddle East in Israel;.(iv) Foreign companies: who grant the- concession of the use-of. their name toIsraeli companies.(v) Foreign companies, firms or institutions-; public or private, who areshareholders in Jewish companies or firms.(vi) Foreign companies who give, technical help- and; advice to Jewish firms.In order that the companies, might- not. contend their ignorance, of&quot; the. above decisions, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs in the Arab countries;; transmitted theabove decisions to the foreign Embassies in the Arab-countries, as well; as tdArabEmbassies in the foreign countries so that they may inform: all, the foreigncompanies who have any arrangement with Israel, contravening with- the saiddecisions, to choose one of the two ways:  A. Either to continue having their branches in Arab-countries and-&apos;close theirbranches in Israel.B. Or to see their products boycotted and branches, closed: in the arab countries should they insist to continue working in Israeli.In order that the result of the above two ways be fruitful to Arab countries,the Boycott leaders requested to give every possible help and the necessaryexemptions to the foreign companies who comply with the Boycott decisions byclosing their branches and factories in Israel and moving them to the arab countries. Most of these countries complied with the above requirements and theresult was very useful to the Arab countries. The Boycott Head Office suggested to the Arab countries in its report for the second half of 1953 to study thepossibility of making an Arab Economical Organisation which draws the attentionof the foreign companies that their economical deals with Israel are of limited results, whereas its economical relations with any of the arab countries have a far better effect and their results are satisfactory to all arab countries. The difference between the local Jewish market concentrated in one small country and the large size of the Arab markets could be attractive to theforeign countries which will encourage the foreign companies to work with theArab countries.
