ANNEX a brief BY OFFICIALS ON COMMONWEALTH TRADE TALKSPart IIntroductionThis brief covers general Commonwealth trade questions and related matters which are to be discussed at the Ottawa meetings of Commonwealth finance ministers. Matters relating to Anglo-Canadian trade are dealt with in a separatebrief.2. Mr. Diefenbaker has publicly expressed a wish to see commonwealth trade increased and has put forward a proposal for a Commonwealth EconomicConference in 1958. In a Memorandum (Annex A to C. (57) 187), the canadian minister of Finance has listed topics which might be considered at such aconference. At the Mont Tremblant meetings, the Canadians hope to seek theagreement of other Commonwealth Governments that a Commonwealth EconomicConference be held in 1958 and to have preliminary discussion on certain subjectsmentioned in the Canadian Memorandum.3. This brief therefore deals first with the line to be taken on the holding ofa Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1958. The subsequent part summarisesour views on the matters on which the Canadians have suggested there should besubstantive discussion at the Ottawa meetings. The final part summarises theWorking Group&apos;s conclusions as to the suitability of the various topics suggested bythe Canadians for inclusion on the agenda of a Commonwealth EconomicConference.Part IIThe question of a Commonwealth Economic Conference4. The Canadian Memorandum proposes for discussion a wide range of miscellaneous topics. These topics and our reactions to them are summarised inparagraphs 16-25 below. It seems unlikely, in the light of past experience, that aConference with so heterogeneous an agenda would yield useful results.5. Nevertheless, we should not adopt a negative attitude to the proposal,particularly as there is no certainty that the Anglo-Canadian trade talks will showpositive results. The new Canadian Administration are well-disposed towards us;and if we and the rest of the Commonwealth appeared to rebuff their initiative theymight encounter serious domestic political difficulties. Since the war, Canada hastended, in the economic field, to move away from the United Kingdom towardsthe United States. This has been due to her being the only Commonwealth countryoutside the sterling area, and the discrimination against her in the trade and payments field which that has entailed; and also to the increased strength of theUnited States economy. Convertibility and the ending of discrimination will do much to remove this. And the present situation offers the kind of opportunity ofarresting this trend which may not recur for a long time. Misunderstanding of our attitude would be likely to arise both in this country and in Canada, particularly as we are at the moment taking a leading part in the negotiations for closereconomic association with Europe.6. There would in any case be advantage in the context of the negotiationsfor the European Free Trade Area if we were.known to have under considerationarrangements which might appear to provide some alternative course. Moreover,whether the European Free Trade Area negotiations are completed next spring or have failed, a Commonwealth Economic Conference might be desirable shortly afterwards to examine the implications.7. At the meeting of Finance Ministers, therefore, we should adopt a positiveattitude. If the general feeling of the meeting is favourable to the idea of aConference, we should take the lead in endorsing it, subject to adequate preliminarypreparations by a meeting of senior Commonwealth officials early in 1958.  If, on
the other hand, other Commonwealth Finance Ministers show that they are notattracted by it, we should seek to rescue the Canadian authorities fromembarrassment by suggesting:  (a) that a special meeting of senior Commonwealth officials should be heldearly in 1958 to discuss (i) the developments in the Europeannegotiations, and (ii) the whole range of Commonwealth economic problems. This meeting could advise Commonwealth Governmentswhether there appeared to be need for a Commonwealth EconomicConference or for some other gathering of Ministers; and would ineffect be the first of the annual meetings of senior officials which hasbeen recommended;(b) that in fact it may well prove desirable to have a meeting of Common-wealth Ministers in 1958 to consider the implications for theCommonwealth of whatever may result from the European Free trade area negotiations.8. In the brief regarding the European Economic Community and Free trade area, the related proposal is also made that there should be meetings of commonwealth High Commissioners in London to keep the European negotiationsunder review. We envisage this proposal being put forward as a separateproposition in connection with the discussions on the European Free Trade Areanegotiations.The location, timing and level of a Conference9. If it is decided that there should be a Commonwealth EconomicConference in 1958, the question will arise of where and when it should be held and at what level. It is important that the Conference should be held in a centrewhich is convenient to reach and where full services can be provided. TheGovernment of whatever country holds the Conference will no doubt provide theChairman and will inevitably share substantially in the responsibility for ensuring that the Conference is a success. As this report shows, the material for aConference at present looks somewhat thin and we would, therefore, not favourhaving the Conference in London if it can be avoided. We think that as theConference was a Canadian proposal it would be appropriate that it should beheld somewhere in Canada (not necessarily in Ottawa) and this would enableMr. Diefenbaker to take the Chair. We do not know whether the Canadianswill wish to have the Conference before or after their Elections which might wellbe in the summer of 1958. A Conference in the spring or early summer wouldbe an inconvenient time for many Commonwealth Finance Ministers. experience has shown that some date between the end of September and January is the most convenient time. If it is not agreed that the Conference be held in Canada itmay become difficult to avoid holding it in India, especially if it is to be in theautumn, because it is proposed that the Bank/Fund meetings should be held nextyear in Delhi. This might prove embarrassing for us because it would involve an Indian Chairman and would lead to a tilt towards the theme of development and pressure for some form of financial assistance to India. Therefore we should try to steer discussions away from this suggestion. We should be prepared inthe last resort to offer to have it in London.10. We have also given some preliminary thought to the level at which this conference should be held. In 1952 the Commonwealth Economic conference was a Conference of Prime Ministers. Given the likely agenda for the present conference if it developed we think it should be rather a Conference of finance ministers and Ministers of Trade and Commerce. This would not preventMr. Diefenbaker from presiding if the Conference were held in Canada. There isa precedent for this. Mr. Menzies presided over the Conference of commonwealth finance Ministers held in Sydney in January 1954.Part IIITopics which the Canadians wish to discuss at Mont Treihblaht11. The Canadian Minister of Finance has suggested that there should be some preliminary discussion during the meetings at Mont Tremblant on UnitedStates commercial policy, wheat, dairy products, and United States action oh lead and zinc. The line we should take on these items is discussed below.
United States Commercial Policy12. The Canadian Memorandum suggests that Commonwealth finance ministers should review together the various ways in which their countries are affected by developments of United States Commercial Policy, including actionstaken under the Trade Agreements Act, surplus disposal operations and otherpolicies and programmes of the United States bearing upon trade. It also statesthat Canada, and no doubt other Commonwealth countries too, will be holdingdiscussions with the United States on a number of trade problems, and it wouldbe helpful to each of them to know in advance the views of their fellow membersof the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom Government have for long followeda policy of keeping other Commonwealth Governments closely informed about our dealings with the United States Government in matters of commercial policy,including in particular any proposals for the acceptance by the United Kingdomof surplus agricultural commodities under United States Aid programmes. Wehave been at pains to give other Commonwealth Governments an opportunity ofcommenting. We would welcome a similar exchange of information and consultation by other Commonwealth Governments and agree that there shouldbe an exchange of views on these topics at Mont Tremblant. The UnitedKingdom&apos;s main interest is in the field of United States tariff policies. Publicityabout discussions of United States commercial policies would need careful handlingas it could be embarrassing to appear publicly to be discussing them.Wheat13. The Canadian Memorandum says that the Canadian Government hasno intention of becoming a weak seller in the wheat markets of the world but is nevertheless prepared to give consideration to the use of a portion of its presentwheat surplus to enlarge the scale of assistance now being made available to commonwealth countries under the Colombo Plan. The Canadians&apos; ideaispresum-ably to sell wheat to India and Pakistan at the rupee equivalent of their normal selling price which would not have the effect of dragging down the world prices of wheat.Moreover, such reduction in Canada&apos;s surplus stocks of wheat as might be achieved by these means would to some extent ease the pressure on the Canadian authoritiesto relax their normal selling price. The scheme would therefore tend in thedirection of maintaining the price of Canadian wheat, although in so far as itcaused Canadian wheat to replace Australian wheat, it might have a loweringeffect on the latter. However this may be and despite our interest which is insomewhat lower wheat prices it will be difficult for us to question any proposals on the lines sketched above because they would be of undoubted value to the food situation in India and Pakistan, which could in some circumstances endanger their political stability, and to their balance of payments.Dairy Products14. The Canadian Memorandum says that Canada, like most majorproducers, must make some special provision in regard to the major dairy products;that this will involve in the future, as in the past, restrictions upon imports, andthat Canada would like to be able to make arrangements with other commonwealth countries that would ensure them of an equitable share of imports.There is no direct United Kingdom interest in this item. It indicates Canadianreadiness to discuss with Australia and New Zealand the possibility of allowingsome imports of these products and in these circumstances we should avoid &quot; takingsides.&quot; At present, Canada allows no imports of butter or Cheddar cheese; poultrywas brought under control in July this year and dried skimmed milk is similarlythreatened.United States action on lead and zinc15. In paragraph 14 of their Memorandum the Canadians say that theywould like to discuss with other members of the Commonwealth the compensatoryarrangements which they might seek in the event of the United States imposing new duties on imports of lead and zinc. The Canadians probably suggested this matter for discussion at a time when they thought the imposition of new United Statesduties on imports of lead and zinc was imminent. It now appears, however, thatno increase in the duties is likely until March or April 1958. Further, if impositionof the new duties is postponed, the United States Government will probably have,or be about to get, by the middle of next year, tariff-reducing powers and the52257 &quot; &quot;      b 2
administration may well seek Canadian agreement to compensation for theincreased duties on lead and zinc being provided by way of reductions in theUnited States tariff. If, however, agreement could not be reached in this way itwould still be open to the Canadians to take retaliatory action under the G.A.T.T.If there is discussion on retaliatory measures we should suggest that additionaltariffs should be imposed on goods which Canada imports generally from theUnited States and of which the United Kingdom is the only other importantsupplier. The brief suggests that &quot; machinery n.o.p.&quot; is the obvious candidate,although in the annex to the brief a number of alternative, but much less significant,items are listed.Part IVSummary of suitability of topics suggested by the Canadians for inclusion on theAgenda of a Commonwealth Economic Conference16. We have now been able to examine the proposals contained in theCanadian Memorandum in some detail. This examination has not led us to changeour initial reactions which were that it does not appear to provide a satisfactory basis for a Conference.17. Certain topics appear definitely unsuitable in our opinion. For example,a review of the price of gold, while of interest to South Africa, would be unlikely to lead to any useful conclusion (if for no other reason than that the United states would not be represented at the Conference) and might well cause undesirablespeculation in the money markets. Discussion of tax treaties would be tootechnical for a Conference of this kind and we do not think that there are any outstanding problems of sufficient importance in this field. We do not think there is scope for useful discussion of trade in uranium and we are most anxiousto avoid discussion, at present of security safeguards against the diversion of fissilematerials to military use, about which there is disagreement between the Canadiansand the Indians. Similarly discussion of shipping matters might well lead toAustralia, New Zealand and Canada &quot; ganging up &quot; on the United Kingdomand it would be much more satisfactory if problems of freight rates could besettled by normal commercial negotiation between the parties concerned. Anothertopic which may prove unsuitable is Commonwealth telecommunications.18. The Canadians&apos; Memorandum also suggests a number of topics fordiscussion under the general heading of Commonwealth investment anddevelopment. We would welcome a Canadian statement saying that they agree in principle to associate themselves with the United Kingdom Government in givingeconomic and financial aid to the West Indies. Whilst we would generally welcomeany increased aid which Canada or other more developed Commonwealth countries could give to the less developed members, such as Ghana or the West Indies, thereare dangers in discussing problems of aid between the donors and the recipients,particularly in multilateral discussions. For our part, given our need for heavyinvestment at home, it must be very doubtful whether we can increase our investment in the Commonwealth at present. New organisational or institutional arrangements will not produce additional capital and we should try and avoid being put underpressure to do more than we are at present. Given this position we could notcontribute much to discussions on these matters at a Commonwealth EconomicConference.19. In the general field of increased Commonwealth trade (as distinct frombilateral matters between the United Kingdom and Canada) the CanadianMemorandum lists a number of topics of interest primarily to the Commonwealthproducer countries (e.g., wheat and wheat disposals, Q.R. on dairy products) onwhich we have a somewhat conflicting interest as a consumer country. We couldnot take the lead in such discussions and would have to watch our position and interests carefully. Paragraph 16 of the Canadian Memorandum, while statingthat Canada is not proposing a new system of tariff preferences, or of restrictionsagainst Commonwealth countries, says that the Canadians would be glad to engage in discussions relating to tariff adjustments. We think that the Commonwealthwill generally support the Canadian view on the undesirability of any new systemof preferences and indeed their attitude to new Commonwealth tradingarrangements in general. In the past, Australia and New Zealand have been the strongest supporters of Imperial Preference, but in our trade negotiations last year with Australia, the question was how far we could maintain existing preferences.
Inter-Governmental arrangements for expanding Commonwealth trade wouldinvolve, on our side, strengthening the protection given in our market to commonwealth food and raw materials; on the side of the rest of theCommonwealth it would involve larger margins of preference for United kingdom goods.20. Discrimination in favour of Commonwealth countries has generally been by means of tariff preferences; it could also be achieved by the use of quotas orby bulk purchase. But these courses would cut across our existing commercial policy and our international obligations. All of them would raise practicaldifficulties:  (a) Both the United Kingdom and the rest of the Commonwealth would thereby injure the trade of foreign countries and have to face retaliation.(b) Increased discrimination in favour of the Commonwealth would be certain to raise a political outcry in the United States.(c) Europe could not be expected to tolerate a free trade area in manufacturesaccompanied by increased preference for Commonwealth foodstuffs.21. There remains the danger of a split in the Commonwealth because nothingsuggests that the Asian members would back increased preference and South Africahas always been lukewarm about giving us worthwhile preferences. NoCommonwealth country would lightly reject an offer of increased preference in theUnited Kingdom market but most seem unlikely to be prepared to give us muchin return.22. It is in any event improbable that the Commonwealth would be preparedto enter into new preferential trading arrangements unless the United Kingdom was prepared to limit her domestic agricultural support. It is the high level of our ownagricultural production which, more than any other single factor, has harmedCommonwealth trade in foodstuffs with the United Kingdom, and the extent towhich this is based on price support has alarmed the Commonwealth. In pressingus to enter into some limitation of our agricultural support the commonwealth would be united and indeed would be urging on us the same course that europe will urge on us in the coming months during the free trade area negotiations. if some such course were regarded as politically tolerable it might be possible to secureCommonwealth trading arrangements which would help our export tradesubstantially. But we have not explored these possibilities further in thismemorandum.23. It seems to us therefore that there is little prospect of launching any major change in Commonwealth trade policy. If unexpectedly anything emerges, itwould be advantageous in terms of our negotiations in Europe to keep it alive andunder examination. It might have a salutary effect on our European partners ifthey thought we had in prospect a new Commonwealth Trade policy. But despite this possibility, it would not in our view be useful to set up continuing discussions of Commonwealth Trade policy, if there were no substance behind the proposals under examination.24. In discussion of trade matters, however, we should welcome any proposalsfor increased trade between other Commonwealth countries and Canada, whichwould tend to improve the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments with the dollar area.The Canadian Memorandum suggests that trade could be increased ifCommonwealth Government tenders were open to suppliers in other commonwealth countries. As far as we are concerned, neither Commonwealthnor foreign countries are excluded from tendering for Public Works Contracts,although no special arrangements are made to ensure that they are given anopportunity to put in their bids, and in practice they may find it difficult to do so.Balance of payments considerations and the protection of United kingdom industry are taken into account in the placing of Government contracts and operate with other commercial considerations to the exclusion of overseas contractors. Ifthe Canadians put forward proposals to remove such restraints as restrict at presentthe placing of Commonwealth contracts in the cheapest Commonwealth market, weshould express ourselves as ready to consider them. But there will be balance ofpayments problems and we should have to take into account the possible reaction of the United States against United Kingdom tenderers for public works there ifthere were to be any question of appearing to discriminate against the United states in the placing of United Kingdom contracts.25. We have also mentioned in paragraph 7 above, proposals for improvedCommonwealth liaison, which envisage annual meetings of senior Commonwealth
Officials. We consider that, whatever is decided about a Commonwealth EconomicConference, this proposal should be put forward. If, however, it is decided tohold a Conference, we do not envisage any formal announcement of new arrangements for Commonwealth liaison before the Conference takes place.Part VConclusion and summary26. For these reasons the Canadian memorandum does not provide asatisfactory basis for a Conference. Several topics seem definitely unsuitable andthe consideration of others is unlikely to lead to useful results. Moreover, it isnot very appropriate to have a Conference to consider a long list of diverse items,most of which do not amount individually to very much. If it is agreed at MontTremblant that there should be a Commonwealth Economic Conference, it wouldseem desirable to secure that the terms of reference agreed for the preliminary meeting of senior Commonwealth officials are such as to enable them to take account of any suggestions that may be made at Mont Tremblant and select both from them and from the Canadian memorandum two or three principal issues.27.   Possible subjects for an agenda would be:  (i) The course or outcome of the negotiations for a European Free trade area, including discussion of the implications of the European common market for the Commonwealth.(ii) United States commercial policies and the disposal of surplus agricultural products.(iii) World trade and payments problems arising from the German positionand possible developments in the United States economy and their implications for the sterling area.(iv) Commonwealth development and investment (to which we should have toagree as an item for the agenda if this were pressed on us).(v) Developments within the sterling area may prove to call for discussion bythe time the Conference meets but it would be premature to make anymention of this at the Mont Tremblant meetings.28.   To sum up (a) the Canadian memorandum does not provide adequate material for a successful Commonwealth Economic Conference (paragraphs 16 to 25);(b) we should however adopt a positive attitude to the Canadian proposalfor such a Conference. If the general feeling of the meeting isfavourable to the idea of a Conference, we should take the lead inendorsing it, subject to adequate preliminary preparations by a meetingof senior Commonwealth officials early in 1958. If, on the other hand,other Commonwealth Finance Ministers show that they are notattracted by it, we should seek to rescue the Canadian authorities fromembarrassment by suggesting-(i) that a special meeting of senior Commonwealth officials should beheld early in 1958 to discuss the developments in the Europeannegotiations, and the whole range of Commonwealth economic problems. This meeting could advise Commonwealth Governmentswhether there appeared to be need for a Commonwealth EconomicConference or for some other gathering of Ministers; and wouldin effect be the first of the annual meetings of senior officials whichwe contemplate;(ii) that in fact it may well prove desirable to have a meeting of commonwealth Ministers in 1958 to consider the implications forthe Commonwealth of whatever may result from the european free Trade Area negotiations;(c) we suggest that, if there is a Conference, it might consider the european free Trade Area negotiations, and the implications of the EuropeanCommon Market for the Commonwealth; world trade and paymentsproblems; developments in the United States Economy and, ifnecessary, investment and development;(d) if there is to be a Conference, we must ensure that agreement isreached that there should be adequate prior consultations between commonwealth officials to secure that as far as possible an agendais agreed upon which would result in a successful Conference.
ANNEX BBRIEF BY OFFICIALS ON ANGLO-CANADIAN TRADE TALKS FOR the ottawa MEETINGSReport by OfficialsOfficials have considered what advice to give Ministers in the light of telegrams from Ottawa Nos. 835, 840, 841, 842, 843 and 854 reporting on the outcome of thediscussions held in Canada by the Minister of Agriculture on the proposal for a free Trade Area between the United Kingdom and Canada, together with theattached note of Sir Frank Lee&apos;s talk with the Governor of the Bank of Canada.2. In the first place, we advise against pressing the adoption of these proposalsfurther on Canadian Ministers at the time of the Ottawa discussions; such a coursewould seem fruitless, at any rate for the present. We suggest that Ministers might take the line that when Mr. Diefenbaker suggested the 15 per cent, switch he had put up an imaginative proposal. We had replied in kind in suggesting the possibilityof developing a Free Trade Area between the United Kingdom and Canada; thiswas a far-reaching proposal which could have transformed the trading and economicrelationships between the two countries, and we would have liked at least to have it fully examined by officials. It is now up to them to say what alternative proposalsthey have in mind for bringing the two countries into closer economic relationship.It will be necessary to discuss with the Canadians what should be said publicly about our suggestion of a Free Trade Area. It is clear that it cannot be kept confidential and the prospect of publicity may help us to keep the question open.3. The next question is whether in these circumstances the proposals outlined in paragraphs 16 to 18 and 24 of Annex B of C. (57) 187 should be put to Canadian ministers. In brief these proposals are for a timed commitment to removediscrimination over say two or three years in return for Canada undertaking, in one form or another, to make a substantial contribution to the United Kingdom gold and dollar reserves. The advice given by Sir Frank Lee (telegram 842, paragraph 3)and by our High Commissioner in Ottawa (telegram 843, paragraph 5) is that theseproposals should not at present be put to Canadian Ministers. We endorse these recommendations. Our High Commissioner says (telegram 843, paragraph 2 (4))that the Canadian Government have deliberately decided to concentrate on a commonwealth Economic Conference and we believe that, if we have given support to their proposals for a Conference, they will be more ready than they appear to beat present to talk bilaterally to us when they have got this idea out of their systemeither as a result of failing to secure a Conference or as a result of the Conferencefailing to achieve very much. All our advice therefore is that this proposal shouldnot be pressed on the Canadians at present. That is not to say that the course ofevents at Mont Tremblant may not make it possible to bring the subject up inbilateral discussion in one way or another and we suggest that the Delegation shouldhave discretion as to whether they raise the question and, if so, in what form.4. The proposal is one which, after preliminary discussion with the Canadians,might become a subject for a Commonwealth Economic Conference, if one is held.The fortification of the reserves is certainly a matter of Commonwealth interest andthe Canadians will be interested in the removal of discrimination by other membersof the Commonwealth as well as by ourselves (though except in the case of Australiathere is not a great deal of discrimination left in the Commonwealth). If the agenda for a Commonwealth Conference looks thin, as it seems to us may well be the case,it would be possible at a later stage, just prior to the official consultations to prepare for the Conference, for us to launch this idea to the Canadians as something whichmight take an important place in the agenda if they were willing to go forward with it; and at such a time, when the Canadians were concerned lest theirConference was a failure, they might be more receptive to the proposal. But no decision on this need be taken now.5. In these circumstances, while we shall no doubt be pressed by Canada to speed up the removal of quantitative restrictions, the right course would be tocontinue to take the line which has been taken over the last few years.  This line
is that it is our policy to remove discriminatory restrictions as soon as we are ableto do so. The timing and order of the removal is a matter for us to decide though we are always prepared to take Canadian views into account. We are, however,under great strain and cannot afford to take risks. The stronger our positionbecomes particularly as a result of expanding our markets in North America the better are the prospects of our being able to remove discrimination more quickly.To this we might add that anything which can be done by Canada to strengthen our position will enable us to proceed with the process of dismantling discriminationmore rapidly.6. The remaining items on the agenda for Anglo-Canadian Trade talks are somewhat thin. They are outlined in paragraphs 20 to 23 of Annex B of C. (57) 187.They may be summarised as:  (a) Canada to send to the United Kingdom a mission of Canadian industrialistsunder the leadership of a Canadian Minister;(b) the issue of directives by the Canadian Government to secure the shift of central Government purchases to the United Kingdom and action bythem to influence the course of purchases by Crown Corporations,Provincial Governments and Municipalities;(c) some modest agreement in the field of tariffs by which the. Canadians wouldbind the existing position in the tariff field where this would be of value to us and where in return they would no doubt expect some limitedremoval by us of quantitative restriction on our imports from Canada.(This would have to be on a non-discriminatory basis as between canada and the United States.)7. It seems improbable that any communique following on the discussions with Canadian Ministers can be very substantial. It will be necessary to bring outthat this has been the first stage in continuing negotiations. There should bemention of whatever can be achieved in the way of Government directives inCanada and of discussions about tariff preferences, on which it will be possible tosay that we are keeping in touch with the Canadians. There could also be mention of any Trade Mission which it is proposed to send to this country. Finally,whatever is agreed to be said about the Free Trade Area proposal will go inthe communique. On their return from Canada Ministers will probably need to demonstrate that the size of the 15 per cent, switch is such that it could not be quickly achieved and indeed could hardly be achieved in the foreseeable futurewithout some definite stimulus to United Kingdom-Canada trade calling for action(by Canada) rather than for exhortation of exporters (by us).8.   We therefore recommend that:  (a) Ministers should not press further the Free Trade Area proposal at presentbut should deal with it on the lines suggested in paragraph 2.(b) The proposals for fortification of the reserves by Canada and the timedcommitment to remove discrimination by us should not be pressed onthe Canadians but the Delegation should have discretion on whetherand in what form they should be put forward if the matter comes up inone way or another during the discussions. The time for these proposals may come later, in the context of a Commonwealth Conference, but this need not be decided now. (Paragraphs 3 and 4.)(c) If pressed to remove discrimination, Ministers should say that it is our policy to do this, but the timing is for us. Anything which strengthensour position will help us to speed up the process.   (Paragraph 5.)(d) We should tell the Canadians that the Diefenbaker proposal for a15 per cent, switch was imaginative and that we had replied in kindwith our proposals for a Free Trade Area. The initiative now lies withthem. We should secure the best arrangements we can for Governmentdirectives in Canada and in the field of tariffs, together with anythingthey offer in the way of a Trade Mission. These should not call for any great return offers on our part.  (Paragraphs 2, 6 and 7.)
NOTE OF A TALK WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THEBANK OF CANADA1. After dinner last night Mr. Coyne took me aside and said that he particularly wanted to impress two things on me.2. The first was that we (i.e., the United Kingdom Government) &quot; must givethese people time.&quot; It would be a great mistake to expect Canadian Ministers tobe ready to take far-reaching decisions at the present juncture, or to be disappointedat their failure to do so. Ministers still had to organise themselves into a coherentand effective team, to learn to work with officials, and to reconcile politicaldeclarations with practical realities. They were almost inconceivably inexperienced.He urged that the United Kingdom Government should make full allowance forthis and should not for instance give any impression publicly that the canadian government was not fulfilling expectations which they might have aroused. Thatwould be harmful to relations between the two countries and would &quot; set back the clock,&quot; in the sense that a Government which was certainly very well disposed towards the United Kingdom and anxious to co-operate fruitfully with us would feel that the United Kingdom had been unreasonable in expecting early andconcrete action when the Government here still had to find its feet. I said thatthat was all very well, but that after all Mr. Diefenbaker had aroused expectationsin the United Kingdom by spontaneous statements about plans for the diversion of trade and so on, and our Ministers would certainly be asked what was going to happen about them. Mr. Coyne said that he fully realised that there was a difficult public relations problem here, and that was why he had spoken to me ashe had done. He repeated that in his view Canadian Ministers could not be expectedto make far-reaching decisions at this time. Indeed he did not himself believe,despite Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s statements, that Canadian Ministers would be prepared,even when they had had more time, to take any really &quot; heroic &quot; measures ofeconomic re-alignment with the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth.Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s statement reflected a real but sentimental wish for such a re-alignment. It was most doubtful, however, whether the Government would inpractice do more than to make minor adjustments in say tariffs, and to give generalencouragement to United Kingdom exporters.3. Mr. Coyne then turned to his second point. He said that he had been greatly interested to hear from Mr. Rasminsky of our proposal for a UnitedKingdom / Canada Free Trade Area. He could not believe for one moment thatthis would be a starter: the difficulties with Canadian industry would be tooformidable. But he recognised that it was a most imaginative concept and onewhich was a logical consequence of Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s original declaration. Therewas nothing &quot; bogus &quot; about it, whereas he felt that some other suggestions whichhad been made from time to time were bogus in that they did not begin to conform with the realities of the United Kingdom/Canadian relationship. I said that I didnot understand what he meant by &quot; bogus &quot; suggestions. Mr. Coyne said that hewas thinking, for instance, of the suggestion that Canada might join the sterling area. I said that I did not think that that idea was being put forward seriouslyby anyone at the present time. Mr. Coyne agreed, but said that some suggestions were being mooted which were not unlike it. For instance, he went on, he had heard of a suggestion (he did not say from whom) that Canada might hold part ofits reserves in sterling. That he would frankly regard as a &quot; bogus &quot; arrangement:it could not conceivably be in the interests of Canada to enter into any such arrangement, since holding part of its reserves in sterling would not really fulfilany real Canadian needs. The only objective would be to strengthen the UnitedKingdom reserves: if that were the purpose in view it would be much better andmore realistic to do it by means of a long-term loan. There would be nothingbogus about that and, speaking for himself, he would certainly not wish to exclude the possibility of such a loan.I deliberately avoided being drawn into discussion on all this. I did, however,think it right to say at one point that, if Canada were to hold part of its reserves in sterling, that would, as Mr. Coyne himself had implied, surely be a striking act of faith by the Canadian Government and people in sterling and in the abiding bonds
between the United Kingdom and Canada. Surely, I said, a loan, precisely because it was designated as a loan, would not have the same psychological effect; it seemedto me conceivable that it might tend to weaken sterling rather than to strengthen it.It was pretty clear, however, that Mr. Coyne regarded this as rather fancy stuff,and he returned to his plea that we should avoid &quot; bogus &quot; suggestions and, if therewere any question of a need to strengthen sterling further, this should be done bymeans of a long-term loan.4. Mr. Coyne said that if I had seen any Press reports implying that hisrelationship with Mr. Fleming was being difficult I was to disbelieve them. He hada very high view of Mr. Fleming and his contacts with him had been easy andcordial.F. LEE,Office of the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom,Earnscliffe,Ottawa.10th September, 1957
