Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1957SECRET Copy No.    4 9C. (57) 21417ih September, 1957CABINETNATIONAL -INSURANCE -REFORMSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in considering the Ministers paper (C. (57) 205), we must not lose sight ofthe wood for the trees. I shall therefore try to limit my comments to the broadissues.2. On August 2nd the Cabinet had before them a graduated scheme whichhad been-considered by the Ministerial Committee (call it the &quot;August scheme &quot;):they asked the Minister to arrange urgently for an alternative to be prepared whichcould suitably include provision for contracting out. He recognises (rightly, Iam sure) that contracting out could not suitably be provided ih the-August&quot; scheme:his paper shows that to achieve this he has had to make big changes. He advisesthat&apos;the result (call it the &quot; September scheme &quot;) is &quot;politically unattractive &quot;and does not amount &quot;on either political or social policy grounds to an&quot;effectivealternative to Crossman.&quot;The September SchemeV3. r agree with these strictures. Itis not really a graduated scheme at all.On the contrary, it perpetuates the flat-rate scheme, with only one material change the figure of 175. 6d. a week (including &quot; overload &quot;), to which we agreedthat the total contribution must be increased next year in the interim Bill, is tobe further increased by Is: every five years until it reaches 21 s. 6d. still levied as a flat rate all round without any increase in benefits. To this is added a separatescheme (with &quot; contracting out&quot;) for graduated contributions and benefits on earnings between  10 and  15, the additional contribution ranging up&quot; to&apos; 8s1. Thehew income from this scheme would be used to reinforce the flat-rate scheme until it has to be used for the new emerging cost of the graduated benefits.4. To levy a flat 17s. 6d. contribution, plus an additional graduated contributions, and apply all this income to the flat-rate scheme, would of coursemake a temporary iniprdvefrierit in its finances. But I must^agree that it wouldbe very unpopular; and it would produce anew,&apos; though postponed, emerging costof considerable dimensions.5. Nor does the scheme really provide for &quot; contracting out,&quot; if that meansfreedom for the individual to decide for himself whether to sign on for the graduated benefits or not. The Minister is doubtless right in advising that theproposals in his Appendix B represent the best terms on which contracting outcould be arranged. But let us consider their effect.6. The self-employed man cahtiot sign on: the employed cannot&apos;sign&apos;;off,unless his employer- proposes it. This the employer can do&apos; Only if his&apos;&apos;6wnrschemecomplies with certain conditions (the Mineworkers&apos; scheme,;for -example,&apos; is &quot;toosmall5 to qualify), arid of-&quot;he is; willing td!:uridergp- certain controls. If theerriployerdoes sign ofiy :allJihis ^mpToyeeSrrafe rkompuls&apos;6rily &quot; out,&quot; ihiiht&amp;itig^ny who^Want52263THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
to stay in: otherwise, all his employees are compulsorily &quot; in,&quot; including any whowant to get out. The complications and controls which all this entails, as described in the Ministers Appendix B, are indeed impressive.7. If half those who are now covered by occupational schemes prove inpractice to be &quot; out,&quot; the initial loss of income is put at  50 millions a year. (the saving in expenditure is not material for 20 years or so.) No one knows how muchcontracting out would actually happen. If it is made easy, the loss is heavy: if itis made difficult, why do it at all? But whatever the initial loss, it is bound toincrease unless of course occupational schemes cease to grow (they are growingfast at present). The Minister^ figures make no allowance for this.8. The Minister has seen representatives of the private sector the LifeOffices and the Association of Pension Funds. The Life Offices, who are unlikely to be keen on any graduated State scheme, haye nevertheless said that they wouldtolerate a scheme on the lines of the August scheme, and that they did not wantcontracting out of a scheme of that size. They also indicated that they would oppose the September scheme on account of its size, even if contracting out were allowed. If the latter scheme were reduced in size to approximately that of theformer, the Life Offices would still not want contracting out. The Association ofPension Funds also expressed no enthusiasm for contracting out in practice perhaps because it means introducing considerable State control of the private sector.9. So the new proposals would please no one. A mere continuation of the flat-rate scheme would gain us no credit either. We must therefore turn again tothe scheme we considered on August 2nd.The August Scheme10. It is important to be clear about the principles of this scheme and thenew social conception which it embodies. I have set these out in Appendix A.In Appendix B I have given my reasons for thinking that the scheme would makeit easier to defend the interim Bill.11. It seems to me that these proposals represent a new and imaginativeapproach to the problem, and are not without political attractions. Once the newprinciple is grasped see Appendix A of a basic benefit no longer entirely uniformbut nearly so, the question of contracting out does not arise, and we are spared itsinevitable complexities and frictions. We should also avoid the opposition ofthe private sector, and any new State control of it. Above the level of the graduatedbasic benefit everyone would retain their existing freedom to make further provision, through the private sector or otherwise, to any extent desired. this seems to me to be wholly in accord with Conservative principles.12. The scheme thus gives us something new on which we can stand incombating the Labour plan. The question I have to consider is whether it isfinancially sound. The figures in the Ministers Appendix C do not give a realisticpicture of its probable out-turn, largely because, as the Minister explains, theyare framed on the basis that the level of earnings between 1960 and 1980 will bestatic at the level reached early this year (before this summer&apos;s wage-round of 5 per cent.).13. It is clear that if we assume a static economy and a static social policy, a graduated scheme shows little, if any, advantage over a flat-rate scheme of roughlythe same size. But if we are to assume both economic and social progress, a graduated scheme clearly offers the better alternative. The full financial picture of the August scheme depends on the settlement of about half a dozen detailedfeatures within the scheme&apos;s broad principles. These include the treatment of married women and of short-term benefits, and a final decision on the rate of contribution. I would hope that it can be kept as low as 8 per cent, without any subsequent increases, even to meet increased benefits. In the short time available(my officials and I saw the Minister^ suggestions for the first time last week-end)I have not been able to form my own conclusion about all these details. But Iunderstand that even if they are all settled in a manner unfavourable to the scheme&apos;sfinances, it is reasonable to expect that the scheme will be in balance in its first year, while in 1966-67, by which time an increase in benefits will almost certainly be needed, a surplus should be available which would help to finance it.
Conclusion14.   I therefore recommend that the Cabinet should now (i) Take a firm decision in principle in favour of the August scheme;(ii) direct that the work of the Departments concerned should be immediatelyconcentrated on clearing up its detailed provisions;(iii) ask for the matter to be brought again before the Cabinet in, say, afortnights time.P.

APPENDIX APRINCIPLES OF THE ORIGINAL GRADUATED scheme. Thespheme recpgn^es^for^the^firgt time that the necessary basic provisionfor a manVold age varies wlth;his; financial status.during his working life. At the bottom it provides &quot;a&apos;,jpensiQQ. which for the, married man in the lowest earnings-rangers &amp;alf-pay&apos;or Better. (It is&apos;80^.-half^f  8 aJweek:)r the variation upwardsis kept within narrow limits so as not to impinge upon the proper &quot;scope of theprivate sector.2. It also recognises that the extent to which people ought to receivesupplement from the Exchequer for their basic benefit also varies with their financial circumstances. It therefore charges, for the new.&quot;graduated basic&quot;benefit, a; newgraduated contribution: for the least well-off it is smaller,,and for the most well-offit is greater, than a flat-rate contribution would have to be. The exchequer supplement is concentrated where it is most needed viz., those worst off. Lowerearners receive a considerable Exchequer supplement; higher earners receiveprogressively less; some receive none at all.3. The contribution is put at 8% on earnings up to  15, with an exchequer supplement of 2% on earnings up to  8. The yield would increase with risingearnings, but the rate should, preferably, remain constant (though a small increase may be necessary after a few years).4. If the value of money changes, increased benefits will be needed. Toprovide finance for these increases, the figures of  8 and  15 would be adjustedso as to keep their value constant in real terms. The scheme thus provides ameasure of self-financing for enhanced social benefits without any inflation of therate of contribution. Adjustments of this kind would not be offensive to theprivate sector.5. A fixed percentage of earnings to be set aside for old age, sickness and unemployment benefits (providing also a modest contribution to the cost of the health Service) represents a new principle in this country. If it is accepted thatthe real level of those benefits depends on the real yield of this percentage i.e.,on the productivity of the earning population a new political approach and anew form of social discipline become possible.APPENDIX BEFFECT OF GRADUATED SCHEME ON THE DEFENCE OF the interim bill. The fiat-rate contribution of 17.?. 6d. to be introduced next year is a heavyone. It is a measure of the difficulty of financing any social advance in this fieldthrough the flat-rate system. It is regressive in effect, bears hardly on the lower-paid, including part-time earners, and leads to complaint from employers aboutthe cost to them of employing married women or old-age pensioners part-time.Nor can we disguise the fact that it includes a considerable element of &quot; over-load.&quot;2. It will be difficult to defend, but it will be much easier if we can do so onthese lines. The Government recognise that this is not the best way of financing the increase in benefits which we all want to see i.e., an increase in real terms to a new standard. For that purpose a graduated scheme is necessary, which will put contributions on a fairer basis. Unfortunately this cannot be introduced till1960; the Government were therefore faced with the alternatives of deferring thenew standard or of financing it meanwhile on a flat-rate basis. They have chosenthe latter.3. The Government believe that this is the right course, despite the present economic difficulties. But unhappily it does mean that for the intermediate twoyears a heavy flat-rate contribution must be levied on everyone.4. But this is only temporary. The year 1960 offers the prospect of reducedcontributions from those least able to afford them indeed, from most people whoseearnings are less than the present average. There will be increased contributions from the higher-paid, but they will get an additional benefit. No one will pay ahigher contribution without also getting a higher benefit, but plenty of people will pay a lower contribution without getting a lower benefit, and some will pay a lower contribution and get a higher benefit too.
