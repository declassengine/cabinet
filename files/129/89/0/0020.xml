secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957Copy No.  57C. (57) 2204th October, 1957CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA: AGRICULTURE AND THECOLONIESNote by the Paymaster-GeneralThe attached memorandum by officials examines the implications for UnitedKingdom Colonies of the proposals in the field of agriculture set out in C. (57) 219,and suggests the attitude which should be taken in this regard by the UnitedKingdom representatives at the meeting of Ministers of member countries of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) which is to be heldin Paris from 16th to 19th October to discuss the European Free Trade Areaproject.2.  I comment on the note in my memorandum C. (57) 222.R. M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,3rd October, 1957.
EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA: MEETING OF O.E.E.C. MINISTERS-COLONIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM proposals on AGRICULTUREMemorandum by officials the present policy on the relationship between overseas territories and themoves for closer economic association in Europe was arrived at following discussionwith representatives of our Colonial territories in March and April this year.The results of that discussion were considered by the Cabinet on 6th May, 1957(C.C. (57) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.   The policy is in essence:  (a) The exclusion of overseas territories from the industrial Free Trade Area(though the Cabinet said they would be prepared to re-examine thisquestion in the light of developments at a later stage).(b) A demand for mitigation of the damage done to Colonial interests by theTreaty of Rome.The mitigation to be sought will, broadly speaking, be an appropriate alleviationof the tariffs to be charged by the Six on Colonial products coupled with non-restriction of imports of Colonial produce in implementation of the &quot; managedmarket &quot; provisions of the Treaty.3. The acceptance of this policy by Colonial Governments was not, however,uniformly enthusiastic. Apart from the special case of Hong Kong which was ready and anxious to accept the full obligations of membership of the Free trade area, several important African territories saw advantages, from the point ofview of maintaining and improving their present position in European markets,in an alternative policy of including in the Free Trade Area Convention provisionsanalogous to those in the Treaty of Rome associating the overseas territories of the six Powers.4. In implementation of the policy in paragraph 2 above we have sent amemorandum to the Six setting out the case for mitigation and have made itclear to the Six and other European countries that we see considerable difficultiesin the inclusion of overseas territories in the Free Trade Area. The FrenchGovernment have given us to understand that if we wish to take this line theywould not oppose it, though they did not consider that our territories had a case for &quot; mitigation &quot; or that we would find support from world opinion for this view.The other members of the Six have reserved their position on the grounds that the, case for exclusion or inclusion of overseas territories cannot be properly assesseduntil the shape of the proposed Free Trade Area is clearer. Some interest has been shown by other members of O.E.E.C., particularly Denmark, in the inclusion of overseas territories on the ground that it would provide access to the markets ofthe French overseas territories for their exporters.5. In coming to the view that overseas territories should be excluded, Ministers, had three considerations particularly in mind:  (a) Inclusion would compromise our position as regards the exclusion of foodstuffs from the Free Trade Area and might also affect our position on the &quot; peripherals.&quot;(b) Inclusion, which would have to be optional for each of our Colonies,would introduce a division in the Colonial Empire, those not wishing to join also having their position in the United Kingdom marketprejudiced without securing any compensating advantages in theEuropean market.(c) It would not be logical to admit to the Free Trade Area Colonies advancingto independence, but to exclude such independent commonwealth countries as might wish to join. Apart from the difficulty of negotiatinga Free Trade Area of such potentially wide extent, admission of commonwealth countries would mean a serious erosion of the imperial preference enjoyed by our exporters in independent Commonwealthmarkets.
6. The new proposals for agriculture may well seem to some Colonies to weaken the force of our previous arguments on (a) and. therefore, lead to a revival of their interest in association as a means of protecting their exports of foodstuffs to European markets. We cannot at this stage say whether O.E.E.C. countries will accept our latest proposals, but even if they do the establishment of institutionsfor agriculture would not in itself help our Colonial Governments to by-pass thenew preferences created against them by the Six and to that extent there wouldbe no immediate necessity for any Colonies to seek association. It should berecognised, however, that the institutions envisaged might possibly be devolped in a way which would provide Colonial Governments with an opportunity todevelop discussions about the position of Colonial products in European markets and of maintaining and improving their position there. On the other hand, the considerations at (b) and (c) are as valid now as they were in April and (c) is becoming more of a live issue in that New Zealand is showing interest in beingassociated with economic integration in Europe.7. On balance, therefore, we recommend that for the present we should maintain our position:  (a) that the Agreement for Agriculture, like the Free Trade Area, should be confined to Europe; and(b) that we should continue to press for mitigation of the effects of the Treatyof Rome.8. Circumstances may, however, be substantially affected in the next two to three months, particularly by what happens to our proposals on agriculture inO.E.E.C. and to our efforts to obtain mitigation.9. No final judgment on the possibility of adequate mitigation will bepossible, however, until the reaction of the world to the overseas territories clauses of the Treaty of Rome has been shown at the forthcoming Session of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.). We should, of course, continue topress strongly for mitigation in those discussions. Furthermore we recommendthat, if the course of discussions in the G.A.T.T. makes it necessary, political pressure should also be brought to bear on the Six, using the arguments set outin our memorandum on mitigation.10. If by both these approaches mitigation cannot be achieved, or notachieved to a satisfactory extent, new measures will be necessary if we are not to fail in our responsibilities to the Colonies. What new measures would be appropriate might, however, depend on developments in the meantime in thediscussions on agriculture in O.E.E.C. We cannot at this time foresee what thosedevelopments will be but it is important in the meantime not to take a position that would exclude tropical foodstuffs from the scope of the Agreement on agriculture (paragraph 17 of the separate submission on agriculture is relevant inthis context).Recommendations11.   We recommend:  (1) for the purposes of the O.E.E.C. meeting we should maintain our position regarding the exclusion of dependent overseas territories from the free trade Area and the agricultural arrangements (paragraph 7);(2) that we should continue to press for mitigation of the effects of the Treatyof Rome on our dependent overseas territories both in the G.A.T.T.and, if necessary, in other ways (paragraphs 7 and 9);(3) that the position should be reviewed in two to three months&apos; time in thelight of developments (paragraph 10).
