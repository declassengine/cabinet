(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(57) 21019th September, 1957CABINETRECENT EVENTS IN GHANAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations in view of the public interest aroused, my colleagues may liketo have the story up to the present.2. On 30th July, the Ghana Government made deportation ordersagainst two members of a Moslem opposition party in Kumasi (Ashanti)and against the (African) deputy editor of the Accra &quot;Daily Graphicasubsidiary of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.   It was generally understood that theGovernment wished to deport the first two because of anti-Governmentactivities in Ashanti, and the third for constant Press criticism of theGovernment.3. The two Moslems, who had been born in Kumasi, contested the deportation orders on the ground that they were Ghana citizens and there-fore not liable to deportation; the deputy editor of the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;,who was born in Sierra Leone, obeyed the order against him.   Thesedeportations, and particularly that of the newspaper man, gave rise toPress criticism in various countries, and to a protest by the Common-wealth Press Union;  Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s reply was that the freedom of thePress in Ghana &quot;is not endangered in any way&quot;.4.        The Ashanti Divisional Court met in due course in Kumasi(where considerable tension was reported to exist) to consider the Moslemsappeal against the deportation orders against them.   AfterMr. Geoffrey Bing, Q.C. , arguing for the Ghana Government, had given  an assurance that they would not be actually deported pending an investi-gation of their claims to citizenship, the (British) Judge discharged an injunction previously granted against the deportation orders, and the two men were brought down to Accra and placed in custody in prison.   ten days later, amid hostile demonstrations, the Ghana Government putrapidly through the Ghana National Assembly a special Bill enabling theMinister of the Interior to deport the two men from Ghana, without appeal;and they were immediately deported to Nigeria.   The reasons given byDr. Nkrumah in the Ghana Parliament for this action were inter alia thatviolence had taken place in Kumasi during the first Court hearings, thatthe good faith of the Judge had been impugned and that the situation wouldhave to be dealt with by other methods.COPY NO.
5.        Meanwhile, Mr. Ian Colvin of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, who hadbeen in Kumasi covering the Court proceedings for his paper, hadincluded in his report which appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on13th August the following paragraph -&quot; &apos;British judgment bad1, shouted one toga-clad Moslemto me, tapping his face to signify a blind eye in mr. Justice Smith.   &apos;Give us back our Gold Coast.   down with Ghana1 shouted another. &quot;6.        The Ghana Government (who are evidently most resentful of critical comment that has appeared in the United Kingdom Press -ranging from the &quot;Tribune&quot; to &quot;The Times&quot; - about the deportations)warned Mr. Colvin on 19th August that he was not to leave Ghana, andnext day applied for a writ of attachment against him, charging him withcontempt of court.   Similar writs were issued against the editors of an opposition paper in Kumasi, the &quot;Ashanti Pioneer&quot;.7.        On 10th September, the contempt of court proceedings opened inAccra.   Mr. Christopher Shawcross, Q.C. appeared for Mr. Colvin,as well as for the &quot;Ashanti Pioneer&quot;, and Mr. Geoffrey Bing, who had just been appointed Attorney-General to the Government of Ghana, forthe Crown.   On 12th September, the Court accepted Mr. Shawcross&apos;scontention that, as the proceedings in respect of which the allegedcontempt was committed took place in the Divisional Court at Kumasi,the Accra Court had no jurisdiction.   Mr. Shawcross also obtained an award of 2 50 guineas costs for Mr. Colvin.   On 14th September Mr. Colvinand the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; filed writs in Accra claiming damagesapparently for &quot;unlawful detention, unlawful conspiracy, malignantprosecution and slander&quot;, from Mr. Bing, the Minister of Justice, the(British) Chief of Police and also Dr. Nkrumah .8.       After the failure of the Governments proceedings in Accraagainst Mr. Colvin, Mr. Shawcross flew to Nigeria to see the two Moslemdeportees.   Mr. Colvin was warned that further proceedings were contemplated against him and that he would be apprehended if he tried to leave the country.   He was shortly afterwards served with summonsesto appear in the Kumasi Court on Friday, 20th September to answer a charge (under Section 394 of the Ghana Criminal Code) that he hadpublished his report &quot;with intent to excite popular prejudice&quot; against theauthorities responsible for the first deportation orders.   After thesummonses had been served, the (European) Chief of Police told mr.. Colvin that he could go to Nigeria on an assurance being given thathe would return to Ghana on Tuesday, 17th September.   This assurance was given and he was permitted leave.9.        Up till this stage, the United Kingdom High Commissioner inAccra, Sir Ian Maclennan, had, on my instructions, refrained fromintervening in the matter.   So far as we were aware, the GhanaGovernment were acting within their legal rights and none of the parties had requested help from United Kingdom Government agencies.   But on16th September, it was reported in the Press that Mr. Krobo Edusei, theGhana Minister of the Interior, had given orders, &quot;in order to maintainpeace and stability in the country&quot;, that Mr. Shawcross was not to be permitted to re-enter Ghana.   I thereupon instructed the HighCommissioner to express concern to the Ghana Government and to askfor the facts of the matter and for any views about it that they mightlike to make known to us.   The Press was also informed of these instructions.
10.      Before receiving these instructions, Sir Ian Maclennan saw the Acting Prime Minister of Ghana on the afternoon of 1 6th September(Dr. Nkrumah has been away on holidy for the last week or two) .Mr. Botsio spoke with considerable feeling about the attitude of theUnited Kingdom Press and of B.B.C. comment, and was clearly muchincensed by Mr. Shawcross&apos;s attempt to bring Dr. Nkrumah into thematter by seeking a writ against him.   He also handed the HighCommissioner a formal note which pointed out that, in the view of theGhana Government, a condition attaching to the privilege that UnitedKingdom lawyers might be admitted to practise in Ghana was that theyshould not attempt to make use of the Courts of Ghana for attacks uponthe integrity of Ministers and the propriety of laws passed by the GhanaParliament.   (I attach, at Annex A and B, copies of this note and of a reply to it which I have instructed the High Commissioner to deliver.)The High Commissioner has commented to us that Mr. Shawcross hadoverplayed his hand and turned the case into a political affair and thatthe position was exacerbated by seeking damages from Dr. Nkrumahpersonally; this action, according to Sir Ian Maclennan, was likely torally support to the Ghana Government and to give colour to their belief that it was the &quot;Daily Telegraph&apos;s&quot; settled policy to denigrate anewly independent Commonwealth country.11.       It has also been reported that writs against Dr. Nkrumah andother Ghana authorities, similar to those issued in Ghana, have been applied for in London on behalf of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and ofMr. Colvin.   The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; have instructed Mr. Colvin notto return to Ghana until further orders, despite his undertaking toreturn to Accra by 17th September; they are now bringing him to london for consultations.   It is understood that Mr. Shawcorss has informed the Bar Council that when he returns to this country he intends to submit a report on Mr. Bing with a view to their instituting an enquiry intoalleged action by him in perverting the course of justice in Ghana  andin deceiving the Court in Kumasi.   Mr. Shawcross has also cabled to theCommonwealth Parliamentary Union urging Ghana members to reverse the decision of their Government and even going so far as to solicitsupport from Nigerian Parliamentarians.   And finally Mr. Shawcrossproposes publicly to test Ghana&apos;s ban upon him by making an attempt to regain admission to-day.1Z.      We have certainly not heard the last of this affair.   The GhanaGovernment are clearly much offended at the actions of Mr. Shawcrossand at the attitude of the United Kingdom Press and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;in particular.   They have acted badly in shutting out Mr. Shawcross.Increasing misgivings about the way things are going in Ghana are beingexpressed in this country.   On the other hand Mr. Shawcross, justifiablyoutraged by the behaviour of Mr. Bing, seems to have conducted his case with a strong political flavour, and to have been most unwise, politicallyspeaking, to serve a writ on Dr. Nkrumah who was absent for most ofthe relevant period.   Moreover, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&apos;s&quot; application fora writ in London, if granted and not withdrawn, will presumably make itimpossible for Dr. Nkrumah to pass through London on his way to theUnitedNations shortly without being involved in legal proceedings.13.      I shall be reporting to Cabinet as the case develops.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.18th September, 1957
ANNEX a text OF NOTE OF 16TH SEPTEMBERFROM THE GOVERNMENT OF GHANAHer Majesty&apos;s Government in Ghana wish to make clear toHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom the conditions uponwhich citizens of the United Kingdom who are not citizens of Ghana are permitted to practise law in Ghana.It was the practice when the Gold Coast was a Colony of theUnited Kingdom for members of the English, Irish and Scottish Barsand for solicitors from the United Kingdom to be admitted to practisein Ghana despite the fact that the members of the Ghana Bar who arealso members of the Bar in the United Kingdom are not permitted to practise as barristers in other parts of Africa under British control.The Government of Ghana hope that it will be possible tocontinue the practice by which persons who are not Ghanaian citizenscan be admitted on a visitor&apos;s permit in order that they may appear inthe Courts of Ghana.It is, however, naturally a condition of this privilege that anyparson to whom it is accorded will behave with due respect to theGovernment and the constituted authorities of Ghana.   It would be destruc-tive of the good and close relations which at present exist between theUnited Kingdom and Ghana if United Kingdom citizens came from Britainand attempted to make use of the courts of Ghana for attacks upon the integrity of Ministers and the propriety of laws passed by the Parliamentof Ghana.The Government of Ghana avails itself of the opportunity ofrenewing the assurances of its highest esteem.ANNEX BTEXT OF REPLY WHICH THE UNITED kingdom high COMMISSIONER IN ACCRA HAS been instructed TO DELIVERHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom wish to thankHer Majesty&apos;s Government in Ghana for their note of 16th September aboutthe admission of citizens of the United Kingdom who s.re not citizens of ghana to practise law in Ghana.2.        The United Kingdom Government have not commented and have no desire to comment on any matter which is the domestic concern of anindependent Government.   However as the Government of Ghana in thefourth paragraph of their  note have expressed the view that the Courts of ghana should not be used for attacks upon the integrity of Ministers andthe propriety of laws passed by the Parliament of Ghana, the UnitedKingdom Government feel obliged to comment that the usual course is forthe Courts themselves to take any action which they deem appropriate to
prevent any lawyer from using their facilities in a manner which theyconsider to be improper.   In these circumstances the United KingdomGovernment must express their regret that the Ghana Government shouldhave deemed it necessary by administrative action to prevent an UnitedKingdom lawyer who has already been admitted to practice in the GhanaBar from returning to Ghana to continue the defence, on which he was already engaged, of an United Kingdom citizen accused before the GhanaCourts.3.        The United Kingdom Government share the hope of the GhanaGovernment that it will be possible to continue the facilities under whichlawyers from the United Kingdom are admitted to practise in Ghana.They warmly reciprocate the desire of the Ghana Government that thegood and close relations which exist between the two countries shall be fully maintained.
