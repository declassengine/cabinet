WAGES POLICY;  THE PUBLIC SECTORMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour and National service to safeguard the currency we must not allow wage increases in the aggregate to absorb the total increase in production without taking countervailing action.   Without such action prices will rise andthe value of the currency will fall.   There should, however, be no attemptto secure a wage freeze or to prevent the operation of the establishedprocesses of free collective bargaining and arbitration.   A general wagefreeze cannot be secured for the Government has no means of controllingwage movements over the greater part of the field of employment.   nor can we hope to effect a wage freeze even in the State service if wage rates outside were moving upwards.   There is no alternative to thesystem of collective bargaining and arbitration except some form of central wage fixing and the country is clearly not prepared to accept that.2. While the Government cannot by direct action bring wageinflation to a complete halt over the whole field, there are three ways inwhich it might seek to slow down wage inflation:(i)       its general economic policy;(ii)      bringing home the facts to the public, e. g. , throughthe Cohen Committee;(iii)      its own action as an employer and its indirect influenceupon the nationalised industries.3. The remainder of this paper deals only with the third point.Unless we are successful in dealing with the cases which come withinthe direct control and influence of the Government and so set an example,we can have no hope of success for our policies over the remainder of the field.4. The governing principles of our policy in regard toGovernment service employees should be -(a) We should slow down the pace of wage increases.(b) Any wage increases secured by settlement or arbitrationmust be balanced as far as possible by compensatingsavings, except in so far as they are matched by increased productivity.   Inflation must not be fed with further finance.-1-(7909)   Wt. 38549/D.1291   SOm   8/57   P.I.

(c) There should be no wage freeze, no attempt to prevent theoperation of the established processes of free collective bargaining and arbitration.5. The Government must therefore neither appear to be leadingin the wage race nor to have abandoned the idea of doing justice to itsown employees, including its indirect employees, e.g. in the national health Service.   It must not appear to interfere in the determination ofwages in the nationalised industries, although it is entitled confidentiallyto make its views and policies plain to the chairmen of these bodies.   Itmust not interfere or even appear to interfere in the negotiations in other fields of wage settlement.IThe Civil service. We can handle pay claims for the Civil Service consistently with our two principles of not preventing the operation of free collective bargaining and arbitration and of offsetting any increase with compensatingsavings.   We must honour our obligation to fix pay on the basis of faircomparisons with comparable outside employment but in construing themwe must aim to pitch our offers at the lowest possible point knowing thatin perhaps the majority of cases this may lead to arbitration and that thearbitrators award may give a higher increase than could have been settled by negotiation.   A fuller account of claims in progress and how they should be dealt with is in the Appendix.   Three points should be madehere.7. First the wages increases already given this year, togetherwith those which we estimate will be awarded before its close, will cost 32 millions this financial year (of which  18 millions is for the PostOffice).   The corresponding costs next year will be  50 millions and 24 millions.   The extent to which these increases can be balanced bycompensating savings will only be apparent when Departments havereplied to the Prime Ministers minute of 10th August calling for savings,in expenditure.8. Secondly, industrial wage claims in the Civil Service willhave to be handled in accordance with our obligations under the fair wages resolution.   There can be no question of pitching our offers low.   We are obliged to apply the rates negotiated nationally by the general body ofemployers.9. Thirdly, the Cabinet should take account of the currentclaims by the Post Office engineers.   The Postmaster-General has beenasked to restrict his offers to figures lying well down in the range indicated by fair comparisons in the knowledge that this may result in arbitration.The claims will be settled one way or the other in about three weeks.The total cost will be large, up to about  4 millions, and the amountsawarded to certain classes may be as much as 20s. a week.   In justifyingthe award we shall have t* say not only that it fulfils our undertaking to honour arbitration awards, but that the cost of the increases to put the engineers on the same footing as the rest of the Fost Office and the restof the Civil Service was allowed for in the increased charges announced by the Postmaster-General this summer.-2-TOP SECRET
IINational Health Service10. The application of this general policy to the National health service should present no difficulty at any rate for some time exceptin the case of the clerical and administrative staff.   Any further claims from the big battalions - nurses and doctors - will not fall to be dealtwith till at any rate next year.   Claims for a few minor groups - cost about  200,000 - are of no great significance.11. The difficulty about the clerical/administrative claim   was before the Cabinet last week (C.C.(57) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 4).   TheMinister of Health told the Management Side that their offer should notbe more than 5 per cent to the grades above  1,200 who had had no pay increase since February 195^ and that no offer should be made for thosebelow this limit whc got 3 per cent in December/January last.   He had also warned them that he would not necessarily implement a higher offer,if made and accepted.   The Management Side persisted in offering 3 percent to the latter group and it was accepted.12. Two further facts should now be brought out -(a) The negotiated increases are not operative until theMinister has approved their application.   This powernot to implement agreed decisions has not been used by Ministers since the Health Service was set up.(b) Since there is no dispute between the two sides, thestaff, almost certainly, cannot go to arbitration, butthe Minister could agree exceptionally to an arbitrationreference on an issue between himself and the staff.   in doing so, he would be establishing a precedent which couldbe quoted against him, e.g. by the doctors.13. There seem to be four alternative policies -(a) The first would be to stand firm.   The Regulations providefor the Minister to give approval to rates agreed in negotiation.   Thisis no ritual gesture.   Ministers should exercise their powers and thecountry will see that the Government mean business.   The objections are that whatever we say, the Unions&apos; propaganda will be that, despitedeclarations by Ministers that established processes of free collective bargaining and arbitration will be maintained, the Government in theirown interests have sabotaged the Whitley machinery,(b) The second policy would be to defer the implementation ofthe settlement for some months.   The objections here are that the Unionswill not be propitiated and will still say there has been interference in the established wage machinery, and that this amounts to a wage freeze.(c) A third course is to authorise the increases.   They may notattract much notice and may be considered an inevitable consequenceof the recent wage increases to local government staff.   The minister would tell the Management Side that he was shocked that they had giventhese increases against his wishes, that he was taking steps to reviewhis powers of exercising a controlling voice on the Management Side-3-TOP SECRET
and in the meantime he had only approved the increases to honour theGovernments declared intention of doing nothing to prevent the operationof established wage machinery.   If the settlement attracted publiccomment, he could say the same publicly.   This might answer anycriticisms though it might still be represented that the Government hadtaken no steps to stop a wage increase in its own sector.(d)      The fourth course is a variation of the first.   The Ministerwculd disallow the increase but would offer to go to arbitration and to stand by the arbitrators1 award, though he would make it clear that thecost of any award would have to be offset by retrenchment in the national health Service.   This would remove some of the onus from theGovernment.14. All these alternatives involve some difficulties.   The health ministers in their paper (C,(57) 238) may have a better solution.   Subjectto that, our feeling at present is that the fourth alternative is the leastunsatisfactory.15. We understand that the Health Ministers will shortly be putting in a further paper setting out the present constitution of theManagement Side and recent efforts to improve their control over it.It seems to us vital to take immediate steps to secure real control andto prevent a recurrence of the present incident.   It also seems vital that, if and when an increase is authorised, we should say that as faras practicable this is going to be offset by compensating savings.IllOther public Services16. There are no immediate practical problems in the other public services, schools, police, fire services, probation officers, etc. since there should be no claims this financial year.The constitution of the Whitley bodies should be looked at at once to prevent the embarrassment caused by the semblance of ministerial control which in substance is non-existent.17. There is an immediate problem in respect of the new towns staff.   The Whitley constitution here is even more unsatisfactorythan that of the National Health Service.   The Ministers representativeis not allowed to vote.   The decision of the Council can be implementedwithout any power of intervention by the Minister who, however, financesthe salary bill from Votes.   The staff are virtually identical in originand affinities withthe National Health Service staff and have a goodclaim for comparable treatment.   We suggest that the Minister of housing ought immediately to get into touch with the Chairman of theManagement Side to make quite certain that they will adopt government policy  and will not follow one of their own.-4-
iv the Nationalised Industries18.     Precautionary measures have already been taken in the field of nationalised industry.    In response to a request from the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Ministers of Power and Transport have informed the chairmen of the nationalised industries (Central Electricity Authority,National Coal Board, Gas Council, British Transport Commission andthe Airways Corporations)that no concessions in pay should be made without reference to Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and this has apparently been accepted by all concerned.19.    That takes care of the situation for the time being.    We must clearly do what we can to get our general principles accepted in thissphere.    Policy will vary from case to case and will have to be considered at the time.    In principle it will be desirable to push opposition to wage claims to the point of arbitration, for which there is machinery inside these industries.    It would, of course, be understood that arbitration awardswould have to be honoured.    The consequence however in some casesmay well be strikes.20.    There is no reason to fear that the management sides will not co-operate to the best of their ability.     The chairmen have stressed thatapproaches to them should be personal and confidential.    Legal advicetaken on a previous occasion seemed to suggest that it would be possiblefor the appropriate Minister to issue directions to the nationalised bodiesto refuse wage increases:  but the position is far from clear and it wouldbe essential to ask the Law Officers to confirm this view before any suchaction could be contemplated in any specific case.    In view of the co-operative attitude of the chairmen above, this point has not been furtherpursued at present.21.    The only cases likely to come to a head in the next few months arethose of the railwaymen and the London busmen,    A special factor inrelation to the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) is that the railways are even now dependent on Government loans for meeting current losses.The objective is to make it plain to the B.T.C. that no additional Exchequerfunds will be made available to meet increased wages and, insofar as these increases are not immediately offset by increased productivity, retrench-ment would be the inevitable consequence.    The practicability of thiscourse is being urgently examined.Summary of Conclusions22.    Our conclusions, which can only be set out very broadly, and mustbe read in conjunction with the rest of this paper are:-(a)       Our policy in the public sector should be to slow down the pace of wage increases and to offset by compensatingsavings any that are secured.    At the same time weshould maintain established processes of collective bargaining and arbitration and there should be nowage freeze.-5-
(b) Civil Service claims should be handled in accordance withthese principles.(c) Cur provisional view is that the least unsatisfactorysettlement of the National Health Service problem isfor the Minister to refuse to implement the settlementbut to offer arbitration.(d) The Minister of Health, we suggest, should at once gripthe potential difficulties in the New Towns pay claim.(e) In the nationalised industries generally we should aim at securing our objectives by the co-operation of the chairmen.    In the case of B.T.C. the objective is toensure that additional Exchequer funds are not madeavailable to meet any increased wages that may beobtained.P.T.I.M.18th October, 1957.APPENDIXClaims under negotiations and pending in the Civil Service(outside the Post Office Engineering Union Group)1.    Cases going to arbitrationGradePrison OfficersAssistants (Scientific)Cartographic Draughtsmen2.   CleanersA report from the Fay Research Unit is available and this is nowbeing examined by the Official Side and the Staff Associations concerned.We do not expect that the facts produced by the Unit will show that thereis very much owing to the cleaners, so that our minimum offer may wellbe nil.    An increase of 2d. an hour, for Fost Office cleaners as well asthe others, would cost  400,000 a year.3.   MessengersA report from the Pay Research Unit on messengers is likely tobe available soon, and we expect this to show that something is owing tothe grade.    An increase of 10s. per week would cost about  250,000 a year.-6-Date of Arbitration    Possible AnnualCostOctober, 1957  200,000October, 1957  200,000October, 1957  300,000
4.   TelephonistsA report from the Pay Research Unit is expected fairly soon.    Itwill cover not only Post Office telephonists but also the comparatively small group employed in other Departments.    We have literally no ideawhat the report is likely to reveal.    An increase of 10s. a week in the pay of telephonists would cost  1 million a year.5.   Radio OperatorsRevaluation negotiations are in progress for this grade, and the pay Research Unit are investigating the Post Office group.    A settlementmight well cost  300,000 a year.6.   Typists and Machine OperatorsThe typists and machine operators were given a fair comparisonaward by the Priestley Commission.    They have nevertheless pressed for investigations by the Pay Research Unit, and a report may well beavailable before the end of the year.    If the Priestley Commission put their pay in line with the outside world, the report should point to a niloffer.    An increase of 10s. a week would cost about  1,300,000 a year.7.   Clerical OfficersA report by the Pay Research Unit on clerical officers is likelyto be available by next March, and this may well point not only to scaleshortening, but also to a small increase at the maximum of the scale,costing in total possibly  4 millions.8.   IndustrialsAny further adjustment in, for example, engineering wages will be reflected in pay improvements at Government industrial establishments.The &quot;M&quot; rate is now due to be brought into line with pay movements since 1st April, 1957.    The increase is likely to be 6s. per week, which will cost 1,870,000 a year.-7-:TOP SECRET
