(57) 23818th October, 1957CABINETWAGES POLICY: NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of HealthThere appear, to be five possible courses for dealing with the Whitleyagreement to give a 3 per cent, increase to officers on salaries up to  1,200 perannum:  -A. To approve the agreement.B. To withhold approval without right of arbitration.C. To offer to submit the question to arbitration on the basis that we would accept the award but without making additional money available topay for it.D. To offer arbitration on the normal understanding that any extra money required would be forthcoming.E. To withhold approval but to announce that approval would be given atsome future date to be determined in the light of circumstances and toundertake to review the question in six months&apos; time.2.   Course AOn the individual merits of this claim there is a-good deal to be said for thiscourse; but we would not press it if our colleagues. consider that its implications for current economic policy are clearly unacceptable..;Course B 11This would mean that the staff were condemned without the benefit ofarbitration enjoyed by much larger and more powerful bodies. It would be saidthat they) suffered disadvantageous treatment, not because their case was weakerthan others, but because it was so strong that no dispute had arisen to provokearbitration. It would also be said, with less justification but with equal certaintyand force, that the Government were willing to apply to the small black-coatedworker methods which they were afraid to apply to the large and powerfulindustrial Unions. We do not therefore consider Course B defensible.Course CWe appreciate that this course may be attractive and appropriate where thecost can be absorbed in economies without real detriment to the service. This isnot however the case with the National Health Service.  While it may be that in52420
the long term economies are possible, it is, in view of the Guillebaud Report,impossible to identify any now, and equally impossible to assume the existence ofunspecified opportunities of economising. The alternative of cutting staff is equallyimpracticable because this would involve a reduction of the service, e.g., the closure of hospital beds.If therefore Course C were followed, hospital authorities, long subject to asharper curb of economy than that applied elsewhere, might be expected either toreduce services (e.g., by closing hospital wards), or to overspend, or to resign. Wetherefore consider Course C inappropriate in this case and fraught with dangerand detriment to the National Health Service.Course DThis has much to commend it.  It is, however, open to two objections :&quot;-4$&amp;\(i) It would almost certainly lead to an immediate wage increase and consequent public expenditure, with repercussions in other cases;(ii) it might provide an embarrassing precedent in respect of the doctors and dentists, following the Report of the Royal Commission on their remuneration.Course EThis would have as advantages:  (i) It would avoid any embarrassing precedent during the particularlysensitive period of the transport negotiations;(ii) it would enable this claim to be dealt with in the light of the result ofthe transport negotiations and other relevant circumstances;(iii) it would not involve the intractable difficulties involved in Courses Band C.3. If Course A must be ruled out, we favour Course E, but would regardCourse D as less unacceptable than Courses B and C.4. We propose that that part of the agreement which gives a 5 per cent,increase to officers on salaries over  1,200 should be approved at once, theChancellor of the Exchequer having agreed it in advance.5. The situation we are considering throws into relief the weakness of thepresent Health Service negotiating machinery. Though the structure is illogicaland unsatisfactory, it would be unrealistic to think in terms of a dramatic changeovernight. These factors must be borne in mind:  (i) The system has continued for nine years;(ii) to change it might well require legislation;(iii) as recently as last year, the Government revised the position in the opposite direction the table in the appendix to this memorandumsets out the position;(iv) the position of a considerable number of interests in the health and hospital world is involved.Nevertheless, if our colleagues agree, we propose immediately to explore, inthe light of the above factors, possible methods of establishing an improved, morelogical structure,, and to submit a further memorandum as soon as we have done so.J.
