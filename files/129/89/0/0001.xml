THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1957CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (57) 20110th September, 1957CABINETDUTY-FREE ENTRY PROVISIONS IN NEW TARIFF legislation memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn my memorandum on the proposed comprehensive tariff Bill (E.A. (57) 81),I undertook to circulate during September a paper on the question whether or notthe Bill should re-enact the substance of the mandatory provisions in the present law for the exemption from duty of Commonwealth goods. (For convenience Irefer to these provisions below as the &quot; statutory bar.&quot;). 2. I have so far deliberately refrained from asking my colleagues to consider this issue, since I thought it desirable that we should reach a conclusion in thelight of all the most recent developments affecting trade relations with theCommonwealth. It is now however a matter of urgency that we should give the draftsman instructions on this matter if the Bill is to be ready for introduction atthe opening of the new Session in November.3. Whatever decision we may reach may give rise to controversy inParliament. It is clear to me, however, that in this country at least, there will bemore controversy if we continue a statutory bar than if we drop it.4. In the annex to this paper I have tried to set out as objectively as possiblethe main arguments for and against the retention of any statutory bar in the new legislation. The essential point is that the 1932 legislation imposed a general charge on all imports, and goods subject to this charge were not shown in the tariff. since there was no comprehensive list of duties, it was not possible to show in the tariffthat duties would not be charged on Commonwealth goods. With this type of tariff structure, there was no alternative to some form of statutory bar. The tariffto be introduced under the Bill will list all goods with separate columns showingthe duty position for foreign and Commonwealth imports; and a statutory bar will thus be superfluous.5. My own view is that, in relation to the independent Commonwealth atleast, we should certainly not re-enact the statutory bar in any form. We should,however, make it clear in advance to Commonwealth Governments andsubsequently to Parliament that it is not the intention to make any change in theduty-free treatment of Commonwealth goods as a result of the dropping of thesemandatory provisions. The structure of our legislation affects neither our policynor our commitments.6.   My reasons for reaching the conclusion in the foregoing paragraph are :  (a) it is quite unnecessary (and indeed inappropriate) to tie our hands in domestic law to carry out the duty-free obligation to commonwealth countries for which over a substantial field of goods our agreements with independent Commonwealth countries still provide;(b) the fact that we have mandatory provisions of this kind in our lawinevitably means that Commonwealth Governments put less value on duty-free entry guarantees to them in our existing agreements or in securing any such guarantees in any future negotiations. our negotiating position is thus seriously weakened;52228
(c) our present duty-free entry commitments to independent commonwealth countries vary and have been modified from time to time. We have,for example, no contractual duty-free entry obligation to Pakistan, andwe are now committed to accord free entry to Australia only for goodsin which Australia has an acjj^e trade interest. To,include in the bill provision which covered &amp;se&amp; variety and changing emphasis of these commitments would be misleading and largely meaningless and couldonly be in the form of a requirement that duties should not be charged on Commonwealth goods when agreements currently in force precludedthem.7. I recognise that the position of the dependent colonies is rather differentsince the United Kingdom stand in a different relationship with those territories,and so long as they remain dependent there would presumably be no question of formal trade agreement negotiations with them. In practice, however (since weshould obviously not discriminate against the colonies in favour of the independent commonwealth) the colonies enjoy the benefit of our duty-free entry commitments to independent Commonwealth countries, in so far as the commodities which thecolonies produce are covered by these commitments. While a statutory bar for thecolonies would be possible, it would mean reaching a decision on the treatment of colonies which become independent. This problem, while not insuperable,illustrates the difficulty of making any general statutory provision of this kind fora heterogeneous and developing group of territories.8. Finally, I would expect the confirmation in new tariff legislation of mandatory duty-free entry rights for any part of the Commonwealth to be morecontroversial than its omission from a tariff structure in which (unlike the present structure) it is demonstrably unnecessary. I feel, therefore, that even in relation,to the colonies we should not include any form of statutory bar in the new Bill.In that event we shall, of course, have to make it quite clear to Parliament that nochange in our existing policy is involved.9. I invite my colleagues to agree that the draft Bill should not includemandatory provisions for the duty-free entry of Commonwealth (includingcolonial) goods.D. E.Board of Trade, Horse Guards Avenue,London, S.W. 1,10th September, 1957.
annex summary OF ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST MAINTAINING A&quot;STATUTORY BAR&quot; IN NEW TARIFF LEGISLATIONArguments for Maintaining a &quot; Statutory Bar &quot;1. We shall in general want to present the Bill as a recasting incomprehensive and simplified form of existing tariff legislation which does not materially affect the duties which are in practice imposed or the policies whichdetermine their variation. To drop the &quot; statutory bar &quot; would appear to be inconsistent with this general approach and might give rise to disproportionatecontroversy.2. In view of the prospective Free Trade Area negotiations Commonwealth(including colonial) Governments might be suspicious of any legislative change inthe United Kingdom which appeared to prejudice access to the United kingdom market.3. The colonies cannot negotiate trade agreements with the United Kingdomand (notwithstanding any undertakings given to them about this matter) theywould be bound to feel that they would be losing a real safeguard if the statutecontained no continued- guarantee of duty-free entry.4. Although we have always in the past resisted pressures from domesticindustry for the imposition of duties on Commonwealth goods on the grounds that this would be contrary to our policy and have not made much play with the argument that we do not have the necessary powers in our legislation, it would obviously be more difficult to resist domestic pressures in the future if we had dropped the statutory prohibition.Arguments against Maintaining a &quot; Statutory Bar &quot;1. With a tariff written in Brussels Nomenclature form there will no longer be any technical need as there was in 1932 to make provision in the Bill thatduties are not to be charged on Commonwealth goods. This will be covered inthe new tariff by writing &quot; nil &quot; in the Commonwealth column against each headingwhere Commonwealth goods are now duty-free.2. Existing legislation already recognises the principle that certain dutiesmay be charged on the goods of the independent Commonwealth. Moreover,some protective duties (e.g., the silk and McKenna duties) are already charged,mostly at preferential rates, on all Commonwealth (including colonial) goods. The&quot; statutory bar &quot; is therefore not an absolute but a qualified prohibition and wouldbe quite inappropriate in a Bill which is designed to provide a common structurefor all protective duties, including those to which the &quot; statutory bar &quot; does notapply at present.3. Independent Commonwealth countries have safeguarded their position asregards duty-free entry to the United Kingdom in their trade agreements with theUnited Kingdom. It is illogical and undesirable to give statutory force to such agreements which automatically limit our freedom to impose duties on commonwealth goods. Whilst the colonies do not enjoy these contractual rights,they do afford some protection to the colonies since it would be inconceivablethat we should discriminate against them in favour of any independent commonwealth country; though this point is valid only to the extent that the commodities which the colonies produce may be covered by our commitments to independent Commonwealth countries, whereas the present &quot; statutory bar &quot; isunqualified in its application to the colonies (unlike its application to theindependent Commonwealth).4. The combination of our obligations under the G.A.T.T. not to increasepreferences and of the existing statutory provision that duties shall not be imposed on Commonwealth goods in effect places a ceiling on a very large part, of ourprotective tariff (including goods in which the Commonwealth has no active tradeinterest). If we had no statutory provisions dealing with duty-free entry we wouldhave freedom to adjust, where necessary, those tariffs on which we have no specificcommitments to foreign countries and where there is no active commonwealth trade interest.
