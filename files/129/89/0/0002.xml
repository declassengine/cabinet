?(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (57)20211th September, 1957CABINETPROPOSED I, B. R. D.  LOAN PGR the nuclear POWER PgjOGRAMMEMemorandum by the Minister of power the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum(C.(57)199)  confirms me in my belief that we would he illadvised to pursue the possibilities of a loan for ournuclear power programme from the International Bank on thelines surges ted.20      The Chancellor&apos;s recent discussion with the President ofthe Bank makes it clear that no loan would be forthcomingunless we were prepared to invite market participation fromWall Street.    I think the Economic Policy Committee wereright in the view they took last July that there should be noparticipation by Wall Street (E.A.(57)23rd Meeting, Item 2).3o      The President of the Bank seems to have made it clear tothe Chancellor that it is our nuclear power programme, andthat programme alone, that the Bank would &quot;be interested tohelp finance.    This confirms my view that for various reasons the United States would like to get their fingers in ournuclear programme and that we should resist such overturesas being unwelcome to the people of this country.k*      The President of the Bank however,  though he &quot;made it plain that he contemplated a continuing programme of dollarfinance&quot;, seems not to have committed himself in any way which might give us confidence that really significant sumswould be made available towards financing our programme.In any case I understand that there would be no chance ofobtaining a Bank loan towards financing the first power stations in our programme and no advantage to us could therefore accrue during the next two years though we should start incurring unpopularity as soon as it became known thatwe were seeking aid from the Bank and Wall Street.5o      I am all for encouraging investment in our industriesfrom outside the sterling area where such investment wouldprovide not only finance but business prestige, know-how(technical and marketing)  and access to export markets whereforeign currency could be earned.    The Esso Oil Company is agood example of the advantage to us of such investment.But the proposed loan to our nuclear programme would bringus no such advantage, and it would involve us in a continuingcommitment to repay dollars for many years to come.M.Ministry of Power, S.W.1.COPY NO.11th September, 1957.
