In C.(57) 195 I proposed that we rhould aim at keeping the levelof public investment within a total of  1,500 millions in each of the years1958/59 and 1959/60, and calculated that that would require a cut ofabout 10 per cent or  320 millions off the programmes shown in the annex to that paper.   Annex A shows the revised figures for investment in those two years which have either been agreed or proposed fordiscussion with Departments.   The Minister of Transport has not feltthat any reduction should be made   in the expenditure on roads planned for those two years, nor does he think it wise to reduce the investment of the airways corporations, but he has accepted an adjustment of 20 millions in each year in the programme for the British transport commission; the Minister of Power has undertaken a reduction of up to 76 millions over the two years in the programme for the fuel and powerindustries; and the Minister of Housing has agreed to accept a cut in thepublic housing rate of from 120,000 to 100,000 houses in England andWales by 1959/60.3.       These and other smaller cuts to be demanded elsewhere alreadyproduce a total in striking distance of the target mentioned inC.(57) 195.   But on present form the required total of adjustment wouldnot be secured in 1958/59 and perhaps not in 1959/ 60.   In addition,some of the proposals recorded in the provisional score sheet may not prove in the event fully achievable.   In order to be sure of hitting the target, further adjustments of at least  20 millions over the two years would be necessary.   Some contribution towards these may be obtainedfrom the programmes still to be discussed with Departments and fromprogrammes such as water and sewerage, in respect of which no savinghas been assumed so far, but it may be necessary in the event for ministers to consider the possibility of further savings in major sectors.Reductions in the housing programmes show the quickest returns, but still further to reduce the housing figures will raise some seriousissues.
4.       Control of the supply of money to the private sector would havefar reaching results and is of crucial importance.   The Government areat present armed with no effective powers for this purpose and are dependent upon the co-operation of the banks.   I have asked them tohold their advances during the next year at the average level for thelast twelve months.   It may well be however that the measures thatthe banks are able to take will not prove sufficient and I must warn mycolleagues that it may be necessary to seek statutory powers to ensureadequate control of credit.   The management of the credit base is ofcourse already the subject of enquiry by Lord Radcliffe&apos;s Committee.But the present situation is too urgent to allow us to await its report and we must consider now what further steps should be taken, if need be.   For this purpose I have asked the Economic Secretary to preside over a small working group from the Treasury and Bank of Englandwho should call in such expert advice from outside as may be necessary.No publicity will be given to these discussions.Building Control5.       The severity of the cuts proposed in the public housing programmeraises the question whether it would nfet be politically embarrassing topermit private investment to continue in the miscellaneous sectioncovering other than housing and industrial development, for examplegarages and petrel stations,   it was however the general view when we discussed it in our group that there would be even greater objectionamongst the Governments supporters to the re-imposition of aphysical control of which they were glad to see the end.   A licensing system, if statutory authority were given for it, would anyhow be slow to operate and if it were effectively to bite upon the type of development which I have in mind would inevitably be pretty complex.   It should in anycase not be necessary if we can really gain centrol of the supply ofmoney in the private sector.   For these reasons we have concluded thatsuch a control need not be instituted, at any rate at this stage.Hire-purchase6.       For much the same reason we have concluded that furtherrestriction on hire-purchase credit would not really be worth while.The objections against any further variation in the hire-purchase termshave been set out by the President of the Board of Trade in C.(57) 203.Further restriction would be superfluous if a really effective restriction of credit were secured at the source by a reduction of bank advances,and if we failed, to secure this it is doubtful whether additional hire-purchase restrictions would do much to stem the tide.Presentation7.       We have agreed upon a draft Press statement in the terms at annex B.   It is for consideration whether I should issue this on my ownbehalf or whether it should go out as a Government statement.
8.       I should propose to see the financial Press in a series ofinterviews on Wednesday, 18th September prior to the issue of thestatement on 19th September.   The President of the Board of Tradeand I are also proposing to give advance information to the Federationof British Industries of the terms of the statement.   The Minister ofLabour will take similar action with the British Employers1Confederation and the Trades Union Congress.   The Minister of power will see the Chairmen of the nationalised industries.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.16th September, 1^57

ANNEX draft STATEMENT1.     The Government are determined to maintain the internal and external value of the pound.2.      The readjustment last month of the exchange rate for the Frenchfranc generated a wave of speculation among the world&apos;s leadingcurrencies, in which sterling has been heavily involved.   I wishcategorically to emphasise the determination of the Government tomaintain the existing exchange rate parity of $2. 80 to the pound.   Theyconsider that this parity is right, and that the evidence of the UnitedKingdom balance of payments and trading figures support this view.They have no intention of changing this parity either by moving to anew fixed point, or by allowing the margins to widen.3.      The internal and external value of our money cannot be sustainedunless we as a nation pursue the right policies at home.   It will not bepossible to check the rising cost of living and maintain the worth of sterling if we try to spend more or live better than our resources allow.Steps have been taken and are being taken to limit current civil and defence expenditure.   But a limitation of the Governments current expenditure is not enough.4.      I said in the House of Commons on 25th July that &quot;it may wellbe necessary to re-phase some programmes&quot; in the field of public investment and that the Government would &quot;not hesitate to make thenecessary adjustments&quot;.   The Government have accordingly decided upon certain further steps in relation to both public and privatespending.   Their object is to ensure that the supply of money and the pressure of demand do not exceed the man-power and resources whichare in fact available.5.      In the first place, the Government propose to hold down the totalof investment in the public sector which would otherwise have risensubstantially during the next two years within the level attained thisyear.   This includes the sum of investment by Government Departments,by local authorities and by nationalised industries.   Particulars of the adjustments which will be necessary for this purpose will be given whenFarliament resumes its sittings in October.6.     Similar restrictions are necessary in the private sector.   TheGovernment are determined to control the supply of money in this sector and are prepared to take for this purpose any necessary measures or any additional powers that may be needed.7.     Meanwhile they propose that the average level of bank advancesduring the next twelve months should be held at the average level forthe last twelve months.   I have informed the bankers of this requirement.8.     There can be no remedy for inflation and the steadily rising prices which go with it which does not include, and indeed is notfounded upon, a control of the money supply.   So long as it is generally believed that the Government are prepared to see the necessary financeproduced to match the upward spiral of costs, inflation will continue and prices will go up.
9.     /f he Government recognise that these measures will bedistasteful, and not least to the Government; but they are necessary.7/These measures are necessary.7 They will mean that programmes of development in both the public and private sectors will take longer to fulfil.   Nevertheless the actions are in the Governments judgmentinevitable if we are to halt the rise in the cost of living and defend thevalue of our money.   They will be pressed to such lengths as may prove necessary to achieve these ends.
