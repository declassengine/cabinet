I comment on the note in my memorandum C. (57) 222.R. M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,3rd October, 1957.52333
EXAMINATION OF THE  TREATY OF  ROME  IN  THE  GENERALAGREEMENT   ON   TARIFFS   AND   trade memorandum by officials the Twelfth Annual Session of the Contracting Parties to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) starts in Geneva on 17th October,and may be expected to last for six weeks or two months. While there will bemuch other business, the major topic of the session will be the examination of theTreaty of Rome in the light of the relevant provisions of the General Agreement.The Contracting Parties will be meeting at Ministerial level for a few daysbeginning on 28th October; the President of the Board of Trade will then representthe United Kingdom. It is unlikely that there will be substantive detailed examination of the Treaty of Rome until after the Ministerial meeting.2. We shall be meeting representatives of the other Commonwealth countriesin London for a few days beginning on 10th October to discuss the handling ofthe Treaty of Rome at the session and other matters on the sessional agenda.3. The General Agreement gives Contracting Parties the right to depart fromthe principle of most-favoured-nation treatment on which it is based in order toform customs unions or free trade areas, provided their proposals satisfy certaintests laid down in the Agreement. The task of the Contracting Parties at the session is to determine if the proposals of the Six Powers satisfy these tests. Sincethe G.A.T.T. is a treaty signed by the Contracting Parties defining rights and obligations, much of the argument will concern the precise interpretation to begiven to. its provisions.4. In terms of the G.A.T.T. examination, the proposals of the Treaty of rome fall into two parts :  (i) the proposal for the creation of a customs union (and economic union)of the Six, and(ii) the proposal for the creation of what the Six claim to be a free trade area,consistent with G.A.T.T., comprising the Six as constituting an eventual customs union and the overseas territories.5.   The main questions to be considered in the G.A.T.T. will be:  (a) Do the proposals of the Six for a free trade area embracing themselves andthe overseas territories satisfy the G.A.T.T. tests for a free trade area?(b) Is what the Six aim to achieve as between themselves a customs unionas defined in Article XXIV of the G.A.T.T. (the Article dealing with theformation of customs unions and free trade areas)?(c) Have the Six an adequate plan and schedule for achieving this within areasonable time?^ Under both (b) and (c) the special provisions for agriculture in theTreaty of Rome will require special examination.(d) Are the proposals of the Six for the common tariff compatible with the tests in Article XXIV of the G.A.T.T.?6. Treaty of Rome provisions for the association of overseas territories withthe Six. For us, a major question arising on the Treaty is whether the ContractingParties can accept the claim of the Six that what is aimed at is a free trade areaconsistent with G.A.T.T. The Six will argue this strongly, but they are open to challenge particularly because of the opening the Treaty leaves for introduction of tariffs (and possibly other restrictions) to protect developing industries in the overseas territories against exports from the Six. If the Contracting Partiesmaintain that the arrangements cannot be regarded as satisfying the tests for a free trade area, but are, in effect, an extension of a preferential system, they wouldrequire a special waiver (by two-thirds majority) under Article XXV; and it could then be the objective to ensure that the Contracting Parties withheld the grant ofthe waiver until the Six had made concessions to mitigate the damage threatened to third countries including our own Colonies. Our Delegation should try to securethat it is agreed that the arrangements can be made compatible with the G.A.T.T.only by a special waiver on conditions such as those outlined above.
7. Customs Union of the Six. On this, our direct interests are more limited.On the assumption that we negotiate a free trade area, it is the other members of..the Commonwealth, and other outside countries, who have the major concern inthe common tariff, and it is likewise these who have the major interest inthe agricultural provisions, though parts of the common tariff are of concern to ourColonies and these might also be affected by the agricultural provisions. other commonwealth countries, however, will look to us for support in pressing their interests, and we shall need, throughout the session, to work in close collaboration with them and other countries sharing their interests.: 8. Plan and Schedule. In Paris we and others have criticised the plan and schedule of the Treaty of Rome for the elimination of internal tariffs and other restrictions in three stages on a number of grounds, of which the most important is the provision for the transition from the first to the second stage to be delayed.We propose that our Delegation should repeat the criticisms made in Paris, withthe objective of securing that, if there were any delay in the smooth progress ofthe gradual abolition of internal tariffs and other restrictions, the ContractingParties to the G.A.T.T. would have an opportunity to review the reasons for thedelay.9. Agriculture. The provisions about agriculture in the Treaty of Rome arein general terms and the details remain to be worked out. Though it is for thecountries which export agricultural produce to take the lead in criticising these provisions, our Delegation should try to secure arrangements whereby the detailed arrangements affecting agriculture, when they are elaborated, will be subject to review by the Contracting Parties.10. Common Tariff. As regards the common tariff, the test laid down in theG.A.T.T. is, in general terms, that the duties should not on the whole be higherthan the general incidence of the duties applicable in the member-countries beforethe formation of the customs union. Its terms thus leave the Six considerableflexibility in the common tariff rates fixed for individual products, and outsidecontracting parties, with an interest in particular common tariff rates, may haveto rely upon the negotiations which individual members of the Six will eventuallyhave to undertake for the modification of their G.A.T.T. bindings where these arebelow the level of the proposed common tariff. There is also, however, the point that over an important range of products (amounting to about 20 per cent, of the external trade of the Six) the duties eventually to be levied against the outside-world have still to be negotiated between the Six. These include a number of rawmaterials and semi-finished products where the eventual level of the common tariffbears closely upon the problem of defining origin in the free trade areanegotiations in Paris. Our Delegation should, if they can muster enough support from other countries outside the customs union, try as far as possible to securethat all the duties are made known before the G.A.T.T. countries pronouncethemselves as satisfied that the common tariff proposals of the Six conform withthe tests of the G.A.T.T.11. From a number of points of view it is in our interest that the ContractingParties- to the G.A.T.T. should move slowly rather than quickly in pronouncingupon the compatibility of the Treaty of Rome with the G.A.T.T. Our ability topress certain points in the Paris negotiations might be prejudiced if the ContractingParties completed their examination of the Treaty of Rome too quickly. Whetherthe examination of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Rome can be completed at the forthcoming session or whether it would need to be continued early nextyear cannot at this stage be foreseen with any certainty. If the Contracting Partiesdecide that the Colonial arrangements require a waiver under Article XXV, detailed negotiations for mitigation would almost certainly extend beyond the forthcoming session. We could not seek to lay down in advance a time-table for the examination of the Treaty of Rome. But as the work of the session proceeds,opportunities for arguing for delay may present themselves; and, while it wouldbe politically undesirable for our Delegation at Geneva to have as their objectivethe prolongation of the discussions in the G.A.T.T., our Delegation could, withoutappearing to be obstructive, take advantage of these opportunities.Recommendation12. It is recommended that, in the talks with the Commonwealth which weshall be having before the G.A.T.T. session, we should aim to secure support fora policy on the lines set out in this paper, and that, subject to any points which mayemerge from the Commonwealth talks, these objectives should guide our delegation at the session.
