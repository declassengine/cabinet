Sentences in square bracketsrefer to proposals which have not yet received final policy approval.2.      I must draw the attention of my colleagues to the implications ofthis draft in terms of the legislative programme.    As the Home Secretaryindicated in his memorandum C.(57) 132 of 30th May about the 1957-58session, the time likely to be available for legislation will be about fifty-five days.    This allocation of time must cater not only for the Bills fore-shadowed in The Queen&apos;s Speech but also for the other Bills known to be essential (i. e. , those Bills in List A of the Annex to C. (57) 132 which arenot mentioned in the Speech), for certain of the contingent Bills indicatedin List A J of the Annex to C. (57) 132,and perhaps for additional Bills of major policy such as the Betting and Gaming Bill and, possibly, a Billon Administrative Tribunals deriving from the report of the franks committee.3.      The Bills foreshadowed in the draft Speech are liable to absorbpractically the whole of the fifty-five days.    The Cabinet should realise,therefore, that the total programme which we contemplate is still over-loaded;  and, before the text of the Speech can be finally settled, we must seek to decide, as rapidly as possible:-(a) Whether we propose to introduce an Agricultural HoldingsBill as well as a Slaughterhouses Bill, or are content to rest on only one of these.    (The draft Speech at themoment includes both.)(b) Whether we intend to commit ourselves to introducing legislation to replace emergency powers in relation toland by permanent statutory provisions.(c) Whether the pensions legislation next session is to be confined (as the draft Speech provides at the moment)to a relatively simple Bill to increa.se benefits and contributions under the National Insurance scheme oris to comprise also a more comprehensive reform of the whole pensions system.-1-TOP SECRET
(d) Whether we intend to introduce a Betting and Gaming Bill.(The Home Secretary has circulated a memorandum onthis subject - C.(57) 206).(e) Whether we propose to introduce legislation about child welfare and adoption.(f) Whether we wish to introduce legislation to implementany of the Franks Committee &apos;s recommendations inthe next session or whether, as the Home Secretarysuggested in C.(57) 132, the Bill for this purpose should stand over until 1958-59.K.House of Lords, S.
