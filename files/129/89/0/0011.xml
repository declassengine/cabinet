secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957C. (57) 211 Copy No.11th October, 1957CABINETOLD-AGE PENSIONSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI was instructed by the Cabinet on 19th September (C.C. (57) 70th Conclusions,Minute 1) to prepare a statement setting out the various proposals for further government action in relation to pensions and the arguments for and against each.1.The Existing Flat-Rate Scheme2. By way of preface, and for purposes of comparison, it may be useful to summarise the essential features of the existing fiat-rate scheme.3. In each year the cost of benefits to existing beneficiaries (retirement and windows&apos; pensions, sickness and unemployment benefit, &amp;c.) is met in the firstinstance from contributions in respect of existing contributors. Since the numberof pensioners is rising steeply, there is at any given level of benefits an inevitablerise in the Fund&apos;s expenditure with no corresponding increase in the Fund&apos;s income.There is in fact no fixed relation between the Fund&apos;s annual income andexpenditure. If there is a surplus (and there has been one every year up to now),it is not paid into the Exchequer but is retained in the Fund and invested inGovernment securities. When the deficit emerges, as it will in 1958-59, it has tobe met from Votes this is called the Exchequer deficit or by realising securitiesnow held in the National Insurance Fund, a process which on any substantial scalewould be inflationary.4. Compulsory contributions are made to the Fund by employers andemployed, self-employed and non-employed persons, and for each of these classesby the Exchequer. The Exchequer contribution, which is borne on Votes, is called the Exchequer supplement. The amount of the total contribution is fixed by anactuarial calculation, but is not nearly as much as would actuarially sustain thebenefits, because they are paid in full even though no sufficient charge is or can bemade for &quot; back service &quot; due to late entry and periodic rises in the benefit rate.5. Benefits have throughout been related, but not in any precise fashion, tothe concept of subsistence, although that concept is capable of progressivemodification as standards of living generally improve. The forthcoming increasein pensions to 50s. (single) and 80s. (married) will set the level in real terms higherthan at any previous time.6. An important feature of the scheme is the &quot; contributory principle,&quot; i.e., thebenefits are payable only to those who have contributed to a prescribed extent, andare then payable as of right.7. Another important feature is that an increase in benefits is alwaysaccompanied by an increase in contributions. This imposes a measure of socialdiscipline. The fact that the contribution does not represent an insurance contribution in the true sense is well understood by informed opinion, but theactuarial calculations by which it is supported have an important presentationaladvantage.
II.New Proposals : The Three Main Possibilities8. The three main sets of proposals which have been put forward for further government action are identified in this paper as (a) The June plan.(b) The September and May plans (the September plan being a developmentof the May plan designed to help to meet the problem of theExchequer deficit).(c) The August plan.The essential features of each of these plans are summarised in the following paragraphs.The June Plan9. (a) This plan is based on the following principles: -(i) The National Insurance Scheme on its present flat-rate basis, butat the new higher levels, would continue to be regarded as theright extent of compulsory provision at the present time.(ii) Beyond that the development of supplementary pension provision would be left to the voluntary processes of industrial bargainingand personal thrift; but the Government would create anindependent statutory Corporation, which would act on acommercial basis as an insuring agency with a &quot; commoncarrier &quot; liability in order to facilitate supplementary provisionfor groups of employees which have not yet been reachedeffectively by the private sector (e.g., persons employed in small businesses and in casual, migratory or part-time employment).(iii) Those who insured with the Corporation would have their pension rights preserved on change of employment. This might help toencourage employers to provide the same facility in their ownoccupational schemes.(b) The public exposition of this plan could also draw attention to the existing powers conferred on the Minister of Pensions by Section 27 of theNational Insurance Act, 1946, to approve and to enforce againstrecalcitrant employers or workers pension schemes negotiated in anyindustrial group by the two sides of industry.(c) This plan could, but need not be, associated with a provision bringingprivate pension schemes under the same measure of financialsupervision as at present applies to insurance companies.The May and September Plans10.   The essential features of the May plan sire:  (a) A statutory obligation would be laid upon employers to make a minimumsupplementary pension provision for their employees in respect of a specified amount of earnings above the level for which the basic flat-rateState pension would be regarded as sufficient provision.(b) This obligation could be discharged by an employer either by contributionthrough an occupational scheme which satisfied certain prescribedminimum requirements or by contribution to an independent State-sponsored Corporation (the &quot; back-stop &quot;) which would be responsiblefor, the management and investment of its own funds and the paymentof its own benefits.(c) The employer, in the discharge of his minimum obligation, would have a statutory right to recover up to a specified proportion of the minimumcontribution from the employee.11.   The essential features of the September plan are:  (a) It would preserve the concept of the May plan of the statutory obligation on the employer and his right to discharge it by making satisfactoryprovision for the employee through the private sector.
(b) In order, however, to meet the emerging financial deficit in the national insurance Fund, it would substitute the State and the national insurance Fund (i.e., State supplementary insurance) for the State-sponsored independent Corporation of the May plan but would preserve the right of the employer to discharge his obligation through an approved occupational pension scheme.(c) Subject to this right of contracting out, it would provide for the levy,over and above the flat-rate levy for the basic scheme, of contributions of 4 per cent, a side from employers and employees in respect of earnings between  10 to  15 per week ( 8 to  13 for women). Therewould be no Exchequer supplement to these contributions.(d) Additional pensions above the standard National Insurance rate would be payable in respect of these graded contributions on a strictly actuarialbasis which would give no more and no less than value for moneywithout weighting in favour of older entrants. Illustrative figuresshowing rates of contribution and benefits (including the flat-rate contributions and benefits) are given in Appendix A.(e) For contracting out, occupational schemes would have to satisfy certain conditions, viz.,(i) Contributions and benefits at least equivalent to those under theState supplementary insurance.(ii) Preservation of these equivalent pension rights on change ofemployment by their members (transferability).(iii) Solvency.(/) Self-employed persons would not be eligible to participate in the Statesupplementary insurance.(g) The surplus of income from graded contributions over gradually maturingliabilities for supplementary pensions would provide relief to theExchequer against emerging deficits on the basic flat-rate scheme. Thisincome would rise automatically with earnings, whether due to inflationor increased national wealth, but would diminish to the extent thatapproved occupational schemes developed. Further relief might beprovided by provision to increase the basic flat-rate contribution by 6d.a side at intervals of, say, five years.The August Plan12.   The essential features of this plan are:  (a) It would supersede the flat-rate basis of the present National InsuranceScheme.(b) Employers and employees would be required to contribute 4 per cent, eachin respect of all earnings up to  15 a week for men (or a lower figure for women). Self-employed persons might be required to contributeeither a flat rate or 6-V per cent, of earnings. There would be aminimum rate of contributions for all, including non-employed persons.(c) The Exchequer would contribute at a rate of 2 per cent, of all earnings up to  8 a week (Or a lower figure for women).(d) The basic pension benefit would no longer be at a flat rate.   It wouldbe at a standard rate of 50s. (80s. married), but this standard wouldbe increased within restricted limits by graduated benefits related tocontributions in respect of earnings over  8 a week. Illustrative tablesgiving rates of contribution in respect of employed workers and ratesof benefit are given in Appendix B. The figures of benefits in thatAppendix include a measure of weighting of pensions in favour of older entrants to the scheme.(e) The income of the scheme would rise automatically with increasedearnings, whether due to inflation or increased national wealth.Provision might be made to increase the rate of percentagecontributions by i per cent, a side at intervals of five years.(f) The Exchequer contribution would be wholly devoted to the standard rateof benefit, and would in effect be made available to subsidise thebenefits of contributors in inverse ratio to the level of their earnings.
(g) It would be for decision whether graduated benefits would be provided for sickness and unemployment, on a basis similar to graduated pensions.(h) There would be no provision for contracting out on the part of thoseparticipating in occupational pension schemes.General comment13. The three plans summarised above reflect different approaches to theproblem. The June plan is limited to encouraging voluntary action though its adoption need not prejudge the possibility of further compulsory action at a later stage. The other plans adopt the concept of compulsion to ensure that additionalpension provision is made for those higher-paid workers who can reasonably beexpected to contribute towards pensions higher than the standard set by the flat-rate scheme. The September and May plans approach the problem on the basis thatthis provision should supplement a continuing flat-rate pension, which would stillbe regarded as the basic provision; they leave employers to choose whether thissupplementary provision should be made through the private sector or the State.The August plan adopts a different approach, whereby the basic provision would be financed by full graduation of contributions and would itself include a limited degreeof graduation of pensions above the minimum flat rate. Under this plan the wholeof the compulsory provision would be made through the State.IllGeneral Policy Considerations14. Ministers may find it convenient to consider first the following general questions of policy:(a) Should the area of Slate compulsion be extended, on grounds of social policy, to provide pensions for higher-paid workers at a higher level than under the existing fiat-rate scheme? If so, how far should suchcompulsory extension go?The May, September and August plans would extend the area of compulsion: the June plan would not. It has been argued on the onehand that some compulsory extension of the present statutory obligationis desirable as a measure of social reform. On the other hand it has beenargued that extended compulsory saving may not be generally popular.(b) Should the financial structure of the basic State scheme be changed?The August plan would wholly remodel the basic scheme.The September plan would leave it unchanged, but would reinforce the finances of the basic scheme by appropriating for that purpose thesurplus of income from the new graded contributions over the graduallymaturing liabilities for supplementary pensions.Neither the May plan nor the June plan would make any difference to the finances of the present fiat-rate scheme.(c) What are the inflationary implications of extended compulsory savings?The June plan would have no such implications.The inflationary implications of the September and August planswould be determined by the immediate changes they would make in contributions at the time of their introduction (in 1960-61), by which time the inflationary effects of next Session&apos;s increase in fiat-rate contributions will already have been fully worked out.As regards employees&apos; contributions, the reduction of contributions for lower-paid workers under the August plan might be obscured, fromthe point of view of wage claims, and attention might rather be focussedon the additional contributions required under either scheme in respectof higher-paid workers. These additional contributions would be greater under the September plan than under the August plan, but theeffect in the former case would be mitigated through the use made ofthe provision for &quot; contracting out.&quot; Thus, the effect of the two schemes on wage claims might not be widely different.
As regards employers&apos; contributions, the August plan would leavethe total more or less unchanged at the outset. Under the Septemberplan they would be increased by the additional graduated contributions in respect of higher-paid workers. From this point of view, therefore,the September plan would be more inflationary than the August plan,through its effects on the costs of production of those firms orundertakings which had not previously contributed to occupational schemes on the full scale which would in future be required.(d) What impact would State action have on existing and future occupational schemes? And what effect would the different plans have on the nature and extent of State responsibility in the field of pensions (and other benefits)?The June plan would have little effect.The effects of the September and August plans are discussed inparagraphs 21-24 below, where the conflicting opinions are set out.IVComparison of the Three Main PlansThe June Plan15. This plan, if adopted, would be put forward in opposition to theCrossman plan rather than in competition with it.Ministers will wish to consider whether it goes far enough to meet the politicaldemand for improved pension provision.They will also note that it would do nothing of itself to relieve the finances of the existing scheme by providing an expanding source of revenue although itwould not prejudice other methods of dealing with the financial problem if theywere thought socially and politically desirable.On a lower plane, it must be noted that the role of the State corporation would present difficulties. Its administration costs might be higher than those ofthe Life Offices because, unlike theirs, its clientele would consist largely of casualor migratory workers or workers in small undertakings. This difficulty might be mitigated or removed by administrative assistance from the State machine (e.g.,the advice of the Government Actuary and the record keeping and other facilities of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance). The question whether theinvestments of the Corporation Fund should be confined to gilt-edged securitieswould also pose problems.16.   On the other hand the plan has the following advantages:  (a) It  would  avoid  the  inflationary  impact  of  additional  compulsorycontributions.(b) By recognising that supplementary pension provision is really part of&quot; wages and conditions of employment&quot; it would place firmly on theTrade Unions the responsibility for negotiating for improvements insupplementation as part of the improvement of the conditions of their members.(c) It would limit the sphere of State responsibility in social security to basicneeds and would avoid any possibility of State responsibility for making good any fall in the real value of supplementary benefits.(d) Psychologically, it would encourage rather than discourage personal responsibility and providence as against reliance on the State.(e) It is the only scheme which cannot be represented as a miniature version of the Labour Party&apos;s plan.(/) It would present the least administrative problems,(g) It could be launched (i.e., the Corporation could be set up) more easilyand more quickly than any of the other schemes.(/?) It could be put forward as a constructive contribution at this juncture,but not necessarily as a. final solution, and would thus afford time and opportunity for the testing of opinion and demand.A Variant of the June Plan17. A variant of the June plan has been envisaged involving departure fromthe voluntary principle of that plan to the extent of taking power to imposecompulsion on a body of employers where the majority of their workers, having
failed to negotiate a scheme of which they were prepared to pay half the contribution involved, applied for this to be done.This may be thought to represent a slightly more positive approach to theproblem which retains some, though not all, of the advantages of the June plan.It would impose its own difficulties, particularly in connection with the identificationof the groups of workers and majorities concerned. It might be held also to constitute a direct interference with the freedom of industrial negotiation.The August and September Plans18. If the June plan should be considered insufficient to meet the socialrequirements, and the May plan insufficient to meet the financial requirements,the choice may rest between the August and September plans.Timing19. Neither of these plans could be introduced before 1960. For the more complicated September plan delay beyond that date might be desirable.Financial aspects20. Both plans are designed to provide substantial assistance towards the prospective problems of the Exchequer. The relative advantage from this point ofview of one plan rather than the other would depend on a number of variablefactors. These include (i) the extent to which productivity and real incomes will rise in future years; (ii) the extent of &quot; contracting out&quot; under the September planboth at the outset and subsequently; (iii) whether or not pre-arranged quinquennialincreases in contributions are in fact provided for under either plan; and(iv) whether or not graduation of sickness and unemployment benefits is included as a feature of the August plan. In view of the variety of possible assumptionswhich could be made concerning these points, it is not possible to produce tablesshowing with any degree of precision the financial out-turn to be expected underthe two plans, especially after the earliest years.It can however be said that the August plan, which is designed to bring in atthe outset not much more contribution income than the forthcoming 175. 6d.flat rate, would on reasonable assumptions about the continuing growth of productivity and real earnings provide an automatic and progressive growth of income. The aim of the plan is to keep the finances in balance year by year. given  an expanding economy, it should be possible to get reasonably near to this objectivefor many years to come.The September plan would provide an immediate substantial increase in income, through additional graduated contributions. The size of this increase would depend on the extent of &quot; contracting out,&quot; but it would probably put theFund initially into surplus. With any growth thereafter in the size and numberof approved occupational schemes, the initial increase in income would be reduced;but, given increasing productivity, the per capita yield of the graduated contributions in respect of those remaining in the State scheme would automaticallygrow. The total increase in income resulting from increasing productivity wouldbe smaller than under the August scheme, because fewer people would be payinggraduated contributions, and because these contributions would be charged on anarrower band of earnings. Nevertheless, the income from graduated contributions under the September plan should initially extinguish, and for a longtime thereafter substantially diminish, the emerging Exchequer deficit under the flat-rate scheme.The September Plan21. Those who prefer the September plan adduce the following arguments insupport of it:  (a) It represents a constructive piece of social reform based on the concept thatthe duty to make reasonable provision for occupational pensions, to supplement the basic flat-rate pension, should rest primarily on the employer and not the State and that the time has come to make this duty a statutory obligation.(b) It is designed however to preserve as far as possible an important role forthe private sector in the development of occupational pension schemes.
(c) It does this, not only by providing that the statutory obligation may be discharged through the private sector, but by laying down conditions(for contracting out) designed to promote the development of occupational pension schemes along lines which are more in accord with modern needs. &quot; Transferability/&apos; or preservation of pension rights on change of employment, is desirable in the interests of greatermobility of labour; and some supervision of privately administeredschemes from the point of view of solvency is desirable for theprotection of members. Development by the private sector along theselines is the only way in the long run of preserving for it a major role inpension provision and avoiding wholesale encroachment in this field bythe State.(d) Although the necessity for these adaptations will seem difficult ortroublesome to the private sector, criticism from that quarter on that account need not be politically embarrassing to the Government.Ministers will not wish to appear to have produced a scheme to thespecifications of the life insurance companies. Moreover, these difficulties could probably be eased, and the desirable developmentsbetter encouraged, by allowing a delay of two or three years betweenthe promulgation of the statutory obligation and the bringing of thescheme into operation.(e) The plan recognises that supplementary pensions for a large number and variety of mobile or casual workers, employees of small employers, &amp;c,cannot readily be provided by private insurance, and it provides a Statefacility to meet their needs.(/) The plan, by providing that the graded contributions to the State shouldaccrue to the National Insurance Fund (out of which the benefits would ultimately be payable), creates an immediate source of income for thatFund which should initially extinguish the Exchequer deficit and for along time thereafter substantially reduce the deficits foreseen under theexisting scheme.(g) The plan bases itself on the flat-rate benefits and contributions as they willbe after February 1958 recognising inter alia the very great political difficulty of defending these contributions if the new scheme forecastany reduction of the minimum contributions by employees.(h) The plan limits the risks inherent in any extension of the role of theNational Insurance Fund beyond flat-rate benefit at near-subsistencelevel. This is the present concept of basic benefit and it connotes thefullest degree of State responsibility, carrying with&apos; it the concepts of universal compulsory contributions, supplemented by Exchequercontributions and supported by State guarantees, explicit or implicit, tomeet the emerging deficits and to maintain the purchasing power of thebenefits. The plan limits the risk by preserving a clear distinctionbetween the basic fiat-rate benefits and the graded pensions for whichthe Fund would be responsible, thus reaffirming unequivocally theprinciple that the fullest measure of State responsibility is confined to basic flat-rate requirements and that State insurance beyond that is tobe confined to supplementary pensions on strictly commercial linesgiving no more and no less than value for graded contributions.22.   The principal objections raised against this plan are stated as follows:  (a) There are serious disadvantages in so large an extension of the scope of compulsory provision. It would be inflationary: representatives of the life Offices have indicated that they would be opposed to it: and itmight not be popular either with employers or with workers.(b) It renders necessary a provision for &quot; contracting out,&quot; which requires an -elaborate apparatus for controlling occupational schemes. There are many thousands of these. Virtually none of them would at presentsatisfy the conditions laid down, and the employers concerned would be reluctant to make them do so. Unless therefore they were willing topay in full under both their occupational scheme and the enlarged state scheme, thousands of employers, public and private, would have todecide either to adapt their scheme so as to satisfy the conditions for contracting out or to cut their scheme back so as to make room forthe State scheme and render contracting out unnecessary. Much friction
would be caused, and occupational schemes (present and future) mightwell be stunted. The problems for the schemes in the public servicesand nationalised industries particularly the statutory ones would be specially awkward. The contracting-out provision gives no freedom of choice to the individual employee, and it would not remove theopposition to the plan which must be expected from the private sector.The August Plan23. Those who favour the August plan adduce the following arguments insupport of it: (a) This plan starts from the proposition that the present flat-rate scheme is unsatisfactory, not merely because it supports a standard of benefit which is under constant political pressure, but because of the high leveland regressive effect of the flat-rate contribution and the inevitabilityof heavy Exchequer deficits difficulties which are intensified everytime it becomes necessary to increase benefits.(b) Its aim is to find means of combining social progress with financialsoundness by providing a structure which would support, moresatisfactorily than the present one, new and higher standards of universal provision.(c) The key to the plan is the introduction of a graduated contribution.  Thiswould fall more equitably on employees than a flat-rate contribution,and would obviate the complaints which some employers make aboutthe undue cost of employing part-time workers. It would also ensurethat, as earnings and productivity rose, the Fund&apos;s income would be automatically increased. It would therefore make an attempt to bringthe Fund&apos;s income and expenditure into balance by providing at the outset no more income than was required, and in future years a growth of income to set against the inevitable growth of expenditure.(d) It would also provide a measure of self-financing towards the cost of further increases in benefits.(e) The plan recognises that requirements in old age vary according to the pensioners financial circumstances during work, and therefore providesfor a small amount of graduation in the basic old age benefit. But itkeeps this graduation within narrow limits, so as not to encroach undulyon the private sector.(f) Representatives of the private sector have indicated that they would notbe opposed to a scheme on these lines. There would be no room in auniversal scheme of this kind for &quot; contracting out,&quot; just as there is noroom for &quot; contracting out &quot; in the present universal scheme.(g) The plan would set no new problems for occupational schemes.  It would leave them undisturbed, without any new compulsion or control.(h) The graduated contribution means inevitably that some would pay moreand some less than the flat rate. But all those who paid more would get an additional benefit, and a graduated contribution would reduce the impact of contributions on wage claims.(z) An Exchequer supplement would remain; but, instead of being spreadevenly over all contributors, it would be concentrated where it is most needed on supporting the benefits of the lowest paid. The better offthe contributor, the less the support he would get from the Exchequer.(j) The plan maintains the contributory principle: it does not maintain theactuarial connection between the rate of benefit and the rate of contribution. It substitutes for this the concept that by government decision a fixed percentage of current earnings, up to a prescribed level,is devoted year by year to the needs of the retired. The money availablefor these social benefits would therefore be related to the level of thenation&apos;s productivity i.e., in crude terms, to what the country as awhole could afford.24. The principal objections urged against the August scheme are stated asfollows:  (a) By providing for substantial increases in contribution by the higher-paidworker, without provision for contracting-out, it would at once threatenprivate occupational schemes. Many firms already operating or about to establish such schemes would drop them, employers and workers
being unwilling to pay both private contribution and national insurance contribution on this scale. State action would thusextensively displace private insurance.(b) It abandons the well-defined and established safeguard that the universalState scheme (carrying State subsidies and implicit guarantees against inflation) is confined to benefits at a uniform flat rate near subsistencelevel. It thus opens up the way, under inevitable political pressures,to unlimited enlargement of State responsibility for wage related benefits, with consequent enlargement of public concepts of the dutiesof the State, which would be highly inflationary, and with consequentelimination of private occupational insurance, which, because of theabsence of contracting-out, would have had neither the chance northe compulsion to adapt itself for survival.(c) The loading of the scheme against higher-paid workers would strike them as inequitable and thus aggrieve an influential section of workers.(d) The scheme does not recognise the very great political difficulty of proceeding with the forthcoming increase in the flat-rate national insurance contribution for two or three years if it is to be reducedsubstantially for lower-paid workers at the end of that period.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th October, 1957.
