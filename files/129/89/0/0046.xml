202SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNCILLORSON THE INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Lord Privy seal in the Prime Minister&apos;s absence I circulate herewith, for theinformation of my colleagues, copies of the report of the Committee ofPrivy Councillors on the Interception of Communications, which is to be presented to Parliament and published on 31st October.2.      The Committee were appointed &quot;to consider and report upon theexercise by the Secretary of State of the executive power to interceptcommunications and, in particular, under what authority, to what extent and for what purposes this power has been exercised and to what useinformation so obtained has been put;  and to recommend whether, howand subject to what safeguards, this power should be exercised and in what circumstances information obtained by such means should be properly used or disclosed&quot;.3.     As to the legal authority for interception, the Committee take theview that the practice &quot;rests upon the power plainly recognised by thePost Office statutes as existing before the enactment of the statutes by whatever name the power is described&quot; (paragraph 50).    They considerthat the power extend to telegrams and find it &quot;difficult to resist theview that if there is a lawful power to intercept communications in theform of letters and telegrams then it is wide enough to cover telephonecommunications as well&quot; (paragraph 51).4.      The Committee express themselves as satisfied that all theofficers and officials concerned are scrupulous and conscientious in theuse and exercise of the power, that interception is highly selective, andthat it is used only where there is good reason to believe that a seriousoffence or security interest is involved (paragraph 123).    They recommend,subject to reservations by Mr. P.C. Gordon Walker, M. P. , that thepower of interception should continue to be used for the purposes forwhich it is used at present, subject to certain safeguards (paragraphs 139-152).    Mr. Gordon Walker would restrict the use of interception inrelation to crime to cases of a more extreme and urgent kind - forexample, where a dangerous criminal or lunatic is at large and likelyto commit violence or where a dangerous gang is committing violence and cannot be broken up by other means (paragraph 174).    In relation to security he considers that interception should be used only for (a) directcounter-espionage and protection of high secrets of State, and (b) trieC.(57) 24625th October, 1957CABINET
prevention of the employment of Fascists or Communists in connection withwork, the nature of which is vital to the State (paragraph 171).    The reportitself disposes of these suggestions.5.      The safeguards which the Committee recommend relate wholly to matters of procedure.     They are summarised in paragraphs 159-163 ofthe report and can all be accepted.6.     The Committee reject suggestions that the Secretary of State!should be assisted by a.n Advisory Committee and that warrants should beissued only on a sworn information before magistrates or a High court judge (paragraphs 85-86).7.      The Committee considered the Marrinan case at some length(paragraphs 91-101).     They report that &quot;there can be no doubt that the actions of Sir Hartley Shawcross and Viscount Tenby were whollygoverned by considerations of the public interest&quot;, but they recommendthat in future there should be no disclosure of information obtained on public grounds by the exercise of the power of interception &quot;to private individuals or private bodies or domestic tribunals of any kindwhatsoever&quot;,8.      The Committee heard evidence on the question whether there wasor had been unauthorised tapping of telephones in this country.    All theevidence was to the effect that there had not, and that for technical reasons it would be much more difficult here than in the United States.The Committee concluded, however, that there could be no certainty thatunauthorised tapping did not occur and they remark, without making a specific recommendation, that in these circumstances Parliament may wish to consider whether legislation should be passed to makeunauthorised telephone tapping an offence (paragraphs 129-131).9.      The Committee&apos;s report is being published in full and the PrimeMinister proposes to make a statement in the House of Commons on theday of publication (31st October) accepting the Committeers recommenda-tions.    Arrangements for a debate next session can be discussed throughthe usual channels.R.A.B.Home Office, s. W.l.24th October, 1957.-2-SECRET

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNCILLORSAPPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE INTERCEPTION OFCOMMUNICATIONSTo the Right Honourable Harold Macmillan, M.P.We, the undersigned Privy Councillors, having been appointed &quot; toconsider and report upon the exercise by the Secretary of State of the executive power to intercept communications and, in particular, under what authority,to what extent and for what purposes this power has been exercised and towhat use information so obtained has been put; and to recommend whether,how and subject to what safeguards, this power should be exercised and in what circumstances information obtained by such means should be properlyused or disclosed,&quot; submit the following Report.2. We were appointed on 29th June, 1957, and we held our first meeting in private on 2nd July. We held 16 further meetings for the purposes ofdiscussion and 12 meetings for the hearing of oral evidence.3. We heard evidence from all the Secretaries of State for the home department who have held office since 1939, the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State at the Home Office, and the officers in charge of those authorities thatuse interception of communications as part of their work.4. We received much assistance on the law from the Lord Chancellor,the Attorney-General, Sir Edwin Herbert, and others. Sir Hartley Shawcrossgave evidence about the Marrinan case. We also received a number ofvaluable memoranda. We called for records and files, selected at random,and examined them.5. We have confined our detailed investigations to the interception of communications over the last twenty years that is to say, to the period from1937 to 1957. This period covers pre-war and post-war practice, and thepractice under both the Administrations that have held office since the war.6. We have looked into the practice and procedure of a number of foreigncountries, Commonwealth countries and Colonial Territories.7. Following the example of the Secret Committee of both Houses ofParliament appointed in 1844 to consider the same problem that has been referred to us, we decided not to publish the evidence and.so informed thosewho gave evidence before us.8. We set out our conclusions and recommendations at length in thepages that follow.   The gist of our Report may be thus summarised:  (1) The origin of the power to intercept communications can only besurmised, but the power has been exercised from very early times;and has been recognised as a lawful power by a succession of statutescovering the last 200 years or more.(2) There is some difference of view on the authority to intercept telephonemessages. On one view the power is identical with the power to openletters and rests on the ancient power to intercept communications.Another view is that the power rests on a comparatively modernstatute. We discuss these views fully in our Report. (Paragraphs9-52.)
-   as(3) The power to intercept communications is exercised for the prevention and detection of serious crime and for the preservation of the safety of the State.(4) The power is now almost exclusively exercised by the MetropolitanPolice, the Board of Customs and Excise and the Security Service. Itis used with the greatest care and circumspection, under the strictestrules and safeguards, and never without the personal consideredapproval of the Secretary of State.   (Paragraphs 62-90.)(5) The use of the power has been effective in detecting major criminalsand preventing injury to national security.   (Paragraphs 107-113.)(6) The exercise of the power in these limited spheres should be allowedto continue under the same strict rules and supervision and in thespecial circumstances we have sei out. The criminal and the wrong-doer should not be allowed to use services provided by the State forwrongful purposes quite unimpeded, and the Police, the Customs, andthe Security Service ought not to be deprived of an effective weapon intheir efforts to preserve and maintain order for the benefit of thecommunity.   (Paragraphs 132-152.)(7) The interference with the privacy of the ordinary law-abiding citizenor&apos; with his individual liberty is infinitesimal, and only arises as an inevitable incident of intercepting the communications of some wrong-doer.   It has produced no harmful consequences.(8) Mr. Gordon Walker has reservations to sub-paragraphs (6) and (7)which he sets out in a separate Note of his own. (Paragraphs 170-179.)
PART ITHE AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE to intercept COMMUNICATIONS9. The origin of the authority of the Executive to intercept communica-tions is obscure,^ and it is not surprising that conflicting views about the source of the power have been placed before us. The first public referenceto the warrant of the Secretary of State authorising the opening of lettersis in the Proclamation of May 25th, 1663, which forbade the opening of anyletters or packets by anybody, except by the immediate warrant of thePrincipal Secretary of State. But long before this date the practice of openingletters had been followed.10., It is a singular circumstance that the source of the power has never been the subject of judicial pronouncement, and the text-book writers havenot discussed it in any fullness. In the fourth edition of Anson&apos;s Law andCustom of the Constitution, Vol. II, Part II, for example, the subject is thusdealt with:  &quot; The right and the duty, if occasion requires, of detaining and openingletters in the Post Office rests in Great Britain upon the Home Secretary,in Northern Ireland upon the Governor. This power, which extends totelegraphic communications, is occasionally, though not frequently,used .... and is extended to telegrams . . . .&quot;11. The existence of the power from early times has frequently beenacknowledged; its exercise has been publicly known; and the manner ofits exercise has been the subject of public agitation from time to time, andhas been made the subject of debate in the House of Commons and theHouse of Lords. In the year 1844, a great agitation arose in the country,because the Secretary of State, Sir James Graham, had issued a warrant to open the letters of Joseph Mazzini; and after debates in both Houses ofParliament, two Secret Committees were set up, one of the House of commons and one of the House of Lords. Both Committees were asked to inquire into the state of the law in respect of the detaining and opening of lettersat the General Post Office. It is significant that both Committees avoidedany discussion of the source of the authority upon which the Secretary ofState exercised his power, and were content to recognise the existence ofthe power to intercept communications, and to rely upon the various statuteswhich refer to the existence of the power.&quot; This is significant, because in the debates which preceded the setting up of the Committees, the origin of thepower had been discussed. In the House of Lords, Lord Campbell, whowas at that time a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,and afterwards was to be Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor, discussed the question, and in his Autobiography he says:  &quot; In the debates which arose this session upon the practice of openingletters at the Post Office under a warrant from the Secretary of State,I contended that it was neither authorised by common law nor statute,although the Secretary of State, like any other magistrate, or indeed any private individual, may seize and detain documents which constituteevidence of the commission of a crime.&quot;12. On the question of law, the Committee of the House of Commonsreported:   ,.&quot; The inquiry, therefore, what the state of the law now is respectingsuch detention and opening, is reduced to the inquiry what the state7
of the law was, respecting the same matter, immediately upon the passingof the Statute of Anne .... the law on the matter in question was thesame in 1711 that it is in 1844.&quot;13.   They also said on the point of law:  &quot; In preference to discussing the purely legal question, how far theStatute of Anne, in recognising the practice, on the part of the secretaries of State, of issuing Warrants to open Letters, rendered it lawful for the secretaries of State to issue such Warrants, Your Committee propose,so far as they have materials for that purpose, to give the history of this practice, prior and subsequent to the passing of that Statute: these materials being such as ought not to be overlooked in investigating thegrounds on which the exercise of this authority rests.&quot;14. Two further extracts from the history the Committee set out maybe given:  (a) &quot; It does not appear at what precise period the Crown undertook to- be the regular carrier of Letters for its subjects.  The Crown, doubtless,found it necessary, at a very early period, to the exercise of thefunctions of Sovereignty, to be able to convey with speed and security&apos;its own despatches from one part of the realm to another, and from and to parts beyond the seas; and for that purpose it appointedcertain messengers or runners, called the Posts. These Posts were alsoemployed for the personal convenience of the Sovereign, and the individuals composing the Royal Court. In course of time, a master of the Posts was appointed, and the first of these on record wasBrian Tuke, Esq., .... who held that office in 1516. . . .&quot;(b) &quot; The practice probably began at an early period, and afterwards grewinto a regular custom, of allowing private persons to avail themselves of the King&apos;s Posts for transmitting their correspondence. Thisprobably became a perquisite to the Postmasters, while, at the sametime, it gave to the Ministers of State the power of narrowly inspectingthe whole of the written communications of the country.&quot;15. The Committee of the House of Lords had two former lord chancellor&apos;s as members, Lord Brougham and Lord Cottenham, and in theirReport the Committee said:  .&quot; The Committee have not thought it necessary to attempt to define the Grounds upon which the Government has exercised the Power afforded by public Conveyance of Letters of obtaining such Information, as mightbe thought beneficial for the public Service; it seems sufficient for the. present Purpose to state, that the Exercise of this Power can be tracedfrom the earliest Institutions in this Country for the Conveyance of Letters,from Orders in Council of the 22nd of November, 1626, and 24th ofFebruary, 1627 .... In 1657, upon the first Establishment of a regular PostOffice, it was stated in the Ordinance to be the best Means to discoverand prevent any dangerous and wicked Designs against the Common-wealth. . . . The Power, therefore, appears to have been exercised fromthe earliest Period, and to have been recognised by several Acts ofParliament. This appears to the Committee to be the State of the Lawin respect to the detaining and opening of Letters at the Post Office, and, they do not find any other Authority for such detaining or opening.&quot;16. - The situation with regard to the opening and detaining of letters and^postal packets is substantially the same in 1957 as it was in 1844, forsection 58 (I) of the Post Office Act of 1953, which is the Act now governing
the opening and detaining of letters, is substantially in the same terms as theearlier statutes of 1908, 1837 and 1710.17. We have made these quotations from the two important Reportsof 1844, because it is clear that not only were questions of law debated in both Houses of Parliament, but both Committees considered the questionsof law with great care. Both Committees recognised that the executive had exercised the power of opening letters over a very long period of time,and neither Committee ever suggested or concluded that the exercise of thepower was in any way unlawful. Nor did they suggest in terms that theexercise of the power was the exercise of a prerogative right of the Crown.They leaned heavily upon the Post Office statutes, although none of: the statutes contain clauses conferring the power to intercept communications,but recognise the power as an existing power which it is lawful to exercise.18. In view of the conflicting opinions that have been put before us onthe source of the Secretary of State&apos;s power to intercept communications, wethink it best to set out briefly the arguments as they were presented to us;19. The first submission made was that the power of the Secretary ofState to issue his warrant for the interception and opening of letters wasin exercise of a prerogative right of the Crown. The Royal Prerogative hasbeen defined as comprehending all the special liberties, privileges and powersand royalties allowed by common law. It is created and limited by thecommon law.   Blackstone defined the Royal Prerogative in these words &quot; Prerogative can only be applied to those rights and capacities whichthe King enjoys alone in contradistinction to others and not to those whichhe enjoys in common with any of his subjects.&quot;20. It was contended before us that the procedure of opening letters sofar as it was known, and set out in the Secret Committees&apos; Reports of 1844,was such that in all respects it was proper to describe it as a prerogative&apos;right. The nature of that right was said to be a right to interceptcommunications. It is true that for some centuries, communications in factwere confined to letters and postal packets, but as science invented newmodes of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, and they came into general use, it was submitted that the prerogative power to inter-cept communications was wide enough to include not only letters and postalpackets, but every subsequent means of communication that became known and was used. The prerogative right, therefore, to intercept communicationsapplied now to letters and telegrams and telephonic communications alike.21. It would appear that the view entertained by the Home Office hasalways been that the power exercised by the Secretary of State is not expresslyconferred by statute, but that the statutes relating to the Post Office recognise the existence of the power as a lawful power for the purpose of making itclear that no offence is committed by a person who acts in obedience to a warrant of the Secretary of State issued by him in the exercise of that power.On this view the power exercised from the very earliest times is a prerogativepower to intercept, examine, and disclose for certain purposes connected withthe safety of the State or the preservation of public order, any messagescarried by the Crown; and this Prerogative attached to the new methods ofcarrying messages that were undertaken by the Crown in the nineteenth century by means of the telegraph and the telephone. It was conceded thatno new Prerogatives can be created, and the prerogative power to intercept a telephone message must therefore be the same prerogative power whichauthorises the interception of letters.9
22. In connection with this argument the principle must be borne in mind that, where the legislature has intervened and covered by statute the groundcovered by the Prerogative, the statute thereafter rules. But this doctrine doesnot seem applicable here, since there has been no intervention of this character by the legislature.23. The opponents of the view that the power to intercept is a prerogativepower emphasise the fact that no constitutional writer when dealing with theRoyal Prerogative, mentions this particular power as being a prerogativepower. In Chitty&apos;s Prerogatives of the Crown published in 1820, the learnedauthor states that he has attempted &quot; to present a comprehensive andconnected, yet compressed and logical, view of every prerogative and corres-ponding right of the subject&quot;; but nowhere is any reference made to a pre-rogative power of detaining and opening communications. Reliance is alsoplaced on the doctrine laid down by Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington,19 State Trials 1030. In the year 1762, the Secretary of State issued a warrant directing certain persons to search for John Entick, the author ofcertain numbers of &quot; The Monitor or British Freeholder,&quot; and to seize him,&quot; together with his books and papers,&quot; and to bring them to the Secretary ofState. Certain messengers, empowered by the warrant, seized Mr. Entickin his house, and seized Kis papers. Entick brought an action in trespassagainst the messengers for seizure of his papers. The case was tried beforethe Lord Chief Justice and a jury, and the jury returned a special verdict,which is very lengthy, and is set out in the report of the case. If the defendants were liable, the jury assessed the damages at  300. This specialverdict was twice argued in the Court of Common Pleas at great length, andwith much learning; and finally in 1765 Lord Camden delivered the elaboratejudgment which was the judgment of the Court. Many questions were arguedand decided, but the main question was the legality of the general warrant.Lord Camden declared that the practice of issuing general warrants wasillegal and unconstitutional. The jury found by their special verdict that thepractice of.issuing general warrants had been in existence for many years,but Lord Camden nevertheless denied their legality.24. It was suggested that the arguments used to support the legality of general warrants before Lord Camden and his fellow judges were the samearguments used to support the prerogative power exercised .by the Secretaryof State to intercept communications, namely that no court of justice hadever declared the powers to be illegal, that the powers were essential togovernment, and the only means of quieting clamours and seditions. LordCamden said &quot; With respect to the practice itself, if it goes no higher, every lawyerwill tell you it is much too modern to be evidence of the common law;and if it be added that these warrants ought to acquire some strength bythe silence of those courts which have heard them read so oftenupon returns without censure or animadversion, I am able to borrow myanswer to that pretence from the Court of King&apos;s Bench, which latelydeclared with great unanimity in the case of General Warrants that as noobjection was taken to them on the returns and the matter passed subsilentiq, the precedents were of no weight. I most heartily concur in that opinion. . . .&quot;&quot; To search, seize, and carry away all the papers of the subject on thefirst warrant: that such a right should have existed from the time whereofthe memory of man runneth not to the contrary, and never yet have founda place in any book of law; is incredible. But if so strange a thing couldbe supposed, I do not see how we could declare the law upon such evidence.&quot;
&quot;... If it is law it will be found in our books.   If it is not to be foundthere it is not law.&quot;25. It was submitted in reply that there is a distinction to be drawn between the general warrants condemned by Lord Camden, and the limited,strictly governed use of the Secretary of State&apos;s warrant into the exercise ofwhich we have been enquiring; and in this connexion we emphasise once more the exact nature of the procedure we set out in Part II of this Report.26. It was further pointed out that the provisions of section 9 (I)of the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947 giving certain immunities to theCrown are inconsistent with the existence of a prerogative power for thesection provides that &quot; . . . . no proceedings in tort shall lie against the Crownfor anything done or omitted to be done in relation to a postal packet byany person while employed as a servant or agent of the Crown, or for anything done or omitted to be done in relation to a telephonic communicationby any person whilst so employed; nor shall any officer of the Crown besubject, save at the suit of the Crown, to any civil liability for any of thematters aforesaid.&quot; It may very well be that in 1947 the question ofintercepting a telephone message was not in contemplation, and therefore no reference was made to a prerogative power, but the words of the sectionare very wide in their terms.27. An alternative view was put before us which differed in some respects from the assertion of the prerogative right, but scarcely differed in substance.It was submitted that the origin of the power of the Secretary of State to intercept communications lay in a common law right which was not a partof the Prerogative, but which derived from an inherent power in the crown to protect the realm against the misuse of postal facilities by ill-disposedpersons. This common law right, it was said, continues to exist and is recognised in the Post Office statutes. No statute has enacted the power inexpress terms, but in addition to recognising and acknowledging the power,the statutes have indicated certain ways in which the power should beexercised, as for example, by the issue of a warrant by the Secretary of Stateauthorising the interception to be made.28. No support for this view is to be found in any judicial pronouncement,or in any legal text book. Indeed in Chitty&apos;s Royal Prerogative in Englandpublished in 1830, the learned author says at page 166 &quot; In modern times the prerogative of the Crown has been so strictly defined by law .... that though the old doctrines of absolute sovereigntyand transcendent domination still disfigure our law books, they arelittle heard of elsewhere. Occasionally however it happens that in parliamentary discussions, assertions are hazarded of latentprerogatives in the Crown which are supposed to be inherent in thevery nature of sovereignty. That such pretensions are unfounded itis not difficult to make out.&quot;......29. It was said before us that this common law power which was clearlyan ancient power and derived from the actions of the monarchy when seeking to safeguard the realm, was a power wide enough to cover every form ofcommunication which might come into being at any time. This secondview is difficult to distinguish from the first view save that the use of theword &quot; Prerogative &quot; is avoided.30. A third argument was put before us, which we summarise inparagraphs 31-37, that from the earliest times the power to intercept and open letters had been in existence. Throughout many centuries the practicehad continued. How it arose can only be conjectured because historicalrecords are wanting, but that the power existed and was used permits ofno doubt whatever.11
21331. The Ordinance of 1657 recited in the Preamble that one of theadvantages of erecting and settling one General Post Office was that it &quot; wasthe best means to discover and prevent many dangerous and wicked designswhich have been and are daily contrived against the peace and welfare of theCommonwealth, the intelligence whereof cannot well be communicated, butby letter of escript.&quot; One of the principal objects of that Ordinance, it wassuggested, was to prohibit persons other than the Postmaster-General fromconveying letters, and the public reference to &quot; discovering many dangerous and wicked designs &quot; would seem to throw some light on the probable origin of the power. The Act of Parliament of 1660 followed the Ordinance of 1657and agreed mutatis mutandis with its content. The Proclamation of 1663prohibiting the opening of letters save by the warrant of the Secretary ofState would seem to imply that it was not unlawful to open a letter before that Proclamation, otherwise the prohibition would have been superfluous.The object of the legislation of 1657 and 1660 was to create a monopoly forthe Crown and to ensure that I he letters would be carried by persons appointed or licensed by the Crown, with the object of enabling the crown to inspect the contents of the letters carried. It was also pointed out thatin none of these public declarations was there any assertion of the royal prerogative. The origin of the power to intercept letters, on this view, wasthe result of the creation of a monopoly, created and developed for this among other purposes; and the opening and detaining of letters by the Crown tookplace not because of any prerogative right, but upon the footing that thosewho entrusted their letters to the Posts would render them open to inspectionat the wish of the Crown. It is of course understandable how this power should be referred to as a Prerogative, because the Crown alone couldexercise the power; but, however the power is described, it was said that fromthe 17th century at least it cannot be doubted that the power to open lettershas been lawfully exercised by the Crown.32. In 1710, an Act was passed &quot; for establishing a General Post office for all Her Majesty&apos;s Dominions, etc.&quot; and again it was enacted by section 40&quot; that no person .... shall presume to open, detain, or delay .... any ....Letter after same is or shall be delivered into the General or other PostOffice . . . . except by an express Warrant in Writing under the Hand ot oneof&apos; the Principal Secretaries of State for every such opening, detaining, ordelaying.....&quot;33.   Section 58 (I) of the Post Office Act, 1953 provides-&quot; If any officer of the Post Office, contrary to his duty, opens ....any postal packet in course of transmission by post, or wilfully detains ordelays .... any such postal packet, he shall be guilty of amisdemeanour. ....Provided that nothing in this section shall extend to the opening,detaining or delaying of a postal packet returned for want of a truedirection, or returned by reason that the person to whom it is directedhas refused it, or has refused or neglected to pay the postage thereof, or that the packet cannot for any other reason be delivered, or to the opening,detaining or delaying of a postal packet under the authority of this Actor in obedience to an express warrant in writing under the hand of a secretary of State.&quot;34.   Postal packet is defined in section 87 (I) as meaning-&quot;A letter, postcard, reply postcard, newspaper, printed packet, samplepacket, or parcel, and every packet or article transmissible by post, and includes a telegram.&quot;
35. Section 58 of the Act of 1953 reproduces section 56 of the PostOffice Act, 1908 which reproduces section 25 of the Post Office (Offences)Act, 1837 which in return re-enacted without material amendment section 40of the Post Office (Revenue) Act of 1710.36. The legal position since 1710 and now is that an officer of the PostOffice who opens, delays or detains a postal packet commits an offence unless it is his duty to do so, or one of the conditions mentioned in the sectionas justifying his conduct is satisfied. It is a defence to show that the letter was opened, delayed or detained on the authority of the Secretary of State&apos;swarrant. -37. As telegrams are postal packets for the purposes of the Post OfficeAct of 1953, and are telegraphic messages for the purposes of the TelegraphAct of 1869 by virtue of section 3, it is an offence for an officer of the PostOffice to &quot; open, delay or detain &quot; a telegram in course of transmission by post unless it is his duty so to do, or the opening, &amp;c, is authorised by the warrant of the Secretary of State, or it is justified on one or other of thegrounds mentioned in section 58 (I) of the Post Office Act, 1953.38. We have thought it right to set out at some length the different views which were expressed to us by high legal authorities. We recognisethat we have no authority ourselves to decide between these conflicting views and to declare the law. We have been impressed by the fact that manySecretaries of State in many Administrations for many years past have actedupon the view that the power to intercept communications was in the natureof a prerogative power. It had never been thought necessary for any statuteto confer the right, but all the statutes had recognised the right as an existingright at the time of their enactment. It was beyond doubt that the powerhad existed independently of the statutes, its precise origin alone remaining in doubt.39. If the problem confronting us had merely been concerned withletters, we should have been inclined to follow the example of the two SecretCommittees in 1844, and to say that there can be no doubt whatever of these things (a) The power to intercept letters and postal packets and to disclose theircontents and otherwise to make use of them had been used and frequently used through many centuries.(b) Such a power existed and was exercised widely and publicly knownas the debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lordsplainly showed. :(c) At no time had it been suggested with any authority that the exerciseof the power was unlawful.But we recognise that the chief controversy which resulted in the setting upof the present committee was concerned with the interception of telephonemessages, and therefore we do not feel able to leave the matters in questionquite as the two Secret Committees were able to do.40. The power to intercept telephone messages has been exercised inthis country from time to time since the introduction of the telephone; anduntil the year 1937, the Post Office acted upon the view that the power, whichthe Crown exercised in intercepting telephone messages, was a powerpossessed by any other operator of telephones and was not contrary to law.No, warrants by the Secretary of State were therefore issued,; and any arrangements for the interception of telephone conversations were madedirectly between the Security Service or the Police Authorities and theDirector-General of the Post Office.
21541. In 1937 the position was reviewed by the Home Secretary and thePostmaster-General and it was then decided, as a matter of policy, that it was undesirable that records of telephone conversations should be made by PostOffice servants and disclosed to the Police or to the Security Service withoutthe authority of the Secretary of State. Apart from thinking that the formerpractice was undesirable, the Home Office was of opinion that the power onwhich they had acted to intercept letters and telegrams on the authorityof a warrant issued by the Secretary of State, was wide enough in its natureto include the interception of telephone messages also. It was accordingly decided to act on this view of the law, and it has since been the practice ofthe Post Office to intercept telephone conversations only on the expresswarrant of the Secretary of State, that is, upon the authority which hadalready been recognised in the statutes to which we have referred dealingwith letters and telegrams.&quot;42. If it be said that a prerogative right could not extend to the interception of telephone conversations, because telephones were undreamtof when the prerogative power was first taken and exercised, reference shouldbe made to the case of In re a Petition of Right, 1915 3 K.B. 659 in theCourt of Appeal (Cozens-Hardy, M. R., Pickford and Warrington L.JJ),when Lord Cozens-Hardy said in affirming the judgment of Avory J. &quot; If it be said that the prerogative right cannot extend to an aerodromebecause aeroplanes were unknown in the reign of Richard I., I thinkthat the answer is to be found in the somewhat analogous case ofMercer v. Denne (1905) 2 Ch. 538, 585, where this Court held that acustomary right to &apos; cutch&apos; fishing nets was not limited to materialsknown in the reign of Richard I., but extended to drying nets with suitable materials. So the prerogative applies to what is reasonably necessary for preventing and repelling invasion at the present time, regard being had to the invention of gunpowder and the use of aeroplanes inwarfare.&quot;Warrington L.J. said &quot; The circumstances under which the power may be exercised and theparticular acts which may be done in the exercise thereof must of necessityvary with the times and the advance of military science . . . .&quot;43. The prerogative power in question in that case was the power totake lands without compensation for the purposes of the Defence of the Realm,but if in the question we have to consider, the existence of a prerogativepower to intercept all communications was established, the objection thatthe telephone was a modern invention would not defeat the application of thepower.44. But if the view accepted and followed by the Home Office for manyyears is rejected, then it was submitted that the power to intercept telephonemessages was governed by special considerations which were somewhat different from those that govern the question of letters and telegrams. Ifthere be no prerogative power governing all communications, and thusincluding telephonic communications, and if there be no power at common law to the like effect, then the only relevant statutory reference to beconsidered, would be section 20 of the Telegraph Act of 1868.45.   The material words of the section are &quot; Any person having official duties connected with the Post Office,or acting on behalf of the Postmaster-General, who shall, contrary tohis duty, disclose or in any way make known or intercept the contents
or any part of the contents of any telegraphic messages or any message&quot; intrusted to the Postmaster-General for the purpose of transmission,shall in England and in Ireland be guilty of a misdemeanour, . . . andthe Postmaster-General shall make regulations to carry out the intentions of this section, and to prevent the improper use of any person in his employer or acting on his behalf of any knowledge he may acquire ofthe contents of any telegraphic message.&quot;46. No regulations have in fact been made under this section. It is alittle difficult to think that the word &quot; intercept&quot; in section 20 of the Act of1868 contemplated the listening in to telephone conversations for the telephoneexchange was only instituted in England in 1879 and then there were onlyseven or eight subscribers.47. In the case of the Attorney-General v. Edison Telephone Company,1880 6 Q.B.D. p. 244, it was held that a telephone conversation is a &quot;tele-graphic commmunication &quot; for the purposes of the Telegraph Acts, thoughat the time of the decision the question of listening into or intercepting a telephone message was not being considered.48. In view of the decision, however, it was argued that by reason ofsection 20 of the Telegraph Act of 1868 it was open to the Postmaster-general to instruct post office officials and those acting on his behalf to listen in, to record and disclose telephone conversations, just as he had the power to intercept, disclose and make known the contents of a telegram. It was alsoargued that the fact that it is not now the practice for the Postmaster-general to give any such instructions except on the authority of the Secretary of State&apos;swarrant had no legal significance.49. If this argument is rejected, then it was submitted that, so far as the interception of telephone messages is concerned, reliance could be placed onthe doctrine followed until 1937 that the Post Office was entitled to interceptand that it was not unlawful to do so, and that in any event the provisionsof the Crown Proceedings Act made the Post Office immune from any legal action for any acts relating to the telephone.50. We should not be happy to feel that so important a power as thepower to intercept telephone messages rested on either of the grounds set outin paragraphs 44-49. We favour the view that it rests upon the power plainlyrecognised by the Post Office statutes as existing before the enactment of the statutes, by whatever name the power is described.51. We are therefore of the opinion that the state of the law might fairly be expressed in this way.(a) The power to intercept letters has been exercised from the earliesttimes, and has been recognised in successive Acts of Parliament.(b) This power extends to telegrams.(c) It is difficult to resist the view that if there is a lawful power to interceptcommunications in the form of letters and telegrams, then it is wide enough to cover telephone communications as well.52. If, however, it should be thought that the power to intercept telephonemessages was left in an uncertain state that was undesirable, it would be for parliament to consider what steps ought to be taken to remove all uncertaintyif the practice is to continue. So far as letters and telegrams are concerned,the provisions of the Post Office Act of 1953 appear to have worked in practicewithout any difficulty. If it were thought necessary, a suitable amendment tothat section of the Act of 1953 would remove doubts whether telephoniccommunications were in the same position as letters and telegrams.
-    217PART IIPURPOSE, USE AND EXTENT OF THE POWER OFINTERCEPTION1. Purpose53. We were further instructed under our terms of reference &quot; to consider and report upon the exercise by the Secretary of State of the executive power to intercept communications and, in particular, ... to what extent andfor what purposes this power has been exercised and to what use informationso obtained has been put.&quot;54. The exercise by the Secretary of State of the executive power to intercept communications is by warrant under his own hand (and in the caseof Scotland under the hand of the Secretary of State for Scotland). If either of these Secretaries of State were ill or absent the power would be exercisedon his behalf by another Secretary of State: but this has very rarely happened.55. It is to-day the invariable practice that the interception of communi-cations is carried out only on the authority of one or other of these twoSecretaries of State (see paragraph 41 above).56. The warrant of the Secretary of State sets out the name and addressor telephone number of the persons whose communications are to be inter-cepted. On occasion, a single warrant has been issued in the past to cover a number of names. We think this practice is undesirable. In our opinioneach warrant should in future specify the name and address or telephonenumber of the person who is the subject of the warrant.57. The Secretary of State has to satisfy himself on the facts of each particular case that it is proper to issue his warrant. In practice the principle on which the Secretary of State acts is that the purposes for which com-munications may be intercepted must be either for the detection of seriouscrime or for the safeguarding of the security of the State.58. We discuss first the procedure in relation to crime. changing circumstances during the past twenty years have made some acts seriousoffences that were not previously so regarded. For instance, during andfor a period after the last war, breaches of food regulations were for a timeserious offences. After the war, exchange control was introduced to protect the nation&apos;s gold and dollar reserves, and attempts to contravene its provisions are still regarded as serious offences.59. On the other hand, some offences which had previously beenconsidered serious enough to justify warrants for the interception of communications have ceased to be so regarded. The interception of letters*to prevent the transmission of illegal lottery material began in 1909 but was abandoned in November 1953. The main grounds for the decision to ceaseinterception for this purpose were, we were told, doubts about its efficacyand the feeling that, owing to the changed public attitude towards lotteries,it was no longer necessary or appropriate to use this power for this particularpurpose.60. In the 1930&apos;s considerable numbers of warrants were issued for the interception of letters, mainly passing to or from places abroad, believed to contain obscene and indecent matter. The number of warrants steadilydeclined after the war and none has been issued in the last two and a half*In this Report &quot; letters &quot; includes postal packets and telegrams except where theyare expressly excluded.
years. We were informed that one of the main reasons for this was not any doubt as to the efficacy of methods of interception in this case but a growingreluctance to use the expedient of interception for this particular purpose.61. The issue of warrants for the interception of letters in connectionwith offences under the Dangerous Drugs Acts began in 1922. After the warthe number of warrants sharply declined and no warrants have been issuedsince early in 1956. This coincided with a decline in the traffic in drugs.The Department of the Home Office concerned with the administration of the dangerous Drugs Acts and with duties under the International NarcoticsConventions is of the opinion that it might again become necessary to interceptletters in the discharge of its statutory and international obligations.62. . Since the Secretary of State&apos;s discretion is absolute he may issue a warrant for the interception of communications to any person, authority,agency or Department of State; but in fact such warrants have been grantedto a limited number of authorities. We set out in Appendix II a list of allthe authorities to whom warrants have been issued over the past twenty years.63. The great majority of warrants for interception for the purpose ofthe detection of crime have been, and are now, granted to the MetropolitanPolice and Board of Customs and Excise. In what we say below about the interception of communications for the detection of crime, we confine ourobservations to these two authorities. For the sake of brevity we sometimesrefer to them as the &quot; Police &quot; and the &quot; Customs.&quot;64. The principles on which the Home Office acts in deciding whether to grant an application for a warrant to intercept communications for thedetection of crime were first reduced to writing in letters in similar termssent to the Metropolitan Police and Customs in September 1951. These letterswere occasioned by a recent increase in the number of applications and anincrease in the number rejected by the Home Office. It was stated in these letters that the procedure of interception was &quot; an inherently objectionableone,&quot; that &quot; the power to stop letters and intercept telephone calls must beused with great caution,&quot; and that it must be regarded as &quot; an exceptionalmethod.&quot; In particular, three conditions were laid down both for the police and for the Customs that must be satisfied before a warrant could be issued.These were:  -(a) The offence must be really serious.: (b) Normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, ormust, from the nature of things, be unlikely to succeed if tried,(c) There must be good reason to think that an interception would resultin a conviction.65. It was indicated in the letter to the Police that what the HomeOffice regarded as &quot; serious crime&quot; were offences for which a man with no previous record could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to threeyears&apos; imprisonment, or offences of lesser gravity in which a large number of people were involved.66. The type of crime that the Customs seek to detect is necessarilysomewhat different from the violent crime with which the MetropolitanPolice is mainly concerned. The definition of &quot; serious crime &quot; upon whichthe Home Office acts when considering the issue of warrants to the Customsis that &quot;the case involves a substantial and continuing fraud which would seriously damage the revenue or the economy of the country if it wentunchecked.&quot;67. The arrangements concerning the issue of warrants to the security service are similar, but the objectives of the Security Service are different
-    219from those of the Police or Customs. The Home Office considers each case.The principles governing the issue of warrants to the Security Service canbe stated in these terms:  (a) There must be a major subversive or espionage activity that is likelyto injure the national interest.(b) The material likely to be obtained by interception must be of directuse in compiling the information that is necessary to the security service in carrying out the tasks laid upon it by the State.68. The same provision applies to the Security Service as to the customs and Police about the failure of normal means of detection. But less stressis laid on the need to secure convictions, since the Security Service is primarily concerned with safeguarding the State and keeping itself informed about dangers to its security. Besides securing convictions, the security service has the duty to keep up to date its information covering espionageand subversion and to inform Ministers and Departments of State aboutsecurity matters that concern them.69. The Metropolitan Police, the Customs and Excise and the security service have adopted policies and internal procedures designed to ensurethat warrants are sought only when they satisfy the appropriate conditions laid down by the Home Office. The request for a warrant can be sent tothe Home Office only by the Chief of the authority concerned or his deputy.70. .A11 applications for warrants to intercept communications for thedetection of crime are considered by senior officers in the Criminal Departmentof the Home Office, who, if they approve the application, submit it to thePermanent Under-Secretary of State, who, if he considers that sufficient casehas been made out, submits the application to the Secretary of State for his personal decision. Applications for warrants sought by the Security Servicego in. the first place direct to the Permanent Under-Secretary. All the secretaries of State who appeared before us said that they gave close personalconsideration to every request for a warrant submitted to them. If theprocedure that has been laid down is faithfully followed, there are likelyto be very few applications that need to be rejected and this was in factconfirmed by the evidence.71. Close supervision over the use of methods of interception is main-tained by the Home Office. There is a quarterly review of outstandingwarrants by the Permanent Under-Secretary. At this review, or earlierif the Home Office thinks that warrants have not been cancelled after areasonable period, the authorities concerned are sent for and asked to makea case for their continuance. Not only are individual warrants reviewed inthis manner but also the number of warrants in operation. We have already referred to the letters sent by the Home Office in 1951 to the MetropolitanPolice and Customs (above paragraph 64). A further letter was sent to theMetropolitan Police in April 1956 drawing attention to the increase in thefigures of warrants granted during the previous five years and emphasising the need to keep applications to a minimum. This led to the adoption bythe Metropolitan Police of a new and more effective system of review whichreduced the average duration of warrants and brought about an increase inthe proportion of arrests to interceptions.72; The Customs have a regular quarterly review of all outstandingwarrants individually. A similar review is undertaken by the Security Serviceevery six months. Since 1956 the Metropolitan Police has instituted a weeklyreview every Monday. All these authorities cancel warrants when they are considered to be of no further use without waiting for their own regularreview of outstanding warrants.
220- 73. The authority concerned, when an interception is no longer needed,immediately instructs the Post Office to discontinue the interception. TheCustoms and Police inform the Home Office forthwith and ask for the formal cancellation of the warrant. The Security Service does this only at three-monthly intervals. We should point out that despite this variation of practice we have found no evidence of interceptions being kept on longer than was thought necessary for the case in hand.74. We feel that the outstanding warrants should be reviewed more frequently. We therefore recommend that there should be a regular reviewnot less than once a month both by the Home Office and by every authority that is granted a warrant to intercept. This review should be not only of thenumbers of warrants outstanding, but of each particular warrant.75. We recommend that warrants should no longer be valid until they arecancelled, but that their validity should be for a defined period that appearson their face. Normally this should be for a period no longer than a month and in no case should it be for a period longer than two months. If anextension of the validity of the warrant is desired, the reasons for this shouldbe sent to the Home Office for their consideration before any extension is approved.76. We recommend that when a warrant for the interception of communi-cations is cancelled by the authority to whom it was issued, this cancellationshould be forthwith reported to the Home Office.77. The Secret Committee of the House of Lords in its Report of 1844thought that &quot; a more detailed account than is already kept of the groundsupon which each warrant is granted would frequently have the effect of leavingin the Office a grave accusation, without affording an opportunity of Reply orDefence.&quot;78. But we are of opinion that the keeping of full and accurate recordsis a necessary part of any procedure to ensure that the use to whichinterception may be put is effectively controlled. The Home Office records ofwarrants issued for the detection of crime are reasonably fall. Each case is separately recorded in-a file. These all contain the ground on whichthe warrant was issued, a copy of the warrant itself and the date of itscancellation.79. We think that in one or two respects the procedure could be improved. For example we found that in some cases part of the consultationsbetween the Home Office and the authority seeking or in possession of a warrant had been oral, and had not been recorded. In a few cases there wasno precise record of the usefulness or otherwise of the interception. Therewere no records of the rejection by the Home Office of applications forwarrants.80. Until 1947 the Home Office kept a card index of names and addressesshowing alphabetically by name and geographically by area all the warrantsissued for security purposes. In 1947, at the suggestion of the security service, which was disturbed by the existence of these records in the HomeOffice, all of them were destroyed and no complete records were kept thereafterexcept for the serial numbers of the warrants issued. From 1954 the coveringminutes were also preserved we examined a number of them. These minutescontain very brief summaries of the reasons for the issue of each warrant.81. The Metropolitan Police destroyed all warrants between 1937 and1946 upon their cancellation, and the same practice was followed from 1946-1953, except that a bare record was kept of the number of interceptions
221authorised by the Secretary of State. Detailed records exist only from 19531The Security Service also destroyed detailed records before 1952 although itkept figures of the numbers of warrants issued. It was not possible to discover the exact number of interceptions in earlier years, but only thenumber of warrants issued; the discrepancy between these two figures would,however, be very small indeed.82. We wish to emphasise that none of the matters referred to in the threepreceding paragraphs has in practice affected the strict control of the useof the power to intercept communications.83. Arrangements to keep fuller and more uniform records were madeearly in 1957 by the Home Office before our inquiry was announced. Wewere informed that, since our inquiry started, the Home Office has worked out an elaborate system for keeping records on a uniform basis, both for security.purposes and for the detection of crime.84. It is not necessary that such secret records should be kept in a numberof different places, but they should be preserved in one secure place. Wetherefore recommend that full records should be kept in the Home Officeshowing in each particular case (a) The ground on which the warrant is applied for.(b) A note of any subsequent decisions concerning the warrant.(c) A copy of the warrant issued, or, alternatively, a note that theapplication has been rejected.(d) A record of the date of the cancellation of the warrant and the reasontherefor.These records should be preserved for a reasonable time by the Home Office.Before any warrants or any records relating to them are destroyed by theauthority to whom the warrants were issued, the Home Office should be consulted.85. It has been urged in some quarters that.the authority for the issueof warrants for interception should not be left exclusively in the hands of theSecretary of State. The chief suggested alternatives that have come to our attention are that the Home Secretary should be&quot; assisted by an AdvisoryCommittee or that warrants should be issued only on a sworn informationbefore magistrates or a High Court judge.86. In our opinion, neither of these proposals would improve matters.If a number of magistrates or judges had the power to issue such warrants,the control of the use to which methods of interception can be put would beweaker than under the present system. It might very well prove easier inpractice to obtain warrants. Moreover, it would be harder to keep aridcollate records. If an Advisory Committee were set up this would, at thebest, leave things as at present because the ultimate discretion would still lie with the Secretary of State; at the worst it would tend to weaken the sense ofresponsibility of the Secretary of State, and might lead to a loosening of theprinciples, the strict maintenance of which is the chief means of ensuring that interception of communications is limited to the uses for which it isintended. .87. One exceptional purpose for which the Secretary of State issueswarrants for the interception of communications is the stopping and returningof letters to the sender. This power has long been exercised and was referredto by the Secret Committee of the House of Commons of 1844 in their Report.Beyond stating that some doubt existed how far this could lawfully be done and giving the number of such warrants issued as 7 over a period of 45years they made no further comment or recommendation.
- 88. In recent years this power has been exercised somewhat more frequently, but still on a very small scale. From 1946-57 there were 28 cases in all. We have examined all these cases in detail and have found that,in all but one or two instances, warrants were issued only on the grounds of a major public interest.89. It seems to us that the interception of letters for this purpose fallsinto quite a distinct category in that no one suffers any damage if a sendeesown letter is returned to him. There might, however, be administrative difficulties if the interception of letters at the sender&apos;s request became ageneral practice. We therefore feel that this power should be exercised onlyin cases where in the opinion of the Secretary of State a clear public interest is involved.90. As a result of our inquiry into the purposes for which warrantsauthorising the interception of communications are issued, we are satisfiedthat Secretaries of State and all the officials and authorities concerned havetaken, and continue to take, scrupulous care to ensure the strict observance of the purposes to which it is intended by the Home Office that the interception of communications should be directed and confined.2. The Marrinan Case91. Since it was the warrant of the then Secretary of State, giving powerto intercept the telephone communications of one, Billy Hill, which gave riseto what is now known as the Marrinan case, we have felt it right to considerthat case with great care so far as it would appear to be relevant to our inquiry.92. It has been the settled policy of the Home Office that, save in themost exceptional cases, information obtained by the interception oicommunications should be used only for the purposes of detection, and not as evidence in a Court or in any other Inquiry.93. We have listened to the evidence of the Attorney-General,Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller; to Sir Hartley Shawcross, the Chairmanof the Bar Council; and to Viscount Tenby, who was the Secretary of state at the relevant time.94.   It will be convenient to set out a summary of the principal dates:  (1) On the 9th October, 1956, reports appeared in certain newspapersof a case tried at the Central Criminal Court, where it was alleged that a barrister had obstructed the police when they were acting inthe course of their duty in Dublin.(2) On the 17th October, Mr. Boulton, the secretary of the Bar Council,wrote for information to Mr. R. E. Seaton, the counsel who hadprosecuted in the case, and in the meantime Mr. Seaton himself had informed the Attorney-General of the circumstances.(3) On the 26th October the Attorney-General brought to the notice ofthe Bar Council the alleged professional misconduct on the part ofMr. Marrinan.(4) On the 20th November Mr. Boulton wrote to Mr. R. L. Jackson,the Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of the CriminalInvestigation Department, to ask him whether any information was available about Mr. Marrinan&apos;s alleged unprofessional conduct.(5) On the 26th November Mr. Jackson was authorised by the HomeSecretary to show to Sir Hartley Shawcross personally, as Chairmanof the Bar Council, the material obtained in June and July 1956 inthe course of the interception of the telephone line of Billy Hill.
223(6) On the 12th December Mr. Boulton, in Sir Hartley Shawcross&apos;sabsence abroad, called upon Mr. Jackson. He appears to have been regarded as the personal representative of Sir Hartley Shawcross ratherthan the secretary of the Bar Council, for he was shown a copy of thetranscript of the intercepted telephone conversations. Mr. Jackson wasnot present at that interview, but on the 18th December he showed the transcript of the intercepted telephone conversations toSir Hartley Shawcross, and told him that if he thought it necessary toshow it to other people, Sir Hartley should himself seek the authorityof the Home Secretary so to do. He informed Sir Hartley Shawcrossin some detail of the view of the Police about the character and activities of Billy Hill. Sir Hartley was informed that Mr. Marrinanwas believed to be acting improperly in concert with Hill in certain matters, well knowing him to be a criminal, and that Scotland Yardhad been interested in the activities of Mr. Marrinan for some considerable time.(7) Sir Hartley informed the Assistant Commissioner of Police that theintercepts of the telephone conversations would be valueless to himunless he had permission to show them to the members of the BarCouncil who were inquiring into the conduct of Mr. Marrinan, andalso to the Benchers of Lincoln&apos;s Inn who might be inquiring intoMr. Marrinan&apos;s conduct, and also to Mr. Marrinan himself.(8) Accordingly Sir Hartley Shawcross on the same day (the18th December) wrote to ask for the Home Secretaries authority to disclose the transcripts of the interceptions to the persons mentionedin (7) above.(9) On the 20th December, 1956, a letter was sent to Sir Hartley Shawcrossby the Permanent Under-Secretary of State on behalf of the HomeSecretary giving to Sir Hartley theauthority he had sought.95. There can be no doubt that the actions of Sir Hartley Shawcrossand Viscount Tenby were wholly governed by considerations of the publicinterest.96. Apart from the evidence contained in the telephone intercepts, therewas a good deal of additional evidence in Sir Hartley&apos;s possession concerningMr. Marrinan which in Sir Hartley&apos;s view directly affected the integrity ofthe Bar and the proper administration of justice. He was aware that in someother countries the improper association of members of the legal professionwith avowed criminals was known to exist, and that this association was for the purpose of assisting criminals in their unlawful activities, and was highly injurious to the proper administration of justice. It was for these reasons that he decided to ask the Secretary of State to disclose the telephoneintercepts to him and to his colleagues on the Bar Council, and to permithim to show them to the Benchers of Lincoln&apos;s Inn who were concerned withthe professional conduct of Mr. Marrinan as a member of Lincoln&apos;s Inn, andalso to Mr. Marrinan himself. He did this, he insisted before us, because hethought the integrity of the Bar was of vital importance to the properadministration of justice in this country; and as Chairman of the Bar Councilhe felt that a special responsibility lay upon him to preserve this integrity,and he regarded the administration of justice as being one of the mostimportant public functions exercised in the State, and the peculiar care ofthe Home Office.97. Viscount Tenby, who was at the time the Secretary of State, himself had an interview with the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr. Jackson,and heard from him in detail the view which the police entertained of Hill
-and his activities. When the request therefore was made to him bySir Hartley Shawcross, the Chairman of the Bar Council, to allow the BarCouncil and the Benchers of Lincoln\s Inn, and Mr. Marrinan, to see theintercepts, Viscount Tenby regarded the case &quot; as the most exceptional thatI had ever come across.&quot; In view of the information he had received fromthe Assistant Commissioner of Police concerning the character of Hill, andin particular the fact that he was carrying on his activities in connivance witha member of the Bar such as Mr. Marrinan, Viscount Tenby came to theconclusion that the circumstances were so utterly exceptional and the ground of the application was of such high importance, that he would depart fromthe normal practice which he and his predecessors had always followed.98. Viscount Tenby was most clearly impressed first of all by theevidence given to him of the character of Hill, and in turn by the argumentof Sir Hartley Shawcross that in his view the actions of Mr. Marrinan were such that they struck at the very heart of the proper administration of thelaw. Thereupon he made the two decisions with which we have been con-cerned. He decided to disclose the intercepts to Sir Hartley Shawcrosspersonally, and then also decided to consent to Sir Hardey Shawcross&apos;s subse-quent request for permission to show the intercepts to the Bar Council, theBenchers of Lincoln&apos;s Inn, and to Mr. Marrinan. These two decisions were clearly within the powers of the Secretary of State, and it is right to saythat Viscount Tenby accepts the fullest responsibility for them.99. Viscount Tenby regarded the situation as being utterly exceptional,and there does not appear to have been any previous case which could in any sense be regarded as a precedent. The closest parallel that we have dis-covered occurred in 1953, in a disciplinary inquiry before the MetropolitanPolice Discipline Board into charges of corruption against two police officers.In that case the Secretary of State had issued a warrant authorising the inter-ception of messages on the telephones of the two officers, and upon applica-tion being made that these intercepts might be used in the disciplinaryproceedings the Home Office had granted permission. But in that case the disclosure was within the public service, and cannot in any sense be saidto apply to the position which existed in the Marrinan case. We entertainedsome doubt whether the decision to use the intercepts in the police inquiryin 1953 was in fact justifiable. We are of the opinion that Viscount Tenby&apos;decision to permit the disclosure of the information contained in the tele-phone intercepts in question to the Bar Council and to the Benchers ofLincoln&apos;s Inn, was a mistaken decision.100. We are anxious not to use language which might imply that thedecision of Viscount * Tenby was unreasonable, for we quite recognise thatthe facts before Viscount Tenby, which we have summarised, were indeedhighly exceptional. The fact that the administration of justice was involvedwas the governing consideration in the mind of Viscount Tenby, and it iseasily to be understood that the importance of that consideration led him tothe conclusion that the action which he took was in all the circumstances ofthe case justifiable. But we are of opinion that the power given to theSecretary of State to issue a warrant to intercept communications, whether byletter or by telegram or by telephone, is a power of such importance andconsequence that it should be most rigorously confined to the purposes whichconvinced the Home Secretary that it was right to issue the warrant in thefirst place.101. We therefore conclude by recommending that there should be nodisclosure of the information obtained on public grounds by the exercise ofthis great power, to private individuals or private bodies or domestic tribunals of any kind whatsoever.
2253.   Use and Result102. The various authorities that use methods of interception put themto somewhat different specific uses according to the sort of crime or offencethat they are seeking to detect and suppress.103. The major uses to which methods of interception are put by theMetropolitan Police are: to break up organized and dangerous gangs; tocatch men on the run (escaped convicts and men wanted for serious crime);to detect receivers of stolen property. The reason why the overwhelming majority of warrants issued for police purposes are applied for by, and granted to, the Metropolitan Police is that London is a natural centre for criminal, as for other, activities. Much of the major crime in the provinces,even in large cities, is the work of criminals based on London. The leader of a gang cannot put his schemes into effect without direcdy or indirectlycommunicating with his henchmen, almost always by telephone. A receiverwho works on a large scale is often either the organizer or focal point of anumber of criminals who are dependent upon him for a market. A man onthe run has often revealed his whereabouts by telephone to his home or his associates.104. The use of interception by the Board of Customs and Excisestarted in 1946, that is to say, at a time when exchange control and quota restrictions induced a great increase in smuggling of a kind very damaging to the national economy. In particular, interception is used to frustrate theillicit export of capital, usually in the form of diamonds. The extent of thesmuggling of diamonds has been largely determined by the strength orweakness of sterling. It is estimated to have reached a value of  9,000,000in 1952, and is still running at a very considerable figure, probably around 6,000,000 a year. Diamond smuggling is internationally organised by avery small, closed group of people. It is hard to get reports from informersor by normal means of detection, and the smugglers normally make contactby post or telephone. Interception is also used to detect the large-scalesmuggled import of Swiss watches which adversely affects the balanceof payments, and to detect conspiracies to effect major fraudulent evasionsof purchase tax which involve the Revenue in considerable loss.105. The uses to which the Security Service puts the power to interceptare determined by the duties laid upon that Service by the Government.These are broadly to detect and counter espionage and subversion and, inthe words of Mr. Attlee (as he then was) in the House of Commons on the15th March, 1948, &quot;to ensure that no one who is known to be a memberof the Communist Party or to be associated with it in such a way as toraise legitimate doubts about his or her reliability is employed in connectionwith work, the nature of which is vital to the security of the State. Thesame rule will govern the employment of those who are known to be closely associated with Fascist organisations.&quot; This policy was confirmed by thepresent Government in March 1956, in the White Paper on the Findings ofthe Conference of Privy Councillors on Security (Cmd. 9715).106. Espionage is carried out by highly trained people who take extremeprecautions. Communications are the weakest link in their organisation, and,without penetration of these communications, it would often be impossibleto detect major espionage at all.107. Interception has not always proved an effective means of detectionor deterrence. The interception of letters did not greatly reduce the traffic in. lottery tickets, and this was one reason for the abandonment of this useof interception in 1953. But, with regard to the present day uses of inter-ception, we received conclusive evidence of their effectiveness.  We were told
-    226of many major wrong-doers who had been brought to justice, and of thefrustration of espionage. We give here only a few examples of results directlyachieved by methods of interception.1. The arrest and conviction of a number of Billy Hill&apos;s close associates.2.   The recapture of a number of escaped convicts.3. The arrest and conviction of a large-scale smuggler believed to haveillicitly exported  6.000,000 over a period of three years.4. Major spies identified; the discovery of highly secret material inpassage through the post in extremely ingenious forms, some of whichwe saw for ourselves; the detection of Communists operating secretlyin the Civil Service.108. All the authorities that use methods of interception are firmlyconvinced that the effect on their operations would be greatly, if notcalamitously, reduced if they were to be deprived of the power to interceptcommunications. The Treasury indicated to us the value that they attach to the results achieved through interceptions by the Customs and Excise.All the Secretaries of State who gave evidence before us emphasised the greateffectiveness of interception of communications as a means of detection.109. One measure of the effectiveness of interception as a means ofdetection is the number and proportion of convictions thereby obtained,which could not have been obtained by any other means. Difficulties,,however, arise in the application of this test. First, interception may be only one line of inquiry that is being followed, and it may not be easy to judge the extent to which a conviction was due to interception. Secondly,it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that a wrong-doer caught byone method of detection might not have been caught then or later by someother means. Thirdly, a number of telephone lines may be tapped in thecourse of a single investigation directed to the detection of one major offence.110. Between 1953 and 1956 the number of arrests made by, theMetropolitan Police of important and dangerous criminals as the result of direct interception was 57 per cent, of the number of telephone lines tapped.The effectiveness of interception by the Police has been getting steadilygreater, especially in the last few years. So far in 1957 every interception but-one has led to an arrest. i- 111. The number of cases of detection of major Customs frauds directly:or indirectly due to interceptions of mail and telephone lines was 80 per cent,of the number of interceptions. Another way of measuring the effectiveness of interceptions by the Customs is by the value of the seizures of illicitexports and imports. As a result of interceptions of communications between1948 and 1957, such seizures amounted to a total of  736.490. account should also be taken of the removal from the field of highly skilled operatorsand the deterrent effect upon others. The sums lost to the reserves and tothe revenues might otherwise have reached considerably greater proportions;112. The proportion that the number of arrests or convictions obtained by interception bears to the total of convictions is small. This is naturallyto be expected for the reason that in the vast majority of criminal casesthese methods of-interception are not used. They are reserved&apos; for casesof serious crime as we have explained. It was emphasised in the evidence given to us that the use of methods&apos; of interception is strictly limited to the biggest and most dangerous offenders- and that on the whole &quot;the&apos; mostimportant captures and seizures are made as the result of interception.   - :&apos;
227113. As we have pointed out in paragraphs 105 and 106. the obtaining&quot;of arrests and convictions is not necessarily a major objective of the security service. It is therefore not possible to measure the effectiveness of inter-ception as used by the Security Service by reference to arrests and convictions.The evidence we heard overwhelmingly established the following facts:  1. There are continuous organised and dangerous efforts to spy out secretsof the State.2. Similar organised and continuous efforts are made to spread subversionand to penetrate the apparatus of the Government and work of highsecurity.3. The weakest link in this highly skilled and trained chain of espionageand subversion is communication between the agents and persons concerned.4. Methods of interception are highly effective; they are often the only effective method of countering espionage and subversion and of safe-guarding the vital secrets of the State. We received a great deal of direct evidence of the success achieved solely by the interception of communications.114. We enquired closely into the number of people who have access to the information obtained by the interception of communications.115. We visited a centre where telephone tapping is operated and we ourselves held a telephone conversation that was tapped and recorded by a machine in our presence. There is a very small number of persons supervisingthis purely mechanical operation, and they listen to a tapped conversationonly occasionally and briefly to check whether the machines are in order.T16. It is at the point when the recording is passed to the authorities concerned with the use of interception that the whole content of the inter-exceptions becomes known to officials, whether it is relevant to the inquiryin hand or not, whether or not it contains private and personal or evenprivileged conversations.117. The number of officials who have access to this information is small. In no particular case of interception is the number in excess of three or four carefully chosen officers. They have the duty to select and transcribeonly those parts of the material that are relevant to the inquiry in hand. Thequantity of relevant material that is thus transcribed varies from case to case.It can be extensive but in the great majority of cases it bears a small proportion to the total material recorded by the machines. The materialthat is not selected and transcribed is destroyed.118. The selected and transcribed material necessarily becomes knownto a larger number of people, all of whom are directly concerned with an investigation. In the Police and the Customs about half a dozen officers have access to this sifted material in any particular case; in the security service only two officers. Material that is of security interest, whetherobtained by interception or from other sources, is collated in the generalrecords of the Service and may be made available to the Departments ofState who have an interest in such information.119. In our view public concern may be in some degree allayed byknowledge of the actual extent of the interception of letters and telephonemessages which has been exercised on a much smaller scale than many peopleseem to have thought. In considering the best manner of presenting the statistics, we had to weigh the consequences of any disclosure of figures at all
cp-    228upon the effectiveness of the interception of communications. All theauthorities that use the power of interception say that such disclosure would impair the effectiveness of the method as a means of detection. After very careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that it would be in thepublic interest as an exceptional measure on this occasion to publish figuresshowing the extent of the interception of communications. We recognise,however, that this should be done in a manner that does as little injury aspossible to the public interest.120. We are in particular aware of the danger of disclosing even on asingle occasion the extent of interception for security purposes. The best course therefore seems to us to group the figures for interceptions for eachof the years from 1937-56 under these heads (1) interceptions by security, Police, Customs and Post Office;(2) interceptions in connection with dangerous drugs, lotteries and obscene publications.We set out these figures in Appendix I, Table I. From this Table it appearsthat the average annual number of interceptions of telephone lines from 1937to 1956 was 130. The corresponding figure for interception of letters andtelegrams was 501.121. We are strongly of the opinion that it would be wrong for figures to be disclosed by the Secretary of State at regular or irregular intervals inthe future. It would greatly aid the operation of agencies hostile to theState if they were able to estimate even approximately the extent of theinterceptions of communications for security purposes.122. Figures for interception of communications authorised by theSecretary of State for Scotland since the war are set out in Appendix I,Table II. These figures show that in this period three warrants were issued for the interception of telephones; the average duration of these warrantswas eight weeks. One warrant was issued for the interception of one telegram.Fifty-one warrants were issued for the interception of letters in connectionwith lotteries a practice that was abandoned in 1953.123. As a result of our review of the use and result of the power to intercept communications, we are satisfied that all the officers and officials concerned are scrupulous and conscientious in the use and exercise of thepower to intercept communications. We are satisfied that interception is highly selective and that it is used only where there is good reason to believethat a serious offence or security interest is involved. We are satisfied thatthe number of people with access to material obtained by interception, either in its original or in its selected form, is kept to an absolute minimum. Weare further satisfied that interception of communications has proved very effective in the detection of major crimes, customs frauds on a large scale and serious dangers to the security of the State.4. Members of Parliament124. Questions have recently been asked in the House of Commons aboutthe propriety of intercepting the communications of Members of Parliament.We have therefore taken advice upon this matter and considered it.. Theessential point is whether the interception of a Member of Parliament^letters or telephone would constitute a breach of privilege. This is of course for the House itself to determine. So far as we have been able to discover,a Member of Parliament is not to be distinguished from an ordinary memberof the .public, so far as the interception of communications is concerned,
229unlessthe communications were held to be in connection with a Parliamentaryproceeding. On the question of the interception of Members&apos; letters theHouse of Commons expressed itself clearly in a Resolution in 1735. Thiswas reported in the Report of the Secret Committee of the House of commons of 1844 in these words:  &quot; That it is a high infringement of the privilege of the knights, citizens,and burgesses, chosen to represent the Commons of Great Britain inParliament, for any postmaster, his deputies or agents, in Great Britain orIreland, to open or look into, by any means whatsoever, any Letterdirected to or signed by the proper hand of any Member, without anexpress Warrant in writing, under the hand of one of the principalSecretaries of State, for every such opening and looking into; or to detainor delay any Letter directed to or signed with the name of any Member,unless there shall be good reason to suspect some counterfeit of it, without an express Warrant of a principal Secretary of State, as aforesaid, for every such detaining or delaying.&quot;125. This seems to be a clear recognition by the House of the rightof the Secretary of State to intercept Members&apos; postal packets by the use ofan express warrant. So far as we know this recognition has never subsequently been rescinded or modified.126. On 2nd August, 1956, Mr. Francis Noel-Baker, M.P., complained,amongst a number of other points, that his correspondence addressed toBritish subjects in the Seychelles had been interfered with. The Speakerreplied to this part of Mr. Noel-Baker&apos;s complaint in these terms:  &quot;. . . . The first complaint of the hon. Member was about theinterference with correspondence from hon. Members. The law on that subject, as I understand, is that letters can be detained and opened by a warrant of a Secretary of State. There is a long series of Acts on thissubject, the principal one being that passed in 1912. The fact that that ActWas passed by this House, and that in it there is no exception for lettersaddressed either to or from Members of Parliament, shows that there canbe no question of Privilege involved in that.&quot;127. No question seems ever to have arisen in the House on the specificquestion of the interception of a Member&apos;s telephone conversation. Subjectto any decision by the House on this point, it appears probable that therulings concerning letters - would extend by analogy to telephones.128. It is difficult to imagine the circumstances in which a telephoneconversation might be held to be related to a &quot; proceeding in Parliament&quot; a term which seems never to have been precisely defined. In 1939 the SelectCommittee on the Official Secrets Act held in its Report (Command Paper 173.1937-38, Vol. 7), that privilege protected a draft of a parliamentary questionwhich a Member showed to a Minister. This might presumably be held incertain circumstances to cover a communication in writing or by telephoneabout an intended parliamentary question. It has also been suggested thata breach of privilege might be committed if the Secretary of State wereinduced to issue a warrant for interception of a Member&apos;s telephone bysomething that that Member said in the House in relation to a Parliamentaryproceeding.5. Unauthorised Tapping129. All the evidence we heard was to the effect that there is, and hasbeen, no tapping of telephones by unauthorised persons in this country.
130. We also received evidence that, for technical reasons, theunauthorised tapping of telephones would be much more difficult in thiscountry than in the United States of America. However, there can be no certainty that unauthorised tapping of telephones does not occur and it might even be done without the commission of a trespass upon private or Crownproperty.131. In these circumstances Parliament may wish to consider whether legislation should be passed to render the unauthorised tapping of a telephoneline an offence.PART IIIHOW SHOULD THE POWER TO INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONSBE USED IN THE FUTURE?132. We are conscious that this is perhaps the most controversial questioncontained in our terms of reference and we therefore set out here the main considerations we have had in mind in answering it.133. There is no doubt that the interception of communications, whetherby the opening or reading of letters or telegrams, or by listening to andrecording telephone conversations, is regarded with general disfavour. In thiscountry where the power to detain and open letters has been in existence fromvery early times, and has been used by successive Governments for very many years, public feeling has only been aroused on rare occasions when itwas suspected or feaied that the practice was being abused in some way, in circumstances which do not warrant its use. Whether practised byunauthorised individuals or by officials purporting to act under authority, thefeeling still persists that such interceptions offend against the usual and properstandards of behaviour as being an invasion of privacy and an interferencewith the liberty of the individual in his right to be &quot; let alone when lawfullyengaged upon his own affairs.&quot; The Secret Committee of the House ofCommons in its Report in 1844 spoke of &quot;the strong moral feeling which exists against the practice of opening Letters, with its accompaniments ofmystery and concealment . . . .&quot; and Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary,said in a debate in the House of Commons in 1845 that the practice of opening letters was &quot; odious, invidious and obnoxious.&quot; It is important to observe that this dislike of interceptions is not confined to those who feel thatas a matter of principle the liberty of the individual outweighs all other considerations, or that the exercise of the power is not justified by the results obtained; it is also shared by those who think it right that the power to intercept communications should be used by the State, under proper safeguards, for well-defined purposes. We think it important to emphasisethis aversion to the interception of communications, for just as the wiseadministration of the criminal law must depend finally upon the support and approval of public opinion, so the principles by which the law is enforcedmust win the same approval if they are to be exercised effectively and withoutpublic unrest. The disquiet expressed by Members of the House of Commonswhich resulted in the setting up of the present Inquiry was due, we think, insome measure at least, to the dislike of obtaining information by means oftapping telephone wires, quite apart from the separate questions of the propriety of opening letters, or the extent of the practice of intercepting letters and telephone conversations, or of the value of the information obtained, or ofthe use that had been made of the information so acquired.   In considering
231the questions contained in our terms of reference, therefore, we have reminded,ourselves at all times that the liberty of the subject was involved, and thatthere was considerable opposition to any use of methods of interceptingcommunications for any purpose, public or private.134. In framing our recommendations as to the future use of any powersof intercepting communications, it was necessary for us to understand andappreciate, as far as we were able to do so, the grounds of the antipathy tothe methods of interception of communications in general. It is impossible,of course, to do more than to speculate upon the attitude of the public at large, but there is reason to suppose that some of the objections at least canbe thus stated:  (i) The powers of interception are in the hands of State officials. Theyare exercised in secret, and the extent of the exercise and the purposes for which the powers are exercised are not publicly known.(ii) There is some apprehension that the powers may be used to invadeprivate rights, and to interfere with the liberty of the subjectunnecessarily.(iii) The circumstances in which the powers may be exercised do not give to the subject any reasonable opportunities for protest or objection.135. The greatest agitation which ever arose upon the question ofdetaining and opening letters was in 1844, when Sir James Graham, theSecretary of State, had opened the letters of Joseph Mazzini and had communicated some of their contents to the Neapolitan Government. InParker&apos;s &quot; Life and Letters of Sir James Graham,&quot; a detailed account is given of that great controversy, and it is quite clear that the feeling was based, insome measure, on the suspicion that the practice of opening letters was verywidespread and that the letters of the ordinary citizen were not immune. Inthe Greville Memoirs, Vol. V, at p. 182, there are certain interesting references to this agitation, and Greville states that &quot;it lit up a flame throughout thecountry. Every foolish person who used papers and pens fancied theirnonsense was read at the Home Office.&quot;136. We have referred in paragraph 11 of this Report to the terms ofreference of the two Secret Committees, and it is interesting to notice that,when the reports of those two Committees were made known, and the specialcircumstances in which the power was exercised were made plain, the publicanger at once subsided. According to Greville, who was a close observer ofthe parliamentary scene, when the Member who had raised the originalQuestion moved that a Select Committee should inquire into the opening ofhis own letters in February, 1845, &quot; the House was tired of the subject and the motion was defeated.&quot; So in the present inquiry we cannot but feel thatsome of the antipathy to the methods employed, particularly those of tappingtelephone wires, is due to the fear, or the suspicion, or the belief that it ispractised on a large scale, and that the telephones of ordinary citizens arelikely to be the subject of such interference, or could possibly be the subject ofsuch interference. Some Questions which were asked in the House ofCommons would seem to lend colour to this view. It is important, therefore,that it should be made as widely known; as considerations of public policypermit, that the power of intercepting communications is very strictly reservedfor the very special cases where the public interest is deeply involved to whichwe have referred in detail in another part of this Report.137. We have examined the exact circumstances in which the powers ofthe Secretary of State have been exercised, in order to see what is the extentof the interference with the privacy of the individual or his liberty, and whether
such interference ought to be prohibited for the future, or whether it isnecessary or justifiable in the interests of the citizens as a whole that theprocedure in force at the present time should continue. The freedom of theindividual is quite valueless if he can be made the victim of the law breaker.Every civilised society must have power to protect itself from wrongdoers.It must have powers to arrest, search and imprison those who break the laws.If these powers are properly and wisely exercised, it may be thought that theyare in themselves aids to the maintenance of the true freedom of the individual.It is therefore most important to observe that from the evidence tendered tous, it is plain that the exercise of the power to intercept communications bythe Secretary of State has never been regarded as a general power, but as a power, carefully restricted to special and well-defined circumstances and purposes, and hedged about with clearly formulated rules and subject to very special safeguards.138. In the Report of the Secret Committee of the House of Lords of1844, appointed to inquire into the state of the law in respect of the detainingand opening of letters by the Post Office, and into the mode under whichauthority given for such opening and detaining has been exercised, and toreport their opinion and observations thereupon to the House, there is onepassage which seems to us to be applicable to the evidence we ourselveshave heard &quot; The Committee are bound, in conclusion, to state, that having lookedback to the Proceedings of several Secretaries of State during successiveAdministrations over more than Twenty Years, they have found thePractice has been nearly uniform, that the Power has been very sparinglyexercised, and never from personal or Party Motives, and that in every case investigated it seems to have been directed by an earnest and faithfulDesire to adopt that Course which appeared to be necessary, either topromote the Ends of Justice or to prevent a Disturbance of the publicTranquility, or otherwise to promote the best Interests of the Country.&quot;The Committee of 1844 said that they left it to the legislature to determine whether the power should continue to exist, and it is interesting to note thatthe power has continued to exist without any interruption and has continuedto be recognised by the statutes.139. We have set out in paragraphs 57 et seq of our Report the pro-cedure which is followed by the Secretary of State before the issue of anywarrant and we have been very much influenced in our conclusions by thenature of that procedure. In the light of evidence given before us we aresatisfied that if the practice of issuing warrants is to continue for the purposeswe have specified, apart from the suggestions we make in the body of our report, no further safeguards are needed to see that the power is properlyand wisely executed; for in our opinion the best possible safeguard lies in thefinal responsibility of the Secretary of State. All the Secretaries of State for theHome Department who have held office since the beginning of the war were of the same opinion that the power to intercept communications should stillbe permitted under the conditions and safeguards which have existed in thepast; further that they were all of opinion from their very intimate knowledgeof the procedure that there had been no case where the liberty of the subject had been invaded to his detriment. This very powerful testimony seemed tous of the highest importance. It is true that they were all men who hadexercised authority in the highest positions of the State, and who werenaturally concerned with the efficiency of methods of government, but just as the Secret Committee of the House of Lords of 1844 were impressed bythe witnesses who had held high office, we too in our turn, were impressed
-    233by this unanimity of opinion. The Secret Committee of the House of Lor4sof 1844 reported &quot;it is the concurrent Opinion of Witnesses who have heldhigh Office, and who may be most competent to form a sound Judgment,that .they would reluctantly see this Power abolished . . .&quot; We repeat thissentence as representing the views of the Secretaries of State who have been good enough to give evidence before us.140.   The Secret Committee of the House of Lords of 1844 also reported and we think that their finding is applicable to present conditions &quot; They think that the Responsibility will be more effective when restingupon the Individuals who are mainly charged with the Preservation ofPeace and the Prevention of Crime in this Country than if it were dividedwith others . . .&quot;We considered whether it would be an advantage to require all applicationsto the Secretary of State for the issue of his warrant to be made on oath but when it is remembered that the applications from the Security Service andthe Police are made only after the rigorous examinations we have described in Part II of our Report, and that the applications, when made, are made only by the very highest officials of the two Departments, we do not feel that any additional security or advantage is to be gained by requiring the applicationsto be made on oath though Mr. Gordon Walker is of a contrary opinion ashis Note discloses.141. In the first great field where the power has been and is exercised that of national security we feel no doubt at all in recommending that thepowers of interception should continue to be used subject to the conditions and safeguards which we have set out at length in Part II and in the summaryof conclusions. The Security Service is part of the defence system of thecountry, and its supreme task is the defence of the Realm, and this necessarilyinvolves protection from espionage, from sabotage, and indeed from every kind of action that threatens the security of the State. It is upon the securityof the State that the citizens rely for the enjoyment of their freedom, and itwould be folly to hamper or hinder the Security Service by withdrawingessential powers from them unless the necessity to do so were quite over-whelming. It is important to note that it is no general power that is exercised.,but one limited expressly to the cases where there is reasonable cause tobelieve that subversive activities are already being carried on. We are quite satisfied that the problems of national security are such that no reasonableWeapon should be taken from the hands of those whose duty it is to watchover all subversive activities in the safeguarding of British interests. We arefurther satisfied, from the evidence before us, that the methods of interceptionhitherto employed are necessary, and have been productive of importantresults which could not have been obtained in any other way.142. We now consider the exercise of the power by the Secretary of state in cases of serious crime, which is the second great field of activity. &apos; Thedetection and suppression of crime is essential to the good government of anysociety, but it is not so fundamental as the security of the State itself. other methods are available for the detection of crime, and, even if some criminalsdo escape detection, the injury to the State cannot compare with the kind of injury the Security Service seeks to prevent. If, therefore, it could be shownthat this method of intercepting communications, either by letter or by tele-gram or by telephone conversation, affected the law-abiding citizen to hisdetriment, even though the power was being exercised to prevent and detectcrime, we should have hesitated to recommend that the power of interceptionshould continue to be exercised for this purpose. But so far from the citizenbeing injured by the exercise of the power in the circumstances we have set
put, we think the citizen benefits therefrom. The adjustment between therights of the individual and the rights of the community must depend uponthe needs and conditions which exist at any given moment, and we do,notthink that there is any real conflict between the rights of the individual citizenand the exercise of this power to intercept by the Secretary of State in the limited circumstances which we have set out in Part II of this P^eport. Theissue of warrants by the Secretary of State in these well-defined circumstancesis exercised with the avowed intention of detecting and preventing crime, andof thus securing those conditions which will permit the freedom of theindividual to be unimpeded, and make his liberty an effective, as distinct from a nominal, liberty.143. It is to be noted that no warrant is even applied for unless a crimeof a serious nature has been committed and is actually under investigation,and other methods of investigation have either been tried and have failed, ormust from the nature of the case be unlikely to succeed if they were tried;so that there is no likelihood of the ordinary law-abiding citizen being affectedto his detriment by this procedure. The evidence before us showed that thePolice do not seek to use methods of interception save in the very special cases of serious crimes to which they are specially applicable arid which inpractice have proved most useful and efficacious. The nature of the seriouscrime was disclosed to us, and specific instances of serious crimes were given.These crimes were described as &quot;those organised and carried out by pro-fessional criminals who want to make a great deal of money and would n6tthink of making it in any other way than by crime, at the expense of their fellow citizens.&quot;144. We cannot think it to be wise or prudent or necessary to take away from the Police any weapon or to weaken any power they now possess in theirfight against organised crime of this character. The Police ought not to behandicapped in their efforts to prevent or to detect crime, whilst the criminalis allowed to use every modern method to achieve his purpose. If it be saidthat the number of cases where methods of interception are used is small,and that an objectionable method could therefore well be abolished, we feelthat though the number of cases may be small this is not a reason whycriminals in this particular class of crime should be encouraged by ,theknowledge that they have nothing to fear from methods of interception. Wetherefore think that no useful purpose would be served by recommending that the power of interception be no longer exercised in the detection andprevention of crime, for it would remove from the hands of the Police a weapon which they have found to be effective when all other methods havebeen unavailing, and would announce to potential wrong-doers that they have nothing to fear from the Police in this particular respect. This, in our opinion,so far from strengthening the liberty of the ordinary citizen, might very &apos;well have the opposite effect.145. The Secret Committee of the House of Commons reporting in 1844said on this point &quot; It must also be remembered that if such a power as this were formally abolished, the question would not be left quite in the samecondition as though the power had never been exercised or disputed; bywithdrawing it, every criminal and conspirator against the public peace wouldbe publicly assured that he could enjoy secure possession of the easiest,cheapest, and most unobserved channel of communication, and that theSecretary of State would not under any circumstances interfere with hiscorrespondence. It must not be forgotten, however, that at present otherrapid means of communicating their views are of easy access to the. evilintentioned, and that, as far as internal order is concerned, the same rapidmeans afford the Government unexampled facilities for suppressing tumult.&quot;
-    235146. The foregoing observations are intended to apply to all the activitiesof the Police as we have set them out, and also to the activities of the officials of the Board of Customs and Excise.147. It is important to remember at all times that the power to openletters has been exercised in this country for many hundreds of years, and that power has been the subject of debate in Parliament on several occasions.148. We have referred to the year 1844, when the two Secret committees were set up, but long before that date the practice of intercepting letters hadbeen exercised and had been made publicly known. The details are fullyset out in the Report of the Secret Committee of the House of Commons in1844. The Reports of the Secret Committees of both Houses of parliament in 1844 contain a wealth of historical information which we have found tobe of the greatest service to us in our work. The Report of the Committeeof the House of Commons is particularly valuable for the documents whichare set out in full, for the extracts from the Lords and Commons Journals,from the Reports of the Council of State and for the references to the StateTrials, and other sources of information. We do not think it necessary toproduce much of this material in our Report but it is available for reference.In 1735, a complaint being made in the House of Commons by certain of theMembers that their letters had been opened and read by the clerks of thePost Office on the pretence of ascertaining whether or not the franks of those members were counterfeit, the matter was referred to the consideration of aCommittee to make a Report to the House, and upon the Committee doing so the House passed the Resolution, which we have set out in paragraph 124 ofPart II of this Report, which recognised the authority of the Secretary of state to issue warrants to intercept communications.149. Parliament therefore with the knowledge of the method of inter-intercepting letters had permitted it to continue for this great length of time andthere has been no view so far as we know adverse to the method expressedin the Courts of law. On the contrary letters so detained and opened havebeen used, though rarely, in cases coming before the Courts. In the years1722-3 in the course of the proceedings on passing the Bills of Pains and penalties against Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, and his two associates,Kelly and Plunket, the principal evidence adduced against the parties accusedwas that of Post Office clerks and others who, in obedience to warrants fromthe Secretary of State had detained, opened, copied and deciphered letters toor from those parties. In the Committee on the Bill against the Bishop in theHouse of Lords the clause of the Statute of Anne was referred to andcommented on by the Bishop&apos;s Counsel, Mr. Wynne State Trials, Vol. 16,page 544, and doubt was raised whether the copying of a letter was sanctionedby the Act of Anne; but in no one of these three cases was any question raised as to the legality of the warrants. In the year 1758, Dr. Hensey, aphysician, was tried on a charge of high treason, being accused of treasonablecorrespondence with the enemy. The principal evidence on which he wasconvicted was that of a letter carrier and a Post Office, clerk, the latter ofwhom had opened Dr. Hensey&apos;s letters and delivered them to the Secretaryof State. In the trial of Home Tooke for High Treason in 1795, State TrialsVol. 25, a letter written to Home Tooke by the printer was intercepted atthe Post Office and was stated by Home Tooke to be the immediate occasion of his apprehension. On his requiring its production, it was produced inCourt by the Crown Officers and was given in evidence. In 1923 at the trial before Mr. Justice Swift of Art 0&apos;Brien and others for seditiousconspiracy, a number of original letters intercepted in the post were produced
in evidenced In his summing up to the jury the learned judge said &quot; it wasno doubt a matter of surprise to the jury to learn of the mass of corresrpondence passing between London and Dublin and of relief to know that theauthorities in this country were not so blind or stupid as they were sometimesthought to be and that they knew a little more of what was going on thanthose who did these things either suspected or imagined. . . . It is well forthis country that there is an organisation -when it is suspected that a crime isabout to be perpetrated which has a means of watching the suspectedpersons.&quot;150. We feel that to announce the abandonment of this power now would be a concession to those who are desirous of breaking the law in one form or another, with no advantage to the ordinary citizen or to the community in general. If the Police were to be deprived of the power to tap telephonewires in cases of serious crime, the criminal class would be given the useof the elaborate system set up by the State and use it to conspire and plotfor criminal purposes to the great injury of the law-abiding citizen. the telephone could then be used with impunity to arrange the last-minute details,for example, of a mail van robbery, a theft on an organised scale, an assaultwith robbery on a citizen, or indeed any form of crime. In the large centres of population like London it would be an immensely powerful aid to criminalconspiracies of every kind if it were made known that the power to intercepttelephone communications had been prohibited, and it would permit the telephone system to be used without hindrance by the criminal classes andaid them in their criminal enterprises without any advantage either to theindividual or to the State. Thus, in the view we take, if the power ofintercepting telephone conversations were to be taken away from the Police,the law-abiding citizen would get nothing in return, and might indeed sufferthe greatest loss.151. Two objections can be dealt with shortly. If it should be said thatat least the citizen would have the assurance that his own telephone would notbe tapped, this would be of little comfort to him, because if the powers of thePolice are allowed to be exercised in the future, as they have been in the pastunder the safeguards we have set out, the telephone of the ordinary law-abiding citizen would be quite immune, as it always has been. Secondly, ifit is said that when the telephone wires of a suspected criminal are tapped allmessages to him, innocent or otherwise, are necessarily intercepted too, itshould be remembered that this is really no hardship at all to the innocentcitizen. The information so obtained goes only to the Police and, until therecent case affecting Mr. Marrinan, had never been disclosed to any outsideperson and had always been destroyed. This cannot properly be described asan interference with liberty; it is an inevitable consequence of tapping the telephone of the criminal; but it has no harmful results, and the testimonyof the Secretaries of State who have given evidence before us confirms thisview. The citizen must endure this inevitable consequence in order that themain purpose of detecting and preventing crime should be achieved. - Wecannot think, in any event, that the fact that innocent messages may beintercepted is any ground for depriving the Police of a very powerful weaponin their fight against crime and criminals. No single ground of complaintunder this head has been made known to us, and we feel the question we are asked to answer should be answered in the light of practical reality, ratherthan in imagined or fanciful circumstances. To abandon the power now would be a concession to those who are desirous of breaking the law in one form or another, without any advantage to the community whatever.* The Times Newspaper, 5th July, 1923.35
237152. With regard to the use to be made of the information discovered:we feel that that should be confined to the authority empowered by. the warrant to discover it, and it should not be disclosed to private persons orto private bodies. It should be recognised that this is a very great and responsible power confided to the executive exclusively for State purposes,and we feel that it should be so confined. We are told that in practice theHome Office insists that the power should be exercised for the purpose ofdetection only, primarily on the ground that the use of the information so obtained, if used in Court, would make the practice widely known and thusdestroy its efficacy in some degree. But we do not feel for ourselves thatwe need argue the wisdom or otherwise of this practice, although we see noreason why in a proper case the evidence should not be tendered, for when theoccasion arises the admissibility of the evidence will be decided by a Courtbefore whom the evidence is tendered, and the history of the law of evidence is proof enough of the immense care that is taken in the administration ofjustice to see that the evidence submitted both in civil and criminal cases is evidence that it is proper to admit in all the circumstances of the case. Itshould be noted that the limitations which have been placed by the courts and by the judges upon the powers of the Police have at all times been forthe protection of the citizen, and the important question has always beenthe quality of the evidence in the proceedings actually before the Court,and how far that evidence tends to serve the true purpose of justice. Wethink, therefore, that the practice of applying for the warrants of theSecretary of State in the special circumstances we have set out, and theprocedure under which such warrants are granted, should be permitted tocontinue, but that there should be no relaxation of the rigid conditions andsafeguards which have proved of such value in practice, and that there shouldbe no extension of these powers beyond those we have so carefully defined.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS153. We consider that the decision of the then Secretary of State to maketranscripts of intercepted telephone conversations available to the Bar Counciland the Benchers of Lincoln&apos;s Inn was a mistaken decision.   (Paragraph 99.)154. We recommend that in no circumstances should material obtained by. interception be made available to any body or person whatever outsidethe public service.   (Paragraphs 100 and 101.)155. We are satisfied that Secretaries of State and all the officials concerned have taken, and continue to take, scrupulous care to ensure the strict observance of the purposes to which it is intended by the Home office that j the interception of communications should be directed and confined.(Paragraph 90.)156. ; We are satisfied that interception is highly selective and that it is used only where there is good reason to believe that a serious offence orsecurity interest is involved.   (Paragraphs 64-70.) ..157. We are satisfied that only the minimum number of people have access to intercepted material either in its original or in its selected form andthat this number is&apos;very small.   (Paragraphs 115-118.) &apos; &apos; 1158. We are satisfied that interception has proved effective in thedetection of major crimes, customs frauds and dangers to the security of theState.   (Paragraphs 107-113.)
. 159. We recommend that there should be a regular review of outstandingwarrants not less than once a month both by the Home Office and by everyauthority that is granted a warrant to intercept.   (Paragraph 74.)160. We recommend that warrants should no longer be valid until theyare cancelled, but that their validity should be for a denned period thatappears on their face.   (Paragraph 75.)161. We recommend that the cancellation of a warrant by the authorityto whom it was issued should be forthwith reported to the Home Office.(Paragraph 76.)162. We recommend that in future each warrant issued by the Secretaryof State should specify the particulars that we have set out.  (Paragraph 56.)163. We recommend that full records showing the details we have setout should be kept in the Home Office in each case of interception.(Paragraph 84.)164. We recommend that the power to intercept letters at the requestof the sender should continue to be exercised in cases where a clear publicinterest is involved.  (Paragraphs 87-89.)165. It would be against the public interest for the Secretary of state to give figures of the extent of the interception in communications, for thereasons set out.   (Paragraphs 119-121.)166. So far as we can determine, a Member of Parliament is in exactly the same position as any private citizen in regard to the interception of his communications unless those communications were held to be connected witha proceeding in Parliament.  (Paragraphs 124-128.)167. It is for Parliament to consider whether legislation should beintroduced to make the unauthorised tapping of a telephone line an offence.(Paragraphs 129-131.)168. We recommend that the powers of interception should continueto be used subject to the conditions and safeguards we have set out in Part iii and in this summary of conclusions, but that there should be no extensionbeyond those we have so carefully defined. (Paragraphs 139-152.)Mr. Gordon Walker has reservations on this recommendation-as set out below.169. We cannot conclude without placing on record our recognition ofthe very efficient work of our Secretary, Mr. G. A. Peacock. This is noconventional acknowledgment. We are conscious that we laid on him a very heavy burden of work which he has discharged with great ability. Inparticular, his assistance in compiling the statistics and checking all questionsof fact has been quite invaluable, and his help at every stage of the work has greatly assisted us in our task.NORMAN BIRKETT.MONCKTON OF BRENCHLEY.P.

23RESERVATION BY MR. P. C. GORDON WALKER170. Whereas I concur in the other main conclusions andrecommendations in our Report, I regret that I cannot wholly agree with my colleagues in their conclusion that the present use of the power to intercept communications should continue unchanged. In my view thepurposes for which warrants are issued should in future be judged by new and stricter standards, particularly in regard to the detection of crime: withthe effect that interception would practically cease to be used for thispurpose.171. I feel that this would be in closer accord with our general ideasin this country about the methods that we permit the Police to use and withthe state of public opinion concerning the interception of communications.We are proud in Britain that our rules of evidence are more favourable to the accused than in some other countries, and that an innocent man shouldnot be wrongly convicted, although this may result in some guilty personsescaping punishment. Although the Police may put any question to anarrested or suspected person, the Judges&apos; Rules prescribe and limit the answers that the Police may tender as evidence.172. The reason why we enforce such high standards and tie the handsof the Police in certain respects is that this aids the enforcement of law andorder; for the methods used by the Police must carry public support. Inmy opinion public concern about telephone tapping is such that if the interception of communications for the detection of crime continues as inthe past there may be some danger of a weakening of the popular approvalwithout which the Police cannot in the long run carry on effectively.173. A restriction of the purposes for which the interception of communications is used in the detection of crime would be in accord withthe general trend of policy since the war. One of the factors determining the evolution of policy in regard to the interception of communications hasbeen the state of public opinion towards the exercise of this power. As werecord in our Report, the interception of letters to prevent the transmission of illegal lottery material was abandoned in November 1953; shortly afterwardsthe interception of letters believed to contain obscene matter was similarlydiscontinued. In my view the interception of communications should never have been used for either of these purposes; neither of the illegal actionsaimed at can be regarded as a crime serious enough to justify the exerciseby the State of so great and exceptional a power. One of the reasons for theabandonment of interception in these two cases was (we were told) a changein public opinion towards the offence in question and a growing reluctance to use interception for the purpose in question. (See paragraph 59.) In1951 the Home Office in letters to the Metropolitian Police and Customs laiddown more stringent and precise conditions governing the grant of warrants.(Paragraph 64.)174. Public repugnance to the interception of communications has, itseems to me, increased and there should therefore be a further restrictionupon the use of this power for the purposes of the detection of crime. Infuture the interception of communications should, in my submission, nolonger be regarded as an admissible method of detection in what may becalled ordinary cases of crime, even when these are &quot; serious &quot; as this termhas been defined by the Home Office; but should be authorised only whenthe Secretary of State is satisfied that there is the most extreme and urgentreason. The sort of rare and exceptional case I have in mind is that a dangerous criminal or lunatic is at large who is likely to commit violence
or murder and the interception of communications may provide the best or only means of his speedy recapture; or that a highly organised and dangerousgang is committing violence and cannot be broken up by other means ofdetection. The application of these new and much stricter standards of judgment by the Secretary of State should, I suggest, be such that the interception of communications for the detection of^crime would in practicecease to be used for long periods of time. It would be a power held in reserve for unusual and extraordinary cases of the utmost urgency, in whichthere could be no doubt that the use of the power would carry overwhelmingpublic support.175. There would, of course, be a price to pay if my recommendationwere adopted. It would, bring comfort to some criminals and smugglers. Theprice can, however, be exaggerated. It is true, as we make clear inparagraph 112 of our Report, that methods of interception are used onlyin a small number of serious cases. Nevertheless the proportion that thenumber of arrests or convictions obtained by interception bears to the totalof arrests or convictions seems to me significant. I have taken out figuresfor certain recent years. The number of detections of offenders securedthrough interception by the Customs was 07 per cent, of the total numberof convictions for offences against customs regulations. The number ofarrests made by the Metropolitan Police as the result of interceptions was0-13 per cent, of the total number of arrests for indictable offences. Thesefigures seem to me to suggest that, even if the interception of communicationsfor the detection of crime were practically brought to an end, there wouldbe no catastrophic increase in the amount of crime that might in consequenceescape detection. Moreover, it is scarcely to be doubted that most of theoffenders would be caught, if not so prompdy, by normal means of detection.It must also be taken into account that the danger would be reduced that thepublic repugnance to telephone tapping may weaken popular support and approval of the methods used by the Police.176. A distinction must in my view be drawn between the interception of communications for the detection of crime and for security purposes. as my colleagues point out, &quot; even if some criminals do escape justice the injury to the State cannot compare with the kind of injury the Security Serviceseeks to prevent.&quot; A far larger proportion of the information that theSecurity Service must discover is obtained by interception of communicationthan in the case of the Police or the Customs. A great deal of this vitalinformation could be discovered by no other means. There cannot, therefore,in my view be the same sharp restriction of the use of the interception of communications by the Security Service as I recommend in regard to theuse of this power for the detection of crime.177. Even in the field of security the strictest possible limits should beset to the use of the power to intercept communications. It should in my view be allowed for two purposes only: -(1) direct counter-espionage and protection of high secrets of State;(2) the prevention of the employment of Fascists or Communists inconnection with work, the nature of which is vital to the State.It is fair to state that these are the two purposes for which the Security service at present mainly intercepts communications.178. In addition to the detailed suggestions and recommendations contained in our report, I would like to propose that no warrant to authorisethe interception of communications should be issued by the Secretary of
State save on a sworn information or affidavit. This would impart an element of formality and precision that seems to me appropriate to the exercise of so great and exceptional a power.179. I also propose that no material obtained by the interception of communications should be used by the Crown as evidence in any Courtof Law or in any Inquiry in the public service. This seems to me to accord with public feeling about the use of evidence that is necessarily obtained byfurtive means and normally consists only of selected extracts from the communications that have been intercepted.P. C. GORDON WALKER.

APPENDIX 11Authorities that Intercepted Communications between 1937 and 1956I. The Ministry of Food was granted, between 1941 and 1944, warrantsto intercept thirty-one telephone lines and five warrants to intercept letters.2. The Treasury was, in 1939, granted a warrant to tap one telephoneline.3. One warrant was issued in 1952 to the Crown Office in Scotland to intercept telegrams in connection with a case of culpable homicide. &apos;4. The Investigation Branch of the Post Office has on a relatively small number of occasions been granted warrants in connection with the detectionof such crimes as large-scale mail-van robberies and persistent attacks onsafes on Post Office premises.5. The Port of London Authority Police was granted in 1952 onewarrant to tap two telephone lines.6. Chief Constables were granted warrants to tap fourteen telephonelines and six warrants for the interception of letters.7. At the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions a warrant was issued in 1937 for the interception of letters. In the following year aparticular letter and telegram were intercepted at the request of a chief constable so that they could be shown to the Director of Public Prosecutions.8. In 1944 a warrant was issued to the City of London Police for the interception of letters.9. There was one example of interception in 1944 which it is not easy to classify. One of Her Majesty&apos;s Judges of Assize made an order instructingthe Post Office to pass to the Police the correspondence of a woman convicted of false pretences. The Secretary of State issued a warrant to regularisethe matter.10. The Home Office (for dangerous drugs, lotteries and obscene publications).II. The Metropolitan Police.12.
