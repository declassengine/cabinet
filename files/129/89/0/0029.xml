C.(57) 229 copy NO. So11th October, 1957CABINETEDUCATION:   CAPITAL expenditure memorandum by the Minister of education the Cabinet decided last month that investment in the public sector in 1958/59 and 1959/60 should be restricted to the 1957/58 level(C. C. (57) 68th Conclusions, Minute 3).    Educational investment should certainly be cut so as to restrict it during the relevant years to thelevel of 1957/58:  but I think it is a matter for serious consideration whether we should do more than this.2.        In saying this I have in mind our announced policies, thecontinued increase in the number of children and the basic importanceof improving our scientific and technical education.    I fear that a cut in educational investment which is more severe than that on the public sector as a whole, coming on top of the decision to proceed with thegeneral grant, will revive all the doubts about the sincerity of theConservative Party with regard to education that were so widespreadduring the years immediately after 1951.    Even levelling off will involvea highly unpopular return to rationing of &quot;minor projects&quot; and holding up some projects for rural reorganisation.3.        If it is considered essential to go further than levelling off, Iwould suggest a temporary embargo on starting new rural secondary schools needed for eliminating all-age schools in the villages;  and a drastic cut in expenditure on &quot;minor works&quot;.    (These are jobs costingless than  10,000 each, many of which are for the improvement of badconditions in old schools.)4.        This would make possible a cut of  11 millions in planned invest-ment over the two years 1958/60, as compared with a cut of  8 millions which would be needed merely to restrict investment to the 1957/58 level.5.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer however has asked me, overthe same two years, to make a cut of  20 millions.    In addition to themeasures listed in paragraph 3 this would mean delaying the programme for technical education and also cutting the minimum programme of school places needed for the growing number of children and for new housing areas.     I cannot believe that, in the light of the Red Moon, any interference with technical education would make political sense.    a cut in the main school building programme would mean that essentialschool places would simply not be ready in time.    And the fact thatwe were contemplating this result would be immediately apparent.-1-SECRETv SECRETf(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT j
6.        I could not recommend the adoption of either of these measures.I realise that our prime objectives are to stem inflation and to save the pound, and that all our economic policies must be directed to these ends.Yet I cannot persuade myself - and I am sure we shall not be able to persuade others - that the security of our currency cannot be attainedwithout delaying the technical education programme or having childrenout of school.G.L.Ministry of Education, W.I.Uth October, 1957.-2-SECRET
