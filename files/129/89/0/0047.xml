REPORT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE for commonwealth RELATIONS ON HIS VISIT TO THEFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND INOCTOBER, 1957Since Federation was established in 1953, the economic progress inthe three territories has been spectacular.    The expansion of Salisbury,where the European population in 1951 was 40,000 and in 1956 was 62,000,is equalled in most of the larger towns and everywhere boom conditionsprevail.    No doubt much development would have taken place withoutFederation, but a great and well-founded surge of confidence followed theAct, capital was attracted on a large scale, and industrial expansion wasand remains rapid.2.      With cheap power from Kariba which will be available for theCopperbelt in I960,   with African labour abundant and inexpensive, withcopper (even at its present reduced price) a major revenue earner, withan expanding steel production based on accessible ore, with a variety ofother minerals, including large coal reserves and improving tobaccp and agricultural production, the future prosperity of the Federation seemssecure.3.      Though, with external capital in short supply and reductions in therevenue from copper, the present pace of development can scarcely bemaintained, it should nevertheless continue steadily.4.      Nyasaland is the weakest partner and it is there that the economic advantages of Federation can most clearly be seen.    The average annualnet inflow of capital into the Protectorate has increased since beforeFederation from about  ^ million to over  2^ millions, and the average annual earnings of Africans employed in Nyasaland have increased by44 per cent since Federation, compared with an increase of 32 per cent for the whole Federal area.    In general the economic case for Federationis unchallengeable.     The economy is expanding and the African is getting a fair share of the benefits.    Considering his lack of knowledge and ;capacity ten years ago, industry is certainly providing the African with aland of opportunity.5.      Politically there is heavier weather ahead.    The Africans in thethree Territories combined out-number the Europeans by 30 to 1, whilethe Europeans hold all the wealth and all the political power.    In thefuture development of the country each is indispensable to the other buteach is afraid of the &quot;partnership&quot; which is declared to be the social andpolitical goal of Federation.6.     The African fears that the European will use his experience,wealth and privilege to maintain power for ever and to exclude him from political responsibility.    The European fears that, if the African is admitted to political influence, he will use his weight of numbers to oustthe European from the country for which he has done everything and where he considers he lives as of right.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
7.      Among the Europeans there are n. number who treat the Africanbadly and dismiss the possibility that he could qualify for responsibility in any foreseeable future;  among the Africans there are those who havecaught the infection of racialism from overseas and are creating atension between the races which is not yet serious but is noticeable and cannot be ignored.     There is evidence that the colour bar is beginning to break down but it is very slow;  most of the hotels, cinemas, barbersshops and buses bar Africans and Asians and as more Africans becomeeducated these practices hurt increasingly and are resented.8.      Industry is breaching this kind of segregation and joint educationwill slowly do the same.    Contact between the races will spread down from the University through the technical colleges and eventually throughthe secondary schools, but for the present the daily practice of the colourbar leads to open disbelief among the Africans that partnership will bea reality.    It is a gift to the African National Congress politicians andmakes it easier for them to represent that the European settlers, if ieftto their own devices, will convert the Federation into another South Africa.Among Europeans there is a conflict of view as to the pace at whichAfricans should be allowed to progress.    There are those who think thatthe pace has lately been dangerously fast and who, if they would not calla halt, would proceed with extreme caution.    They are represented by theDominion Party (who are skid to lean towards South Africa&apos;s policy) andI think by a substantial rriajority of the Federal Party, including most ofthe Federal Ministers.    They have in their support the incontrovertibleargument that the African, who only fifty years ago was no more than asavage, is still, despite much progress, extremely backward.    There areonly a handful among the whole population up to a University degreestandard and the rest are nowhere.    There is a minority of Europeanswhich is probably becoming more influential, who believe that a &quot;goslow1will be fatal to the chances of winning African co-operation and who wouldtake the deliberate risk of a more liberal policy.    They claim thatdecisive liberal leadership would win the moderate African&apos;s support forpartnership and that now is the time.    They argue in particular that theFederal Government could do more to give a lead, for example by breakingdown barriers to the employment of Africans on the railways and in thehigher Civil Service.9.     These conflicting views have come to the front in argument anddebate about the Federal Governments franchise proposals.    I am circulating a separate paper (C.(57) 248) on this particular problem, but one thing is common to all proposals which have been put forward by any section of Europeans, &quot;die-hard&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot;.    All, by one device or another secure that the African can only exercise a minute influence in theTerritorial Parliaments or in the Federal Parliament for many years ahead.    Differences between Europeans are confined within very narrowmargins of concessions and I doubt if the Africans are interested in theliberalising niceties which exercise the minds of the Europeans.    Theytend to see things in extremer terms 9-nd direct their minds to thoughts of adult suffrage and African majorities.    The moderates realise thatthey cannot get such prizes yet but keep them as their ultimateobjectives.10.    The African has no political organisation, unless Congress      iestablishes itself.    Congress is blatantly racial and therefore opposedto the Federal Government which it represents to the people as being-2-CONFIDENTIAL
dominated by Europeans who, given half a chance, would impose the SouthAfrican pattern upon them.    For the moment it suits Congress in nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia to have only one political target, but,should they ever overthrow Federation, they would certainly then turntheir fire on the Government of the United Kingdom, as their goal is&quot;Africa for the Africans&quot;.    Congress is not at present making much progress, but it is organised in &quot;action groups&quot; and could be dangerous.11.     Political ambitions and fears are also focused upon *dominion status&apos; for the Federation.    By and large the Europeans would like it,partly for reasons of prestige,, partly because they genuinely feel theyare adult enough to run the three Territories without the Colonial Officeand British Government administering such a large slice of their affairs and partly because they specifically want to get direct control of the handling of African affairs.    They argue that, so long as an African canappeal to a third party, he will never give his loyalty to the Federation.They also see Ghana completely independent within the Commonwealth andare impatient with the British Government for not pressing on with plans to give the Federation full Commonwealth status.    It is a politicalrallying point for all sections of European opinion and will increasinglyfeature in election programmes and pledges.1Z.     On the other hand the prospect of Dominion status upsets the africans and is causing much of their present apprehension.    They believe,especially in the two Northern Territories, that it is a device that will allow a Federal Government, largely composed of Southern RhodesianEuropeans, to establish a South African system, with Dominion status.They argue that they will lose the protection of the British Government and receive in exchange &quot;entrenched clauses&quot; which will be ineffective.     Inthe eyes of the Africans who are capable of thinking, and they are, ofcourse, a tiny minority, this is the real political issue.    They are there-fore likely to be receptive to the propaganda of Congress.13.      There will be a row about the Federal Governments franchiseproposals, and there may be an African boycott of what is known as the&apos;special roll&apos; at the next elections, but this is a minor trouble compared to the hardening of opinion on both sides which would result from adecision of the Federal Government to go to the country on a platform of immediate Dominion status.    I have no doubt that were we to turn down the Constitution Amendment Bill and the franchise proposals as not beingliberal enough, the Federal Prime Minister would go to the country on a programme of a less liberal franchise, Dominion status in I960, if not before, and of general defiance of the British Government.    If that werethe position, we should lose all along the line with deplorable consequences for European-African relations within the Federation and for UnitedKingdom and Federal co-operation in the future.14.      My conclusion on political tactics is that (a) we should try between now and I960 to avoid any hardening of the position and in particular ofEuropean opinion against African advance;    (The Federation is in a sensesuffering from an overdose of politics which is extremely unsettling to both settler and African and it needs a period of quiet consolidation.)    (b) weshould co-operate with the Federal Government in selling Federation tothe African who has never yet understood its advantages (this isparticularly important in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland);  and, (c),between now and 1960, when the next stage of Commonwealth advance is to-3-CONFIDENTIAL
be settled by the five Governments in consultation, we should find ways and means of reconciling the Europeans&apos; demand for full commonwealth membership with the African&apos;s concern that his rights should be entrenchedbeyond the possibility of interference and abuse.    It will be a majorconstitutional exercise, but if we can bring it off it will be the first realstep towards partnership between the races and the acceptance of federation in the hearts of its peoples.CONFIDENTIAL
