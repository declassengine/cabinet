secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. October 1957C. (57) 248Copy No.25th October, 1957CABINETFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Federal Government wish to enlarge the Federal House which is at presentundoubtedly too small. For this purpose they have passed a Bill amending the1953 Constitution. They propose to follow it by a Franchise Bill which will cater for the election of the larger House. As these proposals will entail a debate in theHouse of Commons and possible controversy, I would like my colleagues to know the position and the course of action which the Colonial Secretary and I proposeshould be followed.2. The 1953 Constitution (S.I. 1953 No. 1199) provided that the federal assembly should consist of 26 elected members.6 specially elected African members (two each from Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, though the two from SouthernRhodesia are in practice not &quot; specially elected,&quot; but &quot; elected &quot; on thecommon roll).3 European members with special responsibilities for African interests (one from each Territory).The new plan, now embodied in the Constitution Amendment Act, is to increasethe Assembly to 59 members, as follows:  44 elected members.8 elected African members (two each from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and four from Southern Rhodesia).4 specially elected African members (two each from Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland).3 European members with special responsibilities for African interests (one from each Territory).These figures preserve the proportions between the ordinary (European) members on the one hand and the African members plus representatives of African interests on the other. They actually double the number of African members while onlyincreasing the number of ordinary (European) members by two-thirds. Thetransfer of two Southern Rhodesian African members from the &quot; specially elected &quot;&apos;category to the &quot; elected &quot; category will enhance African participation in theirelection. The present two were elected on a common roll containing very fewAfricans. In future all four will be elected on the combined general and specialrolls, which will include far more Africans.52476
3. Action by the United Kingdom Government is necessary, because the 1953Constitution provides a special procedure for constitutional amendments. a constitutional Bill requires a two-thirds majority in the Federal Assembly and hasto be reserved for assent in this country. The Constitution also provides for a standing Committee of the Federal Assembly, called the African Affairs Board,which has the duty of drawing attention to any Bill which is in their opinion a&quot; differentiating measure,&quot; i.e., which makes Africans liable to any conditions,restrictions or disabilities, disadvantageous to them, to which Europeans are not also made liable. For this purpose they may lay a report before the Assembly atany stage while the Bill is in the Assembly, and, if it is passed, they may ask for ,itto be reserved. If the African Affairs Board ask for a constitutional Bill to be reserved, it can only be assented to by Order in Council, which has to lie beforeboth Houses of Parliament at Westminster for forty calendar days, during which itis subject to negative resolution.4. There was in fact no objection to the Constitution Amendment Bill fromthe African Affairs Board until, during the second reading debate, the federal government, in reply to a question, made a statement about their proposals forthe franchise on which the enlarged Assembly would be elected. These are breifly as follows.5. Electors will be divided into two rolls. First, the ordinary roll. This willbe open to Europeans and Africans and will elect the 44 ordinary members. the qualifications will be various combinations of income and education, the minimumbeing  300 income plus the Cambridge School Certificate. Secondly, the specialroll, which, combined with the Ordinary Roll, will elect the 8 &quot; elected &quot; Africans.The qualifications for this are  150 income plus simple literacy, or  120 income plustwo years secondary education. British Protected Persons, i.e., all Africans in thetwo Northern Territories, are made eligible for the vote for the first time, ifotherwise qualified.6. These new qualifications as I explain later are a substantial liberalisationon previous practice but there are two features which should be noted:  (a) There will for the time being be only a very small fraction of qualifiedAfricans on the ordinary roll.(b) In an attempt to get away from purely racial rolls the franchise proposalsprovide that the two rolls shall be combined for the election of the eight &quot; elected Africans &quot;: this will mean that in the aggregate vote forthese eight constituencies combined there will, for the time being, bea European majority.7. The African Affairs Board seized upon this last point and objected to theConstitution Amendment Bill as &quot; differentiating &quot; because it made such a franchisearrangement possible.   Their actual objections were:  (1) although the proportion was maintained of African members plus membersrepresenting African interests, the increase in the numerical differencebetween these and the ordinary members was to the disadvantage ofthe Africans;(2) racial representation ought to be &quot; honest.&quot; i.e., Africans ought to havethe major say in electing African representatives.8. The first objection is nonsense. The second cannot be said to bedifferentiating. Nothing whatever has been taken away from Africans which was granted them under the constitution. It is admitted that it is desirable to get away from purely racial rolls and the only question is what should the balance be betweenEuropean and Africans for the purpose of electing the eight Africans. When theysent their objection, the African Affairs Board did not know how many Africanswould be likely to qualify for the vote on the special roll. It is impossible to getaccurate forecasts, but it seems likely that an African majority will qualify in nyasaland in 1958 and in Northern Rhodesia by 1961, and that there will at once be a very large addition of qualified Africans in Southern Rhodesia. No one can besure of these forecasts and no one can tell how many qualified Europeans orAfricans, both of whom are apathetic, will apply for a vote, but on these estimatesmuch of the case of the African Affairs Board disappears.
9. For nearly three weeks while I was in the Federation in October, I hadexhaustive discussions with people representing all shades of opinion. As a result,I have no hesitation in recommending that we should advise the Royal Assent tothe Constitution Amendment Bill and that we shall be on strong ground in arguing that this Bill, taken with the franchise proposals, not only is not differentiating butmakes a liberal and substantial advance on the existing situation, for the following reasons:  (1) The increase in the number of African members will give more Africanspolitical experience: if the European members of the Federal Housebecome more evenly divided between parties, the influence of the twelve African members would become increasingly important;(2) British protected persons the majority of the population of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland will be eligible for the vote, for the first time;(3) Africans, if qualified, will get a full value vote on the ordinary roll;(4) The qualifications for the special roll ( 120 income plus two yearssecondary education or  150 income plus literacy) will make substantial numbers of Africans eligible at once and will almost certainly meanAfrican majorities in the two northern territories in the near future.In calculating income, the value of food and accommodation providedby employers is counted. The money wages required are therefore not unduly high. In any case African wages are rising steadily and educational facilities are expanding rapidly;(5) The proposals envisage an extension of the common roll principle whichshould work in the long run towards the political partnership that is desired.10. I must warn my colleagues that there may well be controversy both inthe Federation and in Parliament here where the Socialists may take up the AfricanAffairs Board case. I am sure we must take this risk. The alternative would beto turn down the Federal Government and force them to drop both bills. If we did that and on the merits we have no case for doing so the Prime Ministerof the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, would be bound to go to the country on aless liberal franchise, on Dominion status in 1960 and on general opposition toBritish interference in Federation affairs. He would be returned by a huge majority and the European attitude towards the African would have been hardeneddisastrously. Racial trouble would then be certain. It may be argued that SirRoy Welensky has missed a chance to be more liberal, and that, if he had addeda percentage of the lower qualified Africans to the ordinary roll, he would haveattracted the support of moderate Africans. But that is a matter of politicaljudgment: I pressed him and his Cabinet on it and they insisted that they couldnot carry their supporters if they suggested such a step. I propose therefore thatwe should proceed at once to table a draft Order in Council to assent to theConstitution Amendment Bill and that we should indicate in debate that the franchise proposals in their present form are good. No such proposals are thefinal word but they are a notable advance for the African.11. As I said at the beginning, the Colonial Secretary agrees with this courseof action.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,24th October, 1957.
