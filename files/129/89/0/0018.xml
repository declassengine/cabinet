EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA: MEETING OF ORGANISATION for european ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION MINISTERS-GENERALSTEERING BRIEFMemorandum by officials the Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed to his Ministerial colleagues on the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.) that they should meet in informal session in the middle of October for approximatly three days.Objective2. Our object at the meeting must be to get the negotiations started withoutfurther loss of time and to get such machinery established as will give us areasonable hope that they will be successful.3. It will not be possible in such a gathering to resolve the major problems;neither is it necessary to seek this. But it will be necessary that all seriousparticipants feel satisfied as a result of the meeting that there is a reasonable chance of countries coming together on their major, as distinct from their marginal,requirements to an extent which will make successful negotiations possible.The Agenda4. Ministers will have for consideration the report by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, attached at Annex A, and the reports of the Chairman of the threeWorking Parties. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Chancellor^ report in effect create the agenda for the first part of the meeting; they list the problems as they have appeared in the discussions so far:  A. (i) Scope of the Free Trade Area Convention,(ii) Origin and content qualification of goods,(iii) (1) Institutions of the Free Trade Area.(2) Relation between the obligations of the members of the free trade Area and of the Six Powers.(3) Arrangements for the close working together of the institutions of the Free Trade Area and the European economic community.B. Foodstuffs.C. (i) Problems of the &quot; peripherals.&quot;(ii) Additional capital requirements.5. Separate briefs on each of these items have been prepared. That onfoodstuffs is being submitted separately to the Cabinet. The others are availablefor use by Ministers, but a summary of them is attached at Annex B. It will bedesirable for all the main participants to indicate their views on these questions;indeed, it is on this exchange of views that all participants will be able to judge whether it is worth while going forward. We have not thought that it would be helpful to list here in detail the precise points on all these subjects which will beof concern to us and to other countries. But in general it can be said that theUnited Kingdom will be concerned in particular with the nature of the comments of the Six on the points raised in Section A. On these questions some membersmay take up rigid positions which we would be unable to accept, in which casea position of deadlock would be reached. But provided no inflexible positionswere taken and there was a reasonable prospect of further discussion resolvingthe differences, negotiations could proceed^ The Six and other countries,particularly Denmark, will be concerned with \he nature of the United Kingdom&apos;scomments on Section B (foodstuffs).52334b
The Outcome of the Negotiations6. The various briefs on particular topics indicate that, to meet both theUnited Kingdom requirements and the preoccupations of other countries, thefinal outcome of the negotiations, if they are successful, will be a &quot; package &quot; deal.The possible elements of such a deal could be:  (a) A Free Trade Area Convention providing for the removal of tariffs andquotas on industrial goods and the necessary rules of competition, &amp;c,intimately connected therewith.(b) Special arrangements for coal and steel, whether within or outside theConvention, to be decided later.(c) Something   on  agriculture,  probably  a  &quot; European  Agreement for agriculture.&quot;id) Draft decisions of varying content about some of the matters dealt within the Treaty of Rome which do not directly concern the limited free trade Area Convention or the Agreement for Agriculture (e.g.,invisibles, labour, &amp;c).7. Precisely where the line between (a) and (d) should be drawn will be amatter for detailed negotiation.8. In considering the future procedure and the negotiating machinery it isnecessary to have this general structure in mind.Future Procedure9. At the best the result of this discussion at the Ministerial meeting inOctober will reveal very wide divergences of opinion on these questions but, atthe same time, will give a reasonable prospect that the negotiations can be successful. In this event the meeting can proceed to establish future machinery,.Our objective here will be the establishment of a special Free Trade AreaCommittee. All members will be able to sit on this body and it will have theresponsibility for the whole range of negotiations; it will be concerned not only withdrawing up the Free Trade Area Convention but also with directing the work on agriculture and any other matters which it may be preferable to deal with in theexisting O.E.E.C. organisation rather than in the Free Trade Area Convention, e.g.,invisibles and manpower. It will also be responsible for working out how membersof the O.E.E.C. organisation who do not feel able to accept the full obligationscan be associated with the Free Trade Area.10. The range and difficulty of the matters to be discussed and settled in thespecial Free Trade Area Committee are such that, if possible, the members shouldbe represented by Ministers, though not necessarily by the normal Ministerialdelegates to O.E.E.C. For some countries this will not be possible; for Switzerlandit would be constitutionally impracticable. But we should not encourage countries whose part in the negotiations will be critical, such as Denmark, to appoint officialsas their normal negotiators.11. The special Free Trade Area Committee, if its creation is agreed on, willappear naturally a piece of machinery to assist the Chancellor in the role, given him as Chairman of the Council last February, to co-ordinate and direct allnegotiations and discussions arising out of, or connected with, the preparation ofa Free Trade Area. But though it may be desirable for him to attend its meetingsoccasionally and when he does he will as Chairman of the Council naturallypreside it will be necessary to provide a regular chairman. Although there areinevitably some disadvantages in having the chair, since it is not always easy, todefend a difficult national position there, it is doubtful whether there will be thenecessary drive unless the United -Kingdom has it. It will therefore be desirable,if possible, that the Paymaster-General be nominated chairman.12. The special Committee will need subordinate bodies, working parties, &amp;c:It should have power to create these, and the existing Working Parties 21, 22 and23, which at present depend on the Council, should be made subject to the directionof the special Committee so that all the threads may be pulled together in one place. &apos;SECRET-
13. We cannot count on negotiations in a seventeen-country Committeebeing rapid; indeed, if it cannot be reduced and some smaller steering groupdeveloped we cannot expect a successful outcome to the negotiations. Ideally, weshould like to obtain agreement at the October meeting to the formal constitutionof such a group. But it does not seem likely that such agreement can be reached in October, and unless there is an unexpected change we should not take any steps to secure it during the October meeting. We should leave the special free trade Area Committee to work, expecting that the need for the smaller group will then become apparent. Moreover, the powers given to the Chancellor, as chairman of the Council, last February to consult whom he thinks fit will remainunimpaired, and may provide the means of creating a smaller group to deal with the crucial issues.14. The formal recognition in the negotiating machinery that all the questions referred to in paragraph 9 above, and in particular agriculture (which will have beendiscussed as one of the problems mentioned in the Chancellors report), will haveto be dealt with together even though they form part of separate legal instrumentsmay well appear to the Continental countries as a significant move forward bythe United Kingdom. We hope this will be sufficient to launch the negotiations.There are dangers in this. Unless the United Kingdom has made quite clear what it cannot do in the agricultural field, there is a risk that the creation of this machinerymight precipitate serious political difficulties within the United Kingdom and evenin the Commonwealth. On the other hand, if the United Kingdom indicates onlythe things that it cannot do and does not indicate the general lines of what it isprepared to consider, there may not be agreement in the Council to go forward with the negotiations. This problem is dealt with in detail in the separate briefon agriculture.The Risk of Deadlock15. It may be that after the exchange of views on the points set out in the chancellors message there will not be any reasonable ground on the basis of thevarious statements made that the negotiations can be successful. This couldhappen if we thought that the French statement on the sort of Free Trade Areathey could accept was so unreal and unsatisfactory as to give little chance of everreaching agreement, or if other countries considered our statement on foodstuffs to be an inadequate basis for negotiation. In this event, it appears now to be preferable that the meeting be adjourned rather than that the procedural deviceof creating the special Free Trade Area Committee be used to break the deadlock.It would not be desirable to set up the special Free Trade Area Committee.if itwas certain to run immediately into a deadlock which we had failed to break at the october meeting. It would be better to adjourn the meeting and by diplomaticmeans, including smaller Ministerial meetings and visits, to seek to move forwardrather than to create a new Committee before there is any prospect that it can douseful work.Recommendations16. We recommend that, if the statements at the October meeting givereasonable hope that negotiations can be successful, we should seek to reach agreement on the following points:  (1) The negotiations should cover (a) The Free Trade Area Convention (and provision for coal and steel).(b) An Agreement for Agriculture.(c) Other matters not falling within id) and (6) but which it is desirableto settle at the same time.(d) Methods of association of members who feel unable to accept all theobligations of the Free Trade Area Convention.(2) The co-ordination and direction of all these matters should be entrusted to a special Free Trade Area Committee composed of Ministers, orexceptionally officials, from all member countries.(3) The Paymaster-General should be chairman of the special Committee.52234
(4) The special Committee should be authorised to set up new inter-Governmental bodies without further reference to the Council, andshould take over direction of the existing Working Parties 21, 22 and 23.(We should take care to ensure that the terms of reference under whichthe special Committee is set up do not inhibit in any way the prospect ofsecuring the later establishment of a smaller steering group.)Annex a free TRADE AREA NEGOTIATIONSReport to O.E.E.C. by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, July 1957It became clear some time ago, for reasons well known to all of us, that theWorking Parties set up in O.E.E.C. to hammer out the problems of creating a free trade Area would not be able to move as fast as some of us had hoped whenMinisters last met in O.E.E.C. in February. I therefore asked the Chairmen ofthe three Working Parties to make personal reports to me on the state of the work.I am arranging for these reports to be circulated to members of the Organisation.I, and I am sure all my colleagues, are most grateful for the work which these threegentlemen have done for us both in their labours in the Working Parties and in preparing these reports. It quite clearly emerges from these documents that,despite the decision we took last February to enter into negotiations, we have notyet been able to tackle some major issues, on which the discussions have shownthat we are widely divided: there is far from a community of view among us asto what kind of Free Trade Area we want.2. The first essential point on which there must be general agreement is, dowe accept as our objective the creation of a Free Trade Area? I have been muchencouraged in my discussion with a number of Ministers to find that they do feelthat it is in the best interest of Europe that we should succeed in our endeavour to complement the Customs Union by a Free Trade Area to maintain widerco-operation and avoid division. I hope that we shall all keep this essential needconstantly in mind during the negotiations: we shall not be successful unless we do.3. What are the major points on which we must at least move together alittle if negotiations are to have any prospect of success? They appear to me tobe the following:  A. (i) In general, what should be the scope of the Free Trade AreaConvention? We are all agreed that if a Free Trade Area is to succeed there will have to be continued co-operation, and indeedfurther progress, in many fields other than the removal of tariffs and quotas. But we are not clear on how to do this. Should we seek in the Convention to deal specifically with all those mattersrelevant to a Free Trade Area which fall within the Treaty of rome? Or, alternatively, should we deal in the Convention only with tariffs, quotas and other essentially related matters such asrules of fair competition while we provide at the same time for continued work and where necessary take new decisions forfurther progress in other fields of economic co-operation inO.E.E.C.?(ii) So far as the movement of goods is concerned, do we accept that while we all keep our own external tariff autonomy we should haveliberal rules for defining the origin and content qualification ofgoods entitled to move freely within the Area?(iii) We are all agreed that the Free Trade Area will require newinstitutions and procedures, including voting procedures, whichmay differ in important respects from those at present used inO.E.E.C.   It will be necessary to agree also on:  (1) what institutions and procedures, including voting procedures,the Convention should provide for; and
(2) what measures should be taken to relate the reciprocalobligations of the members of the Free Trade Area to thoseof the signatories of the Treaty of Rome;(3) what arrangements should be made to ensure that the institutions established under the Rome Treaty and those ofthe Free Trade Area work closely and continuouslytogether.B. On foodstuffs there are serious questions to consider. How far are themembers of O.E.E.C., including the signatories of the Treaty of rome, willing to agree now to enter into reciprocal arrangements with all or any of the members of O.E.E.C. about trade infoodstuffs including the removal of tariffs and quotas, similar to oridentical with those proposed and envisaged by the Treaty of rome? Some members have made it plain that they regard this as impossible. Are there other arrangements which members ofO.E.E.C., including the Six, would be prepared to accept?C. (i) Certain members of O.E.E.C. have indicated their desire to be associated with the Free Trade Area while feeling unable to subscribe to the full obligations of members at least at the outset.It appears to me that until there is some general agreement on thequestions in Parts A and B above these countries will not be ableto state in detail how far they would require derogations from theordinary rules of membership, nor shall we be able to seearrangements worked out for associating with the Free Trade Areamembers of O.E.E.C. who are not able to accept the generalobligations.(ii) Certain members feel that they will not be able to join or be associatedwith the Free Trade Area unless they have additional resources of external capital available to them to assist in their development andreadaptation. How far can this additional capital be madeavailable? Are new institutional arrangements needed, and if so what arrangements would be appropriate?4. I doubt whether we can reasonably ask officials to do much further workin Paris on these problems until they have been discussed at a meeting of Ministers.I should therefore like to make the following proposals for procedure in theimmediate future.5. Firstly, I think we should all of us in our capitals during the coming weeksgive most earnest attention to these basic problems and consider what we can do totake account of the diverse positions of our partners.6. Secondly, I suggest that we should meet together as soon as is practicable to consider all these problems. I believe that, given the diversities of view thatexist now, we should regard this primarily as an informal meeting of Ministers.This would not prevent our meeting as a Council if we wish to conduct any formalbusiness. At that meeting we should seek to take stock of the position, and consider by what methods and procedures the negotiations concerning the free trade Area should be conducted. I will very shortly make proposals on the dateof such a meeting.7. It will also be necessary to consider the negotiations which will be requiredto bring coal and steel within the Free Trade Area.8. I am sure I do not need to emphasise the importance of the matters towhich we set our hand last February. It will be a very serious day for Europe ifwe are not able to create a Free Trade Area as a complement to the european economic Community established by the Treaty of Rome. We have made considerable progress in understanding the complexities of the problems and theattitudes of the various members. But it is clear that we shall not create a real and effective Free Trade Area as a complement to the Customs Union unless we are alldetermined to succeed and are all prepared for an intensive and continuous effort.July 1957.SECRET52334 b 3
; Annex BSUMMARY OF ADDITIONAL BRIEFSThis note summarises the proposed United Kingdom position on the subjectsother than foodstuffs, mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Chancellor^ report(Annex A) and listed in paragraph 4 of the general steering brief. These are:Scope of the Free Trade Area Convention.Origin and content qualification of goods.Institutions.Relation between the obligations of members of the Free Trade Area andof the Six.Arrangements for the close working together of the institutions of the free trade Area and the European Economic Community.Problem of the &quot; Peripherals.&quot;Additional capital requirements.More detailed briefs on all these subjects have been prepared for the use of theUnited Kingdom delegation to the October meeting.Scope of the Free Trade Area Convention2. Our original concept of an industrial Free Trade Area was of a convention to promote freedom of trade in industrial goods, and which would deal with tariffs and quotas and such essentially related points as rules of competition and appropriate institutions, devised within the O.E.E.C. framework, to handle thenecessary management functions. The Treaty of Rome establishing the european economic Community is based on a very different concept. The Treaty deals withthe whole range of economic policy and the Community is regarded primarily as an instrument designed to enable the Six to develop their resources in common.(i) It is unlikely that we can negotiate the industrial Free Trade Area unless we are prepared to accept some commitments outside the field of tariffs and quotas and directly related matters. Some O.E.E.C. members not only the Six will wish to insist on accompanying commitments inother fields, e.g., for invisibles. Apart from the views which othercountries will urge in negotiation, further examination has shown thatit will probably be to our advantage to have some additional obligations in the fields of invisibles, establishment and services, either in theConvention or separately.(ii) If we abandoned our original concept and set out to negotiate aConvention of wide scope, the natural model would be the Treaty of rome, and we should be exposed to pressure to agree to the inclusionof subjects which we want to exclude. Further, we should be likelyto alarm opinion both in the United Kingdom and in theCommonwealth.(hi) The balance of advantage lies in maintaining the original limited concept of the industrial Free Trade Area, while at the same time being preparedto accept either obligations of substance, or else commitments toundertake further study, on some other subjects in O.E.E.C. outsidethe scope of the Convention. This need not rule out the possibilityof including some such commitments in the Convention itself, if thisproves desirable in the course of negotiation.Origin and content qualification of goods3. The problem of defining the origin of goods arises because in a Free trade area the external tariffs of member countries will normally differ, and third countries will therefore have an incentive to export to the whole of the Area via the member country with the lowest external tariff, to the detriment of member countries with higher tariffs. This difficulty can only be overcome by agreeing inadvance the circumstances in which goods are to be regarded as having been produced within the Free Trade Area for the purpose of claiming entitlement to duty-free entry into other Area countries.
4. We are in favour of rules which would extend the benefits of the free trade Area to the bulk of trade passing between Member countries. Subject toone qualification, this would be achieved by our proposal that all goods shouldqualify for Free Trade Area tariff treatment if at least 50 per cent, of their valuehas been added in the Area. The qualification, which in our view is a vital one,is that certain listed basic materials imported in substantial quantities from outsidethe Area, e.g., non-ferrous metals, timber, paper pulp, petroleum, &amp;c, should bedeemed to be of Free Trade Area origin when calculating the Area content of goodsmade from those materials.5. The difficulty is that some countries, notably France and Italy, at presenthave a policy of high tariff protection on basic materials, which they are unwilling to surrender. This is a question on which the Six could not agree before the signature of the Treaty of Rome. They have therefore postponed a decision onthese items (List G of Annex I to the Treaty of Rome) until after the Treaty hascome into force. If Germany and the Benelux countries continue to oppose apolicy of high and effective tariff protection on these basic materials, there is noprocedure under the Treaty to ensure that agreement is reached between the Six,in which case the existing tariffs on these materials will continue to be applied.6. If the Six eventually agreed on a high level of tariff protection for basic materials, it would in practice be impossible for them to allow goods made in theFree Trade Area from materials produced outside the Area (e.g., zinc sheets madein the United Kingdom from Australian zinc) to qualify for free entry into theCustoms Union.7. It is recommended that the line to be taken by the United Kingdom onthese questions should be as follows:  (i) We cannot agree to proposals e.g., limited harmonisation of tariffs which would make it necessary for us to treat the Commonwealth lessfavourably than Europe.(ii) We see serious objections to administrative procedures e.g., a tax oh thematerial content of goods imported into the Customs Union from theFree Trade Area which would in effect concede to the Six the rightto unilateral retention of tariffs.(iii) We want to see a reasonably low percentage of Free Trade Area content,combined with a satisfactory list of basic materials, agreed as the qualifications for Free Trade Area tariff treatment.(iv) There does not in practice appear to be any way in which to reconcile theretention of high tariff protection on basic materials in the customs union, or in any other Free Trade Area country, with the creation ofan effective Free Trade Area covering the great bulk of intra-Europeantrade in industrial goods. We must therefore express the hope that whatever the Six may decide to do about the common tariff on basic materials on which it is not for us to advise them they will not allowtheir decisions (or failure to take decisions) to prejudice the setting upof a Free Trade Area on the lines we have proposed, i.e., one involvingacceptance of criteria of origin as in (iii) above.(The French and Italians may argue that the 50 per cent, rule will lead to theimport, via the low tariff countries such as Denmark, of cheap semi-manufactures(e.g., chemicals, machinery components and textiles) from outside the Area. Ourview on this is that we are not prepared to accept in advance generally restrictivearrangements to cover hypothetical difficulties which in the end may not be serious.But we should be prepared to consider remedies if and when difficulties arose.)Institutions8. (i) The United Kingdom proposal is for a Free Trade Area to beestablished within the framework of O.E.E.C., with such modifications of existing procedure and practice as may be necessary.(ii) The institutions should be headed by a Council of Ministers.(iii) It will be necessary to establish a body of officials to deal with the day-to-day management of the Free Trade Area. Such a body could be either:  (a) a Board of National officials; or(b) a Commission of international officials.
In either case its membership would need to be restricted to asmall number.   Our preference is for (a).(iv) Whichever type of managing body were adopted, it should not haverights of initiative similar to those which the European Commission ofthe Six will possess. For all practical purposes the Council of ministers of the European Economic Community can take no decision by majority vote except on the recommendation of the Commission. Inthe Free Trade Area we should not wish to accept any arrangement which limited the authority of the Ministers of the member countries to this extent. The Council of Ministers of the Free Trade Area should,have power to take decisions either by unanimity or majority voteaccording to the subject matter, regardless of the recommendation made,by the managing body.(v) Unanimous voting should be the rule, except where the Conventionexpressly provides otherwise. But there will be a number of subjects,which must be precisely defined in the Convention, for which majorityvoting will be necessary if the Free Trade Area is to work satisfactorily.Examples of such subjects are approval of proposals for implementingspecific obligations, where the details need to be worked out, and approval of derogations from precise obligations; majority votingwould also seem appropriate for cases where countries are allowed totake action without previously consulting the organisation but arerequired to seek approval after the event. It will be necessary to insist on unanimity for altering the provisions of the Convention or foradopting obligations not defined in it but left for subsequent definition.Unanimity would also be appropriate for approving appointments tothe managing body.(vi) Detailed methods of voting need not be discussed at this stage.Relation between the obligations of members of the Free Trade Area and of the Six9. (i) In the sphere of trade in industrial goods and materials we are preparedto accept international obligations and objectives comparable with thoseof the Treaty of Rome. In these fields our objective ideally would bea Free Trade Area Convention containing a set of rules binding on each individual signatory in relation to all other individual signatories,governing their relations with each other and prohibiting alldiscrimination between them.(ii) Though we should get as near as we can to a Convention of this kind,it will almost certainly not be acceptable to the Six. It would implysuperseding those parts of the Treaty of Rome which deal with the sametopics as the Free Trade Area Convention and would seriously limit the powers of the institutions of the European Economic Community.(iii) Although, therefore, we cannot expect to obtain a Convention which by its very nature avoids all danger of discrimination against UnitedKingdom traders in the field of industrial goods and materials, wemust try to avoid such discrimination by two methods:  (a) On things which really matter to us the terms of the Free trade area Convention and of the Treaty of Rome must be effectivelythe same; that is to say, we must either adopt in the convention the provisions of the Rome Treaty, or in any cases in which these provisions are seriously objectionable seek to write in acceptableprovisions sufficiently precise to override the correspondingarticles of the Rome Treaty and to bind the Six as signatories ofthe Convention.(b) The administration of the rules of the Free Trade Area and of theEuropean Economic Community, where they cover common ground, must be similar. In order to secure this object close co-operation between the Institutions of the Area and of theCommunity will be essential (paragraph 10 below).
(iv) The more the provisions of the Free Trade Area Convention limit thefreedom of its members, the more the centre of power will move to the institutions of the Area. Contrariwise, the less the Convention limits the freedom of members of the Area, the more the centre of power will rest in the institutions of the European Economic Community,where we shall have no influence.Arrangements for the Close Working Together of the Institutions of the Free trade area and the European Economic Community10. (i) Council of Ministers. We envisage that the supreme governing bodyof the Free Trade Area will be the Council of Ministers. The Treaty of rome delegates important powers to the European Commission, but weshould seek to secure that all major Powers in the Free Trade area will be exercised by the Ministerial Council. Provided the Six are represented individually by their Ministers on the Council of the free trade Area, Ministers of the non-Six will have the maximumopportunity for ensuring that decisions are taken on a European, andnot a &quot; little Europe &quot; basis,(ii) Liaison between the Managing Bodies. The Free Trade Area will havea managing body dealing with subjects similar to some of those dealtwith by the European Commission, though its powers will be more restricted and it will cover a narrower range of topics. None the less the major questions will be dealt with by both. It will be desirable toensure some common membership and close liaison arrangements.. (hi) Delegations.-The role of the national delegations will be important bothin the Free Trade Area and in the European Economic Community.The normal contacts between delegations will facilitate the working outof similar solutions to problems in both organisations provided the delegations are in the same place. This is a strong reason for havingboth organisations in the same place. If they are it is almost certainthat the national delegations of the Six to the European economic community will be the same as their delegations to the Free Trade Area.If they are not, then there will be no basis for contact between, forexample; the United Kingdom delegation to the Free Trade Area and; the German delegation to the European Economic Community.- (iv) Secretariats.-!! there is to be effective co-operation between the secretariatr of the two bodies, they must be in or near the same place.   Thiswill not only avoid duplication of staff, but will assist the developmentof common attitudes in both bodies.Problems of the &quot; Peripherals &quot;11. There are some O.E.E.C. member countries (Turkey, Greece, Iceland,the Irish Republic, and though perhaps to a more limited extent Portugal) who cannot, or think they cannot, accept the obligations of a Free Trade Area in fullimmediately. [For convenience these countries are commonly described as the&quot; peripherals,&quot; but this term should not be used in public] In general the lesssaid at the October meeting -about the problems of the &quot; peripherals &quot; the better.To the extent that it is necessary to discuss them, the following points might be made;the fourth would be better avoided, if possible:  (i) The work so far undertaken in Working Party No. 23 of the councils revealing the nature of the difficulties which face certain member countries. Those countries which have discussed their position in thatWorking Party are, we understand, now reviewing their judgment ofwhat they could do in the light of the discussions.(ii) If time is not to be wasted, it is important that study of this problem should go on concurrently with consideration of the possible rules and scope of the Free Trade Area so that means of meeting the difficultiesof countries unable to accept the full obligations of a Free Trade Areacan be considered against an established factual background when broadideas on the basic rules of a Free Trade Area are sufficiently advanced.
(hi) It is generally assumed, and we do not dissent from this view, that some special arrangements will be needed to allow the association of certain countries with the Free Trade Area. We cannot now suggest eitherwhat they should be, or what institutional arrangements would be appropriate. The facts must first be established.(iv) It has already been suggested that some countries might be required tocomply with a slower time-table in dismantling their tariffs and quotasthan others. We cannot now express a view on that. Until the broadlines of the basic obligations of the Free Trade Area are known wecannot make any progress on these questions.Additional Capital Requirements12. After the O.E.E.C. Council meeting in February the Chancellor, in settingthe tasks for Working Parties 21, 22 and 23, added that special arrangements mightbe necessary for the consideration of other important questions such as theestablishment of a Development (Investment) Bank for the Free Trade Area. Hewould make proposals later.(i) It is important that at the October meeting the United Kingdom shouldnot indicate antagonism to the whole idea of such a bank (although in fact we do dislike it). To do so might prejudice the chances of getting negotiations started. Without, therefore, saying anything whichimplies acceptance of the idea, we should take the line that at this stagewe are able to make no firm judgment. The problem needs much further examination before any such judgment can be made.(ii) As suggested by the Chairman of Working Party No. 23, it will benecessary for underdeveloped countries to explain just what additionalfinance they need, and why, and for these explanations to be examinedcarefully.(iii) It will be desirable to examine the adequacy of existing institutions formobilising and channelling development capital and the question whetherthe institution of the Free Trade Area calls for any modification of oraddition to them. The United Kingdom is very ready to consider with other members of O.E.E.C. how best this could be done. (Aproposal that such an examination might be conducted by the ManagingBoard of the European Payments Union, or by a special body on which that Board was represented, has already been canvassed informallyby Sir H. Ellis-Rees with the Secretariat and the Chairman of working party No. 23. Both opposed the institution of any such examinationuntil the studies of Working Party No. 23 were further advanced.)
