THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1957CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (57) 21526th September, 1957CABINETGHANAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations think ray colleagues may like to have the following account of events sincemy memorandum C. (57) 210 of 19th September.2. On 18th September, Mr. Shawcross flew to Accra from Lagos and was refused admittance to Ghana; he returned immediately to Lagos. In the lightof representations from the High Commissioner in Accra and of other developments,I decided that the United Kingdom reply to the Ghana Governments Note shouldbe delivered in a rather milder form than that given in Annex B of C. (57) 210.The text of the Note as delivered is now attached at Annex A. Whencommunicating it to the Ghana Government, the High Commissioner was instructed to stress that we had been, and would be, scrupulously careful to avoid any apparent interference in Ghana&apos;s domestic affairs, and also to emphasise the distinction which we draw between administrative action to exclude Mr. Shawcross,and the alternative procedure (which would have been adopted in this country)of leaving it to the Court itself to prevent any abuse of its facilities and maintaindiscipline among advocates appearing before it. The High Commissioner handedthe reply to the Acting Prime Minister of Ghana on 21st September, and reportsthat their talk was entirely amicable; the only point which Mr. Botsio made wasto query the ability of the Court, in the circumstances of Ghana, to over-aweeminent barristers from overseas.3. The Court at Kumasi met on 20th September for the criminal proceedings against Mr. Colvin (paragraph 8 of C. (57) 210). Mr. Colvin, was not, of course,present, the Daily Telegraph having instructed him to return to London. HisCounsel asked for an adjournment of 28 days, and the Court granted this,over-riding some rather perfunctory protests by the Crown.4. Dr. Nkrumah returned to Accra on 22nd September and summoned anearly Cabinet meeting. On 24th September he announced in a broadcast thatthe proceedings against Mr. Colvin were being dropped; but that in view of thecircumstances surrounding recent events, neither Mr. Shawcross nor Mr. Colvinwould be allowed to re-enter Ghana until some time had passed and a sense of proportion had been restored. Dr. Nkrumah went on to stress that the GhanaGovernment could not allow lawyers, especially from abroad, to use the GhanaCourts for political purposes. Extracts from Press reports of Dr. Nkrumah&apos;sstatement are attached at Annex B.5. The Daily Telegraph has to-day announced that the writs issued againstDr. Nkrumah and other Ghana authorities will be withdrawn.6. It is heartening that Dr. Nkrumah has agreed to counsels of moderationand I think we can regard his statement as being as satisfactory as could reasonably be expected in the circumstances. It is to be hoped, too, that the whole episode,with the embarrassing publicity for Ghana which it has involved, may leave aneducative effect. And now that the charges against Mr. Colvin have been dropped and the writs withdrawn, we may hope that the whole affair will be allowed toblow over.   Dr. Nkrumah did not say that the case against the Ashanti Pioneer52308
was being dropped; and it is reported in the Press than the Ghana Government have announced the substitution of another Judge for the present Acting Chief Justice,who found against the Government on the question of competence in the contemptof Court proceedings in Accra (paragraph 7 of C. (57) 210). It is therefore much too early to assume that the Ghana Governments internal policy has radicallychanged. But we may reasonably hope that the episode will have openedDr.. Nkrumah&apos;s eyes to the difficulties in which he is likely to be involved byMr. Edusei and Mr. Bing.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. I,25th September, 1957.ANNEX a text of Reply to Ghana Government Note of 16th September delivered by theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Accra on 21st SeptemberHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom wish to thank her majesty&apos;s Government in Ghana for their Note of 16th September about the admission of citizens of the United Kingdom who are not citizens of Ghana to practise law in Ghana. The United Kingdom Government fully share the hopeof the Ghana Government that it will be possible to continue the practice bywhich lawyers from the United Kingdom are admitted to plead in the Courts of ghana.2. The United Kingdom Government have no desire to comment on any matter which is a domestic concern of an independent Government. Nor ofcourse do they wish to express any views upon issues before the Courts.3. However in the fourth paragraph of their Note the Government of Ghanastate the conditions which they would expect any United Kingdom lawyerpractising in Ghana to observe. In this connection the United KingdomGovernment express the hope that any attempt to abuse the facilities of the Courtby any such lawyer, would be dealt with as appropriate by the Court.4. The United Kingdom Government warmly reciprocate the desire of theGhana Government that the good and close relations which exist between thetwo countries should be fully maintained.. ANNEX BExtracts from Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s broadcast on 24th September (as reported in thePress)Since my return from holidays I have reviewed recent events which havefocused international attention on this country.As I have said before, I understand this world interest in our affairs, for we appreciate the importance of what is happening in Ghana to the rest of Africa,and that our performance in self-government can have a direct bearing on events in other parts of this great continent.* * *I feel that some of the comments have shown an understanding of our problems,and a genuine desire to help.There have been other examples, however, where criticism has been ignorantor malicious, in some cases both, and clearly intended to embarrass theGovernment of Ghana and to make our task still more difficult.
The first duty of a Government is to govern, hence the preservation of ourinternal security is paramount, it is imperative.I wonder if those abroad who have criticised us fully appreciate this problem in Ghana, where we have to deal with a complex relationship of feudal, tribaland other factors, and where we have to fight against inspired rumours and viciousmisrepresentations.It is obvious that we are dealing with conditions quite unlike those in many;other countries. Thus we must adopt methods appropriate to the problems wehave to solve, and still preserve the basic rights of the individual.It has been rumoured that the Government has a list of people it intends to deport. This is not so but I have emphasised again that the Government is determined to preserve law and order and will not tolerate subversive activities inany form.My Government will not hesitate to act if unlawful or subversive, and I repeat the words, unlawful and subversive, methods are used to undermine it. Let megive a practical example of this.* * *We have taken every step to see that public opinion is fully informed by wayof Radio Ghana relays of B.B.C. news bulletins and editorial opinions from theBritish Press&apos;and through the Ghana News Agency, which relays a Reuter&apos;s service to all Ghana newspapers.The judiciary is unfettered. The most recent African appointments to the bench include two former politicians who were very active members of theOpposition parties.The latest appointment to the Ghana Appeal Court is an English Queen&apos;sCounsel who was a former member of the General Council of the Bar in theUnited Kingdom.When the international Press and radio comment on our affairs, I hope thatthey will keep facts such as these in mind. I hope that they will constantly strive toincrease their understanding of our problems.I also hope they will appreciate the responsibilities which face us, a newnation working in an almost blinding limelight of world publicity, and I renew aplea which I made publicly to the world Press in London a few weeks ago.Do not apply to us standards of conduct and efficiency which are often notattained in your own countries. It is this form of hypocritical criticism which Ibelieve does more to arouse anger and resentment than anything else..As to recent court proceedings, the only important issue now outstanding isthe charge pending against Mr. Colvin of the Daily Telegraph in the magistratescourt. The Attorney-General has informed me that in the present circumstances he does not propose to continue these proceedings.This decision means that it will not now be necessary for Mr. Colvin to returnto this country. As a consequence, the question of Mr. Christopher Shawcross orany other lawyer coming to Ghana to defend Mr. Colvin will not arise.In view of the circumstances surrounding these events the Government of ghana has decided that it would be in the best interest of all concerned not to allowthese two gentlemen to re-enter Ghana until some time has passed and a sense of proportion has been restored.I wish to stress, however, that any lawyer who fulfils the conditions imposed by our laws as to entry into Ghana and admission to our Bar will always be welcomein Ghana.What the Government cannot accept is that legal proceedings are conducted insuch a way that they amount to improper interference in the political and internal affairs of Ghana.My Government cannot allow lawyers, especially from abroad, to use thecourts of Ghana for political purposes. If we were to allow this it would destroy the concept of justice which we are trying to strengthen, namely, that the courts areabove politics and that judges in Ghana should not be involved in political issues.
