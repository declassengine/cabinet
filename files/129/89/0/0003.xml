(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 20311th September, 1957.HIRE-FURCHASE RESTRICTIONSMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeCOPY NO.CABINETI do not agree that a tightening of hire-purchase restrictions would make any worthwhile contribution to relieving the present situation.At the same time it would have very adverse effects on the industriesmaking the goods affected.2.      In my view the restrictions are not nearly so effective incombating inflation as has been claimed.    Sales on hire-purchaseaccount for barely Zj per cent of consumer expenditure (in 1956 300 millions out of  13,400 millions).    Even in the case of new carsonly one in five is bought on hire-purchase.     Moreover any seriouscheck on total expenditure caused when the control is imposed ortightened is short-lived, since the fall in sales of controlled goods is soonoffset by a shift in spending to other goods and services.    The UnitedStates, after an exhaustive survey of the subject, have rejected hire-purchase control as an economic weapon.3.      Hire-purchase control has been an easy instrument to operate,but it is a blunt one.    It is in practice a discriminatory, not a general,control.    It interferes with production plans and often hampers exportefforts by raising unit costs of production.    Frequent changes in theprescribed terms - and there have been four in the past two years,the last as recent as 29th May - aggravate these obstacles, and yet another, and drastic, change would be bitterly resented by industry.For certain firms, and indeed for certain industries, the effect might becrippling.4.      It would also lead to a sharp rise in contraventions (there are over 40 prosecutions in hand at present) and encourage the developmentof other forms of consumer credit which cannot be controlled under existing statutory powers.    Nor, of course, can department store creditaccounts be restricted or bank overdrafts be made illegal.    the criticism would be made that once more the poor man&apos;s credit system isbeing hit while the rich man&apos;s system is left alone.    Finally, any action by the Government to increase the weekly hire-purchase instalmentsis likely to encourage the pressure for higher wages.D. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.11th September, 1957.
