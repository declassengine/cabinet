secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957C. (57) 227 Copy No.7th October, 1957CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Commonwealth Secretary has arranged for a debate on House of lords reform to take place on a Motion by Lord Teynham, Chairman of the IndependentUnionist Peers, on two days during the week of Tuesday, 29th October. Duringthe debate Government speakers will disclose the proposals for reform approved inprinciple by the Cabinet on 16th May (C.C. (57) 41st Conclusions, Minute 2). Inhis absence abroad, the Commonwealth Secretary has asked me to obtain theviews of the Cabinet on two outstanding matters connected with our proposals.Both of them have been the subject of a good deal of informal discussion duringthe past months and are almost certain to be raised during the debate,A. Hereditary Peeresses in Their Own Right2. There are at present 22 hereditary Peeresses in their own right, of whom5 hold Scottish Peerages only. In addition there are 20 other English Peerageswhich are capable of being held by a woman. Lord Home originally proposednot to deal with them in the Bill on the ground that it is strictly limited to thecreation of life Peerages and that if we bring in hereditary Peeresses we shall beextending the hereditary principle. It is, of course, intended that the Bill should enable life Peerages to be conferred on women.3. Lord Home and I have discussed this question again and we now considerthat it will be difficult to defend the exclusion of hereditary Peeresses if the point is pressed. There can be no real question of extending the hereditary principle,because these ladies already hold hereditary Peerages which will pass to theireldest surviving issue who, if male, are entitled of right to sit in the House ofLords. Moreover there is much force in the argument that their existingdisqualification is a breach of the principle that women ought not to be debarredby reason of their sex alone from holding- positions in our public life.4. In all the circumstances we suggest that we should be authorised to promise full consideration by the Government if the claims of hereditary Peeressesare pressed in the debate.B. Members of the House of Commons Succeeding to Hereditary Peerages5. The Cabinet accepted Lord Home&apos;s suggestion that the Bill as introducedshould not include a provision to enable Members of the House of Commons whosucceed to hereditary Peerages to renounce their rights to sit and vote in the lords, whether for their lifetime or some shorter period. The main ground forthis decision was that such a provision would increase the difficulties in defendingour decision not to embark on a comprehensive reform of the whole system of hereditary legislators. On the other hand, there will almost certainly be pressure in the House of Commons for the inclusion of some such provision, and I believethat Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn, M.P., has recently asked the Prime Ministerto make provision for it.52344
6. Lord Home still thinks that this proposal goes too far beyond the purposesof the intended Bill, and he would propose to say in the debate that the government can hold out no hope of including it in the forthcoming legislation.On the other hand he and I agree that the matter is essentially one for theHouse of Commons and that we should not attempt to oppose it on principle ifit becomes clear that the Commons wish it to be enacted. However this raisesa technical difficulty, on which we should be grateful for guidance.7. The Bill prepared to give effect to the Cabinefs decision of 16th Mayhas a Long Title limited to the creation of life Peers and Peeresses, and is virtuallya one-clause Bill. I have discussed with the draftsman whether a Bill passed bythe Lords in this limited form could be amended in the Commons to include a clause about renunciation. There is no doubt that such a clause would be out of order in the absence of an instruction to the Committee: and it is pretty clearthat it could not be made the subject of an instruction. Others can appreciate thedifficulties better than I can, but I thought it right to draw attention to the factthat it would probably be impossible to insert a renunciation clause in a Bill strictly limited to the creation of life Peers and Peeresses even if the House of commons and the Government want to do so. If we decided to add to the Bill as introduced a clause about hereditary Peeresses, it would still be uncertain whether the Speakerwould allow an instruction to the Committee to insert a renunciation clause: one cannot forecast what view the Speaker would take.8. It might be possible to draw the Long Title of the Bill in wide enough terms to ensure that a clause about renunciation was plainly within its scope. But I am advised that it would be impossible to do so without opening the door to a vastnumber of other amendments, with the result that we might find ourselvesembroiled in arguments on the countless rival schemes of Lords reform.9. I conclude that there is no satisfactory method by which we can be certain of attaining our two objectives, namely, to leave us uncommitted in the Lords onthe question of renunciation but to enable the Commons to debate that issue onan amendment to the Bill. On balance I should favour introducing the Bill in the lords with the strictly limited title (i.e., life Peerages and, if necessary, hereditaryPeeresses) and taking the risk that it may not prove possible in the end to move an instruction about a renunciation clause in the Commons even if we want to. Ifpressure for such a clause proves strong and we cannot get an instruction, we might consider offering to bring in another Bill to meet the wishes of the Commons onthe point.10.   On behalf of the Commonwealth Secretary, I ask the Cabinet:  (1) to authorise Government speakers in the debate on House of Lords Reformto promise favourable consideration if the claims  of hereditaryPeeresses are pressed;(2) to express their views on the best procedural method to be adopted for enabling the question of renunciation to be dealt with in the House ofCommons.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,4th October, 1957.
