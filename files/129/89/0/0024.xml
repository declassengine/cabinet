CONFIDENTIAL(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTOn 5th June, 1957, the Committee on Civil Aviation Policy agreed inprinciple to implementing recommendations made to me by the air transport Advisory Council for easing the restrictions hitherto imposed on the independent air transport companies in providing &quot;Colonial Coach&quot;air services to British territories overseas.    I had asked the Council to review the existing arrangements following criticism of the Governmentearlier in the year for refusing to allow Hunting-Clan Air Transport touse their Viscount aircraft, instead of the older and less economic Vikings,on their Colonial Coach services to Africa.2.     One of the recommendations of the Council was that, on the existingColonial Coach routes to East and Central Africa, air work and Hunting-Clan should be permitted immediately to substitute for their Vikingsmore modern aircraft, such as Viscounts and Hermes, provided these were fitted with the maximum number of seats.    air work and Hunting-Clan have now made arrangements for introducing Viscounts on their services to Nairobi and Salisbury.    They were hoping to start the service on 11th October3.   As the Viscount is a comparatively short-range aircraft, thecompanies had made provisional arrangements to operate through egytian territory with a night stop in both directions at Luxor.    They thereforeapplied for permission to make the necessary payments to the Egyptiansin transferable sterling from the No. 1 Special Account - a total ofapproximately  1,600 per week is involved.    The Foreign Office and theTreasury have not been able to agree to this request as the only paymentsat present allowed from this account are Suez Canal dues.4.   This is yet another blow to our policy of trying to encourage theprivate enterprise airlines.    We have considered possible alternativeways of operating the route with Viscounts so as to avoid egytian territory, but I am satisfied that the proposal put forward by air work andHunting-Clan is the only one at present feasible.    There are bothoperational and commercial considerations involved.    A major factor isthe statutory limitation imposed in the interests of safety on the periods of continuous duty which may be undertaken by aircrew.    The  effect ofthis is that, if the Companies are to operate the service to Nairobi with only one night stop, there is no reasonable alternative to their usingLuxor.     Commercially a flight from Benina to Wadi Haifa avoidingEgypt is well beyond the economic range of the Viscount and wouldC(57) 2244th October,1957CABINETCIVIL AVIATION:  INDEPENDENT AIRLINESMemorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation-1-CONFIDENT!!

CONFIDENTIALEgypt is well beyond the economic range of the Viscount and wouldinvolve the Companies in a loss of payload equivalent to about  2,000revenue on each return flight.5.   I am satisfied, therefore, that the Companies have a strong caseon operational and commercial grounds for their proposal to use Luxoras a night stop.6.   I do not  of course, suggest that the Colonial Coach services arein any way as important to the economy of the country as the shipping services through the Canal.    But we cannot overlook the earliercriticisms of the Government on these Colonial Coach services and ifwe now refuse air work and Hunting-Clan permission to stop at Luxor,we shall in fact be nullifying the effect of the concession we made inJune.    I believe very strongly that we must try to do more for theindependent airline companies and it would be most unfortunate if theone major concession we have been able to make were to be renderedineffective by the Governments refusal to allow air work and Hunting-Clan to meet their expenses for the night-stop at Luxor.7.   T would, therefore, like to have the agreement of my colleagues to air work and Hunting-Clan being allowed to operate through Luxor,and, as an exceptional case, to the necessary expenditure being met fromthe No. 1 Special Account.H.V7.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.4th October, 1957.-2-CON HOE NTS AL
