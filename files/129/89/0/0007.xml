THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1957SECRET Copy No-    ^8C. (57) 20713th September, 1957CABINETUSE OF CARS TO TAKE VOTERS TO THE POLLMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. Section 88 of the Representation of the People Act, 1949, restricts thenumber of cars that may be used on behalf of a candidate to take voters to the ,pell^at a Parliamentary election. The 1944 Speakers Conference on Electoral Reform, 1on whose recommendations much of the present electoral law is based, rejected theidea of such restriction, but the Labour Government introduced it in the representation of the People Act, 1948, in response to Back Bench pressure and inthe face of vigorous objection by the Conservative Opposition.2. There is a strong feeling in the Conservative Party that the restrictionshould be abolished. Resolutions to this effect have been tabled at Partyconferences and meetings of the Central Council of the National Union since 1952,and were carried at the Party Conference in 1955 and at the Central Council last march; and in a letter to me earlier this year the Chairman of the Party referred to&quot; ever-growing criticism in the Party as to why action is not being taken.&quot;A number of resolutions have again been tabled for this year&apos;s Party Conference.3. Before the 1955 Party Conference my predecessor submitted aMemorandum (H.P. (55) 58) to the Home Affairs Committee expressing the viewthat there was an overwhelming case for action by the Government to repeal therestriction, but that it might be advisable to deal first with amendment of the lawabout redistribution. The Committee (H.P. (55) 11th Meeting, Minute 5) took theview that, although on merit there were strong arguments in favour of repealingthe restriction, the balance of advantage lay against raising an issue certain to createpolitical controversy, and that it&apos; would be best to concentrate at the party conference on obtaining information on how the restrictions were in fact working in practice and to defer reaching any further conclusions until this had been done.My predecessor spoke to this effect at the 1955 Party Conference.4. Subsequently the Central Office forwarded a report on abuses of section 88at the last General Election based on statements from constituency agents. Out of178 constituencies from which replies were received there was evidence of the lawbeing broken by the Socialists in 63 cases, by Conservatives in 9, by Liberals in 6,and by both or all Parties in 47. It was stated that the existence of the restrictionsled to suspicion and recriminations between the Parties, and one instance wasrecorded where &quot; the Socialist supporters from candidate downwards wereprotesting vehemently against the present law and were saying how ludicrous itwas.&quot; At the North Lewisham bye-election this year the Conservative agent statedthat some 20 cars were used by the Socialists in contravention of the section.5. It is clear that there is a strong case for repealing section 88 on the groundthat it cannot be effectively enforced and is widely disregarded, thus bringing thelaw into contempt. Against this there is the argument, to which my predecessorshave drawn attention, about the need to avoid establishing a process of alteringelectoral law whenever there is a change of Government and to keep it as far aspossible out of the arena of Party strife. I should be the last to minimise the force52242
of this argument; but the fact remains that the present restriction was introduced by the Government of the day contrary to the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;conference and to the strongly-expressed views of the official Opposition; and it isclear that many of our supporters find it very difficult to understand why the present government allow to remain on the statute book a provision without merit and ofshabby antecedents.6. I have considered whether if my colleagues think that the section shouldbe lepealed the repeal could be included in the proposed legislation onredistribution. This would give the Bill a strongly controversial character andwould probably destroy any prospect of dispassionate discussion of the law aboutredistribution. Moreover the two subjects are quite distinct, and to include bothin the same Bill would so enlarge the scope of the Bill as to incur a risk of amendments on such matters as election expenses and election propaganda. Thisis to be avoided, so that if there is to be legislation to repeal section 88 it shouldtake the form of a separate Bill confined to that purpose.7. If we decide to repeal section 88, ought we to tell the Opposition Leadersof our intention to do so either when informing them of our final proposals asregards redistribution or separately? On the whole, I think that it would be advisable to do so as a matter of constitutional propriety, notwithstanding that, inview of what happened in 1948, it would not lie in the mouths of the opposition leaders to complain if we did not give them any warning.8. In the light of these considerations-with which the Secretary of State forScotland agrees I seek the approval of my colleagues to the following points:  (1) We should introduce legislation to repeal section 88 and,(2) We should inform the Opposition Leaders that we intend to do so.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,11th September, 1957.
