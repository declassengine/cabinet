THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1957SECRET CoPy No-C (57) 20516th September, 1957CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSION SCHEMESMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance the Cabinet on 2nd August (C.C. (57) 61st Conclusions) invited me toarrange for the preparation of detailed proposals for a supplementary pensions scheme on a graduated basis on the alternative hypothesis of the inclusion andexclusion of a contracting-out provision.2. This task has involved (i) working out a State system of graduated pensions,and (ii) the incorporation therein of contracting-out provisions. I am muchindebted to the Board of Inland Revenue and the Government Actuary for their help in working out these proposals, with which I should make it clear that theTreasury have not been associated. There has also been consultation on technical matters with representatives of the Life Offices and of the Association of superannuation and Pension Funds.3. I attach as Appendix A to this paper a description of a State graduated pensions scheme, without contracting-out provisions, and as Appendix B adescription of contracting-out provisions suitable for incorporation in the schemeset out in Appendix A. At Appendix C is a comparison of the income andexpenditure of the National Insurance Fund under the alternatives set out in thepreceding Appendices and under the proposals, an outline of which was annexed to C (57) 165.REASONS FOR CONTRIBUTION STRUCTURE SELECTED4. One of the main difficulties which appeared on close examination of thescheme attached to C (57) 165 was the proposal to apply graduation below the&quot; cross-bar,&quot; so as to diminish contributions, as well as above it so as to increasethem. The effect would have been that in 1960 the contributions for workers whoseearnings were below  11a week in the case of a man would be reduced in varyingdegree below the level to which they will be raised next February under ourforthcoming legislation, and in some cases below even the present level. In order,however, to prevent the contributions of workers on the lowest levels of earningsfalling below even those of contributors in Class 3 (non-employed), it would havebeen necessary for such employees (but not their employers) to be compelled afterthe end of the financial year to pay the amount needed to bring the pensionelement in the annual total of contributions up to the standard rate for thenon-employed.5. It would clearly be very difficult to justify to Parliament and to thecontributors increasing contributions by 2s. a side in the Bill to be introduced next session when at the same time putting forward proposals which, in 1960 theearliest date the scheme can be introduced would provide in the case of lowerpaid workers for contributions at a lower level. The increased contribution to beprovided for in next Session&apos;s Bill will be far from popular, and its only defence,
i.e., that it is necessary if increased pensions are to be provided, would be vitiatedif we were ourselves to say that from 1960 onwards there was no need for lowerpaid workers to contribute so much. Clearly strong pressure would developagainst the proposed 17.?. 6d. contribution in the first Bill, particularly against the employee&apos;s share.6. Nor is it possible to disregard the political and administrative compli-cations involved in collecting from lower paid workers the balances required tobring their contributions up to the Class 3 level for the year, which to them wouldbe very substantial sums. This would involve substituting for this purpose the direct collection from them of arrears by my Department for the comparativelypainless expedient of deduction by their employers. The difficulties of doing this in the case of low paid workers who normally live from week to week need noemphasis. Nor would it be easy to justify exacting an additional contribution fromthese workers which would not be matched by a contribution from their employers.A further disadvantage was that, although these workers&apos; superannuation positionwould be safeguarded as a result of the lump sum contribution to bring their annualtotal up to Class 3 level, the fact that their weekly contribution in Class 1 was belowstandard involved their receiving sickness and unemployment benefit at below thestandard rate, and it would appear in some circumstances below even existinglevels.7. For these reasons I therefore arranged for my officials to work out a graduated scheme (Appendix A) providing for a flat rate of contribution at the levelto be indicated by next Session&apos;s Bill, i.e., Ms. 6d. for an adult male in Class 1 andproportionately for other categories up to and at the cross-bar with graduationabove that level only. The National Insurance element in this 17s. 6d. contribution would be divided equally between employer and employee and the existing unequalshares of the Health Service contribution would then be added. In the result,the employee&apos;s share of the total minimum contribution of 17s. 6d. would be veryslightly reduced, and the employees share very slightly increased, from theproposals in next Session&apos;s Bill, but this could be justified by saying that in thegeneral reform it had been thought right to divide the contribution for all theinsurance benefits of the employed class with employers. As 8 per cent, of earnings(4 per cent, a side) the figure proposed in C. (57) 165 produces 15s. lOd. (the amountof the minimum contribution excluding the Health Service element) at a wage ofapproximately  10, I have placed the cross-bar at  10 and retained the proposed 15 ceiling.8. To charge contributions of less than 17s. 6d. for employed men andproportionately for other categories of contributors, as proposed in C. (57) 165would reduce the revenue of the National Insurance Fund by  130 millions a year in 1960-61.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING CHOICE OF scheme. The case for the plan outlined in C. (57) 165 depended to a great degreeon the buoyant reaction of the contribution income under that plan to conditionsof rising earnings and productivity, and the figures there given assumed, inparticular, that the ceiling of  15 a week up to which graduated contributions werecharged, and the  8 a week limit above which graduated pension began to beearned, would be moved up pro rata, without any corresponding increase in basicbenefit rates. Even if this latter assumption were accepted and I regard it asunrealistic, particularly in view of the size of the surpluses shown these proposals,like the earlier ones, would be bouyant in respect of increased earnings, whetherdue to inflation or increased productivity, though of course this would be confined to the income from the graduated portion of the contribution. On the more realistic assumption that basic benefit rates would in fact have to be increased fromtime to time (though not necessarily in direct proportion to earnings) the consequence will be that the flat rate minimum contribution under the proposals outlined in Appendices A and B to this paper will be increased also, with corresponding adjustment of the ceiling up to which graduated contributions are paid. Under these proposals the reaction of the contribution income to increasedearnings would then not be much less buoyant than that under the plan previouslycirculated to the Cabinet. In order, however, to afford a basis of comparison, allthe figures given in Appendix C assume that earnings and benefit rates remainstable and, therefore, those in the last three columns differ from those in C. (57) 165.
10. Taking the broader view, building a graduated contributory pensions scheme on the pre-existing flat rate base, without erosion of that base, enables us if we wish to preserve for some years at any rate a clear distinction betweenthe basic flat rate scheme which is subsidised (by Exchequer supplement and bydeficit financing) and implicitly guaranteed against large rises in the cost of living,and the graduated superstructure where unsubsidised and unloaded contributions will be wholly applied on an actuarial basis to the supplementary pensions. i suggest that there are cogent reasons, quite apart from the need for sensiblecontracting-out arrangements, why we should wish to establish and preserve thisdistinction. Any scheme such as that contemplated in C. (57) 165 which mergesthe basic and the graduated elements of State insurance, so that part of the gradedcontributions has to be appropriated away from graded pensions and in aid of the flat rate pension, is a substantial step in the direction of the Labour Party Planconception of a complete merging of the finances of State insurance, in which thehigher-paid worker subsidises the lower and the State subsidises the lot and guarantees both the basic and the graded pension against inflation. There seems tome to be a serious danger that we should thereby precipitate that further step(viz. the guarantee of the graded as well as the basic pension against inflation) which,by evincing a Government surrender to the forces of inflation, would remove thelast psychological barriers to runaway inflation. If so, this is too high a price&quot;to pay, particularly at this juncture, for the dubious fiscal advantages such a scheme might in certain conditions have over that put forward with this paper. this latter has undoubtedly the advantage in the shorter term. Its yield in contributionsis immediately greater and would benefit substantially although not perhaps equallyby increases in earnings. Moreover, it would leave the way open in future forthe Government, uncommitted, to move either in the direction of a greater mergingof the basic and graded State pensions, or not, as the then circumstances mightdictate. There is also the related point that the necessity for increasing the flat rate contribution whenever pension rates are raised imposes a measure of socialdiscipline which would be lacking from the scheme envisaged in C. (57) 165. Itmust be borne in mind that any scheme in which income reacts sharply to highlyinflationary conditions must, without the sort of restraint which is imposed by the flat rate contribution, positively provoke claims for higher pensions by reason ofthe large excess of income over expenditure which can be generated by suchconditions and which pensioners know to be available.11. The decision to charge a minimum contribution has very important effects on the finances of the scheme. An overload towards back service will then be paidby all contributors and in total the income of the scheme will be considerably increased. The Exchequer contribution would remain at one-seventh of the basicNational Insurance contribution instead of at one-fifth, as suggested in the earlierplan. No overload would be charged on the graduated contributions which thus become capable of presentation as a fully actuarial contribution yielding value for money. The new scheme will have the advantage of appearing to be a supplement to the existing scheme instead of a substitute for it.QUINQUENNIAL CONTRIBUTION INCREASES12. I have considered whether it would be appropriate in view of the contribution arrangements proposed above to impose regular quinquennialincreases on the rate of contribution towards liquidating the back-service liabilities of the flat-rate scheme. In this context increases on the minimum contribution and increases on the graduated contribution present different problems. To increasethe graduated contribution without any corresponding return in pension entitlementwould be open to objection in that after the first five years it would no longer bepossible to claim that the return for the graduated contribution was value for money. There is the further point that persons covered by contracting-out schemes would either have to be made to pay after the first five years a small graduated contributions under the State scheme for which they received no benefit, or wouldbe excused the extra contribution and so avoid a subvention to their flat ratebenefits which they ought to pay in common with persons fully in the State scheme.It seems to me preferable for these reasons not to impose quinquennial increases on the graduated contribution. The same objections do not apply to regularincreases on the minimum contribution; there is indeed a precedent for this in thedecennial increases of contributions without increase of benefits laid down under
SCOPE AND BASIS OF GRADUATED BENEFITS13. The proposals in the Appendices provide for graduated long-term benefits,i.e., superannuation, widowhood over 60, and long-term invalidity (which is, ineffect, a premature retirement pension), but retain at flat rates short-term benefits and benefits for widows under 60. There is an obvious distinction between long-term benefits for permanent conditions and short-term benefits which are intended,in the main, to act as a stop-gap. The graduation of sickness and unemploymentbenefits would raise administrative problems, but the main justification for leavingthem at a flat rate is that the new scheme would essentially be one for enablingimproved pension provision to be made and that, accordingly, the whole of anygraduated contribution which could be reasonably exacted from contributors shouldbe devoted, in the present economic and demographic outlook, to provision for old age. Further, assignment of part of the graduated contribution to short-term benefits might increase expenditure from the Fund in the early years of the scheme by up to  40 millions a year. A further complication is that to make current benefitdepend on earnings in a necessarily fairly remote past period would introduce afurther fortuitous element into benefit calculations. There is also the risk of pressure for the introduction of graduated benefits into comparable aspects of theIndustrial Injuries scheme with a further reaction on war pensions. I recognisethat the T.U.C. attach importance to the idea that all the benefits of national insurance short-term as well as long should be on the same basis, and thatconsequently the Labour Party may be expected to produce plans for relating the short-term benefits also to earnings. But the reasons I have given convince methat we should not attempt to compete in this field.14. . The proposals in the Appendices also do not provide any benefit abovethe standard rate for those widows under 60 who qualify for benefit under thepresent National Insurance Scheme broadly those with children and thosewidowed when over 50. My reasons here are not so much the cost, which would be fairly small, but the difficulty of incorporating &quot; value for money &quot; which I thinkshould be the basis of the graduated contributions and benefits, with the rule whichhas been deliberately adopted in relation to widows under 60 in National insurance of pensioning only those who are prima facie unlikely to be able to compete in theemployment field. I am driven to the conclusion that unless this principle, whichhas now found wide acceptance, were abrogated (at considerable expense), it is notpossible to graft strictly insurance supplements on to the present national insurance provisions for widows under 60.15. The principle that above the level of the standard subsistence provisionit is appropriate for contributors to receive no more, but no less, than a broadactuarial return for their contributions involves a scale of benefits with no weightingagainst the young entrant and with a large number of steps or possible rates ofbenefit according to the contributor^ average earnings and age at entry.Illustrations of such a scale are included in Appendix A.FINANCIAL RESULT OF ABOVE PROPOSALS16. The result of all these proposals which, for the reasons set out above,I believe to be sound would be, however, to produce a surplus in the first year ofthe scheme of about  140 millions.FURTHER MODIFICATIONS OF SCHEME17. This would ensure that the introduction of contracting out would notendanger the finances of the scheme. In our earlier discussions reference wasmade to a guess that contracting out might perhaps at the outset reduce the revenues of the scheme by as much as  50 millions a year, though this would, of course,ultimately be offset by a corresponding reduced liability for pensions.   Apart,the original Contributory Pensions Act of 1925. The scheme in Appendix Atherefore provides for four equal increases in the minimum National insurance contribution at quinquennial intervals, each of which would involve an increase inthe minimum contribution of sixpence a side.
however, from these considerations, a reduction of  50 millions a year in immediaterevenues would still leave the scheme in its new form in surplus in the first yearand for a few years subsequently. The figure of  50 millions is necessarilyspeculative, particularly for the future, and my discussions with those experienced in this field have revealed a body of opinion which considers it an excessive estimate at any rate for the earlier years. In view of this a constant allowance of  50 millionsloss of revenue due to contracting out has been made in the appropriate Tables inAppendix C.18, It is also possible, without occasioning financial difficulty, to make afurther departure from the proposals in C. (57) 165. In that paper it was assumed that the option under the existing scheme under which married women inemployment can come into insurance or not as they wish would be withdrawn.If we were starting de novo I think there would be much to be said for thisproposal to avoid offering an option which is not easy to justify in logic. Butmarried women have had this option since the beginning of the present national insurance scheme. There would be difficulties in withdrawing it at the moment at which, under the new proposals, their husbands&apos; contribution might be being increased. I propose, therefore, to leave this option in being. This would reducethe surplus on the Fund by a further  50 millions a year. This still leaves a surplus in the early years comparing favourably with a scheme starting from a lower base of contributions.19. It will be seen from line 9 of Appendix C that this partially graduated scheme with contracting out is at all points substantially more favourable to theExchequer than the earlier outline plan.20. A further effect of these proposals is to make the whole of thecontributions under the graduated part of the scheme available for additionalsuperannuation provision. At the maximum this leaves a contribution of 45. aweek a side available for superannuation and associated long-term benefits ascompared with 2s. \0d. under the earlier scheme. As a result the maximumadditional pension for a single person comes to 60.s. a week on top of the basic50s. or  5 10s. a week in all  7 married against 35s. a week on top of the samebasic figure, or  4 5s. a week in all  5 15s. married under the earlier scheme.21. The provisions with respect to contracting out are fully set out inAppendix B. As the result of further consideration and of discussions with the outside interests above mentioned, it is clear that it is practicable to provide theright to contract out on this basis in respect of future as well as of existing schemes.Not only would it be unfair and discouraging to initiative to refuse this privilegeto future schemes, but to attempt to do so would also involve much practical difficulty. For example, it sometimes happens that an existing scheme is substantially remodelled and put on a new basis. This may be advantageous toall concerned but the result is something which is strictly a new scheme. It wouldbe quite impossible to refuse the right to contract out to such a scheme if otherwiseeligible.GENERAL POLICY CONSIDERATIONS22. The proposals contained in Appendices A and B, though involving anincrease in administrative complexity and demands on staff as compared with thepresent National Insurance scheme, are practicable. For the reasons which I gaveto the Cabinet on 2nd August (C.C. (57) 61st Conclusions, Minute 4), to which Iadhere, I regard the proposals in Appendix A by themselves as unacceptable on grounds both of principle and of practical politics.23. While the proposals as modified by those in Appendix B do not offendas seriously, by reason of their inclusion of contracting out, against the principlesof our Party, I should be less than frank with my colleagues if, in submitting themto the Cabinet, I did not make it clear that, though in my view they represent thebest way of giving effect to a State graduated scheme, they remain politicallyunattractive. It is not possible in any State scheme of this character to avoidcomparison with the Crossman plan, and we should be deceiving ourselves if we thought that in comparison with that plan these proposals would exercise muchpopular appeal.
24. The Grossman plan, with all its obvious defects, does promise ultimatelyhalf pay on retirement in the long run to the worker in the middle range of earnings.For example, a worker whose average weekly earnings throughout life are  12 aweek would retire when the Crossman scheme has reached full fruition on  7 av/eek. A worker on  20 a week similarly would receive over  9 a week. Thepresent plan offers a pension of  7 a week at the maximum at the end of a fullworking life. Nor is it possible to distinguish these proposals from those in theCrossman plan on the basis that they make greater use of the principles of freeenterprise. They cannot but look like &quot; Crossman and soda.&quot;25. The modest nature of these proposals derives from the dilemma whichfaces a Conservative Government in extending well above subsistence level a State-administered scheme of National Insurance. We all of us desire to keep anygraduated State scheme as small an animal as possible, both because we dislikeintruding further than we must into the sphere of private enterprise and because we fear the extension of State liability, and consequently the field of political pressure, any higher up the pension scale than is necessary.26. The original proposals for a graduated scheme were not put forward by my Department nor primarily as a measure of social reform, but, in my view,derived from the natural desire of the Treasury, which we all share, to see some improvement in the financial outlook of the National Insurance scheme. Theoutlook for that scheme has, however, sometimes been exaggerated, inter alia,through the basing of forecasts on unduly pessimistic assumptions as to the ratesof unemployment. As however the case for a State graduated scheme is in large measure based on financial considerations, the decision to introduce one will be largely affected by whether it is worth while to introduce an unpopular Bill in1957/8&apos;in order to improve the condition of the National Insurance Fund for afew years after 1960. For administrative reasons it is not possible to introducegraduated contributions before that year.27. On the new basis of the 17s. 6d. contibution to be introduced at thebeginning of February, 1958, under next session&apos;s Bill and with the current levelof unemployment, the deficit on the National Insurance Fund falling on theExchequer (exclusive of the  127 millions Exchequer Supplement to contributions)is not likely to exceed  170 millions in 1966/67. In view of the great increase inthe number of retirement pensioners forecast over the next few years, though large,this is not necessarily an unmanageable or alarming figure. And it may well provean overestimate. It is worth recalling that the Government actuary in 1946 forecast the total cost to the Exchequer of National Insurance in 1958 as  191 millions.Despite or perhaps because of the intervening inflation it is now forecast as 137 millions.28. On the other side of the account the Exchequer will from this monthonwards be obtaining an extra  40 millions making  80 millions in all towards thecost of the National Health Service from the contributors to the National insurance fund. In these circumstances a total cost to the Exchequer of the order indicatedin the middle sixties need not necessarily cause us at present very great excitement,particularly when account is taken of the increasing national revenue which themassive investment of recent years entitles us to expect. It is also worth notingthat if provision for the old, the sick and the unemployed were not made through a contributory scheme it would have in practice to be made in other ways involving a larger direct Exchequer charge, e.g., by way of national assistance.29. While therefore in accordance with the Cabinet decision I submit proposals for State graduated schemes of National Insurance, and while the one in Appendix B is, by reason of its incorporation of contracting out, one which itmay well be possible to induce the present House of Commons to accept, I wouldnot wish to leave my colleagues under the impression that in my judgment itamounts on either political or social policy grounds to an effective alternative toCrossman. Such an alternative would in my view have to be based on a greaterreliance on a modern approach to the duty of employers towards their employees(such as is already acepted in respect of one in every three) arid a greater use of the mechanism of free enterprise.J.

APPENDIX AParticulars of Proposed Graduated Scheme(excluding provision for contracting-out)1.   The following is an outline of a scheme on the principles of the precedingnote.Coverage2. The present universal National Insurance coverage for flat rates would beretained. Minimum contributions would continue to be payable by all personsemployed, self-employed, and non-employed, covered by the present scheme at theappropriate flat rates then ruling. Such contributions would give title to thepresent range of benefits at the standard rates. In addition, &quot; employed &quot; persons and their employers would each be liable to a contribution of 4 per cent, of thatslice of earnings lying between the amount to which the minimum contribution is related and a ceiling. This graduated contribution would give title to additionalpension benefits. The National Health Service contribution would be added, asat present, to the whole National Insurance contribution for collection purposes,but would not enter into the financial structure of National Insurance.Contributions3. Minimum contributions. These would be the total weekly rates for national Insurance purposes (excluding the National Health Service contribution which would retain its present unequal distribution between employer and employee) ruling after the approaching increase in benefit rates. This minimumNational Insurance and Industrial Injuries contribution would be divided equally between employer and employee, involving a very slight reduction in the employee&apos;s share as it will be in next Session&apos;s Bill and a corresponding increase in the employees share. This is due to a redistribution of the incidence of the charge formaternity and death grant on an equal basis instead of placing a greater share ofthe cost of these minor benefits on the employee.4.   The following table shows the result:  Table I	Men			Women			Employee	Employer	Total	Employee	Employer	TotalN.I.......... N.H.S.......	s.    d. 7   11 1    44	51.   d. 7   11 0    34	s.    d. 15   10 1    8	s.    d. 6    54 i   04	s.   d. 6    5* 0    34	s.     d. 12   11 1    4Total minimum contributions	9    34	8    2\	17    6	7    6	6    9	14    35. The above contributions would then continue to represent the contributor^traditional share of the actuarial contribution appropriate to an entrant at age 16for the standard benefits, together with an overload towards back-service, andwould be payable at all levels of earnings subject to rules about employmentswhich are subsidiary or too inconsiderable to attract insurance.Graduated Contributions6. The graduated contribution of 4 per cent, a side would begin to be payable on weekly earnings from employment (but not self-employment) above the figuresof  10 for men and  8 for women at which approximately the total minimumNational Insurance contribution equates with 8 per cent, of earnings. this contribution would be payable on the slice of earnings up to a ceiling of  15 a week in the case of men and  13 a week in the case of women. The maximum weekly contribution for the employee, including National Health Service, would thus be
135. 3\d. in the case of men and lls. 6d. in the case of women. Of these maxima,4y. in each case represents the graduated portion of the contribution, and Is. A\d.(Is. O^d. for women) the Health Service contribution.Benefits7. The short-term benefits of National Insurance-sickness and unemployment widows&apos; benefits for widows under 60, Industrial Injuries benefits,and the minor benefits of National Insurance (maternity benefit, guardian&apos;allowance, and death grant) would remain at flat rates in return for the appropriateflat-rate contribution. The graduated contribution would give title to additional benefits on retirement (including premature retirement owing to breakdown in health) on an actuarial basis. A minimum of five years&apos; contributions would berequired; persons reaching pension age within five years after the scheme beganwould receive a refund of the graduated contributions paid by them and their employers unless they continued in employment, in which case they would begin tobe entitled to a graduated addition to their ultimate pension on completing fiveyears&apos; graduated contributions. The pension payable above the standard rate (plusincrements for deferred retirement, if any) would be determined on an actuarialbasis by the graduated contributions paid and date of entry into the scheme. Thefollowing Table gives illustrative examples based on the assumption that the person concerned retires at age 65(60) but subject to adaptation if he continues to workafter reaching that age.Table IIExamples of graduated pension in respect of contributions above the minimum.MEN	Employee&apos;s contribution	Additional pension	Maximum additional	Age last birthday at	per   of earnings	per  1 of average	pension ( 15	start of scheme	above  10 a week	earnings above  10	average	earnings)	d.	s.    d.	5.	d.16    .........	94	12    0	60	017-19        ......	94	11    0	55	020-22        ......	94	10    0	50	023-25        ......	94	9    0	45	026-28        ......	94	8    0	40	029-31        ......	94	7    0	35	032-34        ......	94	6    0	30	035-38         ......	94	5    0	25	039-42	94	4    0	20	043-47         ......	94	3    0	15	048-53         ......	94	2    0	10	054-59         ......	94	1    0	5	060 and over	94	See note	See	noteWOMENAge last birthday at start of scheme	Employee^ contribution	Additional pension		Maximum additional		per   of earnings above  8 a week	per  1 of average earnings above  8		pension ( 13 average earnings)		d.	s.	d	s.	d.16    .........	94	11	0	55	017-18        ......	94	10	0	50	019-20        ......	94	9	0	45	021-22        ......	94	8	0	40	023-25        ......	94	7	0	35	026-28        ......	94	6	0	30	029-32        ......	94	5	0	25	033-37        ......	94	4	0	20	038-42        ......	94	3	0	15	043-48        ......	94	2	0	10	049-54        ......	94	1	0	5	055 and over	94	See	note	See	noteNote. Persons who are within 5 years of pension age at the start of the scheme will have the option of going on in work for at least 5 years and having the appropriate pension, or taking a refundat 65(60).
8. Assuming introduction of the scheme in the financial year 1960-61, the firstgraduated pensions would come into payment in 1965 at a maximum rate (whereearnings had averaged at the ceiling or above since the scheme began) of 55s. Od.a week single, of which 5s. Od. would represent the graduated element. Aftertwenty years, the graduated element would be producing maximum additions of15s. Od. a week (single) to the standard rate and the maximum graduated additionof 6O5. Od. a week for single men would be reached early in the next century.Married Women9. The present right of a married woman in employment to opt out of hershare of the contribution would continue in respect of the whole of her share of theNational Insurance contribution (apart from that portion allocated to industrial injuries) and including the graduated portion, if any. Employers would remainliable for their share of the contribution including the graduated portion to prevent,as at present, discrimination between employees.Financial Structure and the Role of the Exchequer10. The Exchequer would supplement the flat rate contributions as at present,the supplements being at the existing rate of one-seventh of the total contribution.There would be no Exchequer supplement in respect of the graduated contributions.11. Provision would also be made in the legislation for increasing theminimum contributions for National Insurance purposes (i.e., 15s. lOd. for employedmen and 125. lid. for employed women) by equal stages at four quinquennialintervals until they represented 5 per cent, each of earnings of  10 and  8 a week.Each of these stages would involve an increase of Is. Od. on the minimum national insurance contribution divided equally between employer and employee. the product of these increases would be applied towards meeting the emerging deficit onthe flat rate pension. There would be no increases in the graduated contributions for this purpose.12. At the beginning there would, on the above financial basis, be a surplus in the N.I. Fund of expenditure over income (including the Exchequer supplement to contributions of  217 millions) amounting to about  88 millions.Administration13. The collection of contributions related to earnings whatever the scheme by means of the existing stamped card method would be uneconomical becauseof the immense variety of stamps that would be required, and inconvenient to employers. Verification and enforcement of the exact liability would present difficulties and the high value of the stamps that would be needed in the upperranges is open to security objections. The alternative of direct collection ofcontributions from employers at intervals by the Ministry of Pensions would meanduplicating, in large measure, collection machinery already operated by the InlandRevenue. Preliminary examination has shown that, with some expansion of staffs,particularly during the transitional stages, a contribution of the kind underconsideration could be collected by the Inland Revenue machinery in parallel with P.A.Y.E. The clerical work for employers would be balanced perhaps morethen balanced by the relief from the work of buying and affixing stamps. Therewould also be relief of Post Office counter space and staff, and on the stationery office in security printing.14. The great majority of contributors (some 20 million out of 24 million)are within the scope of P.A.Y.E. For the remainder and possibly for some special classes within P.A.Y.E. stamped cards would have to be retained. Those affectedwould be those liable only to flat rates of National Insurance contribution, mainly the self-employed and the non-employed.15. As under any graded scheme, new problems of enforcement would emerge and a review of existing methods of inspection would have to beundertaken, possibly resulting in some addition of staff.16. Problems would arise in connection with workers who have more thanone employer in a week and whose earnings in total came above  10 a week. Insome respects such persons are comparable to self-employed persons.
Statistics17. Important statistical material, used in particular by the government actuary and by the Ministry of Labour, is based on the present system of collectingNational Insurance contributions. Methods of ensuring that this would continueto be available under a graduated scheme are under examination but should not present insuperable difficulties.APPENDIX BAdaptations and Additions required to the Outline in Appendix Ato allow for contracting-out. This Appendix gives an appreciation of the way in which a system of contracting-out from the graduated part of the scheme outlined in Appendix a would operate.2. The basic contributions under the scheme would remain compulsory forall employers and employees (except married women) but where application wasmade in respect of an occupational scheme, whether existing at the change-over ordeveloped after it, and it was adjudged to satisfy certain conditions, the graduatedpart of the contribution under the national scheme, varying according to earnings up to a maximum of 4s. Od. a week on each side would be excused in full.Registration of Schemes3. The examination of schemes submitted for approval would involve bothtechnical and broad judicial considerations. For this reason, as well as to avoid any suggestion that approval was open to political influence or a desire to conservethe revenues of the National Insurance Scheme, the function of examining presentand future schemes and issuing certificates of exemption would be entrusted to anindependent Registrar of Pension Schemes who would be a statutory officialbroadly comparable to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and would have thenecessary technical advice for evaluating schemes. Contracting-out would beallowed only on an application by the employer, possibly in association with theauthorities or trustees controlling the scheme, and would have to be in respect ofall the scheme&apos;s members. Individual members would not have the right to apply for exemption or to opt out of any certificate of exemption granted, but it wouldbe a requirement that any employer making an application should give reasonablenotice of his intention to do so to the members of his scheme, so that any differencescould be resolved by the ordinary process of industrial negotiation.4. In considering applications for exemption, the Registrar would apply thefollowing main conditions, which would be embodied in legislation. The conditionsrelate to (1) equivalency of the occupational scheme to the State scheme&apos;s graduatedportion; (2) solvency of the occupational scheme; (3) preservation of pension rightsacquired under the occupational scheme.Equivalency Contribution and Benefits5.   Under this head the employer making application would have to show:  (a) Either (i) That the total weekly contributions by him and his employees together to the occupational scheme were not less, in relation to eachemployee, than the maximum graduated contribution to the state scheme i.e., 8s.;or (ii) That the overall long-term benefits of the occupational scheme were at least equal to the graduated benefits of the State scheme.
(b) That the employer is legally liable to provide or has provided Either (i) Contributions corresponding in value to at least half the maximumgraduated contribution under the State scheme;or (ii) At least half the cost of long-term benefits on the whole equivalent tothe graduated benefits of the State scheme.6. Test (a) is the crucial test of equivalency. Test (b) is designed to preventthe approval of schemes (they are not thought to be common) for which the employer does not contribute at least the proportion he would contribute under theState scheme with its fifty /fifty distribution. The need for alternative bases of comparison under each test arises from the variety of occupational schemes whichwill be encountered. A simple comparison in relation to minimum contributions would clearly be the simplest to administer, and the alternative is provided to cater for non-contributory and partially contributory schemes which can only be compared satisfactorily on a benefit basis, and certain other types of scheme where a contribution comparison would yield an unfair result. It would not be appliedwhere a scheme succeeded on contributions alone.Solvency7. The condition as to solvency would be deemed satisfied in the case of statutory schemes, and those insured with Life Offices (in respect of whomsafeguards operated by the Board of Trade already apply). No such safeguards atpresent apply to self-administered schemes, and there is perhaps a case on broadmerits for introducing such safeguards quite apart from the need for them whichmust arise if employers operating such schemes are given the right to contract outof the graduated portion of a State scheme. Furthermore, while approval for exemption would not imply any form of underwriting by the State of the relevantbenefits of an occupational scheme, it is desirable to prevent the development ofunsound schemes.8. The Registrar would therefore need to satisfy himself, in respect ofnon-insured and non-statutory schemes, not only, as indicated above, that it wasa bona fide scheme for providing pensions, but that it was financially sound and was so constituted as to be likely to remain so. This requirement could be met byshowing that the scheme was funded in respect of at least the portion put forward as equivalent (see paragraph 5 above) or, if this were not the case, that the employerwas legally liable to make payments sufficient, with the employees&apos; contributions,if any, to keep the scheme solvent on that basis. The Registrar would also receiveperiodic returns (e.g., audited accounts) showing the financial state of approved schemes, and so be enabled to exercise a degree of supervision over their continuedsoundness.9. The administration of rules on the above principles would raise somecomplex problems, which will need further careful study.Preservation of Pension Rights10. Since rights to the graduated pension under the State scheme would be quite independent of any change of employment, an occupational scheme whichwas approved as an alternative to the State scheme, would be required to makesatisfactory provision that if a member changed his employment his acquiredpension rights should be preserved at any rate up to the equivalent of what thecontributions excused could have acquired during a corresponding period of membership of the State scheme. The need to provide at least this measure oftransferability is independent of the more general considerations (e.g., mobility oflabour) which have been suggested, in the Phillips Report (paragraph 318) and elsewhere as making it desirable that pension rights should be transferable to agreater degree than they are at present.11. There are two broad methods of preserving pension rights the paid-uppolicy, and the transfer of a lump sum representing accrued rights from one fund to another but highly technical problems are involved and the exact provisionfor the preservation of minimum rights will need close study with the actuarialprofession, the insurance industry, and those operating privately administered
schemes so as to create as little disturbance of schemes as possible. In certain casesan undertaking by the employer to purchase accrued rights in the State scheme inrespect of a past period of exemption for employees who left might be allowedas an alternative to a paid-up policy (or other form of transfer) e.g., where the periodof service in the occupational scheme had been comparatively short. It would thus be possible to allow employers to require a minimum period of service beforepermitting pension rights as such to vest in an employee a normal provision where such vesting is a feature of the scheme, To purchase such rights in the state scheme the employer would be permitted to apply appropriate parts of any refundof contributions which would normally have been made on change of employment.12. Approval would not be given to a scheme which had less than a minimummembership say, of 5. It is desirable to exclude in this way the very large numberof &quot; schemes &quot; approved for purposes of tax relief and applying to one individualonly or a very small number of individuals in the higher income ranges. Theseare not, in the ordinary sense of the term &quot; occupational pension schemes.&quot; Thereis also the point that if these &quot; special deferred pay &quot; schemes were not excluded,there would be pressure for individual exemptions on personal grounds apart fromoccupational schemes (e.g., in respect of private insurance policies).13. A decision by the Registrar of Pension Schemes to refuse an applicationfor a certificate of exemption might aggrieve not only an employer but groups ofmembers of the scheme. This in the present climate of public opinion suggests forfurther consideration the provision of a right of appeal against the Registrarsdecision not to approve a scheme.Enforcement14. It is envisaged that the Registrar would have an official part to play inthe enforcement machinery of the State scheme. All employers with certificates of exemption would, as part of the continuing condition of solvency, be requiredto satisfy the Registrar periodically that the appropriate, contributions (or equivalent financial subventions from the employer) were being paid into the occupational scheme. Where such evidence was not forthcoming, the Registrarwould be under a duty to make appropriate enquiries and, in default of satisfaction,to cancel the certificate and report the situation to the appropriate Department sothat it could begin to collect graduated contributions under the national scheme.Transitional Period15. The initial work of approving, and in many cases adapting, all the existing schemes in respect of which application for exemption was made (which might runto some thousands) might be heavy, and even assuming that the additional technicalstaffs needed could be collected and trained within two years, it would be wrong to count on this initial work being completed before the assumed commencing dateof April 1960. If the issue of provisional certificates of exemption which could lead to serious subsequent difficulties was to be avoided, it is necessary to contemplate the collection of the State contributions in full, and subsequent refundsto occupational schemes which established the right to exemption. Wheresatisfactory arrangements for preservation of pension rights could not at once be built into schemes otherwise approvable, approval might be allowed if anundertaking to purchase equivalent rights in the State scheme for individuals wholeft during the transitional period was given.

The estimates of contribution income contained in the Table appended to C. (57) 165 were on a basis of a substantial and continued increase in the level of earnings and did not allow for any corresponding increases in benefit rates. As indicated in paragraph 9 the above figures assume earnings constant at theirApril, 1957 level.2. It is assumed that the inclusion of an option to contract out of the graduated part of the contribution, in the case of persons participating in approvedoccupational schemes, would lead to loss of contribution income of about  50 millions a year, which is equivalent to A\ million contributors.  (See paragraph 17).
