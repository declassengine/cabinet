THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE PRINT20th September, 1957C.R.O. Ref.: FE 316/5 Copy No. 2 9INDIA : INTERNAL POLITICAL SITUATIONUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in India to Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations(No. 51. Secret) New Delhi, 4th September. 1957My Lord, Received 9th September, 19571. There has been a shift in the internal political situation in India as a resultof the General Election five months ago. Before the Election the Congress Partygoverned India with comparatively little effective opposition at the Centre and inall the States, although they asserted their authority in Kerala through President^Rule following a period of chronic instability there. At the Election the Partygained another apparently overwhelming victory, being returned to power once more at the Centre and in all the States, except Kerala. In Kerala the Communistsemerged as the largest individual party without an overall majority, and theyformed an administration in coalition with some Independents.2. It soon became clear, however, that the Congress victory was not as great as it appeared. Quantitatively, the Party&apos;s position in a few States besides Keralahad worsened: in Bombay and Uttar Pradesh its customary massive majoritieswere suprisingly reduced, and in Orissa its members were in a minority in thelegislature until they formed a government and then detached adequate numbersfrom the main opposition party to give them sufficient votes to maintain themselvesprecariously in office. Moreover, qualitatively the inefficiency, self-seeking, andcorruption of some State Congress Ministries had been shown up during the pre-election jockeyings for personal and political positions. The voters wereunenthusiastic about Congress. Criticisms of the party had been freely aired, andthere was little of the crusading zeal which had marked its campaign in the Electionfive years earlier as well as throughout its previous political career.3. The reduced fortunes of the Congress were due partly to the &quot; swing of thepolitical pendulum &quot; which has, quite naturally, begun to operate in India; butthey were also a sign that democracy here is growing-up. The voters were in amore independent mood than in 1952, and they exercised their right to expressscepticism about their rulers. The fact is that they sensed that power had in amarked degree corrupted the Congress Party. Many of its secondary leaders had become typical minor Oriental potentates seeking to retain position by graft andnepotism.4. Other defects were revealed, affecting the Central Government as well asState Governments. For example, the Cabinet in Delhi had become a group offamiliar elderly faces, and in the case of some of them familiarity began to breedsomething akin to contempt. Their leadership had lost touch with the youth of thenation. It had even-except to a considerable degree in the dominant person ofNehru become remote from the people generally.5. These defects dawned on the consciousness of the Congress High command and their supporters after the Election. An introspective self-examination began inthe Congress Party which opened their eyes to various weaknesses that had been growing unrecognised and therefore unchecked for some time. Their previouscomplacency was blown to the winds, and was succeeded by a serious loss ofself-confidence. The sensitiveness, emotionalism and volatility in the Indiancharacter all ran amuck, and caused a slip in morale. There has since been somerecovery of a more balanced view, but a i&amp;SS^of self-criticism remains. Led byNehru whose public denunciations of the Congress Party&apos;s faults have beenimpressive the High Command are anxiously reviewing the situation.6. There are in fact other weaknesses besides unfortunate degrees ofinefficiency, corruption and self-seeking in the Congress regimes.  The foremost is52350b
2 SECRETthat the Party has no clear-cut long-term policy on which its members areinstinctively agreed. During the struggle for independence its various elementswere united in striving for national freedom; they might have split into differentj parties of the &quot; right&quot; and &quot; left&quot; soon after 1947, but were held together by the3, hypnotic, powerful leadership of Nehru and Sardar Patel; and now the significantdivisions amongst them are becoming more obvious. The Congress is in fact ratherdistracted internally by divisions of opinion between progressive Nehru-ites on one side, who believe that India should be a modern, secular, industrialised, welfareState developing along up-to-date scientific and socialistic lines; and on the other side a mixture of various conservative groups, some of them Gandhian idealistswho want India to remain a simple nation of self-sufficient villages (un-industrialised,unscientific and unmodern), others capitalists who wish to put severe limits onsocialism and to depend mostly on private enterprise for Indians economic development; and others old-fashioned, unrepentant and even reactionary Hinduswho wish Indian society to be based on the traditional concepts of religion, casteand communalism. These divisions not only cause a certain lack of cohesionamongst the elders who shape Government policy, but also produce a rift betweenmuch of the older generation and the educated younger generation.7. Such are the weaknesses which now confuse the Party, and make it lacka decisive sense of direction and purpose. Nevertheless, its pristine massive strengthas the national movement of the revolutionary era reinforced by its character asthe bandwagon from which patronage is dispensed is far from dissipated.8. The sorry state of affairs sketched above, has been aggravated by thedifficulties in which India now finds itself through (i) its inability to fulfil the promised second Five-Year Plan within a five-year period, (ii) alienation of the sympathy of the Western world, and particularly of the United States and Britain(on whom India depends for help in its present economic crisis) brought about bysome aspects of Indian foreign policy, and (iii) the effects on Indian public opinionof the Delhi Government^ presentation of the Russian and Chinese Communistregimes as &quot; respectable.&quot;9. Associated with these developments is a decline in Nehru&apos;s authority and influence with the public in general and with some sections of opinion in particular.For example:  (a) the President of India and the conservative Hindus defeated his attempt at the time of the Election to replace Dr. Rajendra Prasad (a Hindureactionary) by Dr. Radhakrishnan (in general a Nehru-ite) in the presidency;(b) he is criticised for his weak handling of the States Reorganisation proposalslast year;(c) he is also being partly blamed for the difficulties that have befallen theFive-Year. Plan; and(d) Hindu and other extremists pay little heed now to his exhortations to themto be disciplined, orderly and co-operative.  Violence seems to be onthe increase.10. But the significance of this decline in Nehru&apos;s authority should not be exaggerated. He is less influential than he was, but is still the only national figurewho counts in any pre-eminent way. His power over the nation is immense, andhe could recover most of his earlier prestige if he exerted that power decisively.11. But will he so exert it? Nehru has the defects of his qualities. He isnot a very good Prime Minister in a crisis requiring strong, decisive, ruthless actionoverriding the sentiments of formidable minorities. He too often seeks a compromise that will appease those minorities. There is also a streak of trustfulguilelessness in him which makes him blind to the dubious motives and intriguesof those who appear friends but are in fact foes to his ideas. And his sentimentalattachment to established colleagues makes him incapable of dismissing them fromoffice when the time comes for them to go. He wished to reconstruct his Cabinetdrastically after the Elections, but allowed old Congress comrades to weedle himinto retaining them in the Ministry. As Dr. Radhakrishnan has said to me in a mount of strictly confidential indiscretion: &quot; The greatest weakness of the PrimeMinister is weakness.&quot;
12. On top of all this Nehru is overworked, tired, depressed and at last ageing.He may not have the will to assert himself vigorously.13. If Nehru revives the magic of his leadership, and if the Congress Partylearns the lessons of its loss of popularity, reforms and reorganises itself, and renewsits reputation as the destined maker of New India, there is no reason why they shouldnot recover and win the next General Election five years hence, possibly evenreconquering lost ground in Kerala and elsewhere.14. But will these desirable things happen? If they do not and the Congresscontinues to decline what will happen in India?15. The Opposition Socialists are feeble. This is partly because Nehru hasstolen their political clothes in his &quot; Socialist pattern of society,&quot; partly because etheir leaders are mostly doctrinaire types with little flair for practical political work,and partly because some of them have their full share of the Indian&apos;s readiness to engage in personal quarrels. As a result, they are split into two separate socialist parties which fought each other in the General Election and lost seats which theyshould otherwise have gained. This has shocked them into a move to re-unite, butthis laudable purpose seems doomed to disappointment on account of theirinescapable failings.16. At any rate the Socialists are not at present an effective alternative to theCongress Government.17. The Communists are a more effective alternative. They are comparativelyunited, well-organised and efficient, and are stimulated by a fanatical sense of mission. They also command plenty of money for campaigning, some of whichmay come from foreign sources.18. The Congress Governments organisation of nation-wide welcomes toBulganin, Khrushchev and Chou En-lai helped to make the Communists seemrespectable to intellectual and illiterate voters alike. Responsible leaders of theCongress Party now believe that this was a serious mistake.19.   Above all, the Communists are now in power in Kerala.20. There they are doing things which appeal to a majority of the voters things which the State Congress Government should have done long ago, but whichit failed to do. It may be very difficult to oust these Communists. Amongst other things, they are giving more efficient and less corrupt administration than theCongress gave; and their leaders are setting an overt example in personal austeritywhich seems to make them, rather than the Congress chiefs, the inheritors of theGandhian tradition. This last quality makes a special appeal to the Indian massesand is profoundly important.21. At the same time they are not seeking yet to defy the Central Government,but for the present are working prudently within the Constitution and making apretence of being good democrats. If they exploit their success in Kerala well, theirreputation will grow, their comrades in other States will also gain in prestige, andKerala may become for the Communists of India what Yenan was for the communists of China a successfur pioneering experiment which they will thenextend elsewhere.22. Much will depend on whether the Congress can oust the Communists inKerala before the next Election in a way which weakens Communist prestige. Thiswill need skilful management, for the Communists will try to blame CentralGovernment obstruction, instead of their own&apos; bungling, for any failure in their administration.23. One of the complications of the present situation is that some ministers in the Government in Delhi do not seem to see the need for an early overthrowof the Kerala Communists. They have been deceived by the Communists&apos; &quot; good behaviour &quot; and now think that Indian Communism will be different from, and better than, Communism elsewhere! These gullible men have even talkedthemselves into thinking that co-operation between a Congress Government at theCentre and a Communist Government in Kerala is a praiseworthy demonstration of peaceful co-existence.52350
4 SECRET24. Other Ministers in Delhi see the danger clearly, and have their plans fordefeating the Communists in Kerala. Mr. S. K. Patil, one of the &quot; tough &quot; Partybosses, and Mr. U. N. Dhebar, the milder but dedicated President of Congress, havesketched them to me. They depend partly on Election petitions (now pending)unseating one or two Communist legislators in the Kerala Assembly, partly on theprovision of judicious inducements to detach a few Independents from their presentsupport of the local Government, and partly on an expectation that the Governmentwill make mistakes and lose popularity with the voters. By a combination of these processes such Congress leaders hope to rob the Communists of their majority, toget their Government defeated in the legislature, and to establish Presidents rule in its place. The alternative of a Congress Government in the State is not practical politics in the near future, because the local Congress Party is discredited, it couldnot command a majority, and it will need a long period of reform, reorganisation and recuperation before it is capable of taking office again. Nor is a coalitionbetween the Congress and the local Praja Socialist Party likely to materialise. Tomeet this situation, S. K. Patil has told me that if the Communists fall in Kerala,the Central Government will amend the Indian Constitution so that Presidents rule in a State shall continue, not for a maximum of three years (as provided at present),but until the next normal General Election without interruption by an interimState Election.25. I should feel more confidence that these Congress hopes might be realisedif the Congress leaders in Kerala showed any sign of being able to exploit the oneor two mistakes which the Government there have already made. In the absenceof effective political opposition the Communists may be able actually to increase their hold on the electorate. Their superior powers of organisation may make their position virtually impregnable. But these are early days to form any firmconclusion. The new Kerala Education Bill, which has aroused the opposition ofthe Churches in this almost one-quarter Christian State, may prove to be the communists&apos; first self-damaging mistake. Moreover, Congress Party bosses of thePatil type are not without the guile and resource necessary to achieve their ends.26. Is Indian national character such that it can face and survive the economicand political crises which are likely to arise as a result of these and other circumstances in the next few years?27. Most of India&apos;s hundreds of millions of people are poverty-stricken,illiterate and ignorant of public affairs. They are not united by any one language,religion or culture, but are divided between many of all these. Yet they aresomehow inspired by the idea of &quot; Bharat &quot; (India), they are patient, submissive anaobstinate, and so far through the ten years of independence they have maintaineda remarkable creative national unity. The reason has been patriotic leadershipby Nehru and uniformity of administration by the Congress.28. Nevertheless, fissiparous tendencies are at work. Deep historicaldivisions, language divisions, communal divisions, caste divisions, and the innateIndian tendency to quarrelsomeness are threatening to undermine the structure ofthe nation. They may break the effective unity of India, or at least hamper fatallythe difficult but essential transition from an ancient, primarily Hindu form of social and economic organisation to something more modern and capable of facing theharsh tests of the present-day world.29. The right answer to this supreme Indian problem is inspired leadership leadership with a clear national purpose and a clear idea of the means of attainingthat purpose. And the leadership will need the backing of a country-wide political party extremely well organised to muster effective majorities amongst some200,000,000 qualified voters in the Union and the States.30. The only possible available leadership of the quality required in the nextfew years seems to be Nehru&apos;s. In spite of his defects, some of which I have mentioned, he is a national statesman of genius. His actions during the last thirty-five years have given him unparalleled prestige amongst his countrymen, his powerover them is still titanic, and they will follow him if he gives an unfaltering lead.Though his gifts lie more in the field of thought than of action, nevertheless his ideasare refreshing, potent and dynamic in contemporary India. He is the driving forcebehind numerous modern notions which are responsible for India&apos;s measure of
progress during the last decade, such as the successful exercise of parliamentarydemocracy, the creation of a secular state in which Hindus, Muslims, christians and others live without fear or favour in partnership together, the slow but steadyuplift of conditions in millions of peasant villages by agricultural and rural reforms,and the planning and execution of ambitious schemes of industrialisation. Withremarkable courage, but (it may turn out) less permanent success, he has attackednot only Asian tendencies to accept bribes, promote relatives and work slackly, butalso all sorts of archaic Hindu religious and social customs which bind India to acrippling past. He remains by far the most enlightened and inspired champion ofprogressive principles and practices. The task of governing nearly 400,000,000&quot; backward &quot; but awakening people by democratic means is extremely difficult, andit might prove impossible in India without a Nehru.31. But in spite of his greatness, by himself he is of course hopelesslyinadequate to the situation. His weaknesses need supplementing by other men&apos;sstrengths. He must be the head, and they must provide the body and limbs of thegovernment of the Indian Union. Such men exist: able, strong-willed, authoritarianMinisters like Pandit Pant, Morarji Desai and S. K. Patil. Other characters likethe prudent party manager Dhebar and the intellectual, philosophical Vice-President Radhakrishnan, and of course the team of able civil servants bequeathedby the I.C.S., will play their parts.32. It is not impossible that at some stage in the political evolution of the nextfew years Nehru will retire to perform lofty extra-government services as thenation&apos;s elder-statesman, whilst one of the &quot; strong men &quot; takes over the CentralPremiership. This might have some advantages, but also some disadvantages fromthe point of view of good government; but it is too speculative a possibility onwhich to base any considered judgment now. In any case, the only alternatives to rule by Nehru&apos;s team or some such substitute are probably government by the hindu reactionaries on one side or by the Communists on the other. It is in theinterests of the rest of the Free World, as well as of India itself, that the congress leaders should continue in power in Delhi and in the various States: and therefore that the present Government should get all the friendly support that is needed notonly from inside but also from outside India.33.
