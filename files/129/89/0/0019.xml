secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1957Copy No.C. (57) 2194th October, 1957CABINETEUROPEAN FREE  TRADE  AREA:  AGRICULTURENote by the Paymaster-GeneralThe attached memorandum by officials sets out proposals which the UnitedKingdom representatives might make in the field of agriculture at the meeting ofMinisters of member countries of the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.) which is to be held in Paris from 16th to 19th October todiscuss the European Free Trade Area project.2.   I comment on the note in my memorandum C. (57) 222.R. M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,3rd October, 1957.
EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA: MEETING OF O.E.E.C. MINISTERS AGRICULTUREMemorandum by officials in preparation for the meeting of O.E.E.C. Ministers in October on the free trade Area we submitted to Ministers in August a memorandum on agriculture.This indicated what action we could take within the limits of existing policies and commitments to deal with the preoccupations of our partners in the free trade Area negotiations. That memorandum was discussed in Cabinet on27th August (C.C. (57) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 1) and there was generalagreement that the approach outlined should form the basis of further study.2. This memorandum has been prepared in the light of that discussion. it proposes the line which we should take at the forthcoming meeting of O.E.E.C.Ministers in order to achieve our objective of getting the negotiations for an industrial Free Trade Area effectively started., . 3. We have borne constantly in mind that the further we move at the Octobermeeting the less we have to play with in actual negotiation later on and the furtherwe shall ultimately be pushed. We must clearly move in this matter, but wemust not move one step further at this meeting than is absolutely necessary in orderto start off serious negotiation on the Free Trade Area.4.   Any move which the United Kingdom makes must take account of: (a) The need for us to provide some quid pro quo on foodstuffs to Continentalfood exporting countries who open their markets for industrial goods to us.lb) The need for those Continental food exporting countries who are not members of the Common Market to safeguard their interests in the markets of the Six Powers.Formally this could be done in either of two ways:  (i) There could be an Agreement (or Statute) for Agriculture along the lines of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and thereforeproviding amongst other things for the elimination of tariffs and quotas and for a common agricultural policy decidedultimately by majority vote. To such an Agreement we couldnot subscribe. But we could offer to enter into some sort of formal association, providing machinery through which it wouldbe possible for the United Kingdom in future to join in specificcommodity arrangements for particular commodities.(ii) There could be an Agreement (or Statute) for Agriculture settingup an institutional framework which would provide for theworking out of precise obligations, though it would notnecessarily involve any prior commitments. To such anAgreement we would subscribe so long as our freedom of action was not restricted by majority voting.While in the end the practical results of these two methods might be much thesame, it is pretty clear that the former approach (4 (i) above), offering no certainty of participation by the United Kingdom would be insufficient to break the log-jamin Paris.5. We must therefore follow course 4 (ii). This means, at least, that we mustdeclare our willingness to participate in the negotiation of an Agreement for agriculture as a complement to the Free Trade Area Convention, which, thoughseparate, would be signed simultaneously with it in O.E.E.C. It seems unlikely,however, that a simple declaration alone could satisfy Continental Europe thatwe meant business. At the same time, it would arouse grave disquiet in the minds of British farmers on the one hand and of the Commonwealth on the other, lestwe were preparing to undertake obligations prejudicial to their vital interests.For these reasons, therefore, we must also be ready to give some idea of the scopeof this Agreement and of the extent of the obligations we could contemplate,although we should aim to avoid detail.
6. Any satisfactory outcome of the October meeting is bound to provide for negotiations on agriculture pari passu with the negotiations on the Free trade area Convention. This may be played up as a great concession by the UnitedKingdom and for that very reason to cause disquiet in the United Kingdom andin the Commonwealth. Immediately after this meeting United Kingdom ministers will be pressed to explain what they have agreed to, probably by means ofParliamentary Questions. The replies to those Questions must not only be satisfactory to domestic and Commonwealth opinion but they must also be, compatible with, and not calculated to undo the good which will have been doneby, our statements in Paris.The Scope of an Agreement for Agriculture7. At the October meeting we should propose (subject to the proviso madein (d) below), and should indicate the extent to which we ourselves should beprepared to subscribe to, an Agreement for Agriculture on the following lines:  (a) It would cover the whole range of policy affecting agricultural productionand trade.(b) It would provide institutional arrangements of a more positive characterthan those which exist at present for consultation, examination andjustification of national policies on production and trade.(c) It would contain rules for trade in agricultural products based on existingO.E.E.C. and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.)obligations.(d) It could provide (if other countries wished it) for the elimination of tariffs and quotas on agricultural products over a definite period, but theUnited Kingdom would require a waiver in respect of tariffs.(e) It would provide a framework of association in differing degrees andcommodity by commodity with the institutions of the Six.The United Kingdom Line on the Elements of the AgreementGeneral Policy and Institutions (paragraphs 7 (a) and (b) above)8. We should in effect be proposing arrangements under which every aspect,internal and external, of United Kingdom policy and practice in the field ofagriculture could be subject to discussion and examination, along with the policies and practices of other countries. We should emphasise that this would provideopportunities for making a real advance in the development of rational policies tothe advantage of all. We should be very ready to co-operate with other membersof O.E.E.C. in a full examination of how existing procedures might be improved and extended. We should have in mind, for example, confrontation of national policies in the light of annual reviews of production, efficiency and levels ofproduction, and complaints procedures designed to enable members to lodge theircomplaints at an early and effective stage.9. In saying that we are ready to accept more positive institutionalarrangements, we are in effect agreeing to expose ourselves, along with othercountries, to pressures greater than those which can be generated at the moment.The primary issue here is really the extent of the powers which should be exercised by the responsible institutions. The United Kingdom line would be that, so longas there is provision for unanimous decision, we are not averse from institutionalarrangements of a more positive kind that those which exist at present and are ready to explore with other members what can be done to this end if that is thegeneral wish. The question will no doubt also arise whether the necessary arrangements could best be achieved by modification of existing institutions inO.E.E.C. or the creation of new ones. We have an open mind on whether it wouldbe better to adapt existing institutions or to create new ones within O.E.E.C.; thiswould be a matter for detailed negotiation. Though they are not matters on whichwe should take any initiative we could, if there were a general feeling in that direction, agree to consider provision for majority recommendations, i.e.,recommendations which though not enforceable, would show clearly the strengthof opinion; and we could adopt an open-minded attitude about the form of the managing body (i.e., Board or Commission) without prejudice to what might be best for the Free Trade Area. &apos;-SECRET
Tariffs (paragraph 7 (d) above)10. If other members of O.E.E.C. wish the Agreement to include preciseobligations for the progressive reduction and elimination of tariffs, we should not object provided it was clearly understood that we should not be able to accept suchobligations and would have to have a waiver in respect of such provisions. Weshould, of course, not expect to benefit from tariff reductions made by others inpursuance of obligations in respect of which we had a waiver, e.g., UnitedKingdom exporters of confectionery would not benefit unless it proved possible to define agricultural products in a way which excluded manufactured foodstuffs. Weshould justify our need for a waiver on the well-known position, which we believeis generally accepted, that we cannot take action which would in any way prejudice the position of Commonwealth export of foodstuffs to our market.11. We may well be pressed to agree to accept obligations to reduce andeliminate tariffs on items in which the Commonwealth has no significant interest.To this we should say that, while we are perfectly ready to discuss all aspects ofour tariffs on foodstuffs in the context of what other countries may be willing to contemplate in this field, and indeed should welcome an opportunity of explaining the importance and extent of the Commonwealth interest, this willingness to take part in the discussion must not be interpreted as implying that we are prepared nowto contemplate accepting any commitments in respect of our tariffs on foodstuffsin the Agreement for Agriculture.Quotas (paragraph 7 (d) above)12. If other members desire that the Agreement for Agriculture should contain a firm obligation to remove all quotas on foodstuffs, the United kingdom should make it clear that we stand by our existing obligations which we have withother members of O.E.E.C. under the Code of Liberalisation and the G.A.T.T.There are a very few cases where the removal of quantitative restrictions will bevery difficult for us and we do not at present see how to do it. There may be caseswhere we, like other people, shall not be able to abolish quotas unless some alternative form of regulating the trade a &quot; managed market&quot; can be worked out, but in this we believe our position is no different from that of anybody else.Association with the Managed Market of the Six (paragraph 7 (e))13.   We would draw the attention of Ministers to the following points:  (1) The Six have assumed that it will be necessary to work out managedmarket techniques for at least some and probably most commoditiespari passu with the abolition of tariffs and quotas. They have established machinery to enable them to do this.(2) Other members of O.E.E.C. (e.g., the Danes) may feel likewise that theycannot contemplate obligations to reduce tariffs and quotas unlessmanaged market techniques for all the commodities where they wishto protect their domestic production can be worked out.(3) The Six,will probably be unwilling to extend the benefit of their reductionof tariffs and quotas in the foodstuffs field to other members ofO.E.E.C. unless they are prepared to participate in the working out ofthe managed market.14. It follows that the United Kingdom line should be that we are notprepared to agree in advance to work out managed market techniques. We havegrave doubts whether satisfactory schemes, schemes which are not more protectivethan the tariffs they would replace, can in practice be devised for all commoditieswhere we and other countries wish to protect domestic production. That is why we cannot agree now to abolish tariffs even where there is no significantCommonwealth interest. But we are willing to examine the problem case by case as each commodity is discussed and an appropriate technique worked out, andif we find that it is advantageous or sensible for us to take part in such managedmarkets we shall be ready to do so. But this must all be in the future and therecan be no commitment now. (There are some cases, e.g., apples and pears, wherea managed market technique, covering not only Europe but the Commonwealth,may be the only satisfactory method of organising the trade.)
Membership of the Agreement. 15. We do not want argument on whether a country should be allowed tojoin for agriculture if it does not also accept the Industrial Free Trade Area andany other obligations. The fact that the Agreement and the Free Trade AreaConvention would be separate should help. Our line should be that the agreement would be open to all O.E.E.C. members. We assume that in fact all members ofthe Free Trade Area would belong and. we ourselves certainly would if it were of the kind outlined in paragraph 7.Commodity Coverage of the Agreement16. We have said hitherto that commodities in Chapters 1-24 of the BrusselsNomenclature must be excluded from a Free Trade Area. The implicationtherefore is that an Agreement for Agriculture would cover this range. The Treatyof Rome, however, has a somewhat different division, e.g., its agricultural provisionsdo not cover manufactured foodstuffs.17. It will be necessary to examine further the problem of what, if any,provisions for tropical products should be included in the Agreement. A separate memorandum bearing on this question is being submitted to Ministers. TheUnited Kingdom line on both these points should be that the precise scope of thenew Agreement is a matter for detailed discussion in which we are ready to join.Quid pro Quo for United Kingdom Waiver on Tariffs18. If we receive a waiver on tariffs we shall certainly be pressed to make some statement regarding the continuance of a liberal United Kingdom importpolicy for foodstuffs. It would be undesirable to make any definite statement atthe forthcoming meeting, but we might indicate that we were prepared to consider making some such statement if other countries so desired.Action After the October Meeting of Ministers19. If the Ministerial meeting in October is successful, negotiations will startalmost immediately thereafter in the special Free Trade Area Committee whichwill have been established. Either in that Committee, i.e., between Ministers, orin the Working Party of officials dealing with agricultural questions, more detailed discussion of the content of the Agreement for Agriculture will take place.20. While the proposal that an Agreement for Agriculture on the lines suggested in paragraphs 7 to 16 above will give a reasonable prospect of getting thenegotiations started, it is possible that it will not be sufficient to secure final agreement to a Free Trade Area. It may be that for this further action on the&quot; foodstuffs &quot; sector will be needed. Whether such action should take the formof specific concessions on individual products to satisfy requests of particular countries or more generalised commitments, it will almost certainly call for some modification of existing policies. The Annex indicates the possible areas in whichwe might be pressed to make further concessions. No decisions are needed in this field yet.Recommendation21. We recommend that at the Ministerial meeting in the middle of october the United Kingdom should propose the negotiation of an Agreement for agriculture on the lines elaborated in paragraphs 7 to 16 of this memorandum.
ANNEXFURTHER STEPS IN agriculture the proposed approach in C. (57) 188 was devised as the maximum offer whichthe United Kingdom could make consistently with present policy and commitments.The substance of the present covering memorandum is on the same basis. Wecannot say whether concessions beyond those limits will be necessary.2. The purpose of this Annex is to indicate the areas in which we might be pressed to make further concessions on agriculture, the changes in policy whichthese would involve and, very broadly, their likely effects. We do not recommend to Ministers that any such concessions should be decided upon now nor that anyshould be made at the mid-October O.E.E.C. meeting.3.   The areas in which we might be pressed are:  I. Tariffs(a) Where there is little or no Commonwealth interest.(b) Where there is a real Commonwealth interest.(c) Other possibilities.II. Agricultural Policy(a) Adherence to a common European agricultural policy to be laiddown in the Agreement for Agriculture, and to institutionsempowered (as in the Rome Treaty) to work in due course by majority decisions.(b) Particular unilateral commitments on aspects of United Kingdomagricultural policy.I. Tariffs4. Because the core of a Free Trade Area Convention (as of the Treaty of rome) is the elimination of tariffs it is reasonable to expect pressure to be particularly severe in this area. The notion of a comprehensive waiver for theUnited Kingdom from the tariff provisions of the Agreement for Agriculture willbe most unpalatable to certain O.E.E.C. countries who will urge that there must,be some multilateral obligation on tariffs, howsoever hedged.5. In considering this question we have sharply to distinguish between the tariffs on the main farm products and those on horticultural products and fish. Themain farm products are protected by the price guarantees, and the elimination ofthe few and small tariffs on these would mainly affect the Commonwealth.Conversely, the horticultural and fish tariffs are of much less interest to theCommonwealth, but are the home producers&apos; principal protection. The Common-wealth argument is understood though not necessarily accepted in Europe.Pressure will be most severe in respect of the tariffs which wholly, or in the main,protect United Kingdom producers.Domestic Considerations6. The difficulty in reducing or eliminating tariffs of domestic interest(horticulture and fish) is mainly political, though the economic consequences for particular producers, as in the industrial sphere, could be severe. In so far aswe could adopt arrangements of equivalent protective effect, the political andeconomic difficulty of reducing tariffs would be the less. The Treaty of Romeenvisages the widespread use of alternative protective devices (e.g., minimum price arrangements, State and quasi-monopoly trading, &amp;c.) during the transitional period and possibly thereafter. But such alternatives conflict sharply with ourcurrent general trade policies. Once we had embarked upon the techniques ofthe &quot; managed market&quot; there would be strong pressures from all suppliers athome and abroad to apply them widely to the detriment of consumers, to ourcost structure, to the terms of trade and so to the balance of payments.SECRET52336 b 3
7. It may be convenient, as the proposed Agreement for Agricultureenvisages, to consider particular arrangements, e.g., minimum price schemes for two or three horticultural items, but general commitments in this field which might involve not only import but production quotas, international producer &quot; cartels,&quot;&amp;c, would be very damaging. In any event, to limit the removal of tariffs by theUnited Kingdom to cases where alternative protection can be afforded would notbe regarded as an equivalent. It would be much less far reaching than the RomeTreaty in which the irrevocable commitment appears to be to remove the tariffsirrespective of whether a managed market can be organised or not.Elimination of Tariffs where the Commonwealth Interest is Small8. The area of possible action is limited. Even if the O.E.E.C. countries are prepared to grant us a waiver in respect of foodstuffs with a Commonwealthinterest, they are most unlikely to give us unfettered freedom to say what thosefoodstuffs are. The total value of United Kingdom imports of &quot; foodstuffs &quot;from all sources (except the Channel Islands) in 1956 was  1,623 millions, of whichO.E.E.C. countries accounted for  307 millions. Corresponding totals were 175 millions and  123 millions for those product groups where the Commonwealthinterest might be defined as &quot; small &quot; on the grounds that it was under 10 per cent,of our imports of the particular products. (The Appendix gives details of our tradein the thirty items of the Brussels Nomenclature affected.)9. Dried and salted meats (almost entirely bacon) account for about 58 percent, of the O.E.E.C. interest: it should be noted that the question of the exchequer subsidy will be a determining factor in deciding whether or not to remove the tariff on bacon. Fresh and chilled vegetables are the next largest item ( 20-4 millions from O.E.E.C. countries), followed by fresh fish ( 7f millions). Other items are small and a number of them are manufactured foods. This is, however, a purelystatistical comparison: in some of these commodities Commonwealth countries might reasonably regard themselves as having a significant interest (e.g., canadian  bacon). Moreover, an item, or items, which are not in themselves large, may beof substantial importance in the trade of an individual Commonwealth country.On the other hand, there are commodities where the Commonwealth suppliesmore than 10 per cent., but where a change in existing arrangements would notcause them harm. If we decided to move in this field of tariffs, there would clearly have to be considerable discussion with the Commonwealth.Tariffs where there is a real Commonwealth Interest10. The Government have declared their intention fully to protect theCommonwealth position in the United Kingdom market. While this attitude is partly governed by our desire to maintain good relations with commonwealth countries, it stems mainly from our wish to retain our preferences in Commonwealthmarkets.Other Possibilities11. In the tariff field there are two possible concessions which, though going beyond present policy, would have no adverse effect upon the Commonwealth, andbut limited effect upon home producers. These are: (a) the binding, at their presentad valorem incidence, of all items in the United Kingdom agricultural, horticultural,and fish tariffs, which are of significant interest to other members of the Free trade area; (b) reduction of wine duties. The former would modify horticulturalpolicy. Tariffs on these products are the counterpart of the guarantees on themain farm products and in principle therefore the possibility that tariffs may beincreased is implicit in current policy. Any tariffs bound in the interest of Europeansuppliers would similarly be bound for all other members of the G.A.T.T.Reduction of the duties on wines would help many European countries and would help the Commonwealth also, except Cyprus. But this would be expensive in termsof revenue, and would give rise to pressure on the duties for other alcoholicbeverages; moreover, any commitment as to the level of such duties would prejudice our freedom of action in a field which is important for the raising of revenue.Predictable Effects of Tariff Concessions12. An essential point to bear in mind is that, over the whole field of tariffs,concessions, if made, are definite and their effects largely predictable.   But the secret
consequences of concessions in the field of general agricultural policy, which are considered below (or of association with managed market techniques.) will necessarily be impossible to evaluate in advance.II. Agricultural PolicyCommitments to a Common European Policy13. This would imply in the last resort and after a period of years reaching a situation in which our farm support and price review policy and our food importpolicy would be subject to European majority vote in the same way and to thesame extent as French and German policies will be so limited under the RomeTreaty.14. It is impossible to say what would be the ultimate economic effects of this,or its bearing on our trade with the Commonwealth: it would of course be a totalreversal of policy and could hardly rank as a &quot; concession.&quot;Unilateral Commitments on Agricultural Policy15. If the United Kingdom were given a waiver from the obligation to removetariffs on foodstuffs the Europeans could reasonably press for some assurances about our food import and production policy. At the least they would want aguarantee that we would maintain our present liberal food import policy when theywere removing their tariffs on our exports of industrial goods. The most we could say within present policies and commitments would be that it was not the aim of ourdomestic policies to increase uneconomically the United Kingdom&apos;s share of her own market. Such a general statement might be insufficient and we might then be pressed for a unilateral undertaking that would involve a change in our domesticagricultural policy.16. Such an undertaking would probably have to take the form of a separateUnited Kingdom protocol to the Agreement providing for one or other of thefollowing:  (a) An undertaking to reduce the level of the guarantees in total if total subsidyexpenditure exceeded a certain amount (e.g., a specified total value, orproportion of national income, or proportion of the value of agriculturaloutput).(b) An undertaking to reduce the level of the guarantees in total if total production exceeded a certain amount (e.g., with the general aim of keeping output within a particular level or the United Kingdom share in total consumption of agricultural products within a particular level).(c) Either in combination with (a) or (b), or alternatively to (a) or (b), a similarundertaking relating to specific commodities of European interest, e.g.,eggs and pigmeat.(a) and (b) above would clearly involve modification of the Governmentsobligations to home agriculture and consequent amendments of the AgricultureActs of 1947 and 1957. Less modification or amendment would be involved if any undertaking were related only to a few commodities. The effect upon farmproduction would depend on the nature of the undertaking, but would notnecessarily be damaging to the economy as a whole. The difficulty of moving inthese directions would be of a major political character.III. Conclusions17. It is, in our view, premature to attempt now to decide which of themore important of these courses might be contemplated. It is manifest that somewould be more difficult than others, economically, politically or both but the areasof difficulty are radically different. Nevertheless, if Ministers had to decide later on that a further major move must be made in order to retain the possibility ofa Free Trade Area it would have to be in one or other of the directions indicated.In order to secure more room for manoeuvre in Europe, the choice must lie broadlybetween the acceptance of difficulties at home, and entering into difficult negotiations with the Commonwealth. If such a move were to be made therewould not be time for a lengthy process of preparation of public opinion eitherhere or in the Commonwealth.
