OIL ALLOCATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy were this afternoon told that, on the latest information available, the majoroil companies expect a reduction in landings from Arab producers of 7 per cent in November and 14 per cent in December.    The minorcompanies, who rely on imports of crude oil and products largely fromRotterdam and Italy, will be more severely affected, and the overallshortfall for December might be as much as 20 per cent.    A 10 per centcut in supplies is equivalent to the consumption of three days1 stocks amonth.    The general level of stocks is about 73 days, though there aredisparities botween different oil products.    A crucial factor is the assurances which certain Arab producers, particularly Saudi Arabia,have given us: if they were prepared to increase their suppHes to thelevel needed to meet winter consumption and increased industrial activity,the position would be much easier, and there might be no need for actionto impose economies in consumption.    But if these promises do not materialise, there is a strong case for some form of allocation.2. in the light of this assessment the Committee concluded thatit would be desirable to introduce arrangements for the reduction of consumption of both industrial fuel oil and motor spirit by 10 per cent.The imposition of the cuts would be accompanied by a publicity campaign to encourage economy in the use of all forms of fuel.3. Since some consumers of industrial fuels must be awarded priority,cuts imposed on others must be higher (around 13 per cent).    This shouldinterfere very little with industrial production.    It is, however, forconsideration whether, taking account of the possible effects of the miners&apos;overtime ban on coal stocks, across-the-board cuts of 10 per cent should beapplied to fuel oil for electricity generation, bearing in mind that, if theyare not, the cuts to other consumers would need to be doubled,    the reductions would be carried out by the oil companies and based on their estimate of consumption during the coming winter; they would be achieved by directions to the suppliers under the Emergency Regulations.

If HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S government cp(73) 126 COPY NO        0714 November 1973CABINETOIL ALLOCATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the council, The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy were this afternoon told that, on the latest information available, the majoroil companies expect a reduction in landings from Arab producers of 7 per cent in November and 14 per cent in December.    The minorcompanies, who rely on imports of crude oil and products largely fromRotterdam and Italy, will be more severely affected, and the overallshortfall for December might be as much as 20 per cent.    A 10 per centcut in supplies is equivalent to the consumption of three days1 stocks amonth.    The general level of stocks is about 73 days, though there aredisparities between different oil products.,    A crucial factor is the assurances which certain Arab producers, particularly Saudi Arabia,have given us: if they were prepared to increase their supplies to thelevel needed to meet winter consumption and increased industrial activity,the position would be much easier, and there might be no need for actionto impose economies in consumption,,    But if these promises do not materialise, there is a strong case for some form of allocation,2,        In the light of this assessment the Committee concluded thatit would be desirable to introduce arrangements for the reduction of consumption of both industrial fuel oil and motor spirit by 10 per cent.The imposition of the cuts would be accompanied by a publicity campaign to encourage economy in the use of all forms of fuel.3. Since some consumers of industrial fuels must be awarded priority,cuts imposed on others must be higher (around 13 per cent).    This shouldinterfere very little with industrial production.    It is, howevey, forconsideration whether, taking account of the possible effects of the miners&apos;overtime ban on coal stocks, across-the-board cuts of 10 per cent should beapplied to fuel oil for electricity generation, bearing in mind that, if theyare not, the cuts to other consumers.would need to be doubled,    the reductions would be carried out by the oil companies and based on their estimate of consumption during the coming winter; they would be achieved by directions to the suppliers under the Emergency Regulations,    The
issue of the directions will enable the oil companies to institutearrangements to alleviate local shortages and to help out those companies whose supplies have been more severely cutc4, As far as motor spirit is concerned, the cut would be achieved by a restriction of supplies to dealers.    It would be advisable to introduceimmediately an order under the Emergency Regulations to preventhoarding.    It would be left to dealers to share out the limited suppliesas fairly as possible, taking account of the needs of essential users suchas doctors.    Unless, however., consumption by motorists can be reduced,cuts in supplies to dealers could not be sustained for more than about threeweeks before shortages became acute.    Some voluntary economies can nodoubt be secured by a sustained publicity campaign, but this is unlikely tobe enough.    We must, therefore, consider other measures to reduceconsumption, such as a compulsory lowering of the speed limit and banningmotoring on Sundays,    But even steps such as these are unlikely to balancea 10 per cent cut in supplies to dealers, so that local shortages would stillbe possible, and public criticism would follow,5, The Committee concluded that, if these measures wereimplemented, it would not at this stage be necessary to take stepsto introduce petrol rationing.    They noted that, although the powerscan be renewed, it might well be embarrassing to us to have to do thisif the purpose were only for oil allocation or petrol rationing.    It would therefore be prudent to secure the passage of the Fuel and Electricity(Control) Bill before 12 December,6, An announcement of these measures would be made in the debate on the emergency powers tomorrow afternoon,7. I invite the Cabinet:-i. To endorse these measures to conserve oil supplies.ii. To decide whether oil supplies for power stations shouldbe included in the cuts.J privy Council Office14 November 1973
