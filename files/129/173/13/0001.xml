OIL SUPPLIES TO CEGB POWER STATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry i. 1% ksi aeceasary to decide  foe extant to ^hich o&amp;l suppose to power stations should be reduced as part of the cuts in oil allocation.2. The Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) have informed us that taking into account the terms of their existing commercialagreements with a number of major oil companies and the reduced takefor this year negotiated last Spring to accommodate the support for coalagreement requested by the Government, the CEGB could not rely, forthis winter, on receiving more than 70-72 per cent of the oil suppliesdelivered last winter.    This effectively means that they have arrangeda cut back in fuel oil consumption by 28-30 per cent as compared withthe same period last year.3. The Minister for Industry has given instructions that, save for10, 000 tons a week, coal exports should be stopped; that there shouldbe the maximum lift of coal from pit-head stocks to power stations,and that the British Gas Corporation should supply the maximum practicable quantity of gas to the power stations.4. The coal stock levels at power stations shown in the annex to this paper take account of these measures and the amount of imported coalthe CEGB expects to receive by end January 1974.    The annex indicates,on alternative assumptions of 20 per cent or 40 per cent loss in coal production due to the miners1 industrial action, the remaining endurancefrom end January 1974 of coal stocks at expected burn rates in normalwinter conditions.    The table also indicates the time in weeks from theend of January before disconnections have to be made at peak periods.From that point to the introduction of severe rota disconnections knownas SOLDER (see paragraph 8 below) is a short time - perhaps a week to10 days.5. The estimates of endurance could vary, depending on the weatherby * 1 week.1CP(73) 133 COPY NO   n n30 November 1973CABINET
6. It will be seen from the annex that if the CEGB&apos;s oil supplies are cut by 30 per cent, coal stocks will fall to the point at whichdisconnections become inevitable by end-January (with 40 per cent coaldeficiency) or mid-February (with 20 per cent coal deficiency).    Areduction of the CEGB3s oil supplies by 13 per cent instead of 30 per cent would delay the need for disconnections by 1 week.7. When national stocks of fuel oil reach the 45 day level,distribution problems can be expected to leave pockets of consumerswithout supply for a period.    These difficulties will worsenprogressively as stocks fall.    On the present assessment of supply,the 45 day level will be reached by about early March if:either   iP   the CEGB received the same oil supplies as last year and non-priority users of oil had a 30 per cent cut;or        ii.   if CEGB supplies were reduced by 30 per cent (as comparedwith last winter) and all other consumers&apos; except public transport by 13 per cent.    (Roughly the existing cuts).This same level of fuel oil stocks would be reached by early February,if CEGB oil burn and that of other consumers were both reduced by13 per cent (as compared with last winter), thus approximatelycoinciding with the critical point in CEGB coal stocks (paragraph 6).8. The action of the EPEA also needs to be considered, for theirban on out-of-hours working means that the rota cut system which wasoperated in February 1972 could not be repeated.    The same selectivityand protection for priority users would be impossible.    The much cruderdisconnection system which would have to be operated (known asSOLDER) would, as reported to Cabinet on 13 November (CM(73) 35thConclusions, Minute 2), lead to widespread disruption of supplies.This situation could result from a prolonged miners&apos; overtime ban alone,A superimposed switch from oil to coal for electricity generation wouldadvance the date at which it would occur.    However, SOLDER wouldprobably not need to be introduced until the peak period disconnectionsmentioned in paragraph 4 above became severe and regular.COURSES OPEN9.        These are:i.     to allow the CEGB to accept a 30 per cent reduction intheir oil supplies as compared with their consumption last winter.    This would mean, assuming a 40 per cent cut in coal production, that we could face load disconnections byend January;2
ii.     to make arrangements with the oil companies to ensurethat the oil supplies to CEGB are not reduced by more than13 per cent as compared with last winter!s consumption.This would delay the need for disconnections by 1 week;iii.    to direct the oil companies to deliver to the CEGB thesame quantity of fuel oil as was consumed last winter.This would add another week!s endurance to power stationsbut could mean cutting non-priority oil users by 30 per cent.10.       The supply position of middle distillates is easier than that of fuel oil.    The CEGB and the oil companies are examining urgently thepossibility of extending the endurance of their system by increasingthe use of this   oil in the power stations.    If the technical feasibility of such a course is   established, thi3 issue will be the subject of separate recommendations.    The need for an immediate decision on fuel oil supply is not affected.11.       Measures to restrict electricity demand and so extend theendurance of the system are also under urgent consideration and will bethe subject of separate recommendations.RECOMMENDA TIONS12.       I invite the Cabinet to agree that:i.    In view of the very low level of coal stocks which wouldresult from the CEGB accepting a fuel oil cut much higherthan 13 per cent, action should be taken at once to ensurethat oil supplies to the CEGB are not reduced by more than13 per cent as compared with the corresponding period lastyear, with the existing oil cuts on other consumers.ii. This allocation in CEGB oil supplies should be reviewedweekly at least in the light of the developing situation in coalmining, electricity generation and oil supplies.P V/Department of Trade and Industry30 November 19733
