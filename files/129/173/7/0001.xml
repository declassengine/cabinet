RATE SUPPORT GRANT (ENGLAND AND WALES) -TOTAL OF grant memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At its meeting on 8 November (CM(73) 54th Conclusions, Minute 2)Cabinet agreed that I should now undertake consultations with localauthorities on the basis of the recommendations in my paper CP(73) 123,on the basis of accepting as relevant expenditure the forecast for 1974-75,but reflecting in full the reductions of  81 million which the Governmenthad announced earlier in the year.    It was also agreed that it was undesirable that the average domestic rate burden should increase by morethan 7 per cent.    This, after allowing for the agreed variable domesticrelief with a JOp minimum, would lead to an Exchequer grant of 59. 8 per cent of total relevant expenditure.    Cabinet, however, wished to be informed ofany eerious anomalies which came to light in the course of discussions withthe local authorities,2. My officials met the representatives of the local authorities on  0 November.    This memorandum reports the outcome of discussion on thetotal of relevant expenditure, grant distribution and the percentage levels of granto    I will now have to negotiate the final statutory settlement withthe local authoriti.es on 27 November,    I seek authority for the line I wishto take at this meeting.3. The local authority representatives argued that our proposals tosecure the full effect of the  81 million cuts were harsh and would requirequite clear and specific policy changes, which would have to be announced.They pointed out particularly that since in some services the latest forecastswere now below the level on which the  81 million cuts were originally based,higher cuts would be needed to produce the full  81 million on other services, in particular the personal social services, and education services.They stressed that the growth rates in many of the services reflectedcommitments already made, in many cases .as a result of Governmentpressure.    In these circumstances, the local authorities doubted whetherthe required savings could be achieved.    In particular they queried whetherthey could secure the  10 million efficiency cuts on top of the identifiedsavings of  71 million.    My officials stood firm on the necessity for1CP(73) 127 COPY NO      G 721 November 1973CABINET
achieving the full  81 million cuts0    They assured the local authorities thatit was proposed that a circular should be issued by the Ministers concerned,drawing attention to the need to restrain expenditure and indicating the types of choices between different programmes which would have to bemade to ensure this end,4c Local authority representatives saw little to justify a special &quot;west midlands factor,,    In particular, they had doubts about a West Midlandsfactor which applied to the counties round the West Midlands metropolitancounty but not to metropolitan co\znty itself.    Broadly the local authorities were opposed to any regional factor in the distribution formula, although they recognised the case for the South East,    Their criticism does raisethe issue of whether we should continue with a factor for the West Midlands.5. The local authorities argued very strongly that the grant we were proposing fcr 1974-^75 was not sufficient to keep the increase in domesticrate down to 7 per cento    Their main point was that we had not allowedsufficient for inflation in that period, taking account of potential settlementsfor manual workers.    They said that they would probably rate for an.increase of 13 per cent for the year.    They also said that we were offering a comparatively low percentage grant, and diverting grant into the domesticelement (given the lOp and the variable domestic relief) which was thereforecoming off the total of grant.    They considered that this was unjust on the argument that in the past increases in the domestic element had been accompanied by increases in the amount of grant,    I would not accept thewhole of their arguments.    After all they have been relieved cf having topay for services costing over  300 million.    But in my opinion we have ineffect given the domestic ratepayer an enhanced amount of grant, at theexpense of the non-domestic ratepayer and without any part of this increased burden falling on Exchequer funds,,6, The local authority arguments set out above make a case for anincrease in the percentage of grant.    Our latest calculations of the cost ofthe variable domestic element, which suggest that it will amount to some 30 million more than previously estimated^ tend to support these arguments.    If this increased domestic element is to come out of the totalwe have previously agreed and if we keep the increase in domestic rate burden to 7 per cent, then all of the extra burden will fall on non-domestic rate payers.7. We have therefore a choice between two courses which at the extremecould be expressed as follows -a. We could keep to the total of grant we had previously decidedand reject the local authority arguments and their assumptions aboutinflation.    If we do this then either the rate burden on non-domestic rate payers must go up to something of the order of a 22 per cent increase keeping domestic increase to 7 per cent, or the burden on domestic ratepayers must go up to 8.4 per cent, keeping the burden on non-domestic ratepayers to an increase of 20 per cent,2
bn We could increase the. overall percentage of g;?ant to61 per cent of relevant expenditure as local authorities have asked.This on their assumption about inflation would keep the increase in domestic burden to 7 per cent and for non-domestic ratepayers to20 per cent.    It would not involve any direct increase in public expenditure.    It would however mean a substantial increase inExchequer grant of roughly  75 million.conclusion. I do not consider that we should increase rate burdens in the way which course a. above would involve.    I therefore recommend that weadopt course b. and increase the overall percentage of grant to 61 per cent.G r department of the Environment20 November 19733
