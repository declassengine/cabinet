HOME OWNERSHIP AND HOUSE building memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentL We have taken a number of fundamental measures this year whichshould put housing in the medium and long term on a more satisfactory-basis,    Nevertheless3 for reasons which are extraneous to housing policy,the immediate prospects for 1974 are extremely discouraging,2, During the course of the year we have established a new and more positive role for the Housing Corporation and I am sure that the new driveand increased resources we are putting into it will pay off both in the provisionof houses to rent and in an expanded programme of houses for sale.Lord Goodman has recently reported on his progress.    Similarly we are putting the renovation and rehabilitation of houses in areas of urban stress on a much more satisfactory basisa    In relation to the building societies wehave set up the Joint Advisory Committee to assist in the voluntarystabilisation of mortgage funds and we are on the point of final agreementwith the Building societies Association on the early implementation of the selective scheme for first-time purchasers.    We may therefore claim tohave laid the basis for a healthier housing policy.3, The immediate problem is that a succession of rises in interest ratesgenerally this year, not fully matched by rises in investment rates of thebuilding societies, has resulted in mortgage rationing which could turn intoa famine.    Details for recent months of Building Society receipts and house building, with an estimate of the level of house building for 1974, areannexed.    These figures show that the immediate outlook for house building is bleak.4.        At their meeting on 2 October (CM(73) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 5)th&amp; Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to arrange for a radical study of the longer term problems of housing finance and ways of raising finance for private purchase which will reduce thepresent dependence on small short-term savings.    We are doing this.    But,as I see it, there is now a need for immediate action to increase the supplyof funds for house purchase to prevent a continuing decline in house building.The number of houses under construction in the private sector at the end ofSeptember (255, 000) is the largest ever recorded.    If we can speed up theCP(73) 132 COPY NO      0&apos;3 December 1973CABINET
completion of those houses we should be able to show better rates ofcompletions month by month in the coming year, and perhaps get nearer200,000 completions in 1974.    It should also improve confidence in theindustry 05. Yet another increase in mortgage rates - the fourth in a year -would be politically disastrous.    The Building Societies&apos; Associationthemselves will almost certainly not want to increase their rates unless there is a net outflow of funds, which will force them to do so in order toprevent &quot;a run on the bank&quot;.    That could happen.6. We need to decide therefore whether we attach sufficient priority to private house building to justify taking special steps.    If action is taken,it should be taken quickly.    In view of the problems over public expenditure,I propose that we should try to arrange for additional funds as a stop gapmeasure from the private sector.    There are two possible sources offinance:i. The banks.    While it is clearly important not to divertbank lending from productive investment, I believe we should see how much scope there is for additional bank lending to the building societies for housing.    Lord Goodman has already been exploringbank finance for a Housing Corporation subsidiary and told us on27 November that the banks might have funds available.ii. The insurance companies.    Insurance companies and pensionfunds have a total inflow of new funds of about  2, 000 million a year.Of this, about  200 million is invested in property companies, and 3CO- 400 million in direct investment such as mortgages, loans,land and ground rents.    Without dislocating essential invesfcment,some part of the inflow to insurance companies might be diverted to increase or stabilise their existing house purchase lending, whichhas varied in recent years between  3 million and  82 million a year,TREASURY VIEWS7. The Treasury see no prospect of the banks being able to providefunds to the building societies in present circumstances.    The banks arealready under very severe restraint as a result of the recent monetarymeasures, and have been asked particularly to cut back on personal lendingand property development (other than housing).    Any funds diverted to housing would be at the expense of other investment and exports.    Anyfurther call for special deposits would also put further pressure on interest rates, thus exacerbating the building societies&apos; present problems.8.        So far as the insurance companies are concerned, it would clearly be welcome if funds could be switched from property companies to building societies,    The Treasury doubt, however, whether institutional investorsare likely to provide substantial funds or at rates likely to be tolerable to thebuilding societies.    More important, any diversion of funds to the building societies would probably be at the expense of public sector borrowing towhich the institutions are major contributors, and we should have no meansof detecting this.2

9. Given the competing claims on resources and the current decline in personal savings, Treasury officials would advise against immediate actionto try to divert resources into the housing market.    If mortgage rationingbecame intolerably severe, they suggest that it would be for consideration whether allowing building societies rates to rise would not be less damaging to the economy than attracting funds from the banks and institutionij0REC recommend TION10,        I can of course see the strength of the Treasury objections.    But Iam convinced that the prospect for house building, unless we take some immediate action, is so bad that I must draw it to the attention of Cabinet.I strongly recommend that, despite all the difficulties, the steps described in paragraph 6 should be examined further^    This would involve urgentnegotiations with the building societies and the other lenders on suchmatters as the cost of borrowing, and the duration of and security for the loans.    I recommend that we should go ahead with these explorationsimmediately.G r department of the Environment3 December 19733
1 .   My Department estimate that building societies need to attractabout  &quot;160m or more net new receipts a month (excluding interestcredited to accounts) to support private housing completions of200,000 or so a year.    But net receipts in October were only  90mon this basis.    The figure for November is likely to be no more than about  80m (most of which came in early in the month).    On the basisof last Ttfeek&apos;s figure, and despite the protection provided by thelimitation on rates of interest paid on small bank deposits, the monthly rate is now down below  ^Om, and the receipts for subsequentmonths could decline even further if the competing market rates donot fall sharply and soon.    In October 16,700 houses and flats were started for private owners (3,200 less than last year) and 15*900XvTere completed (800 less than last year).    Taking figures for thethree months August to October, starts were down 11$ as comparedwith 1972, and completions 6f0 down.2.    If the reduced level of private building in October does notimprove we cannot expect private housing starts and completions in197^4- &quot;to exceed 165,000 each, as compared with housing starts of227,000 and 215,000 (estimated) in 1972 and 19 73, and completionsof 196,000 and 185,000 (estimated).    The housebuilders called on theMinister for Housing, on November 27, at their request, to inform him of their view that unless some action is taken we face the worstslump in private housebuilding since the war.(confidential)
