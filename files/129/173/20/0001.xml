THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENTICP(73) 140 COPY NO       g1 &apos;12 December 1973CABINETHOME OWNERSHIP AND HOUSEBUILDINGNote by the Central Policy Review staff. In his paper on Home Ownership and Housebuilding (CP(73) 132)the Secretary of State for the Environment -a, states that housing starts are likely to fall to 165, 000 in. 1974, ie 62, 000 below the 1972 level, and could fall further;b. recommends that further examination shoxxld be givento the possibility of tapping additional funds for housing fromthe Banks and the insurance companies.2. A reduction of this scale would be a major setback to the strategy-set out in the Housing White Paper last April.    Moreover, critics couldclaim that the level of housing starts fell lower than the lowest level inthe years 1964-70 and never was as high as the best achieved in thosesix years.    At this late stage it will be very difficult to devise policies which will prevent a major fall in the programme in 1974 or even in 1975.Nevertheless all possibilities should be thoroughly explored before beingdiscarded.3. The CPRS therefore supports the recommendation at b. above.In addition, the CPRS recommends that two further possibilities should be examined -a.      Raising funds for housing in the Euro-markets.    (this could take the form either of borrowing by a public authorityfor relending to the building societies, or borrowing by theBuilding Societies with Treasury guarantee: it could either bea Eurobond issue - like the recent National Coal Board issue -or a Eurodollar syndicated rollover loan, like the ElectricityCounciPs. )   Eurodollar rates are at present several percentagepoints loweT than British interest rates and with the possibilityof $20 billion of OPEC money coming in may fall further.
b.      The Banks should be asked over a period of months not   !merely to stabilise the level of advances to property companiesbut also to reduce the levels, the freed funds to be lent for housing.4. Like  the Secretary of State, the CPRS is very conscious of thedifficulties inherent in any of these proposals.    It believes, however,that Ministers should have the opportunity of weighing up the difficulties arising from detailed proposals for tapping new sources of financeagainst the social and political effects of a major setback in the house -building programme.    The final decision on what if anything is practicalwill have to be taken in the light of the general economic situation.Cabinet Office12 December 1973
