ENERGY SITUATION:  PUBLIC EXPENDITURE measures memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The country is now facing the gravest economic crisis since theend of the war.    Because of the sensitivity of some of the figures, I willexplain the prospects orally to my colleagues^, but the clear conclusion isthat we must take immediate steps to reduce demand.    This is essential if we are to begin to make some impact on a worsening balance of paymentssituation as well as to restore confidence in sterling which will otherwisecontinue to slide further with the inevitable consequences for import prices,2. There can be no doubt that a substantial contribution to the reductionin total demand must come from the demands of the public sectora    I have on a number of occasions advised my colleagues that, in my view, public expenditure was too high.    It is significant that in 1970 public expenditure as a proportion of national income was 49, 9 per cent (compared v/ith43. 7 per cent in 1964),    In 1974-75, on the original basis of a growth rate of 3j per cent it would have risen to 50 per cent.    With a nil growth rate, the proportion would be 51. 7 per cent0    With a negative growth rate,the proportion will be higher still, unless action is taken.3,        I realise that what I propose will bear very heavily on certainprogrammes, but nothing less than cuts of this order will match the gravity of the situation.    The fact is that since we decided on the public expen-diture programme for the period up to 1977-78 the prospects for the economy, with the onset of the oil crisis, have seriously worsened.Even before, there were already signs of developing pressure on someindustrial sectors, not confined to the construction industry.    It is now clear that the existing and prospective shortages of oil and coal supplies will have serious effects on national production;  so that, depending on the assumptions about energy, there will be nil, or minusp growth next year.Nil growth would imply a shortfall of output - as compared with what wouldhave happened with a 3j per cent growth rate - of about  2-1 billion.    Eachfurther fall of 1 per cent in the rate of growth beyond that would mean anadditional shortfall of output of about  f billion.CP(73) .139 COPY NO       6 /12 December 1973CABINET
4.        We therefore face a three-fold taskr-a.        To cut overall demand to match the prospective loss of output.    This is essential if we are to avoid a massive demandpull inflation.b0 To tailor the cuts so as to place the main weight wherethe demand for energy is high.    There is a much higher energycontent in a million pounds of motorway or of defence equipmentthan in a million pounds of manpower in education or the social services.C        To seek to sustain those activities which make the biggestcontribution to the balance of payments.    This implies that so faras possible essential industrial investment should be protected.5.        Whatever might be the appropriate action at other times, in presentcircumstances it would be wrong to announce increases in either direct or indirect taxation which would reduce real take-home pay06,        Although public expenditure in total was expected to grow by only ,8 per cent next year, the growth of the public sector&apos;s demands for bothcapital and procurement programmes would have grown a good deal faster.This reflects the fact that those programmes which involve heavy directexpenditure on goods and services - eg health, education., roads and otherinfrastructure, and local authority services - were all planned to growrelatively fast.    Defence, which was expected to expand at a somewhatslower rate, also makes heavy demands on resources,, including those used by the engineering and allied industries.7.        In these circumstances it is essential to make a substantial reductionin the demands of the Government and other public authorities for goods and services,,    The present public expenditure programmes were designedagainst a background in which the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1974was expected to rise by 3j per cento    The prospects now are that the GDPin 1974, far from growing by 3j per cent, is likely to fall.    In thesecircumstances public expenditure on goods and services must be re-programmed.    Cuts should so far as possible be directed to those areasof expenditure which use energy.    But with the general threat to employment it would not be appropriate to reduce direct recruitment to the public services.8. What is required therefore, and what I propose, is that substantial reductions should be made in the previously agreed levels of expenditure on capital formation, including both construction work and expenditure onplant, vehicles and machinery; and also on procurement of supplies and services of all kinds.    Exclusions or special treatment should be reducedto the minimum and I propose that they should be limited to investment inthe energy industries themselves, and on the social side to housinginvestment.
9, My proposal is that for all the other programmes reductions in expenditure of at least 20 per cent on capital programmes and 10 per centon procurement etc should now be imposed,,    I suggest a percentagereduction on capital programmes rather than a complete halt in the lettingof new contracts because the former seems to leave some scope for the responsible Ministers to make room for top priority requirements, whereas the latter leaves no flexibility at all.    So far as possible these cuts shouldbe achieved by postponing or eliminating new orders; but we cannot in this situation necessarily avoid some effect on work in progress,, nornecessarily the need to cancel some eontracts, even where a financialpenalty may be involved,,    It is certain that some programmes will inany case slip substantially because of shortage of supplies.    But we must now take action to ensure that the expenditure and demands which thecentral Government, local authorities and some nationalised industries would otherwise have made are effectively cut back; and we must be ableto demonstrate that we have taken the necessary action to this end.10.        In view o  what I am proposing, it may be thought that, in such a grave situation, the production of Concorde should at least be limited to16,,    I understand that we shall have a further report in the next few days;but since consultation with the French would be necessary before anannouncement was made we could not include this in the immediatepackage.    It is for consideration whether Maplin should be furtherdeferred.,11.        Though the energy industries in principle come within the prioritycategory, in practice it is reasonable to reduce the estimates for their capital expenditure to take account of the constraints on the investmentthey are likely to achieve in the new situation,,12.        The output of this group of industries is now substantially under-priced at the cost of a large subsidy bill.    Our subisides to the Coal board are running at  150 million a year, but will double unless we take remedial action on prices.    I propose that as soon as practicable we should aim toreduce the present level by about  100 million and also to reduce by 50 million the present level of compensation to the electricity industry for price restraint (estimated at roughly  75 million a year) by taking full advantage of the provisions of the Stage 3 Code.    (Coal is not subject to the code).13.       If it is considered necessary to protect the poorest families(including supplementary pensioners) from the consequent increases in their fuel bills, an uprating would operate too slowly, and subjectto the views of the Secretary of State for Social Services I believe wecould only act effectively by giving a flat rate weekly addition for thetime being to each household receiving supplementary benefit or family income supplement.    At 25p per week, which should more than cover theirextra fuel bills, this would cost about  3 million a month.    legislation would be needed.
14.        At a time of acute energy shortage, it is in my view quite wrong tocontinue to sell coal and electricity significantly below their economicsost015,,       The effect of the public expenditure proposals is summarised inthe attached table,,    It is only by a broad approach of this kind, related to the main needs of the present situation, that we can secure the contribution we need from public expenditure,160        It will be very important to carry conviction that these cutsin the programmes are real.    It will be essential, therefore, to publish the agreed list of reductions for 1974-75, showing how they relate to thefigures for all. the programmes which now feature in the public expenditure White Paper.A treasury Chambers12 December 1973
