CP(73) 123 COPY NO      g ^21 November 1973CABINETOIL supplies memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. This paper considers the motor fuel stock position and the implications for the possible introduction of petrol rationing.STOCKS2. The Oil Industry Emergency Committee has reported that total stocks of motor spirit at 18 November amounted to 65 days supply, a drop of 5 days since end October.    If this rate of fall continued, the45 day stock level, when distribution difficulties would start to becomeacute, would be reached by end January.    The companies estimate thatmotor spirit supplies (much of which is imported) will fall short of demand from now on by about 25 per cent if not more.    This too would suggest that a critical stage would be reached by end January.    Dervpresents no immediate problem.3. The figure of 65 days includes gasoline content of crude held in stock.    Because of refinery breakdowns stocks of finished gasoline arenew down to minimum working levels.    This problem should be eased ascapacity comes back on stream, in a week or so.    One reason for maintaining adequate stocks is to guard against breakdowns such as this.DELIVERY CUTS4. The,assessment in paragraph 1 takes no account of savings thatmay be made as a result of the cuts in deliveries.    But we do not thinkthat these cuts, even at the level of 10 per cent, could be continued for more than about 3 weeks without introducing rationing or at least being ina position to introduce it soon thereafter.    If that were not possible, we might be forced in three weeks to step up deliveries to garages again to remedy shortages and to cure abuses that had developed.    The higher level of supplies would then need to be maintained until rationing couldstart - which, if the issue of books and coupons were not started untilmid-December, could not be before mid-January.    The Chairman of the oil Industry Emergency Committee, in the light of the present situation,
*3 tS   i\ is IThas urged that more severe restrictions be imposed on petrol deliveriesvery soon.    I do not consider that the introduction of a higher level ofcut, either now or later, would be practicable without rationing.TIMING5. If the issue of ration books at Post Offices started on Monday,26 November rationing could begin at any time after 17 December.Instructions for issuing would need to be given immediately so that thepublic could be informed of the arrangements but the actual decision to ration need not be taken until a few days before rationing was to start.6. If a decision on the issue of ration books were deferred until themiddle of next week, there would be virtually no prospect of introducingrationing before Christmas.    Moreover, the issuing period, a total of four weeks in all, would overlap the Christmas/New Year holiday period and would not be completed until the first week in January.    Before thattime we might have found it impossible to maintain the 10 per cent cut,let alone increase it.CONCLUSION AND recommendation. The future supply position for motor spirit gives cause for increasing concern.    I do not consider that the present cuts indeliveries can be sustained for more than a few weeks, much lessincreased, without causing abuse and discontent.    I, therefore, invitemy colleagues to agree that we put ourselves in a position to introducerationing quickly shculd this prove necessary by starting the issue ofration books as soon as possible.    In this way we can keep our optionsopen.P w department of Trade and Industry21 November 1973
