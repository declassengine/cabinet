THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.P(73) 124 ,   COPY NO     g &apos;J6 November 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT (ENGLAND AND WALES)Memorandum by the Chief Secretary,. treasury am sorry to add to the(documentation before my colleagues on this verydifficult subject but there are three points which I think we need to keep inminda0 There is a real dilemma here for the Government; too lowa grant, while exerting pressure on local authorities to cut spending,will produce unacceptable rate increases,,    Too generous a grant,while shielding ratepayers, will tempt many local authorities to spend more.    If therefore we are to seek to protect domesticratepayerSy we must be prepared to take stringent steps to inducelocal authorities to hold their spending to agreed totals,b0 The prospective public sector borrowing requirement for next year, though not so big as this year&apos;s figures is stillsubstantial;  any extra rate support grant will increase it.As the figures in the last column in paragraph 2 of the Secretaryof State fcr the Environments paper (CP(73) 123) shows the costof his options rises in steps of about  44 million^,c0 The Secretary of State for the Environment suggests inparagraph 10 of his paper that if the non-domestic rate increaseproduced by a lOp (basic) domestic element is too high, this couldbe mitigated by a higher rate of grant. I must make it clear thatif the Cabinet feels that the impact on the non-domestic ratepayeris not acceptable, then the agreed conclusions in the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland&apos;s paper (CP(73) 122) must be re-examined.PJTreasury Chambers6 November 1973
