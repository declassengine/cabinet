lo    Ministers have to decide -at    the total size of the Rate Support Grant for 1974-75;b.     on the way it is to be distributed among the local authorities.2o    Any decision about the total size of the Grant must be consistent with ministers overall public expenditure objectives.3*    So far as the distribution of the Rate Support Grant is concerned,3 main questions arise -a. how far should the new needs formula be allowed to redistribute infavour, very broadly, of the conurbationsj   and b. how far should transitional relief be provided for domestic rate payers in areas where the grant is reduced by the new formula.c. How far should the grant be distributed in relation to&quot;resources&quot;*4o     The Central Policy Review Staff recognises the difficulties to whichthe proposed form of redistribution gives rise.    But Ministers should bear in mind that it is part of their wider social objectives to encourage a selective approach to social affairs, in which resources are concentrated on those most in need.   And it is Government policy to try to do more forsome areas of urban deprivation.1CP(73) 121 COPY NO30 October 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT grant memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff
5.    The new needs formula has been devised as a more effective means of recognising social needs on the &quot;basis of selected social indicators.   Tothe extent that it is not allowed to take effect, or is counteracted byforms of transitional relief, there must be some risk of jeopardisingthese social objectives o6.     Increasing the &quot;resources&quot; element helps Wales and the rural areasof England, and reduces the amount going to London.   It also reduces whatis available for needs generally.   Where to strike the balance is apolitical decision.   But in taking that decision Ministers should bear inmind that the larger the resource element becomes, the more the grant for individual authorities becomes directly related to what they spend?this will almost certainly have the effect of increasing local authority expenditure in total.7.     In the longer term, the alternative to providing help for decliningurban areas through the Rate Support Grant would be to abandon the whole system of a block grant and return to specific grants.   But this would be quite inconsistent with the Governments reform of local government andits reorganisation of the health service?   it would require more detailedcentral Government supervision and would lead to increased expenditure.Tnis would be unacceptable in present circumstances.Cabinet Office30 October 19732
