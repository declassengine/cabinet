CP(73) 123 COPY no 6 November 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT (ENGLAND AND WALES) - TOTALOF grant memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environmentlo There are three main decisions we have to take in connection withthis year&apos;s rate support grant negotiationsia. The grant distribution formula - the Secretary of State for northern Ireland&apos;s paper CP(73) 122 reports on this0b. The forecast total of local authority expenditure - this issue is still before Cabinet bat I remain of the view that we cannot reasonably reduce the latest forecasts by more than  81 million,giving a total relevant expenditure of  5, 258 million (at November1972 prices),    The implications for Departments are set out in annexes 1 and 2; Annex 3 gives the calculation of relevant expenditure 0ce        The percentage rate of grant8 which I referred to in cp(73) 111 and now consider further in this paper.    In so doing,I am assuming agreement on the first two issues, but the methodof calculation would be broadly the same even if different views were taken.2* Our view on the appropriate rate of grant for next year must dependon the extent to which we are prepared to see rate burdens rise.    Thehigher the rate of grant8 the lower the average rate burden is likely tobe.    In summary form the choice of increase in domestic rate burdensand the corresponding percentage grant goes as follows;
Average increase in rate burden 1974-75 over1973-74 assuming avariable domestic elementwith a minimum ox lOpDomestic   Non-domesticGrant required as %of relevant    of expenditureexpenditure   including water and sewerage5%7%9%11%18 0 6%20u3%22.1%23, 7%60, 5%59c 8%59.1%58.3%57,8%570 1%56,4%55,7%Amount of grant required(at outturn1prices)  million39 7013, 65738 6123B 5687% represents the threshold figure for Stage 3; 9% is the likely increasein local authority costs (given the high manpower element) and 11% is the likely increase in earnings,3, The above figures ignore the new and much more generous raterebate scheme^ which will add something approaching  85 million toExchequer grants.    Although it applies to only about a quarter of domestic rate payers^ its effect on the domestic rate would be to reduce the average rate burden by about 7 per cent and therefore to cancel out the first twoaverago Incr-oases,,4. The above i3 an over-simple presentation.    It assumes a 9 per centinflation in local authority costs.    We learnt from bitter experience lastyear that while our calculations assumed that domestic rate burdens would go up by 3-f- per cent, in fact they went tip by 9 per cent0    This was due tomany factors,    But pre-emi&amp;ent amongst them was that local authoritiesdid not believe that we would contain inflation and rated more highlyaccordingly.    They were right,,    They might do the same again this year.So it would be wise to take the increases in domestic burdens suggested above as the minimum which could be achieved by grant settlements at thelevel shown.    The reality would probably be appreciably higher because wehave no way of stopping local authorities either from spending more or from]rating on the assumption of higher inflation than we are allowing for.    Andfurthermore if we impose larger reductions than local authorities will accept then because grant is so high a proportion the effect of the extra expenditure on rates is magnified,,    A 1 per cent error means a Zj per cent increase in rate burdens.    If authorities overspend by  50 million then theincrease in domestic rate burden would be 2 per cent higher in each case,5,        However the point we have to make is that provided local authoritieskeep to the expenditure policies implied by the figures above? and provided the counter-inflationary policy works, any overall increase in rates beyondthese figures is because local authorities have chosen to put their rateshigh.6,        If we make too generous a gj/ant, there will be a strong temptationfor many local authorities to spend more, knowing that they can do so without increasing the burden on the domestic ratepayer,,
TOTALS OF expenditure.        Normally we have a negotiation with the local authorities about theamount of expenditure to be accepted.    This year the discussions at official level have shown close agreement on the figuress except that the localauthorities are seeking an additional  14. 5 million for education and expressed strong opposition to accepting the  81 million cuts0    We haveno choice but to reject the claim for education and to impose at least thosecuts which are our announced policies^INCREASE ORDERS8. We have also to consider Increase Orders for 1972-73 and 1973-74.Officials have provisionally agreed figures for an Increase Order for 1972-71)with the local authorities..    A figure for 1973-74 will not be available untilimmediately before the statutory meeting on 27 November,,    But there is nodoubt of the need for such an Order0    I seek my colleagues agreement to making such an Order,, the figures for which I will agree with the chief secretary, Treasury.conclusions .        Against the above background we have to decide on the  o$al oflocal authority expenditure and the rate of grant010o       It seems to me that the main consideration must be to limit the rateof increase on domestic rates.    I would suggest that we should aim at a limit of 7 per cent.    On the assumption of total expenditure as in Anner. 1less reductions of  81 million, and the lOp domestic element recommended in the paper by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the total of grantrequired would be  3P 657 million (at outturn prices).    This is 59.8 per cent of relevant expenditure.    It is 57.1 per cent of total local expenditurecounting water and sewerage expenditure, as we have promised to do.But if my colleagues regard an increase of 20 per cent in rate burden on non-domestic ratepayers as too high, then this could be mitigated by increasing the precentage rate of grant.    Roughly speaking each 1 per cent increase in the rate of grant would mean a Zj per cent decrease in non-domestic rate burdens (and a decrease in domestic rate burdens too), atan extra Exchequer cost of  60 million.11.        I regard a 59.8 per cent rate of grant on relevant expenditure(57.1 per cent on total expenditure) as justifiable.    But if we make a biggerreduction than  81 million in the accepted total of expenditure while weshould have to base grant on the lower figure I must warn my colleagues that it would be difficult to justify a lower percentage of grant than I am nowsuggesting.12.       I therefore seek my colleagues^ agreement to:a. A settlement with local authorities on the lines outlined above.b. Agreement to negotiate Increase Orders with the approval ofthe Chief Secretary, Treasury.G r department of the Environment6 November 1973

Thocub-group identified potential savings of between  .12 and  13&apos;.&apos;p million butaccepted that the extent to which these would be achieved in practice would depend upon the response of each local authority to Government urging that therate of growth of expenditure on these services should be reduced.,   To achieve these savings would involve refraining from recruiting staff to make goodwastage or to fill additional posts&quot;, depressing standards of maintenance and repair, and increasing charges whore possible.   This could mean less frequentcollections of refuse, reducing the hours of opening of recreational facilities,increased delays in dealing with planning and environmental health matters, andsome longer-term diseconomies..To secure yet further savings above the level would require action by localauthorities to create staff redundancies and for decisions to defer putting new capital assets into commission (for example vehicles or swimming baths), or to restrict their use below the level which would otherwise be adopted.D03 ROADS - - ,Tho Sub-Group produced agreed forecasts amounting to  ^7-l*9m (relevant expendi-ture, November 1972 prices).

(confidential)-V.___________.....^  ____________  . sANNEX 2D3S1.   The forecasts prepared by the Education Sub-Group make full allowance for the expenditure consequences of expected growth in public and studentnunbers and provide for the continuation of the annual improvement factor of3;&apos;j allowed for 1973-7^ in non-teaching costs in schools and further educationarid (for the first time) in teacher training.2.   The local autb.oriti.es argue that in the light of the outturn of   expenditure for 1972-73 the 3fj improvement factor is inadequate for schools and further education and should bo raised to 5*$.   This would increase the forecasts by about 1% in 19?4-75 (rising to some  &quot;50m in 1976-77).3,   The Department accepts the Sub-Group forecasts as a realistic assessment of the cost of a continuation of existing policies, but maintains that a reductionof  22u (the Department&apos;s share of the total of S8lm) is feasible.   The localauthorities have reluctantly accepted the Department1s suggestion that it should beleft to individual authorities to decide the most appropriate means of achievingsavings in the light of local circumstances.   In practice the Department expectsthat, if authorities are willing to co-operate in this exercise, their response will include cutting back expenditure on the maintenance of buildings, the provision ofboohs and equipment and on some of the less central areas of the educational service.-Reductions of this kind will undoubtedly arouse criticism, which would be all thecore severe, if as is possible, some of the better placed authorities seek to achievesavings by limiting increases in teacher numbers.h.   The Department is convinced that there is no scope for setting out to achieve a reduction more than marginally greater than  22m in 197^-75 by the method already suggested.   The local authorities have themselves argued very strongly in the same sense;.    If a larger reduction had to be sought the Department could not avoid takingresponsibility for issuing specific guidance as to the areas and types ofexpenditure where savings should be made, and for acknowledging the policyimplications of this advice.,    In the Department&apos;s view it y:culd not bo possible to frame this advice in terms which did not cast doubt on the Government&apos;s intention to implement the policies announced in the education V/hite Paper of last December, or which were not inconsistent with recent circulars and other pronouncements on. other areas of policy, eg the library service.    Ill any event, given the internal, impetuswithin the local authority education expenditure, and particularly its high, staffing
(confidential)&apos;content., the scope for rapid reduction in planned levels of expenditure is limited.   In consequence, the action proposed to achieve this larger level of savings, night fail of its main purpose, ana succeed only in -exposing the Governmentto the charge -that they v/ere abandoning their declared policies for education.Department of Education &amp; ScienceNovember 1973^confidential

PiHSOIIaL SOCIAL services the total of local authority estimates for 1974/75 is  391.3 million(including  3-3 million transfer for the net effect of professional stafftransfers to and from health authorities) which implies a rate of growth ofabout Hp over the estimated outturn for 1973/74*   For personal social servicesalone i,s. excluding port health, concessionary fares, and the professionalctaff transfers, the rate of growth is about 10;?.   The reduction of these estimates by  4*5 million would reduce the latter rate of growth to about 9$in comparison with 15$ during 1972/73, the last year for which outturn figures are available.   The Secretary of State for Social Services had agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer a further reduction of 5:8 million, in view of theneed to reduce total expenditure on the Health and Personal Social Servicesprogrammes.   This will reduce the rate of growth of these services to about 6-gffj,The continuing results in 1974/75 of decisions taken earlier (the revenueconsequenco of capital schemes, and the full year effect of developments includingstaff recruitment which incurred only a part year cost in 1973/74) are expectedto require a growth in expenditure of about 5$.   The proposed reduction will therefore imply only the most modest other growth of service in 1974/75? l&apos;HSS thinkit would be impractical to envisage any further reductions.   &apos; -
