v1MEMBERS1 PAY AND ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. I have recently been increasingly pressed by individual members and by groups of Members (for example, Mr Houghton on behalf of theParliamentary Labour Party) for increases to be made in the currentlevels of Members&apos; pay and allowances,, last fixed following the reportof the Review Body on Top Salaries, under Lord Boyle&apos;s chairmanship,published in September, 1971.    I understand that the Lord Privy Sealhas been under similar, if not heavier, pressure to increase the presentPeers&apos; daily expenses allowance.    The basic Members&apos; salary of 4, 500 was in September 1973 estimated to have lost  560 in terms ofits original purchasing power since its introduction in January 1972.2. So far it has been possible to avoid direct replies by saying, as I did in winding up the debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech on 6 November, thatthe Government is considering these matters, but I believe the stagehas now been reached when we must make clear to both Houses whetheror not we interd to do anything on this question during this Parliament.3. The general background, so far as the House of Commons isconcerned, is that we have made clear our intention that their shouldbe only one Review Body enquiry during any Parliament of normal length,but neither we nor the Boyle Report have ruled out entirely thepossibility of interim adjustments between reviews.    The BoyJeCommittee&apos;s review did not cover the House of Lords, but there is a ministerial understanding that the Peers&apos; allowance &quot;should be kept underreview in the light of rises in relevant Civil Service rates of subsistence&quot;.These rates have increased twice since the Review Body8s report, andtheir present levels would justify a substantial increase in the Pewrs&apos;allowance from  8. 50 to  10. 50 a day4. I believe it is generally accepted in the House of Commons that no increase in the basic salary of Members can be made in advance of afurther report by the Review Body.    Pressure for an increase in some,if not all, allowances is, however, more substantial.CF(73) 130 COPY NO     (J f26 November 1973CABINET
5. The present Commons5 allowances, in addition to the basicMembers&apos; salary of  4, 500 are briefly as follows:-(i)   Secretarial allowance      Maximum of  1, 000 towards Members&apos;secretarial expenses incurred fortheir Parliamentary duties.    this includes a maximum of  300 on research assistance.(ii)   London Supplement 175 per annum payable to Membersof * london constituencies.(iii)   Subsistence allowance(iv)   Travelling expenses and car allowanceMaximum of  750 per annum in respectof expenses incurred by &apos;non-London&apos;Members in living away from home incarrying out their essentialParliamentary duties.6. The position with regard to Peers is different.    Peers have nosalary.    The House of Lords&apos; expense allowance is the only payment to members of that House; it is related to actual expenses incurred;  andPeers cannot offset for tax purposes against a salary expenses incurredabove the  8. 50 limit.    Nevertheless, it seems to me ine-it able that anyrise granted to the Peers in isolation would be unacceptable to many members in the Commons.7. I would personally like to see an increase in the Commons&apos;secretarial allowance.    The cost of secretarial help has increased moresharply than most other increases in Members&apos; expenses;  it has anundeniable effect on Members&apos; working efficiency; and it could be reasonably presented as an increase for secretaries rather than for members.    It has been suggested by some Members that it would assistpresentationally if payments to Members&apos; secretaries could in some waybe made directly by the Fees Office.    I think the consideration of anychange of this kind must await a further reference to the Review Body.But I do not consider this need rule out some increase in the Members1secretarial allowance under the existing arrangements, provided such anincrease is clearly within the limits of the Governments prices and incomes policy.    I am thinking in terms of an increase of  200 from thepresent maximum of  1, 000.8. I do not consider we should increase the Members1 subsistence allowance and I believe a tenable distinction can be maintained betweenthe Peers&apos; expenses allowance, which is the only payment they receive,and the commons, subsistence allowance, which was only introducedfollowing the Boyle Report in the course of this Parliament-.2
9. The Government is not, I under stand, legally required to referany increases in this field to the Pay Board.    Nevertheless, it would bein accordance with our general undertaking to conform with the Code forCrown employees and seem presentationally important that any increases in the allowances of either House should be shown to be consistent withPhase 3.    I would, therefore, suggest that if any increases are proposed,they should be referred to the Pay Board for their agreement that theyconform with Jhe Pay Code rules.10.       As I see it, the choice of action seems to be either to make no increase at all in this Parliament in either House, or to increase thePeers1 expense allowance by  2 a day, and the Members8 secretarialallowance by  200 per annum, provided this is compatible with the pay and prices policy.    On balance, I would propose the second of these alternatives.11,       The Lord Privy Seal supports this paper as regards the proposedlevel of increase in the Peers&apos; expense allowance.J privy Council Office26 November 19733
