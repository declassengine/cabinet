CP(73) 137 COPY NO       ,5 m0 320 December 1973CABINETGOVERNMENT POLICY: PRESENTATIONMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The overall objective of the Governments information machine isto achieve the maximum understanding and approval of government policies. Ij2. The means by which this objective might be achieved are manifold.They range from simple hour-to-hour contacts between the government information Service and journalists to major speeches by Ministers, and include free and paid for publicity techniques.    The information office ofeach Government Department, with the aid of the COI and HMSO, exploitsthe opportunities as best it can.3. The machine is not uniformly efficient.    Its relative efficiencyreflects a number of factors.    In some caees it may be because of defectson the part of the Government Information Service; in others it may bebecause of an insufficiently positive approach of the Department, and even of its Ministers, to information and its Information Service.    The lattermay, as a consequence, be saddled with a near-impossible job.4. Given these factors, and the nature of information work, the needfor effective co-ordination is clear.    The main purpose of this paper isto suggest ways in which it might be improved at Governmental level.5. Currently, co-ordination at that level is attempted through a variety of channels.    These are:-i.     The Minister with special responsibility for theGovernment Information Services, now the Lord Privy Seal,to whom the Parliamentary Secretary, Civil Service department is responsible.ii.     The Lord President of the Council has a general responsibility for presenting Government policies in the commons and has regular contact with the Lobby.    Atpresent the Lord President is also Deputy Chairman of theConservative Party, and consequently has an additional,although distinguishable, interest in the presentation of policy.
iii.     The Prime Ministers press Office.   It is inevitable that the No  10 office will have a major co-ordinating role.This variety of channels arises to some extent from the different outlets:the public and mediaj Parliament; the Party Organisation.6. In such a situation there is a risk of too many cooks working in too many kitchens - generally with too little time to devote to the dish.    this can lead to too much emphasis on tactics and too little on strategy.7. In prescribing a solution the objective should be to reduce thenumber of cooks and kitchens and to concentrate the cooking in one place.The following seems to present the best possible framework:a. General strategy for Government presentation should be worked out by the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with hisMinisterial colleagues, working closely with the Prime Ministersoffice.b. The Lord President of the Council should be responsiblefor communicating that strategy to Parliament (and the Party),working through his own office and serviced directly by No. 10.c. The No 10 Press Office, reporting in this field to the lord privy Seal, should be responsible at official level for co-ordinating the Government&apos;s overall approach to the information media andshould be responsible for the co-ordination of presentation overparticular areas of policy.d. Individual Ministers should of course continue to be directly responsible for the presentation of their particular policies.In short, the presentation of Government policy should be brought togetherat Ministerial level under the Lord Privy Seal, supported by theParliamentary Secretary, Civil Service Department, working throughNo 10 at official level.E H1 0 Downing Street20 December 1973
