SI il II is 1CABINETFUEL AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIESNote by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry- /I1. The annexes to this paper assess the outlook for oil (Annex A) and coal and electricity supplies (Annex B) following the visit of the Saudi Arabianand Algerian Ministers and the decision of the National Union of Mineworkers,after their meeting with the Prime Minister, to defer a ballot of their members on the Stage 3 pay offer and maintain the overtime ban,2. These annexes are relevant to consideration of CP(73) 133 and cp(73) 135 and I invite my colleagues to note their conclusions.P w department of Trade and industry December 1973CP(73) 136 COPY NO        0 33 December 1973
ANNEX AOIL1      The latest forecasts (30 November) from the Oil IndustryEmergency Committee (OIEO) show a shortfall in crude landingsof 16% for December and just over 20% for January.       In addition the net export surplus in products is estimated to be an averageof 5% lor each month.2      If we received our normal supplies from non-Arab sources,our shortfall (including products; would be about 14% in december and 20% in January-3      To secure all the oil that we require it would be necessary:(a) to ensure that all Arab producers deliver what Tamanihas already promised for Saudi Arabia.(b) to press the Arabs to give us a larger share of theirreducing production at the expense of the &quot;neutral countries&quot; (eg Japan, Germany etc.).     This additionwould have to include crude sufficient to meet economicand seasonal growth and to make up our loss of products from Rotterdam.(c) to ensure that the oil companies did not reallocatesupplies from non-Arab countries to &quot;share the misery&quot;.If we are prepared to meet the consequences, we may beable to control BP (17% of the UK market); we may alsobe able to influence Shell (26% of the UK market butDutch owned) but we have little control over the others.4      Stocks on 26 November were 63 days averaged over all products.On the latest companies&apos; forecasts of 30 November for imports and exports and on the basis of present restrictions, they will rundown to 56 days by end-December, and 52 days by end-January.The companies say that the product most at risk (assuming CEGB oilburn is increased as proposed in CP (73)  ^3 ) will be fuel oil,which would be down to 45 days.by mid-January and could reach the critical 30 days in March.   Most other products are forecast toremain above the 40-day level over that period, though there willbe anxieties over motor spirit/naptha, and a continuance orworsening of distribution difficulties.5      We applied control of exports to non-e.c. countries in November,imposing a 20% cut subject to exceptions if the companies couldjustify them e.g. by new refinery capacity.     Companies&apos; forecasts of product exports in this next two months are less than in recent months, but there is a bigger fall in imports (mainly from Rotterdam)Thus companies forecast a net export surplus of 0.63 million tons of products in December,  and 0.28 million tons in January, compared Withour traditional import surplus.       Fuel oil accounts for 0.16 million/tons .
tons net (0.33 million tons gross) and 0.05 million tons net (0.26million tons gross) of this respectively.     Our first two weeksreturns show that most of oar fuel oil exports are going to e.c., and.within the e.c. largely to th  Irish Republic.6       To impose a formal export licensing restriction against EECcould cause great trouble in Brussels (though we could plead our coalcrisis).     Nevertheless we must clearly do all we can to limit our exports, particularly of fuel oil, and should aim to achieve thisby pressure on the companies, with the threat of more formal andrigorous controls on exports, including e.c. destinations, if they donot comply.   We shall need to do this carefully if we are not to prejudice our product imports or encourage diversion of crude.I am discussing with the companies whether these prospects justifyimmediate further restrictions on oil use generally.     Eor fuel oil,there is an immediate threat.We must therefore consider whether:(a) to pursue the policy in paragraph 3(b) to make further cuts in fuel oil consumption(except for electricity generation, considered separately in CP(73)133)(c) to secure a more rigorous control over exports, includingexports to e.c..
ANNEX BCoalOur coal production losses over the past three weeks from the miners&apos;oven line ban were 24 per cent, 28 per cent and 30 per cent, andthe average supply loss from its continuation into January (taking account of the Christmas break) is likely to be 35-4-0 per cent.Though stocks of industrial and domestic coal are good, they would run out in March if the overtime ban continued, and in February ifthere were a strike.    Some local difficulties would emerge sooner.A continuing 35-4-0 per cent loss of coal alone would cause somehardship for individuals and some loss of industrial output, although this would be severe for steel and cement - both losing 25-30 per cent of production.    But its effect on electricity supply would be veryserious, and the situation would be compounded by the cutback inour oil suppliesoElectricityCP(73)133 shows that, if the miners overtime ban continues and theCEGB get only 13 per cent less oil than last year, the electricitysystem will be in a critical state by end-January/early-February.At that point, widespread disconnection of load would be inescapable,leading quite soon to a maj.or disruption of supplies, seriouslyaffecting industrial production.    Commercial and domestic consumerswould also be badly hit.   Within 2-3 weeks, say by early March,generating capacity would be down to the level reached in the miners&apos;strike in February 1972.    Some essential services were then indifficulty and some factories on the point of closing.    The problemsof running the reduced electricity system would be increased if theEPEA&apos;s ban were still in force.This level of capacity would barely suffice to meet the reducedsummer demand and, even if full coal supplies were restored inthe Spring, it would be impracticable to build up power stationstocks to an adequate level in time for the winter 1974/1975, thusputting electricity supplies at risk then.If the miners call a full strike - and the probability is that theywill either return to normal working or call a full strike in theNew Jeecc - the position would be much more serious.    Electricityavailability would be reduced to one-third of normal capacity within4 weeks; and there would be sufficient only for essential servicesand domestic lighting, and very little for non-essential industry,shops and offices, or for domestic space and water heating.To enable the electricity industry to scrape through the winterwithout major disruption would require additional reductions in demand from now on of as much as 20 per cent (miners&apos; overtime bancontinuing) or 35 per cent (full strike).    In the last miners&apos;strike we achieved - with the consequences described above - abouta 20 per cent reduction mainly by a rota of planned and highlyselective disconnections coupled with limitation of the number ofdays industry was allowed to use electricity.   With the EPEA ban,a system of disconnections now would have to be much cruder (SOLDER)and would not discriminate, save to a very limited extent, betweensupplies to essential and non-essential users.
Voluntary savings in response to a substained campaign forfuel economy, eg to restrict electricity use for space beatingto one room where no other heating was available, might save10 per cent at best.   To reach a 20 per -cent saving, the SOLDERsystem of disconnections could be introduced or industry limitedto a 3-day week, except for large essential and continuousprocess users whose demands would be reduced by about one-third.To reach 33%   &quot;the intensity of the planned disconnections couldbe stepped up or industry in general limited to a 2-day weekand continuous process users to 30 per cent of their normalsupplies.Strict economy would of course also be necessary in the use ofother fuels including oil.CONCLUSION I]A public campaign to conserve fuel, and especially electricityshould I believe be launched immediately.   However, beforeimposing severe restrictions on industry which would ^seriouslydamage economic growth, my colleagues.es will wish to considerthe prospects of improving our oil situation, and whether thereare any new initiatives we can take to end industrial action bythe miners.    (To escape the danger of electricity cuts this winter we should need-.assuming only a 13 per cent oil cut forCEGB -to have full coal production restored at latest by mid-January.)Failing this, a decision to impose restrictions of the type and scale I have indicated will need to be taken very soon.
