FOREWORDAs announced during the debate on last year&apos;s public expenditure white paper, the form of the Supply Estimates is being altered to show more clearlywhat the functions or objectives of the expenditures are, as in the White Papersthemselves. With some simplification of the functional classification in theWhite Paper so that it will now provide for 15 main programmes (in place of21) with sub-divisions into programmes and sub-programmes, the white paper and the Supply Estimates for 1974-75 will for the first time use thesame classification. The proposals for achieving this were submitted to andwelcomed by both the Public Accounts Committee and the Select Committeeon Expenditure.
PART public Expenditure   General review. This White Paper is presented at a time of much uncertainty for world economic prospects, both in the near future and further ahead. In particular the future prospects for the supply and price of oil to the western world cannot yet be adequately assessed; and the consequences for the UK economy, andthus the context in which public expenditure has to be planned and controlled,will need to be kept under close review. In these circumstances the fact thatthe public expenditure programmes must necessarily be provisional in some respects acquires added importance.2. Last year&apos;s White Paper showed public expenditure growing rapidly in 1972-73 and 1973-74, while there were conditions of high unemployment,but much more slowly from 1974-75 onward. This pattern is preserved. Theneed from now on is to move a higher proportion of total resources intoexports and industrial investment, which must mean a lower growth for public expenditure for some time to come. The policies underlying the individual programmes have regard to this requirement.3. Table 1.1 overleaf gives the figures for all the main programmes in1973-74 and 1977-78 and shows that expenditure is expected to grow at anaverage annual rate (*), in cost terms and at constant prices, of 2-0 per cent.This compares with 2-5 per cent for the comparable period (1972-73 to 1976-77)in last year&apos;s White Paper.4. Programme figures for all years from 1968-69 onward are summarised in Tables 2A and 2B in Part 2. The rates of increase, in each case on thepreceding year, are:1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-781-8 1-6 1-6 2-85. The totals of expenditure year by year are a major element in thefinancial balance of the public sector; and from this point of view all expendi-tures, whatever their resource content or their impact on demand, have thesame effect. Increases in some expenditures bring partially offsetting increases in receipts, eg social security payments, under the normal contributionsarrangements.(!) Excluding investment grants.

6. When considering the economic impact of expenditure, however, it isnecessary to adjust the figures to allow for the varying demand on real resourcesmade by different kinds of expenditure^). In these terms, the average annual increase for the period 1973-74 to 1977-78 is put at 2-5 per cent(3). The corres-ponding figure for 1972-73 to 1976-77 was 3-4 per cent(4).7. The absolute levels of expenditure in the years 1974-75 to 1976-77,the years common to both White Papers, are now forecast to be marginallylower in real terms than the levels forecast twelve months ago.8. The slowing down of the growth of total expenditure will be accompaniedby appreciable changes in the balance between individual programmes. Thefollowing table shows the comparative rates of growth in cost terms for theperiod 1972-73 to 1976-77 (the then current year and the four following years)in last year&apos;s White Paper and for the corresponding period 1973-74 to 1977-78in this White Paper, programme by programme.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF GROWTH INPERCENTAGE TERMSTABLE 1.2	1972 White Paper:	This White Paper:	1972-73 to 1976-77(5)	1973-74 to 1977-781.

9. The changes since the last White Paper in the absolute totals for the par-ticular programmes are set out in detail in Tables 3.11 and 3.12 on page [ ], anda summary of the changes is given in paragraph 10 below. Of those affectingsingle programmes the more important are upward changes in the estimates for housing subsidies (partly reflecting higher interest rates) and lending;increased expenditure on social security benefits following the 1973 uprating;the consequences for this year and next of counter-inflation policy on the nationalised industries, any sums needed for later years being met, if necessary,from the general contingency reserve; further support to the British railways board; and the switch from roads to other transport expenditure.10. The net effect of these few major items alone is to add substantially to expenditure in each year of the period covered. In 1974-75, for example,they imply an additional cost of over  600 million. Nevertheless, other policyand estimating changes enable these increases to be absorbed within totalswhich are lower than those forecast last year. For 1974-75 the most important factor in producing this result was the announcement made in May of reductionsaffecting a wide range of programmes and totalling  528 million(10) in that year,which it was indicated at the time would be reflected, with estimating and other changes, in this White Paper. There was one other policy change of a general character: in October, the letting of a wide range of public sector buildingcontracts was phased forward from 1973 into 1974, primarily to relieve over-loading of the building industry, but also leading to expenditure savings ofabout  100 million in 1973-74.(!0) This figure is of course at 1973 Survey prices; the figure in the announcement wasgiven in 1972 Survey prices.
11.  The following table shows in summary form the main changes.CHANGES SINCE CMND. 5178TABLE 1.3   million at 1973 Survey prices	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77A: Policy Changes				1.

The allocation of resources, including provision for industrial invest-ment and for the external balance, is illustrated in broad terms in Table 1.4 The use of resources 1972-1978.13. The assumptions underlying a medium-term projection of this kindare subject to considerable uncertainty, and it is therefore not possible to drawhard and fast conclusions from the figures.14. Line A shows the overall increase in resources on the basis of two alternative rates of growth of GDP 3  per cent a year and 4  per cent a year.The remainder of the table sets out the allocation of the extra resources. Thereare two investment variants for each growth case, as any estimates of investmentrequirements are inevitably very uncertain. The public expenditure projectionsare derived from the programmes set out in this White Paper and are thus con-sistent with them; the average rate of growth 2-9 per cent a year is composedof a 4-8 per cent rate of growth between 1972 and 1973 and a rather loweraverage increase, 2-6 per cent a year, for the future (1973-1978). The residualshows the resources which, on the assumptions underlying the remaining items,would be available for increased privately-financed consumption. The growthrates for privately-financed consumption are less than the corresponding ratesof growth of GDP a direct consequence of the resources assumed to be re-quired for investment and the achievement of external balance.(ii) The savings are shown for the years to which the announcement was primarilydirected. The consequences in later years have been subsumed in lines 2(6) and 8.
15. This assessment in resource terms looks at average movements on certain assumptions over the medium term period as a whole. But as the de-cisions announced since the last White Paper have demonstrated, expendituremay have to be adjusted in the shorter term to contribute to demand manage-ment, quite apart from the estimating changes whichexperience has shown to be inevitable even within the space of a year. The importance of the impact on the economy, and thus on public expenditure planning, of the uncertainties deriving from the oil situation have already been stressed.   ! &apos;&apos;J j

PART public Expenditure The Individual ProgrammesINTRODUCTION1. The Expenditure Committee have suggested that an information system&apos;based on outputs as well as inputs, covering all items of public expenditure should be established; and that a start should be made this year by publishingin the public expenditure White Paper, in tabular form, any available informationshowing what expenditures are intended to purchase and the results they areexpected to achieve. (Eighth Report, Session 1971-72, HC 515.) In response tothese recommendations, the following chapters on individual programmesinclude more information than hitherto of a non-financial kind.2. These chapters embody the results of further work which has been undertaken to identify the main determinants of expenditure, the policy con-siderations bearing on the level of expenditure proposed, and the outputs of programmes. To show a satisfactory relationship of expenditure to output, to evaluate plans and to monitor performance may not always be possible in a statistical layout. In some cases it has been possible to construct useful tables;in others it has seemed better to include the information in the main text. Brevityis essential if the White Paper is not to become unmanageably large; and insome cases where relevant information appears in other publications, cross-references have been given.3. The non-financial information provided in this paper is far from com-prehensive and is not always available for the same run of years as for financialdata. The Government intends to extend and improve it as work proceeds in deparments on the relationships between expenditure and its determinants, andon developing better measures of output. There are, however, some areas ofexpenditure which are not susceptible to this type of analysis, as is the case whenthe expenditure is only one of many factors influencing the outcome.4. Tables 2A and 2B below, which analyse expenditure by main programme for each year from 1968-69 to 1977-78, provide the figures on two price bases.The figures in Table 2A, like those in Table 00 in Part 1, are all in cost terms.The programme figures in Table 2B, like those in the succeeding individualprogramme sections in Part 2, are in volume terms. (A note on these two pricebases is provided in Section II of Part 4 pages 00 below.)

The Defence Budget covers all expenditure by the Ministry of defence as well as expenditure by the Property Services Agency on works for defence purposes. The broad objectives underlying this expenditure, Britain&apos;s strategicpriorities, and the main decisions taken in fulfilment of these objectives and priorities remain as set out in Cmnd 5178.2. Further information on the Defence Budget total for 1973-74 was givenin the 1973 Statement on Defence (Cmnd 5231). This information included an account of current plans for the forces, and of the differences, which in real terms were small, between the 1973-74 Defence Estimates and the corresponding total iin Cmnd 5178. Since the 1973 Statement on Defence, decisions have been taken 1]affecting the level of defence expenditure in the short term. These decisions were included in statements by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime minister on 21 May and 8 October 1973 respectively. The Defence Budget totals in the table above reflect these decisions, details of which, together with the other policy and estimating changes that have occurred since Cmnd 5178, are set out below. Further details of the 1974-75 figure in the table above will be given inthe 1974 Statement on Defence.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE3.   The policy changes since Cmnd 5178, and their effects, are: (a) The inclusion in the Defence Budget of provisional estimates of thecost of relocating certain defence facilities now at Shoeburyness topermit progress on the Third London Airport. The sums involved are  11 million in 1974-75,  16 million in 1975-76 and  17 million in 1976-77.(b) Reductions of  2-8 million in 1974-75 and in 1975-76, and of 2-3 million in 1976-77 following the premature repayment in1972-73 of certain United States military aircraft loans.(c) Increases of  4 million in 1974-75 and  6 million in 1975-76arising out of the acceleration of payments to shipbuilders for naval construction work.(d) Reductions of  10 million and  60 million in 1973-74 and 1974-75respectively, as part of the measures announced by the Chancellor

These reductions include thedefence element of savings in Civil Service manpower,(e) Reductions in defence purchases of  15 million, and in defenceworks of  4 million in 1973-74, as part of the measures announced by the Prime Minister on 8 October 1973. There will be a conse-quential reduction in defence works expenditure in 1974-75currently estimated at  12 million. This also is reflected in the table above. -4.   The estimating adjustments reflect mainly :-(a) For 1974-75  32 million for the extra costs of Service manpower and  26 million for extra costs arising out of peacekeeping opera-tions in Northern Ireland (if required, adjustments on account ofthese items will be made to the Defence Budget figures for later years when the amounts involved can be more accurately quantified).(b) An increase in 1974-75 of  80 million consequent upon the abolitionof the Purchasing (Repayment) Services Votes. The effect of this change in the accounting arrangements, which involves no changein the defence programme itself, was set out in Cmnd 5178; as stated there, adjustments for 1975-76 and 1976-77 will be made infuture public expenditure White Papers.(c) The latest assessment of the cost of the planned defence programme which, taken together with the short term savings described in sub-paragraphs 3 (d) and (e) above, produce a reduction of  37 million in 1975-76.(d) A reduction of  5 million in the provisional figure for 1976-77published in Cmnd 5178. The 1976-77 figure in the table above isnow firm.5.  The figure for 1977-78 is provisional only at this stage.6. The policy reduction of  17 million in 1972-73 under national accountsadjustments is due to earlier repayment in respect of United States military aircraft-.

The main items of expenditure are certain overseas service pensions and various international commitments and subscriptions. These include payments under a Treasury guarantee to the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (because of default on the part of the Government of SouthernRhodesia)*, the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to regular budgets ofUnited Nations organisations and of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe and the North atlantic treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs), and a grant in aid to the CommonwealthWar Graves Commission.Military aid. This heading covers military training assistance, which provides forcourses in the United Kingdom for the Service personnel of other countries, andthe provision of British Service personnel on loan to developing (mainly Com-commonwealth) countries. It also covers the cost of equipment and capital aidsupplied to a few countries, including a grant of  2 million to the KenyanGovernment towards the cost of arms and equipment to be supplied fromBritish sources.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE. 7. While the grant to Kenya constitutes the main policy change, the onlysignificant estimating change from Cmnd 5178 revalued has been a reductionfor 1973-74 of  3-1 million in the provision for special defence aid forMalaysia, following the Malaysian Governments wish that it should be replaced by economic assistance (provision for which is made within the Overseas&quot;Air programme).Overseas aid.8. The figures for overseas aid shown in Table 2.2 are net of amortisationand at constant (1973 Survey) prices. Overseas aid on a net basis counts towardsthe internationally accepted target of at least 1 per cent of GNP for total* Session 1972-73, HC. 252.
financial flows to developing countries in each calendar year. The UnitedKingdom Government has undertaken to do its best to reach this target by1975. Total net official flows in 1972 were 0-41 per cent of GNP and with theestimated addition of private flows a figure of 0-96 per cent was reached. Takingthe four years 1969 to 1972 together the average performance for the UnitedKingdom has been just above the target. It is expected that private flows willcontinue to make a substantial contribution to our performance.9. The most important single change has been brought about by theUnited Kingdom joining the European Economic Community. This will lead tosome reorientation of our aid through Community organisations such as theEuropean Development Fund. Distribution of the aid programme is influenced by a wide and complex range of developmental, political and economic con-siderations. An important factor which the Government takes account of is long-standing relationships such as those with the Commonwealth. These factorsaffect the allocation of resources between geographical areas, the modes of aidsuch as bilateral or multilateral capital aid and technical assistance, and within such allocations the nature of individual projects. Capital aid and technical assistance to individual countries are considered together to create balancedprogrammes.10. The allocation of the aid programme is reviewed annually. In 1974-75,54-5 per cent of the gross planning total is expected to go to bilateral capital aid,16-5 per cent to multilateral aid and about 20 per cent to technical assistance.Over 5 per cent goes through the Commonwealth Development Corporation and about 4 per cent is used to relieve overseas Governments of pension liabilitiesin respect of British expatriates.11. Of British multilateral aid, the majority goes to the international development Association. Contributions to the European Development fund will not figure significantly before 1975-76. The United Nations development programme and other UN aid and relief agencies, as well as some regional development Banks, are supported by British contributions. An efficientmultilateral institution can draw individual donors together in a mutual effort which could result in increased total aid flows to developing countries. This is animportant consideration in influencing the British Governments support ofa rising multilateral programme, though efficiency in managing the aid is also an essential requirement.12. Nearly two-thirds of bilateral capital aid in 1972 was in the form of loans (mainly interest free) and over one-third in the form of grants. Thedifferent uses of such aid are best considered over a period of years. During thefive years 1968-1972,  504 million represented commitments of project aid and 377 million was non-project aid. Of the project aid, 37 per cent was for economicinfra-structure, 7 per cent for natural resources including agriculture, and 28per cent for investment in Social Services.13. Technical assistance helps developing countries overcome their short-ages of skilled manpower. It includes the provision of people to do jobs for whichthere are insufficient trained personnel locally, and support for the education andtraining of local people. British bilateral technical assistance in 1972 included
the support of over 13,500 advisers, experts and teachers and nearly 2,800volunteers in developing countries; and the training in the United Kingdom ofover 9,200 students and nearly 4,600 trainees. Detailed statistical information for the past 5 years is available in HMSO&apos;s publication &quot;British Aid Statistics&quot;,and an account of the British Aid Programme as provided to the DevelopmentAssistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment is published in Cmnd 5445.14- While it is not possible to give any precise evaluation, and whileeconomic growth is more rapid in some developing countries than in others,there can be no doubt of the contribution which aid makes to the developmentof the countries which receive it, both in supplementing resources of foreign exchange and making possible the execution of projects for which localresources are not available. Employment opportunities continue to figure as animportant consideration in the use of British aid. Assistance over populationproblems is available for those developing countries which wish to avail them-selves of this help.Overseas aid administration15. This covers the administration expenses of the FCO/overseas development Administration previously included in Overseas Representation.In addition to the headquarters in London the ODA maintain five DevelopmentDivisions overseas, in the Caribbean (Bridgetown), Middle East (Beirut), SouthEast Asia (Bangkok), East Africa (Nairobi) and Southern Africa (Blantyre).The cost covers staff, accommodation and official travel both at home and overseas.Contributions to the European Communities, etc. (net)16. The figures in this line in Table 2.2 above show estimates of the netpayments to be made by the United Kingdom as a result of membership of theEuropean Communities. They comprise two main elements: first, the UnitedKingdom&apos;s payments to the budget of the European Communities; second,certain once-for-all contributions to the European Investment Bank and to theEuropean Coal and Steel Community.17; Our estimated payments to the Community budget are based on theterms of accession approved by Parliament under which the United Kingdom iscontributing 8-78 per cent of Community expenditure in 1973, and will con-tribute 11-04 per cent in 1974. This percentage will rise in steps to 19-24 per centin 1977. Under the provisions of Article 131a of the Treaty of Accession theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution in 1978 will depend in part on the amount of&quot;own resources&quot; collected in the United Kingdom in 1977. As it is impossible at present to make a valid estimate of what this will be the figures for 1978assume that the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the Community budget in 1978 willbe the same percentage as in 1977. In practice that share can be expected to be somewhat higher.18. For 1973 the figures are based on the 1973 Community budget, includingsupplementary budgets, and for 1974 on the draft budget as forwarded by theCouncil to the European Parliament. In arriving at the projections for theremaining period, account has been taken of forecasts for 1975 and 1976 made
by the Commission. No figures are included at this stage for either expenditureor receipts in connection with the Regional Development Fund, due to comeinto operation in 1974, since negotiations on the setting up of the Fund are stillin progress.19. In the figures shown above, payments to the budget are shown net ofUnited Kingdom receipts from the budget. The tables below set out the estimatedgross contributions to and receipts from the Community budget for the UnitedKingdom on a calendar year and a financial year basis. Receipts come mainly from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) via the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in respect of its activities in implementing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the United Kingdom(see also page 00), and from the European Social Fund for United Kingdomschemes for training, transference and rehabilitation.20. The latest estimates for the calendar years to 1978 for our contributions to, and receipts from, the Community budget are as follows:  million at 1973 Survey prices	Gross Contribution	Receipts	Net Contribution1973	150	65	851974	195	120	751975	260	125	1351976	. 315	130	1851977	375	135	2401978	380	135	245In financial years to 1977-78, the figures are:					  million at 1973 Survey prices		Gross Contribution	Receipts	Net Contribution1972-73	17	3	141973-74	180	100	801974-75	210	120	901975-76	270	125	1451976-77	330	135	1951977-78	375	135	24021. The figures in the final column of the second table in paragraph 19abovcdiffer in the earlier years from those in Table 2.2 because the latter ineludeonce-for-all contributions to the European Investment Bank and to the european coal and Steel Community. The payments to the European Investment Bankare, first, the paid-up subscriptions to the capital of the Bank amounting to 37-5 million payable during the first 2\ years of membership; and seconda contribution to the reserves of the Bank, amounting to approximately  20million payable over the same period. Two of the five instalments of thesecontributions have been paid so far. The investment in the reserve funds of theEuropean Coal and Steel Community is about  24 million paid in three equalannual instalments. (The sums mentioned in this paragraph are at current prices.)22. All the estimates given above are based on a rate of 2-4 units of account to the  , which is the rate applicable to the United Kingdom contribution underthe budget regulations.
Sterling Area guarantees23. The guarantee to holders of certain official sterling reserves wasimplemented because of the fall of the sterling/dollar exchange rate in october and November 1972.24. There was no provision in Cmnd 5178 for payments in respect of sterling Area guarantees. The other main changes arise on the aid programme.The sum of  15 million which was to be brought forward from future years for1972-73 was not needed, and the bringing forward of a similar sum in 1973-74and of  5 million in 1974-75 has also proved unnecessary. As a result the effectof the rephasing envisaged in Cmnd 5178 has been eliminated. The programme has also been adjusted in the light of overall restraints on future expenditure;the combined effect is an annual average rate of increase in the aid programme for the period 1973-74 to 1977-78 of 6-3 per cent.

Receipts from this source are included inTable 2.2: Overseas Services.1. Cmnd 5178 explained that the quinquennium covered by the 1972Survey contained elements of both the old system of agricultural support in theUnited Kingdom and the new system under the common agricultural policy(CAP) of the e.c.. The White Paper also pointed out that the projected level ofexpenditure would be affected by decisions yet to be taken, particularly about thelevel of guaranteed prices and production grants. In some degree this willcontinue to apply throughout the transitional period ending in 1978. During thepast year however much progress has been made in developing the futurepattern of agricultural support, particulars of which appear in the relevantparagraphs below.Market support operations under the CAP2. Expenditure under this heading relates to the costs of the InterventionBoard for Agricultural Produce in implementing the CAP system of support.Expenditure forecasts are made up of several elements; mainly the net cost of commodities bought into intervention and subsequently sold; the gross cost ofincentives for private storage or denaturing; export refunds on third countrytrade; and, in 1973-74 and 1974-75, import and export refunds in respect ofintra-community trade (monetary compensatory amounts). The gross cost ofthe general butter subsidy amounting to  16 million in 1973-74 and  18 million in 1974-75 is also included; half of this is financed by the Guarantee Section ofthe Agricultural Fund.

Under the Treaty of Accession the United Kingdom deficiency payments for those products supported by the CAP must be ended by 1978. The guaranteeson beef and rye.have already been discontinued and those for eggs and sugar beet will end in 1974; in addition, as a result of higher world prices the estimateof the cost of the price guarantees has been reduced substantially in 1972-73and 1973-74 and to some extent in 1974-75. The reduction in 1974-75 reflects the residual effect of high market prices for the 1973 cereal crops on guaranteepayments in that financial year. For subsequent years the estimates assumed return to more normal price levels, with the level of deficiency paymentsreducing as the CAP support system takes over under the transitional arrangements.4. The outturn for 1972-73 and the estimates for 1973-74 and 1974-75include the cost of implementing the milk guarantee to producers which arises from the Governments policy of holding the retail price of milk at the 1971level for the present.
5. A continuation of deficiency payments has been assumed for other products potatoes, wool and sheep to which the CAP does not apply. Thefigure for 1973-74 takes account of the currently high market prices and the recovery of past deficiency payments for wool.Production grants and subsidies, capital grants and support in special areas6. Prior to the reductions in the rates of grant announced following the1973 Annual Review of Agriculture, it was estimated that expenditure on grants and subsidies would be substantially in excess of previous published forecasts.The present forecasts take account of the reductions made in rates of grants, offurther reductions in production grants and subsidies to be decided uponfollowing the 1974 Annual Review, of changes resulting from e.c. schemes andof the application over the transitional period of CAP arrangements.7. Allowance has been made for a national scheme to succeed the horticulture-culture Improvement Scheme and for grants to apple and pear growers facingspecial difficulties as a result of entry into the e.c.. The figures take account ofthe introduction from January 1974 of the Farm and Horticulture development scheme which implements e.c. Directive 72/159; the cost of this Scheme will bemore than offset by the consequential modifications to national schemes,principally the Farm Capital Grant Scheme (FCGS). Following the 1973Annual Review the main rate of grant under the FCGS was cut, as were therates of the calf subsidy, producing savings of approximately  23 million a year from 1974-75 onwards.8. The figures for support in special areas make provision for a continuation of the hill sheep and hill cattle subsidies and winter keep supplements.Relationship of expenditure on agricultural support to policy objectives9. The economic conditions and prospects of agriculture in the UnitedKingdom are reviewed by Ministers each year and their conclusions are published in the Annual Review White Paper. The most recent of these White Papers was published in March 1973, Cmnd 5254. A great deal of supporting information about the industry is contained in the statistical tables appended to the white papers. This information, which relates mainly to the most recent 5 years,provides a detailed analysis of the current situation from which Ministers can obtain a broad indication of future developments. In addition to giving detailed information about individual commodity trends, the tables provide a broadeconomic background of developments in farm structure, efficiency and labour productivity, net farm income, and so on.10. The Annual Review does not however attempt to make precise fore-casts for the future of agricultural production, resource use, and any associatedpublic expenditure in support of agriculture. Nor are the objectives of agri-cultural support policy defined in terms of specific levels of output. estimates of this kind depend heavily on factors which cannot be predicted reliably, suchas world supply and demand for agricultural products and developments in agricultural technology. The large movements in world cereal prices between1972 and 1973 illustrate the difficulties of prediction. In the future, the develop-ment of the e.c. Common Market policies will, of course, be an increasingly important factor.
11. For these reasons the estimates of public expenditure on agricultural support are not directly related to the achievement of specific levels of output.They represent projections of the estimated cost of maintaining existing supportpolicies, modified to take account of known major changes, notably thosearising from entry into the e.c..Other assistance to agricultural production, food processing and marketing12. This includes other expenditure by the agricultural departments on, forexample, agricultural research, advisory services, and the eradication and controlof animal disease. It makes provision for payments to sugar refiners of about 11 million in 1973-74 and for some continuation of these payments in 1974-75.Levy receipts will be an offset to this expenditure. It also covers expenditure onthe bacon stabiliser and the consumer sugar subsidy which were terminated earlyin 1973-74.Covent Garden Market Authority13. The figures relate to capital expenditure on the construction of theNew Covent Garden Market at Nine Elms.Central and miscellaneous services14. Central services comprise the main expenditure by the agricultural departments on staff costs and administration of the agricultural and foodprogrammes. Because most of the staff are engaged on a variety of activities,there are few instances where these costs can be attributed to individual pro-grammes. Examples where costs can be attributed are the Agricultural Develop-ment and Advisory Service and staff of the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory(attributed to Other Assistance to Agricultural Production) and staff of the intervention Board for Agricultural Produce (attributed to market supportunder the CAP).15. Miscellaneous services include the staff costs and maintenance of theRoyal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Wakehurst Place and Edinburgh, expenditureon land management and small holdings, publicity and miscellaneous grants etc.including subscriptions to international organisations.Fisheries16. The objective of this programme is to promote a stable fishing industryin the United Kingdom and at the same time to reduce the nation&apos;s dependence on imports. The main expenditure under this heading relates to grants and loans for new vessels and equipment, improvement of harbours, research and develop-ment in connection with the industry, fishery protection in Scottish waters andin 1973-74 support for trawler operations in Icelandic waters. The expenditureon some of these depends on the industry&apos;s plans for capital investment and other factors which cannot be forecast with accuracy. The Government decided not toextend the white fish and herring subsidies beyond 31 July 1973.Forestry17. This item covers the activities of the Forestry Commission in pro-promoting in Great Britain the interests of forestry, the establishment and main-tenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply
of timber. Finance is provided from the Forestry Fund comprising all sumsreceived from trading and other activities and an annual grant-in-aid. the survey figures consist of interest on capital, depreciation and the cash require-ment the grant-in-aid; the last item decreases gradually over the survey period from  15-3 million to  13-8 million because of increasing trading receipts.18. The Forestry Commission is carrying out a combined planting andrestocking programme of up to 22,000 hectares a year. It will increase the size of its forestry estate from about 770,000 hectares, to about 860,000 hectares atthe end of the quinquennium with a plantable reserve of about 100,000 hectares.About 9-6 million cubic metres (9 million tons) of timber will be produced andsold. Recreational facilities will be improved by the construction of 4 majorand 25 minor information centres, the development of 40 sites, for tents,caravans and holiday cabins and the provision of 200 picnic places withassociated car parking facilities and forest trails and walks.19. As the result of changes announced in the Consultative Document&quot;Forestry Policy&quot; issued in June 1972, the Commission has been set a target rateof return on its notional capital of 3 per cent in real terms. The form of itsaccounts is being revised to bring out its performance in relation to this target,allowance being made for planting undertaken for social reasons which isexpected to yield less than the target rate. The amount of (notional) capital isbeing substantially reduced. The effect of this reduction on the interest charged a major element in the Survey figures is to produce substantially lower totalsthan for past Surveys, though the interest element continues to be responsiblefor the upward trend in the Survey totals.20. As the Forestry Authority the Commission undertakes research intoall branches of forestry, controls felling in private woodlands and providesgrants and technical advice to private woodland owners. The estimates for grants to the private sector- covered by the grant-in-aid do not reflect changesin arrangements which are currently under discussion.CHANGES IN EXPENDITUREAgricultural support21. High market prices for guaranteed products have substantially reduced the estimated cost of implementing the guarantees, mainly cereals and fatstock,particularly in 1972-73 (- 151 million) and 1973-74 (- 164 million). provision has been made to give effect to the cuts in the calf subsidy and in the basic rateof grants under the FCGS announced in March 1973 as well as further reductions in production grants and subsidies to be decided upon following the 1974Annual Review.22. Increases in the cost of agricultural support will arise from the schemefor special assistance to apple and pear growers and the introduction of the beefincentive scheme under the CAP. The figures also reflect additional expenditure under the milk guarantee. Latest estimates also show increases in the take-upof existing grants and subsidies including capital grants. In the case of marketsupport under the CAP the outturn for 1972-73 was less than forecast as thesupport buying of commodities did not materialise to the extent expected and claims for denaturing, production subsidies and export refunds were not received
as quickly as expected. The main changes in 1973-74 and 1974-75 are due to theintroduction of the general butter subsidy and the payment of import and exportrefunds on intra community trade. The net cost of intervention buying has been revised upwards, throughout the whole period.23. The net effect of all these changes is to leave the total cost of agricultural support, as compared with Cmnd 5178, virtually unchanged in 1973-74 and1974-75, but to produce savings of  97 million and  85 million in 1975-76 and1976-77.Other changes24. Government decisions on certain food policies have resulted in increases in 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75. The changes comprise the extension of thearrangements for stabilising sugar prices and payments in respect of the refiningand marketing of Commonwealth sugar, offset by savings resulting from thetermination of the bacon stabilisation scheme. Under the fisheries programme,increased provision in 1973-74 is due mainly to expenditure in support of the deep sea fleet operating in Icelandic waters and increases in grants and loans for new vessels and equipment. The full effect of the decision not to extend the fishing subsidies will arise in 1974-75 and later years.25. The net effect of all these changes is to reduce expenditure as comparedwith Cmnd 5178 by  23 million in 1973-74, this saving rising to  43 million by1976-77.

Policies for the development of industry in areas in need of special assistance have been followed by successive Governments since before the war.The 1972 Industry Act introduced regional development grants and replacedselective assistance under the Local Employment Act, 1972 by a new and extended scheme of flexible selective assistance under Section 7. At the same timethe assisted areas were extended. The provision of factories under the local employment Act, 1972 continues as does the use of Industrial DevelopmentCertificates to influence the location of industry.2. There are great difficulties in measuring the effects of regional assistance on employment migration and the structure of industry in the assisted areas. Thedevelopment of the economies of the regions cannot be isolated from economictrends in the country as a whole. It is particularly difficult to isolate and measure the effects of particular instruments of policy. Some evidence on the subject was given to the Trade and Industry Sub-Committee of the Expenditure Com-mittee. In any case, it will not be possible to attempt an assessment of theeffects of present policies, which were revised in 1972, for some time.Regional development grants3. Regional development grants are made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery, principally in manufacturing industry, at the rate of22 per cent in the special development areas and at 20 per cent in the develop-ment areas. Grants are also made at 20 per cent towards the cost of buildings inthe enlarged intermediate areas, and, in the case of a building or any worksprovided before 22 March 1974, in the derelict land clearance areas. (the geographical coverage of these assisted areas is shown on the map at Annex Cof Cmnd 4942). The grants are available to firms already established in the assisted areas on the same basis and at the same rates as to incoming firms.This will encourage development from within the areas themselves and provide an incentive for improving their efficiency and competitiveness.Provision of land and buildings4. The forecasts cover the continuing development of the industrialestates and the provision of factories under the Local Employment Act, 1972.

Provision is made for assistance, on a selective basis, to industry inthe development and intermediate areas under Section 7 of the Industry Act,1972. This assistance supplements the basic incentive of regional developmentgrants. The assistance includes, for projects which provide additional employ-ment, interest relief grants towards the cost of finance obtained from commercialsources, or loans at favourable rates. For modernisation or rationalisationprojects which maintain or safeguard existing employment, and where thenecessary finance cannot reasonably be obtained from the market, loans areavailable at broadly commercial rates. As announced by the Minister for industrial Development on 23 July 1973 investment proposals from the ship-building industry for individual projects in the assisted areas will be consideredunder this heading (see paragraph 25 below).Other regional support6. This heading includes expenditure by the Development Fund and bythe Highlands and Islands Development Board.Regional employment premium7. At present no account is taken of any extension beyond 1974 of the premium, which is paid in respect of manufacturing establishments in develop-ment areas; though there is provision for residual claims into 1975-76. once the precise form of phasing out the premium is decided, this provision willrequire amendment.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of the Local Employment Act, 19728. Expenditure under the Local Employment Act, 1972, on building grants,loans and operational and removal grants (now superseded by regional develop-ment grants and the other forms of selective assistance available under theIndustry Act, 1972) is expected to terminate by the end of the Survey period.
Industrial innovationGeneral industrial research and development9. This heading includes the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s industrial research Establishments and Computer Aided Design Centre; support for industrial Research Associations; certain extra-mural research arid develop-ment and Other support. The major part of the expenditure on these activitiescomes within the responsibility of the Requirements Boards set up in acfcofdaricewith the policy set out in &quot;Framework for Government Research and Develop-ment&quot; (Cmnd 5046). The heading also covers support for the National ResearchDevelopment Corporation.10. The Industrial Research Establishments Undertake work for Govern-ment Departments, for other public authorities and for industry. They includethree multi-purpose establishments (National Physical Laboratory, NationalEngineering Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory) and two morespecialised establishments (Laboratory of the Government Chemist, and safety in Mines Research Establishment). Extra-mural support includes terminalassistance to the hovercraft industry, work on materials and marine technology and support for the Design Council. From 1973-74 onwards the forecastsprovide for the cost of repayment work carried out by the Natural EnvironmentResearch Council and some non-nuclear research and development undertaken by the Atomic Energy Authority. Their inclusion, as a result of Cmnd 5046, isthe main reason for the rise in the forecasts between 1972-73 and 1973-74.The rise in expenditure between 1973-74 and 1977-78 is due mainly to a plannedincrease in the extra-mural work supported by the Requirements Boards.Technological and industrial sponsorship11. Provision is made for assistance to mineral exploration, under the mineral Exploration and Investment Grants Act, 1972, and for a variety ofother measures of support for the engineering industries and for industry generally. Methods of support include cost-sharing research and developmentcontracts with industry, pre-production purchases of advanced machinery andequipment, and grants to the National Computing Centre.Aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance     . r*ob&quot;:     vfoS12. Government assistance towards launching &quot;civil aircraft arid&apos;aeto-engine projects has been a policy of successive Governments since the war, onthe grounds that the scale of expenditure involved, and the risks, are too greatfor the firms alone to bear. The public expenditure is designed to ensure thatthe United Kingdom firms are able to compete internationally and to play an effective role in a strong, profitable European industry. Support for any new projects will be based on their relevance to these criteria, the extent to whichthe economic criteria applied to public investment generally can be met^ andany other considerations relevant in particular cases.Aircraft and aero-engine general research and development programme13. This covers expenditure on general research and development work in industry, the universities and Government aviation R &amp; D establishments on,for example, the reduction of aero-engine noise and future types of civil aircraft and aero-engines.
Concorde14. As in previous years, the Concorde estimates provide for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s share of the development costs and for support for. theproduction programme. The figures for. development expenditure take accountof the latest UK/French estimates, while those for production (which are netof sales receipts) take account of a slower build up of the work. All these figures are subject to a review of the Concorde programme which will take place withthe French Government in the near future.RB211.. ,   .,. ,7 .\ &apos; ,15. The estimates for the completion of development of the RB211-22engine and for any losses which Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd may incur on the first555 engines show a substantial reduction compared with Cmnd 5178 revalued.This arises largely from the expectation of a smaller production loss than wasearlier estimated.Other aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance16. The estimates include provision to enable Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltdto complete the purchase of the Rolls-Royce Ltd assets, for which  30 million was paid on account in 1970-71. Of the balance of  62&quot;3 million, Rolls-Royce(1971) Ltd has paid  27 million. The remaining payment of  35-3 millionrepresents an addition in 1973-74 to Cmnd 5178 revalued.17. The other main items included are expenditure on the M45H engine( 8.4 million over the period), which Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd are developingfor the German/Dutch VFW 614 aircraft, and Government support for theHS 146 aircraft ( 42 million over the period), as announced by the Ministerfor Aero-space on 19 August 1973. The HS 146 expenditure is an increase onCmnd 5178 revalued. No provision has been made for any unapproved aircraft or aero-engine projects.Space18. The forecasts provide for the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the european space Research Organisation^ applications satellite programmes and of thethree new space programmes agreed at the European Space Conference inJuly. Provision is also made for asmall continuing^programme of nationalresearch and development work.Nuclear :  -19. The greater part of the expenditure under this heading is for research and development by the Atomic Energy Authority. Provision is also included for support to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd&apos; for participation in international collaboration on the gas centrifuge process for enriching uranium and for someother miscellaneous items of nuclear expenditure.20. Nuclear reactor research and development is estimated at  43&apos;5 million in 1973-74 decreasing to  22*4 million in 1977-78, the.greater part of theexpenditure being on development of the sodium-cooled fast reactor. provision is also made for continued development of thermal reactors. Adjustments tothe forecasts may be needed in the light of decisions soon to be taken on the choice of thermal reactors for future development and installation.
General support for industrySelective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings21. This heading covers assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act,1972, together with the  40 million assistance to International Computers(Holdings) Ltd which is being given under the Science and Technology Act,1965, during the period 1972-73 to 1976-77.22. Section 8 of the Industry Act, 1972, gives general powers for financialassistance to industry where it is in the national interest, likely to benefit the economy, and cannot appropriately be provided in any other way. provision has been made only for projects which have been approved or are currentlyunder consideration. The financing of any further projects is a potential callon the contingency reserve.Promotion of tourism23. This heading includes grants in aid to the British Tourist authority and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, expenditure on touristprojects in the development areas under Section 4 of the Development of tourism Act, 1969, and, up to 1975-76, provision for assistance to the hotelindustry under Part II of the Act. The forecasts allow for some increase in expenditure on development area projects and the grants-in-aid over the survey period.Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending24. Refinance of guaranteed shipbuilding credit is provided to the bankspartly by the Issue Department of the Bank of England and partly by theDepartment of Trade and Industry. In accordance with the policy of phasingout the Bank&apos;s refinancing commitment, the figures include provision for theDepartment to assume responsibility for the total refinance requirement.Estimates for 1974-75 onwards are lower than in Cmnd 5178 largely becausethe Bank&apos;s commitment will have been reduced more quickly in 1973-74 thananticipated.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry25. Special assistance to Govan Shipbuilders Ltd and to Cammell LairdLtd, and construction grants on a tapering scale under Section 11 of the industry act, 1972, are included under this heading. As announced by the Minister for industrial Development on 23 July, 1973, investment proposals from the shipbuilding industry for individual projects in the assisted areas will be con-sidered under Part II of the Industry Act, 1972, with the same favourable terms for modernisation schemes which do not increase employment as are normallygiven for those that do. No specific provision has been made; expenditure willbe met from the provision for selective assistance under Section 7 of the industry act, 1972 (see paragraph 5 above).Other support services26. The heading covers mainly residual items and the forecasts includereceipts from the realisation of the assets of the Industrial reorganisation corporation, miscellaneous loan repayments, accelerated expenditure onmachine tools, and the Industrial Investment Scheme for assistance to the aluminium industry.
Investment grants27. Provision is made for expenditure on investment grants arising fromcontracts entered into by industry before 27 October 1970. Expenditure for theperiod 1973-74 onwards is now expected to be higher than that assumed in cmnd 5178.Support for nationalised industries (other than the transport industries)Compensation for price restraint28. The Government have introduced legislation to authorise the paymentof compensation to the Post Office and the gas and electricity industries for theeffects of holding down their prices for reasons of counter-inflationary policy,resulting in current account deficits. It is still too early to determine the amount involved for 1973-74, but this has provisionally been put at  175 million. It hasbeen assumed that further compensation will be required in 1974-75, and thepublic expenditure figures include  175 million for that year also, but this isof an even more provisional character.Assistance to the coal industry29. The heading covers assistance to the coal industry up to the year 1975-76under the Coal Industry Act, 1973. The Act allows for additional assistance upto 1977-78, subject to affirmative resolution; if the powers were extended in thisway, the additional expenditure would be met from the contingency reserve.Government policy towards the coal industry has two complementary objectives.First, to maintain employment in areas where other opportunities are few andto provide a basis for continuing output, while the industry is progressingtowards viability. Second, to finance a special scheme for payments to redundantmineworkers and to help the National Coal Board with the cost of other socialgrants, including premature pensions where appropriate.30. The following table shows employment and output figures from1968-69:Year	Average manpower at Collieries (thousands)	NCB output (million tons)1968-69......	............      336-3	159-61969-70   ..............	............      305-1	146-41970-71       ......	.............      287-2	141-61971-72   :  ...              ...	......      ......      281-5	119-71972-73       .........	............      2680	140-other compensation31. This includes compensation to the Electricity Boards in Great Britainand to the British Gas Corporation, in respect of the acceleration of investment for employment reasons and provision for the proposed scheme for benefits to steelworkers made redundant from January 1973.
Safety and product quality and other services32. This heading includes the costs incurred in connection with electricity and gas meter examining, safety and health in mines and quarries, the NuclearInstallations Inspectorate, and oil storage for civil purposes. It also covers thecost of offshore geological studies for which no provision was made in Cmnd5178.International tradeExport promotion and trade co-operation33. In addition to the Export promotion programme which is directed by the British Overseas Trade Board, the heading covers subscriptions to international trade organisations. The additional expenditure proposed for the forward years compared with Cmnd 5178, revalued, reflects the new and improvedexport promotion measures instituted by the British Overseas Trade Board andthe increased response by industry to the forms of assistance available.Refinancing of fixed rate export credits34. This covers partial refinancing.. by the Export Credits guarantee department of guaranteed advances made by the clearing banks in respect ofthe steadily growing volume of exports financed on credit of two years or over.The aim of the refinancing arrangements is to ensure the continuing availability of fixed rate finance for exports where contracts involve heavy cash outlays andlengthy periods of manufacture and payment. The figures make provision forthe running-down of the refinancing commitment incurred by the Bank ofEngland prior to March 1972. The totals for 1974-75 and 1975-76 are lower than in Cmnd 5178 and reflect more recent estimates of the level of fixed ratecredit outstanding.Regulation of domestic trade and industry and consumer protection35. Provision is made for the Patent Office and associated internationalsubscriptions; the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s Insurance and Com-panies Divisions and the Insolvency Service, the Monopolies and MergersCommission and expenditure on standards and quality assurance. The lastincludes the grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution and the cost ofthe Metrication Board.Other information36. The Annual Report on the Industry Act, 1972, contains a more detailed breakdown of expenditure by the Department of Trade and industry under this Act and on regional assistance generally, together with furtherbackground material. Information on the output and employment of individual industries can be found in the Monthly Digests and Annual Abstracts of statistics.Functioning of the labour market37. This programme aims to improve the functioning of the labour marketthrough the employment, training and other labour market services providedby the Department of Employment. It also includes expenditure by the Depart-ment of the Environment on job centres and on government training centres,and by local authorities on the Youth Employment Service.
38. Under the Employment and Training Act, 1973 a Manpower services commission will be set up on 1 January 1974 to implement, through its Employ-ment Service and Training Services Agencies, the Government^ policies set outin. Cmnd 5250 &quot;Employment and Training: Government Proposals&quot;. TheTraining Services Agency is expected to be brought under the Commission from1 April 1974 and the Employment Service Agency from 1 October 1974. TheCommission will be financed by grant-in-aid; and the expenditure of the Man-power Services Commission and its Agencies is included in the provision forthis programme.39. Certain of the Department&apos;s schemes for training, employment transfer and rehabilitation of the handicapped (paragraphs 42, 45 and 47 below) areeligible for assistance from the European Social Fund. Such receipts are takeninto account in the net contribution to the e.c. etc (Table 2.2).Employment Services and Industrial Rehabilitation40. The main expenditure under this heading is on the Department^placing service. The Employment Service Agency&apos;s programme for modernisingand improving its services was outlined in December 1972 in the publication&quot;Into Action&quot;. The first job centres have now been opened with encouragingincrease in the use of the service by employers and job seekers and in theplacings achieved. The new computer-assisted Professional and ExecutiveRecruitment Service was also successfully introduced in March 1973 and begancharging fees for its services in June 1973.41. Provision is made for a continuing programme of improved offices and working systems. The following table gives figures for past and future years for placings. The figures for future years take account of past experience and of improvements flowing from the development of both the generalisedand specialist employment services.Thousand	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-781.

The improvements to the Employment Transfer Scheme referred to in cmnd 5178 led to a marked increase in the number of persons assisted totransfer last year and provision has been made for a further increase as a resultof additional measures to encourage the mobility of persons in the assisted areasmainly by financially assisting people looking for jobs away from home.Because of the improvement in employment the number of movements from non-assisted areas is not expected to be so high from 1973-74 onwards as in theprevious two years.

Cmnd 5250, &quot;Employment and Training: Government Proposals&quot;,explained the changes which would be made from the dates of local government reorganisation in the responsibilities of Local Education Authorities for youthemployment and in the method of financing the Youth Employment Service.They do not affect the expenditure forecasts as the costs to local authorities of the increased scope and coverage of the Service will be offset by the savingsarising from the transfer of certain unemployment benefit and other work tothe Department.44. Provision is made for the salaries and administrative expenses of the manpower Services Commission.45. The Department provides specialised placing services for disabled persons together with facilities for rehabilitating about 1,400 persons a year in industrial Rehabilitation units. These services are being reviewed. Two docu-ments have been issued a discussion paper &quot;Resettlement Policy and services for Disabled People&quot; and a consultative document on &quot;The Quota Scheme for disabled People&quot;.Industrial Training46. The Training Services Agency will be responsible from 1 April 1974for implementing the Governments policies on industrial training.47. A major programme of expansion of the Governments TrainingOpportunities Scheme is under way and on 24 July 1973 the Secretary of Stateannounced increased provision from about  50 million in 1973-74 to about 100 million in 1976-77. The scheme provides for training and re-training ofadults in Training Centres, Colleges of Further Education, employers&apos;establishments, residential colleges for the disabled and other institutions. Asthe following table shows the major expansion is likely to take place in colleges of Further Education. The figures assume an average length of course of 26weeks in Colleges of Further Education (usually two terms) and of 12 weeks inemployers&apos; establishments. The average period of courses in government training Centres is about 28 weeks; the majority of courses are slightly shorter.ThousandsNumber trained(i) Government Train-ing Centres      ... 12-3(ji) Colleges of further education       ... 0-9(iii) Employers Esta-blishmcnts       ... *1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-7312-70-912-51013-62-10-715-89-560Total13-213-613-516-431-31973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-782001706023 026070270270- -: -9029033011031034012043 0560630730770Less than 100.44
48. The programme provides for funding from 1 April 1975 the administra-tive expenses of Industrial Training Boards, the cost of certain key trainingactivities and the cost of providing training services to sectors of employmentnot covered by Industrial Training Boards. The starting date was deferred from1 August 1974 as part of the economy measures announced on 21 May 1973(Hansard Col 42).49. There is residual expenditure on the special grant schemes for trainingin assisted areas which, as announced by the Secretary of State on 24 July1973, will end on 31 March 1974 in respect of Industrial Training Board schemes and has already ended in respect of other schemes.Redundancy Fund payments50. To take account of the decrease in the numbers receiving redundancy payments, the present provision for payments from the Redundancy Fund is considerably lower than that in Cmnd 5178. The number of payments variesconsiderably from year to year. In 1972-73 about 262,000 received paymentscompared with some 267,000, 242,000, 280,000 and 388,000 in the years 1968-69to 1971-72.Industrial relations and other labour market services51. This item consists of the cost of Department of Employment staff engaged on general manpower, economic policy (manpower), incomes andindustrial relations work together with the cost of the Office of ManpowerEconomics, the Commission on Industrial Relations, industrial tribunals and the Industrial Arbitration Board. It also includes provision for continuingand extending the Community Industry Scheme, so that by 1974-75, when itwill be reviewed, some 2,000 young people who have been previously unemployedmay be employed in tasks of social value. This compares with about 600 young people by the end of 1972-73.Central and miscellaneous services52. This heading includes the central salaries and general administrative expenses of the Department of Trade and Industry, including Regional Offices,and the expenses of the Price Commission and the Pay Board.53. It also covers Department of Employment expenditure on services for the seriously disabled and occupational safety and health services, interna-tional relations work (mainly the subscription to the International LabourOrganisation), and central, agency and miscellaneous services. The latter repre-sents central and common services not attributable to other employmentprogrammes and the net cost of agency services, notably the supplementary benefit work carried out on behalf of the Department of Health and social security.54. The provision for services for the seriously disabled consists mainly of grants towards the cost of Remploy Ltd., local authorities and other bodies of providing employment under sheltered conditions. A review of the provisionof sheltered employment is being undertaken. Details of the average number ofworkers previously employed and likely to be employed under shelteredconditions are given in the following table:

Details of the Departments occupational safety and health, services were given in Cmnd 5178. The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS)was set up early in 1973. The Government have announced that they acceptthe recommendations of the Robens Committee on Safety and Health at Workfor an independent statutory Safety and Health Authority and that legislation is being prepared. Various government inspectorates and EMAS will be trans-ferred to the new Commission. Full details of the work of HM factory inspectorate are given in the annual report of. Chief Inspector of Factories,Cmnd 5398.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE56. The estimates of expenditure on regional development grants arereduced considerably. A higher proportion than expected of applications for grants in the development areas has been made for investment grants ratherthan for regional development grants in respect of contracts entered intobefore 27 October 1970. This has contributed to the reduction in forecasts for regional development grants and to an increase in investment grants. Reducedexpenditure is forecast for the provision of land and buildings, and residualexpenditure under the Local Employment Act for the forward years is increasedmainly through increased expenditure on building grants.57. Expenditure on aircraft projects and assistance is increased as a resultof Government support for the HS 146 aircraft, and as a result of the finalpayment to the Receiver for the assets of Rolls Royce Ltd., but there arereductions on the RB211 and Concorde estimates.     .-JJ58; - The decision to. give additional  25.8 million assistance to InternationalComputers (Holdings) Limited has caused an increase in the provision made for selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings. Forecastsunder this heading have also been increased by the inclusion of provision forassistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act, 1972, in respect of projectsapproved or under consideration. No provision was made for these in Cmnd5178 since it was at that time too early to make meaningful forecasts.59. Estimates for the refinancing of home shipbuilding lending are lower than those given in Cmnd 5178 for 1974-75 onwards since the Bank of England&apos;scommitment is being reduced more quickly in 1973-74 than anticipated. the totals under the refinancing of export credit for 1974-75 and 1975-76 are lower than Cmnd 5178, reflecting more recent estimates of the level of fixedrate credit outstanding.
60. There are increases under support for nationalised industries (otherthan the transport industries) arising from the inclusion of provisions for compensation for price restraint in 1973-74 and 1974-75 and for a proposed scheme of payments to redundant iron and steel workers resulting from anagreement with the European Iron and Steel Community.61. The decision to defer until 1975-76 the arrangements for meetingadministrative expenses of Industrial Training Boards and financing keytraining activities results in reduced expenditure in 1974-75. The major changein the Functioning of the Labour Market programme in the later years is attributable to the further expansion of the Training Opportunities scheme. Butthere are savings resulting from phasing out the assisted area training grants and from a reduction in the anticipated expenditure of the Redundancy Fund.

These estimates of shortfall cannot be attributed to particular industries and are subject to wide margins of error.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE3. In 1972-73 capital expenditure other than fixed investment was about 75 million more than forecast in Cmnd 5178 mainly because of an increase in coal stocks.
4. The main policy changes have been the cuts in investment announced in the Chancellors statement of 21 May, amounting to some  140 million overthe period; and the recently-announced expansion of the railway capital development plan (see paragraph 36), as part of the switch in public expenditure from roads to railways and other public transport systems. More detailedexplanations are given in the notes on individual industries.FuelCoal5. The bulk of the capital investment of the National Coal Board is in mining, although its expenditure also includes solid smokeless fuel manufacture,coal merchanting, chemicals and offshore exploration and development. the colliery investment included in Table 2.5 relates to the existing programme for which the Coal Industry Act 1973 made provision, involving some improve-ments and replacement of capacity in existing mines as seams become exhausted.Estimated expenditure on mining investment over the years 1973-74 to 1977-78is little different from the figures in Cmnd 5178 revalued. Financial assistance by the Government for the Board&apos;s current account is described on page 43together with a table of output and manpower statistics.6. The investment shown in table 2.5 will allow some improvements in existing coal faces and the development of new ones, but in the light of forecasts of demand in the early 1980&apos;s and changing energy prospects the NCB arereviewing the extent to which output should be increased by increasing invest-ment in existing pits and opening new ones for which the construction periodcan be as much as ten years. Such schemes would of course involve a greaterlevel of investment than that shown in table 2.5 (which has been prepared inadvance of the completion of the Board&apos;s review and is subject to revision in thelight of the Governments decisions on it).7. The expenditure on off-shore exploration and development of establishedfields has been phased back, resulting in a fall of  7 million in the 1974-75figure compared with Cmnd 5178. The Board&apos;s estimates of expenditure on development off-shore may be revised upwards as discoveries are made.Electricity8. Investment in electricity supply has been running at a comparativelylow level in recent years as previous load forecasts have not been realised, but itis expected to rise in the next five years to meet the rising demand for electricityresulting from general economic growth. The demand for Great Britain forecast in early 1973 by the Electricity Council and the Scottish electricity boards is asfollows:Year 1973-74   1974-75   1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79Sales (million kWh)   ...... 226,929   239,931   254,221   268,472   282,970   297,620Simultaneous Maximum De-mand (SMD) (million kW)   51-0       53-5       56-3        59-2       62-2       65-2Although these forecasts are rather lower than those underlying the estimates of cmnd 5178 they represent an average growth of SMD of over 5 per cent a year over the whole period.
9. The investment in generation over the next five years (about two-thirds of the total for electricity) depends primarily on the forecast SMD six years andmore ahead since major power stations take over five years to build. A planningmargin of generating capacity over the forecast is necessary to guard againstpower cuts due to plant break-downs and exceptionally adverse weather and higher load growth than expected. The estimates in Table 2.5 provide forsufficient future orders for generating capacity to maintain a planning margin of 20 per cent over the forecast SMD; allowance is made for orders to be placedin 1974 for a pumped storage station, a conventional station, and a nuclearstation. However, orders for major power stations in 1974 and in subsequent years are subject to later confirmation in the light of future load forecasts.10. About one-third of the total investment by Electricity Boards is for the reinforcement and extension of the transmission and distribution system. Thisis dependent upon shorter term forecasts of demand for electricity and isparticularly sensitive to new business, ie the connections and reinforcement ofthe system necessary for new housing and industrial development. Again, the investment is expected to rise with the growth of demand over the period.11. There is only a broad relationship between the forecasts of demand and sales and the financial provision necessary to meet demand. The reduction in investment which would otherwise have resulted from the reduced load forecastcompared with that of 1972, has been more than offset by provision for a sub-stantially increased proportion of new generating capacity from nuclear stationsof a type yet to be chosen. These, although cheaper to run, are more costly to buildthan conventional steam stations. The increased expenditure on electricitycompared with Cmnd 5178 revalued is a consequence of the Government^intention to exploit nuclear energy as rapidly as possible.Gas12. The demand for natural gas continues to grow. Total gas sales duringthe past five years in the main markets were:million therms	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73Domestic    ......	......     3,011	3,362	3,653	4,045	4,603Commercial......	......       677	714	776	877	1,046Industrial    ......	...     ...       976	1,159	1,704	3,070	4,530Total gas sold	4,664	5,235	6,133	7,992	10,17913. The British Gas Corporation reached agreement in July 1973 with the producers of the Frigg field in the North Sea to purchase substantial furtherquantities, beginning in 1976 and rising to an estimated 1,400 million cubicfeet a day by 1978. This is equivalent to almost half the total quantity of gasdistributed by the British Gas Corporation in the financial year 1972-73. Thepurchase of gas from the Norwegian sector of the Frigg field is subject to approval of the Norwegian Government.
14. If all of this gas becomes available there will be continued expansion inthe main markets. Very tentative preliminary estimates of the breakdown are:million therms1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-78Domestic    .........      ...     5,000       5,500       5,900       6,300       6,700Commercial ...      ...      ......     1,200       1,400        1,600        1,700       1,800Industrial    ...      ...     ......     5,200       5,800       6,000       7,100       7,400Total......      ......    11,400      12,700      13,500      15,100      15,90015. At 30 September 1973, the appliances of 9.2 million customers had been converted to burn natural gas. This represents 68 per cent of all customers and includes 8.9 million domestic customers. By mid-1977 all customers will havebeen converted at a total cost which is currently estimated at  530 million. this represents a reduction of  9 million compared with Cmnd 5178 revalued atcomparable prices, which is due to savings in costs. This expenditure does not create gas industry assets and is to be recovered over a period through charges to the revenue account, and is not therefore treated as capital expenditure for national Accounts purposes.16. The present capital programme at  746 million includes provision at current estimates for absorbing Frigg gas during the Survey period. The pro-gramme for 1973-74. to 1976-77 shows a reduction of  40 million as comparedwith Cmnd 5178 revalued at comparable prices; this is in part the result pfimproved control procedures in the newly unified gas industry.Steel17. The British Steel Corporation^ capital investment programme for1973-74 to 1977-78 represents the first stage of the ten-year development and modernisation strategy approved by the Government in December 1972 and explained in Cmnd 5226.18. The early part of the period will see the commissioning of developmentsat Scunthorpe, Llanwern, Ebbw Vale, Teesside and Ravenscraig. By the end ofthe period the Corporation^ expansion at Port Talbot and the first stage of thenew Complex at Teesside will be under construction, as will a new electric-arcsteelmaking plant in Scotland, probably supported by a direct reductionplant. Modernisation and expansion of capacity for stainless and alloy steels atSheffield should be well advanced. The proportion of basic oxygen steelmakingfacilities is planned to increase from less than 50 per cent to 76 per cent of thetotal. Continuous casting capacity will also be increased and there will be substantial expenditure on modern ironmaking and rolling plant. Obsolete steel-making capacity of about 9 million tonnes is to be phased out. However, these and other developments are expected to increase the Corporation^ total produc-tion capability for liquid steel to about 31 million tonnes by 1977-78. Duringthe period the Corporation expect to reduce manpower by nearly 15 per cent to just under 200,000 by 1977-78.19. Capital expenditure during the period represents the Corporation^estimates based on specific projects in the light of the approved strategy,whereas the estimates in Cmnd 5178 were provisional. This accounts for mostof the changes since Cmnd 5178. In addition, expenditure in 1973-74 falls short
of the level previously approved because the planning of certain projects was delayed pending agreement on the new strategy announced in Cmnd 5226 ofFebruary 1973. Certain changes arise from the decision to reduce public ex-penditure announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21 May 1973;these include a reduction of  18 million in investment in 1974-75, which isnot expected to delay the implementation of the strategy. Expenditure in1973-74 will further be offset by  20 million as a result of sales of fixed assets.Post Office20. The telecommunications capital programme accounts for over 90 percent, of the total capital expenditure for the five years 1977-78; and the amountestimated for 1977-78 is about 3 per cent more than for 1972-73. The chiefobjects of the programme are to expand the telecommunications system, toimprove the quality of existing services and to meet the demand for new services.The programme within the United Kingdom provides for the supply of someeight million exchange connections over the next five years, giving a net growthwithin the period of five million exchange connections. This is to be comparedwith a net growth rate of less than four million exchange connections from1968-69 to 1972-73. The overall size of the system will thus be increased from11 million to 16 million working connections. The programme also providesfor the conversion of the few remaining manual telephone exchanges to auto-matic working; for the extension of subscriber trunk dialling facilities to allcustomers and of international subscriber dialling to about 80 per cent ofcustomers by 1977-78; for the augmentation of trunk routes&apos;to relieve traffic congestion and to meet the growth in the long distance calls; and for growth inthe telex service and data transmission terminals.21. For all these purposes investment will be made in new exchanges,&apos;extensions to existing exchange buildings and equipment, enlargement of localline networks to customers&apos; premises and increased cable capacity for telephone and other telecommunications services. About one third of the investment is forexchange equipment, including new and enlarged international exchanges to relieve congestion and to meet the continuing increase in international tele-communications traffic. Other large items are customers&apos; installations, land and buildings and local and other lines. The programme also includes some expendi-ture on exchange equipment modernisation, but the bulk of expenditure on the modernisation programme will arise after 1977-78.22. Approximately 70 per cent of the postal programme will be devoted tothe replacement of buildings that will have to be given up or which are seriously deficient in space and to buildings to provide service in new areas of population growth. Expenditure on postal plant (17 per cent of the total) willprovide for the continuation of letter mechanisation but over an extended period,and for the completion of parcel mechanisation. Almost all the remaining ex-penditure will be on the replacement of obsolete vehicles and a small expansionof the transport fleet.
23.  The table below gives some relevant statistics:TELECOMMUNICATIONS	1968-69	1972-73	1977-78Size of system (thousands)			Working telephone connections  ......	...   7,868	10,947	16,000Working telex connections.........	26	43	80Data transmission terminals      ......	5	22	50Telephone calls (millions)			Inland        ...............	...   8,627	12,490	22,500Overseas     ......      .........	26	53	127Telephones per 100 population      ......	23	32	46Telephone calls per person   .........	157	242	400posts			Mail traffic (thousand million items)	11-5	11 0	11024. The estimating changes result mainly from economies in the design of telephone exchanges, revised postal accommodation requirements and a slower rate of letter mechanisation. The policy changes are the result of government decisions on the level of public expenditure and will be achieved by reduction&apos;&quot;across a wide range of Post Office investment.Airways and airportsBritish Airways Board30. The capital investment programme of the British Airways Board whic&apos;now controls BOAC and BEA is largely concerned with the purchase of aircraft for replacement and expansion. European Division (BEA) expect to takedelivery of their first six Tristar aircraft in 1974-75 and have recently placed anorder for three more such aircraft for delivery in 1975-76. (They still hold optionsfor a further nine). Continued expansion of Overseas Divisions (BOAC) fleet ofBoeing 747 aircraft is envisaged and delivery of the fourteenth and fifteenthB747 aircraft is expected this year. In addition Overseas Division expect tointroduce Concorde into service in 1975.31. The number of passengers carried by BOAC and BEA (which now formthe main sub-divisions of the Board) has increased substantially over the last five years:BEA............

The White Paper figures show increased expenditure in 1973-74,reflecting mainly the bringing forward of the purchase of the fourteenth andfifteenth B747 aircraft. Some consequential reduction in expenditure isexpected in 1974-75 and further reductions in that year have also been madein accordance with the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement on 21 May 1973that the projected growth of nationalised industries capital expenditure was tobe restrained. Slight reductions over the Cmnd 5178 revalued figures in later years arise in the main from minor rephasing of additional B747 aircraftpurchases.
British Airports Authority33. The British Airports Authority (BAA) plans to spend  111 million overthe period 1973-74 to 1977-78, almost wholly on the development of the threeLondon and two Scottish airports at present under its control; nothing is included for capital expenditure at existing airports which BAA may in the futureacquire, but  3 million is included in 1977-78 for preliminary work on theconstruction of terminal buildings at Maplin (payments by BAA for any landbought from the Maplin Development Authority, and that Authority&apos;s exactlyoff-setting receipts, are excluded from Tables 2.5 and 2.6 respectively. Most ofthe BAA expenditure will be at Heathrow and Gatwick to cater for the increasein traffic at those airports up to 1980.  11 million is included for the developmentof Edinburgh airport; 75 per cent of that sum, plus overheads, will be contributed by the Department of Trade and Industry within a maximum agreed in accord-ance with the terms for the transfer of the airport from the Department to BAA.34. The scale of the BAA&apos;s activity is measured by the number of terminalpassengers (those whose journeys begin or end at the airports concerned) andthe number of air transport movements recorded each year.Terminalpassengers (millions)Air transport movements (thousands)Terminalpassengers (millions)Air transport movements (thousands)1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73.   16-5	18-5	21-0	23-0	25-5. 297	321	331	352	3631973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-7827-5	30-5	33-5	370	40-5estimated				375	394	414	427	44735. The estimate of BAA&apos;s capital investment is substantially the same asthat forecast last year, apart from the deferment of initial expenditure on Maplinfrom 1976-77 to 1977-78 in accordance with the Governmenfs announcement that it will not be possible to open Maplin before 1982.Surface transport industries british Railways Board36. The Minister for Transport Industries announced the main conclusionsof the review of future long-term policy for the British Railways Board on 28November 1973. The increased provision for the future level of investment reflects the Governmenfs conclusions that it should increase in the later years. provision is accordingly made for:(a) a continuing programme for the laying of continuously welded rail;(b) completion of the electrification of the West Coast main line between london and Glasgow;(c) the introduction of 125 mph high speed diesel trains and other improve-ments to the quality of passenger services;(d) improvement of the freight business.Provision has been included for the continued development of the AdvancedPassenger Train, and for continuing investment in the Board&apos;s non-railwaybusinesses.
37. Some of the increase is due to the fact that the Board has significantly reduced the extent to which assets within its approved investment programmes are leased (in which case the expenditure is not technically classed as public expenditure) rather than purchased direct. The figures for 1973-74 to 1976-77have been increased to take account of this.38. Provision has also been included for the Channel Tunnel and Maplinrail links as follows:  million1973-74       1974-75       1975-76       1976-77       1977-78Channel Tunnel    ......     - - - 16-5 24-0Maplin       .........     0-3 0-6 1-3 2-2 2039. The British Railways Board&apos;s investment in commuter railways inLondon and the South East and the Passenger Transport. Areas is treated asinfrastructure expenditure and appears under Surface Transport (Table 2.6).Total capital expenditure by BRB is therefore expected to rise from some 135 million in 1973-74 to about  245 million in 1977-78.British Transport Docks Board40. The Board has 19 docks which handled 84 million tons of freight in1972. The investment figures for British Transport Docks Board are lower thisyear than last, chiefly because some of the proposed development at Southamptondid not in the event materialise. The bulk of the firm plans which the Board haveare for development at Southampton, the Humber and South Wales.British Waterways Board41. Following the decision late last year that those waterways controlled bythe British Waterways Board should not be transferred to the Regional water authorities as had previously been planned, the Department of the Environmentis reviewing long-term policy with the Board. The provision in Cmnd 5178revalued has meanwhile been retained.National Bus Company42. The National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries, with a fleet totalling some20,000 buses and coaches, operated nearly 750 million vehicle miles in 1972. Mostof the Company&apos;s investment is in replacement buses suitable for one-man opera-tion; in 1972 some 50 per cent of their stage carriage mileage was travelled by such buses. Some expenditure is also incurred on the improvement of facilities at bus stations and depots.National Freight Corporation43. The National Freight Corporation^ operating subsidiaries have about10 per cent of the &quot;for hire&quot; road haulage market. The Corporation^ plannedinvestment, cut back as a result of the adverse trading conditions in 1971 and1972, is now expected to return to a higher level. The major part of their invest-ment is in replacement of lorries, trailers and containers and in the provision ofterminal facilities.
Scottish Transport Group44. The established pattern of capital expenditure by the Group is expectedto continue for the next five years during which approximately 60 per cent oftheir programme is for the replacement of buses. Most of the remainder is forthe introduction by 1975-76 of roll-on/roll-off vehicle ferries and associatedterminals for both major and minor routes; this expenditure is in accordancewith Government policy as announced by the Secretary of State for Scotland on18 April 1972 for development of sea transport to the Scottish Islands and should result in more efficient and profitable services.Transport Holding Company45. The Transport Holding Company was dissolved on 31 March 1973,after the sale of its remaining subsidiary.

For the first time in this series of White Papers, all public expenditureon roads and public transport (other than nationalised industry commercialinvestment which is included in Table 2.5) is brought together in a single section.This presents a comprehensive picture of the financial implications of the Govern-menfs proposals for surface transport. If reflects the new policies outlined in thestatement by the Minister for Transport Industries on 28 November 1973 andforeshadowed in the Government Observations on the Second Report of theExpenditure Committee (Cmnd 5366). These policies will ensure that the re-sources required to meet economic and social needs are used to the best effect.They will involve a major switch of resources from expenditure on roads tosupport for public transport. They set out the future strategy for railways; for thecontinued development of the national trunk road network; for the diversion of heavy lorries to special routes, speeding the movement of goods, and protectingtowns and villages; for support of public urban transport and restraint of cars intowns; and for roads in towns. .2. Table 2.6 shows what those policies mean for public expenditure,namely, increased expenditure on railways, and on other forms of public transport (including subsidies by local authorities to the revenue of public transport); rising expenditure on the national road network and on road maintenance generally, though at a slightly lower rate; less expenditure on urbanroad building and increases in income from car parking.3. The table also shows other changes in the financing of roads and trans-port since the publication of the last White Paper on public expenditure (Cmnd5178).4. From 1975-76 onwards local authorities in England and Wales will(subject to Parliamentary approval) be assisted in comprehensive transportplanning by a new form of grant. Under the provisions of the Local government bill introduced on 31 October 1973, several existing specific grants will bereplaced by a new transport supplementary grant (TSG) to aid local authority

Local authorities will be expected to submitannually proposals for transport policies for their areas. They will be free of the pressures exerted by the specific grant system towards particular policies. Theintroduction of TSG does not, of itself, involve increased support for transportexpenditure, but better distribution of that support. Local authorities (especiallyin urban areas) are likely to shift resources from major road schemes to public transport. Changes to the arrangements for supporting local authority transportexpenditure in Scotland are also being considered.RoadsGeneral5. The expenditure figures in Table 2.6 fall into two main groups: new construction and improvement, and maintenance. &quot;Other expenditure&quot; iri eachcategory includes lighting and parking, and for the first&quot;time some aspects of road safety expenditure.6. The roads continue to carry additional freight and passenger trafficarising from economic growth and the increase in living standards. Heavy lorrieshave trebled over the past 10 years and car ownership has increased by 40 percent in 7 years. New and improved roads are essential to cater for this growth,but they cannot provide the complete answer. Traffic in towns must be restrained,and a larger share of resources diverted to public transport.England New Construction and improvement: The programme. The long-term objectives for the inter-urban network (mainly motor-ways and trunk roads) remain those set out by the Government in June 1971.It is intended now to provide more by-passes of smaller towns and villages to divert heavy lorries away from residential areas, and to restrict them to a net-work which links the main industrial centres and the ports. There have been
reductions in the rate of growth in the programme for motorway and trunk roads. These have been to provide for a switch of resources to housing; as aresult of the reductions in public expenditure announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in May 1973, and as a result of decisions on priorities within the planned total increase in public expenditure in future years. It now often takeslonger for major road schemes to reach construction stage. The statutoryprocedures under the highway acts take more time and public participation atthe early stages will also prolong the planning process; The network is now expected to be completed by the mid 1980s.8. The rate of growth now envisaged for new construction of motorwaysand trunk roads between 1973-74 and 1977-78 is 5.5 per cent.9. It is clear that the construction of major new road networks in manyurban areas would not provide an adequate solution to the problems of conges-tion or improve the environment. Roads have to be related to all aspects of citylife. The Government accepted proposals in this sense made by the Urban Motor-way Committee, and provided measures for them in the Land Compensation Act1.973. Expenditure on local authority road schemes has also been reduced toallow resources to be diverted to the support of housing policy and to helpreduce total public expenditure in 1974-75 as announced on 21 May 1973. Thefigures also show substantial reductions in later years as a result of the Govern-menfs proposals for a change in the balance of priorities in expenditure on transport. While it will be in large measure for local authorities to decide on thebalance of expenditure between different items within the transport sector forwhich they are primarily responsible, the Government expect the new policies to lead to an appreciable reduction in proposed expenditure on roads in urban areas. It is this assumption which accounts for the major reductions in later years.England Maintenance etc.10. The programme for trunk roads includes special expenditure to achieve the initial standards proposed in the report of the Marshall Committee. A recost-ing of the requirements, and the reductions for 1974-75, mean that the work willnot be substantially completed until 1975-76. The reductions in 1974-75 will alsoset back achievement of Marshall standards on principal and other roads. Thereshould be some slowing down in the rate of expenditure on maintenance on bothurban and rural roads; and some increases in car parking charges as part of apolicy of greater emphasis on public transport.Scotland -11. The Scottish trunk road programme in the period will have two chiefaims, both closely related to the economic development and well-being of thecountry. The first is the completion of the Central Scotland motorway and dualcarriageway network, which has been the main objective of the Scottish Pro-gramme over the last decade. This network will continue to play an important part in the economic regeneration of the traditionally industrialised and heavilypopulated Central Belt of Scotland. The second, which has assumed increasing importance, is to provide improved roads to meet the urgent new transportrequirements of oil-related developments in North and North-East Scotland,
including the complete reconstruction of the A9 from Perth to Invergordon. Thefigures in Table 2.6, as well as providing for these objectives, also provide forother major improvements to trunk and local authority roads. Apart from somediversion of funds to the support of housing policy and to help reduce public expenditure, the provision for urban roads has not been reduced. Studies are however in progress to determine the relative contribution of roads and other measures to the solution of urban transport problems in Scotland. The Scottishforecasts of current expenditure by local authorities are provisional since thenegotiations on the Rate Support Grant Settlement for 1974-75 are still inprogress.Wales12. The improvement of east to west road communications across North andSouth Wales and of the road links between Wales and the major industrial and commercial areas of England are the principal objectives of the Governmenfsinter-urban motorway and trunk road programme in Wales. The westwardextensions of the M4 motorway-a project vital to the economy of industrialSouth Wales remains the dominant single item in terms of public expenditure during the period of this report.13. The reduction in expenditure on local authority urban roads forecasts for England is not expected to arise in Wales during this period. Although theprinciples of the Governmenfs new transport policies apply in Wales as inEngland the absence of many large towns, the fact that many principal road schemes in the programme are either inter-urban links or by-passes of smalltowns, and the continuing need even against the background of the currentstrategy for urban transport to improve some urban road systems, mean that theeffects of the Governmenfs new policies will not be felt until later years.Road safety14. The greater part of public expenditure on road safety, including forexample that on the Transport and Road Research Laboratory, small road schemes, the driver and vehicle testing organisations and the enforcement of road safety laws by the police and courts, appears under other headings.Expenditure by the local authorities materially contributes to road safety andre-organisation provides the opportunity to make road safety a duty of the newcounties, the Greater London Council and the London Boroughs in England andWales and the new regional and island authorities in Scotland. The Road TrafficBill published on 2 November makes provision for giving statutory force to this duty.Public surface transport15. The Government provides a wide range of financial assistance to public transport. Some grants, such as support grants to nationalised transport indus-tries and bus and ferry grants, help to sustain existing services, while others areaimed at improving the public transport services in general, particularly those provided by nationalised industries and local authorities in the commuter areas.16. Government assistance to public surface transport includes bus fuelgrants which are payable in respect of about 1,700 million miles of stage carriageservice run each year and a 50 psr cent contribution to grants male by localauthorities towards the cost of maintaining certain rural bus and ferry services.
17. Further substantial government assistance is currently provided throughcapital grants to local authorities and nationalised industries to encourage major improvements to public transport facilities particularly those serving commuters.The form of this assistance will be somewhat changed with the introduction ofthe new transport supplementary grant after April 1975 with increased emphasisplaced on comprehensive transport plans for each area. Provision has been madefor a progressive increase in this type of investment. The figure for each year is higher than in Cmnd 5178 rising to an increase of some  30 million in 1976-77.This expenditure is shown as infrastructure expenditure in Table 2.6 and includesapproved costs attributable to the Liverpool Terminal Loop and ExchangeCentral Link, the Tyneside Rapid Transit System, the electrification of someNorth London rail services, the Heathrow Link and the Borough Marketjunction improvement. Other provision is made for expenditure on new railwayrolling stock, re-signalling schemes associated with commuter services, improve-ment to commuter lines in Scotland and for expenditure on other forms ofpublic transport such as busways, bus lanes and interchanges.18. Bus operators are expected also to continue to benefit substantially fromgrants which are available towards their major item of capital expenditure thepurchase of new buses for use on stage services (grant at the rate of 50 per cent is currently being paid in respect of about 3,600 such buses each year). Thesegrants stimulate the development of one-man operation and assist the operatorsin maintaining up-to-date fleets. Investment in new buses by municipal busoperators, Passenger Transport Executives and the London Transport Executiveappears under Other passenger transport in Table 2.6. (Grants in respect of newbuses are also paid to the National Bus Company and the Scottish TransportGroup whose investment appears under nationalised industries capital expendi-ture in Table 2.5.) Provision is included for the first time in Other passenger transport for revenue support by local authorities to transport undertakings andby the Greater London Council to the London Transport Executive (see notes on Methodology).Support to nationalised industries19. The largest item in this block represents provision for support to theBritish Railways Board (BRB). The statement by the Minister for transport industries on 28 November 1973 announced the main conclusions of the reviewof future railway policy. The review showed that as foreshadowed in Cmnd 5178wider-ranging support to the Board will in future be needed. Pending approvalof new legislation, the estimates of support required are on the existing basis.Provision is made for specific grants under the Transport Act 1968 and for the forecast deficit of the Board on revenue account which is being met throughspecial grants.20.  The other main items are:(a) BRB receive grants under section 40 of the Transport Act 1968 pendingthe elimination of surplus track and signalling capacity which is atpresent a burden on their operating account. The provision relates to expenditure over a five-year period from 1 January 1969, reflecting the progressive elimination of surplus capacity.
(b) The provision includes grants payable to the British Waterways board under section 43 of the Transport Act 1968 in respect of essentialmaintenance of the Board&apos;s waterways and on the improvement to modern traffic standards of about 400 bridges carrying public roads overthe Board&apos;s canals.(c) The National Freight Corporation receive grants under section 5 ofthe Transport Act 1968 in respect of the deficit on their subsidiary,National Carriers Limited, taken over from BRB on 1 January 1969.This provision relates to the five-year period from 1 January 1969; thefinal grant is expected to be paid in 1973-74.(d) The provision covers grant to the Scottish Transport Group in respectof losses on those Western Islands shipping services which are operated by its subsidiary, David MacBrayne Limited.Ports and shipping21. The provision for ports covers investment by public trust and localauthority ports, and grants and loans to private sector ports. The estimatesinclude expenditure on the new dock system at Seaforth on the Mersey(amounting to approximately  47 million by 1974-75), and on the new BristolWest Dock Scheme (approximately  20 million by 1976-77).Shipping services22. Most of the expenditure is directed towards the maintenance and improvement of safety at sea. The forecasts provide for increased expenditure onimproving surveillance of navigation in the English Channel. A large part of theexpenditure on search and rescue work is on the Coastguard services. Thenumber of incidents involving HM Coastguard and the number of rescueseffected has increased steadily in recent years:Number of incidents Persons rescuedApril to March 1968-69   ............ 2,444 2,878April to March 1969-70   ............ 2,592 2,675April to March 1970-71   ............ 2,919 3,550April to March 1971-72   ............ 3,518 4,324April to March 1972-73   ............ 4,460 4,109Civil aviation23. This heading covers capital expenditure both by the Civil aviation authority and by Local Authorities on aerodromes. The Department of Tradeand Industry makes a grant-in-aid to the Civil Aviation Authority to cover itsdeficit on revenue account, which is intended eventually to be eliminated, andis also responsible for a number of other services of which the main ones are the uk contribution to euro control, expenditure arising from our membership ofthe International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the costs of certain security measures at UK airports. The most important single determinant of expenditure by the Civil Aviation Authority is the number of aircraft movements handled by UK air traffic control. This directly affects the extent of provision of air traffic control services and accounts for the bulk of both current and capitalexpenditure by the CAA. It has also an important, if less direct, influence on other expenditure under this heading. Aircraft movements handled by UK air traffic control have increased steadily in recent years:1968 1969 1970 1971 1972999,389 1,063,352 1,142,796 1,217,406 1,258,031
Maplin Development Authority24. The Maplin Development Act which received Royal Assent on 25October 1973 provides for the establishment of the Maplin development authority (MDA). There will be no commitment to major construction contractson any aspect of the project until after Parliament has considered the Secretaryof State&apos;s report made under Section 2(9) of the Maplin Development Act 1973.Table 2.6 includes provisional estimates of the cost of the land reclamationwhich will be undertaken by the MDA during the forecast period. Most of thereclaimed land will be transferred to other public authorities, in particular theBritish Airports Authority and the Port of London Authority, and the rest willbe available eventually for development in accordance with the Governmentsindustrial, regional and environmental policies. No allowance is made in the table for the offsetting receipts by the MDA as the timing and amount of pay-ments are still uncertain. These transactions will, in any case, have no net effecton the total of public expenditure. In addition to expenditure by the Develop-ment Authority the Maplin project will also entail expenditure which is includedin the public expenditure totals under the appropriate functional programmes.A breakdown of expenditure on Maplin up to 1977-78 is as follows: million at 1973 Survey prices	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-Preliminary Investigations and Re-					clamation............	2	11	17	16	13Surface access and New Town					expenditure       ...      ......		:  :2;iiliJ:	4	11	25Airport      ............

This block comprises miscellaneous minor transport services as wellas the administration costs of Government Departments relating to transport.Provision has been made for the receipt of fees for services such as driving testsand vehicle tests and for minor Department of the Environment expenditure inconnection with the Channel Tunnel. The Tunnel itself will not count as public expenditure, as the construction will be carried out by the British and FrenchChannel Tunnel Companies, as explained in Cmnd 5430.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE26. Policy changes since Cmnd 5178 mainly relate to shifts in resources to change the balance of priorities in expenditure on transport on the lines set out above. They are also attributable to measures taken to curtail public expendituregenerally and to make resources available for new housing policies. The totaleffect has been to reduce roads expenditure and to increase expenditure oninfrastructure and on revenue support for bus and underground services. Cmnd5178 noted that further revenue support would be required for the BRB: the tentative forecasts of this are the main estimating changes in the block.

The forecasts include provision for the new policies on housing an-nounced in the White Papers &quot;Widening the Choice: the next steps in Housing&quot;(Cmnd 5280), &quot;Homes for People: Scottish Housing Policy in the 1970s&quot;(Cmnd 5272), &quot;Better Homes the Next Priorities&quot; (Cmnd 5339) and &quot;TowardsBetter Homes: Proposals for Dealing with Scotland&apos;s Older Housing (Cmnd5338). The White Papers state the Governmenfs plans for inter alia, reinforcingthe momentum towards home ownership and expanding the role of the volun-tary housing movement as a provider of rented housing; they reiterate the government&apos;s support for local authority building for rent where this is needed and for pressing on with slum clearance and improvement of sub-standardhousing.Subsidies2. Three main elements are included in these estimates. The first is centralGovernment subsidies in connection with the provision of housing by localauthorities, New Town authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association andother housing associations based on the new system of housing finance intro-duced by the 1972 Housing Finance Acts. The second element is rate fundcontributions mainly to the housing revenue account and in association withcentral Government subsidies. Thirdly, this item covers central Governmentand local authority expenditure on rent rebates for council tenants and rentallowances for private tenants.3. The estimates take account of the main changes expected both in the costs of providing public sector housing, and the rental income from it. The

The option mortgage scheme, which was introduced in 1968, is designedto help people with moderate incomes to buy their own homes by giving thembenefits roughly equal to those that are available to people with higher incomesthrough tax relief on mortgage interest. The subsidy scale has been extended sothat as from 1 January 1974 the subsidy will be 3  per cent for repaymentmortgages and 3 per cent for mortgages with no periodic repayment of capitalwhere the normal rate of interest is 11 per cent. About 540,000 option mortgageshave been taken out since the scheme began in 1968, although some of these will have been terminated since. The amount of subsidy payable varies not only with the total number and value of option mortgages, but also with the rate ofinterest, and this is reflected in the estimates.Grants and loans to Housing Associations. 5. The. Government believes that the voluntary housing movement, hasa major role to play in the relief of housing stress, particularly through theacquisition and improvement of tenanted property and the provision of well-managed and inexpensive rented accommodation. Provision is made accordinglyfor an increase in financial support to housing associations through grants and
loans to enable them to achieve this looked-for expansion. Until details of thenew grant system for housing associations have been worked out, the relativeneed for grants and loans cannot be assessed. For the present, increased financial support to the voluntary housing movement is accordingly treated as loans andthis accounts largely for the increasing growth of total public sector lending for housing from 1974-75.House improvement and slum clearance6. There are over a million dwellings in England and Wales which are unfitand a further 2 million dwellings which are substandard, mainly in the privately-rented sector. In Scotland there are about 180,000 dwellings which fail to meetthe statutory tolerable standard.7. The Government is continuing to promote the improvement of olderdwellings and their environment and the clearance of those houses for whichimprovement is not practicable. Improvement grants approved in Great britain in 1972 rose to a record 368,000 (Table A) whilst the total for 1973 is likely to exceed 400,000. Thereafter the estimates reflect a distinct change in emphasis.Although the special arrangements for development and intermediate areas(where 75 per cent grants have been available since 1971) will terminate in June1974, it is proposed that preferential rates of grant will be introduced in general improvement.areas and the housing action areas envisaged in the White Papers,&quot;Better Homes The Next Priorities&quot; and &quot;Towards Better Homes: Proposalsfor Dealing with Scotland&apos;s Older Housing&quot;. At the same time there will be areduction of grant aid for those private owners who are able to finance improve-ments from their own resources. Rehabilitation of council houses is expected to decline below the recent very high level of activity as the residue of olderimprovable council houses is reduced.TABLE AIMPROVEMENT GRANTS APPROVED: GREAT britain for local For housing For private Totalauthorities associations owners1968     ..........     ...      ...      40,939          2,096 84,860 127,8951969............      ...      40,436          3,190 80,263 123,8891970     .............      ...      59,468          4,110 116,379 179,9571971     ......      ...      ......      88,979          6,168 137,364 232,5111972    ...............     136,844          6,756 224,468 368,068Investment8. The main element is expenditure by local authorities on the provision ofnew accommodation for renting. The assessment of local needs for rented accommodation is a matter for the local authorities and no limit is currentlyplaced on the numbers of houses they may build to meet those needs. Overall,therefore, expenditure reflects the sum of the decisions of local housing authori-ties on their individual programmes. In recent years, the number of new dwell-ings in tenders accepted by local authorities and New Towns has decreased, asshown in Table B, and the estimates, which are lower than those in Cmnd 5178,reflect that decline. -

The estimates also reflect the Governments readiness to approveschemes of building for sale by local authorities, as a means of meeting localneeds for lower priced houses for sale which are not being met by privatedevelopers. The decision to ask local authorities to come forward with such schemes, announced in Cmnd 5280, is complementary to the Governmenfsencouragement to local authorities, New Town Development Corporations, theCommission for the New Towns and the Scottish Special Housing association to widen opportunities for home ownership by giving existing tenants theopportunity to buy their homes. In 1972 a record number of about 64,000dwellings were sold to tenants by local authorities and the New Town authorities(Table C). The estimates assume that such sales will continue at a high level.TABLE CSALE OF DWELLINGS OWNED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND NEW TOWNS:GREAT BRITAINBuilt for sale All sales1968     .........      ...........           1,711 10,5661969............      ......           1,385 9,2481970..................             976 7,6591971     ...      ...      ......      ... .    ... .         1,066 21,1701972     ................      ...           1,296 63,950Lending10. The main constituent in these figures is lending by local authorities to private individuals for house purchase, including loans made to council tenantsbuying their houses on mortgage or instalment terms. Local authorities maylend to defined categories of priority borrowers; these include the homeless,people high on a Council&apos;s waiting list or displaced by new development, and people wishing to buy older property which, would not attract a commercialmortgage..11. As indicated in Table D, between 1970 and 1972 the number of suchloans was fairlyxonstant averaging about 45,000 per year (England and Wales)to priority borrowers (excluding purchasers of council houses). However in1973-74 a rapid increase has taken place largely as a result of some erraticvariations in the supply of building society funds. Future demand for localauthority mortgages is at present exceptionally difficult to foresee. The proposalsfor stabilising the flow of mortgages from building societies should howeversmooth out the demand.TABLE DLOCAL AUTHORITIES LOANS TO PRIVATE PERSONS FOR HOUSE PURCHASE:ENGLAND AND WALESNewdwellings1968    ............      ... ...        4,29019691970197119721,8162,6052,7341,893Otherdwellings34,502.17,28041,49844,44043,309Alldwellings38,79219,09644,10347,17445,202

(1) An addition of about  190 million a year to cover the higher costs of subsidised housing and increases in rent rebates and allowances.(2) Increased assistance for fair rent housing associations in the formof additional grants and loans rising from about  46 million in1974-75 to  125 million in 1977-78.(3) Revised estimates of improvement grants and investment in thelight of new forecasts and the changes announced in Cmnd 5338and Cmnd 5339. The main effect is to increase expenditure in theearly years-that for 1973-74 is  124 million, and for 1974-75 is 111 million higher than in Cmnd 5178 revalued, but thereafter thelevel of expenditure falls below Cmnd 5178 revalued.(4) A reduction in local authority investment in new dwellings and land averaging  155 million a year over the four years 1973-74 to1976-77.(5) An extra  130 million in local authority lending for house purchase in 1973-74.

This programme covers a wide variety of services some of which will inEngland and Wales be the responsibility of the new Water Authorities, some ofwhich are the responsibility of local authorities, and some of which are theresponsibility of Central Government, or the New Town Development Corpora-tions.Capital ExpenditurePublic health Water services . From 1 April 1974, water services in England and Wales (comprisingmainly water supply and conservation, sewerage and sewage disposal, land drainage, prevention of water pollution, fisheries and amenity and recreationassociated with water) will become the responsibility of the new Water Authori-ties constituted under the Water Act 1973. These are, in the case of England, the nine Regional Water Authorities and, in the case of Wales, the Welsh NationalWater Development Authority. In this White Paper, the services which will be operated by these authorities are included under the heading &quot;Public health&quot;,although expenditure on water supply and sewerage is shown separately inthe table. This is in conformity with the normal practice of presenting services on the basis of which they are actually being operated at the date the White

It is important to note however that reorganisation will affectthe way the figures for water and sewerage in England and Wales will appear infuture public expenditure White Papers. Capital expenditure amounting inEngland and Wales to  319.2 million in 1974-75,  345-4 million in 1975-76, 363-4 million in 1976-77 and  387-6 million in 1977-78, will be controlled in away similar to the nationalised industries, i.e. by a capita! ceiling given to each authority. Separate figures for water supply and sewerage will not be provided in future, as the new multi-purpose Authorities will be treating these services asan integrated whole, and will have power to switch resources between them. Thetreatment of current expenditure is discussed at paragraph 14. In Scotlandwater supply and sewerage functions are to be transferred to regional andisland councils in 1975.3. Capital expenditure on these services prior to May 1973 was programmedin accordance with the willingness and ability of the authorities concerned toundertake the expenditure. The policy measures taken by the Government since may 1973 will result in a rate of increase in capital expenditure on water and sewerage between 1973-74 and 1977-78 of 24.9 per cent. There is expected tobe an initial check in the increase in expenditure in 1973-74 and 1974-75;thereafter a more rapid growth is assumed though from the lower base.
4. Growth in the demand for public water supplies is expected to continuethroughout the period, with consumption per head of population of 296 litresa day predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent between 1972 and 1977, and total consumption of 16 million cubic metres a day increasing by over 12 per cent.The increase in the supply of clean water means more effluent. Although expen-diture has had to be reduced below the level of Cmnd 5178, the rate of growthallowed should still remain adequate to permit additional expenditure on treat-ment to maintain the improvement in the state of the country&apos;s rivers. An indi-cation of what remains to be done is provided by the River Pollution Surveys,published this year and last.5. Methods of planning and developing the integrated management of thewater services will be developed during the period by the new Water Authoritiesin England and Wales, in co-operation with the Government. They will aim toset objectives and to assess the cost of achieving them and the benefits to be derived from them. They will attempt to draw up a timescale for the achievement of the objectives. The information collected from existing sewerage authorities on the lines explained in Cmnd 4829 produced proposals which, in the aggregate,it was plainly impossible to achieve during the period proposed. A further attempt is in progress, with the co-operation of the authorities concerned, toestablish a more realistic programme to be handed on to the new Water Authori-ties as a basis for their activities in their first year of office.6. The forecasts for land drainage in England and Wales include expendi-ture on the Thames Flood Prevention Works, of which the proposed Barrier isthe focal part. The figures for this project reflect a more realistic assessment of cost estimates than was possible when Cmnd 5178 was published. But even now the estimated overall cost is only provisional.Other public health services. The future level of expenditure on the other services in this group which include refuse collection and disposal, smoke control, public conveniences andother public health expenditure, is affected by the system of capital controlreferred to in paragraph 11 below. Within this system of control the assumptionby local authorities of wider responsibilities for improving the waste collection and disposal services is expected to require an increase in the resources allocated to this aspect of future policies for the protection of the environment. Expendi-ture on smoke control is expected to remain constant as progress with the pro-gramme to combat air pollution continues.Improvement of the environment and other localfacilities8. This group of services includes the reclamation of derelict land, theprovision of parks and recreational facilities, and of administrative services, and activities carried out under the Town and Country Planning Acts, as well as anumber of minor items of expenditure such as private street works, coastprotection, civic theatres and restaurants, retail markets, cemeteries and crema-toria.
9. The success of the derelict land reclamation programme has stemmed toa large extent from the establishment by larger local authorites of specialistteams which combine the many skills which are required in this work. One effectof local government reorganisation has been to interrupt to some extent thesmooth working of these teams in England, and during 1974-75 while new localauthorities are completing their arrangements for the management of their futureprogrammes, some slowing down in the rate of derelict land reclamation is to beexpected. In Wales, however, activity in this field is expected to maintain itsmomentum. In Scotland also, where most of the larger authorities rely on theservices of consultants, reorganisation in 1975 is espected to have a less markedeffect than in England.10. This heading includes in 1973-74 and 1974-75 provision for a specialprogramme of land acquisition for resale for private housing announced by theSecretary of State for the Environment in April 1972. The figures for 1974-75onwards include offsetting reductions for proceeds from the sale of land. over three-quarters of the sum provided has already been allocated to local authorities for proposed schemes.11. Most of the other services in the group come within the system ofcapital control which has operated in England and Wales since April 1971, andmore recently in parts of Scotland (the &quot;locally determined pool&quot;). Under thissystem an annual amount is notified to local authorities as the total within which their expenditure from borrowing on the projects which come within the poolmust be confined. Within this total however local authorities are free to spendon a wide variety of projects at their own discretion. The aim of the system is toincrease the freedom of local authorities to choose their own priorities, but itdoes mean that it is not possible to forecast with any accuracy how much will be spent on particular services.12. Indications from the two years during which the scheme has operated(1971-72 and 1972-73) are that local authorities have tended to spend rather more than expected on parks and baths, sports and recreational facilities andadministrative buildings and rather less on small sewerage schemes (which upto 1 April 1974 remain part of the pool) and waste disposal services. Some in-crease in expenditure on administrative services is to be expected since localgovernment reorganisation is creating a demand for office accommodation toreplace existing premises, some of which will be wrongly sited and inadequate forthe needs of the new authorities.Current expenditure13. After the reorganisation of the water services on 1 April 1974 current expenditure in England and Wales, mainly on sewerage, amounting to  79-8million in 1972-73 and  83-9 million in 1973-74 should be covered by currentrevenue, and will not appear in subsequent public expenditure White Papers. Thefigure for local authority expenditure in England and Wales for 1974-75 cover-ing the remaining services is based on the forecast arrived at after consultationwith the local authority associations in the course of the recent rate support grant negotiations. Local authorities will be asked to restrict their expenditure
to the extent necessary to achieve an appropriate part of the savings which theChancellor called for in his speech of 21 May.14. The figures for 1975-76 and 1976-77 follow discussions of forecastsarrived at in consultation with local authority associations but are lower thanthe figures recommended by the local authorities since the Government is not willing to accept the rates of increase in these services which the local authori-ties currently forecast. However, they will be subject to further consultationwhen the rate support grant for those years is settled. The figures for 1977-78imply continuation of the trend of the two previous years. Actual expenditure over the period of the forecasts will depend upon the expenditure decisionsmade by each local authority in the light of the rate support grant settlement for each year.15. The Scottish forecasts of current expenditure by local authorities areprovisional since the negotiations on the rate support grant settlement for1974-75 are still in progress.Royal Palaces and Royal Parks16. This item covers expenditure on the maintenance etc of the royalpalaces, and royal parks throughout the United Kingdom.Historic buildings and ancient monuments17. Provision is made for grants for the repair of historic buildings, forother related services and for expenditure on the purchase, maintenance, repair and display of ancient monuments, including emergency excavations to recordmonuments before sites are developed.18. More detailed information is available in the Annual Reports of the historic Buildings Councils and the Ancient Monuments Boards for England,Scotland and Wales and the Department of the Environments annual publica-tion, &quot;Archaeological Excavations&quot;. In 1968 there were some 10 million visitors to ancient monuments and historic buildings in the care of HM Government.Since 1970 the number of visitors has increased by at least 1 million each yearand in 1972 there were more than 14 million visitors.19. The main policy changes in this field since last year are an annual ad-dition of  300,000 from 1973-74 to the funds available for emergency excava-tions and increases of some  600,000 each year from 1973-74 for grants towardsthe cost of repair and maintenance incurred by private owners of historicbuildings, their contents and surrounding land.Environmental research20. This item covers expenditure by the Department of the Environment onits four research establishments, the Transport and Road Research Laboratory,the Building Research Establishment, the Water Pollution Research Laboratoryand the Hydraulics Research Station, on departmentally sponsored research,and on grants to research associations and other bodies. Provision is also madefor grants to the BRB&apos;s research programme at the Railway Technical Centre,Derby (where work on the advanced passenger train is in progress); and to the
London Transport Executive^ programme of rapid transit research. The growth in proposed expenditure is in recognition of the need to provide research sup-port for the Departments responsibilities which account for a very large volumeof public expenditure.21. The provision takes account of the sums transferred to the Departmentfrom the Department of Education and Science in respect of expenditure by theNatural Environment Research Council in accordance with Cmnd 5046. Pro-vision is at a lower level than Cmnd 5178 revalued because allowance has beenmade for the probability of delay in certain research projects.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE22. The main changes in the forecasts of expenditure since Cmnd 5178 have affected capital expenditure on Public health and improvement of the environ-ment and other facilities. Adjustments have been necessary to reflect the Govern-ment&apos;s priorities including those towards housing as announced in Cmnd 5820.The following are the sum of the policy reductions which have been made:  million1973-74       1974-75       1975-76       1976-77Public health............      17-9 32-8 28-3 30-8Improvement of the environment andother local facilities..........       5-7 61-5 35-3 46-9Further reductions as follows are expected as a consequence of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement on the construction industry of 8 October:  million1973-74       1974-75Public health   .........     ...............      18-2 60Improvement of the environment and local facilities     ...      ...      16-5 0-3Also as a matter of policy, local authorities are expected to restrain the rate of growth in their current expenditure. For England and Wales the expectedreduction in 1974-75 and the need to continue their reduction in subsequent years were discussed at the recent rate support grant negotiations with localauthority associations.23. The main estimating change on capital expenditure results from therephasing of the special programme of land acquisition for resale for privatedevelopment included under Improvement of the environment and other localfacilities which produces more expenditure in 1973-74 and 1974-75 and a slowing down in the expected rate of subsequent, receipts from sales. The overalleffect is to increase net expenditure as follows:  million1973-74 1974-75 1975-763-8 18-7 11-3

Most of this expenditure is incurredinitially by local authorities on services to which the Government contributesthrough specific grants or the rate support grant.Administration of JusticeCourt services England and wales. Expenditure by local authorities on magistrates&apos; and other lower courtsaccounts for over half of the total estimates and most of this is for day to day
running costs. The estimates allow for a 30 per cent rise in expenditure over theperiod because of the continuing increase in the volume of work which the courtsare handling. Provision is also made for the replacement of existing buildingstaken over for use as higher courts. The estimates show an increase of some  million a year over the levels of last year&apos;s White Paper. This is mainly becauselast year&apos;s estimates were made before there was enough evidence about the trend in costs awarded in magistrates&apos; and crown courts, for which, following the Courts Act 1971, central government had taken over responsibility from local authorities.3. For the higher courts, provision is made for a centralised building programme to fulfil the recommendation of the Royal Commission under LordBeeching that the Lord Chancellor should be responsible for ensuring that newcourts are built and maintained by the central government wherever needed.The programme over the next five years continues with the aim of reducing the delays in Greater London in bringing cases to trial, and of ensuring that delaysdo not accumulate elsewhere.Court services scotland. Central government assumed responsibility for court house accommoda-tion on 1 April 1973 and with this began the planning of a centralised building programme to replace and modernise existing sheriff court houses. In the period covered by the estimate, expenditure is expected to rise from about  0-5 million to just over  2 million.Other services related to crime5. Payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board are forecast to rise from  4-9 million in 1973-74 to  7-8 million in 1977-78. This forecast isbased on an estimated intake of 12,350 cases in 1973-74 rising to 19,500 by1977-78.Legal aid. The object of the expenditure is to make legal aid, advice and assistanceavailable to persons of limited means. The scope of the schemes is fixed by statute, with the result that the level of expenditure will depend on the numberof qualifying applicants.7. Expenditure is expected to rise steadily over the period, in line with the upward trends in litigation and the general work-load of the courts. The numberof cases in which legal aid is granted is expected to rise by about 2 per cent ayear from about 180,000 cases a year in 1973-74 for civil cases and by about  per cent a year from about 140,000 cases in 1973-74 for criminal cases. the levels of expenditure are affected also by improvements in the capital and incomelimits for the availability of legal aid and legal advice and assistance. It has alsobeen agreed to review the income limits for the two schemes annually.Treatment of offenders8. The Government aims to strengthen the probation and after-care service,develop effective new measures of non-custodial treatment and, for those whohave still to be dealt with in custody, provide modern prisons and improveconditions in the older ones.
Prisons9. The main assumption is that the total number held in prison, whichaveraged 43,400 in 1972-73, will not increase as steeply as had previously beenfeared, but may reach 47,600 by 1977-78. This lower forecast takes account ofrecent trends in the number of people convicted (allowing for variations in age groups and types of crime) and in the sentencing practice of the courts towardsnon-custodial measures.10. The number of non-industrial staff in the prisons is estimated to rise by5,200 in the period. The estimates also provide for an increase in the number of probation officers and supporting staff for welfare duties in prisons in Englandand Wales, and for their introduction into training borstals. It is expected that420 probation officers will be so employed in 1973-74 rising to 540 in 1977-78.This trend is much the same as was planned last year. In Scotland prison welfareduties are now being undertaken by local authority social work departments.11. The Government has reviewed both the content and the timing of the prison capital programme outlined in Cmnd 5178. Provision is now made forwork to start on about 8,700 new places over the 5 year period compared with17,000 then envisaged. Of the programme for producing new places about half is designed to reduce overcrowding as well as to cater for the projected increasein the population. The remainder enables a modest beginning to be made onreplacing obsolete prison accommodation.12. The total building programme assumes the completion of just over11,000 new places within the period compared with the 14,000 envisaged in cmnd 5178. There are at present about 13,500 prisoners sleeping 2 or 3 in acell. This number should be reduced over the period. In particular, the number ofprisoners required to sleep 3 in a cell, which has been reduced from nearly10,000 to 4,000 in the last 3 years should continue to fall.13. It is planned to continue expenditure on works which do not produceplaces, such as improvements to boiler houses, workshops, offices and visitingrooms, at about  6-6 million a year.14. The estimated expenditure also provides for about 4,700 staff quarters,including those built with new establishments. This number should allow for increases in staff and still reduce the current shortage of quarters and allow forsome replacement of obsolete ones.Probation and after-care (England and Wales)15. The principal assumptions are that the number of probation officers will rise from 3,775 to 5,300 over the period and ancillary staff from 240 (210 in cmnd 5178) to 400. The estimates provide also for an increase of 1,800 places inadult hostels and bail hostels; for the setting up by 1976-77 of 78 community service schemes and day training centres under the control of probation andafter-care committees after the initial experimental introduction of these services; and for the continued provision of about 200 additional places eachyear in voluntary after-care hostels.
16. The estimates for training probation students (including prison welfare officers) assume an output of 600 trained students in 1974 and 745 in 1975 and subsequent years. For the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 provision has been madefor the increased costs attributable to a switch in emphasis from one-year to two-year training courses for non-graduate students.General Protective ServicesPolice17. The programme provides for continued development of a well-mannedand operationally efficient police force by further recruitment, provision of supporting services and improvement of technical facilities, equipment and buildings. The estimates assume as the probable rate of recruitment based on recent trends an increase in police strength from 111,500 to approximately123,400 compared with a growth of 9,870 over the previous five years. The pro-jected increase of 11,900 in five years, compared with nearly 19,000 in last year&apos;white Paper, in no way implies that recruitment will be restricted or that lowerpriority will be given to building up police strength. If recruitment shouldlater improve or wastage be reduced, the estimates would be revised and pro-vision would be made for additional expenditure.18. In the period to 1977-78 the number of civilians is expected to increase from 44,000 to approximately 54,800, including provision for an additional5,200 traffic wardens. This too is a somewhat slower increase than was previously envisaged, but is as high as experience now suggests can be realistically expected.19. The estimates provide for increases in capital expenditure on the pur-chase of sites and the construction of operational buildings. These have beenoffset by a reduction in previously forecast expenditure on new dwellings becauseof the increasing tendency for police officers to purchase their own houses.Provision has also been made for replacing buildings for some forensic sciencelaboratories and police district training centres, and for expansion of the PoliceCollege. Continued provision is made for the Police National Computer.20. The estimates of current expenditure provide for an expansion of theprogramme of research into police methods, equipment and communications;equipment for the forensic science laboratories and police district trainingcentres; and the implementation of changes in the police and fire wireless schemesresulting from the reorganisation of local government boundaries.Fire services21. The estimates assume an increase in the number of whole-time firemenfrom 29,200 to 30,400 and civilian staff from 4,700 to 5,500. These assumptions,those for the number of retained (part-time) and junior firemen and those forthe calls on manpower of improved training are unchanged from the last white paper. The estimates do not take into account the possible effects on fire service manpower of the recent agreement on fire service pay and hours.22. Since the last White Paper was published it has been decided not toproceed with a central recruit training establishment, with resulting savings ofabout  0-7 million in current expenditure for 1975-76 and 1976-77. Capitalprovision will not be affected, since corresponding sums will be needed by localauthorities for improving local facilities for training recruits.
23. Allowance has been included for the effects of the Fire Precautions(Loans) Act 1973, under which small hotels and boarding houses may borrowfrom local authorities to pay for improvements necessitated by the Fire Pre-cautions Act 1971. The estimates (which at this stage are tentative), excludinginterest charges and assuming a ten year loan period, rise from  1-0 million in1973-74 to a peak of  1-8 million in 1975-76 and fall to  0-9 million by 1977-78.Other24. Control of immigration, the Immigration Appeals Tribunal and agrant-in-aid to the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service togetheraccount for practically the whole of this expenditure.Community Services25. The estimates show an increase of nearly 20 per cent over the period.The main factor in the increase is expenditure on the Urban Programme. Ex-cluding  2-1 million falling mainly in 1973-74 on account of delayed completionof capital expenditure on the regional infrastructure, this expenditure is expectedto rise from  14-4 million in 1973-74 to  20-8 million in 1977-78. This represents an increase of about  2 million a year from 1974-75 onwards compared withthe estimate in Cmnd 5178 and reflects the Governments policy of providing additional help to areas of urban deprivation.26. The rest of the provision is mainly for grants by the Home and CivilService Departments to statutory and voluntary bodies. These grants include 2.8 million in 1973-74 and  0.3 million in 1974-75 for the completion of thework of the Uganda Resettlement Board. The Lord Privy Seal has now assumed responsibility for co-ordinating the Governments efforts to support and en-courage voluntary work and a Voluntary Services Unit has been established inthe Civil Service Department to assist him. Grants will be made to voluntary organisations within a total annual budget of  1-9 million for projects spanningthe interests of several departments or falling outside the field of responsibilityof any one department.OTHER INFORMATION27. The following table provides a simple framework within which theallocation of resources to the prison service might be related to the planned useof these resources and their projected outputs. Other information of a non-financial character may be derived from the annual reports on the work of the prison Services, reports on the work of the Probation and After-care Serviceand from the annual reports of HM Chief Inspectors of the Police and fire services.

Explanatory noteThere are a number of reasons why some overcrowding is likely to persisteven though the total number of places available in the system is roughly equalto the predicted population.In establishments which have to accept people committed to custody, ielocal prisons and remand centres, a proportion of the available places must bekept in reserve to accommodate fluctuating and unpredictable numbers remandedby the courts. Experience suggests that in such establishments a margin of places of at least 5 per cent in excess of uncrowded capacity is desirable.In training establishments the increasing specialisation of penal treatmentmeans that there is less opportunity to transfer inmates from one type of establishment to another. For example, vacancies in open prisons cannot be filled by prisoners who are unsuitable for open conditions. Nor is it generallypossible to transfer young offenders particularly those under 17 to other types of training establishments which may have vacancies.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE28. The main policy changes since Cmnd 5178 are the reductions made as aresult of the general measures announced by the Government on 21 May 1973and 8 October 1973, together with the addition of provision for fire precautionsloans, and the increase in the Urban Programme and in the grants for voluntary service.29. The main estimating changes are that provision is made for the slower rate of increase in police strengths that is now expected, and a smaller prisonbuilding programme is now put forward.

Education and librariesGeneral1. Table 2.10 above shows that expenditure on education and libraries inGreat Britain is expected to rise by  601 million in the period 1973-74 to1977-78. By 1977-78 the programme is expected to account for [ ] per cent of all public expenditure.2. The programme provides for continued development of the strategyannounced in Cmnd 5174 for England and Wales and Cmnd 5175 for Scotland,including the development of nursery education, the improvement and replace-ment of school buildings, the acceleration of the special schools building pro-gramme, improvements in the arrangements for in-service training of teachers and the continued expansion of higher education.3. A rephasing of public sector building programmes was announced on8 October 1973. Education building projects in the 1973-74 starts programmes which had not secured approval by that date were deferred until after 31December 1973; [arrangements for resumption of the education building pro-gramme have now been announced]. This three months&apos; deferment will not affectthe achievement of the long term plans mentioned in the preceding paragraph.4. The current expenditure forecasts shown in the table above for 1974-75reflect the Governmenfs decisions, for the purposes of Rate Support Grant, onacceptable levels of local authority relevant expenditure in England and Walesduring that year.* Discussions with Scottish local authorities about the level ofreckonable expenditure for 1974-75 are continuing. The forecasts for subsequent years take account of the Governmenfs declared intention to restrain the growth of local authority expenditure.5. Demographic factors continue to play a major role in the growth of educational expenditure within current policies. Forecasts of the numbers of pupils, students and teachers underlying the expenditure projections shown above are as follows:Thousands	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78Schools (&apos;)					Under fives (2)	393	440	480	520	561primary pupils	5,512	5,465	5,385	5,303	5,179secondary pupils	4,113	4,253	4,397	4,520	4,606Teachers (under fives,					primary and secondary)	480	498	517	534	546Further Education					Students (?)	775	807	849	892	944Colleges of Education					Students (4)	129	127	129	121	112Universities					Full-time students	252	264	283	306	326(i) Estimates for January in the relevant year.(2)The figures, which include nursery school pupils, are estimates for January in the relevant year and take account of the proportionate demand on facilities of part-time pupilsand are expressed as full-time equivalents.* [See Cmnd 0000]
Schools6. The number of children under five (as opposed to full-time equivalentsshown in the table in paragraph 5) attending nursery or primary schools, whetherpart-time or full-time, in 1972-73 was 391,900 and is expected to rise to 754,000by 1977-78. A fall in the number of other primary school pupils within the review period is more than offset by a rise in the secondary school population.The primary and secondary school building programmes take account of these changes, and include also programmes for the expansion of nursery education and for the improOement and reSlacement of old and unsatisfactory schoobuildings.7. Provision is made for increasing the number of teachers in nursery,primary and secondary schools in England and Wales towards the planningfigure for 1981 of 510,000 announced in Cmnd 5174. Over the same period thenumber of teachers in Scottish schools is expected to rise to some 55,000.8. The forecasts include expenditure on the school health service which willbecome largely the responsibility of area authorities from 1 April 1974 when that expenditure, mainly current, will transfer to the Health programmes.9. The estimates for 1973-74 and 1974-75 take account of the Govern-menfs decision to defer the previously intended increases in the school mealcharge and to hold it down to the 1971 level for the present. Thereafter thefigures reflect periodic increases in the charge for school meals from 1975onwards aimed at preventing a further increase in the proportion of costs borneby subsidy.Higher andfurther education10. The forecasts of expenditure on higher and further education are basedon the student numbers set out in the table in paragraph 5 above, which allow for an increasing number of colleges of education in England and Wales offeringcourses other than those designed specifically for intending teachers. The fore-casts also take account of the proposals in Cmnd 5174 and Cmnd 5175 for theexpansion of in-service training courses for teachers, and in the former ofinduction training courses also. For further education the forecasts assume arising student population and allow for the expansion of residential accommo-dation for students in polytechnics and in comparable colleges in Scotland. the forecast of student numbers in universities and the related expenditure are basedon the quinquennial settlement for 1972-1977. As a contribution towards economy in public expenditure the Government has decided to withhold half the supple-mentation of recurrent grant, and not to supplement equipment grant, in respectof one year&apos;s increase in prices for the academic year 1974-75 and subsequent years of the quinquennium. It believes that these reductions could be accommo-dated without detriment to the planned growth of the universities during this(3) The figures which, are estimated for the academic year commencing in the relevantfinancial year, take account of the proportionate demands on facilities of full-time, part-timeand evening students and are expressed as full-time equivalents. The figures include estimates of students expected to be following courses, other than teacher training, in colleges of educa-tion.(4) Estimates for the academic year commencing in the relevant financial year. Includesstudents (together with the full-time equivalents of part-time students) following courses ofin-service training and induction training as well as courses of initial teacher training
period. These decisions produce a reduction in forecasts of university expendi-ture of  6 million in 1974-75 rising to  10 million in 1977-78.Other programmes11. The recurrent expenditure forecasts provide for the continuing develop-ment of the youth service and of local libraries and museums. The control ofcapital expenditure on these services in England and Wales rests with the localauthorities since they are included within the locally determined sector of localauthority capital programmes. In Scotland there is central control of capitalexpenditure on the youth and community service, and of the library service inmost areas.Research Councils, etc.12. The entry for the Research Councils, etc, represents expenditure collec-tively known as the Science Budget, for which the Secretary of State for Educa-tion and Science is responsible. It relates to expenditure by the five research councils (Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment, Science, and SocialScience) and a grant-in-aid to the Royal Society for scientific purposes. TheSecretary of State is advised on its allocation by the Advisory Board for the research Councils. Expenditure on Scientific and Technical Documentation,currently met from the Science Budget will, from 1 April 1974, become theresponsibility of the British Library.13. The figures for the years from 1973-74 onwards reflect the Governmentsdecisions, announced in &quot;Framework for Government Research and Develop-ment&quot; (Cmnd 5046), to transfer certain sums from the Science Budget to cus-tomer Departments for the purpose of commissioning applied research.14. The purpose of the research financed from the Science Budget is todevelop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from investigation of human and animal health and behaviour through the causes of, and cures for pollution, to the mapping of earth, sea and sky and the investigation of the laws of physical matter.15. The distribution of expenditure between different types of activity variesfrom one Research Council to another, as Table A illustrates. A major activityfor some Councils is the provision of post-graduate awards in the scientific fields,and Table B shows the number of awards made during the past five years.16. A major part of the expenditure of the Agricultural, Medical and natural Environment Research Councils is incurred on the maintenance of research establishments and units to provide a fundamental research capability,to meet the needs of customer Departments for applied research, and to advance the standard of scientific excellence in specific fields. In the case of the science and Social Science Research Councils, a larger proportion of their budget isexpended on support for universities. The Science Research Council&apos;s expendi-ture on research establishments, including expenditure on international researchcentres such as CERN, provides central facilities for the use of university researchworkers, especially in fields, such as nuclear physics and astronomy, which call for heavy expenditure on plant and equipment.

Attendance figures at the national museums and galleries included inthe Arts programme over the last four years were as follows:The capital expenditure shown for the national museums and galleries is therevalued estimate of the cost shown in Cmnd 5178, reduced by  1-4 millionthrough the deferments of Capital projects announced in May and October 1973.Some redistribution of the expenditure between the various years has been necessary because, in a small programme dominated by two or three major projects, an even flow of expenditure may not be possible. The Governmentsincreased contribution of  0-3 million under the National Theatre and Museumof London Act 1973 towards the furnishing and equipping of the building forthe Museum of London is now spread over the years 1974-75 and 1975-76.18. Following the decision that the national institutions will be allowed toretain the proceeds from admission charges the provisions for current expendi-ture have been increased by  1-0 million a year from 1974-75.Arts Council and other arts19. Continuing provision for growth in current expenditure for the arts council was supplemented in 1973-74 with a special allocation of  0-7 million from the  1-0 million provided for the encouragement of the arts in the regionsoutside London with particular reference to the assisted areas. On the same basisa sum of  0-1 million was added to the grant to the British Film Institute. Similarallocations may be made in 1974-75.20. The British Film Institute continues to maintain the National FilmArchive and increasingly to make the films held there available for study. Itcontinues to encourage the appreciation of film as an art form by supporting thedevelopment of film theatres, often in collaboration with the Regional ArtsAssociations and in association with the Arts Council. The National Film Schoolis now in its third full academic year with student numbers approaching the leveloriginally envisaged; grant provision has increased correspondingly. Provisionof  0-2 million a year is made for the Crafts as from 1972-73.21. Capital provision for the Arts Council of Great Britain and the BritishFilm Institute is made in respect of the continuing programmes for Housing the arts and Housing the Cinema. In 1973-74 increased annual commitments were authorised for the period of the Survey.22. Since the inception of the Housing the Arts scheme 187 projects have&apos; received or been promised support. The total cost of all the projects (actual and estimated) is  30-3 million of which the Arts Council contribution is  5-2 million.Of those projects, 54 were concerned with improving existing and building newtheatres, involving a total of 35,000 seats at a cost of  14-8 million, to which the arts Council contributed  2-9 million.millions19691970.1971197212-513-814-313-5
23. Provision of  1-0 million (Government) and  0-1 million (greater london Council) has been included for the National Theatre for 1974-75. TheGovernments contribution is limited to  5-7 million by the National Theatreand Museum of London Act 1973, and is spread over the period 1968-69 to1975-76.24. Provision is included for the purchase of land for the possible extension,at some time in the future, of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden ( 6-million in 1973-74, none in other years), for certain aspects, including the OperaHouse element, of the Castle Terrace Theatre Development in Edinburgh,towards which a Government contribution is proposed, and a grant in 1973-74of  0-1 million towards the restoration of the Royal Albert Hall.25. Expenditure by local authorities on arts centres, local theatres and artsactivities other than museums is included under improvement of the environment and other facilities in Table 2.8 Other environmental services.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE26. The changes in expenditure for policy reasons shown at the foot of table 2.10 above mainly reflect the prospective rise in the school meals charge,and the consequence for education of the measures announced by Governmenton 21 May and 8 October 1973. The announcement of 21 May, which set outmeasures for restraining the growth of public expenditure in 11974-75, included a reduction in local authority current expenditure for that year of  81 million.The forecast of current expenditure for England and Wales for 1974-75 reflects the share of that reduction attributable to education, while consequentialreductions have been carried forward into subsequent years. The rephasing ofeducation building programmes, in accordance with the announcement of8 October (see paragraph 3 above), has led to some reduction in the capitalexpenditure forecasts for 1973-74 and the two following years.27. The estimating changes reflect revised forecasts of a lower rate of growth of pupil and students numbers, offset by the effects of an excess in the actuallevel of expenditure by local education authorities in England and Wales in1972-73 compared with the previous forecast.

Health and personal social services. 1. Various minor changes have been made in the scope of the programmesince Cmnd 5178. These include the transfer to the Education and Librariesprogramme of responsibility for supporting certain categories of studentstraining for social work; and the incorporation into this programme of certainhealth treatment expenditures arising from entry into the e.c., and of the costof concessionary fares schemes for the elderly and disabled introduced by localauthorities, previously counted as Miscellaneous Local Services.2. The aim of the programme is to provide, within the resources available,a full range of health and personal social services for all those in need of them.In pursuit of this aim the National Health Service is to be reorganised from1 April 1974 so as to draw together the hospitals, family practitioner servicesand local authority health services under a unified administration. This re-organisation is intended to lead to better deployment of scarce resources(particularly of highly skilled manpower) and to co-ordinated planning of the many different aspects of prevention, treatment, care and rehabilitation. the basic objectives will continue to be to meet health or social needs wherever andwhenever they arise; to eradicate inequalities in the services available in different areas; to develop and use new medical and allied techniques and generally toimprove and widen the range of services available. All these objectives must beset against the background not only of an increasing population (about 0-2 percent increase each year) but also an ageing one (the proportion of those overretirement age is increasing at 0-9 per cent a year and the over 75&apos;s at 2-2 percent a year).3. The table reflects the new administrative arrangements. The heading&quot;Family Practitioners&quot; now covers only the contractual payments to doctors,dentists, pharmacists and opticians. &quot;Other health services&quot; embraces suchelements as the Dental Estimates Board, Joint Pricing Committees, training,and laboratory and vaccine services. Expenditure on personal social services by central government relates to various grants in respect of the child care and community services; in England and Wales to youth treatment centres run bythe Department of Health and Social Security for children not amenable to care in a community home and in Scotland to List D schools, the costs of which areshared with the local authorities.4. The planned average annual growth rate of expenditure in real termsover the period 1972-73 to 1977-78 is 3-5 per cent, excluding the relative price effect. Within this period, the forecasts for the three years to 1975-76 includethe special additions made by the Government in 1970 and 1971 to improveservices for the elderly, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.HealthHospitals and community services. The special additions to the capital forecasts referred to in paragraph 4come to an end in 1975-76. The forecasts for the following two years are there-fore correspondingly less. The principal objective of the hospital capital pro-gramme is to provide a network of district general hospitals which will offercomprehensive services for populations up to about 250,000 people. It isexpected that some 300 such hospitals will be built; about 190 are under con-
struction. In some cases the hospitals will be completely new but for the majoritythere will be a programme of modernisation and extension of existing premises,Alongside this essentially long term programme, there will be other projectssuch as the replacement of accommodation that has become uneconomical to staff or to keep in good repair; the provision of facilities to meet newlyremerginghealth needs eg alcoholism and the construction or adaptation of buildings toenable new patterns of health -care to be introduced eg day hospitals or daywards within ordinary hospitals where minor operations can be undertaken with the minimum of inconvenience to patients and at the same time with greater efficiency and economy in the use of hospital resources. It is also proposed ithat community hospitals in England and Wales will be associated, where appropriate, with general hospitals as units in the district hospital service andclosely linked with the primary health services.6. Current expenditure on hospital and community services is planned toincrease in real terms during the period of the programme at much the same rate as in the past. An increase of about half to one per cent each year.is needed to provide services for the growing and ageing population. Further sums will beused to meet the additional running costs of new or modernised hospitals andthe remainder of the development addition, together with savings arising from increased efficiency, will be devoted to other improvements to raise standards ofhealth care for all patients, but particularly for the mentally ill, mentally handicapped and the elderly. The development of new methqds of treatment and patterns of care will be encouraged and there will be a new emphasis onbetter co-ordination and training which, in its turn, should&apos;benefit everyonewho needs health services. It is expected that the current rising trend in thenumber of in-patients treated will continue (over the period 1962.to 1972 thenumber of in-patients treated per one thousand population rose from 96-0 to115-7 an increase of over 20 per cent)., It is also expected that there will be moreprogress in reducing the size of the waiting list. Further information of a non-financial nature may be found in the annual publication &quot;Health and social services Statistics for England and Wales&quot; in the annual reports, of the Depart-ment of Health and Social Security and its Chief Medical Officer, and in &quot;health services in Scotland&quot;.Family practitioners7. The services under this heading, the General Medical,. Dental and ophthalmic Services, and the Pharmaceutical Service, provide primary care forthe population as a whole. Provision has been made for increased calls upon theservices, including conservative dental treatment for young people, sight-testingand the dispensing of newly-developed medicines. If&apos; is expected that there willbe continued growth in the number of doctors and dentists in general practice which will be larger than the corresponding population growth, thus providing an improved service. More efficient and effective working methods will be encouraged by continued assistance to build or modernise surgeries, help in meeting the costs of ancillary staff and incentives to work in groups and partner-ships. Another significant contribution will be made by the greatly increasednumbers of health centres in which doctors, dentists and other members of the primary health care team can provide a comprehensive service to the community.By the end of the year it is expected that there will be over 500 such centres in
operation (compared with 100 at the end of 1968). The reorganisation of the health Service will open up new opportunities for family practitioners todevelop their services as an integral part of the overall health care plan for theirlocality.Personal social services. Capital expenditure by local authorities is largely devoted to the pro-vision of additional or replacement residential accommodation or day facilitiesfor the elderly, the physically or mentally handicapped, the mentally ill andchildren in care, and to the improvement of existing facilities. In asking localauthorities in England and Wales in 1972 to prepare 10-year development plans for their social services the Department of Health and Social Security offerednational guidelines for the provision of residential and day places, which, al-lowing for replacement of the more unsatisfactory out-of-date and unsuitablepremises, envisaged the provision of a total of about 250,000 residential andday places. The cost of providing residential and day facilities may vary con-siderably according to local circumstances, but the expenditure forecast forthe 5. years 1973-74 to 1977-78 should enable some 50,000 residential and50,000 day places to be provided. It is expected that about 5,000 residential and5,000 day places will be provided in Scotland over the same period.9. Capital expenditure normally entails increased revenue expenditure,either to meet the running costs of additional facilities (eg new homes or ex-tensions to existing premises) or the extra running cost of providing a betterservice for the same number of people in modernised accommodation. It isestimated that the amount of the additional revenue expenditure thus generatedeach year is about a fifth of the capital investment (about  80 million). Theaverage annual increase in revenue expenditure is expected to be about  32million. About half will therefore be taken up by the consequences of capitalexpenditure and half by expansion and improvement of fieldwork, domiciliary,preventive and support services, and research and development.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE10. Policy changes since last year&apos;s White Paper include the decision to expand the family planning services at a faster rate than previously envisaged by making them available through the Family Practitioner Service, with advice from general practitioners free of charge and supplies on prescription obtainablefrom chemists under the standard National Health Service charging arrang-ments. The resultant expenditure is expected to rise to a peak of about  30million in 1976-77. The programme is also affected by the measures taken by theGovernment in October to deal, with the problem of overloading in the con-struction industry and by the slowing down of the growth in public expenditurereferred to in Part 1; the resulting adjustments to the forecasts for NHS hospital and local authority building projects in last year&apos;s White Paper, revalued, are:NHS HospitalsLocal authority building1973-74-8-1-1-51974-75-12.7-5-31975-76-9.5-4.5  million1976-77-7.7-3.3
The average annual growth rate forecast for current expenditure on the personal social services over the period covered by Cmnd 5178, 1971-72 to1976-77, was 8-5 per cent. The provisional outturn for 1972-73 and the latest estimate for 1973.-74 indicate that expenditure is likely to have substantiallyexceeded the forecasts, so that, in order to keep to the planned course of 8-5 percent average annual growth, a rather slower rate is necessary for the next fewyears. The forecasts reflect this aim, and produce an average annual growth ratebetween 1972-73 and 1977-78 of about 7 per cent.11. Estimating changes have arisen mainly as a result of a re-appraisalof likely expenditure on the family practitioner services, including an increasein the number of prescriptions expected to be dispensed and in the proportion of dental treatments provided without charge.

The general pattern of expenditure as between the various social security benefits is unchanged from Cmnd 5178. Retirement pensions are the largestsingle item and account for about half the expenditure. Other contributory benefits account for between a fifth and a quarter, and the balance is made upby the non-contributory benefits (principally supplementary benefit, family allowances, war pensions and attendance allowance) and administration and miscellaneous services (which account for approximately 4 per cent of thetotal).2. Table 2.12 above follows the established convention that social securityfigures do not reflect changes which may be made in the future but which havenot yet been announced, since a decision about, for example, the amount ofan increase in benefits need not be made too far in advance of the date from which

The pattern of annual upratings is now established and, as regards themain insurance benefits, attendance allowance and old persons&apos; pensions, it is put in statutory form in the Social Security Act 1973. Allowance is made under&quot;Price adjustments&quot; or &quot;Adjustments to 1973-74 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; in the tables in Parts 1 and 3 of this White Paper to take accountof the extent to which benefits lose their value as prices rise and have thatvalue restored each Autumn.

From September 1971 invalidity benefit replaced sickness benefit for those sick for more than6 months. The 1971-72 figure for sickness and injury benefits reflects the position before thechange.(2) Numbers of qualifying children (ie children after the first in the family).Numbers of Beneficiaries4. The table above shows the estimated average numbers receiving the mainbenefits, on which the expenditure figures in Table 2.12 are based. The estimates for future years are more uncertain for some benefits than for others. In general,the numbers receiving the long-term benefits are more stable and less subject tosudden change than the numbers receiving the short-term benefits. For example,the numbers of those with a retirement pension, widow&apos;s benefit or war pensioncan be predicted with fair accuracy. The estimates for sickness benefit, on theother hand, are less firm. A degree of speculation necessarily enters into the assumptions made about the future general trend of sickness (see paragraph below); and the incidence of epidemics will result in considerable fluctuations.;in the numbers of beneficiaries from year to year. The figures for unemploymentsbenefit reflect a working assumption, not a forecast, about the future levels ofunemployment.5. The estimating of future numbers on supplementary benefit is especiallydifficult. Because the supplementary benefit scheme brings people&apos;s income up toa standard level, the factors which affect individual entitlement and the amountof benefit payable are extremely diverse and, particularly for those belowpension age, the subject of constant change. The estimates of those on sup-supplementary benefit are therefore more tentative than the estimates for the cor-responding insurance benefits.6. The estimated numbers of retirement pensioners given in the tablereflect the continuing increase in the number of people over pensionable age.It is assumed that the well-established trend towards earlier retirement will

The small expected decline in the numbers of widow beneficiariesreflects an assumption of falling mortality. The numbers of war pensions con-tinue to fall as the two world wars become more distant. The numbers for attend-ance allowance reflect the phased introduction of the lower-rate allowance during1973-74.7. As regards sickness there was an upward trend in claims during most ofthe 1960s, but in the last few years the rates of claim have been somewhat lower than the peak reached in 1969-70. Over recent months, however, claims havebeen running at a higher level and allowance has been made for some further increase in the future in the rates of claim for both sickness benefit and invaliditybenefit. On the other hand this effect is partly offset by the effect of expectedchanges in the composition of the insured population which, on the assumption of constant claim rates, would have resulted in a slight downward trend in thenumbers of beneficiaries.8. The proportion of the unemployed who are entitled to unemploymentbenefit is not constant since it is affected by the level and general trend ofunemployment. The increase in the numbers for unemployment benefit in1975-76 and 1976-77 must not therefore be taken as implying an assumptionthat unemployment will be rising in those years. It simply reflects an assumptionthat the proportion of the unemployed who have run out of unemploymentbenefit, which is at present unusually high because of the recent sharp fall in umemployment, will fall as unemployment settles to its assumed steady level.
The Tax Credit scheme. Although the Government has accepted the report of the Select Com-mittee on Tax-Credit and has announced its intention to legislate to give effectto the tax credit scheme, the precise timing of its introduction and the levels of credit have still to be settled. It is not yet possible therefore to take the scheme into account in the projections of social security expenditure, and the tablesabove do not reflect the important effects to be expected from the scheme in reducing the numbers relying on supplementary benefit and family income supplement.CHANGES IN EXPENDITUREIncreases and Improvements10. The 1973 uprating envisaged in Cmnd 5178 as being in the second halfof November was brought forward to the beginning of October. On this occasion the long-term benefits were increased by more than the short-term benefits:for example, the standard single rate of retirement pension went up from  6-75to  7-75, while the standard single rate of unemployment and sickness benefitwent up from  6-75 to  7-35. For the pension and other long-term benefits theincrease provided a real improvement of about 4  per cent in purchasing power.11. There have been a number of other additions to expenditure since cmnd 5178.(i) The qualifying income levels for family income supplement were increased in April 1973 and October 1973. The maximum amount ofbenefit for the larger family was also increased in October 1973. these changes add  2 million a year to expenditure.(ii) The amounts awarded by the Supplementary Benefits Commission for exceptional heating expenses are now paid on top of supplementary benefit instead of being offset against a part of it. This improvement,which took effect in October 1973, adds  6 million to expenditure in afull year.(iii) The dates of the introduction of attendance [allowance at the lower ratefor the remaining groups of beneficiaries have been brought forward.For children the allowance began to be paid from October 1973 insteadof, as originally envisaged, December 1973; and for the elderly, from december 1973 instead of June or December 1974. This adds  5 million to expenditure in 1973-74,  10 million in 1974-75 and  3 million in1975-76.(iv) Special lump-sum payments of  10 were made at the end of November1973 to retirement pensioners and others over minimum pension agewith comparable benefits. This adds  80 million to expenditure in1973-74.12. In the comparison in Table 2.12 of the new totals of expenditure withthe figures in Cmnd 5178, the entry for other policy changes includes the costof bringing forward the 1973 uprating from November to October, the cost ofthe real improvement in the value of benefits and the additions to expenditurenoted in the previous paragraph.
Estimating Changes13. The estimating changes in comparison with Cmnd 5178 derive fromchanged assumptions about the numbers of beneficiaries in the light of the latest information. As regards attendance allowance the previous estimate of thenumbers qualifying for the higher rate has proved too low; but the estimate forthe lower rate looks too high on the present pattern of claims and has therefore been reduced.

Over half of the total is for the Revenue Departments with smaller sumsfor the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health and social security and local authorities. The administration of VAT has required the build-up of an extra 6,000 staff. An increase will be needed in Inland Revenuestaff for the restructured national insurance scheme and for other areas of growth,offset to some extent by the run-down of surtax staff following the introductionof the unified system of personal taxation. Other savings will result from theabolition of SET.Other financial administration2. The net costs of the Department for National Savings amount to over 20 million a year. Also included are the Treasury, the Royal Mint, and certaincosts incurred by the Bank of England including the note issue work on themanagement of the national debt and the Bank of England&apos;s capital expenditure.Records, registrations and surveys3.

Provision is made under the Office of population censuses and Surveys for the social surveys carried out as an allied service forGovernment Departments.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)4. Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the British broadcasting corporation (Home Services) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority.The Corporation and the Authority are co-ordinating separately financedprogrammes for the construction of UHF stations to transmit BBC and IBAtelevision services on 625 lines (black and white and colour). The aim is toincrease the present coverage of almost 93 per cent, attained by the UHFstations to about 96 per cent, by 1977-78. The Corporation^ expenditure (capital and current) is financed by Government grant which at present consists of thewhole of the net licence revenue. The Authority provides transmitters to broad-cast the programmes of independent television and independent local radiocompanies and is financed by the rentals charged to the companies. The Inde-pendent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 also provides for the IBA to draw upto  2 million on loan for financing the independent local radio services: thefirst two stations commenced operations in October 1973.ids
Other services. The largest single item is the net lending and overseas investment ofCable and Wireless Ltd. amounting to  74 million over the period 1973-74 to1977-78. The company is Government owned and operates solely overseas. it provides international communication and internal telephone systems in anumber of overseas countries and provides an important link in the Common-wealth telecommunications network.6. The remainder includes expenditure by the Cabinet Office, the public trustee, salaries and administration costs of the Ministry of Posts and Tele-communications, and Civil List annuities and pensions. The figures includereceipts of  7 million, accruing mainly in 1973-74, from the sale of assets of theState Management Districts of Carlisle, Gretna and Cromarty Firth.CHANGES IN expenditure.   On broadcasting, changes since Cmnd 5178 revalued are due to therephasing of estimated expenditure. These reflect a faster rate in extending theBCs UHF coverage to reach 98 per cent by 1980; and a reduction in estimated expenditure by the IBA on VHF television.

This programme includes all expenditure on the provision of office buildings and on the furnishing and running costs of specialised buildings forthe Home Civil Service.2. Capital expenditure relates mainly to the building and furnishing of newoffice buildings, and covers programmes for constructing local offices of Govern-ment Departments and headquarters buildings in London and the regions.3. Expenditure on rents reflects the fact that approximately 58 per cent of office accommodation is provided in leased buildings. The forecasts allow forthe fact that new hirings will normally be taken at higher rents than the aver-age rent paid on existing hirings which is still substantially below current market value. The figures used reflect the effect of the Business Rents Orders on rents;however whilst this has reduced the level of expenditure on rents in money terms it does not affect the forecasts at constant prices. Some of the new CrownBuildings will reduce dependence on the leased accommodation but many ofthe major schemes will not be completed within the survey period and their effect is thus not reflected in the rental figures.Stationery and printing (home)4. HM Stationery Office supplies Government departments with theirprinting, stationery and office machinery, and is responsible for the printing andin most cases the publication, distribution and sale of Government publicationson which the annual turnover is some  6 million. It also supplies some other public sector bodies.

The role of the Central Computer Agency is to promote the applicationof computer systems in Government with the aim of improving administrativeefficiency and widening policy choices. It advises Departments on systems; onthe capabilities of hardware and software and associated equipment; on facilities available^within Government and outside; and on project and installation man-encouragement . It is responsible for control of expenditure on computer hardware andsoftware. It also provides centralised purchasing and services. With effect from 1January 1973 the Agency assumed responsibility for the formulation of policy on and financial control of telecommunications used in Government for adminis-trative purposes.Home publicity services. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carried out bythe Central Office of Information for other Government departments, and whichare directed principally at audiences in the United Kingdom through the mediaof press and television advertising, films and exhibitions. Related printing costsby HM Stationery Office are included. The major continuing campaignsallowed for are Armed Forces recruitment and road safety.Civil superannuation7. The main extra costs expected to arise from the introduction in June 1972of a new Civil Service pension scheme were taken into account in last year&apos;white Paper.
CHANGES IN expenditure. On accommodation services, apart from the effect of the rephasing ofpublic buildings contracts announced by the Prime Minister on 8 October, therehave been no major changes since Cmnd 5178 in the provisions for new building.Maintenance and other runnings costs show a reduction, due in part to economy measures. Departmental Administration figures are closely related to the planning of new works and reflect changes in forecast capital expenditure.10. Stationery and printing is expected to cost less, home publicity more.Experience over the last year suggests that there will be a larger than expected increase in the number of new superannuation awards and in the size of theseawards. The present estimates take account of the resulting additional extracosts.8. This programme covers the costs of legal services, the government actuary, Civil Service Catering Services and Transport Services, eg the Govern-ment Car Service, Interdepartmental Despatch Service, transport and removalof furniture, etc.

Table 2.15 has been compiled from estimates which are prepared by theNorthern Ireland Departments and it sets out the expenditure for which these departments are at present responsible. This table does not represent the full extent of public expenditure in Northern Ireland. See paragraphs 3 and 4 below.2. The Northern Ireland Temporary Provisions Act, 1972, remains in force until implementation of Part II of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act, 1973.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, therefore continues, for the timebeing, to be directly responsible for the expenditure of Northern IrelandDepartments. Upon devolution accountability for that part of public expenditure-ure that arises on services transferred to Northern Ireland will be to the NorthernIreland Assembly. The United Kingdom will, however, retain direct responsibility-responsibility for the services specified in the NI Constitution Act 1973 as &quot;expected&quot;and &quot;reserved&quot; and direct Parliamentary accountability for expenditure on such services will continue to be to Westminster. The major expenditures for whichresponsibility will remain with the United Kingdom Government will be onLaw and Order. The arrangements envisaged for the control of expenditure on services devolved were indicated in paragraphs 86-89 of Cmnd 5259.3. The greater part of expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland ismade by the United Kingdom Government through the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and is not, therefore, shown here but included in Table 2.3of this White Paper. This embraces expenditure on price guarantees, both onCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) products and also on products to whichthe CAP does not apply, and on the cost of market support operations to implement the CAP in the United Kingdom. Most production grants and subsidies also apply to Northern Ireland. Expenditure by the UK Governmentin Northern Ireland is estimated to be about  30 million for 1973-74.

The outturn figures for the years 1971-92 and 1972-73 reflect the in-fluence that the disturbances in Northern Ireland have had on public expenditure.Thus the figures for Trade, Industry and employment and for Housing are bothlower than originally estimated. In the first case this reflects a reduction in thenumber of jobs created with public assistance and in the second the limitationsplaced on public sector house building by such factors as the re-deployment oflabour to maintenance and repair of bomb damaged property, the difficulties of house building in areas of considerable unrest and the reluctance shown by thepublic to move to new towns where much public sector housing construc-tion is planned. Law and order by contrast, has shown a major increase in ex-penditure in large part due to compensation payments to individuals andbusinesses for damage to property and personal injury.6. The disturbances have had a similar effect on the estimates of public expenditure over the next five years and estimates for public sector house con-struction, road building and job creation have all been revised downwards in thelight of past outturn. The following tables illustrate this:

The disturbances have had a similar effect on the estimates of public expenditure over the next five years and estimates for public sector house con-struction, road building and job creation have all been revised downwards in thelight of past outturn. The following tables illustrate this:

Even larger changes occur on Law and Order, again reflecting the dis-turbances. As for the outturn years the major element in this increase is theprovision for compensation for criminal damage and personal injury which hasbeen increased by  18 million in 1973-74 and by lesser sums over the remainder of the survey period. It is, of course, not possible to gauge how quickly con-ditions will return to normality following the agreement by the three political partiesto join in a power sharing Executive. But it has been assumed for this Survey thatthe need for compensation payments will reduce gradually rather than continue at their present level or terminate abruptly. The estimates also reflect increases in police manpower and overtime and in capital expenditure on prisons andremand homes.8. Policy changes since Cmnd 5178 in the Trade, industry and employmentprogramme included a decision to provide government assistance to Short-Brothers for the further development of the Skyvan amounting to  0-5 million in 1973-74 rising to  2-5 million in 1975-76. An extension of the Urban and rural Improvement Scheme was also agreed. Northern Ireland Finance Cor-poration, however, is not now expected to distribute more than  16 million over its initial three-year life span.9. Alterations to the Fuel programme are largely the result of a decisionto re-phase expenditure on power stations. This has led to additional expendi-ture of  4-7 million in 1973-74 and  8.7 million in 1976-77 with reduction ofexpenditure of approximately  3 million in 1974-75 and 1975-76.10. Increases in the Social Security programme follow those made to theprogramme for Great Britain.

Table 2.16 summarises expenditure by central Government, local au-thorities and public corporations on services in Scotland within the Secretary ofState&apos;s field of responsibility. These figures are contained within the totals shownin tables 2.3 to 2.11 and 2.13 and objectives and main determinants of the ex-penditure are explained in the commentaries on those tables. The figures are at1973 Survey prices, and do not include provision for the relative price effect.2. Between 1973-74 and 1977-78, expenditure within the Secretary ofState&apos;s field would increase by an average of 1 -4 per cent a year. The trend ofexpenditure in Scotland is not markedly dissimilar from that for Great britain as a whole, though in the earlier years expenditure is affected by the relativelylarge programme of additional works for Scotland announced in July 1971, whichtotalled  76 million. If expenditure on this programme in 1973-74 is excludedthe average annual increase becomes about 2-0 per cent.3. The changes in the Scottish figures as compared with the totals in Cmnd.5178 revalued reflect both estimating and policy changes, though the former are more significant. The marked shortfall in the outturn for 1972-73, which was mainly on capital expenditure, is attributable in part to the strike in the buildingindustry and to slower progress than had been expected with the additional

Other estimating changes are in the forecasts for agriculturewhere higher prices have reduced the cost of agricultural support, nationalised industries where forecasts have been rephased to reflect reassessments of plant and machinery requirements, and housing where lower levels of new house-building in the public sector and much higher levels of improvement expendi-ture are allowed for.4. The policy changes consist of expenditure reductions including thoseannounced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21 May 1973 and those re-sulting from the rephasing of public works announced by the Prime Minister on8 October 1973, partly offset by the increased cost of rent rebates and allowances as a result of increasing the &quot;needs allowances&quot;.5. Table 2.17 gives forecasts of all current and capital expenditure of scottish local authorities, including a small amount within the fields of responsibility-responsibility of Departments other than the Scottish Office. In advance of the rate support grant settlement now being negotiated the figures of local authorities&apos;current expenditure in both Tables 2.16 and 2.17 are provisional. About half thecapital spending in the Secretary of State&apos;s field of responsibility is carried outby local authorities. The annual average increase of local authorities&apos; expenditure as shown in Table 2.17 between 1973-74 and 1977-78 is 00 per cent (00 per centif expenditure on the additional works programme in 1973-74 is excluded).

Includes theconsequences of changed estimates of eg population or the take-up of social security benefits.Policy changes resulting from changes in those previously existing policies(Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 104-7).Charges payments for goods and services, produced by non-trading activitiesof central and local government, which are netted off public expenditure. for inclusion as a charge, the payment must be related to the cost of provision ofthe goods and services and not be used to raise revenue. Examples are charges for school meals and for dental treatment. (Tables 3.8 to 3.10 above and Handbookon Methodology, Appendix A.)Contingency reserve an allowance for unforeseen expenditures and for expen-diture which cannot be quantified with sufficient accuracy to enable provision to be included in the appropriate programme line, including provision for any future upratings of the main social security benefits to increase their purchasingpower (Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 37-9).Counter-cyclical measures action to increase or to decrease public expendituretemporarily as part of the short-term management of demand in the economy.Debt interest the estimates represent the total payable to private and overseassectors by central government, local authorities and public corporations.
Demand on output the extent to which a particular category of expenditureimposes a demand on currently produced goods and services. Transfer payments(qv), when spent by the recipient, produce an indirect demand effect, which is usually lower than that of direct expenditure on goods and services (Handbookon Methodology, paragraphs 80-87).Directly related receipts receipts by central or local government, such as national insurance contributions, which are determined in relation to theadministration of particular services but which do not satisfy the conditions forCharges (qv).Gross domestic product the total value of the output of goods and servicesproduced within the country (see also Productive potential).Prices-(adjustments, constant, outturn, relative price effect, Survey) see section II below.Productive potential the capacity of the nation at a particular period of timeto produce goods and services. Productive potential varies with changes in the size of the working population, in the average number of hours worked and in productivity. The actual level of output Gross domestic product (qv) varieswith changes in the degree of use of productive capacity.Public corporations nationalised industries, New Town corporations andother enterprises publicly owned and managed in the public interest, as described in Chapter VII of &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and Methods&quot;.(Direct government trading activities are not included.)Public expenditure the current and capital expenditure of central governmentand local authorities, other than expenditure charged to the operating accountof trading bodies, together with the capital expenditure of nationalised industries and other public corporations, and including debt interest and net lending.The estimates of public expenditure in this White Paper are net of Charges (qv)and do not include imputed rent.Re-costing revised estimate at constant prices of the expenditure required to implement a given policy; not to be confused with Revaluation (qv), (Handbookon Methodology, paragraphs 106-7).Revaluation the process of adjusting estimates of expenditure to a differentprice basis in particular, adjusting estimates in the December 1972 White paper to take account of pay and price changes in the twelve months since thoseestimates were prepared; not to be confused with Recosting (qv) (Handbookon Methodology, paragraphs 102-3).Shortfall the net amount by which expenditure falls short of plans or forecasts for individual programmes; in recent years underspendings have exceededoverspendings and an overall allowance is made for this in estimates of totalexpenditure. (There is also a specific allowance for net underspending on fixed assets in the Nationalised industries programme.)
Supply expenditure by central government which is financed by monies votedby Parliament. Details are given in Supply Estimates and AppropriationAccounts.Transfer payments payments for which no goods or services are received inreturn. They include social security benefits, grants to individuals and companies,and debt interest.II Price basis(1)1. Unless otherwise stated, the figures of public expenditure in this white paper are expressed at constant prices. There are, however, two constant price series which serve different purposes, each having its own significanceand importance.In volume terms at 1973 Survey prices2. The figures embodied in this White Paper are first produced on theassumption that prices throughout the period covered have been, and willremain, at the levels prevailing at the base date for the annual (1973) Survey.Such figures are said to be &quot;at Survey prices&quot;. They measure changes in theamount of goods and services purchased by the public sector, and thus provide an indication of the volume of services supplied (hence they are sometimes also referred to as &quot;in volume terms&quot;). They are of importance both because pro-spective changes in the scale of individual services are a natural matter ofinterest and because it is in terms of these figures that the programmes arein practice controlled. Programmes have to be planned in terms of the under-lying activities (e.g. numbers of staff employed; goods and services purchased)needed to give effect to Government policies. These therefore are the figuresdisplayed throughout the individual programme tables in Part 2 and discussed in the accompanying commentaries.In cost terms including relative price effect3. However, the volume series implicitly assumes that, when prices rise,all prices rise equally. But in real life some prices move at different rates fromothers, and the price changes which determine the cost of public expenditure as a whole tend on average to move faster than prices generally. Similarly,within the total of public expenditure, the price changes which determine thecost of one programme move faster or more slowly than those determininganother, so that neither the past nor the prospective relative cost of two pro-grammes is adequately expressed by a series &quot;in volume terms&quot;. It is therefore necessary to adjust the past out-turns and future estimates of expenditure totake account of relative changes in prices (the &quot;relative price effect&quot;). Theapplication of this factor produces a series of figures &quot;in cost terms&quot; by meansof which comparisons can be made of the changing costs of different pro-grammes and of the share of total output which public expenditure as a whole will take in terms of the price levels of each year. The constant price baseused for this series is estimated 1973-74 outturn prices i.e. the average levelof prices actually paid in 1973-74. This is the series used in Table 1.1 in Part 1.(It is this series &quot;in cost terms&quot; which forms the basis of the calculation of therate of increase in the demand on real resources in paragraph 6 of Part 1.)i A more detailed account is given in Chapter IV of the Hanbdook on Methodology.
Price adjustments4. Both Table 2A, which shows the programme figures in cost terms atestimated 1973-74 outturn prices, and Table 2B, where the programme figures are at 1973 Survey prices, include a final line of price adjustments. In Table 2A,this line makes the necessary adjustment to 1973-74 outturn prices for certainCash programmes (see Glossary above), notably social security benefits, in-cluded in the main programme figures. In Table 2B, the line includes also the adjustments for all other programmes from 1973 Survey prices to 1973-74outturn prices (including the relative price effect) as shown in the followingtable._  million1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-78Adjustments to  1973-74outturn prices......Cash programmesOther programmesRelative price effectTotal       ......    841 865       890 1,073        1,276        1,541Foreign exchange rate5. Estimates of expenditure which are directly affected by foreign exchange rates reflect average rates prevailing in October 1973 i.e. the most recentrates when the figures were compiled. Actual payments will of course reflect the rates prevailing when those payments are made.Ill Classification changes1. During the debate on last year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper(Cmnd 5178), the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced that the Govern-ment planned to introduce a form of classification which would enable theSupply Estimates and the estimates in public expenditure White Papers tobe presented on the same functional basis. (Hansard, 7 February 1973, column464). Proposals were therefore submitted to and considered by the public accounts Committee and the Select Committee on Expenditure (Eighth Report,Session 1972-73, HC 209) and provide the basis for the new classification ofexpenditure used in this White Paper. The Supply Estimates for 1974-75 will use the same classification of main programmes, programmes and sub-programmes.2. By comparison with the classification previously used in public expenditure White Papers, there is a reduction in the number of main pro-grammes from 21 to 15. The reclassifications below main programme level which this has entailed are shown below:Main Programmes Equivalent former classificationDefence Defence budget other military defenceLess: Allied servicesMilitary aidOverseas services Overseas aidOther overseas servicesPlus: Military aidAgriculture, fisheries and forestry Agriculture, fisheries and forestryPlus: Covent Garden Market Authority

The following transfers between programmes reflect changes whichhave occurred since the 1972 public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 5178)in organisation and reassessment of the functions of some elements ofexpenditure:(a) Further works expenditure on buildings with specialised functions from Common services to the relevant programmes.(b) Some expenditure on Colleges of Education from Education andlibraries to Agriculture, fisheries and forestry.(c) Some expenditure on environmental improvement-from Roads andtransport to Other environmental services.(d) Expenditure  on concessionary fares from Other  environmental services to Health and personal social services.(e) Some expenditure on fire research from Other environmental services to Law, order and protective services.(/) Some expenditure on Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings from Common services to Other environmental services.(g) Expenditure on housing surveys from Other environmental services to Other public services.(h) Expenditure on Tyneside Rapid Transit project from Other environ-mental services to Roads and transport.(/)  Rail research from Roads and transport to Other environmental services.
4.   Five items are included for the first time in the Survey coverage:(a) Cost to local authorities of administering their non-Housing revenue account housing activities included in Housing.(b) Rate fund contributions to local authorities own trading organisations included in Other environmental services.(c) Current expenditure on cemeteries and crematoria included inOther environmental services.(d) Some previously unidentified capital expenditure on local authoritymiscellaneous services included in Other environmental services.(e) Rate fund contributions to Housing Associations included in Housing.These items increase public expenditure as presented in this White Paper by:  million at 1973 Survey prices1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77        1977-7863-2 74-6 76-6 79-0 81-5 84-5IV Notes on Table 1.4-The use of resources 1972-19781. Table 1.4 shows possible increases in the total supply of national economic resources and illustrates the way these increases may be divided between alternative uses. This line by line account explains what each part ofthe table means.2. Line A shows, for two alternative cases, the projected growth in total available resources between 1972 and 1978 as measured by the change inGross Domestic Product (GDP). The changes in GDP reflect both the growth of productive potential and an allowance for the taking up of slack in the economy which existed in 1972.3. In Section B, line I is an estimate of the claim on resources for privatefixed investment and stock building, excluding private dwellings. The relation-ship between the growth of the capital stock and the sustainable growth in output is inevitably very uncertain and for this reason two alternative estimates of investment are provided for each growth case.4. Line 2 is an estimate of the additional resources required to achieve a current account position sufficient to finance capital outflows and to maintain a satisfactory level of reserves. The additional resources are measured by the excess of the increase in exports of goods and services over the increase in imports of goods and services, each valued at constant 1972 prices. The differ-ence between the figures for the two alternative growth rates reflects the assump-tion that a higher level of GDP would be accompanied by higher imports andthat exports, in volume terms, would have to rise more than proportionatelyto imports in order to maintain the same current account position.5. Lines 3(a) to (e) give estimates of public expenditure on present pro-grammes. Although the rates of increase given here differ from those givenelsewhere in the White Paper the figures are consistent. The differences arisemainly because the changes are shown over different periods and because this table excludes the relative price effect. In addition the resource implications ofsome overseas public expenditure (such as transfer payments) are included in the
balance of trade rather than in public expenditure and, similarly, the resourceimplications of capital grants to industry are included in private investment.There are other minor differences of definition and coverage reflecting the useof national accounting definitions for the resources table.6. Lines 3(a) and (b) represent direct purchases of goods and services,^ublic investment includes both fixed investment and stock building. Line 3(d)represents indirect demands. It comprises the demands on resources resultingfrom various forms of payment to the domestic private sector such as subsidies,debt interest and current grants.7. Line 4 is the residual figure. It includes capital expenditure on privatedwellings (excluded from private investment in line 1) but excludes that partof consumers&apos; expenditure included in indirect public expenditure in line 3(d).8. All figures in Section B of the table are in terms of the demands theywill make on resources. This involves the deduction of any indirect tax content and, for transfer payments etc (line 3(d)), also involves allowance for direct taxation and savings. The calculation of demand effects is explained in ChapterV of &quot;Public Expenditure White Paper: Handbook on Methodology&quot;. the table has been constructed from the conventional national accounting presenta-tion of expenditure of constant prices by making the specific adjustments re-ferred to above. A full explanation and definition of the national accountingsystem and of the technical terms used here (viz fixed investment, public con-sumption, stock building, consumers&apos; expenditure and exports and imports ofgoods and services) is given in &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and methods&quot; (HMSO, 1968), especially Chapters I to III.
