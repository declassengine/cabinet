ROBENS REPORT - STATUS AND STAFFING OF the safety AND HEALTH organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. In considering the proposed legislation on health and safety atwork, the Home and Social Affairs Committee decided that, because ofthe importance of the itssues involved, the question of whether the health and Safety Commission (HSC) should have Crown status and be staffed by civil servants should be referred to the Cabinet.2. There are some very difficult questions of staff relations.The position is that the HSC will be taking over a wide range of duties,many of which are at present performed by staff of the Department ofEmployment.    Some staff from the Home Office, the Department ofTrade and Industry, the Department of the Environment and the scottish office are also involved.    The change will involve substantial transfers of staff to the new organisation.    This will be the second such change which has affected the Department of Employment within a short time,since a similr-r situation has very recently arisen in connection with theestablishment of the Manpower Services Commission (MSG).    The latter is not a Crown body and its staff will therefore not be civil servants.The consequential change of status has caused very great disquiet amongstthe staff concerned at the Department of Employment, and although it now seems likely that the change will be accepted, the discussions which havetaken place have been very difficult, and at this stage the new contracts have yet to be signed.    If the HSC were now given Crown status theSecretary of State for Employment fears that the resentment of the staff at seeing what they would regard as a comparable body being treateddifferently from the MSC(with the result that its staff could remain civilservants) would be so great that it would become quite impossible to staff the MSG.    Moreover, he fears that the resultant ill-will might endanger the HSC also,    It has to be borne in mind that the staff of theHSC are likely to be dispersed to the same site.CP(73) 129 COPY NO      g ^26 November, 1973CABINET
3. Thus there is an argument on staffing grounds for the HSC to havethe same status as the MSG.    On the other hand, at a recent meeting withthe Lord Privy Seal representatives of the National Staff Side indicated that since the legislation establishing the MSC was on the statute book theywould, though unwillingly, acquiesce in its being denied Crown status.But they argued strongly that the functions of the HSC were quite different (see paragraph 4) and that this fully justified Crown status.They asked for their views to be taken into account when a final decision was reached on this, and it is understood that the Staff Sides in deparments other than the Department of Employment would also prefer the new organisation, to have Crown status.    If the staff of the HSCwere denied Crown status not on the merits of the case but merely ioappease those due to be transferred to the MSC, they in their turn would greatly resent the decision.4. The question of principle is more straightforward.    Although oneof the bases underlying the establishment of both the MSC and the HSC isthat they should be managed by a body composed of representatives ofthe CBI, TUC and local authorities, the two Commissions are performingfunctions of different types.    The MSC wiD. essentially be providing services in the employment and industrial training fields;  but the HSC,while it will similarly be providing advice and services in the industrialsafety field, will be concerned additionally with regulation and enforce-ment of safety and health requirements over a wide range of industrial activity in the public and private sectors.    It is entirely proper thatthe former should be a non--Crown body;   but some of the functionsof the latter are such that there are substantial grounds for saying thatit should be publicly answerable in the way which can most appropriately be secured by Crown status.    This is not a conclusive argument - no major constitutional principle is at stake;  and there are examples ofnon-Crown bodies with important enforcement duties (the police are an example); but on balance the Committee thought that the arguments ofprinciple pointed to Crown status.    They accepted, however, that thebalance of the argument on the staffing problem might render this solutioninadvisable, and in view of the important issues at stake recommendedthat the question be considered by the Cabinet.5. In the light of the above, I invite my colleagues to decide what should be the status of the proposed Health and Safety Commission.R home Office26 November 19732
