THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(73) 135 COPY NO673 December 1973CABINETCONSERVATION OP FUEL supplies memorandum by the Lord President of the council at our last meeting (CP(73) 58th Conclusions, Minute 7) the cabinet invited me to circulate a paper on the further measures which mightbe taken to economise in the use of fuel.&apos; IkObjectives2.     CP(73) 133, the note by the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry on oil supplies to power stations, concludes that, on the worstassumptions on supplies of coal and oil - and if demand for all sources of fuel remains at its present level - a very serious situation would arise in early Februaryo   There would be widespread electricitydisconnections and some oil consumers would be without supplies for aperiod.3.     This paper considers measures to reduce demand for all types of fuel so as to postpone the date at which this situation would arise andso as to minimise the damage to industrial production and the distributionof essential goods, to reduce hardship to individual firms and companies and to avoid gross inequities, but yet to bring home to the public the seriousness of the position and the need for all measures of conservation.The Present situation&quot;     So far we have arranged for the oil companies to cut supplies of bothfuel oil and petrol by 13 per cent (10 per cent on last year&apos;s consumption)and we have made a general appeal for voluntary savings of a similaramount.   We have also prohibited the use of electricity for displaylighting and flood lighting and for the heating of commercial and other similar premises, and we have made an anti-hoarding Order.   To someextent these measures overlap.1
5.    A wide range of further measures has &quot;been suggested, bothvoluntary and statutory.,   Leaving aside petrol rationing, those ofwhich I am aware are listed and discussed briefly in the Annexes,Annex A consisting of those which seem to me to be the most realisticand Annex B of other possibilities considered but not recommended.,The Criteria for Assessment6.     One key factor is how effective the various measures will be.The Annexes give the available information about the savings from eachmeasure, but they are very difficult to assess with confidence oraccuracy.   In some cases a realistic assessment is clearly impossible,.Some measures, for example   Orders to limit the use of domesticheating, seem to be unenforceable, even if we took the undesirablestep of taking powers of forceable entry into people&apos;s homeso   But theimportance of savings on the domestic front makes it essential thatthere should be further appeals for voluntary co-operation in the home.7.     This brings us to the impact on public opinion.,   The Fuel and electricity (Control) Bill will give us wide powers over the supplyand use of fuel, but any measures we adopt will succeed only if publicopinion is convinced of the need.   They must also be equitable, betweenusers not only of particular fuels, but all fuels.   We must maintain,as far as possible, a balance between sacrifices imposed on the general public, cuts in the public sector and reductions in industry.   To what extent ought we to tilt that balance in favour of industrial production?We shall in any event need to ensure the careful public presentation ofany further measures.   Will public opinion demand restrictions where,although the savings would be insignificant, the consumption of fuelis conspicuous, eg motor racing?8.     Then there are the administrative problems.   Taking into accountthat we may need to introduce petrol rationing anyway, and that we are almost certainly going to need a more sophisticated, and therefore amore complicated, system of oil allocation, both of which requiresubstantial numbers of staff to deal with priority cases, exemptions,appeals, etc, we must ensure that the Government machine will be able2
to cope with further measures requiring control of fuel supplyor consumption,9-     It is perhaps most convenient to consider the measures setout in Annex A under three headings, those which control supplies and those which reduce demand, which in turn can he sub-divided intothe restriction of use and persuasion, including the control of prices,a. Control of Supplies10.   We should consider whether the time has yet come to introducefurther control over the supplies of fuel at source.   Some problemsare already emerging under the system of 10 per cent cuts in allocationby the oil companies.   The Secretary of State for Trade and Industryis considering if and when we should intensify the level of cut with,as necessary, a wider priority list of industries.   He will be makingseparate recommendations on restrictions on electricity supply on a planned basis, the scope for which is limited daring the ban on stand-byduties by the power engineers.   The supply of coal can be readilycontrolled at source, but the present objective is to keep a maximumflow moving down the distribution line, while preserving distributors&apos;stocks for possible priority allocations.   Some limited control of gassupplies may be justified, to ensure the maximum availability at thetwo power stations which can operate on gas and to preserve naphthafor other purposes.   We must, however, also consider how long the10 per cent cuts in deliveries of motor spirit to dealers can, bemaintained without the need for rationing.b. Control of Demand11.   If we wish to ration motor fuel, the earliest this could nowstart is 20 December.   To enable people to decide whether they need to apply for business and/or supplementary coupons we should have to announce our decision at least a week ahead, and at the same timegive details of the size of the rations.   This means a decision before13 December if rationing is to start before the New Year.
12o   Whether or not we want to introduce petrol rationing before theNew Year there is a strong case, at least on psychological grounds, foradopting other measures to restrict consumption of the various fuels,,There are a wide range of measures which can be taken,,   Those which ^avebeen principally canvassed, and some others, are discussed in the Annexes.Some can be the subject of Government control, others must depend on anappeal for voluntary co-operation.   We would clearly not want to introducecontrols related to the consumption of motor spirit if we were likely todecide to introduce petrol rationing quickly, but further appeals for voluntary co-operation in savings in these fields, to supplement theother measures, would still be possible.c.     Rationing by Price130   Demand can be restricted by price increases, but changes in therelative price of fuels may have to. be substantial to have a significant effort.   But price or tax increases have implications for industrial costs and consumer prices and so for our counter-inflationary policy.   A highertax on petrol could be offset by a reduction in, or even the abolition of,the road fund licence fee.   I am aware of the difficulties in the latter course, but it may merit examination at the present time especially.14.   It is clearly important that we do not overlook longer-term measuresto conserve fuel, for example the more efficient burning of coal and oil,and the better insulation of buildings.   I understand that the central policy Review Staff, in consultation with the Department of Trade andIndustry and the Department of the Environment, expect to be bringing forward proposals for longer-term measures to conserve fuel supplies in about a month&apos;s time.Conclusions15&quot;   On the information in CP(73) 133 there is a real risk we shall bereaching the minimum safe level for oil supplies and for coal stocks atpower stations during early February.   We must take a further decisionvery shortly on petrol rationing.   In addition, as a prelude to the muchmore severe measures which it is evident may have to follow if we are tosurvive the winter without severe disruption, we must now take such further conservation steps as we can.   At the same time, we must launch afurther national appeal, supported by another publicity campaign, to securepublic support for the voluntary effort we require in the saving of allfuels.   We must also support this appeal by action, where possible, to demonstrate the savings being achieved.4 ) - . ( \;:: :
Re oommendat ions16 o     I recommend that we should!(l) Take a decision before 13 December on whether petrol rationing needs to be introduced before the New Year.   Thiswould provide time, if the decision were to do so, to make anannouncement about the size of the ration before the issue,ofbusiness and/or supplementary rations starts.(2) Now take the necessary steps to introduce the measures for the conservation of fuel set out in Annex Ao   If we decidebefore 13 December to ration motor spirit the action on no. 3 (the reduction of deliveries), No, 5 (stopping motoringon Sundays) and No. 6 (a maximum 50 mph speed limit) should be confined to appeals for voluntary co-operation.(3) At the same time launch a further campaign for voluntarysavings in all fuels.J P/1IIPrivy Council Office3 December 19735
