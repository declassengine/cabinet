POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland, The talks which I have been holding with the Parties in NorthernIreland in preparation for the formation of an Executive have now reached a critical phase.    The purpose of this paper is to outline the backgroundand to indicate the lines of action I have rn mind, subject to the outcome ofthe discussions I shall be having in Belfast on Monday and Tuesday of thisweek - on which I shall be reporting orally.2. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 provides for theformation of an Executive which commands support in the Assembly and islikely to be widely accepted throughout the community.    In practice this involves the coming together of the Ulster Unionist Party led byMr Brian Faulkner, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) andthe Alliance Party.    The other Parties had set their faces against power-sharing in any form.3. The talks with the three Parties concerned have been, as expected,protracted.    The Parties have had to have time to develop their policies,to get to know each other both during the talks and during the debates in theAssembly and to define much more clearly than had been done before what their attitude was to certain key issues.    I have, therefore, been takingthem through these issues, and we have now virtually covered all the ground,,4.        It is to the credit of the Parties taking part that there have beenconcessions on all sides.    The Unionist Party have been brought to acceptpower-sharing (despite a large Unionist splinter group in the Assembly and considerable difficulty with their support throughout the country); the SDLPhas agreed publicly to accept the constitutional position as set out in theNorthe rn Ireland Constitution Act 1973.    The talks have led to an agreementbetween those Parties on an economic and social programme (concerningthe whole field of activity which would be devolved from Westminster.    Astatement has been made by me on the law, order and policing which has gone a long way towards setting this problem on one side;  and althoughsomething more may have to be said on detention, this too should not become an issue on which the Parties will break.    There is always thepossibility that the Parties may return to any of these issues but we haveriow covered really all the ground.1i 67CP(73) 125 COPY NO13 November 1973CABINET
5. We now need to move decisively and quickly,,    The Part5.esthemselves have been brought to a position in which the formation of an executive is a real possibility: the Dublin Government is pressing us for adecision on a Tripartite Conference which, as I say below, is inextricablyinvolved in the formation of an Executive;  and in Northern Ireland the airof expectancy in many quarters for the present belies the very real risk that a continuing political vacuum will lead to increasing violence from bothsides.    But we cannot finally decide what to do at least until we know how the talks go in the early part of this week.    The main and continuingproblem has been the weakness of the Unionist Party; Brian Faulkner&apos;sleadership is going to be called in question at a meeting of their 900 strongCouncil on 20 November.    There is no doubt that he must be kept afloat ifan Executive is to be formedo    The vote at the meeting of the Council islikely to be a very close-run thing.    If agreement on the Executive with an absolute Unionist majority can be reached before then, Brian Faulknerought to be able to survive.    But the SDLP and the Alliance Party have upto now set their faces against a Unionist majority.    Further, the SDLP andthe Unionist Party are still far apart on the timing of the TripartiteConference, the one saying (with support from Dublin) that it should bebefore the formation of the Executive and the other that it should be after.6.        If we are to succeed, our line of action must bring both the unionist party and the SDLP along with us;  and it must also not set the DublinGovernment or the Opposition against us.    There will, therefore, have tobe a &quot;package&quot; and the outline might possibly be as follows a. There should be an absolute majority for the Unionist party on the Executive and we should take our stand on the provisions ofSection 2(i)(b) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, which covers both the balance of Parties in the Assembly and the electorate as a whole.b. The post of Chief Executive Member should be offered toBrian Faulkner; the post of Deputy should go to Gerry Fitt, leader of the SDLP, and Community Relations can go to Oliver Napier,leader of the Alliance Party.    In all 6 posts ought to go to Unionists,4 to the SDLP;  and 2 to the Alliance (one of which would not be amember of the Executive),c. A statement should be made on detention.    We shall have to announce our long-term aim of doing away with detention when thesecurity situation allows and take some small steps which maymollify the SDLP.d. But, above all, we shall have to be as clear as possible on a council of Ireland.    On this, we have to steer our way through thedifferent Party positions.    It is advisable to lean towards the SDLPposition as a quid pro quo for the proposed Unionist majority on an executive.    I believe that Brian Faulkner can go a long way on a council of Ireland provided he has an overall majority.    We willhave to confirm Her Majesty!s Governments commitment to a Councilof Ireland and our willingness to see executive powers vested in it byagreement and to discuss the part it might play in those matters atpresent reserved to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.secret
e, We have got to find a way out of the impa3se between theParties on the timing of a Tripartite Conference,    We should,therefore, aim at preliminary consultations in which Westminsterand Dublin would be involved.    These should be in England,    there could well be advantage in inviting all the Northern Ireland Partiesto these consultations - indeed, paragraph 112 of the White Paperreierred to leaders of the elected representatives participating in aconference.    This meeting could be arranged this month and the aim would be to allow all the Parties to have a general exchange of views and identify points of agreement and disagreement.    It might,if necessary and advisable, be followed by a meeting between PrimeMinisters in December in England at which the aims, functions and composition of a Council of Ireland might be agreed and announced.There might then be a Tripartite Conference within a month of theExecutive being formed,f. We should announce our willingness to secure the approvalof Parliament to a devolution of power on 1 January 1974,7,        As we have always known, there would come a time when we wouldhave to move decisively if we are to succeed.    It is becoming clear that-if we do not act very quickly now, the situation may well slip away from us.Indeed, it may be necessary to move this week and timing will be crucial,8,        By the time that we consider this paper I shall be able to reporthow the talks in the early part of the week have gone but I thought it rightto let my colleagues know the present position together with ar indication of the approach that may be necessary at an early date.W WNorthern Ireland Office12 November 19733
