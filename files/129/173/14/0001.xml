THE Yamani/ABDESSELAM TALKS: OIL SUPPLIESNote by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry10 Sheikh Yamanl and M Abdesselam met the Prime!Minister, theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister for Industry inseparate talks on Thursday 29 November 1973.    The Secretary of Statefor Defence had seen Yamani at dinner the previous evening (seeCM(73) 58th Conclusions, Minute 2)0    Some of the conversations were more specific than others; but the following summarises our impressionsof what Yamanl, speaking specifically on behalf of all the Arab oilproducing countries (M Abdesselam signified his assent to what hadbeen said), said about oil supplies,PRODUCTION RESTRICTIONSi. Total production had been cut to 75 per cent of the september 1973 level and there was no question of increasingproduction above this level until a satisfactory political solutionof the Israeli problem had been found.ii. Further progressive cuts of 5 per cent per month would beapplied on the previous month!s figures.    The Arab countries1capacity to withstand such progressive cuts without economicdamage to themselves varied;  accordingly, some countries would reach a plateau below which no further cuts would be made rathersooner than others,iii. In recognition of the statements made by the european economic Community (e.c.) and by Japan, all or most of the december cut of 5 per cent had been cancelled;  this did not howeveraffect the January and subsequent cuts,ALLOCATION OF SUPPLIESiv. Consuming countries were divided into three categories:a. &quot;Friendly&quot; countries^ which included Britain, Franceand Spain, together with most of Africa^ India, Pakistan andsome others.CP(73) 134 COPY NO       g V3 December 1973CABINET
b. Embargoed countries, including the United Statesand the Netherlands^ and probably South Africa,c. &quot;Neutral&quot; countries, including e.c. members otherthan Britain, France and the Netherlands,,v. Countries in the &quot;friendly&quot; category would receive theaverage amount supplied in the nine months to September 1973,or the September 1973 leveL, whichever was the higher0    Thiswould not be reduced in line with the 5 per cent production cuts,,When speaking to the Prime Minister, Yamani seemed willing toconsider a higher level of supply, but spoke in general terms0vi0        But it was quite clear that Yamani expected countries in the&quot;neutral&quot; category to absorb the full effect of the progressive 5 percent cuts in total Arab oil productions including that part going to&quot;friendly&quot; countries like the United Kingdom.vii. Yamani said Saudi Arabia could effectively monitor these arrangements, but other countries^ like Kuwait? might be less ableto do so.    Accordingly any preference for friendly countries fromthese latter sources might, be leas likely,viii. Saudi Arabia was willing to examine the fact that some countries like Britain drew oil products from Rotterdam.    Yamaniasked for details of the 180, 000 barrels a day of which we claimed to be short because of this, and specifically from which companiesthis was received, and from what countries crude the productswere refined.    If it were possible to make special arrangements to provide crude to the United Kingdom to compensate for this., itwould be at the expense of the &quot;neutral&quot; countries,, like germany or Italy, since the total production was settled as in ii, and iii.above.ix. Yamani acknowledged that under these arrangements theUnited Kingdom would not receive as much oil as they would other-wise have expected to receive in forthcoming months, since themost favourable base period (September 1973) would not allow forseasonal or growth factors.   Even if, as a political matter, theArab countries were to agree to any additional supply to the UnitedKingdom (on which Yamani gave little encouragement), he said thatthis would be at the expense of the &quot;neutral&quot; countries includingEEC partners and Japan.P w department of Trade and Industry30 November 1973
