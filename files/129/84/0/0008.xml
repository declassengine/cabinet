AGRICULTURAL POLICY:  LONG TERM ASSURANCESReport by the Ministerial Committee onthe Farm Price JReviewThe proposals approved by the Cabinet on 24th October(CM.(56) 73rd Conclusionsk Minute 6)have been put to the Farmers&apos; Unions.We have been considering the political and financial implications ofcertain important points that they have raised.2. On the proposals relating to the guarantees they have asked forreconsideration of (a) the proposal to abolish the provision in the agriculture Act, 1947 for special reviews and (b) the proposal that the assurance relating to the total support to the industry should be at thelevel of 97 per cent of the total value of the guarantees.Special Reviews3. The English Farmers&apos; Union have pressed most strongly that theprovision in the Agriculture Act, 1947 for special reviews should beretained.    But they have suggested that they would agree to a proposalrestricting the circumstances in which a special review is in fact held.Even if the Union could be brought to accept a package deal that included the abolition of provision for special reviews, they would be certain to insist on making a strong reservation on the point.   It would then befought in Parliament on the necessary amendment to the Agriculture Act,1947.   This is the only controversial amendment of the Act likely to be involved in our proposals.    The Opposition, trade unions and rural opinion would be likely to join forces on it.4. There is a possible alternative.   This is to work out, inconsultation with the Farmers&apos; Unions, a convention to determine thecircumstances in which a request for a special review would be accepted -as the Farmers&apos; Unions have suggested might be possible.    Our aim would need to be a convention that would go far towards eliminating specialreviews in practice.5. Our conclusion is that, in view of the serious opposition we shouldencounter in Parliament to the abolition of the Agriculture Act provisionfor special reviews and of the damage that a serious Farmers&apos; Unionreservation on the point might cause to our whole object of regaining the farmers&apos; confidence in our agricultural policies, we should seek insteada convention that would have much the same effect in practice.   this might take the form of, for example, an arrangement under which the cost increase must be at least  x millions for a special review to be held.Assurances relating to total support6. The proposal put to the Farmers&apos; Unions was an undertaking tomaintain the total value of the guarantees at not less than the sum of(a) 97 per cent of their prevailing value and (b) any cost increases sincethe last annual review.    While the Unions accept the general line of this proposed assurance, they have asked that the percentage should be 98 butcoupled, as an offset to the higher level of guarantee, with provision for taking account of cost decreases as well as cost increases.   Theirdifficulty is that the 97 per cent level could mean a reduction of nearly 35 millions a year in the value of the guarantees if there is no cost increase and that this will not give the necessary confidence to farmers.-1-
7. The difference in room for manoeuvre between 98 and 97 per centis about  11 j millions a year on the present value of the guarantees.    Whilethe Farmers&apos; Unions may continue to stand out for more than 97 per cent,we are agreed that 98 -oer cent would leave too little room for manoeuvreand is unacceptable.    The question is whether we should go to 97-1 percent - with an allowance for cost decreases which might on occasion beof value at that level of assurance.8. The effect of 97 j per cent as against 97 per cent would be areduction of about  5-6 millions in the scope for curtailing, the total valueof the guarantees each year, in the Government^ room for manoeuvre atannual reviews,, and in the possibilities for adjusting the guarantees for individual commodities, as follows -(i)   The Governments scope for reducing the total value of the guarantees would be curtailed from about  34^ millions toabout  29 millions.   This might not matter unless in any year we were seriously concerned to get down to, or very close to, the minimumpermissible.  In that event it would lessen the amount by which we could reduce the value of the guarantees, and perhaps have wider effects ifwe were expecting that such a reduction (on top of the reduction of 29 millions less cost increases that we should be able to make in anycase) would have an influence on output that would reduce Exchequerliability more than in direct proportion to the reduction in the value ofthe guarantees.(ii)   The Government could never start at an annual review below the minimum guarantee which may therefore have an effecton their starting point and so affect the end point or the point at which agreement can be reached.    On the other hand, past experience does notindicate that any great advantage is to be gained by wide differences instarting positions between the Government and the farmers.(iii)   In the extreme case that we should wish toreduce all the guaranteed prices in a single year by the maximum allowedunder the assurances for individual commodities, a total reduction ofabout  44 millions would be involved.   This compares with a maximum of 34^ millions permissible under an assurance at 97 ner cent and of 29 millions at 97 j per cent of the total value of the guarantees.   Milk,pigs, eggs and cereals are the products on which we are most likely to need to consider maximum reductions at the same time - whether in theinterests of production policy, Exchequer liability or commercial relations.Taking these commodities, the difference between 97 per cent and 97^ percent would be that, before allowing for any increase in costs, 97 per cent would permit a reduction of 4 per cent in the price guarantees for all fourcommodities, whereas 97j per cent would, for example, permit a reductionof 3 per cent in the guarantee for milk, and 4 per cent on the other threeproducts.   No other reductions would in either case be possible unlesscompensating increases were to be made at the same time.The above presupposes no decrease in costs.   If there were costdecreases there would be more scope for reducing the guarantees on the97-1 per cent alternative.-2-
Grants for Permanent Farm Improvements9. Discussions on this particular scheme are proceeding withrepresentatives of the farmers and of the landowners.   They are likely topress for reconsideration of the proposed 33^- per cent rate of grant.    If,as we estimate, the proposed 33g- per cent rate of grant is likely to cost about  50 millions in grant over ten years, a differential system consistingof 3.3g per cent grant on the first  10 expenditure per acre of holding and50 per cent grant on any expenditure in excess of   1 0 per acre would belikely to cost about  65 millions.   A flat rate of 40 per cent or 50 per centmight cost about  70 millions or  100 millions respectively.    But we donot at this stage contemplate any alteration in regard to the rate of grant proposed.Financial Implications10.        The financial implications of any amendment of our proposalsappear to be as follows -(i) on the special review - no real effect if we can get aconvention that virtually makes the special reviewprovision inoperative;(ii) on the percentage for the general assurance - a directdifference of some  5 to  6 millions, which may or may not have a similar real effect;(iii)   on the rate of grant for permanent farm improvements -at least  15 millions over ten years.Conclusions11.        Our conclusions are -(i)   We should concede that provision for special reviewsshould remain in the Agriculture Act, but we should seek to agree with the Farmers&apos; Unions on aconvention which would make the holding of suchreviews most unlikely in practice; while we should hope to get the Unions1 agreement to a convention that would achieve this, we might be prepared toconsider something rather less good if this meantgaining the wholehearted support of the Unions for theproposals as a whole.(ii) We should decide whether, in return for a satisfactoryconvention on the special review as well as whole-hearted support for the proposals as a whole, weshould be prepared to offer- 97^- per cent for thepercentage for the general assurance, with allowance for cost decreases as well as cost increases, insteadof 97 per cent with allowance for cost increasesalone.(iii) We should not at this stage contemplate any alterationof the rate of grant proposed for permanent farmimprovements.5th November, 1956
