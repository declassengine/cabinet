Hi ICP.(56) 252COPY NO*030th October, 1956CAB INETCOMMERCIAL POLICY (PLAN G)Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of trade the consultations about Plan G, with both sides of industry and withthe Governments concerned, are proceeding satisfactorily.   We are preparing a paper for consideration by the Cabinet, reviewing the resultsand making definite proposals.   Meanwhile, we would like our colleagues&apos;advice on timing.2. If the Cabinet decide to go ahead with Plan G, the next step will bea public announcement that Her Majesty!s Government have decided to enterinto negotiations in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operationwith the purpose of bringing about, on acceptable terms, a mutual free trade area (excluding foodstuffs) in Europe.3. 7/e think it would be unwise to make any announcement ofGovernment policy in this matter in the course of the Debate on the address.   Throughout our consultations with industry we have been seeking to treat the project in a bi-partisan manner, as indeed is necessary in a project which cannot come to full fruition until the early 1970s.4. It would be most suitable, if we go ahead, to arrange for a day5sdebate on this subject alone, and to make the announcement of theGovernment11 s policy at the start of this debate.   This would come most conveniently a few days after the Debate on the Address (say, in the week beginning 19th November), and the intention to arrange this s&amp;cnXd be announced in time to forestall a premature and unsatisfactory discussionof these matters during the Debate on the Address,5. If this view is accepted, we will submit our paper for considerationby the Cabinet in the course of next week.    We should by then havereceived any further comments that Commonwealth Governments may wishto make.H.M.P.T.30th October, 1956
TARIFF POLICY:  MEATNote by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food on 3rd October the Cabinet approved proposals for theopening of negotiations with Australia and New Zealand for a preferentialtariff on meat.    (CM.(56) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.        It has since become clear that New Zealand is not anxious orready to discuss meat at present, and that there might be advantage tous in deferring an offer of a preferential tariff until the New zealand government, who appear to be recognising that they have little hope ofsecuring quantitative restriction of Argentine meat imports, have had more time to convince their farmers.3.        These considerations are reinforced by the desirability of holding the meat negotiations quite separately and at a different time from those at present being conducted with the Australians for a newTrade Agreement.    To embark on meat discussions now would be ofno help to the general negotiations and would simply delay a general settlement, without any positive advantage.4.        For these reasons I have agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Commonwealth Secretary and the President of theBoard of Trade that the tariff negotiations should be postponed.In view of the representations we have received from our own farmersI would propose that this postponement should not be too long and thatwe should aim at opening talks early in the New Year.D.H*A.COPY NO.CABINETMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,S.W.I. ,30th October, 1956.SECRETCP.(56) 25330th October, 19J56,.
