THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1956SECRET Copy No. 51CP. (56) 2608th November, 1956CABINETINDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITYMemorandum by the Postmaster general in order that independent television should not be wholly dependent uponadvertising revenue, a Section was inserted in the Act, (Section 11), at theGovernments instance, empowering the Postmaster General to make a grant tothe Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) not exceeding  750,000 in any onefinancial year. A selection of Government statements relating to this Section is appended.2. In July the Home Affairs Committee decided that a claim for  750,000under this Section from the Independent Television Authority for a grant in1956-57 should be rejected on economic grounds (H.P. (56) 15th Meeting, Item 4).This led to a letter of resignation to me from the Chairman of the Authority,Sir Kenneth Clark, and of one of its members Miss Dilys Powell. Sir KennethClark wrote that rejection of the claim indicated a fundamental change in theGovernments attitude to the I.T.A., which would make it virtually impossible forthe Authority to carry out its statutory obligation to ensure that, so far as possible,programmes maintained a proper balance in their subject matter and a high generalstandard of quality.3. After discussion, Sir Kenneth Clark and Miss Dilys Powell withdrew theirresignations pending the Governments decision for the next financial year.4. The Authority has now presented a claim for a grant of  515,000 in1957-58. The outright rejection of this claim will be followed by the resignation of the Chairman, Miss Dilys Powell and perhaps other members of the Authority.But for the unqualified nature of the Governments statements, I should be inclined to recommend rejection of the claim.5. The Home Affairs Committee consider that in view of the unequivocalnature of Government statements in 1954, outright rejection of the claim would be embarrassing (H.P. (56) 18th Meeting, Item 7).6. The Authority have asked for  515,000. I believe that they would regard 100,000 as fulfilling the Governments promises and sufficient to make someimpact on programmes. If a grant is made, it should be made clear to the authority that it is intended as a purely temporary device to tide them over a difficult period and that it implies no claim or right to continuing Exchequer assistance.7. I therefore ask my colleagues to consider whether the claim of theIndependent Television Authority for a grant under Section 11 of the TelevisionAct for the year 1957-58 should be accepted; and if so, what such sum should be.8. As a statement of the facts on which a decision is required, this paper has been agreed with the Financial Secretary, Treasury.C. H.General Post Office, E.C. 1,6th November, 1956.50751
AppendixSTATEMENTS  BY GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN DURING debates on THE TELEVISION BILL&quot; There is one important change in the Governments scheme since the white paper was issued, namely, the proposal to give the new Authority some revenueindependent of advertising. Clause 8 of the Bill (now Section 11 of the Act)provides for an annual grant of up to  750,000.&quot; (Sir David Maxwell Fyfe:25 th March, 1954.)&quot; .... if we were to lay, as we have done, obligations on this Authority todo certain things, we felt it was quite logical to provide it with the money withwhich to do them.&quot; (Mr. Gammans: 29th March, 1954.)&quot; We are giving the Authority  750,000 a year.&quot; (Mr. Gammans: 27th May,1954.)&quot;In the Financial Resolution connected with the Bill, we decided that theAuthority should have an income of up to  750,000 a year of its own which it canuse to maintain a proper balance of programmes.&quot; (Mr. Gammans: 22nd June,1954.)&quot; First of all it has basic money which it can use for programmes for balancingor filling gaps. It is entirely in the judgment of the I.T.A. what is a balancedprogramme.&quot; (The Earl of Selkirk : 1st July, 1954.)&quot; &apos; Commercial&apos; .... is not a fully accurate description of a system which,after all, is going to have a public subvention of  750,000 a year.&quot; (Earl De LaWan : 12th July, 1954.)&quot; Of course I informed him perfectly correctly that this  750,000 was available .... I also said that I thought it would be more likely to be used forthis purpose in the first two or three years of the operation of the scheme, beforethe companies had got on to a profit-earning basis, and that later on they would pay for such things.&quot; (Earl De La Warr: 13th July, 1954.)&quot; Of course, the purpose of granting this money is that the whole scheme should not be entirely dependent on advertisements. First, it is there to helpensure balance, and your Lordships will see why I am talking rather conditionally.These companies may be of such high calibre, so well capitalised and with revenuecoming in so quickly, that they can produce, right from the beginning, a completelybalanced programme. If so, so much the better; why waste public money when their own revenues will give us what we want? But perhaps in the first year ortwo they will be building up slowly, and some of what we should consider the mostimportant programmes may be difficult for them to provide and pay for out of advertisements. It will then be possible for the I.T.A. to decide whether a certaintype of programme should go on and say to the programme companies: &apos; we recognise that you cannot pay for these programmes out of your revenue and we, as the I.T.A., will make ourselves responsible for their provision &apos;.&quot; (Earl De La Warr: 14th July, 1954.)
