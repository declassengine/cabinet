illSECRETC.P.(57) 12 COPY NO. j f9th January, 1957.CABINETFEDERATION OF MALAYAMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs think it is necessary to circulate an interim report on thediscussions in which I am concurrently engaged with the Chief Ministerand his colleagues from the Federation of Malaya, in case it is necessaryto discuss certain matters arising on the financial side of these talkslater this week.     The Chief Minister returns to Malaya on Friday,11th January.2. The object of the Chief Minister&apos;s visit has been to complete the main negotiations for a E&apos;defence Agreement with the United Kingdom,to come into force when Malaya becomes independent;   and to discuss a request by the Government of the Federation of Malaya for financialassistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government over the period of the next five years.defences. The defence negotiations have gone well, and agreement hasbeen reached on all the main outstanding points.     There remain some veryminor points of detail which cannot for various reasons be disposed ofat present.     It is hoped to clear these at a final meeting in Malaya inFebruary, after which there will be a formal exchange of letters betweenthe Governments accepting the agreed text of the Agreement and undertaking that it will be signed without alteration when Malaya becomes independent.finance. The negotiations have not been concluded, and the principalpurpose of this paper is to acquaint my colleagues with the position I havereached.5. These financial discussions originated in certain promises of help made at the time of the Malayan Constitutional Conference in Februarylast year.    These related principally to assistance in setting up Malaya&apos;sown armed forces and in meeting the cost of the emergency.   Since then the Malayan Government have been working on a five-year plan of social and economic development for their country which in fact represents thegeneral programme of development on which they were elected to office.The plan is well-conceived, though ambitious.6. Shortly before the Malayan Delegation arrived, the chief minister submitted to the Colonial Secretary his formal request for financial assistance.    The help he sought was under three headings.    He-1-
4 s &amp;asked Her Majesty&apos;s Government to meet the capital cost of the armed forces programme.    He asked Her Majesty&apos;s Government, in recognition of the fact that the fight against the Communist terroristswas part of the world-wide struggle against Communism, to meet halfthe cost of the emergency in Malaya while it lasted.    And he asked for substantial help towards the development programme.7.       I have set out in Annex 1 to this paper the details of the Malayanrequest and of the reply which after an examination of the figures putforward by the delegation, I was able in agreement with the chancellor to make to them.8.      The Chief Minister has expressed great disappointment atthis response to his request.     I attach at Anriex 2 a copy of the formal statement he made to me.     It will be seen from this that the chief minister has accepted the principle that we cannot give direct aid for development purposes to independent members of the Commonwealth,but that he claims this strengthens his case for asking us to. help him a little further in a number of other directions.    1 am at presentconsidering in consultation with the Treasury how far we can meet any of the requests contained in his statement.9.      It may be necessary for the Cabinet to consider the outcome of these discussions,for the whole matter of financial help for thenew Malaya poses difficult questions of political rather than financialjudgment.    The Malayan Ministers have asked for help in one formor another of nearly  100 millions.     We at the moment are offeringthem  36 millions (see Appendix 1, paragraph 9).     It is not possible on the figures produced by the Federation Government either toestablish or to disprove a need in any particular amount;   and we must recognise that any help we now promise to Malaya is chiefly to be madeavailable for political reasons.10.     Both Sir Donald MacGillivray, the High Commissioner andSir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for the United kingdom in South East Asia, have urged on the Colonial Secretary thedesirability of reaching a settlement which, while not coming up toMalayan demands, can be presented and defended by the moderateelements in Malaya as being reasonably generous in Britain&apos;present financial circumstances.    Their concern is that the enormousBritish capital at stake in Malaya, and our vital defence interests,should not be prejudiced by our sending the Chief Minister back witha proposition which even he,whose goodwill towards this countryremains undiminished, could not defend against the attacks of the more extreme anti- Western elements in the country.11.    I fully share their concern.     Our offer of  36 millions isgenerous looked at from a financial point of view.     But I am sure thatit will have to be stepped up and readjusted in one or two particulars.From what the Malayan Ministers have said privately in the last day or two, the offer is insufficient to enable them to carry it through their executive Council or to justify to the country at large their policy ofrelying upon Great Britain for support for their development and their defence.     Indeed, what they feel to.be the inadequacy of our offer may even prejudice their ability to persuade their people to accept theDefence Agreement which has been so satisfactorily settled during therecent talks.Colonial Office, S.W.1.8th January, 1957.J.H.
In the White Paper on the Malayan  Constitutional Conferenceof January 1956 (Cmd. 9714) Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognised thatit was most important that the Federation should go forward to independence within the Commonwealth in circumstances which wouldgive a fair assurance of its future financial stability.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment also recognised the Federations vital position in the world-wide struggle against Communism, and that operations in the militarysphere must be backed by a sound and vigorous programme of economicand social development.    The target date for independence within theCommonwealth was set at August 1957 and is unchanged.2.      In the White Paper both sides acknowledged that independenceimplied financial self-sufficiency but Her Majesty&apos;s government recognised that it was in the common interest to end the emergency and stated that, if the emergency had not ended by the date of independence, it would be prepared to consider with the federation government whether the financial needs of the Federation would justifyspecial United Kingdom assistance towards the cost of the emergencyover and above the substantial assistance which would continue to begiven through meeting the cost of the United Kingdom forces fightingCommunism in Malaya.3.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government also undertook to make available tothe Federation after independence the following aid:(a) the unspent balance of the agreed programme of aidtowards the capital cost of the expansion of theFederation Armed Forces;(b) the equivalent of the unspent balance of theFederation Colonial Development and Welfareallocations;(c) in accordance with earlier promises a loan to theFederation to enable it to finance its contributionto the Tin Buffer Stock should it be unable toobtain the necessary finance from any other suitable source;(d) Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready at all times to examine sympathetically with theF federation its borrowing needs on the -london market in connection with its development plans.Federations request for aid4.     The Federation^ estimates show a gap of  60 millions on capital account and over  33. 5 millions on recurrent account on thefive years 1956-60 after taking account of (d) below.    They have askedHer Majesty&apos;s Government for aid after independence under four heads:(a)  an annual grant equal to 50 per cent of the cost of theemergency and estimated at a total of  33. 5 millions over  years from 1.1.56;
-   iSS(b) capital aid in cash or kind towards the expansionof the Federation Armed Forces amounting to 15.75 millions in all during the same period or  9. 25 millions more than the aid already-promised (see paragraph 2(a) above);(c) a long-term Exchequer loan at special rates ofinterest of  44. 1 millions for development inaddition to the balance of the Colonial development and Welfare allocation mentioned in paragraph3(b) above;(d) access to the London Market for loans totalling 10 millions Over the period.Requests (b), (c) and (d) are based on a capital programme (armed forces and development) of  158. 5 millions during the 5 years from 1st January, 1956.    The United Kingdom delegation did not challengethe scale or content of the development programme.    Nor did itchallenge the Federations assumptions with regard to the rubber and tin prices which, though conservative, seemed the best availableestimates insofar as these prices can be estimated in present unsettledworld conditions.    The Federation delegation admitted that theirassessment of capacity was optimistic, particularly in the light of the uncertainty about the future of expatriate staff, but maintained thatthe programme might be achieved in 5 to 6-years and that it was in anycase necessary for political reasons to present the programme broadlyas submitted to the Colonial Office.5. The results of the Colonial Office analysis, which the Federationcould not accept, were as follows:(a) the capital programme could not be carried out in less than 6 years from 1st January 1956 or years from the present time;(b) est estimated local resources should be increased bythe addition of at least  11.7 millions (about15 per cent of the Federations share) from the currency Funds:   and by about  11.1 millions from other local funds resulting from the extensionof the capital programme over an additional year;(c) the local revenue figure should be increased to allow for the natural tendency to expand, which is already established, and adjustments should be made to take account of an additional year&apos;s revenue andexpenditure on the recurrent side.These changes together with the inclusion of the unspent balance ofthe Armed Forces grant already promised and a small alteration in thefigure of the Colonial Development and Welfare balance reduce very considerably the residual overall gap assumed by the Federation,referred to in paragraph 4 above.
Armed Forces programme.      Subject to Parliamentary approval:(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government will contribute the unspentbalance of the Templer Grant, estimated at 6.5 millions ($56 millions) on 1st January, 1956,towards the cost of Phase I of the new programme.(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government also agree, subject to agreement on the detailed lists of what is required,to make available equipment, etc. in kind to an estimated value, as given in the Plan, of 5. 5 millions ($47 millions).(c) The Federation have also proposed that certain exist-ing installations of H. M. Forces should be transferredto them.    As details of these items are not yet available, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not in aposition to say whether any of them can be surrenderedwithout requiring re-provisioning by the Federation.It is therefore suggested that further negotiations should be held when the Federation is able to provide more exact details of what is involved.    We shall certainly be ready to give further assistance onthese installations there, but we cannot put a figure to it now.Assistance towards the Emergency7.      Subject to the approval of Parliament, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill make available to the Federation, during the five-year period 1957/61an annual grant of  3 millions (approximately $25.7 millions) towards thecost of the emergency.    This assistance will be provided on the followingunderstandings:(l) that the Federation adheres to a development programmebroadly of the scale and content of that which has been examined in the present financial discussions;(2) that the Federation makes the maximum possible use ofits local resources in meeting the cost of theemergency and of the development programme;(3) that, at the end of the third year of the period, her majesty&apos;s Government and the Federation willjointly review Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs assistance on the emergency in the light of the Federation^financial position and needs at the time, to consider:(a)  a review of the amount to be providedover the whole period, subject to amaximum contribution by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the emergency in theperiod of  20 millions (approximately$171. 5 millions).
Ill(b) a possible conversion to an interest-free loan of all or part of the grantsmade in the first three years.Assistance towards Development Programme8.      The delegation have been told that it would not be possible forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to provide direct Exchequer assistance towardsthe development programme of an independent Commonwealth country.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already agreed to provide theFederation with a grant equivalent to the unspent balance, on independenceday, of their Colonial Development and Welfare allocations.     We standby that undertaking, but beyond that we cannot go in the form of directExchequer assistance towards the development plan.But inasmuch as we shall be contributing towards the emergency,and the building up of the Federations Armed Forces, we shall beenabling the Federation to devote to her development programme asubstantial portion of her own resources which otherwise she would havehad to put into the emergency and the Armed Forces programme.    Inthis way we shall be making a substantial, though indirect, contribution towards her development programme.     The loans of  10 millions whichthe Federation hope to raise on the London Market during the period willbe a very substantial direct contribution from United Kingdom (as opposedto Her Majesty&apos;s Government) resources.summary.      The Federation have asked for total Exchequer aid in one form or another of  97.5 millions.    The aid proposed in the preceding paragraphsis as follows:-  millionsGrant towards the emergency 20. 0 (maximum)Equivalent of Colonial Development and welfare balance (already promised) 4.4Grants to Armed Forces (already promised)Military aid in kindThese figures do not include the proposed London Market loanstotalling  10 millions over the period or any figure for the additional aidin connection with installations mentioned in paragraph 6(c) above since this cannot be estimated at present, though it seems unlikely to exceed  I. 5 millions.
Federations Reactions to United Kingdom Proposals10.    The Delegations reactions to these proposals are set out in annex 2, which consists of a copy of the Chief Minister *s statement madeat a Colonial Office meeting on 7th January.     In summary the delegation were disappointed with Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs offer and felt unableto accept it as it stood.     They proposed to go home without giving a finalanswer and to consider the matter further with the remaining membersof the Expatriate Officers Compensation Scheme who had stayed behind in malaya.     The statement draws attention to commercial and other benefits which the United Kingdom has received and still receives from malaya and emphasises the very important role Malaya plays as a dollarearner.    Moreover, it was in Her Majesty!s Governmenfs interest asmuch as in Malaya&apos;s to end the struggle against Communism and theUnited Kingdom must recognise its responsibility for fighting theemergency.     The statement goes on to suggest a number of additionalconcessions which, if made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, would help towards reaching a settlement of the negotiations satisfactory to bothsides.    These are:-(a) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should waive the conditionof the emergency aid that the grants totalling  9 millions in the first three years (1957/59) might in certaincircumstances be converted retrospectively to interest-free loans;(b) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should increase its cashaid towards the Armed Forces programme by approximately 3. 7 millions so as to equate the total aid under this headwith the Federations request.     (This figure of 3.7 millions includes the possible  1.5 millions mentioned at the end of paragraph 9 above);(c) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should give the Federationa long-term loan (repayment conditions and interest tobe agreed later) of approximately  8.75 millions to pay for the cost of compensation to expatriate officers, about two-thirds of whom are expected to leave within fiveyears of independence;(d) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should waive the repayment of the Federations share of the interest-free War DamageCompensation loans made to the Federation and Singapore.These loans total some  15. 37 millions, repayable overtwenty years from 1st April, 1956, and the Federationsshare is roughly  11.5 millions;(e) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should allow the colonial development Corporation to participate financially,despite independence, in the Malayan IndustrialDevelopment Corporation ( 291,666) and the Land Develop-ment Authority ( 600,000) and to convert its existingloans to the Central Electricity Board from medium to long-term (sum which appears likely to be involved is 2. 93 millions out of total loans of  7. 077 millions).
(f)  that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should allow the colonial development Corporation to invest up to  3 millionsafter independence in the Klang Straits port project,estimated to cost some  3. 5 millions.11.     The Chief Minister&apos;s statement is still being considered by theColonial Office in consultation with the Treasury and the commonwealth relations Office.     Proposed concessions (a) and (b) above are not entirelyunexpected but concessions (c) to (f) are new and of these (c), (d) and (f)all raise particular difficulties.
Statement by the Chief minister mr. Minister of State,My colleagues and I have &quot;been considering over the week-end the proposals which you made on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment at our last meeting on Friday.We are of course very appreciative of the desire ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to help us in the prosecution of theEmergency and the building up of our own regular Armed Forces:but I would not he expressing myself with that candour which isdesirable among friends if I did not add that we aredisappointed both with the amount ef help which is offered andwith certain conditions which are attached to itIn saying this I would assure you that my colleagues andI da not fail to appreciate the etrain imposed on the British economy by y$ur own defence and international commitments.We realise how difficult it is for you to extend this help atthe present time.     But we would ventures  as friends,  to draw attention once more not merely to the vital position.;strategically and politically,  of Malaya in South East Asia,&quot;but also to the large and prosperous economic interests which britain herself has in our country.      That these investmentshave brought great benefit to the country we do not deny, butthey are also a continuing source of wealth and income to britain itself.      Added to this,  we would mention once more that Malaya has long teen,  and remains, an outstanding dollar&apos;earner among all the territories of the Commonwealth and assuch contributes powerfully to the strength of the wholeSterling Area,We must however face the fact that all this - yourinterests and ours. - would be  in jeopardy if we cannot atleast contain, and in due course defeat,  the menace of communism.     Recognising, as we do,  the heavy cost which/already
already falls on the shoulders of the British taxpayer onthis account, we still feel, with conviction?  that it is fairfor us to seek some further assistance in carrying that part which falls on our shoulders.      As I have previously statedand would now repeat:    the Emergency in Malaya is not al*cal war;    it is part of the battle waged &quot;by internationalcommunism against the whole free world;    as such Malayashould not still he called upon9 year after year9 to carryalf?ne the heavy financial burdens which it has imposedher for the past eight years,      F . r this reason we had expected that you would have beer, able to agree t.   give ussover the current five year period one half of the total c*stof the Emergency.      But v/whatever you may feel a??le to offer,,we feel strongly that it should be given as a grant.     Thepresent proposal;, for what I may perhaps calls withoutoffence3 a conditional payment on acc-mnt;,  the nature ofwhich (that is whether it is to be a grant or lean) will bedetermined after three years is we feel an unsatisfactoryarrangement.      Apart from our objections to this proposal inprinciple9  it would also be difficult politically to explainit in Malaya where we fear it will be widely interpreted andcriticised as an attempt by the United Kingdom Governmentto maintain a measure of control over an independent Malaya.A seond practical objection is that it opens up thepossibility of an acrimonious dispute in three years&apos; time between the twn Governments as to whether this help should betreated as a l^an or a grant and if the former,  on what termsit should be repaid.      Such a dispute could well lead to the1 iss of goodwill between the countries instead of that closerharmony and friendship which is the common aim of all of us/around
around this Table.My colleagues and I do not deny the reasonableness of some provision whereby the financial arrangements between our twoGovernments should be subject to periodical review in order todetermine the amount of financial assistance required.      what we weuld argue  is that any such review should only affectfuture financial assistance,  that is the scepe amount and formof the help which Her Majesty&apos;s Government should give Malayafrom the fourth year onwards.      It should not have anyretrospective effect.As tt i-ur Armed Forces,,  we are disappointed that the newadditional assistance which is being offered to us is limited in effect solely to aid in kind.      Faced with our other heavycommitments,, we had expected that in   .ur first few years ofindependences Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have felt ableto cover the full capital cost - loth in cash and kind -- ofthe initial equipment and establishments of our regular armed forces necessary to carry out our obligations under the DefenceTreaty.Lastly may I turn to Development.      Here we can appreciate the difficulties with which our proposals nave presented your government.      I must say? hrwever9  that we think that yourestimates of   *ur resources are likely to prcve too optimisticand your - and indeed our own - estimates of expenditure t**oconservative.      And although for the next year or so our rateof development expenditure may fall below our target figure9  itwill and must be our resolve to raise it rapidly thereafter tosubstantially higher levels than those prevailing today.      and once the immediate problems of transition to Independence areovercomes  I am confident that we shall be able to do so.But if you cannot,  for political or other reasons give usdirect assistance with the Development Plan, then we must attach/even
even greater importance to receiving certain other assurances,Of these the most urgent is that of our future relations withthe Colonial Development Corporation.      Here we wouldparticularly wish to he assured, firstly that Her Majesty&apos;sGrvernment will agree to that Corporation participatingfinancially in the Malayan Industrial Development (Finance)Corporation and the Land Development Authority;    secondly thatthe Corporation will he permitted to refinance its existing1-ans t? the Central Electricity Board (which mature in or about 1960) on the lines already envisaged in discussions between the Government;, the B^ard and the C--rp.*rati* n;    andthirdry that the G rporati .m will be permitted in the future t&apos;extend its investments in these and 1ther existing commitments in Malaya.     Lastly we wiuld particularly ask that the adversedeoisim which we understand ti  have been taken by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment with regard tr- the financing of the North KlangStraits project by the Corporation should fee reviewed in thelight of your inability to give us direct and more generalhelp with the Development Plan.But there are twe other matters of importance whichemerge as a result of your decision not to grant us directhelp with our Development Plan.      I refer now to the cost ofthe Expatriate Officers Compensation Scheme and the repayment of the War Damage Compensation Li--an.     Despite the optimisticestimates made hy your official advisers   f our prospectivecapital resources my colleagues and I seriously apprehend thatwe shall now find great difficulty in meeting these twocommitments in addition t^ the needs of our Development Planitself.      We should therefore wish to ask that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom should be prepared to lend us the necessary funds to meet the requirements of the/Compensation
Compensation Scheme;    this loan to he funded and repaid, with interest over a long and agreed period of years-     As to theWar Damage Compensation Loan I would mention that the majorproportion of this was paid to British interests.      In thestringent financial circumstances with which we are now likelyto he faced, my colleagues and I would now request thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government should consider the waiver of these payments in ord,er to release our limited funds for the activeprosecution of our Development Plan - which (and I hope I mayhe excused from reminding you of this)  it was agreed at theLondon Constitutional Talks was vital to the successful outcome of the struggle against communism in Malaya.We would he grateful, Mr. Minister,  if you and y-urcolleagues will give special consideration t*s all these points.We believe that your decisions on them will greatly influence the final outcome of these discussions and will play animportant part in the determination of future relationsbetween our two Governments and peoples.As far as our formal position is concerned, Mr. Minister,my colleagues and I consider that the proposals which you havemade on &quot;behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government fall so far short of the help which we were charged by our Government to seek,that we could not properly give an answer to them today.      we will therefore take them back to Malaya for full discussionthere with the other members of war Government.      We hope thatin the meantime you will be able to consider and give us afavourable reply on the paints which I have raised this morning.It now cnly remains for me to thank you, Mr. Minister,on behalf of my colleagues and myself - and through you./Her
Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom - for thekindness of your welc me and the generosity of yourhospitality.      Our inability to reach agreement on officiallevels d -es not  I assure yfu5 impair in any way thefriendliness of our pers-nal relations and our pleasantmemories of a white Christmas in England.c.0./207/57
