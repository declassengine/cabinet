0 &apos;   180HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL,CP,(56) 289 COPY NO.19th December. 1956CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have read the papers on local government finance by the Lord privy seal (C. P. (56) 282) and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (56) 287).I can see the attractions to the recipients of making industry pay more in rates, but before we start to divide the spoils we should pause to considerthe wisdom of the action.2.      British industry is already to-day perhaps the most highly taxed in allthe world.     It is living under the threat of still higher taxes next April.It is in immediate danger of considerable dislocation due to fuel shortageand the interruption of vital transport facilities.     It has just had to absorbprice increases of Is. 5d. a gallon on petrol and 6 per cent cn steel.     Itis facing fierce competition in oversea markets.    To tell it, on top of all this, that it is to bear another  25 millions on rates as a first step to afurther  50 millions later will appear an odd sort of Christmas present.It is the equivalent of asking industry to bear a cost increase of25 per cent in railway rates for merchandise, with the prospect of afurther 50 per cent on top of that.3.      To court so much unpopularity with industry for such minimaladvantages to local authorities is surely a policy of doubtful wisdom.    Toswitch so small a part of the vast resources of local authorities fromgrants to rates will, in my judgment, make little difference to localresponsibility.4.      There are arguments in favour of industrial re-rating as part cfa comprehensive re-organisation of the rating system, matched by corresponding tax reductions.     I hope, however, my colleagues will wait for a more convenient moment to contemplate long-term proposals ofthis character.P.T.Board of Trade, S. V/. I.19th December, 1956.
