It makes proposals for home defence expenditure over the next three years based on the home defence policyprovisionally approved by the Policy Review Committee in July last.?-. The Home Defence Committee agree that a total expenditureof about  28 millions in 1 957/58 and about  25 millions in each of thetwo following years is the minimum consistent with the policy provi-provisionally approved by Ministers.    They also approve the proposals madein the attached report for the allocation of those totals among the variousservic es.3. They endorse, however, what is said in the report about thedifficulty of defending a home defence programme which makes no significant provision for the survival of the country in the event of nuclear attack.   They suggest, for the consideration of Ministers, thatit might be easier to justify this programme by reference to general financial and economic conditions than by reference to any revisedappreciation of the risk of global war.SECRETCP.(57) 54th January, 1957CABINET(Signed)   NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.4th January, 1957
DBFENCB EXPENDITURE BY CIVIL DEPARTMENTS.Report by the Official Committee on Civil defence in accordance with the decisions on home defence policyprovisionally reached by Ministers in the Policy review committee on 13th July last (P.R.(56) 6th Meeting, Minute 1)we have prepared proposals for a home defence programme overthe next three years.      Our proposals,  drawn up in accordancewith the policy outlined in H.D.C.(56) 4, paragraph 4. wouldrequire an expenditure of about  28 millions in 1957/53 and about  25 millions in each of the two subsequent years.Annex A shows how this expenditure would be divided betweenthe various elements in the programme,9:encral observations2,    In subsequent paragraphs we call attention, under eachhead, to the implications of reducing expenditure to the levels hoy/ proposed, but we think it right to preface thereport with certain general observations.3.    The present proposals exclude, in accordance with thepolicy provisionally approved by Ministers, further expenditureon measures designed to ensure survival in the event of war,so as to concentrate the limited, funds available on measuresintended to support the deterrent.      The effect of strictlyapplying this doctrine is to limit the programme over thenext throe years - apart from some residue of committedexpenditure - to(a)    development  of the fall-out warning and monitoringsystem, which, apart from its importance nationally, isregarded as an essential adjunct to the operations of bomber and Ficrater Commands;(fo &apos;/ some improvement of the comrauni cat ions network,partly to meet Service Department requirements and partly to strengthen the system as a whole;(c) measures to enable the machinery of government to function at the centre and. to some extent in the regions;(d) maintaining broadly the present level of localcivil defence services;(e) maintaining.-the present emergency port and oildistribution facilities; and(f) maintaining, but at reduced levels, stockpiles offood and medical supplies.
k.    The result of restricting expenditure in this way will hethat for the next three years at least no significant practical measures will he taken to enable the country to survive, let alone recover from, nuclear attack.    Should the likelihood of global war increase, nothing effective could be achievedfor several years in building up the measures needed for survival,,For example,  it would take at least three years to build upeven from present levels the reserve of two million tons of food,previously recognised as the minimum required to prevent famine.The general inadequacy of our preparations will inevitablybecome apparent in the   course of exercises and discussions with the various interests concerned, such as local authorities,public utilities, trade and industry-.    As public awareness ofthis position increases, and fuller understanding of the implications of nuclear weapons is gained, it may well be that public opinion will not support the Government in a policyof relying on the deterrent alone.Detailed observation5*    Civil Defence and Allied Services ( 8.q millions per annum)The provision proposed is the minimum required to keepthe local organisation in being.    It will allow training require--merits to bo met as regards both local facilities and supplies of equipment.    This is essential if the interest both of localauthorities and of volunteers in the Civil Defence Services them-selves is to be maintained.    There is no possibility of a reduction,of expenditure &quot;under this head without facing the political consequences at home and abroad of a stand-down of the localCivil Defence Services.6.    Radine Equipment ( 0.5 millions per annum)Some stockpiling of radiac equipment is essential.In addition to supplies of the special types of traininginstruments, production capacity for the operational typesmust be preserved.    Without the assistance of a stock of radiacinstruments, which cannot be improvised at short notice, plans for attempting to deal With radio-active fall-out would haveno substance.    These instruments are required not only forthe fall-out plotting organization, which would he the source of essential information for the central and regional authorities,of warnings to the public and of information of vital&apos;operationalimpor+ance to Bomber Command, but also for the operationalcivil defence services whicn would be unable to function atall without a minimum supply of instruments.    The members ofthe Civil Defence Services are fully aware of this, and ifstockpiling of radiae equipment were to be abandonee&quot;, theservices could hardly be kept together,7*     1re-Fighting Equipment ( i.5 millions per annum decliningto  0.75 millions; *&quot;       &quot;&quot;There is appreciable committed, expenditure to be metunder this head in the first year.    Apart from this, theprovision now proposed has been drastically reduced to whatis necessary for training only.    This means that no further progress will be made with the long-term plan, previously putforward, to build up stocks    of vehicles and equipment formobilisation purposes.      In particular, the attempt to makeemergency supplies of water available on an operational scalewill have been abandoned.
8.      Machinery of control(a) Central and. regional headquarters ( 0. U million rising to  0,6 million thee declining to  0,5 million per annum) and local headquarters ( 0,05 millionrising to  0.3 million per annum)Expenditure proposed under this head is extremely modestin relation to the size of the requirement.      Sxcept as regardsthe proposed central government headquarters, which should hesubstantially completed towards the end of the period, theprovision proposed would do no more than allow a start to bemade on regional and sub-regional headquarters;    no singleregional headquarters would be completed before i960.      Local- authority control centres are on a rather different footing,since responsibility for their constniction rests with localauthorities, subject to grant under the Civil Defence Act.The different types of control centre, however, whether regionalor local, represent links in a proposed chain of control through which the Government would, both obtain information and iss\ieinstructions.      If local authorities are to be convinced thatthe Government still attach importance to home defence plans,it is important that a modest start should be made next year on the provision of local control centres.(b) Warning and montorlng ( 0.3 million per annum rising to  1 million. )The greater part of this expenditure is designed toprovide for the curly completion of the protection of the LoyalObserver Corps posts to ensure a reliable system for plottingand reporting radio-active fall-out.      The rates of expenditureproposed for this project alloy.- for its completion in 1960/61.In addition to its value in providing information for theGovernment, for purposes of the public warning system, and inthe- development of plans for public control under fall-outconditions, it is the Air Staffs view that this scheme makes a direct and demonstrable contribution to the abilities ofLomber and Fighter Commands to maintain operation in the eventof nuclear attack.      For this reason this particular projecthas boon given greater priority than other elements of theprogramme.9-      Public Utilities(a) &apos;Vator and Sewerage ( 0.3 million per annum)Provision has been limited to a modest purchase of equipment necessary to meet the most urgent demands for therestoration of supply after attack.      This does not, for example,include provision for equipment for the removal of radio-activecontamination from reservoirs in areas affected by fall-out(the cost of which has been estimated at  18 millions);    norfor maintenance of supplies by installing large generators foruse in case of grid failure.      VVithout these measures, thereis no insiuar.ee against a complete breakdown of water supplies in large areas of the  country after a. nuclear attack.(b) Electricity and Gas ( 0.tf1 million in 1957/58 only)Provision is restricted to a token figure for Gas in1957/56 and is intended to meet outstanding commitments.      no provision is made for the supply of spare plant and equipment for the Electricity industry to help maintain the supply ofelectricity through the mains after attack.      Under.
modern conditions there is scarcely any activity that doesnot depend on supplies of electricity,  and without such prer:ro?-ti ns,   communications and in particular the operationof the warning system would be drastically impaired; wirelesscommunication with the public might become impossible; and services requiring electricity for such matters as pumping wouldhave to rely on their own standby generating facilities so faras those existed.(c) Inland Transport ( 0.16 million in 1957/53 decliningto nothing)It is proposed to do no more than to complete work inhand.    This means that the capacity of the railways afterattack will be seriously reduced by the failure to completeworks necessary to ensure continued communication and control.The floodgate scheme for the London tubes will have beencompleted, but further works would be necessary to render thetubes safe for use as public shelters.(d) B.3.C.  ( 0.11 million   per annum)Broadcasting will be a vital, if not the only means ofc-..mnunicat3 on with the public in nuclear war, and it isproposed that provision should be made with the object of enabling tho 3.B.C. to maintain national and civil defenceregional coverage in time of v/ar.    How far these preparationswill be effective, however, will depend in large -measure uponthe electricity supplies maintained after attack (see (b)above) without which mains operated receivers would be unableto function.10,    Importing Services(a) Ports ( 0.5 million per annum)Provision is restricted to that required for maintenance and to complete existing projects. Considerable progress hadbeen made in port emergency planning and provided the present scheme is rounded off an effective contribution could be madein time of war.(b) Shipping ( 0.05 million declining to  0.02 million per annum)Provision de to complete the programme for fittingheavy lift gear in selected merchant ships and to continuethe scheme for the extension of water-tight bulk-heads ir. openshelter deck cargo ships.    These measures have value in peace and in limited war.11 *    Oil. Programme ( 3.5 millions declining to  2.2 millionsper1 annum&quot;)&quot;After completion of major projects now in hand,expenditure on the oil distribution system will be limitedto maintenance and to certain measures such as the provisionof standby pumping plant  and other equipment  and of controlsystems to ensure that tho best use can be made of existing facilities.    Such s restricted programme, which does not provide for accumulating an adequate reserve of oil orsupplementing the present inadequte emergency importing capacitymeans that it would be impossible to meet more than a fraction of the demands for bare survival, or the latest stated re-supplyrequirements of the U.S.jO.F .
12.    Communioat ions    (Capital expenditure financed from loanat an annual rate of  5.5 millions).   The provision under this head covers communications not only for civil defence servicesand government purposes generally, hut also includes considerable.:sums related to active military measures.    Secure communicationsarcs vital to the success of the counter-blow, and it  is not considered that any projects can with safety be eliminated.Expenditure has, therefore, been reduced by slowing down theprogramme to allow for its completion in 1 96I4./65 instead of1962/63 as originally planned.    The Service Departments areprepared to accept the risks inherent in this.13.    Medical Stockpile      ( 0.19 million declining to  0.15million per annum).    Much of the stockpile consists of itemsfor which there would be no ready market.    Regard must also begiven to the difficulties that would be created for theindustries concerned by the sudden release of large government stocks.    It is proposed, therefore, that stocks should be rundown as far us practicable through the hospital and casualtyservices but without any extension of compulsory pea.ce-timecentral supply arrang ements. It is unlikely, however, that therewill be any significant reduction in storage charges.1k.    Food Stockoile    ( h. 70 millions declining to  3.15 millions per annum).&quot;&quot;Oh the provision proposed the food stockpile wouldbe maintained on a sufficient level to feed the country in conditions envisaged after nuclear attack for anout two weeks,with seme further reduction in the years 1953/59 and 1959/60&quot;consequential upon the reduction of the estimate to a figureinsufficient to maintain and turn over the reserve at the levelof April, 1957.    Reserves of this magnitude would, be insufficient to ensure orderly feeding of the population in the periodfollowing attack (there would, of course, be insufficient to ration);    nor could  they be sufficient to bridge the gap untilimports (and home produce) began to flow again in adequatequantities.    There would, therefore, be conditions of famineover progressively wider areas.    It will be impossible to conceal the facts of tne situation from the trade and in duetime, the inadequacy of the reserves will inevitably become more widely known,15.    Research and Development    ( 0.3 million per annum).Provision is made to continue research and development atanout the current level.16.    Industrial Raw Materials.  ( 1.7 millions declining to 1  million per annum).    No provision is made for stocks ofraw materials for a global war.    Provision for maintenanceon a decreasing scale is made to cover (a) stocks which on present aasumptions may be retained for a limited war,and (b)    the residue of other stocks which cannot be liquidatedwithin the period.Co n elusion17.    In the light of this detailed examination of the individual programmes, we consider that expenditure of about  28 millions in 1957/58 and about  23 millions in each of the two following years is the minimum required effectively to sustain the policy outlined in E.D.G.(56) L, paragraph k.    No large-scalereducation of these figures would be possible without a furtherradical change in home defence policy involving the completeelimination of seme elements from the present programme.(Signed) B,St.J.
