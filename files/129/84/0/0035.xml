TOP SECRET Copy NoC.&apos;P.(56)-285i9th December, 1956CABINETNUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Minister of defence on 25th October, 1956, (CM.(56) 74th Conclusions, Minute 6)the Cabinet invited us to consider whether the proposals on limitationof nuclear weapons tests made in C.P.(56) 243 could be revised on thelines which the Cabinet had suggested.    The points made were:-(a) if tests were to continue indefinitely, subject only to a maximum limit of fission yield of15 megatons, radio-active fall-out would havereached dangerous proportions within thenext generation;(b) a maximum limit in the region of 12 megatonsa year would be more satisfactory;(c) as there seemed little need for the UnitedKingdom to seek exact parity in this matter with the United States and the Soviet union the proportions of 4:4:3 might offer the prospectof an agreement on a total of 11 megatons a year.2. The world total figure of 15 megatons a year was neverintended as a figure for indefinite continuation.    Rather it was a holding figure for the next few years, intended to provide an entry to international agreement on limitation, which would on the one hand notbe so stringent as to have no chances of acceptance on the ground thatit interfered with essential development programmes and on the otherwould be low enough to ensure, even with the present lack of accurateknowledge of the behaviour of strontium 90 in the atmosphere, that a dangerous level would not be reached in the near future.     It seems to usmore important to get the principle of international agreement accepted and the initial step taken than to propose, with the risk of indefinitediscussion and delay, a figure which might be, but could not be guaranteed to bes safe for an indefinite period.3. With regard to the ratio of total fission yield between thethree nuclear powers, account must be taken of the relative stages ofdevelopment.    It is clear from recent American statements that they arenow able to manufacture megaton weapons with a very much smaller proportion of fission energy to fusion energy than was the case in their earlier series of trials and is the case at the moment with ourselves and the Russians.    The consequence of this is that a particular figure for fission yield would allow to America a much greater number of testexplosions within the total fission yield permitted to them than it would-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........................... 1
do certainly to ourselves and perhaps to Russia.    The converse of thisis that in our early stage of development of megaton weapons we havea more real need for a high figure of fission yield than have the americans.4. We believe therefore that it would be unwise to enter into discussions with the Americans on the basis of willingness by theUnited Kingdom to accept from the start a lower total of fission yieldthan is allowed to the Americans or the Russians.    It is conceivable that in the course of discussion with the Americans we may find itdesirable to consider accepting a smaller total for ourselves, althoughalthough it might v/ell be undesirable for us to accept openly an inferiorposition to the Russians;  on the other hand we could hardly expect theRussians to accept a lower figure than was accorded to the Americans.5. On 7th December, in the course of Anglo/United Statesdiscussions in Washington on the latest American disarmament proposalsMr. Stassen was anxious to learn our latest ideas on limitation, whichhe hoped to have an early opportunity to discuss.     He had previouslyexpressed the strongest misgivings about any limitation of tests inadvance of a ban cn the production of fissile materials   for use in weaponIn view of this, we consider that the prospects of securing american agreement to our proposals cannot be rated very high.6. Nevertheless, since the Americans are clearly expectingan initiative from our side, we recommend that discussions shouldbe initiated with them on the basis of a total of 1 5 megatons of fissionyield per annum for the three Powers divided equally between themand that this should be represented only as a figure intended to cover the next few years in order to enable agreement to be reached on theprinciple of and the first step in the limitation of tests.tA.H.18th December, 1956.
