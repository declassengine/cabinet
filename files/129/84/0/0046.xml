C.P.(57) 65th January,1957CABINET&quot;THE GRAND DESIGN&quot;(CO-OPERATION WITH WESTERN EUROPE)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBackgroundTwo great Powers, America and Russia, now immeasurably out-strip all the others.2.      In 1914 great Powers were comparatively numerous.     Nor was there the present gulf between great Powers and other Powers.     Whenthe chief armament of war was the rifle, the machine-gun and the field-gun, Serbia could fight Austria and Turkey hold her own with Britain.3.      Twenty years later, in 1939, no Power of much less than50 millions, backed by a well-developed industrial system, could make effective war.     Neither Italy nor France, still less Yugoslavia orTurkey, qualified.    The only effective combatants were America, Russia,Britain, Germany and Japan.4.      By 1957 the process has gone further;   and it will go further yet.An industrialised country with 50 million inhabitants is no longer large enough or powerful enough to produce and man the weapons required formodern war, nuclear or conventional.    A country which wishes to playthe role of a great Power must not only possess certain conventional forces.     It must also make and have the power to use the whole range of thermo-nuctear weapons, including the megaton bomb.    Although, if all goes well, Britain will shortly have the know-how of the megaton bomband the possession of some kiloton weapons, Britain cannot by herself gothe whole distance.     If we try to do so we shall bankrupt ourselves.The choice is therefore clear.     We must stop short with an insufficientstockpile and inadequate means of delivery or we must seek to achieveour end by other means.PART IA Western European Military and Political Association5.      If we are to be a first-class Power with full thermo-nuclearcapacity, it can only be done in association with other countries.     Britainand the other six Western European Union (W.E.U.) Powers have a combined population of over 210 millions, together with very considerableThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...^.....
I i uindustrial capacity, resources and skill.    If these were pooled, the resultant association could afford to possess full thermo-nuclear capacity.Tt could be the third great Power.6.      Such an association would not be a &quot;Third Force&quot; between Americaand Russia^    Its object would rather be to develop into one powerful groupwithin the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), almost aspowerful as America and perhaps in friendly rivalry with her.     The highpolitical and strategic direction would remain in N.A.T.O. as long as the americans remained there.7.      The most important step in the development of the western european association on these lines would be a joint research anddevelopment programme for atomic and thermo-nuclear weapons, including all the means of delivery.    There would also have to be arrangements forthe common financing of this programme, for integrated production andfor the use in the joint interest of the end-products. 18.      This military association of the seven Powers would in practiceentail a closer political association between them.     Once the association had thermo-nuclear capacity, it would have to have the machinery for deciding about the use of that capacity.    There need be no supranationalmachinery not responsible to Governments.   Nor need we ever come to acomplete merging of forces.     The machinery of W.E.U. could serve,developed in due course as was necessary for closer co-operation bothin the nuclear and conventional fields.Advantages and Disadvantages of the above9.      In making proposals on the above lines to our European allies, weshould be offering them a great  deal.     In thermo-nuclear matters, weare vastly ahead of them in knowledge, manufacturing capacity, testingfacilities, etc.    Therefore we should be in a strong position to see thatthe arrangements were made on our terms.10.     The political advantages would be solid.    Germany, Italy,Benelux and probably the present French Government would welcome theproposal.     They have always wanted us to &quot;go into Europe&quot;.     We should do much to correct French and German tendencies to neutralism.     Inparticular, we would bind Germany more tightly into the Western familyat a time when such binding is vital.    We might win next summer&apos;selection for Dr. Adenauer.     The arrangements could be made to fit in with our plans for force reductions.     We should facilitate the financial arrangements for maintaining our forces on the Continent and for continuing our research and development programme.11.        It would be logical to accompany the military arrangements by arrangements for civil nuclear co-operation;   and we should have to reconsider our relationship with EUR ATOM.     The result might be tomodify the present views of the other six Powers about EURATOM.12.       As part ox a larger confederation we could hope to makeWestern European influence stronger, e.g. in Africa and the Middle East.While we should not set up as rivals to America, we should neverthelessattain to some degree of reinsurance against an eventual American with-drawal from Europe, either partial or total.     We should take our place
where we now most belong, i. e, in Europe with our immediate neighbours,and thereby give greater cohesion and strength to Europe.    Nor needthese arrangements lead to any weakening of Commonwealth ties.Finally, the financial contributions of our W. E. U. partners would help usconsiderably with our balance of payments,13.       There are, however, grave risks unless our proposals are handledright.    We should risk our special arrangements with America and canada, particularly in the nuclear and intelligence fields.14.       The close relationship between the three Anglo-Saxon Powersis based on mutual confidence.    Unless we retain the present links insubstantially their present form, the production of thermo-nuclear weapons, etc. might be delayed for years owing to the change in thesystem, and the need for the necessary planningj construction and trainingof scientists in conjunction with Our new associates.15.       Our nuclear arrangements with America are governed by twoagreements, covering the military and civil fields respectively andrepresenting actual and potential benefits which would be a most serious loss.     We should have to proceed circumspectly with the Americans.But we are not without bargaining counters.     The Anglo-american agreement of 15th June, 1955, for military co-operation can only be terminated by the mutual agreement of both Parties.     It forbids either government to communicate information made available to it under theAgreement to third parties without the consent of the originator.     But itdoes contain a provision that &quot;nothing herein shall be interpreted oroperate as a bar or restriction to consultation and co-operation by theUnited Kingdom or the United States with other nations or regional organisations in any fields of defence&quot;.16.       The first and most difficult problem with the Americans willbe that of security.    They are sensitive about this, as Mr. Charles Wilson&apos;remarks in the N.A.T.O. meeting in Paris showed.    German and Frenchsecurity is bad; it would have to be improved and this would take time.Meanwhile, we should have to make it clear to our European allies that,unless we were to risk losing American co-operation, they might have toleave to us in the United Kingdom responsibility for certain parts of thethermo-nuclear programme, at any rate in the initial stages.    Inreverse, this progress could be used as a bargaining counter with the americans.     But arrangements of this kind, might only be a temporaryphase.     What would be in question would be security vis-a-vis Russia.Russia would in any case be technically well in advance of western europe, at any rate at the beginning.    In any case if, as the Americanssay, it will not be many years before almost every country has thepossibility of thermo-nuclear weapons, then security becomes ofdiminishing importance.17.       To sum up, the choices are either:-(a) to go on alone by ourselves at the riskof bankruptcy;   or(b) to stop short at a point where we wouldbe a nuclear Power only in name;   or(c) to pool research and development and theend-products along the above lines.
18.       1 prefer the last choice.     We should thereby enlist not only theresources and skill of our European neighbours, particularly the Germans,but also their finance.     If we had to pay, say, 25 per cent of the cost, our economic burden would be enormously lightened;   and we should in due course free a large number of scientific personnel who are urgently required elsewhere than in the field of defence.19. On the other hand, it must be realised that this choice wouldinvolve the risk of a hostile Soviet reaction, and the weakening of ourlinks with America.20.      The possibility of Dr. Adenauer losing the next election need not affect our choice because that would occur at so early a stage in our programme.21.       The negotiations would be complicated but there is a favourableatmosphere in Europe at present.PART other Elements in the &quot;Grand Design&quot;22.       Unless W. E. U. co-operates on this nuclear basis I do not think there is much scope for co-operation between the W.E.U. Powers except on normal N.A.T.O. lines.     That, however, does not mean that there areno other fields in which we can draw closer to Europe.23.      In Paris when I sketched out at the North Atlantic Council inDecember this idea of a &quot;Grand Design&quot; for the rationalisation of theproliferation of the Atlantic and European organisations, I covered alsothe economic and Parliamentary aspects.Economic24.      In the economic field the idea, very briefly, is to continue to look to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)as the main instrument for co-operative effort and to try to consolidateunder its aegis the other European economic organisations.    The Six-Power communities need not be dissolved but the association of other european States with those communities should be effected within theframe-work of the O.E.E.C.    Thus the machinery required to regulate the European Free Trade Area should be set up as part of the O.E.E.C.Par liara e nt a r y25.      Another element in the Grand Design might be a General Assemblyfor Europe which would replace the separate assemblies which have beenor are liable to be set up for each organisation, e. g. Council of Europe,W. E. U. , EURATOM, N.A.T.O.    This General Assembly could divide its work as is done in the United Nations Assembly between Committees,each discussing a different category of subjects, e. g. -(a)    First Committee (Political) - to holdgeneral debates;
(b) Second Committee (Economic) - to discussproblems of European economic co-operation and the activities of O.E.E.C.;(c) Third Committee (Social and Cultural) -to carry on the work already done in this field by the Council of Europe andW.E.U. Assemblies;(d) Fourth Committee (Defence) - to discussproblems of European defence, includingthe W.E.U. Arms Control activities.26.       Thus we might get away from the competition and overlappingbetween the existing assemblies and establish instead one centre,serviced by one Secretariat where Parliamentarians of the Westernnations could meet to discuss any aspect of Western co-operation.When subject of discussion was defence, certain countries, e.g. sweden and Switzerland, would probably not wish to be present but for the restthe wider the attendance the better and I would hope that American and canadian Parliamentarians would participate on the strength of their membership of N.A.T.O. and their associate membership of O.E.E.C.27.      Arrangements on these lines would permit the neutral european countries and even eventually the Eastern European States to participate in economic and Parliamentary institutions without having to joinN.A.T.O. or W.E. U.PART IIIProcedure28.       If the foregoing is generally agreed, the procedure might be asfollows :-(i)     I would float these ideas, in confidence and in general terms,with M. Spaak when he comes to London on Sunday, 13th January.     Iwould then discuss them with the Italians, Germans and French (leaving it to M. Spaak to inform his Benelux colleagues).    I would propose to visit Bonn and Paris this month on my way to or from Rome.     If allwent well, a meeting of the W. E. U. Foreign Ministers would then berequired, perhaps at the end of January;  this to be followed by a working party of officials to work out the details.(ii)      The timing of the approach to the Americans and Canadians isimportant.     It might be in two stages:-(a)    Just before I talk to M. Spaak on 13th January, the americans and Canadians would be told that wewere exploring the possibilities of the UnitedKingdom drawing closer to Europe over and aboveour plan for a Free Trade Area.     It is forconsideration whether we should also explain tothem that we were becoming ever more conscious of the weight of our defence programme and thatwe were exploring the possibilities of relievingourselves possibly by some sharing with our
W.E.U, allies of the burden of our research anddevelopment.     The Americans and Canadians would &quot;likewise be told of our general thinking on the linesof Fart II of this paper in amplification of myremarks at the N.A.T.O. meeting in Paris aboutthe &quot;Grand Design&quot;.(b)   Immediately after my talks in Rome, Bonn and Paris,and before the meeting Of W. E. U. Foreign Ministers,our scheme (possibly modified by my talks in Rome,Bonn, etc. ) would be laid before the American and canadian Governments who would be informed thatwe proposed to raise it at the W. E. U, Ministerialm e et ing.29.      We should at all stages emphasize to the Americans and the canadians that our ideas were within the ambit of the Atlantic Alliance anddesigned to strengthen it.    We should also make it clear that we relied on their encouragement and regarded their continued co-operation as essential.S.JL.foreign Office, S. W. I.4th January, 1957.
