oC.P.(56) 270 COPY NO. *1st December, 1956CABINETOIL prices note by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a paper on oilprices which has been prepared by officials of the Ministry of Fuel and power.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W. I.30th November, 1956.
OIL   prices note BY THE MINISTRY OF FUEL AND power. Substantial increases in oil prices are now inevitable andthere are strong arguments for immediate action,     Although there is&quot;no statutory control the power to impose one has been taken by the defence regulations (No.J) Order 1956.      In present conditions it would be im-possible for the Government to disclaim all responsibility for increases in prices and the Minister of Fuel and Power has informed the House thatthe oil companies have agreed to consult him before raising prices inthe United Kingdom.2. Such consultations have been taking place during the past week and have now reached the point of definition.     The internationalsupplying companies are incurring very heavy extra costs which fall into three main categories -(a) Transit round the Cape, as against transit through theMediterranean.(b) Tan ker Rates.     Market rates have risen sharply.      (the incidence of extra costs has varied as between companies,but Esso in particular have felt obliged to charter sub-stantial tonnage at current rates).(c) Abnormal purchases of oil.     The limited Western Hemispheresupplies have been taken up by the companies even though theindividual transactions would normally have been regardedas uneconomic.These costs, separately assessed by U.K.. and American Companies,are in total of the order of 2^-d. per gallon and the supplying companies are in the process of increasing their charges to their distributingagencies and affiliates throughout Europe accordingly.The distributing companies are involved in further extra costsby reason of the reduced quantities distributed and the increased incidence of split loads and small individual deliveries.     These costs are heavierin relation to motor spirit than other products.3. The extra costs claimed by the four main distributors are shownin Annex 1;    the higher costs of Mobil are understandable since their business in main products is relatively small and their refinery is closely linked to the production of lubricating cils.      In their efforts to secureall the U.S. oil available Esso have had to incur quite exceptional charges for tanker tonnage which must be recognised but need not be taken asimmediately recoverable in full.      It is proposed therefore that we should raise no objection to price increases not exceeding those shown in thefollowing table:-
4* Urgency arises for the following reasons.     The extra costs incurred are very large and the companies cannot reasonably be expected tocarry them for any length of time.     It is desirable moreover that thereshould be no discouragement to the recovery of such costs by U.K. companiesfrom their European customers.     Furthermore if we were to try to hold downprices there is a danger that some of the oil would go elsewhere and difficulties would arise in particular with the companies of Americanparentage,.     Incidentally these companies have indicated that they would accept the limits proposed in the previous paragraph even though theyfall short of their requests.     Equally pressing are the present petroldistribution difficulties which are at; least partly caused by dealersholding on to stocks in anticipation of&quot; a price rise,,      The sooner theair is cleared the sooner will distribution through the garages settle down,,5p Seme addition to retail margins is also necessary.     Petrolsales are the main source of income for thousands of small garage ownerswho considerably outnumber the multiple filling stations.     A reductionof at least 25$ of their turnover is insupportable because their overhead,charges are not susceptible to temporary reduction and their labour costs are only marginally reduced.     After examination of the position,in consultation with the Motor Agents&apos; Association, we are satisfied thatan emergency surcharge of igd. per gallon on retail sales of motor spirit and Derv fuel would be justifiable.6. Responsibility for announcing these increases will rest onthe oil companies who may wish to say that they had consulted the Minister.In any case the Minister would have to make it clear if questioned in theHouse or elsewhere that he had agreed to these emergency surcharges.7. For convenience the full effect of the proposals, wholesale and retail, is shown in Annex 2.     The effect (direct and. indirect) on the retail price index is about one half of one per cent.Ministry of Fuel and Power,S. W. 1.30th November. 1956.DERV 3d.Fuel Oil 3d.All others 3d.These increases would be regarded as a surcharge specificto the Suez emergency to make it clear that they are not intendedto raise the level of oil prices permanently.Present prices would thus become &quot;basic&quot; except that we propose to agree to the addition to the basic price of fuel oil of -g-d.per gallon which would have been in any event justified by reference to world market prices..     Unfortunately fuel oil procurement is particularly difficult and it may be halpful if this is reflected in the price.
