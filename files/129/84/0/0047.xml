(XvC2^AoJU*i &apos;.     7.1-57SECRETCP.(57) 77th January,1957COPY NO.&apos;&quot;-&apos;&quot;^&apos;cabinet home defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs in the report attached to CP. (57) 5 officials make proposals for expenditure on home defence preparations.     The report sets out clearly(see paragraph 4 in particular) the risks taken irt excluding from our home defence programme for the next three years at least any significantpractical measures to enable the country to survive let alone recover from nuclear attack.     It will be seen from paragraph 3 of the cover note to CP. (57) 5 that this view is endorsed by the Heads of civil Depart-ments and by the representatives of the Chiefs of Staff who constitute the Home Defence Committee.     I share their concern, since thepreparation of the much reduced home defence programme on the linesnow submitted for consideration has been governed by assessment thatthe risk of global war had receded, and I feel considerable doubt how far this assessment will in present circumstances be regarded as acceptableby Parliament, and in particular by local authorities and the informedpublic on whose co-operation the continuance of civil defence on itspresent basis must depend.     Certainly we cannot expect it to gounchallenged, particularly in the light of statements such as that reportedto have been made to the recent meeting of the Atlantic Council byGeneral Johnson, the American member of the Standing Group, to theeffect that &quot;the risk of a general war by miscalculation had been increased by recent events&quot;.2.      In putting forward a programme involving a considerable reduction on last year&apos;s original home defence estimates we risk the widespreadconclusion that the real reason for the reduction is not so much the reduced risk of war as a Government decision that civil defence prepara-tions are of little value in relation to the type of attack that might haveto be faced, and if this view gains credence we shall find it impossible tokeep in being the home defence measures whose absence would, in thewords of the memorandum by the former Minister of Defence on which thecurrent review has been based, &quot;be liable to undermine the deterrent&quot;.These include the maintenance of the local ciril defence services.     Itis worth recalling that in 1954, immediately after the announcement by theUnited States authorities of the scale of destruction of the hydrogen bomb,there was widespread defeatism, and it was touch and go how far the example of Coventry would be followed by other authorities up and down the country.     For the time being the position was rectified by the firmaction taken in the case of Coventry, but in the longer run similar difficulties have been avoided only by the constructive measures announced in the Defence White Papers of 1955 and 1956 and the acceptance of-1-
reiterated assurances that the Government was still convinced of the valueof civil defence and determined to see an effective system establishedwithin the limits of what was practicable financially.     It is howeverbecoming increasingly difficult to hold, the position and there have beensigns of discouragement amongst those concerned with civil defence.3.      It is now clearly too late to contemplate any significant increasein the proposed financial provision for next year but the way in which the reductions are presented is likely to be of major importance as regardsthe future of civil defence in the United Kingdom, and t hope that mycolleagues will be prepared to accept the recommendation by officialsthat the reduced expenditure next year should be justified &quot;by referenceto general financial and economic conditions&quot; rather than &quot;by referenceto any revised appreciation of the risk of global war&quot;.    At the same time it seems to me essential that the opportunity should be taken in the white paper to state the Governments conviction that a strong civil defence organisation is an essential part of the deterrent.     I would strongly urge that the time has come when the whole question of the role of civil defence in relation to defence should be reviewed so that a proper balanceshould be maintained between the several aspects of the defence programme.G.LL.-G.Home Office, S. W. 1.5th January, 1957.
