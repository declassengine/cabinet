TARIFF POLICY:   MEATNote by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food on 3rd October the Cabinet approved proposals for theopening of negotiations with Australia and New Zealand for a preferentialtariff on meat.     (CM.(56) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.        It has since become clear that New Zealand is not anxious orready to discuss meat at present, and that there might be advantage tous in deferring- an offer of a preferential tariff until the New zealand government, who appear to be recognising that they have little hope ofsecuring quantitative restriction of Argentine meat imports, have had more time to convince their farmers.3.        These considerations are reinforced by the desirability of holding the meat negotiations quite separately and at a different time from those at present being conducted with the Australians for a newTrade Agreement.    To embark on meat discussions now would be ofno help to the general negotiations and would simply delay a general settlement, without any positive advantage.4.        For these reasons I have agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Commonwealth Secretary and the President of theBoard of Trade that the tariff negotiations should be postponed.In view of the representations we have received from our own farmersI would propose that this postponement should not be too long and thatwe should aim at opening talks early in the New Year.COPY NO.CABINETD.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,S.W.1. ,30th October, 1956.SECRETCP.(56) 25330th October, 1 9,56,.
