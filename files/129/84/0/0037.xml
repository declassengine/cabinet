LOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in his memorandum (CP0(56) 282) the Lord Privy Seal indicatesthe outcome of the review of local government finance and invites usto come to certain conclusions.    I agree that early decisions arerequired and I sympathise with the principles which underlie theLord Privy Sealfs proposals.     But I see considerable practical difficulty about some of them, especially at present;   and I hope that my colleagues will find it of assistance if I draw attention to my doubts about re-rating and the general grant.Re-rating2.      The proposal is that initially industry and freight transport shouldbe re-rated up to 50 per cent in 1958 or 1959, with the prospect of complete re-rating later.    This would initially double the rate burden on industry and transport and produce an additional rate income of about 25 millions.    The net addition to industrial and freight transport costs would be less than this, becausethe extra rates would relieveindustry of some of its present tax liability.     The residual burden would not in many cases be insupportahle;   it would directly affectmost significantly the less prosperous and marginal industries ofwhich Scotland has more than its share.3.      I am not opposed to re-rating in principle.    But I am not sure that the present moment, when industry is facing great difficulties anduncertainties, and when the need to stimulate production and exports is vital, is the best one to announce it.    Industry can hardly be expectedto welcome re-rating or to be encouraged to fresh efforts by theprospect of it.    Further, such a limited measure as is proposedinitially will not satisfy the local authorities.     What they want - inScotland at any rate - is. the complete re--rating of both industry and agriculture or a grant in lieu.Adjustment of grants on re-rating4.      But I feel sure that if we do re-rate it is quite unrealistic to propose that we should, by adjusting grants deprive local authorities of four-fifths of the benefit, as is apparently contemplated.    The broadargument for doing this is that the Government are meeting too big ashare of the cost of local government, and that if more has to be met from rates local authorities will behave more responsibly and the rate-payers will take a greater interest in local affairs.COPY NO.confidential.P.(56) 2871 Sth Dec ernb e r,, 1 95 6.CABINET
In theory this should be so;  but in practice I think bothpropositions highly doubtful.    It certainly has not been my experiencethat the local authorities who get least grant at present are the mostresponsible;   and I do not believe that the lack of interest in localgovernment will be corrected by making ratepayers pay a little more,5.      But however this may be, I think there is no doubt at allthat the local authorities will strenuously resist any proposal that most of the benefit of re-rating should be taken from them.     Evenif the rate burden has not qrown in the aggregate as much as the taxburden the level of rates,, at least in Scotland, is now such that doubtsare being felt about the possibility of continuing to base local taxation on the value of property.   The problem is psychological as well as financial;   rates of well over  1 in the   1 do not seem tolerable tothe ordinary ratepayer.     If local authorities retain the revenue fromre-rating, with only such grant reductions as follow automatically,the local burden will be eased.    Every ratepayer will benefit,and see the benefit.    If the revenue is transferred to the exchequer the taxpayer, who is the same person as the ratepayer, may benefit in theory but certainly will not notice it.     Further, the industrialistcan hardly be expected to understand why he should pay more rates to the local authority for the benefit of the Exchequer and he is unlikely to be encouraged by so doing to take the closer interest in local government which it is one of the objects of re-rating to create.General Grant6.      Kere again, the principle of giving local authorities moreindependence is admirable and in accordance with our professedintentions.    But I have the gravest doubts whether in practice thescheme would do any good.    As I understand it, the proposal means that there would be not one but three types of grant.     Some of thepresent ad hoc grants - e.g. housing, v/ater and drainage, roads,police, probation and remand homes - would remain.     Others -education and a group of smaller grants (health, firea child care, town planning, road safety, traffic patrols, registration and physical training)would be abolished and replaced by a new general grant based onfactors selected as measures of need.     Thirdly^ the equalisation grant,which is based on needs differently assessed, would continue to bepaid as at present.7.      I am not opposed in principle to a general grant.    But very many people will be;   and we ought to be very sure of the case for it before v/e propose it.    I do not think the case is made out.Essentially it is that such a grant would give local authorities morefreedom and a higher sense of responsibility,    This seems to me toproceed on two fundamentally false premises.    The suggestion that local authorities are subject to repeated instructions from the central departments on irritating points of detail, and that atrophied localgovernment has degenerated into little more than an agent of thecentral government is not, in my experience, supported by the facts.In my view it would be a fairer representation of the case to say thatwe have established a partnership with local authorities which on thewhole works well.   Secondly, the degree of freedom which the general grant would secure can be much exaggerated.   A great deal of therevenue expenditure met from the grants involved is fixed by national agreements or Ministerial regulation.   This would continue.   Capital-2-

I j iexpenditure would continue to be controlled.   And it is recognised -though it is not clear how this would b-? done - that new controls at &apos;keypoints1 would have to be introduced.   As regards the effect on the localauthorities&apos; sense of responsibility, I see some danger chat initiativemight be discouraged by a grant related not to local achievement but toweighted population.8.        Against any gains of this kind, however, must be set the factthat without specific grants the influence which the central Departmentscan exercise on the development of a service - both in restrainingunnecessary expenditure, which in some areas is important, and in encouraging better standards in backward areas - will be gravelyimpaired.   The meaner local authorities will tend to be even more parsi-monious; the more extravagant ones will be more free to indulge theirfavourite projects.   To allow local authorities to switch Exchequer money from one service to another is no solution.   The major service affected iseducation, and I have no doubt that our influence on that service, especially at present, ought not to be reduced as it would be by the introduction of ageneral grant.   In varying degrees precisely the same considerations apply to the other services concerned.9.        Finally, I do not think we should proceed with the proposal to re-organise grants without a clearer idea than we have been able to form as yet of how the gains and losses of individual local authorities would be matched.   Self-financing transitional arrangements are contemplated,but I am by no means clear how they could be the answer to the violentchanges (ranging from 25 per cent loss of grant to 39 per cent gain)v/hich I am told would reuult in Scotland.J SScottish Office, S.W.I.17th December, 1956
