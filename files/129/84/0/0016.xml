confidential cp.(56) 26617th November, 1956.CABINETAGRICULTURAL policy memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodA comprehensive settlement for the proposed alterationsto the agricultural guarantee structure and the introduction of the farm Improvement Scheme, on the lines approved by the Cabinet(CM.(56) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 7), has now been agreed withthe representatives of the three Farmers&apos; Unions for England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.2.        The new arrangements are explained in the attached draft White Paper.    The agreement reached in regard to specialreviews is recorded in paragraph 20 and was acceptable to theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour as well asto the Agricultural Ministers.    This arrangement would haveeliminated all but one of the special reviews granted to date andwould have considerably reduced the cost of that one.3.        I think the settlement should have the general effectthat we intended particularly as it has been agreed on behalf ofthe Farmers&apos; Unions.     I am obtaining their agreement in writing.4. I seek authority to make a statement in Parliament and topresent the White Paper on Monday, 26th November.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,S.W.1.16th November, 1956.COPY NO.
WHITE PAPERLONG-TERM ASSURANCES FOR AGRICULTUREIntroduction1.     The Government undertook in the White Paper on the Annual Review and determination of Guarantees, 1956,   (Cmd. 9721, paragraph 36) to consider whether any practicable means could be devised of providing more effective long-term assurances of support for the agricultural industry, so as to help it in itsforward planning.     The possibilities have now been examined by the Governmentin consultation with representatives of the three Farmers&apos; Unions of England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.2,      The questions considered have been the following:(i)    Should any changes be made in the existing provision for annual reviews of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry,for the determination of changes in price guarantees and. production grants in the light of such reviews,  and for special reviews in betweenannual reviews?(ii)    Could minimum assurances be given on the individual commodities,  designedto enable producers to plan ahead, that would be more effective thanthose at present provided for under Section 5 Qf &quot;the Agriculture Act,1947?(iii)    Could there be, in addition, a new form of assurance that would givea minimum guarantee each year which would be related to the total ofthe guarantees for the industry?(iv)    What more could be done to assist the industry in improving itscompetitive position and to help towards a progressive reductionin the need for Exchequer support?3.      In addition, the Farmers&apos; Unions have put forward their views on a numberof other matters concerning the future of the industry,  including investmentneeds, credit and related matters,  import policy,  education, research and advisoryservices, and facilities in remote areas.     A number of the&apos; issues raised arc wide-ranging and some of them relate to established policy affecting many aspects of thenational economy.      The Government recognise, however, the importance which theagricultural industry attaches to these subjects and will continue to consult fully
0 kiwith representatives of the industry in further detailed examination of the viewsthey have put forward.Annual Reviews4.      One of the main criticisms of the present arrangements has been that annual reviews make for uncertainty.     a major consideration has, therefore, been tosee whether it would be possible to avoid the holding of reviews annually,  or alternatively whether the procedure for determining fresh price guarantees couldbe made more automatic and the outcome therefore more predictable.     After a thorough examination of the possibilities, the Government and the Farmers&apos; unions have concluded that this is not practicable.      They are agreed that, on thecontrary, any satisfactory arrangements must provide for account to be taken ofmany changing factors before determinations can be made that are fair both tothe industry and to the nation.      The most important of such factors are productiontrends in relation to consumption requirements, the trend of the industry&apos;s net income, Exchequer liability, cost changes, world market prospects, and increasing efficiency.     Not only do these factors themselves vary from year to year, but their relative importance may also vary.      The possibility of adjusting guaranteed prices in accordance with a formula which provided for these variable factors hasbeen carefully examined.      But no formula can meet the need satisfactorily.     Thefundamental dilemma in trying to construct a formula for this purpose is that, ifit takes account of the many relevant factors, it becomes too complex to be readilyunderstood or to be operated satisfactorily:    if it is simple, it can relate to only one or two factors and will prove to be inadequate and too imprecise inoperation.      Furthermore,  some of the factors, such as those relating to the market,cannot be put into figures;    and even where figures are available they are not sufficiently firm to stand up to the strain of use in a formula which would determine directly the precise level of the guarantees.      The conclusion, which theGovernment share with the farmers&apos; representatives,  is that annual reviews must beretained broadly on present lines and that the provision of long-term assurancesmust be sought through minimum guarantees rather than by any attempt to determineguaranteed prices for a period of time ahead.
5.   - The Government have accordingly proposed   the following comprehensive arrangements.     These have been worked out after joint consultation with the farmers&apos;representatives who welcome them as a sound and satisfactory basis for futureconfidence and the necessary forward planning in the industry.(i)   The annual review determinations to continue broadly on present lines,subject to the new proposals described in (ii) - (iv) below,(ii)   An undertaking to maintain the guaranteed price (adjusted for any changein the basis of the guarantee) for each commodity each year at not lessthan 96 per cent of the guaranteed price for the previous year, with inthe case of livestock and livestock products an additional provision that, in any period of three years, reductions in the guaranteed price for a particular commodity will not together exceed 9 per cent.(Paragraphs 1 - 11).(iii)    An undertaking to maintain each year the total value of the guarantees,including production grants, (together estimated to be of the order of 1,150 millions at present) at not less than the amount resulting from taking 91&apos;k per cent of the total value of the guarantees in the pi-ecedinyear and adding cost increases or subtracting cost decreases that have occurred on review commodities since the last annual review.(Paragraphs 12 - 16).(iv)    Crop guarantees to be determined after each annual review for the immediately succeeding harvest,  instead of for the harvest of thefollowing year, so as more rapidly to reflect changes in costs and other circumstances.      (Paragraph 11).(v)    Provision to continue to be made for special reviews but the holding of such reviews to be subject to new arrangements that have beenagreed between the Government and the Farmers&apos; Unions.      (Paragraphs19 and 20).(vi)    To help the industry to increase its working efficiency, a major new scheme of grants for assisting the provision of permanentfixed equipment on farms and the making of long-term improvements to land.      These grants will be at the rate of 33&quot;g per cent,  and theadditional cost to the Exchequer, beyond that on other grants and subsidies, might amount to some  50 millions over a ten-year period.(Paragraphs 21  - 29).
6.     These new arrangements and the reasons for them are explained in thefollowing paragraphs.Commodity Guarantees7.      To enable the industry to plan ahead, Section 5 of the Agriculture Act,1947, provides for the fixing of crop price guarantees at each annual review for the harvest of the following year, and for the fixing of minimum prices for livestock and livestock products every other year for a period of twoyears at a time three to four years ahead.     In practice the minimum pricesdetermined under this Section have not proved as effective as was intended.This is because there has been no mechanism for taking account of changes in circumstances, particularly cost increases, occurring between the determina-tion of the minimum prices and the time at which they become operative.     Thepossibility of continuing this general system but of bringing the minimum prices up-to-date by the use of a formula, related for instance to costchanges, has been examined.     Account could not be taken, however, through a formula, of other factors besides costs that would need to be considered,such as increasing efficiency, market requirements and Exchequer liability.Moreover, to operate a formula related to production costs for individual commodities would put too much reliance on the accuracy and continuity of the statistical data.8,     A   new form of   assurance   has therefore been devised which will be more effective in keeping the minimum guarantees up-to-date.     This will be anundertaking that the guaranteed price (adjusted for any change in the basisof the guarantee) for each individual commodity determined in any year in thelight of an annual review shall be not less than 96 per cent of the guaranteed price determined in the light of the previous annual review.In addition, for livestock and livestock products (i.e. those productsat present covered by the minimum price provisions in Section 5 of the agriculture Act,  1947) there will be a limitation of 9 per cent in any   threeyears on the amount by which the guaranteed prices for any of these productsmay be reduced.
3.     The following example illustrates the method of operation of these assurances.      If the guaranteed price for fat cattle for 1957 were determinedat,.say,  151,-Os. per live cwt. ,  then the guaranteed price for 1958 could not heless than 144. 96s.  (i. e.  96 per cent of 151.0s.);    and for 1959 not less than139*l6s.   (i.e.  96 per cent of 144.96s.);    and, to illustrate the effect ofthe limitation to 9 Pe*&quot; cent in three years, the guaranteed price for i960could not he less than 137&apos;41s.   (i. e. 91 per cent of 151.0s.).      If, however,for 1958 the guaranteed price for fat cattle in the above example were infact left unchanged at 151.0s., the minimum determination for 1959 would automatically become 144- 96s., instead of 139.l6s. ;    and the minimum determination-ations for subsequent years would also be raised automatically.      Likewise,if the guaranteed price were increased after any annual review,  the minimumdeterminations for subsequent years would be raised automatically above those previously obtaining.10.    Allowance will be made for the effect on the value of the guaranteed prices of any changes that are made in the bases of the guarantees,  such aschanges in the definitions of eligible produce or in the system of support.Thus, if for 1958 a change in the basis of the guarantee for fat cattle weremade that had the effect of reducing the value of the prevailing guaranteed price by 1. Os. per cwt., the guaranteed price for 1958 could not be less than145.96s.   (which, on the old basis, would be equivalent to 144.96s.  - theminimum permitted under the assurance).11.    These assurances will have the following advantages over current arrange-ments for minimum prices.     They will be related, year by year,  through theapplication of the percentages, to the prevailing levels of guarantees whichwill themselves have been determined each year in the light of all relevant factors,  including movements in costs.      Thus account will automatically betaken year by year of changing circumstances.      Producers will also have a firm assurance that any reductions in guaranteed prices which may be found tobe necessary in the light of annual reviews will be made gradually, giving them time to adjust their production to changing circumstances.      The newassurances will have the further advantage that they will cover all crops
for which price guarantees are determined under the Agriculture Act, as wellas the livestock and livestock products previously covered by minimum prices.In view of this extension of minimum guarantees, the determination of actualcrop price guarantees after an annual review will relate to the immediatelysucceeding harvest, instead of the harvest of the following year.     This willenable the actual crop price guarantees each year to be determined nearer tothe period to which they relate and therefore on the basis of more up-to-date information about cost changes and other relevant factors.The Assurance about the Total Value of the Guarantees12.    The Government have decided that the assurances on the individual commoditites-ities should be accompanied by a general assurance that would limit the  scope for reduction in the total value of the guarantees at each annual review.This will reduce the element of uncertainty inseparable from the maintenanceof annual reviews.     It will also limit the extent to which the guarantees ona number of individual commodities could be reduced at one time.13.    In considering the form which such a minimum assurance might take,  thefollowing have been important points.     It is essential that the Governmentshould be able to take proper account of factors that might justify a reduc-tion in the value of the guarantees, e. g. Exchequer liability, market require-ments, cost decreases,  increasing efficiency.      The Farmers&apos; Unions, on theother hand, have been most concerned about the possibility of cost increases.The undertaking that has been agreed meets both these points of view.      It isthat the total value of the guarantees will be maintained each year at notless than the amount resulting from taking 97s per cent of the total value ofthe guarantees in the preceding year and adding cost increases or subtractingcost decreases that have occurred on review commodities since the last annual review.Ik&apos;    The total value of the guarantees for this purpose is estimated to be ofthe order of  1,150 millions a year at present.     This value will be calculatedat each annual review.     The general method will be to multiply the currentguaranteed prices (excluding any interim changes made in the light of a special review) by the appropriate quantities of output in the current year, and to add the value of the production grants.     For this purpose, as for annual
reviews generally, the production grants are those in respect of matters forwhich the occupier is normally responsible.     The cost changes taken intoaccount will be all those that have occurred on review commodities since thelast annual review, on the basis of a full year&apos;s operation.     For example,if the total value of the guarantees were  1,150 millions, 97? per cent ofthis would-be  1,121 millions.      This would represent the minimum total valueof the new guarantee determinations if no cost changes had occurred since theprevious annual review.     But if there had been a cost increase of  20 nillxons,the minimum total value would be  1,141 millionsj and if therc hadbeen a cost decrease of  20 millions the minimum total value would be 1,101 millions.15.    This undertaking takes specific account of cost changes since these arethe most important element from the industry&apos;s point of view.     The pos-sibility that the undertaking should also take specific account of increasing efficiency has been examined.     There are, however, great difficulties in theway of assessing precisely the value of changes in efficiency from year to year.     No attempt has therefore been made to provide specifically for this in the undertaking.      But the Government and the farmers&apos; representativesagree that the increasing efficiency of the industry is an important factorthat should continue to be taken into account at each annual review along with cost changes and other relevant factors.16.   While the above arrangements will set a lower limit to any change inthe total value of the guarantees, the actual change to be made in any year will be determined, as at present, after an annual review at which all con-siderations have been taken into account.     The new level in any year cannotbe less than that required by the minimum assurance;    the extent to which itwill exceed this minimum will depend on a balanced assessment of all the fac-tors such as the trend of net income, production and market requirements,Exchequer liability, increasing efficiency and so on.      These arrangements will impose a major limitation on the Government&apos;s discretion to reduce thevalue of the guarantees and should give substantial protection to the net income of the industry.     There will still be the possibility of a
Ijsignificant reduction in the guarantees according to circumstances.     This mustwbe so if all relevant factors are to continue to be taken into account.      but even if the total value of the guarantees were reduced in any year by the maximum permissible amount (at present about  29 millions plus or minus cost changes), theeffect on the net income of the industry would be considerably less, since therewould on the other side be the off-setting factor of the value of the annual increase in efficiency, which the Government have previously assessed at about 25 millions a year for review commodities, and any other factors tending toincrease net income.Introduction of the New Arrangements17.     The new arrangements for assurances relating to commodity guarantees will replace the provisions of Section 5 of the Agriculture Act, 1947.    The Governmentwill introduce legislation in due course to amend Section 5 and to give statutoryeffect to all the new assurances.      Although such legislation will not have been passed before the 1957 annual review, the Government propose to observe the newassurances in making their determinations in the light of that review.     For thepurpose of the 9f0 minimum assurance for livestock and livestock products over a three-year period, the first period will commence at the 1957 annual review,so that the guaranteed prices to be determined for such products for 1959/60 will be not lessthan 91 per cent of those already determined for 1956/57.18.     The percentages for both the commodity assurances and the general assurancewill be reconsidered by the Government, in consultation vrith the Farmers&apos; Unions,after four years - that is,  after the 1960 annual review.      If in the light ofthis reconsideration the Government conclude that airy change is required, theywill give at least twelve months&apos; notice, so that any new percentages that maybe decided upon will not take effect before 1962/63;    otherwise the originalpercentages will continue to apply.Special Reviews19.     Provision was made for special reviews when the system of guaranteesconsisted of fixed prices and., for many commodities, Government purchase whichwas regarded as somewhat analogous to an annual contract.      It was then thoughtappropriate for account to be taken of any substantial change in conditions thatmight seem to justify between annual reviews an alteration in the contract terms.But, since the return to free market conditions, the guarantee arrangements havemainly taken the form of a deficiency payments system which bears no analogy to a contract.     Furthermore, the idea of automatic recoupment of cost changes,8.
particularly of wage changes,  is out of line with current economic needs or general economic policy.     The Government consider that save in exceptional circumstances it is reasonable to await the outcome of the following annual review for an adjustment of the guarantees, particularly in view of the proposed change whereby the crop price guarantees will be determined each year for the immediately succeeding harvest instead of the harvest of the following year.20.     The Government have therefore proposed, and the farmers&apos; representatives have accepted, that provision should continue to be made for the holding ofspecial reviews but that the following new arrangements should be introduced sothat such reviews will be held only to meet exceptional circumstances.     these arrangements will be that:-(i) Special reviews will be held only if the relevant effect of the particularcost change in question is more than ^ per cent of the total value of the guarantees (this percentage would at present be about  9 millions);    the relevant effect, for this purpose, will be the effect,  on review commodities-ties for which guaranteed prices were determined after the precedingannual review, for that part of the year still to run before the nextannual review determinations can become operative,(ii) If a special review were held, then:(a) there v/ould be no adjustment to the guaranteed prices in respect ofthat part of the cost change which was equivalent to -g- per cent of thetotal value of the guarantees (at present about  6 millions);(b) there would be adjustment to guaranteed prices to cover in full any amount by which the cost change exceeded 1 per cent of the total value ofthe guarantees (at present about  11-g- millions);    and(c) the Government would determine,in the light of existingcircumstances, what adjustment,  if any, should be made in respectof that part of the cost change falling between -g- per cent and 1 percent of the total value &apos;of the guarantees.If any adjustment vrere made, it would be distributed as uniformly as practicableamong commodities in accordance with the incidence of the cost change.
Farm Improvement Scheme21.    Grants are already available for comprehensive schemes in hill farming and livestock rearing areas.     Throughout the country, grants are availablefor drainage and water supply schemes;    and will shortly be available for silos.Help in respect of farmhouses and cottages can.be made available under theHousing Acts,     At present levels, grants under these exxsting provisionsmight amount - to some  45 millions over the next ten years.22.    The industry must seek progressively to reduce its working costs andso require less support against the effects of low market prices if it isto make its full contribution to the national economy.      But efficient work-ing on many farms to-day is still handicapped by inadequate or out-of-datefarm buildings or other permanent farm equipment.     Modernisation of these items offers the best way of making an effective contribution towardslowering production costs.23.    The Government, therefore, now propose to introduce, subject to thenecessary legislation and Parliamentary approval, a wider scheme of grants for assisting the provision of permanent fixed equipment and the making of long-term improvements to land.      Under the new scheme, details of which arebeing discussed with representatives of landowners and farmers, grants at33i per cent would, with limited exceptions, be payable for all the mainpermanent improvements not already covered by grant,  including individualimprovements in livestock rearing areas.      The Government hope that this newprovision will lead to a great programme of modernisation of farms in all parts of the United Kingdom;    and that,  by providing a lasting increase inefficiency,it will in due course permit of reduction in the support afforded to the industry through price guarantees.24-    With the proposed grants, total new investment in permanent fixed equip-ment over ton years might amount to some  320 millions, an increase of some30 per cent over what would be achieved at the current rate.      Towards thecost of this,  total grant payments, under new and existing legislation,might be some  95 millions.25.    It is intended that, in general,  grants should-be payable in respect ofthe erection, alteration, enlargement and reconditioning of farm buildings and a number of other permanent improvements including roads and bridges,
the supply of electricity for agricultural purposes and the reclamationof land.     Certain joint improvements bringing benefit to more than oneholding will be accepted for grant.      Grants will be available forgeneral buildings on horticultural holdings comparable with those found on agricultural holdings, but not in respect of specialised buildings and equipment on horticultural holdings, such as glasshouses, Dutchlights and their heating equipment and gas and cold-stores.26.    The grants will be available in respect of all equipped farm unitsthat are economic or could be made so with the improvement proposed.In applying this test, the Government intend that assistance snouldonly be given to farms which can yield to the occupier a net incomeat least equivalent to that of an agricultural worker.27.    Beyond this test relating to the holding to be improved, theGovernment propose also that each improvement considered for grant-aid should be such as could be expected to give a reasonable and lastingreturn on the total cost by v/ay of increased profitability tothe    occupier    and   increased rental value to the owner.Details of the scheme and its application to particular forms of equipment will, however, be worked out in consultation withrepresentatives of the farmers end landowners.28.    An important element in any general scheme for re-equippingagriculture must be provision for the merging and re-grouping of uneconomic holdings into economically viable units.     The grants will therefore cover the cost of equipping uneconomic units as part of an amalgamation scheme and will also give special help towards certain other costs involved in the amalgamation process.29&apos;    Buildings play an especially important part in the economy of thesmall farm which as a rule is devoted mainly to livestock production.The improvements which should be brought about by the new scheme of grants will, therefore, be of particular benefit to the small farmer.A system of&apos;direct grants will also be advantageous to the owner with
I 92limited resources who does not benefit to any great extent from the allowances in respect of capital improvements under the Income Tax Act., 1952.       So far as concerns the owner1 a. share of the cost of improvements, the Government have been assured by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, the Scottish AgriculturalSecurities Corporation, and the Lands Improvement Company   that   no credit-worthyowner should find it difficult, in normal circumstances, to raise a loan at currentinterest, rates po cover the major part, if not all, of his share of thecost of an approved scheme.     There are similar facilities under the scliemes foragricultural development loans administered by the Ministry of Agriculture for northern Ireland.Long-Term Policy30.     The Government have given the industry from time to time general guidance on the directions in which production can best proceed in the national interest.Many farmers would like more detailed guidance than this and would like to be told.exactly what they should produce and how much they may expect to get for it.This is not possible in a free economy.     Any attempt by the Government to stateprecise commodity production targets in this way could only be based on a numberof arbitrary assumptions that might very well be falsified in the future by eventsquite outside the control of either the Government or the industry.     This wouldnot in the long run, therefore, be helpful either to the farmers or to the country.In present circumstances the Governments responsibility is to provide theconditions in which an efficient industry can operate with confidence in thefuture, and that will continue to be a major Government objective.31.     The Governmenfs long-term policy for agriculture continues to be tosupport and assist the industry to achieve maximum economic output.     The first objective must be to obtain as much as possible of such output from home resources,with less reliance on imported feedingstuffs.      This would bring greater and morecertain relief to the balance of payments than would an indiscriminate increasein gross&apos; output.     The extent to which further expansion in output is desirablemust also depend on market requirements and on the ability of the industry toproduce what the consumer wants at a reasonable cost.     Market requirements willcontinue to be conditioned by the purchasing power of consumers, by our commonwealth obligations and by the need for a high level of international trade.
(.   ^)32.     The condition of agriculture will continue to be reviewed annually andthe actual guarantees will be determined in the light of that review and ofnational needs.      The new arrangements set out above form a comprehensive assurance to the industry that the Government are determined to provide the support requiredfor maximum economic and efficient production, that any necessary changes will bemade gradually, that full account will be taken in consultation with the industry&apos;sleaders of all the factors affecting the fortunes of the industry, and that theindustry will be given still further encouragement to improve its capacity toproduce as efficiently and economically as possible.     This should assure areasonable return to the industry and provide a sound basis for planning ahead.
