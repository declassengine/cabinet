We admire the steadfast way in which theyhave faced these dangers, and in particular the courage and resource of thenumbers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who have borne the brunt ofthese attacks.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that thesituation is still fraught with danger, which the people of Northern Irelandhave faced and are facing with exemplary restraint in the face of greatprovocation.2.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government have not been inactive in the face of this threat to Northern Ireland.    Immediately after the outbreak of violenceon 12th December, H. M. Ambassador in Dublin arranged to see the republican Minister of External Affairs with a view to obtaining furtherinformation from him and warning him at the same time of the seriousview which was likely to be taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of theseevents.3.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government were on the point ef instructing the ambassador in Dublin to make a strong protest to the Republican Govern-ment, when the Republican Government made a statement about itsG.LL.-G.H.18th December, 1956.NORTHERN IRELAND
intentions on 14th December.    In this statement the Republican Governmentsaid :;hat they had determined to take, in conjunction with the police and defence forces of the Republic, such steps as they deemed necessary and appropriate to prevent activities which, if they were allowed to continue,would inevitably cause loss of life.    In the light of that statementHer Majesty*s Government decided to direct H. M. Ambassador to deliver a communication expressing their very great concern at the recentincidents in Northern Ireland and the hope that the important objectivewhich the Republican Government had proclaimed in their forthrightstatement would be effectively and successfully secured.4.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the same time sent a communication to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland expressing their sympathy withthe people of Northern Ireland in the ordeal to which they had been subjected.5.      In the Ireland Act, 1949, the Parliament at Westminster declaredNorthern Ireland to be an into gral part of the United Kingdom.    Thesecurity of Northern Ireland is the direct concern of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government will, of course, take whateversteps may prove to be necessary to defend Northern Ireland, as theywould any other part of the United Kingdom, against attacks from what-ever source they may come.
