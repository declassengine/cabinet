(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(56) 262 COPY NO.^ H*12th November, 1956CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS DISQUALIFICATION bill memorandum by the Attorney general as the Select Committee reported the House of commons disqualification Bill in the form which I recommended in the evidence Igave, the Cabinet may like to have my comments on the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum (C.F.(56) 259).2. T agree with his proposal that we should reject &quot;reversedisqualification&quot;.    I should prefer to base my rejection on two maingrounds.   The first is that it would apply to (and therefore, in the case ofmembers, automatically invalidate) appointments made by Her majesty in the exercise of the Royal prerogative.    Royal Charters of incorporation,for example, not only create offices b .&apos;t frequently make the firstappointments to them; a system of reverse disqualification would rendernull and void any such appointment of a sitting Member of Parliament.This result is plainly wrong in principle.    The second main ground is thatthe system would be of only limited application.   It would not be possible,for example, to provide that a serving soldier elected to the House shouldbe automatically discharged from his engagement or that a member of aforeign legislature sho ild on election to the House lose his seat in theforeign assembly.    W e should therefore be obliged to adoottwo systems of disqualification.   This result would, it seems to me, be very inconvenientin practice.3. I agree with the Home Secretary&apos;s recommendation that weshould arprove in principle the main changes made in the Bill by theSelect Committee and set out in paragraphs 4-7 of CP.(56) 259.4. [ do not agree with the Home Secretary&apos;s comments on Clause 1(4).In my view there is no substance in the argument that a Minister&apos;s policyof not appointing Members of Parliament to certain offices might beultra vires  if holders of such offices were not disqualified from membership of the House of Commons.I see nothing wrong in a Minister deciding not to appoint members to certain offices.   The Select Committee were considering fitness to bea Member of Parliament.    They did not consider the fitness of a Memberof Parliament to hold a particular office.   That is the responsibility ofMinisters.    Consequently I do not think Ministers would be open to severectiticism if they decided not to appoint   members to offices, the holders of which were not disqualified from membership of the House.-1-
what does appear to me to be wrong is the procedure (adopted,I understand, by the Minister of Pensions) of making disqualification froman office operate automatically on the nomination of the holder as a parliamentary candidate.   That procedure is, I think, inconsistent withthe spirit of Clause 1(4) and in my view is likely to lead to trouble.Experience has shown that an office holder may well be unaware that hehas incurred any kind of disqualification and if a member of (say) an industrial injuries tribunal were to continue, as he well might, to act assuch after he had. incurred dis jualification, the decisions of the tribunalmight be invalidated.   It would not, of course, be easy to restore them without legislation or to satisfy Parliament that such legislation was desirable.5. I suggest that Ministers should reserve the right to excludeactive party politicians from certain posts, whether or not the Houseconsiders that the holders of those posts can properly be members, butthat they should exercise the right by making the original appointmentsubject to the express condition that the holder should offer his resignationon being nominated  as a candidate at a Parliamentary election.   If theoffice holder failed to comply with this condition he would render himselfliable to dismissal but the legality of his subsequent acts could not beimpeached.    The Minister concerned would therefore be able to keepparty politicians out of these apnointments without exposing himself to anyof the very real difficulties inherent in the procedure at present adoptedby the Minister of Fensions.6. I agree in principle that we should re-introduce the Bill inthe exact terms in which it was reported by the Select Committee.    I think,however, that before presentation we should, if only as a matter ofcourtesy to the House, make the amendments necessary to correct obviouserrors, such as the deletion of offices which no longer exist and therectification of misnomers.R.E. M.-B.Law Officers&apos; De-partment, W.C.2.12th November, 19 56
