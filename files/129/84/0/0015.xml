confidential cp.(56) 265 COPY NO.     f17th November, 1956.CABINETMARKETING OF PIGS AND BACONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food on 11th July the Cabinet authorised the publication of thereport of the Reorganisation Commission for Pigs and Bacon(CM.(56) 48th Conclusions, Minute 11).     The Commission^recommendations have since been discussed with the interests concerned.    The conclusions which we have reached on future policy for the industry have now been approved by the Home AffairsCommittee and we propose to publish them on 27th November asa White paper, a copy of which is annexed.2.        The only substantial point which is likely to provecontroversial is the rejection of a marketing board for all pigs,and while the National Farmers1 Unions must be expected to express their disappointment they are not likely unduly to press their opposition.    On the other hand, they will be pleased that we are notaccepting the Commission^ proposals for regulating the marketing of bacon pigs which would have had serious consequences for the farmers&apos; own Fatstock Marketing Corporation.3. We propose to accept the recommendation of the commission that a Pig Industry Development Authority, representing all sectionsof the industry and financed by a levy on each pig slaughtered, shouldbe established to look after technical development in the whole field of pig production, processing and distribution.    This will be welcomed both by producers and the trade.4.        Taken as a whole, our proposals are likely to meet withfairly general support.J.S.D.H.A.16th November, 1956.

A POLICY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PIG INDUSTRYIN THE UNITED KINGDOMIntroductory1,        After making a rapid recovery from- the very low levels to which itwas reduced during and after the war, the pig industry is today playing amore important role than ever before in our agricultural economy. Between1931/32 (which saw the beginning of the pre-war arrangements for government support to the industry) and 1955/56 the farm output of pigmeat in theUnited Kingdom rose from 315,000 tons to about 615,000 tons with a value ofabout  165 million.    This represents more than one-eighth by value of totalagricultural output, and more than onenfifth of all the meat and baconconsumed in this country.   During that period important changes have takenplace not only in the techniques of production and in methods of processingand distribution,, but also in the methods employed to provide support foragricultures2,        Before the war the support given to the industry took the form of restrictions on imports of bacon which were designed to maintain pig prices at a remunerative level.   Today, however, it is the policy of the Governmentto remove quantitative restrictions on imports and to provide support forthe agricultural industry as a whole by the system of guaranteed pricesestablished under the Agriculture Act 1947$, combined where appropriate withmoderate tariffs on imports*   In pursuance of this policy the importationof bacon and pork has been returned to private traders, and quantitative restrictions have been removed except on imports from a few countries wherefor special reasons they must remain for the time being.   At the same time a tariff of 10 per cent ad valorem has been imposed on imports of bacon andpork from foreign countries,3,        The Government have now completed a review of the problems confront-ing the industry in the changed circumstances in which it is now operatingeIn this they have been greatly assisted by the reports of the Committeewhich was appointed under the Chairmanship of Sir Harold Hewitt to advise on the development of pig production, and of the Reorganisation Commission-1-
appointed under the Agriculture Marketing Acts,, of -which Dr.. CeleC. Bosanquet -was Chairman, to advise on the marketing of pigs and pig products.4e       The reports of both these bodies have been published,,   and their recommendations have been discussed with the interests concerned.   Inthe light of the reports and discussions the Government have adopted the folio-wing policy for the marketing of pigs and the technical development of the pig ind3.ktryeLong Term Policy5.       The main tasks facing the pig industry, in the words of there organisation Commission, are &quot;to reduce its costs of production,processing and distribution, and to improve the quality of its products and the service offered to consumers, so that the industry will be ableto face foreign competition without the need for substantial government support.&quot;   The general purpose of Government policy must therefore be toassist the industry to attain a progressively higher level of technical efficiency, since it is on this that the achievement of these objectsultimately depends.60       Proposals for dealing directly with the complex technical problemsconfronting the industry are set out below (paragraphs 13-20)), but theGovernment recognise that a narrowly technical approach to these problems would be of little value unless the economic conditions in which theindustry is operating are such as to establish confidence in its future and to provide the industry with an incentive to take full advantage of technical advances.   The a&amp;nrinistration of the guarantee given under the agriculture Act 1947 and the present marketing arrangements have accordingly been re-examined from this point of vie\t.x    Gmd. 9,588 and Gmd. 9795
7bGuarantee ArrangemeBtii7c        The Government are satisfied that the present system of deficiency round- is well adapted to ensure an adequate return to the industry with-out impeding the operation of market - forces which play an essential part in securing that the balance-of production in the   different branches of theindustry is kept in harmony with the changing demands of consumers,,   Accord-ingly no fundamental ehaage is proposed in   the framework of the present arrangements 9   although the-possibility is not excluded that it may   benecessary to modify them in detail from time to time,     In   particular theGovenrsmeiat have   decided to introduce next year certain changes in gradingstandards, which form the basis   for the payment of quality premiums underthe guarantee scheme980        The Hewitt Committee recommended that a full   review should be madeof grading standards for bacon pigs, and a departmental committee comprisingall the interests concerned   was set up for this purpose,.   The departmentalcommittee*s report emphasised that while the general   improvement of thequality of bacon pigs through progeny testing and   selective breeding isa long term process$ it can be assisted by progressive improvements ingrading standards0   The - Government have accepted the committee&apos;recommendation for the introduction of a minimum length measurement of775        (3&amp;k inches) as   from 25th Marehp 1957o   The criteria (includinglength) for the purpose of any   quality premium in connection with theguarantee payments will be determined after the next Annual Review,,   changes will also be introduced to raise the present standards in relation tograding by weight range and back fat;, details of which are being announcedoWhile it is desirable in the long-term interest of the industry that gradingstandards should be raised as quickly as possible;, it is also necessary togive sufficient notice of chassges to allow producers   an opportunity toimprove their management and techniques and it has therefore been decidedthat, apart from the introduction of the length measurements all the abovechanges shall come into effect on 16th September9 1957 s io98 half way through the 1957/58 livestock years   Grading standards will   continue to bekept under review 9 and in this the Government will be greatly assisted bythe advice of the Pig Industry Development Authority (see paragraph 13 below).
9a        She Government have considered whether some regulation of the marketis necessary to provide a greater degree of assurance to producers than isafforded by the operation of the guarantee arrangements,    To this end there organisation Commission proposed special statutory arrangements to govern the marketing of pigs sold to bacon curers.   These arrangements arecomplicated and it is doubtful whether the elaborate negotiations they wouldinvolve could be expected to have the results envisaged by the Commission,,They  would require the wholehearted co-operation of farmers and bacon curersif they were to operate successfully0   But they are viewed with disfavour by both sides of the industry, who would prefer a continuation of the present arrangements under which bacon factories are free to purchase pigs in what-ever way   they prefers either direct from farmers or through organisationssuch as the Fatstook Marketing Corporation.   For these reasons, theGovernment have decided that it would be wrong to impose them on an unwillingindustry^10c        Another possibility would be the establishment of a marketing board for all pigs.    This is favoured by the   National   Farmers&quot; Union, whoseproposals are analysed with great care   and thoroughness in the Commissionsreport o11*        The Commission point out the peculiar complexities of the pig industryin Great Britain which they contrast with other industries regulated bymarketing boards*   They point out that &quot;the markets for wool and for milk are wholly different in character to the market for pigmeat.&quot;   The pig industryis producing not a single relatively standardised article to meet a relatively stable demand, but pigs of different types to meet the special requierements of the three main markets, the curing industry, the fresh porkindustry and the manufacturing industry, the relative strength of whose demandsis continually changing.   In these   circumstances a marketing board &quot;wouldhave the responsibility of estimating demand for   all types of pigmeat5 of
fixing prices to all farmers for each weight and grade of pigs   of fixing the proportion of pigs sold to the bacon industry, to the fresh pork tradeand to meat manufacturers j   of deciding the number sold direct to each traderthrough, each fatstock auction market and each meat market;   and of deciding the prises to be charged to each section of the trade,58   naming regard to thedifficulty of striking a balance between the many and continuously varyingfactors involved, the Commission concluded that such a concentration of major decisions about pigmeat distribution in the hands of a relatively small group of people would lead to   serious difficulties and on occasionsto grave mistakes, especially in view of the highly perishable nature ofthe products12.        The Government   are impressed   by the   force of these arguments which are more fully   set out in the Commission^ report, reinforced as theyare by the careful study which the Commission made of the practical experienceof the pre-war marketing boards,   Moreoever, the Government recognise thatthe structure of the industry as described by the Commission is not statie,and they have been impressed by the promising developments which are takingplace    today in the marketing of meat and livestock generally, and which   arenowhere more conspicuous than in the pig sector of the industry.   A marketingboard based on the structure of the industry as it is today, even if it weremade to work despite the formidable difficulties pointed out by the Commission,might well inhibit this process of organic growth and adaptation within theindustry itself.    The Government believe that the long term interests of theindustry will be better served by encouraging these developments, which havealready achieved considerable success, and they accordingly agree with theview of the Commission that a basically free market in pigs and pigmeat isto be preferred to a marketing board for all pigs,,   In arriving   at thisdecision, the Government have been particularly influenced by the extent towhich an effective service to producers is now   being provided   by voluntary-operative organizations, such as the Fatstock Marketing Corporation.
Technical Development13*    In the field of measures directly designed to assist the technical development of the industry, the Reorganisation Commission recommendedthat &quot;a Pig Industry Development Authority should be established on a statutory basis to draw up and put into effect a programme for securingimprovements in the whole field of pig production, processing anddistribution from the farm to the retaL 1 shop&quot;*14*    The Government have accepted in principle this recomraerrlation whichhas received a wide measure of support from all sections of the industryand propose to introduce legislation to establish an Authority on thelines recommended by the Commission.15o   The Authority will consist of seventeen members appointed by ministers.    The Chairman and two others will be appointed from outsidethe pig industry, and the other fourteen members will be appointed afterconsultation with the various sections of the industry on the following basis -160   The Authority will have wide powers to carry out services for thebenefit of the whole industry, based on the recommendations of there organisation Commission.   These will include the operation of a nationalpig recording scheme, the supervision of progeny testing, the introductionof an accredited herds scheme, the development of a national artificial insemination service, the financing of research and development work,and the improvement of market intelligence.   The Authority will also beempowered to establish a British Bacon Mark, a function which under the commissions proposals for the marie ting of bacon pigs (see paragraph 9)would have been allotted to a marketing supervisory commissions17o   To finance its activities the Authority will be given powers of levy on each pig slaughtered, the amount of the levy being subject to theapproval of Ministers.   It is not contemplated that in its early years theAuthority will need more than  500,000 per year*Commercial pig farmersPedigree pig breedersAgricultural workersBacon curersBacon distributorsFresh meat distributorsPigmeat manufacturersProcessing and distributive workers42121211sn     5
18o   One of the first tasks of the Authority will be to consider the reocm-mendations of the Hewitt Committee that sail for action by the industryitselfo   The Government will hand over to the Authority a number of services such as National Pig Records, which are at present operated by the AgriculturalDepartmentso   The ownership of the progeny testing stations, which have been built with producers&quot; own money and are to be operated by the National PigProgeny Testing Boards will be vested in the Authority,,19o   The Authority will not be empowered to control the actions of individuals or firmso   The licensing of boarss and any necessary statutory regulation of artificial, insemination will, therefore, continue to be the direct responsibilityof the Agricultural minister so   In exercising their powers in these fields theMinisters will seek to support the actions of the Authority, and to sustainits programme of developmento20.   Amending legislation will accordingly be introduced at a later date togive effect to most of the Hewitt Cc8Hmittee&apos;s recommendations about boarlicensing, but the recommendation that restrictions should be placed on theuse of boars of certain breeds has been Judged to be administrativelyimpracticable and will not therefore be adopted.Legislation21o   Legislation providing for the establishment of the Pig industry development Authority will be introduced as soon as practicable.   The oppor-tunity will be taken to repeal the Bacon Industry Acts 1938 and 1939, theprovisions of which have been suspended since 1939 under Defence Regulations.As a consequence of this repeal the Bacon Development Board will be wound up.22*   The Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board were establishedearlier by schemes under the Agricultural Marketing Aots9   The schemes will,be revoked and the Boards1 will be wound up.Northern Ireland23*   The proposals contained in this paper, (apart from those relating to theguarantee arrangements)s apply only to Great Britain.   In Northern Ireland thelegislation enacted in 1954s under which the Pigs Marketing Board (NorthernIreland) is the sole buyer of pigs of more than 140 lb. deadweight, will remain.The Ministry of Agriculture (Northern Ireland) in consultation with the PigAdvisory Committee - a statutory body - are responsible for functions similarto those proposed for the Pig Industry Development Authority in Great Britain,and this arrangement will also continue to operate.
