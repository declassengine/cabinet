My colleagues will wish to be aware of this, when considering the memorandum on commercial oolicy (CP.(56) 256).H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.12th November, 1956
CANADIAN REACTION TO PLAN GSince the meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in washington on 29th September, and the preceding visit of the Presidentof the Board of Trade to Ottawa, the Canadian Government has given careful attention to the proposal that the United Kingdom should join a free trade area embracing most of Western Europe.In view of the widespread interest in this subject it has beendecided that the Prime Minister will shortly make a public statement.The text of this statement is given at the end of this message.   There isno need for me to add anything at this time except to say that we shall ofcourse be watching developments in this field with close attention and will no doubt wish to discuss matters with your Government through the normal channels from time to time.PRESS STATEMENT TO BE ISSUEDBY THE PRIME MINISTER OF canada the Right Honourable Louis St. -Laurent, Prime Minister, todayissued the following statement on behalf of the Government in response to questions that have recently been addressed to Ministers concerningthe suggestion that the United Kingdom might join a free trade areaembracing most of Western Europe:&quot;The Canadian Government has been informed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade of the proposals under consideration by the Government of the United Kingdom which wouldinvolve the United Kingdom entering a free trade area in Western Europealong with France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Germany andItaly (who are considering the establishment of a full customs unionamong the six of them), and other countries of Western Europe.   The entryby the United Kingdom into such a free trade arrangement with european countries would entail the removal by defined stages of its customs duties on the products of such countries in return for reciprocal action on their part toward  United Kingdom products.   The United Kingdom proposes thatthis arrangement would not apply to foodstuffs, feeds, beverages or tobacco.In that event such advantages as are now accorded by the United Kingdom to imports of these types of products from other Commonwealth countries would not be affected.&quot;Even with the exclusion of such products, the changes in UnitedKingdom and European trading relations involved in the carrying out ofthese proposals would present a number of problems for Canadian tradewith the countries concerned.   The various possible effects upon Canada&apos;strade and upon our existing trade arrangements will require detailed study by the Government and thorough discussions with the otherGovernments concerned.&quot;It will be important that the carrying out of these proposalsproceed according to a definite programme and on a firm time table andbe accompanied by appropriate internal economic policies.   The proposed new arrangements will have their most beneficial effects if they are brought into being with a minimum of discrimination against the trade of-1-
other countries and if the expansion of mutually advantageous tradingrelations with other countries is encouraged.   If the proposals are carried through with determination and at the same time the countries concernedproceed forthrightly with the removal of other trade barriers between themselves and also against other countries, as they are already pledged to do, it should be possible to surmount any difficulties which may be created and to increase the flow of trade and maintain the ties between this large European area and the rest of the world.   On the other hand a partial development that resulted only in the creation of a new system ofintra-European tariff preferences would interfere with trade betweenEurope and other countries, including Canada, without achieving the positiveresults which are expected from a full implementing of the plan.Similarly it would be a matter of concern to us if the pursuit of thisEuropean objective, worthy as it is, were to result in an increase in tariffs against non-European countries or in less effort or willingness to reduce the other barriers to the development of competitive multilateral trade, which is the overriding objective of the Canadian Government andof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.&quot;Should the proposals be adopted and successfully carried throughby Britain and nations of Western Europe they should increase the economic strength and prosperity of the peoples of that whole great area and alsotheir sense of solidarity and common purpose even beyond the economicfield.   Such a result could not fail to be welcomed by Canadians whosesecurity, and cultural and political heritage as well as economic welfarehave been, and are, so closely linked with that part of the world. &quot;
