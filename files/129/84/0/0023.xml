secret.P.(56) 273 COPY NO.7th December. 1956CABINETCYPRUSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a draft statement on Cyprus prepared by the Colonial Policy Committee.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.1.6th December, 1956
Lord Radcliff e&apos;s report on a constitution for Cyprus is&quot;being published today as a White Paper in the United Kingdomand in Cyprus,    It is in two part*s - the recommendations forthe constitution and a covering note which explains why hehas preferred his conclusions to other possible arrangements.His proposals have been carefully devised to hold a fair balance between the different and often conflicting interest which are involved.It is a statesmanlike document and the whole House will,I am sure, be grateful for the vigour with which he hascarried out his task and the wisdom which he has shown.Her Majesty&apos;s Government after consultation with theGovernor of Cyprus accepts the proposals which Lord Radcliffehas made.   We will be prepared to introduce such a constitu-tion as soon as we are satisfied that a situation ex5 sts in cyprus in which genuine elections can be heldf^ee from&apos;Violen.ce and intimidation.A start is at once being made with the drafting of thenecessary constitutional instruments so that elections maybe held as soon as conditions allow.[Her Majesty&apos;s Government has brought these proposals tothe attention of the Greek and Turkish Governments..   (Thisparagraph will probably need expanding).]As the House knows the Terms of Reference given toLord Radcliffe&apos;laid down among other requirements that duringthe period of the constitution,  Cyprus is to remain under british sovereignty.As regards the future, Her Majesty&apos;s Government havealready affirmed their recognition of the principle ofself-determination.    When the international and strategicsituation permits, and when self-Government is workingsatisfactorily, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready to review the question of the application of self-determination.When the time comes for this review, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be guided by the principle that the rightof self-determination ought to be enjoyed, through a plebiscite, by Turkish Cypriots no less than &quot;by GreekCypriots,    Therefore, despite the evident disadvantages of partition,&apos;Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not exclude this as an eventual solution.[Now that we have had the opportunity of discussing theseproposals with the Greek and Turkish Governments and considering their views on them, we propose to show the proposals and the terms of my statement to Archbishop Makarios.    Thisis being done this afternoon.    The Government will of courseconsider any observations which he may make on the content ofthe proposals as well as those of other leaders of opinion in Cyprus.]I hope that we are on the eve of a new and happychapter in the long history of Cyprus.    It is the intentionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government to do all that it can to bring this about.
