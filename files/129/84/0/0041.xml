\Gs1Lg3. Although the 1948 Treaty was apparently designed as a vehicle for aid to. Jordan and to enable the maintenance of United kingdom forces in Jordan, its main provisions are drafted in reciprocal terms.It does not, however, create an exclusive alliance between Jordan and theUnited Kingdom.   The Treaty and the conduct of the Parties should be examined against the background of certain other Treaties to whichJordan is a Party (see Papers A, B and D).   At the time of signature of the 1948 Treaty, Jordan was a member of the Arab League togetherwith Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen.   Articles 2and 6 of the Covenant of the    eague of Arab States of 1 945 (Paper A)provided for their co-operation for defence against aggression.   TheTreaty of brotherhood and Alliance of 1947 between Jordan and Iraq(Paper 3) is in many respects comparable with the 1948 Treaty.   Boththe Covenant of the League of Arab States and the Treaty with Iraqare preserved by Article 4 of the 1948 Treaty.   &quot;.n March 1952, Jordanbecame a Party to the Arab League Security Fact (Paper B), withoutobjection by Ker Maj &apos;sty&apos;s Government.   The Pact was made inaccordance with Article 6 of the Covenant of the League of Arab Statesand Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.   Articles 1-6 and theMilitary Annex to the pact provided for co-operation between theParties in matters of security and defence.   Article 3 of the Pactprovided for the unification of military plans in the event of the imminentrisk of war.4. By Article 7, the 19-&apos;8 Treaty is to remain in force for a periodof 2 0 years from the date of its coming- into force, namely 30th April, 1948.At any time after 15 years from that date it is subject to revision by negotiation which may be initiated at the request of either HighContracting Tarty.   There is no provision for termination by unilateral action before the expiration of the period of 29 years.   Therefore, thepresumption is that neither Party has the right unilaterally to terminate the Treaty sooner.5. &quot;iroadly speaking, there are three possible grounds on which  .Her Maj esty&apos;s Government might be entitled to terminate the 1948 Treaty.They are -(i)    The application of the rebus sic stantibus principle.(ii)    ?- enudiation of the Treaty by Jordan.(iii)     &apos;. reach of the Treaty by Jordan.6. The principle that all treaties are concluded under the tacitcondition rebus sic stantibus is generally recognised in international law.According to Oppenheim (8th ed. , vol.  i, p.  939):   &quot;Vital changes of circumstances may be of such a kind as to justify a party in demandingto be released from the obligations of a Treaty which cannot be abrogatedby unilateral notice&quot;.    It is then observed, however, &quot;The doctrine rebussic stantibus, when keut within prouer limits, embodies a general principle of law as expressed in the doctrines of frustration or super-vening impossibility of performance, or the like&quot;.    In practice,although the principle has been recognised by international tribunals,it has almost invariably been held not to apply in the particular case.In the present case, there have, of course, been changes in thepolit cal scene, but there does not seen; to have been any material change, e.p.  in the status or relations of the Parties, that would make the1948 Treaty impossible to perform.    indeed, on 29th October, 1956,
H.M. Ambassador in Tel Aviv warned the Government of Israel that anattack by Israel on Jordan would bring into operation the obligations0f Her fviajesty&apos;s Government to s?o to the assistance of Jordan under theTreaty.   At all material times, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have maintainedmilitary units in Jordan in accordance with the Treaty and have continuedto pay instalments of the subsidy in accordance with letter No. 5exchanged when the Treaty was signed (see Paper C, p. 16).   In thesecircumstances, it seems clear that the rebus sic stantibus principle hasno application to the 1948 Treaty.8. If the 1948 Treaty had been repudiated by Jordan, it would, inaccordance with international law, by open to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto accept the repudiation.    In effect, the Treaty would then be terminatedby the consent of both Parties.     It appears, however, that the Governmentof Jordan, while expressing an intention to terminate the Treaty at anearly date, have so far not purported to repudiate or abrogate the Treatyby unilateral action. &apos;9, The main question which falls to be considered is whether therehas been a breach of the 1948 Treaty by Jordan giving Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment the right to terminate the Treaty.    For the existence of this right it is necessary that there should be (i) a breach of the Treaty byJordan; (ii) a breach of a kind which gives rise to the right of termination;and (iii) that the breach, if any, has not been waived by Her majesty&apos;sGovernment.P.        The following are among the possible breaches by Jordan -(a) The adoption in regard to foreign countries of an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance between the United Kingdomand Jordan or which might create difficulties for the United Kingdomcontrary to paragraph 3 of Article 1.    (See paragraphs 11 and 13 below.)(b) &quot;ailure to co-ordinate defence matters within the scopeof the 1948 Treaty through the medium of the Anglo-Jordan Joint defence board as required by Article 2 of the Annex to the Treaty.    This Articledoes not contain an express obligation to consult, but it has been the viewof Her Majesty Is Government that such an obligation is implicit in theTreaty and that its existence is shown by the purpose of the Treaty as expressed in the Freamble, the reference to co-operation in Article 7,anc&apos; the provision for co-ordination of defence in Article 2 of the Annex.It will be seen, however, that the? only express provisions for the Partiesto &quot;concert together&quot; are (i) in Article 2 of the Treaty with reference toany dispute between either High Contracting Party and a third State whichwould involve the risk of a rupture with that State, and (ii) in Article 3 ofthe Treaty where it is provided that in the event of an imm nent menaceof hostilities the Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence.    (See paragraphs 11 and 12 below.)(c) The dismissal of General C. lubb and certain other officers without prior consultation with Ker Majesty&apos;s Government or&quot;otice to the Joint Defence Board.   Although this action may have beencontrary to the spirit of the Treaty, it is difficult to say that it was a breach of its letter.    Under Article 6(4) of the Annex to the Treaty, Her^.:esty&apos;s Government are under an obligation to provide, on request,critish Service personnel whose services are required to ensure theefficiency of the military units of the Jordanian forces, but there is no corresponding obligation on Jordan to request their services or to retain
them.   The dismissal of the officers does not seem to come under anyof the specific functions of the Anglo-Jordan Joint Defence Boardmentioned in Article 2 of the Annex, but the employment of the officers was of such great importance for the defence of Jordan that it might wellbe considered as a subject for co-ordination through the medium of thefoint Defence Board.   Perhaps it could also be argued that the abruptdismissal of these officers put it out of the power of Jordan to discharge the obligations under Article 3 of the Treaty and was therefore a breach of Article 1 of the Annex.(d)   The import and use of arms contrary to Article 6(6)(b) ofthe Annex to the Treaty which requires Jordan to ensure that the armament and essential equipment of the Jordanian forces shall not differ in typefrom those of the forces of Her Britannic Majesty.    It will be seen from Paper E that arms were imported from Egypt between 19th and28th Seotember, 1956, and from Iraq on 11th October, 1956.    It is under-stood that these arms were of British pattern.   Accordingly, this does notappear to be a breach of the provision in question, which does notprohibit the use of arms from sources other than the United Kingdom ifthey are of the same type as those of the forces of Her Britannic Majesty.The acquisition of small arms from a Soviet source, on or about20th November, 1956 might involve a breach of Article 6(6)(b) of the Annex,but this would depend on the nature, quantity and use of the arms about which it would be difficult to obtain conclusive evidence.11.        Whether there has been a breach under (a) or (b) of the preceding paragraph is a matter for assessment having regard to the course of conduct of the Parties to the 191-8 Treaty and the interpretation of its provisions.    With regard to (b) ,   it is probably difficult to establish a failure by Jordan to consult on any particular matter that could in itself be regarded as a breach of the Treaty, except possibly when Syrian,Saudi Arabian and Iraqi troops moved into Jordan at the request of the jordan Government in November 1956.   But even if this might be regardedas contrary to the obligation to consult or to co-ordinate defence matters,it may have been justified by the fact that at that time Her Majesty&apos;sCovernment, without prior consultation with Jordan, had embarked on military action against Egypt following the attack by Israel on Egypt.Besides, Jordan had some liberty to co-ordinate with other Arab Statesdefence measures against Israel.    ft has always been recognised that,while Her Majesty&apos;s Covernment would be obliged by the 1948 treaty to go to the assistance of Jordan if the latter were attacked by Israel,there would be no obligation to do so if Jordan were to attack Israel asa measure of collective self-defence taken with the other members of theArab League.   Article 4 of the 1948 Treaty expressly preserves the rightsof the Parties under the Charter of the United Nations and under otherexisting international agreements,    it does not appear, therefore, thatthe 1948 Treaty could be read as impairing Jordan&apos;s right of collectiveself-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter or her obligations as a member of the Arab League.    In other words, co-ordination ofdefence between Jordan and the other members of the Arab League isnot a matter within the scope of the 1948 Treaty.    (See paragraph 1 ofArticle 2 of the Annex to the 1948 Treaty. )1 -&apos;.        Similar considerations seem to apply to the military arrangementsmade by Jordan with Egypt, Lebanon and Syria in May 1956, and consoli-dated in a tripartite Agreement on 24th October, 1 956.    This Agreement,however, apparently relates only to a unified Command between the forcesof those States in the event of hostilit-.es, and is designed to strengthen the
defence of the A.rab States against armed attack by Israel.   In this connexion, it will be seen that on 30th October, the Foreign Secretaryreplied to a question by Mr. ^obens whether &quot;in view of the fact thatthe armed forces of Jordan, Syria and Egypt are now unified underEgyptian control&quot;, he proposed to continue the subsidy.   The answer givenwas:   &quot;The subsidy paid to Jordan by Her Majesty&apos;s Government arisesout of obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.   These obligationsare not directly affected by the decision to form a unified Command. 11The position then taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government was that thecreation of a joint Command, so far from being a serious breach of theTreaty, did not affect obligations under it by virtue of which Pier Majesty&apos;sGovernment pays the subsidy to Jordan.13. With respect to paragraph 10(a) above, it may again be difficultto identify any particular act by Jordan which could be regarded as a clear breach of paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the 1948 Treaty.    Nevertheless,the course of events does show increasing hostility by Jordan towardsKer Majesty&apos;s Government.   Farticular attention is called to theJordanian proposal of 9th November, 1956, that British representatives should be dismissed by the UNESCO Conference in New Delhi (see&apos;paper O).   J.t may be asked whether the public request for economicand political sanctions on &quot;the aggressors, Britain, France and Israel&quot;,made by the Prime Minister of Jordan on 8th December, 1956, can beregarded as consistent with the Alliance.   The same question may beasked about the statement made to the Press by the Jordanian PrimeMinister on 19th December, 1956 that his Government were urging Egypt,Syria and Saudi Arabia to disallow Canal salvage operations and to stop the flow of oil until the Israelis withdrew from the Gaza Strip and the islands in the Gulf of Aqaba.   Such actions would appear to be calculated to create difficulties for the United Kingdom.   The trouble is that it might not bepossible for the United Kingdom to rely on such actions as breaches of theTreaty before any international tribunal because Jordan mi ght be able tojustify them by reliance on the action of the United Kingdom in attackingEcypt without prior consultation with Jordan.14.        It may be that you will come to the conclusion that there isnot sufficient evidence to establish a breach of the 1948 Treaty by Jordan,but if you consider that Jordan has committed one or more breaches ofthe Treaty, it will be material to consider whether any such breach is ofa kind which gives the United. Kingdom a unilateral right to abrogate theTreaty.    In the past, there has been some difference of opinion on thequestion of international law.   One view has been that a breach of any provision of a treaty, however minor, gives a valid excuse to the other party to terminate it.    A different view, which is considered to be more inaccordance with modern practice, is that not every breach gives rise tothe right of termination.    The test which seems to be most widely accepted is whether the breach is material to the object of the treaty or,as it is sometimes put, whether the breach can be regarded as going tothe root of the treaty and not merely affecting some collateral orsubsidiary provision.    Inherently, the question is probably one to beconsidered on the interpretation of each Treaty, but the difficulty is thata unilateral right of termination must, in the absence of any decision by anarbitral or judicial tribunal, be founded on a unilateral decision whether there has been a violation and a unilateral assessment of the character of&apos;hat violation.
1?.        In the present case, it may be material that Article 6 of the1948 Treaty provides that should any difference arise reLative to itsapolication or interpretation, and should the Parties fait to settle suchdifference by direct negotiations, it shall be referred to the international court of Justice unless the 1 parties agree to another mode of settlement.The inclusion of a provision of this kind seems to run counter to the idea that either Party can have a unilateral right to condemn the other Fartyof breach of the Treaty and on that basis to terminate the Treaty byunilateral action.   The Treaty itself provides first for direct negotiations and, should they fail, for reference to the International Court.   Therefore,it may be considered that even if the doctrine of the right of unilateraltermination could be applied in the present case, this could only be so ifa clear and fundamental breach could be shown, beyond any doubt, to havebeen committed.16.        If. it can be shown that Jordan has committed one or morebreaches of the 1948 Treaty, it may be considered that any such breachhas been waived by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    Thus, after the dismissal of General Glubb and other officers, negotiations with Jordan were under-taken to agree with the Government of Jordan the conditions on which theremaining ..&quot; ritish officers should serve with the Jordanian forces.   Again,while the Jordan Government was warned against the import of Soviet arms,no such warning was given in the case of the import of arms from Egypt,and no complaint was lodred after it became known that some Sovietsmall arms had been imported.   Likewise, in the case of the Agreementwith Egypt and Syria regarding the Joint Command, no official complaint of breach was lodged, and the subsidy payable in connexion with the 1948Treaty was continued.17.        The question on which I am to seek your Opinion is whether,havinp regard to the considerations set out in this letter and theenclosures, Her ?Majesty&apos;s&apos;s Government have, at the present time, thernht to terminate the 1948 Treaty by notice to the Jordan Government.I should, in any ijvent, be grateful for your observations as to the propermethod bv which the Treaty might most conveniently be brought to an end.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   T.A.

19,56 (Cont*d,)In a statement to the Press King Hussein said &quot;weare anxious to stand by our Treaty c6mmitmentseOur relations with the ally   Britain, will continueto be maintained on the best terms.    The removal ofGlubb from the office of Chief of General Staff is alocal matter which bears no relation to the Treaty,,We shall keep British officers In the Legion asexperts and instructors&quot;.King Hussein met King Peisal of Iraq and Nuri Saidat II.h to discuss means of implementing the 1947Treaty of Brotherhood and Alliance between jordan and Iraq.Egyptian message to King Hussein expressing willing-ness of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia to extendfinancial aid to Jordan if Britain ceased to extend its annual subsidy,,    The message restricted the offer to a period of ten years at the end of which theposition would be reconsidered.King Hussein&apos;s reply repeated his willingness toaccept any financial  aid which was offered, butinsisted that it had nothing to do with Jordan&apos;relations with Great Britainr    He anticipated thatthe British subsidy would not,  in fact, be dis-continued since it was in the nature of an obligation under the An^lo-Jordan Treaty and would therefore continue as Ion;-; as the Treaty itself.The Jordan Prime Minister made a statement to thePress about the policy of his government.    Withregard to the Anglo-Jordan Treaty he said:    &quot;Onthis basis I wish to explain the Anglo-Jordanrelations within the framework of the provisions ofthe Trerty of 1948:, and to say that the recentchanges in the command of the Arab Legion were aimed at strengthening national sovereignty and safe-guarding rigilts and obligations,  and in no wayreflecting on the existing friendly relations/betweenJordan and Great Britain&quot;.Public announcement of King Hussein&apos;s intention toundertake a series of visits to all Arab countries inan attempt to unite them in face of the Israelidanger and to gain support for his proposal for ameeting of nil heads .of Arab states.A Joint Anglo-Jordan communique was issued in Ammanstating that full, frank and cordial, discussions were in progress on the position of british officers in the Legion and that  the stage had beenreached at which reference was necessary to thetwo Governments.    In general it was agreed torecommend that the number of British officers inthe Legion should be reduced to those necessaryto fill certain posts of a technical and trainingnature on term basically similar to those which had obtained hitherto.    Discussions would continue.
King Hussein and Jordan Prime Minister went toDamascus for discussions with President Kuwatlyand the Syrian Prime Minister,,    Joint communiquewas issued on -11th April dealing with measuresto promote Arab unity.    This included the state-ment that &quot;the two parties consider the arab states alone as having the right to defend them-selves, and to repulse aggression on their territories&quot;.Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Amman,  on instructions,,requested an explanation as to the bearing ofthe Damascus communique upon the Anglo-jordan treaty.    The Jordan Prime Minister insisted thatJordan relied as much as ever upon our help inthe event of aggression by Israel against Jordan;and that the communique was intended -co refer toa case where Great Britain had not been obligedto come to Jordan&apos;s aid under the Treaty becauseno direct aggression had been committed againstJordan.    Jordan nevertheless might be involved in hostilities on account of her obligation underthe Arab League Security Pact to help other arab states,  if attacked.    In general, the communiquewas intended to bring home to Arab States therealization that,   if they &quot;became involved in hostilities with&apos; Israel,  they might well have to rely upon themselves alone,,Further agreed announcement upon the Anglo-Jordantalks about the position of British officers inthe Arab Legion.    This explained that, in accord-ance with their Treaty obligation to provideservice  personnel required by Jordan   her majesty&apos;s Government hod undertaken to continuethe loan of certain officers in specified appoint-ments0    While the officers would continue towear the Arab Legion uniform, they would retain their full rights and responsibilities withregard to their service in the British Array underthe Army Act.    Conditions of service were to be mutually agreed.The Jordan Government decided to dismissColonels Melville and Cruiekshank from the ArabLegion liaison office in London when their contracts expired.    It had been understood in earlier discussions that these officers would both be retained.Jordan Military Delegation, headed by theJordanian Chief of General Staff, arrived in cairo for military talks.

1st January, 1957Dear Vallat,The Solicitor-General and I have carefully consideredyour letter of the 28th December about the right of KerMajesty&apos;s Government to terminate the 19U8 Treaty of alliance with Jordan &quot;by unilateral action.    Gn the information supplied to us we have come to the conclusion that no such righthas accrued.We agree that the rebus sic stantihus. principle has no application and that Jordan has not repudiated the Treaty.The Treaty was expressed to he without prejudice toJordan&apos;s rights and obligations under the Charter of theUnited Nations and the Covenant of the League of Arab Statesof 19-1-5.    In 1952 Jordan subscribed, without objection by her Majesty&quot;s Government, to the Treaty cf Joint Defence andEcoiiomic Co-operation &quot;between Arab League States cf 1950.It would accordingly be most difficult to contend successfullythat action taken in accordance with the provisions of theCovenant or of the 1950 Treaty amounted to a breach of theTreaty of 19hS.In our opinion, if, prior to tne cease fire on the6th November, Jordan was guilty of a broach or breaches ofthe- 19^+3 Treaty those breaches were not of such a character as to justify unilateral termination of thet Treaty.After the ceasefire a cable was sent on the 9thNovember by Jordan to UNEOCO.    The statement that the telegram was not properly authorised has boo-n tacitly   acceptedby Her Majescy&apos;s Government and the contents of the telegramcarmct now,  in our view, be regarded as justifying unilateraltermination.The statement of the Jordan Government&apos;s policyrrade on the 27th November disclosed an intention net to repudiatebut to seek the termination of the 1 9h8 Treaty.    This stato-ment cannot justify unilateral termination.On the 8th December the Jordan Prime Minister called for economic sanctions on the aggressors, inducing the UnitedKingdom.These actions on the 9th and 27th November and the8th December are referable to the action taken by ourselves in attacking Egypt, which might be regarded by an international tribunal as^a breach by the United Kingdom of Article 1  ofthe I9h8 Treaty,  the very article on which wo should be seeking to rely if we purported to abrogate the Treaty onaccount of the acts above referred to.    On the 11th Decemberan instalment of the subsidy -was paid and if Jordan wishedto resist toimination of the 19I+8 Treaty she would no doubtcontend chat by making that payment Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwaived any breaches of the Treaty committed   by her before that date.
We are informed that on the 19th December the PrimeMinister of Jordan told the Press that his Government wereurging Egypt,  Syria and Saudi Arabia to disallow Canal .salvageoperations and to stop the flew of oil until the Israelis w&apos;ith-drew from the Gaza Strip and the islands in the   Gulf ofAqaba.    If this statement amounted to adopting an attitudecontrary to Article 1  of the *9U8 Treaty,  it may be asserted thJordan was entitled to take this course by virtue of theCovenant of the Arab League and the Treaty of Joint Defenceof 1950,In our opinion it is net possible to establish any suchbroach by Jordan of the i91+8 Treaty either before or afterthe cease fire on the 6th November as would justify unilateraltermination.Further, Article 6 of the 1 9U&amp; Treaty provides that any difference relating to the application or interpretation of the Treaty should,  if not otherwise settled, be referredto the International Court of Justice.    If Her Majesty&apos;s.Government sought to terminate the Treaty unilaterally andthis matter came before the International Court of Justiceit would seem inevitable that the proceedings would raisethe question whether wo had broken Article 1 of the 191+81&apos;treaty before any of the alleged breaches by the jordan government and would so involve consideration of the legality of our action in attacking Egypt.In your letter y. u also asked us to advise as to theproper method by which the Treaty might meat conveniently be brought to an end.    As, for the reasons given, we cannot recommend a reference to the International Court or to anyother international tribunal there  remains only the possibilityof terminating the Treaty by agreement.    It is not for usto advise how negotiations to that end can best be initiatedand conducted but it might be helpful to you if I indicatethat there do not appear to us to be any legal objectionsto a formal request being made to the Jordan Government forinformation whether they propose to seek to enter into negotiations to terminate the Treaty as stated en the29th November and if so,  for their proposals.    We understandthat there is no definite agreement as to the date of pay-niunt of instalments of the subsidy and we do net thereforethink there could he any objection on legal grounds ifthe request specified, the time within which a positiveanswer v/as required and included a statement that payment ofthe monthly instalment would be  suspended pending receiptof tho answer.Yours sincerely,( Si gne d) REGINALD MANNINGHAM-BULLERP.
