THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT31Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1956SECRET Copy No.    54CP. (56) 2597th November, 1956CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS DISQUALIFICATION bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs on 8th February the Cabinet agreed that the House of commons disqualification Bill should go to a Select Committee (CM. (56) 9th Conclusions,Minute 4). The Committee reported the Bill with amendments on 26th July(Bill 167) and submitted a Special Report (H. of C. 1956 No. 349) on the same date. On 1st August the Lord Privy Seal informed the House (Col. 1405) that itwould be necessary to see when the Bill could be fitted in, and that &quot; we shouldnot lose much more time in dealing with it.&quot; My officials have since consulted all departments on the Report and many points of detail have been raised.2.   I now invite my colleagues to consider (i) three questions of policy which arise on the Report and the amended Bill;(ii) the action to be taken on the numerous points of detail which have been raised.&quot; Reverse disqualification &quot;3. The first question of principle for our consideration arises on paragraph 4of the Select Committee&apos;s report, viz. &quot; whether it would be preferable to substitute the principle of disqualifyinga member of the House of Commons from holding any of the specified offices for the principle that the specified offices should disqualify from membership of the House of Commons.&quot;Those who favour a &quot; reverse disqualification &quot; Bill on the lines of Appendix 1to the Committee&apos;s report have argued that the House is our most important national institution and that the &quot; reverse &quot; method avoids elevating the holding of a disqualifying office above membership of the House. The contrary argumentis that the &quot;reverse&quot; method woud apparently withdraw from the House itspresent jurisdiction to decide questions of disqualification because the only issue which could arise in future would be whether a person, admittedly a member ofthe House, was entitled to hold some other office. That issue, if litigable at all,would be decided by the Courts, and the House could not be given a power (onthe lines of Clause 6(2) of the amended Bill) to waive the consequences of aninadvertent disqualification. On these latter grounds I recommend acceptanceof the majority view of the Committee.Principal amendments made by the Select committee . The amended Bill differs in the following important respects from theversion introduced last year (i) the general disqualification of holders of all &quot; paid offices or places underthe Crown&quot; has been replaced by comprehensive lists of individualdisqualifying offices; provision is made in Clause 5 for adding to theselists, by Order in Council, any new offices created in the future otherwise&apos;   : than by Statute;50745
(ii) members of the reserve and auxiliary forces will no longer be disqualified, i on embodiment or recall to the Colours; - .(iii) the existing - disqualifications of Government contractors and Grownpensioners are repealed without replacement.5. The listing of disqualifying offices is a very much clearer and simplermethod of legislating which should materially reduce the incidence of doubts andof inadvertent disqualifications.&apos; But it,may be disliked by the constitutionalpurists, on the ground that it will leave the Government of the day free to use newnon-statutory sinecure posts for the purpose of patronage without risk of the holders being disqualified. This is because the Government for the time beingwiiriiii practice be able to settle what additions should be made to the list bymeans of Orders in Council under the new Clause 5. The simple answer to all this seems to be that patronage would scarcely be practicable under the modernparty system.6. Almost all whole-time service in the Forces would have led todisqualification under the original Bill; the only exceptions would have been periods of training of up to three months&apos; duration. Logically this was defensible, because there are obvious and fundamental reasons why no whole-time Crown servant(whether military or civil) should be able freely and openly to voice opinions on government policy. The Service Departments&apos; witnesses assured the SelectCommittee, however, that in peacetime sitting Members would not in practice becalled up for such periods as would disqualify them. I have no doubt that theCommittee attached importance to this evidence and also to the inconvenience tothe House of losing a number of its Members through call-up in the early stages ofa war emergency. I accordingly see no reason to dissent from the Committee&apos;recommendation.7. SOme sections of the press have criticised the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions that existing disqualifications of Government contractors should be repealed.This course, however, was regarded by the Select Committee as the only practicable alternative to retaining the archaisms and anomalies of the present law, and i recommend that we should adopt it. Ipropose that we should also accept theirsuggestion that the rules and practice of the House governing disclosure of personalpecuniary interests when speaking or voting should be reconsidered.The Effect of Clause 1(4)8. Departmental comments on the amended Bill have disclosed someuneasiness about the effect of Clause 1(4), part of which provides that &quot; a person shall not be disqualified for appointment to or for holding any office or place by reason of his being a member of that House.&quot;The main purpose of these words is to found the repeals, effected by the fourth schedule, of the various &quot; reverse disqualifications &quot; now on the Statute Book.They would also prevent the future creation of new reverse disqualifications bymeans of prerogative or statutory instruments (cf. paragraph 6 of the british transport Commission (Organisation) Scheme Order, 1954). It has been suggested,however, that the. sub-section goes further than this, and that it might embarrassMinisters whose policy is that persons closely identified with party politics shouldnot hold certain offices. The argument is that such a policy might be ultra viresin so far as it operated to exclude sitting Members from posts not for the time beingscheduled as disqualifying offices. This might cause particular difficulty to theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance as I understand there are some15,000 posts on the various tribunals and other adjudicating bodies under social security legislation.9. Whatever may be the strict law of the matter, there is obviously animportant question of principle involved. It seems to me that Ministers might beopen to severe criticism if they took it upon themselves, by administrative action, to exclude sitting Members from posts which the Select Committee considered butregarded as not incompatible with membership of the House. As the committee did not take oral evidence from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurancetheir decisions on National Insurance tribunals, &amp;c, may well have been reached on the basis of incomplete information. I suggest, therefore, that in these and any similar cases it would be more appropriate to seek the amendment of. the first schedule than to take administrative measures to exclude Members from offices
not now listed there. In particular I think it might be very unwise to amendClause 1(4) so as to facilitate such measures; the amendment could hardly be explained away as &quot; drafting,&quot; and&apos;if its true purpose were explained we might be accused of circumventing the Select Committee?s&apos; re&apos;commendationsvn -&apos;&quot;&apos;Future Action rb-Hy,&apos; $xihikhpi10.   Examination of the Select Committee&apos;s Report, and of the amended Bill,has thrown lip a&apos;host of detailed points, to&apos;cover which I foresee the need forsome 50-60 amendments. About 40 of them, howeVer, including-^   &apos;   &apos;;JiJJ.^or;8 covering recent abolitions of old offices, creations Of, hew ones or changes of nomenclature; ,74 necessitated by Consolidation Acts;10 relating to offices which had hitherto been overlooked; and16 designed to clarify or simplify what is already in the Bill;should be quite uncontentious. I suggest, therefore, that We must now settle two matters. The first is one of principle, namely, whether we should seek any further amendment of the Bill; secondly there is the question of tactics, namely, whetheror not to amend before reintroduction. It would seem manifestly wrong to allow the Bill to pass into law without bringing it fully up to date and dealing with theactual errors and doubts now known to us. An appreciable number of correctiveamendments will thus be inevitable, and in view of this I suggest that we can reasonably leave it to the Legislation Committee to settle what others, possiblyof a more controversial nature, should be moved (including any arising from mysuggestion in paragraph 9 above).11. Turning to the question of tactics I strongly recommend that we shouldnot amend the Bill before reintroduction. In their evidence before the SelectCommittee my officials emphasised that I had no Departmental responsibility forthe Bill. It is, indeed, House of Commons business rather than a government measure; in view of this and of the exhaustive consideration and amendmentundertaken by the Select Committee there is much to be said for leaving anyfurther amendment to the House as a whole. I accordingly propose that the Billshould be reintroduced exactly as reported by the Select Committee. Apart fromits constitutional propriety, this course would have the advantage of enabling usto press on without waiting to clear up all the points of detail. It would also help to simplify the Second Reading stage (which might otherwise develop into atedious explanation of the changes we had made before reintroduction). Theonly drawback is that a certain amount of time would be taken up in Committeeon the Floor of the House; but I think the figures in the previous paragraph showthat this need not be very great. :. ...Summary12.   I ask the Cabinet (a) to accept the majority view of the Select Committee that a &quot;reversedisqualification&quot; Bill would not be satisfactory (paragraph 3);(b) to approve in principle the main changes in the Bill made by the SelectCommittee (paragraphs 4 to 7) and to accept their proposal that therules and practice of the House in regard to disclosure of personalpecuniary interests should be reconsidered (paragraph 7);(c) to agree that Clause 1(4) should be retained, and that administrative measures to exclude sitting Members from non-disqualifying postswould be inappropriate (paragraphs 8 and 9);(d) to authorise the reintroduction of the Bill, early in the 1956-57 Session,in the exact terms in which it was reported by the Select Committee.    (paragraph 11); .. ..(e) to invite the Legislation Committee to consider what amendments to theBill would later be justified (paragraph 10). ---!-&apos;.ay ^frfe^-m v.--y - - LL.-G. ,&quot;Home Office, S.W.1,6th November, 1956.
