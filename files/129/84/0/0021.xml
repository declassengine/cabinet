I can now report that in letters I was able to publish,Sir James Turner said, on behalf of the three Farmers&apos; Unions for Englandand Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland -COPY NO. 52/(i)   in regard to the long-term assurances and the farm improvement Scheme -&quot;I have pleasure in confirming that the revised arrangements for the guarantee structure and the broadprinciple of the capital imporvement scheme are agreed to bythe three Unions.   We welcome these proposals as providing,through longer term assurances, a sound and satisfactory basis for future confidence and the necessary forward planning in theindustry. &quot;(ii)   In regard to special reviews -&quot;I should like to express our satisfaction with thedecision to maintain the legislative provision for holdingspecial reviews and to confirm our acceptance of the new arrangements. &quot;3. This has helped considerably in putting over the new proposals.They have so far been very well received throughout the agricultural industry; and without undue criticism more generally.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.W.1,30th November, 1956
