THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF*HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1956SECRET Cbpy No.   6 4CP. (56) 2566th November, 1956CABINETA MUTUAL FREE TRADE AREA WITH europe memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President ofthe Board of trade we were authorised by the Cabinet in September to explain and discuss theproposals in Plan G with Commonwealth Finance Ministers during the meetings in Washington; it was agreed that a decision could not be taken until there hadbeen further opportunity for reflection and until the views of the Commonwealthwere more adequately known (CM. (56) 66th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. It was subsequently agreed that we should indicate at a Press conference the general nature of the ideas that were being discussed with the Commonwealth,emphasising that the Government had not arrived at a conclusion in this matter.The Press conference was held on 3rd October.3. The reaction of public opinion in this country has been fully as favourableas we had hoped. A satisfactory body of support has emerged in the Press and among all sections of political opinion. The views of industry are, and will nodoubt remain, divided; but there is support even in industries likely to suffer, andover industry as a whole it seems likely that the weight of opinion will be in favour the results of the Federation of British Industries Survey confirm the Board ofTrade&apos;s direct evidence. Opinion in the Trades Union Congress appears to becautious but not ill-disposed; we were impressed by their sober and realisticattitude in our discussions with them. The Economic Planning Board has been consulted; the members were aware of the difficulties, but were generally of theopinion that it would be right to go forward.4. Certainly in the course of the next few weeks opposition will develop froma number of quarters, but we can reasonably expect that this opposition will bein the nature of an attack from particular interests which might fear damage fromthe Plan rather than a broadly-based political criticism of the whole conception.5. The external reaction has been much the same as had been expected. Thevarious views which have been expressed are summarised in Annex II. There hasbeen a considerable welcome from Europe, but they are not yet certain whether we are flying a kite or whether we mean business. We have had no definite viewfrom the United States Government, but in his Miami speech on 29th October,President Eisenhower spoke with warmth of this &quot; challenging idea &quot;; fears will undoubtedly emerge that American commercial interests will suffer, and that wemay be abandoning the principles of multilateral trade, but the Presidents firstreaction and the fact that he thought fit to include it in an election speech isencouraging.6. The attitude of the Commonwealth Governments is now reasonably clear.Canada has not yet replied officially, but the indications which we have so farreceived (paragraph 7 of Annex II) suggest that Canada is unlikely to oppose thePlan in principle. Australia and New Zealand have expressed appreciation of the considerations that commend the Plan to the United Kingdom; they make50737 b
reservations on particular points, but do not dissent from the basic concept of thePlan. The attitude of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is similar. Wedo not expect dissent from South Africa.- India has expressed general support forthe Plan; Pakistan and Ceylon do not appear to consider themselves greatlyaffected. There will of course be problems of adjustment with individualC6&apos;himdnwearth Governments as has always been recognised, but we think it can reasonably be concluded that the Commonwealth as a whole is not opposed to ourgoing forward.7. The reactions of the Colonies have been in general accordance with the expectation that their interests would not be seriously affected, on the assumptionsthat the free trade area would exclude food and that the Europeans&apos; overseas territories would not be included. This is satisfactory enough; but the French areadducing powerful arguments for bringing their overseas territories into the MessinaCustoms Union; this would in turn lead to strong arguments for their inclusion like-wise in the free trade area; this could in turn lead to important considerations forsome of the Colonies. It is too early to take a view about this complex; but we see no reason to doubt that we shall be able in negotiation effectively to protect theColonies&apos; essential interests. We must ensure, however, that we keep the colonies in close touch with the proceedings.8. In our judgment the reception of the Plan, both at home and by theGovernments concerned, has been favourable enough to justify a further step forward; and that step should be taken now. The time has come at which,for effective action in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.), we must state our position more definitely. The longer we delay, themore scope there is for difficulties and misunderstandings to develop, both inEurope and elsewhere. There is real danger that positions may become establishedwhich would be difficult to change in subsequent negotiations and which might even prejudice the possibility of bringing into being an acceptable scheme.9. The next step would be a public announcement of Her Majesty&apos;governments desire to enter into negotiations in O.E.E.C. with the purpose ofestablishing, on acceptable terms, a mutual free trade area (excluding foodstuffs)in Europe, on the lines indicated in Annex I (the aide-memoire given to Common-wealth Finance Ministers). If our colleagues agree, this announcement would bemade to Parliament at the opening of a debate, if possible in the week beginning19th November. We should at the same time inform the Commonwealth andO.E.E.C. Governments.10. This announcement would lead to a continuous process of negotiation,which would take place over a considerable period. During this period we shouldbe continuing to consult industry at home, and we should be continuously informingand consulting the Commonwealth and the Colonies. The final decision couldnot be made until the end of the negotiations, for only then shall we be able tosee what terms can be obtained and to judge whether the resulting plan is acceptable.11. The first crucial stage in this process of negotiation would probably bea meeting of the O.E.E.C. Ministerial Council early in 1957, which would receive a report from the officials&apos; working party now in session, take stock, and decide how to proceed.12. At the Ministerial Council we should seek to get agreement on all ourfundamental points the issues on which we should break. We would expect a major difficulty to be the exclusion of foodstuffs very few Governments in Europewant free trade in foodstuffs, but there is reluctance to admit this formally. Thepoint is so fundamental that it would be wise, in our view, to make clear from the outset that we are prepared to enter negotiations only on that basis. We should expect this condition to be ultimately accepted.13.   The other chief problems would be:  (i) the order and pattern of tariff reduction, and the related problems ofescape clauses and arrangements for management;(ii) the overseas territories;(iii) the demand of France for special, treatment (particularly the idea of a&quot; trial period &quot;); we shall have to be prepared to take a very firm line with the French (and to induce the others to do so) in order to preventthe whole scheme from being whittled away.
14. From this point the negotiation would continue, with periodic Ministerialmeetings to seek to resolve difficulties. If the negotiation succeeded, there would follow a period for drafting the appropriate instrument and its ratification by the parliaments. The whole process would probably require 18-24 months. It seems that the effective operation of the Plan would, at earliest, start about the end of1958-and the Mutual Free Trade Area come into full existence in the early1970&apos;s. .   :15.   We therefore ask our colleagues&apos;approval:  (a) to announce in Parliament Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ intention to enterinto negotiations in O.E.E.C. with the purpose of establishing, onacceptable terms, a mutual free trade area in Europe (excludingfoodstuffs) on the lines indicated in Annex I;(b) to proceed subsequently, in consultation with other Ministers concerned,on the general lines indicated in paragraphs 10-14 above, keeping theCommonwealth and Colonial Governments fully informed throughout,and reporting to our colleagues as necessary.H. M.P. T.5 th November, 1956.ANNEX IAIDE-MEMOIRE GIVEN TO COMMONWEALTH FINANCE MINISTERS29th September, 1956The United Kingdom would enter a partial Free Trade Area with theCustoms Union of the Messina Six (Benelux, France, Germany, Italy) and all other.E.E.C. countries that wished to join (probably Norway, Sweden, Denmark,Switzerland, Austria).2. We would not expect the Free Trade Area to include dependent territories of any of the members, but this would remain uncertain until we found Europeanreactions to our main proposals, and their views on this question; in the meantime,we are consulting our own Colonial territories on their possible interest.3. The Free Trade Area would cover all commodities without exceptionexcept foodstuffs (denned broadly to include not only raw food but alsomanufactured foods, feedingstuffs, drink and tobacco). The exclusion of foodstuffsis an essential condition on which we should insist without qualification, both inthe interests of home agricultural policy and in the interests of the Commonwealth.4. Within the Free Trade Area, tariffs (except revenue tariffs in the strictsense), protective quotas and other protective devices (e.g., export taxes andcontrols, export subsidies) would be reduced and ultimately abolished in definedstages over a period of about a decade.5. We should retain our existing freedom of action in our tariffs on importsfrom the rest of the world, subject to our commitments in the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and elsewhere; this is the essential differencebetween a Free Trade Area and a Customs Union, We should remain free tocontinue to give free entry to Commonwealth goods. The preferences providedby our tariff against imports from foreign countries outside Europe would beunaffected. .6. We should insist that there should be ho discrimination by the MessinaSix in each other&apos;s favour and against us. This implies the same time-table fortariff reduction throughout the whole Free Trade Area.     -50737 &apos; &apos;:L 1&quot;;:    &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; B 2
7. We should retain the right under existing rules to impose quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons to protect sterling. The area would be working under the present G.A.T.T. and O.E.E.C. rules unless it were decided thatstricter rules should be applied by members.. 8. The proposals would be entirely consistent with the collective approach tofreer trade and payments, and to convertibility; they would represent one step forward towards the world-wide reduction of trade barriers. The size of the free trade Area and the extent of its extra-European interests would ensure that it didnot develop into an inward-looking regional bloc. We should aim to continue theprogress which we have made in recent years in reducing and removing quota restrictions on imports from Canada and the United States.9. The international management of the Free Trade Area might be conducted in O.E.E.C. by a &quot; Managing Board &quot; (at Ministerial and official level), consistingonly of the members of the area, operating under Article 14 of the O.E.E.C.constitution. This Article enables a group to proceed without the positive assent of non-members of the group (provided they agree to this course).ANNEX IIREACTIONS IN COMMONWEALTH AND OTHER countries. Governments of Member Countries of the commonwealth the general ideas of the mutual free trade area were explained at the meetingof Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Washington at the end of September.They gave these proposals a sympathetic hearing and undertook to let us have their considered reactions as soon as possible. We stressed the need for Common-wealth reactions to be available to us by the end of October because of the timetableof events in the O.E.E.C. Working Party. A further message was sent on.19th October to United Kingdom High Commissioners telling them that we should like to avoid giving other Commonwealth Governments a fixed date by which to comment, but that we should in fact need other Commonwealth Governments&apos;views by the end of October. The message accordingly instructed high commissioners to make it clear that the United Kingdom Government would haveto make up their minds on this issue by the beginning of November at the latestif the initiative were not to be lost, and to convey the hope that other Common-wealth Governments&apos; comments would be sent very soon.2. We have now received views from four Commonwealth Governments,namely, Australia, New Zealand, India and the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.3. The reply of the Australian Government supports the United KingdomGovernmenfs proposal to have &quot; preliminary discussions &quot; in the O.E.E.C. Itwelcomes the United Kingdom Governmenfs intention of seeking arrangements which will be compatible with the collective approach to free trade and payments and which will not result in the introduction of new barriers against the trade ofother countries. The Australian Government say that they are reassured by theUnited Kingdom Governmenfs intention of not associating with a free trade area in respect of food, including manufactured food, feedingstuffs, drink and tobacco.They wish to be fully consulted on the details of any proposals before the UnitedKingdom Government takes any decision to associate with the free trade area.They express particular interest in the position of dependent territories in relationto the proposed free trade area. In the course of the current Australian trade negotiations with the United Kingdom in London the Australian delegation have indicated that they would wish to write into the agreement the waivers whichthe United Kingdom would require in order to enter a free trade area, and thatthey would want those waivers to exclude agriculture. -   -4. The New Zealand Government say that they recognise why the UnitedKingdom might wish to take this step but are particularly concerned that theproposals should involve no avoidable encroachment on the existing system of
Commonwealth preference in the United Kingdom. They also hope that the definition of excluded items could be extended to cover the widest possible range ofagricultural products, and express anxiety at the disadvantages of New zealand in competing, for example, with Denmark for trade in dairy products in othercountries of a European free trade area.5. The Government of India expresses sympathy with the present approach of the United Kingdom and general support of the free trade area proposal, on theunderstanding that it is a step in the direction of freer trade and payments generally.They express:  . .(i) hope that the proposal will help to create conditions favourable to alarger flow of capital to less developed areas; &quot;  -*(ii) hope that the Commonwealth Preference system will not be so disturbedas to require general revision;(iii) anxiety about the possible inclusion of dependent overseas territories;(iv) concern lest the creation of the. free trade area should be accompanied bya raising of the external tariffs of European member countries, as wellas affecting adversely some of India&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom.They also suggest that an early approach to G.A.T.T. is desirable.6. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, though they make certainreservations, have indicated that they have no objection in principle to our goingforward. The inclusion of tobacco is of great importance to them, and if dependentoverseas territories were included in a free trade area it would present them with considerable difficulties.7. We have had some indication from the Acting United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Ottawa about the views which the Canadian Government arelikely to express. It appears that these views may be favourable. The ActingUnited Kingdom High Commissioner has reported that the Canadians have been impressed with the favourable reception which the proposals have had so far inthe United Kingdom and that the general concensus of opinion among Canadianofficials is well disposed. They are likely, however, to seek, an assurance of our intention to continue with the removal of discriminatory quota restrictions againstdollar goods, and they are also likely to refer to the need for inter-Goveramentdiscussions to review the Ottawa Agreements and the 1947 Geneva Exchange of letters. They are not likely to mention what is the most important politicalproblem which they will face domestically, namely the possibility that the proposedfree trade area might increase existing pressures on Canada towards closer trade relations with, and general dependence on, the United States.8. Among those Governments which have not replied formally, the PakistanFinance Minister has indicated that his Government do not consider their country would be adversely affected. The Ceylon Finance Minister, at the time of themeeting in Washington late last month, stated that Ceylon would not be directly affected by these proposals. He has since confirmed that he supports our proposals and will recommend accordingly to his Prime Minister. There is no authoritativeindication of the South African views, though at official level we are told that theSouth African Government are not likely to raise serious objections.II. Colonial Governments9. Preliminary reactions have been obtained from the majority of the largertrading territories and territories likely to be particularly interested in the proposals.None of the Governments concerned objects in principle to United Kingdomparticipation (though the Federation of Malaya has asked for certain assurances,as described below). In some cases their attitude on whether they would themselveswish to participate might well depend on whether overseas territories of any othercountries were to be included.10. Cyprus, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Trinidad, Kenya and Ugandahave indicated that they would not themselves wish to participate.11. Hong Kong and Singapore would like to see dependent overseas territories (including themselves) participate.12. Jamaica, Kenya and Tanganyika think that dependent overseas territories should be excluded; in particular Kenya and Tanganyika fear that the inclusion of
European dependent overseas territories would attach a considerable part of Africanorth of the Union of South Africa to a European free market for items other thanfood. Such a move would, in their view, be open to the criticism that itdisregarded in Africa the geographical considerations which are the basis of thefree market proposals in Europe, the African territories being included for politicaland not geographical reasons.13J &apos; The Federation of Malaya asks for three assurances as follows:  (a) That the proposals would not lead to any departure from the, UnitedKingdom &quot; free entry &quot; or &quot; low tariff &quot; policy towards imports from malaya.(b). That no modification in any import duties affecting Federation productswould be decided without previous consultation.(c) That the United Kingdom would try to ensure that European tariffs onMalayan products were kept at the lowest practical levels and that increases or new duties were not introduced for protection ofcompetitive industries.14. These views do not reflect any discussion with local trade interests.Colonial Governments have since been authorised to engage in such consultation as they think necessary. The views of those Governments not originally consultedhave also been asked for. It is not expected that any further general expression of colonial opinion will be received for some time.Ill-United States15. The proposals have been explained to United States officials both inLondon and Washington. No official reaction has yet been obtained. the reception in the United States Press has on the whole been sympathetic. In a campaign speech at Miami on 29th October President Eisenhower made favourablereferences to the proposals both for a Six-Power Customs Union and for a free trade area. He is reported to have said:  &apos; &quot; Nothing has been more heartening than the recent announcement oftwo new proposals that would advance further the economic integration ofEurope. The first is the concept that six Western European countries mightestablish a common market.&quot;In this internal barriers to trade would be completely eliminated asthey are within the United States. The second is the challenging idea that thereafter Great Britain, in association with other countries on the EuropeanContinent, might gradually establish a free trade area around the common market.&quot; We shall watch these exciting new developments with the keenestinterest. They could lead to a substantial rise in the productive capabilitiesof these European countries and make possible more efficient use of theirphysical and human resources.&quot; As Europe grows stronger economically we gain in every way.&quot;IV. European Opinion16. The statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 3rd Octoberaroused wide interest. The general feeling appears to be that a decision by theUnited Kingdom to enter a free trade area would be a major, and welcome,departure in United Kingdom policy. Of the preliminary official comment sofar reported by Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives in O.E.E.C. countries, none has beenunfavourable, although the French, Swiss, Portuguese and Danish attitude hasbeen non-committal. The political advantages have been noted in particular by german and French politicians, by M. Bech in Luxembourg, by M. Spaak himself in Belgium, and by M. Jean Monnet, President of the Action Committee for theUnited States of Europe. M. Mollet referred to the Chancellor^ statement in a speech in the French Assembly and expressed confidence that as soon as theCustoms Union was set up Great Britain would establish close links with it.17. A number of Continental newspapers, notably the French, haveexpressed scepticism about the motives behind the Chancellor^ statement. Onthe other hand, from no country has substantial opposition to the idea of a free trade Area been reported.
18. No considered views. have yet been expressed on the Chancellor^statement that agricultural products should be excluded from the scope of a free trade area. There has, however, been some criticism of the United kingdom for taking up a definite position on this point in advance of negotiations. Initialreactions in Denmark, France, Italy and the Netherlands to the proposed exclusion of agriculture have been doubtful or hostile, although Danish officials haveshgwnsome disposition to recognise that agriculture will have to be excluded. Officialsrepresenting Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal have expressed sympathy withthe United Kingdom position. Fundamentally the difference between her majesty&apos;s Government and those Governments which are likely to maintain thatagriculture ought to be included in the scope of a free trade area seems to be oneof form rather than substance, in that none of them (except perhaps. Denmark)would welcome a complete free market without special arrangements foragricultural products. But it will be difficult for them to accept that agriculture ahould be formally excluded. They apparently hope, while abolishing agriculturaltariffs, to control the market in agricultural commodities by various forms of quantitative regulation and price-fixing agreement.V. Brussels Conference19. The recent meetings have been concerned mainly with the Frenchreservations. The French said that their ability to put any such scheme into effect would depend on the outcome of the operation in Algeria. Apart from this,France is urging that:  (a) Only the first stage of tariff reduction should be a firm commitment.Progress thereafter would depend on agreement that the first stage hadbeen satisfactory.(b) Harmonisation of social charges, wages and working conditions should beundertaken during the first stage.(c) Overseas territories should be associated with the Customs Union, thoughon terms which would enable them to continue protection.20. The Foreign Ministers met on 20th-21st October. Early reports of themeeting suggested that something very near a breakdown in the negotiations had occurred. Later versions showed, however, that compromises were produced on anumber of points, even though final agreement could not be reached. On theGerman side, there was unwillingness to accept French proposals forharmonisation of wages, with particular reference to the length of the working weekand overtime, combined with opposition to the proposed monopoly provisions ofEURATOM. The German Government are still in fact torn between the politicalappeal of Six-Power integration and their own objections to accommodating theFrench unduly in the Customs Union (which otherwise has great attractions forthem), while accepting restrictions on the free development of German atomicindustry. The French, on the other hand, the closer they come to the point of decision, are the more concerned to secure all possible safeguards to make theirentry into a Customs Union a relatively painless operation.21. At this stage the outstanding points include, in addition to wage questions,the arrangements for proceeding from the first stage of the transition period to thesecond stage. These problems are now to be given further consideration. Anothermeeting of the Six Ministers may take place towards the middle of November.The French Government is to ask the French Assembly to debate the customs union as soon as the essentials of a treaty have emerged.
