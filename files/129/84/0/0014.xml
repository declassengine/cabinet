COVERING NOTEI have the honour to present to you my recommendations for a newConstitution for Cyprus. I have drawn them up in the form of a singlecontinuous document instead of expressing them in a series of separaterecommendations and I hope therefore that they will be capable of speakingfor themselves to those who read the document as a whole. At the sametime I think it desirable that I should preface them with a brief commentaryindicating what have presented themselves to me as the main features ofmy proposals and the reasons why I have preferred them to other possiblearrangements which were proposed to me or which suggested themselvesduring the course of my work.2. I am not attempting in this to present to you a formal Report. Theconditions under which I have done my work and the general desire thatI should make my proposals available within as short a space of time as circumstances allowed would have made that impossible, even if I thoughtthat a comprehensive survey of the Cyprus problem could add much to whatis already known and has been often said about its several intractable elements.My recommendations are, in effect, the best Report that I can&quot; make.3. There are one or two preliminary points that I ought to make clear,so that my proposals should not be in danger of being considered in a settingin which I have not intended to place them. The first point is that, though,as requested, I have used all speed in bringing my proposals forward, I havenot assumed that the Constitution they envisaged could be put into operation in Cyprus as it is to-day. It is a Constitution appropriate to a state of affairs in which men may express their will by voting and their views by speakingwithout fear of terrorism or intimidation: in which, on the other hand,Government does not have to impose or maintain those emergency measures,distorting ordinary life, which are the unavoidable counterpart of terrorismitself. In other words, my proposals contemplate a Cyprus in which it hasbeen possible to declare that the present emergency has come to an end.I have no views as to when that time may come. Organised murder and violence have thrown a shadow over the Island which will only lift withthe goodwill of many people. But it is possible to hope that the prospectof a Constitution with its fruitful possibilities of peaceful self-governmentmay do something to bring nearer the end of the emergency itself.4. The other point is that the Constitution which I am dealing withis the Constitution of a territory which is under the sovereignty of her majesty The Queen that, in fact, is what is laid down in the first of myTerms of Reference. It is not therefore within the province of such a constitution to provide for or to provide against the possibility of a changein the international status of Cyprus or to prescribe conditions or guaranteesattendant upon the occurrence of such an event. On the contrary, I thinkit plain law that there is no power in the Legislature of a self-governingdependency to change the status of the territory by union under a differentsovereign. Acts or resolutions directed to such a purpose would be null.If such changes were to come about, they would have to come about byother means and by instruments designed for the purpose. The constitution as to which I am to make proposals is not one of them and I do not refer to the matter further.
5. It is convenient that at this stage I should set out in full my ter^\of. reference which you communicated to me on the 12th day of September \aM?&quot;To make recommendations as to the form of a new Constitution forCyprus which shall be consistent with the following requirements: -(a) that during the period of the Constitution Cyprus is to remain under british sovereignty;,- (/;) that the use of Cyprus as a base is necessary for the fulfilment by her Majesty&apos;s Government of their international obligations and forthe defence of British interests in the Middle East and of the interestsof other Powers allied or associated with the United; Kingdom;(c) that all matters relating to external affairs, defence, and internal security are retained in the hands of Her Majesty&apos;s Government orthe Governor;(d) that, subject to this, the Constitution is to be based on the principlesof liberal democracy and is to confer a wide measure of responsibleself-government on elected representatives of the people of Cyprus,but is at the same time to contain such reservations, provisions and guarantees as may be necessary to give a just protection to the special interests of the various communities, religions and races in the island.&quot;6. I have not thought it my duty under this Commission to present toyou as my proposals a draft of the complete instrument or instruments whichwould be needed to bring a Constitution into immediate operation. It wouldbe premature to do so, anyway; but, apart from that, I know by experiencethat the niceties of legal phrasing and the accumulation of details which,though necessary, are not illuminating, tend to obscure for the reader the true purport of the whole scheme. What matters at this stage is the generaloutline, and it has throughout been my wish to keep that general outline asclear and simple as possible. My proposals are therefore to be read asinstructions for a draftsman, not as a draft itself. I am afraid that in theresult I cannot put them forward as being simple, because the complexity of the various interests that have to be recognised and provided for doespreclude simplicity. A diarchy itself, such as results from the reservation of certain powers, is a complicated conception. But I hope that I have founda form of expression which is reasonably clear. For that purpose I haveavoided technical language as far as I can, I have been explicit at pointswhere much past experience suggests that it might nevertheless be wiser to substitute vagueness for precision and, though my draft has in the end become a great deal more detailed than at the beginning I hoped to find necessary,it does, I think, include everything that a reader, having appreciated the mainideas, would wish to know by way of detail in order to see how they are intended to be applied.7. In constitutional proposals it is usual that two conflicting influencesshould weigh against each other. On the one hand there is the natural desireto define terms and to express meticulously the powers and limitationsproposed; On the other hand, it is well to recognise that a WrittenConstitution is no moire&apos; than a legal framework for a political body inWhich there is inherent the capacity of: growth and development. 1 Fromthe latter point of view too rigid a formulation is a positive mischance; Irccogh.se this, and indeed it is hardly necessary to say that no Constitutionunder which political power is divided cart provide answers to all questionsor solutions to all problems. &quot;But in the conditions under which a constitution is to be proposed for Cyprus I am firmly of the opinion that thepreponderating advantage lies in ;constructing as: precise a framework as is reasonably possible.    . rv&apos;..&apos; &apos;      &apos; -::-.c    &quot; .
8. The conditions are so special that I ought briefly to indicate them,ror the last&apos;25 years Cyprus has been governed without political institutionsthat can be described as responsible or... elective,. except so lar as certainorgans of municipal or local self-government have filled the void. The makerof laws and the chief of administration has been the Governor, assisted, ofcourse, by the advice of a Council and of his permanent officials. More thanthat, if one looks further back into the history of the Island, One sees thatno established political tradition has had the opportunity of forming itself in Cyprus. In that setting to undertake the responsibilities of democraticself-government is inevitably to undertake an experiment with but little datato work upon. It seems to me only fair to all those who may&quot; be concerned incarrying out the experiment that they should be presented at the outset withas clear a picture as pencil can draw of the range and limits, of their respectivefunctions, rather than that the frontiers should be left to be defined by trial and error or constitutional convention. For I fear that under the stress ofsuch day-to-day exploration the constitution itself might begin to crack.9. There is a second consideration which&apos;argues the same way. Thenew distribution of political power which is involved in the very granting ofthe Constitution &apos; is a matter of the gravest concern to the differentcommunities which make up the people of Cyprus. Whatever recommenda-tions I make, they are bound to be scrutinised with a suspicious care by thosewho feel with justice that their future is staked upon the. form such recommendations assume. I would like to hope that what I put forwardwill meet those misgivings. But in any event I think that it is to everyone&apos;?advantage that the guarantees proposed should be framed in as rigid and asinflexible a manner as may be and by guarantees I do not mean merely the expression of what I have called in my draft the &quot;fundamental rights.&quot;but I mean also the various special provisions, such, for instance, as the placing of broadcasting under public institutional control or the setting upof a Public Service Commission, which I put forward as being no less essential to the preservation of the rights of separate communities than thedefined rights themselves. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to set up arepresentative Legislature in a British colonial territory under a constitution which unalterably limits its powers, unless the constitution is enacted by law of the United Kingdom Parliament itself. But for all thai I do put forwardwhat I propose, as being in effect a rigid constitution, and the conditionswhich I suggest should govern any move to vary it. on the part of the popularAssembly are such that there seems no practical likelihood of any variationon a matter of substance which affects the interests of the differentcommunities. Even so, a law Which seeks to vary the constitutional powersof the Legislative Assembly is one of the very few cases in which, accordingto my scheme, assent would be reserved by the Governor for Her majesty and would not be a local matter for him as Governor of Cyprus.10. There are two main problems involved in the framing of theConstitutional form. The first is, how to express the relationship betweenthe control of external affairs, defence, and internal security, which I arereserved from, the local Legislature, and the control of the other matters which will fall within the scope of that Legislature. The other is, how toimpose such restrictions on the local Legislature as to secure effective protection-protection &quot; with teeth &quot;-forThe minorities in the Island. when use the word &quot; minorities &quot; I do not at all forget that the minorities are themselves racial communities which possess^ though in, varying. degrees,historical traditions and religious, cultural and, social bonds different&apos;.fromthose of the majority race in Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot. -L7
:\ .&apos;f;.;4;L.f; ^;t(?; tjieifirsts-ft (^ijjtts Jjgojg^the reservation!of;poWMS-that Sypj^^ &apos;will be governed under a system of diarchy.;, There will be two law-makw\,./authorities, their fields distinguished according to their subjects, and two distinct forms of . administrative control. The idea of diarchy is- familiarenough in the history, of the - developing relationship between the UnitedKingdom as^aniimperialf Power and the ^overseas territories which have comewithinhor;passed..without:her central&apos; control. There-is great variety.in the forms in. which it has been expressed-by subjecting Bills in the popularAssembly to the necessityof the Governor^ consent before they can beintroduced, by the use of an official majority, by leaving the Governor free to withhold -assent from numerous categories.of Bills if he; considers thatany;ionerof .them prejudices preserved or protected interests, by giving: theGovernor power to enact legislation on certain subjects/ in the name of the popular Legislature if the) Legislature itself will not take the action required:12: In-the present &quot;case&apos; I have&apos;come to the conclusion that the mostsuitable form is that which recognises most explicitly the existence of thediarchy and its consequences. Accordingly I have proposed to invest theGovernor with full law-making and executive power for his reserved field,and to leave the loealLegislature correspondingly full master in its own field.There will thus be two systems of law-making existing side by side butseparated according to the difference of subject with which they deal. I regard this as the system of diarchy which is simplest to. present as aconception and which is most easily understood by those not concerned withthe niceties of its application; If a public emergency should arise that ofcourse must be dealt with by special provisions but it is better that the Crownshould hot retain any further reserved or supplemental powers of makinglaws for Cyprus by Order in Council, except the unavoidable power to alter the Order in Council itself which sets up the Constitution. It is better, Ithink, that the Governor and the local Legislature should be able to feelthat; between them, they possess the full law-making powers for Cyprus, solong as the Constitution is in being and is honoured by observance.13. I do not mean it as a hollow, phrase when I say that under my proposals the local Legislature and, as a consequence, the ministers responsible to it are intended to be masters in their own, the non-reservedfield. It seems to me that a generous interpretation of my terms of reference in this respect is a fair; exchange for the considerable reduction of the fullpossible scope of responsible self-government which results from the reservation of defence and internal security. Self-government is not. ofcourse, a phrase with a single precise meaning nor does it connote a singleidentifiable form of government. It has in fact been used to cover a widegradation of limited political systems amounting to less than full self-government. But in considering the possible application of such measurestp a,: Constitution for: Cyprus I have deliberately rejected schemes of&quot;phasing,&apos;&apos;the progressive release of selected departments by stages, into thehands of, the self-governing side, each-Stage, measured by proved success jnthe responsible handling of its predecessor. I do not think such, an approach,however appropriate in; other ,circumstances,!, is,&apos; appropriate to this.&apos; CyprusConstitution. The people of Cyprus. I have reminded myself, are an adultpeople enjoying long, cultural traditions and. an established educational system, fully capable of furnishing qualified administrators, lawyers, doctors and. men. of business.. It, is: a... curiosity, of, their.; history that. their, political development has remainedcomparatively immature. It is owed, I think,/to.a people so placed , that, when they are invited to assume politicalresponsibility, the offer should; be generous in the sense that, within the field
&apos;&apos; Jif tr-&apos; &apos;    4M ....&quot;lered, no qualification or restriction should be imposed&apos;that is not honestly&apos;^-jquired by the conditions of the problem.14. Consistently with this I have pared away from my proposals a numberof those features that are often present in colonial constitutions, even thosewhich represent a comparatively advanced stage of development. I- havenot proposed the introduction of any official members into the LegislativeAssembly. I have proposed so restricted a number of nominated members,6 out of a total of 36. that no one can suspect that they represent an obscureattempt to give the Governor a residual influence upon the elected body.On the other hand, nominated members do serve at least the convenientpurpose of allowing the smaller minorities to obtain some representationwithout the formalities of separate communal rolls. In addition I proposethat the categories of legislation as to which the Governor is to be free to reserve assent for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure should be reduced to the bareminimum of four: Bills that seek to alter the Constitution in some respect,Bills affecting currency, coinage or foreign exchange, Bills affecting the royal prerogative,&apos; and Bills affecting the trustee status of Cyprus Governmentstock. Tn all other matters that come within the self-governing field theGovernor&apos;is to have the duty of a constitutional head of government to assentaccording to his Ministers&apos; advice subject to reference to the Supreme court for a judicial ruling upon any Bill that may appear to be itself repugnant tothe various guarantees or restrictions which the Constitution imposes. Lastly,I have omitted altogether any provision for disallowance of Cyprus legislation by Her Majesty V Government except in the single case of legislation preju-dicing the trustee status of Cyprus Government stock. In fact the retentionof this particular power is needed for purely technical reasons in relation tosuch Government stock.15. It is a familiar experience that when different fields of legislative orexecutive power are separated by reference to.subjects as, for instance, infederal constitutions there is on occasions a difficulty in deciding to whichfield a particular piece of legislation or executive act belongs. This difficultywill be liable to occur in Cyprus. Words such as &quot; defence &quot; or &quot; internal security &quot; do not carry a precise connotation. It is necessary therefore to face the question whether the dividing line can be drawn with any adequateprecision by a process of defining a list of particular matters that fall withinthe range of these subjects. It would certainly be. a great advantage if this could be done: for, if it could be done with even reasonable completeness,it would be possible to get rid of one of the most troublesome of those causes of dispute which disturb the relationship between the authorities responsiblefor the two sides of government. At any rate, even if the disputes remained,a means of resolving them by reasonable discussion would be available. Andthat perhaps is as much as anyone can hope to provide.16. I am satisfied, however, that no good will be done by trying toprovide exhaustive definitions. The truth of the matter is that it is the aspector context in which a particular question presents itself, that determines its relation to such subjects as defence or internal security rather than theintrinsic matter with which it deals. This consideration is especially relevantin the case of the Island of Cyprus which contains several;very&apos; large militaryarid air installations, themselves dependent for effective operation upon some measure of co-ordination with the rest of the Island, including its road com-munications, its ports and harbours and its water and power supplies. If onewere to begin to enquire what were the matters with which the authorityresponsible for defence and internal security might conceivably be concerned on some occasion or other, it would be very difficult to confine the list so as&apos;     9 :50776 c*
SInot to include quite a large number of those matters that are the;norr&quot;&quot;Vpreserve of internal self government. Some things are obviously the excluk-/concern of defence and internal security, the control&apos;,and discipline of themilitary forces or of the police force, for instance.: Some things are likely forsome purposes and on some occasions to touch upon defence.and internal security, for instance compulsory acquisition of land and the importation ofgoods or immigration of persons- But it would not be easy to make anylong list of those things of which it can Certainly be said that they will not inany circumstance or for any purpose affect the interests of defence or internal security.17. In that situation the balance of advantage turns against any furtherdefinition than is afforded by the description of the subjects themselves.For either external affairs, defence and internal security are defined by a longlist of matters which covers all the things capable of coming within theirrange, even if ordinarily many of them will not: in which case the range ofself-governing matters is materially reduced in order to take care of the exceptional occasion. Or, to avoid the inconvenience and unfairness of this,the interests of defence and internal security are to some extent jeopardisedby tying them down to a limited range of matters which does not do justice to their possible legitimate range.18. The solution which I propose involves three provisions which shouldbe considered as interdependent upon each other.(a) The Governor must be the final judge both upon the question whetheraction that he feels it necessary to take in the interests of any of hisreserved subjects is properly within their range and upon the obverseof this, whether a Bill of the Legislative Assembly presented for assentdoes or does not trench upon his reserved field. It is not possibleto provide for the reference of such questions to an outside referee,such, for instance, as the Supreme Court. Defence and internal security involve matters which cannot be reasonably exposed ordebated in public proceedings: moreover, they generally requirepositive and effective action, and it is not good sense that the validity of such action should be in suspense during the pendency of judicialproceedings.(b) There should be a consultative body, formed on the highest level, forthe purpose of keeping each side the reserved side and the self-governing side currently informed as to what the other is doing and,perhaps more important, what it proposes to do and why. Such a body should meet under the chairmanship of the Governor himself and from the start it should aim to meet frequently and to discuss fully.The membership that I propose would consist of Governor and deputy Governor, Chief Minister and another Minister nominated by.him, Minister of Turkish Cypriot Affairs, a representative of theDefence forces, Legal Secretary and Attorney-General. In a body ofthis kind-criticisms can be made and policies explained with a freedom-and lack of reserve that could not be expected in an open deliberativeAssembly. I have suggested that this body should be styled the Joint;- . - Council of Cyprus and I suggest that name in order to mark theimportance that I attach to its existence and its functions. Given..: reasonable good will on the two sides I believe that such an institutioncould be effective to iron out the many possible causes of friction towhich a diarchy gives rise and of which the greater part has its originin each side&apos;s ignorance of what the other is up to and the suspicionsand lack of confidence arising from such ignorance.
jll (c) It is-only a development of the idea which lies behind the Joint CouncilIF of Cyprus to propose, as I do, that the Governor should haveconstitutional power to invite the Legislative Assembly to take over from him any particular piece of law-making which, though formallywithin his reserved field, he can conveniently commit to the self-governing side. A power of this kind seems to me a valuable one.It provides the flexibility along that difficult frontier between what isreserved and what not that everyone would wish to see so long as itis felt that no true interest of defence or internal security is prejudiced by looseness of definition. And it affords a means by which to avoid,again given good will, what might otherwise look like an unexpectedinroad by the reserved side into the normal field of self-government.It is my hope that as confidence grows, this power might be increasinglyresorted to.19. I have been critical to examine whether the scheme that I proposefor regulating the relations between the reserved side and the self-governingside does in any true sense deny to the latter a generous opportunity of occupying the field of self-government. I am satisfied that it does not. Itwould be a distortion of the picture to allow the circumstance that at some places and on some occasions the Governor may have to deal with matters that would normally be self-governing matters to suggest that in most placesor on most occasions the self-governing field will be invaded in this way.There is no reason why it should be. It will be the Governors duty topromote the most harmonious relationship that he can achieve between thetwo sources of authority in the Island, sources which unite him in his twocapacities, in one capacity as constitutional head, in the other as autocraticdelegate of the Imperial Government.20. Perhaps the simplest test of the reality of self-government underthe system I have envisaged is to recite the names of the Ministries whichI have provided for on the self-governing side (apart from the Chief MinistersOffice and the Office of Minister for Turkish Cypriot Affairs): Development,Interior and Local Government, Finance, Communications and Works, social services, Natural Resources. It is true that these do not correspond to theexisting Departments of Government, though they provide convenientgroupings of them. But, to translate them into the Departments or Branchesof Government as known to the Cypriot to-day I have invited theAdministration in Cyprus to draw up a provisional list of those departments or branches which under my scheme might be expected to pass into the self-governing field and so under the Ministerial control of persons responsible to the elected Assembly. I set it out accordingly in the Appendix to thisCovering Note.21. I turn now to the problems of the self-governing side itself, havingexplained my proposals as to its relationship with the reserved powers. one thing I can draw attention to at once. My general conception is that theGovernor should withdraw from active intervention in the work of the self-governing side, assuming instead the important, but different, status of. the constitutional &quot; head&quot; on Her Majesty&apos;s behalf. Generally speaking,therefore, he will act on the advice of his Ministers, he will not preside at or take part in meetings of the Cabinet or of the Legislative Assembly.Certain decisions must be taken and acts performed on his own authority,as in the case of any other constitutional head. They will all however befound explicitly identified in my proposed scheme. Thus only he can decide on such matters as proroguing and dissolving the Assembly, relieving a chief minister of his office, the making of certain appointments, the reference of50776c* 2
doubtful Bills to the Supreme Court for advice, the power of pardon. These-s.citations are not exhaustive, but the full list is not a long one.        &quot;       \   ,): 22. &apos; With this said, the chief, problem in finding a suitable framework for the powers&apos;&apos; of self-government is s6 to design.them ihat on the. one ftandself-government becomes a means of reflecting truly the will and purpose ofthe people of Cyprus and on (the, other it doss not become an instrument bywhich a majority drawn frbni:one community overrides the legitimate claimspf,!a minority community to maintain its own life, and customs as an integral part of the life and customs of Cyprus.6 123. Everyone knows that Cyprus is not homogeneous. Taking &apos;thefigures of the 1946 Census (and 11 have no reason to, suppose that since then there has been arty substantial change in favour of minorities),. the. co p u&apos; a: idiiof the Island is formed, as; to about&apos; 80 per cent., of Greek Cypriots, as toabout. 18 per cent,/ of&apos; TurkishyCypriots, and the remaining 2 per cent! consists of smaller &quot;communities; of British residents&apos;,&apos; Armenians, Marohites and others&apos;.Throughout I take no account of the British armed forces who will he- presejllimthe territory from time to time in connection with the base. ,&apos;24;; The influences that make for separation between the communitiesare strorig-religion, language, education, tradition, and custom. They areReflected in ,the towns; by separate quarters for Greek and Turk: in theCbuhtry by Turkish Villages and&apos;Greek villages. On the other hand thereis only a weak,supply of unifying elements which would make for a generalconsciousness that all the communities are Cypriot communities. True allthese statements are generalisations to which there are exceptions. The degree6f separation between Greek and Maronite Cypriot must be small to-day.Not all education is special to its own community: there are one or twovaluable institutions in which boys from all communities receive the sameeducation/side by side. There are mixed villages shared by Greek and Turk.IV^ahyTvirks speak Greek as well,as Turkish, and the English language is a potential: instrument. of common understanding. But communal separation ..remains the general factor.- 25. How far this separation would be reflected in ability of the greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to work together politically, I could not say. j ani conscious that I dp not know enough about the problem. Theirrfepresentatiyes&apos; have worked. together in the past in the service of theGovernment, in municipal administration, in the activities of co-operative societies and of district improvement boards. In some cases the combinationseems to have been happy and unresentful: in others there seem to have beenrecurring suspicions and complaints, on the side of the Turkish Cypriots thatdiscrimination has been practised against them. Whatever the truth of thematter, I have no doubt at all that the circumstances of the last 18 months and the pressure of the Greek Cypriot campaign for Enosis have done muchto. sharpen the sense of alienation between, the two communities, and I thinkthat any plan for the future, must accept the fact of this.alienation, as presentnow and in the future; Zi.  ..yr;,.-.-y.     y, :;:xny       ,yj \;     ,.&apos; o.-s zc-iik in in\:,,, 26.,. The problem,iconics down to the political relations between ;thesetwo communities. The figures that I have, given show that the remainingCommunities are too small in numbers for it to be reasonable that they should expect to have anything more; than the right to have their voices heard in ailelected Assembly and. the. right, to share in the protection of any guaranteesthat limit the powers of the majority in that Assembly. In fact the reprcsenta-tiv.es,of the.Armenian community told me that they did not desire to have,\is&apos;xliipo:i zs y&amp;dj aou:r:)Uyv\ eri) -jhtvo^gcJ pstim isfjsd loifi Hi    ho&apos; -tUnixpb
any special arrangements made for their. representation as a . community.Their best protection lay in good government for all rather than in separateidentification of different interests.  ;.        &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &apos;&quot;&quot; ^     &apos;,2,7- I have given my best, consideration to the claim put before me onBehalf of the Turkish Cypriot cornmuhity1: that they should be accordedpolitical representation equal&apos;to that of the Greek Cypriot community. If Ido not accept it I do not think that it is out of arty lack of respect for themisgivings that lie behind it. But this is a. claim by 18 per cent, of a population to share pblitical power equally with 80 per cent., and. if it is tobe given effect to, I think that it must be made good on one of two possiblegrounds. Either it is consistent with the principles -of&apos; a constitution basedon,liberal&apos;and democratic conceptions that political power should be balancedin this way, of ho other means than the creation of such political equilibrium^ip^pV;&apos;effective&apos;;tp&apos; protect, the essential interests of the community fromOppression by the weight of the majority. I do hot feel that I can stand firmlyon either of these propositions.28.. The first embodies the idea of a federation rather than a UnitaryState. It would be natural enough to accord to members of a federationequality, of ^representation in the federal body, regardless of the numericalproportions of the populations of the territories they represent. But canCyprus be organised as a federation in this way? I do not think so. Thereis&apos; no pattern of territorial separation between the two communities and.apart from other objections, federation of communities which does not involvealso federation of territories seems to me a very difficult constitutional fonh&apos;.if it is said that what is proposed is in reality nothing more than a. system offunctional representation, the function in this case being the community life and organisation and nothing else, I find myself baffled in the attempt tovisualise how an effective executive government&apos; for Cyprus&apos;is to be thrdwnup by a system in which political power is td remain permanently divided inequal shares between two opposed communities. Either&apos;there is stagnationin political life, with the frustration that accompanies it, or some small minority group acquires an artificial weight by being able to hold the balance between the two main parties. A third alternative, that the Governor shouldbe given under the Constitution some sort of arbitral position as between thetwo communities, I have already excluded by what I have said above, I donot think that it will be advantageous to embroil the Governor in the internalcontroversies of the self-governing side. My Conclusion is that it cannot bein the interests of Cyprus as a whole that the constitution should be formedon&apos;the basis of equal political representation for the Greek and turkish cypriot communities. . &apos; , !- &apos; 29. , Does the second ground lead to a different result? I do not - thinkso. To give an equal political strength in a unitary State to two communitieswhich have such a marked inequality in numbers -aii. inequality which; sofar as signs go is as likely to increase as decrease is to deny to the majorityof the population over the whole field of self-government the power to have its&apos;xwill-:f fi action!. , Yet it might well be right to insist onthis denial if the Cohsfifution could hot be equipped with any other effective means of securing the smaller communities in: the possession of their essentialspecial interests: Not only do. I; think that it can be equipped with suchmeans by placing those interests under the protection of&apos; independenttribunals with appropriate;&quot;powers and relying only to a limited&apos;&apos; extent chdirect political devices, but I think that&apos;1 the &quot; legalist&quot; solution which thisdepends on is in fact better suited to.provide the protection that is required,and it does not have the effect of denying the validity of the majority
principle over a field much wider than that with which special communityinterests are truly concerned.30. At this point I will set out the main features of my proposals whichare designed to protect the special interests of the Turkish Cypriot community and its political status.(a) There will be 6 seats in the Legislative Assembly reserved for member selected on a separate roll of Turkish Cypriot voters. This number isto be compared with 24 seats for members elected on a general roll,in effect a roll of Greek Cypriot voters, and is very slightly more thanthe proportion attributable to the respective numbers of the two communities. My proposal to introduce 6 nominated members inaddition has no material bearing on this and their class must in any event take care of nominees to represent other communities, such asnon-Cypriot British residents and Maronites.(b) The consent of two-thirds of the Turkish Cypriot members will benecessary before the Assembly can pass any law which alters theexisting laws of Cyprus regulating Turkish Cypriot domestic affairs,marriage, divorce, Evkaf and Vakfs, &amp;c, or which deals with theireducational, religious, charitable or cultural institutions. On the otherhand the Turkish Cypriot community can invite the Governor to makea regulation amending any of those laws if there is no prospect of theAssembly itself being willing to act.(c) There will be a branch of the permanent administration styled theOffice of Turkish Cypriot Affairs under a Minister appointed by theGovernor from among the Turkish Cypriot members of the LegislativeAssembly. It will be the Government organ for dealing with all thespecial affairs of the community, including its separate schools and educational system, and will have an allotted share of the Cyprusrevenues appropriated for the purpose.(d) The Minister for Turkish Cypriot Affairs will have a seat in theCabinet ex officio and will be a member of the Joint Council of cyprus.(e) All legislative acts of the Assembly and all executive and administrativeactions or decisions on the self-governing side will be subject to thecondition that they must not conflict with certain guaranteed rightsrelating to religion, education, charitable, religious and culturalinstitutions and use of languages. Further there must be no discrimina-tion based on birth, nationality, language, race or religion. Theindependent tribunals to whom complaints about violation of these rights can be preferred will be the Supreme Court, in the case of legislative acts, and the body which I have styled the Tribunal of guarantees, in the case of executive or administrative actions ofGovernment. If a complaint against a legislative act is upheld, theact, or at least the offending part of itrbecomes a nullity. If it is an executive or administrative action that is successfully challenged, the. Tribunal will have a discretion as to how best to deal with it including a power to award compensation to a person injured.31. These are the main, but not the only, provisions which I have proposed for the safeguarding of the position of the Turkish Cypriot community. Thereare others, minor in themselves, which yet make up in combination a system under which the community is secure of its place in the conduct of public affairs. It is my hope that together they will be thought to justify the viewthat, even under a system which concedes an electoral majority to the Greek
o ......^c^iiot^in.ihe\:Legislatiye-:Assembly^ the interests of the smaller community.....can be effectively protected and that the safeguards that are offered are notmere &quot; paper &quot; guarantees.32. 1 have passed over several points in setting out my conclusion, andI return to those of them which need explanation. For instance, I do not propose that the Legislature of Cyprus should comprise a second Chamber.While I have been conscious of what I may call, some general expectation that my proposals would include a recommendation of a second Chamber, Ihave been much less clear what was the purpose that such a Chamber wouldbe. intended to serve. Yet there is no point in designing all the complicationsof a bi-cameral Legislature unless the designer is clear what are the advantages ato be secured by thus duplicating the legislative authority. .33. A second Chamber may serve various purposes. It may act as a substantive check on the activities of the first Chamber in the sense that nothing can become law that does not secure the support of a majority ineach Chamber. But then the second Chamber must have a membershipconstituted on a principle different from that of the first Chamber. otherwise the check is illusory. I have met suggestions that there should be a second chamber for Cyprus formed on a functional principle of representation,comprising representatives of municipalities, religious, educational, and business ^organisations, trade unionsx(,&amp;c;&apos; So there might be, in theory.But the idea offers no solution in Mself. ; First, the significance of such aChamber in acting as an effective cheek upon the other Chamber dependsentirely upon the weighting that is given to the different bodies represented as between the two opposed communities. In deciding on the weighting onetransfers to the formation of the second Chamber just the same controversyon a matter of principle that I have been discussing with regard to the first.And an answer has to be given, one way or the other, to the same question-Is it right to deny validity to the will of the majority for general politicalpurposes? Secondly, I am bound to say that a scheme of functional repre-sentation for a political body, though attractive to me in theory, is not onewhich I would be ready to recommend for introduction into Cyprus unless had had much more opportunity than I have had for working out its actualcomposition with the help of Cypriot representatives on the spot. Certainly,I could not put it forward as a system of representation that is. usual orwidely used to-day.34. But then a second Chamber can serve other purposes than that ofbeing a full partner in the Legislative body. It can be designed to act as alimited check upon the first Chamber, either by exercising a power to delay,though not finally to prevent, the realisation of the will of the first or byacting as a revising agent, subject of course, to the readiness of the first chamber to accept the revisions proposed. No doubt these are usefulfunctions, though they may seem more attractive to the members of a second chamber-that has dwindled the historical status of full partner than tothe members of a new body created from the first to serve no wider, purpose.But 1 do not think that their utility is sufficient to justify the introductionof two separate Chambers into the Legislature proposed for Cyprus. Thepolitical field must, after all, be a comparatively small one; and the advantagelies in looking for. an arrangement which will concentrate all the best availabletalent in one deliberative and law-making body, rather than for an arrangementthat will dissipate that talent among two separate bodies. Incidentally, thework of revision does not essentially require the existence of two separateChambers. It can be carried out, not necessarily with less ultimate effective-ness, by a special committee of a single Chamber, with or without expert
assistance from outside. On the whole, therefore, I came to the conclusit^Jthat no sufficient advantage would be gained by a bi-cameral structure, when there had to be set on the debit side the importance of simplicity, of facinga single Chamber squarely with the responsibility for its own decisions, of avoiding distracting controversies between the two Chambers, and, lastly, of bringing all the available political talent into a single responsible assembly.35. If a second Chamber is favoured as itself the means of protectingminority rights I can only say that I do not think that it would be likelyto prove a good instrument for that purpose. Compared with a system thatallows resort to a competent and independent tribunal, I think it a poorone. In fact it is difficult to see how it can avoid going too far or not far enough. Either it gives the minority a general political power more extensivethan is required for its proper protection, thereby distorting the politicaldistribution, or it makes the minority judge in its own cause as to what itsspecial interests are and what is needed for their protection: or on the otherhand, avoiding this, it gives the minority no more than a nuisance value andso fails to achieve even its legitimate intention.36. With regard to the franchise I recommend the simplest scheme thatis possible. I believe this to be the best way to launch the Cyprus Constitutionamong all the controversies that.will attend its birth.. Accepting as I do thenecessity of a separate communal roll for Turkish Cypriots, I have enquire whether it would be possible to propose some mitigation of the drawbacks ofthus&apos; perpetuating &apos; c6mmurial;&apos;&quot;separation by introducing into Cyprus somescheme for a common roll upon which both Turkish Cypriot and all othervoters would have an additional vote for a limited number of candidates.Such candidates, it might be hoped, conscious of their dependence upon a mixed constituency of voters, would be less likely to pursue strictly communalpolicies than candidates elected on separate rolls. 1 think that perhaps theywould, and the idea that lies behind such schemes may well commend itselfto Cypriot statesmen of the future. If so, measures can be taken to introduceit if it has the necessary support. But there is little experience available asto.how such schemes have worked out in practice, and any version of thisdouble franchise would present the voter in Cyprus with a more complicatedelection issue than I think appropriate for the opening stages of popular self-government. Besides, theory is one thing and electoral management is another: and in the shortage of experience, I do not feel any sufficientconfidence as to the results of such a scheme in practice. A similar conviction of the importance of insisting on all possible simplicity in the franchise arrange-ments has led me to propose that there should be no option for TurkishCypriots to register on the general roll. It seems to me inconsistent with theplan of guaranteeing the community a number of seats proportionate to its total numbers that it should be possible for members of the community toleave1 the -necessary minimum on- the separate roll to cover those seats and transfer the residue of their voting power to the election on the general roll.37. In one matter I have departed on my own responsibility from the franchise rule which previously held good in Cyprus and which was, as Iunderstand, proposed to be retained in more recent discussions on a newConstitution. I propose that women should be admitted as voters equally with men. I cannot think that this is any great innovation, since they alreadyenjoy the vote for certain purposes of local government. Considering thatfemale franchise is1 how so widely accepted and that it is in operation in theUnited Kingdom, in Greece, and in Turkey, I think that if I proposedadherence to the old rule of male franchise I might be thought to be recom-mending a form of -self-government for Cyprus that deliberately departed fromliberal or progressive ideas.  That would be an unfortunate misunderstanding.

It is indeed a t graveresponsibility for a judicial tribunal to decide upon the, validity Of legislativeacts or to confirm Or annul the aB^^j^fiVdJ^f^f Gbverhment. But itis, after all, a judicial&apos;function that has been discharged acceptably by theCourts of many countries under many &quot;systems: &apos; The&quot; first great writtenConstitution of modem&apos; democracy, that of the United States,, owes &apos; itsinterpretation and a large measure of its development to the claim assertedby its Supreme Court to be the final arbiter whether legislative acts of congress were valid or: invalid under the Constitution^&apos;&apos;&apos; And the judicial power hasbeen allotted a similar responsibility under the federal Constitutions ofCanada and Australia. : But there is no riecessary connection between a federal structure and a; judicial power to decide whether legislative acts: arerepugnant to the Constitution.&apos; Indeed the&apos; Governors&apos; power, which Ipropose, to refer a doubtful Bill to the Supreme Court for advice before giving assent is modelled fairly closely on va similar provision in theConstitution of the Republic of Eire. :39. It may be said that Cyprus is a small stage when compared withthese territories, and I have asked myself critically whether, the duty that1 seek to lay upon its Judges is not too heavy for the circumstances of thecase. Can they not only achieve the detachment, required but also obtain from the. public the credit for that detachment?. Both are necessary, if their responsibility is to be discharged. I can only say, after, going intothe matter, that I believe that both objects canbe realised, provided thatone condition is accepted. The Chief Justice, himself must ;be appointedfrom outside Cyprus and the number of Supreme Court Judges from insideCyprus must always be equally balanced between Greek Cypriot and turkish cypriot. Given a President of the Court who by virtue of his origin isuncommitted to either community in the eyes of the public,; I do not feelany misgivings as to the confidence that will be placed in the Judges&apos;impartiality. The Cyprus judiciary enjoys a high reputation for conscientiousperformance of its duties and I think that, so formed, the Supreme: Courtcan safely be entrusted with the responsibility that I propose.40. The Tribunal of Guarantees is, so far as 1 know, a novelty in any constitutional scheme derived from British sources, though it may berecognised as a reflection on a very small. scale of the Conseil d&apos;Etat inFrance. I think that it will be a useful; institution- I was, impressed , bythe point reiterated to me that, if there; is a tendency by members of onecommunity to discriminate at the expense of, the! members of ,another,; itis. at least as likely that the discriminating will be found in the administrative-as^ iff the legislative field.

5fregular Court of Law. But the need for an independent Chairman remafe^.the same..41. I have now completed my brief commentary on the main outline ofmy proposals. But there are two activities for which the Government of cyprus is either responsible or with which it is directly concerned that Ihave not found it possible to fit into my general scheme of self-government without imperilling the basis of equitable protection for each communityupon which it is constructed. One of these activities is broadcasting, the cyprus Broadcasting Service being at present a branch of Government itself:the other is those educational activities, either conducted by government or aided by it, which are not reserved for individual communities.42. To explain the problem raised by these two activities I must clear the ground by stating my general assumptions as to the control of education and information under self-government. The present Department ofEducation provides out of public funds the major part of the cost of allelementary education, which is carried on in separate schools and underseparate systems according to the community concerned. secondary education, with the exceptions that I have referred to above, is also the separate concern of each community, Greek and Turkish Cypriot. virtually no Greek Cypriot secondary school is in receipt of Government grant atpresent; on the other hand grants are received by Turkish Cypriot secondary schools. With the institution of self-government it is to be supposed thatgovernmental relations with Greek Cypriot education will be handled bya.department of education under a Greek Cypriot Minister, while Governmentrelations with Turkish Cypriot education will come under the Office of turkish Cypriot Affairs and its Minister. Information and public relations in general will pass to the self-governing side; but that will not preclude the Governor from setting up independently whatever office for information and public relations relating to his reserved matters he may think necessaryfor their presentation.43. Broadcasting does not fit into such a scheme of division. It is asmuch a normal internal service for the use of Cyprus as, say, electric powerand water and, as such, should fall among self-governing matters. On theother hand, it is most important for the future happiness of the island andits people that broadcasting should be kept secure from the impact of party or political controversies and, above all, from any tendency to favour onecommunity at the expense of another. Yet no one who has had experienceof the problems of controlling the output of a medium such as broadcastingcould suppose that impartiality could be effectively enforced by an outsidetribunal, as the Tribunal of Guarantees, or by any form of external reference.Semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum. The essential things, balance,allocation of times, impartial presentation, depend on a right system at the source. I do not think, therefore, that it affords a proper protection forthe minority communities that broadcasting should be treated merely as oneof the normal incidents of self-government and should pass accordingly underthe control of a Minister responsible to the elected majority in the LegislativeAssembly.    :44- Is there then an acceptable alternative? It would be possible, in theory, to place broadcasting under the control of the Governor himself,not as a reserved or security matter but as a special inter-communal service which he should hold as an impartial trustee for all communities. Yet i cannot bring myself to favour this as a solution. It runs counter to thegeneral line of policy which I recommend, that of withdrawing the Governor
lom active embroilment in the controversies which may divide the two mainCommunities:&quot; Fortunately there is an alternative arrangement which presentsitself as much to be preferred.45. What I recommend is that broadcasting should be turned into achartered public institution, on the lines of the B.B.C., charged with anindependent public responsibility so to conduct the service as to hold afair balance between the interests and claims of the different communities.I do not think that one can define the duty except in some vague general terms such as these. The important thing is that those in control of theservice should be and should be recognised as being independent of externalcontrol or pressure as to all matters relating to the content and handling of the output. For this purpose the composition of the governing boardneeds rigid definition. My proposal is that it should be so formed thatGreek and Turkish Cypriots have equal representation upon it and that,if a difference has to be weighed in the scales, the vote of an independent chairman should decide between them. It does not seem to matter in this case whether he comes from inside or outside the Island, so long as he isnot thought to be committed to either side. But I do not think that amember of the public service in Cyprus would be suitable for the appointment.46. There are two points that I ought to stress before leaving thesubject of broadcasting. One is that my proposal does not merely involvethat the conduct of broadcasting as an independent public institution wouldbe a good way of starting off under a self-governing Constitution. It ismuch more than that. It involves that this method of treating broadcastingas an essential feature of the distribution of powers under the constitution is in its own way as much a guarantee of minority rights as other moreobvious provisions. The other is that I do mean that those who conduct the service should be genuinely free from outside control as to its content:and that this applies to the Governor as much as to any other political authority. This principle does not exclude reasonable provisions in the charter regulating access to the service for the dissemination of officialnotices and information.47. My second problem is concerned with inter-communal education.This rather uncouth phrase denotes those activities in the Cyprus educational system which are not confined to any one community. As they stand theycan be set down on a very short list the English School for boys atNicosia, the American Academy for boys at Larnaca, the American Academyfor girls at Nicosia, the Teachers&apos; Training College for men, the Teachers&apos;Training College for women. In addition plans are now maturing forcertain commercial and technical schools to be conducted by Government:and an impressive Technical Institute is nearing the completion of its layoutat Nicosia. The current cost to Government of its part in the wholeactivity is of the order of  150,000. It is envisaged that it may rise to 500,000 when present plans are completed, but there are capital sums ofsome  1J million that will need to be found apart from what is alreadyearmarked in the Cyprus Development Fund.48. Certain things can be said without argument about these activities.The English School is not a school for the English any more than theAmerican Academy is a school for Americans: they are schools in whichGreek, Turkish, Armenian and other Cypriot boys are educated together.Nor is the English School or the American Academy a place for administeringEnglish or American educational systems to young Cypriots or for trying to impose upon them any new national loyalties.   What they do is to1950776 d* 2
provide a different curriculum from that in force in the separate Greek antTurkish Cypriot secondary schools and an approach to education whicn?sjust because they are inter-communal, is based on a rather wider and more general conception of its purpose. It is one of the admirable characteristics of the people of Cyprus that they have a sincere appreciation of theimportance and value of education. The education offered by the inter-communal schools is, so experience shows, much sought after by parents,as are the opportunities afforded by Government scholarship grants to obtainthe advantages of higher education outside Cyprus. Such a system ofeducation cannot honestly be regarded as a challenge to the separate systemswhich are followed in the Greek and Turkish Cypriot secondary schools or as a threat to bring about &quot; dehellenisation &quot; in the Greek schools a threat to which members of the Greek Cypriot community have been sensitiveduring the period of direct Governors rule. But the inter-communalsystem and all its intangible advantages arising from the mixing of thechildren of the different communities at the formative period of educationdo provide a valuable supplement to the other, separate, systems ofeducation. Taking a reasonably long view, such a means of educationprovides, as I see it, one of the most hopeful paths toward a mitigation ofthe racial separations which are at the bottom of the problem of Cyprus.And it is a path which no one is compelled to take. Those who enter on it enter by their parents&apos; free choice.49. What then is to become of inter-communal education under thenew Constitution? It does not fit into the pattern of the Greek Cypriotdepartment of education or the office of Turkish Cypriot Affairs. It isby its nature a service that bridges the two without belonging to either.If it passes, as a general subject of self-government, into the control of a minister responsible to an elected majority in the Legislative Assembly,I think that it may well be putting too heavy a burden upon him to expecthim to support it and to further its possible developments in the face of hostile opposition from those who can see good only in the traditionalcurriculum of Greek Cypriot separate education. So either we must face the possibility or the probability that this activity, however beneficial to cyprus, will be allowed to fail through lack of the means of support, or an exception must be made to secure its continuance by placing the instruments of. irtter-communal education under a special board responsible to theGovernor, not to the Legislative Assembly. A board formed for this purpose should in my view invite the assistance of Greek and Turkish Cypriotmembers interested in education, but should have an independent Chairman.This is the expedient that I propose. I will mention later what I regard as the financial implications of such an arrangement.50. It only remains for me to give such explanations as seem called for with regard to the financial provisions which are set out in Section Pof the constitutional proposals. I have left it to the last to deal with these points, since I take it to be an uncontroversial principle that the financial arrangements should be adjusted to suit the substantive proposals rather thanthat those proposals should themselves be subordinated to some fixedfinancial conceptions which may be ill-suited to the very special circumstances in which a new Constitution for Cyprus would have to be set on foot.51. The diarchy which is involved in the reserved powers over defence and internal security involves in my view that there will be two separatepublic funds for Cyprus, one controlled by the Governor for the purposeof those fields of administration which are retained in his charge, the other
^Pbeing the produce of the Cyprus revenues which will be available to be raised and appropriated according to the decisions of the self-governing assembly and Ministers.52. The monies needed for the purpose of defence in Cyprus will beprovided, I assume, from United Kingdom funds and will not be regarded asa charge upon the revenues of Cyprus except to the extent of the sum of 10,000 which is its standing annual contribution to Imperial defence. I am not concerned to express a view upon the question whether  10,000 or somelarger sum is the right figure for this purpose, but I think it almost obviousthat the very large sums which are being expended in Cyprus over a periodof years towards its full equipment as a base are not expended for the defenceof Cyprus itself regarded in the limited sense as a territory unconnected withthe British defence system as a whole. It is relevant that these large demands on labour and material and the consumption demands of the troops stationedon base duty do, and will, bring considerable prosperity to the Island out ofthe United Kingdom money spent there, even though most of it is not an expenditure economically productive. This may be a good reason for increasing the fixed charge of  10,000 which for my purposes I have assumedas the contribution figure. But I do not think that anyone would suppose that it alters the general principle that Cyprus revenues cannot properly becharged with the creation and development of the defence base.53. The next item is the cost of internal security, which in substanceis the cost of the Police Force and the prison service. What difficulties thereare in providing for this cost can be discussed in terms of the Police and i will confine my explanation to this. The question that I have had to faceis this: Should the cost of the Police Force be met out of the revenues of cyprus, although the control of that force, including its strength, equipment,rates of pay, &amp;c, is a reserved matter and not therefore within the range ofself-government? I think that a question of this sort is peculiar to thespecial system which is proposed for Cyprus under which the police power is a reserved power. Internal security is, of course, a necessary service tocivilised government. That means that self-government in Cyprus could not exist without some police force and the expenditure needed to maintain it:and I deduce from that that it would be wrong that nothing should berequired from Cyprus revenues to pay for Police, even though the controlof the force is not on the self-governing side. But does it follow from thatthat the whole cost of the force should be found by Cyprus? That conclusion is a very big jump from the first, and I have not been able to persuade myselfthat it would be just to impose this charge when the special circumstances that affect the Cyprus police force are understood. In my view the only fair thing is some sharing arrangement.54. What is happening is that the Cyprus Police force is undergoing a thorough reorganisation. The outbreak of the emergency in April 1955 isthought to have shown up serious deficiencies in numbers, training and organisation. The scheme of reorganisation is only now getting under way and it will be years before it will be completed according to the new scalethat is designed for it. One or two figures will show the measure of thechange. In 1954 the Police expenditure was about  600,000. The establish-ment authorised at the close of that year was Officers 51, Other Ranks 1,363.The total strength as recommended by the recent Report of the Cyprus PoliceCommission, 1956, and accepted by the Government is approximately 3,000all ranks, rather more than double. Disregarding special expenditure whichwill&quot; not recur when the emergency is over, the future level of recurrent expenditure planned for Police is some  2,625,000 to  3,125,000 and that
0    . 0&quot;    &quot;ESSon Prisons is in the region of;  125,000.   To this must be added a very-considerable capital expenditure on rehousing the police and on new buildings, which plan, if fully implemented, will require another  5 million over the next five years.55. None of this expenditure will be controllable by the LegislativeAssembly. No doubt Police matters will be canvassed in the Joint Councilof Cyprus, but the responsibility . for the strength and organisation of theForce will remain with the Governor. I do not think that the situation would be improved if an official representative were to attend the LegislativeAssembly and answer questions relating to the Police. It could be done,but where there is neither control of finance nor control of policy I doubtif question and answer are a useful expedient.56. The total Cyprus revenue for 1956 was about  12 million^itselfrepresenting a remarkable advance over recent years due largely to the pressure of defence expenditure. Even if  12 million is taken, as arepresentative annual figure, it looks as if about 25 per cent, of it would be needed to be appropriated for Police costs, if the whole burden were to be thrown on Cyprus.57. My conclusion is that it would be unjust to Cyprus to make such a requirement, whatever the future level of Cyprus revenues. I ought to say,though, that I have not detected any reason for supposing that they will show much increase in the next few years, while one item of importance maywell decline. I think that it would be a bad thing to try to start constitutionalself-government on a financial basis that is itself unfair. Internal security and defence are separate subjects, but they are not entirely distinct. Itseems to me only reasonable to say that the necessity to create and tomaintain a thoroughly effective police force in Cyprus is in part a recognition that we must be secure in the use of our base. What I recommend thereforeis that a sum should be fixed as an annual contribution from the Cyprusrevenues towards the total cost of Police and Prisons, to be paid into theDefence Fund, and that the balance should be provided by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment out of United Kingdom funds. 1 thought it reasonable, if a formula had to be found, to turn to 1954, the year before the emergencybroke out, to find a &quot; normal&quot; basis for police expenditure in Cyprus andthen to write the figure up to the higher scales prevailing in 1956. That has produced the figure of  750,000 for Police and Prisons that I use in my proposals. I ought to add that, though I am firmly committed to the principleof sharing, I am not committed to the actual figure. Considering howdeficient even the 1954 establishment (it was not filled) may be thought tohave been shown to be in the light of what has happened since, my figuremay be rather too favourable to Cyprus.58. With regard to broadcasting I do not find that the same difficulties arise. It is a service for the people of Cyprus in the full sense: and the mere fact that the need to safeguard the different interests of the variouscommunities has led me to propose that its control should not be placed under the elected Assembly does not provide any good reason why thefinance for it, so far as it is not self-financing out of licences and advertise-ments. should not continue to be met out of Cyprus revenues. I have no right to suppose that it will at any time be self-financing. It runs at a deficit of some  100,000 at present- When a planned extension of facilities hasbeen completed, as it shortly will be, it is hoped to reduce the annual deficitto a figure in the region of  50,000. What I propose is that the annualestimates should be approved by the Governor in consultation with the22&quot;The figure of  12 millions was taken from the official Estimates for 1956, presented by the Governor to the Elxecutive Council on27th March, 1956.    After the submission of thisJ    Report it was brought to ray notice that Cyprusrevenue for 1956 is now qfMmated as likelyto amount to about  13.5 millions;   on theother hand the expenditure for the same period is expected to increase still more, above theprevious estimates.     These facts should be recorded;   but the point that paragraph 56 is dealingwith remains the same. &quot;
ylinister of Finance and the Minister for Turkish Cypriot Affairs. He should then be empowered to send a precept to the Finance: Minister for the amount required to meet the estimated deficit and the sum so certified will thus become a charge on Cyprus revenues. I recommend also that the broadcasting Corporation^ annual accounts should be laid before theLegislative Assembly with a report on them by the Auditor-General.59. There remains the financing of inter-communal education. Valuableas such education is, it is not nor is it likely to be a major item of anyone&apos;budget. As I have said, even allowing for planned developments, its annual cost to Government is not expected to be more than  500,000. And the enquiries that I have made do not suggest that, with the shortage of suitableteachers and facilities, any large-scale development could be undertaken in any near future. But what fund ought to bear the charge of it? It isin the same situation as broadcasting in the sense that it is purely a Cyprusservice for the benefit of Cypriots: on the other hand, unlike broadcasting, and pro- tanto, the police, it is not a necessary service, since it merely supplementsother systems of education for the benefit of those parents who wish their children to be educated in this way. For reasons that I have explained I amproposing that inter-communal education should be placed under the Governor,with the help of an education board on which Greek and Turkish Cypriots willbe equally represented. Neither its maintenance nor its possible development will therefore be under the control of the Legislative Assembly or the cabinet of Ministers. The position is anomalous, and I think that the best thing is to look for a practical solution rather than to try to apply some general principle which has no real application to the case. My recommendation is that thenecessary funds should be found by Her Majesty&apos;s Government out of UnitedKingdom resources as a supplement to the monies already provided orpromised for the economic development of Cyprus. It will be a worthwhilegift from the people of this country to the people of Cyprus, and at a time when such large expenditure has to be incurred in the island for the more general purposes of defence it is not a bad thing that this and other developmentmonies should be visibly expended at the cost of the British taxpayer for the direct benefit of the internal purposes of Cyprus.60. My proposals therefore call for financial contributions from theUnited Kingdom to two special purposes to pay for part of internal security and to pay for inter-communal education. I think that the reasons why thesecontributions are called for are valid independently of the rise or fall of cyprus revenues in general or the taxing policy pursued by the CypriotGovernment, because these reasons arise out of the constitutional structureitself. On the other hand, it is my view that, if these contributions aremeasured and provided as I have proposed, they close any question of further contributions from United Kingdom sources in general aid of the Cyprusbudget. Cyprus is not, so far as any investigations of mine have led me, one ofthose territories which should require or expect a grant in aid in supplementOf general administration. Nor do I think that such a system, with theattendant complications of more or less detailed Treasury inspection and approval of each year&apos;s budgetary position, is consonant with the conception of free and independent control of self-governing matters which I have madethe basis of my constitutional proposals.61. I could not finish this covering memorandum without acknowledginggratefully the help that I have received during the course of my work. before i do so I may take the opportunity of stating without qualification upon whatauthority my proposals rest, since I would prefer them to he criticised forthe merits or demerits of what they in fact contain rather than for not being
43 Iwhat they have at no time purported to be. The sole responsibility for &apos;&amp;;:.: iproposals is mine. They are not the outcome of negotiations, sinclrnegotiations have not taken place: nor do they represent suggestions whichhave been made to and worked out with any or all of the parties principally concerned. The reasons that prevented the holding of any round-table conference are familiar and do not need enlargement from me. On the otherhand it would be misleading to allow the impression to prevail that my proposals have been produced in ignorance of the main attitudes and positions of these parties. Those are not difficult to ascertain for anyone who has theopportunity, as I have had, to study something of the history of Cyprus since1878, of its constitutional controversies, and of the successive sets of proposals and discussions that are recorded from time to time up to the present day.Moreover, during the two visits to Cyprus that I have paid in the last four months I have not lacked means of learning at first hand of the attitude ofthe Turkish Cypriots, which has been presented to me officially, or somethingat first or second hand of the points of view of the Greek Cypriot and of theother communities in Cyprus.62. I have received sincere and generous assistance from the Governor of cyprus, His Excellency Sir John Harding, his staff and all members of theadministration in Cyprus, British, Greek and Turkish, with whom I was brought into contact. They spared no effort to make my visits informativeor to make it possible for me to see and hear what I could during the time that I was there. The members of the Colonial Office in London whom I have called upon for advice have always been ready to let me draw upon their fund of knowledge and experience. Lastly, I can put on record my gratefulappreciation of the services rendered by the two secretaries of my Commission,Mr. Geoffrey Cassels in Cyprus and Mr. Derek Pearson of the Colonial Office,without whose able co-operation my work would have been much longer andeven more difficult.(Signed) RADCLIFFE.London,12th November, 1956.
