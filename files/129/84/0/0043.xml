-    186rHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1957CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (57) 34th January, 195755CABINETSUEZ CANALNote by the Prime MinisterMy colleagues may be interested to see the attached letter which I havereceived from Dr. Gerbrandy. They will no doubt remember him as the PrimeMinister of the Netherlands and our loyal ally during the war.A. E.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,1st January, 1957.Prof. Mr. P. S. GerbrandyKanaalweg 113cScheveningen December 30, 1956.The Right Honourable Sir Anthony Eden,10 Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.Dear Sir Anthony,It was for me a great disappointment that your Suez-canal policy did not meet with the success it deserved. I was greatly disturbed too when I read aboutyour bad health. The more I am grateful now that you returned into office as a completely recovered man.
I write to you in order to express my full satisfaction with the step you and your Cabinet have taken in the matter of the Canal. You have had to acceptmany disloyal reproaches (and worse than that) on the part of many of your owncountrymen. Let me assure you that in the Netherlands the majority of the Dutchj3   people were in complete agreement with your action. Not you and Mollet areto blame for the policy against Nasser. The Labour Party and theuncomprehensible policy of the United States torpedoed a sound action, that wasin the common interest of all the Western nations. In the House of Commons(Second Chamber) I asked our Minister for Foreign Affairs (who certainly wasnot against you): why did you not immediately support whole-heartedly theEden-Mollet-policy in the United Nations against what in my opinion looks like a stab in the back by the State Department.The outcome may not have been what you rightly expected, at least fiveimportant things have been achieved:1. the delivery of arms to Egypt from U.S.S.R. and satellites have been stopped for the time being,2. the internal military impotence of dictator Nasser has been shown,3. the people of Israel will get some time of rest,4. Egypt had to accept a kind of international intervention,5. the Suez-canal-zone is no longer under sole Egyptian control.I thought it opportune to assure you that many friends here are convincedthat history will justify your action.All best wishes for you personally and for your great country in the yearto come.Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.) P. S. GERBRANDY.
