confidential.F0(56) 28620th December,, 1956MEETINGS DURING THE PARLIAMENTARY RECESSNote by the Prime minister hope that my colleagues will be able to take some well-earnedrest during the Christmas recess.    A good deal of important workremains to be done by the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees this week,but I would like my colleagues to be able to count on a period of respitefrom the end of this week until at least Wednesday, 2nd January.    Thiswould mean in practice that from Friday, 21st December until Thursday,3rd January there would be no meetings of Cabinet Committees - and nomeetings of the Cabinet itself unless these were absolutely necessaryfor the transaction of emergency business.     If an emergency cabinet has to be held during this period, I should not wish all members of theCabinet to feel that.they must necessarily attend    arrangements wouldbe made to summon such Ministers as were in London or within easyreach of it.COPY NO,77CABINETA.E.10, Downing Street, S.
