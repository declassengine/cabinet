I 9i. wSECRETC.P.(56) 279 COPY NO.10th December, 1956.CABINETFEDERATION OF MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission,under the Chairmanship of LordReidhas discussed the future positionand functions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council inrelation to appeals from the Federation of Malaya after the grant of independence,2.        The basis of the appellate jurisdiction of the Privy council from those Commonwealth countries which have retained the right ofappeal, and from the Colonies, is the subjects right of appeal tothe steps of the Throne.    The jurisdiction and practice of the privy council depends upon the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, which providesthat appeals brought before Her Majesty are to be referred to theJudicial Committee.      The Judicial Committee is required to reportto The Oueen and the appeal is determined by The queen in council by an Order in Council.     Constitutionally, therefore, the right ofappeal, and its determination, depends upon the nexus between thesubject and The Queen.3.        In Malaya, however, the constitutional position is somewhat different.     Clause 83 of the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948,contained a request by the Malayan Rulers to Her Majesty to receiveappeals to Her Majesty in Council from the Supreme Court of Malaya,and expressly conferred upon Her Majesty the necessary power and jurisdiction.     The Agreement recorded the acceptance by her Majesty of this power and jurisdiction, and was given the forceof law by s.5 of the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.Further provision was made by local Malayan legislation (OrdinanceNo. 50/1949).     ThiS&apos; special arrangement preserved the essence ofthe constitutional position, viz. the appeal from the Malayan SupremeCourt lies direct to The Queen and the function of the JudicialCommittee as Her statutory body of advisers is unimpaired.4.        Malayan Ministers wish to retain the right of appeal to theJudicial Committee but not within the present constitutional frame-work.    They say that after Malaya has become an independentmember of the Commonwealth Her Majesty will cease to be theFountain of Justice in the Federation and will have no jurisdictionthere.     It would therefore no longer be appropriate for advice onMalayan affairs to be tendered by the Judicial Committee to her majesty, for no Order in Council made by Her Majesty could haveeffect in Malaya.     Malayan M ministers have suggested that, in viewof this alteration in the constitutional position, the Judicial Committee-1-
layshould be empowered to advise the new Head of State in Malayain the same way as they now advise The Queen, and that their advice should be incorporated in an Order made by him and deciding the appeal.5.        The Malayan proposal is entirely novel and raisesimportant constitutional implications.     Even assuming that it wasdecided to accede to it, an arrangement which involved the JudicialCommittee advising not The Queen in Council but the Head of another state within the Commonwealth could not be brought within theexisting provisions of the Judicial Committee Act, 1833.     special legislation would be needed but the grant of independence to Malayawill, in any case, involve legislation.6;        The Lord Chancellor, whom I have consulted, agrees with me that it is of the greatest importance to the future developmentof the Commonwealth that the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committeeshould be preserved, and that there should continue to be a rightof appeal not only from the new Malayan Federation but also fromother Colonial Territories now approaching independence.     what we decide to do for Malaya will inevitably have its influence uponthe relationship of the Judicial Committee with these colonial territories and also with the older Commonwealth countries.The whole future of the Judicial Committee is, in our opinion, at stake and, if we can find a formula which will at once satisfy theaspirations of the Malayans and the susceptibilities of the olderCommonwealth countries, we may be able to arrest the tendency in the Commonwealth to abolish the right of appeal for nationalistreasons.     There is reason to believe that, in India and Pakistan,at any rate in le^al circles, the decision to ahnli-sh the right of&quot;appeal is alraady being regretted.7.      I suggest that these questions be referred as a matterof urgency for detailed consideration by a Committee of Ministersconsisting of the Lord President, the Lord Chancellor, theCommonwealth Secretary, the Paymaster-General, the Attorney-General and myself.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.I.10th December, 1956.
