secret.P.(56) 27511th December, 1956.CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIntroductionOn 23rd October the Cabinet decided that a reference in general terms on House of Lords reform should be included in The queen&apos;sSpeech.   (C,M.(56) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 2).    The passage in the speech read as follows:-&quot;It is My Governments intention to put forwardduring the present session proposals forreforming the composition of the House of Lords&quot;.2.      At the same time the Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal andthe Chief Whip to make confidential soundings amongst the government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons.     I understand that these soundingshave taken place and I hope that the Cabinet may now be in a positionto come to a decision in principle between the alternative schemes which I have put before them.    These are  -(a)    A comprehensive scheme of reform based on thecreation of 200 life Peers and on representationof the hereditary peerage by 200 Peers selected by a Committee of the House of Lords.(b).   A scheme limited to reversing the decision in theWensleydale case by taking power to create life peers but without any limitation on their numbersor any reduction in the numbers of hereditary Peers.3.      I have already stated my reasons for preferring the first ofthese alternatives.    The need for a decision now by the Cabinet onwhich of them is to be adopted is in order that I may take furthersoundings among the Unionist Peers and with representatives of theChurch of Scotland.4.      If, as I have recommended, there is to be a comprehensive scheme of reform on the lines of the Longer Version of the draft bill which I submitted to Cabinet in July (C.P,(56) 189) there are certain amendments to that scheme which I wish to propose to my colleagues.COPY NO.  -* O
Church of Scotland5o      I have become increasingly impressed with the difficulty of resisting the claim of the Church of Scotland for representation in the reformed House.    The Church can say that its position is comparable tothat of the Church of England in that it is a national established Churchand that its Ministers are disqualified from sitting in the House ofCommons.     We can be certain that the claims of the Church will be strongly pressed on these lines.     I set cut at Annex A the terms ofa Deliverance adopted by the General Assembly of the Church of scotland in May, 1948, and the comments which were made on it by the RoyalCommission on Scottish Affairs.6.      I have personally come to the conclusion that the Church ofScotland should be represented in the reformed House and that discussions should take place at once with representatives of the Church on themethod by which this is to be done.7.      There are several methods by v/hich the Church of Scotlandmight be represented.     The main difficulty is that it is repugnant both to Fresbyterian ideas and to the system of government of the Churchfor appointments of any kind in it to be made by the Crown.     One wayof getting round this difficulty might be to provide that the general assembly of the Church should have power to nominate a certain numberof representatives in the House of Lords.    But this would be a sort ofsectional representation which would, I think, set a very dangerous precedent.    Another possibility might be to provide that the Moderatorof the General Assembly for the time being and the five most recentholders of the office should be included amongst the life Peers.    Theeffect of this proposal, however, would be that the representativesof the Church would, in general, sit in the House for only six years,which would be completely anomalous with the position both of the life peers and of the Bishops who will continue to retain their seats until they die or retire.    Moreover, Moderators and ex-Moderators may notbe the most suitable persons to be members of the House of Eordsand some of them would find it difficult to attend the House becauseof their parochial duties.    On the whole, I think that the most hopefulline of approach would be to provide in the Bill that there shall beincluded amongst the number of life Peers (but supernumary to thelimit of 200) six life Peers to be appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the General Assembly.This may still be offensive to Presbyterian susceptibilities but, if theChurch could be induced to accept it, it would be the simplest course open and would avoid the difficulties inherent in the other proposalsdiscussed above.8.      The suggestion that the number of representatives of theChurch of Scotland should be sixf assumes that the representation ofthe Church of England will remain as it is to-day.    The Archbishop of canterbury should presumably be told informally about the Scottishproposal;   though we need not ask for his agreement.    At the sametime his views should be sought about the possibility of reducing thenumber of Bishops in the reformed House.99      I ask the Cabinet   -(1) To decide in principle that representation shouldbe accorded to the Church of Scotland.
(2)  To authorise the holding of discussions withrepresentatives of the Church with a viewto obtaining their agreement to the proposaloutlined above.(3)  To authorise the holding of discussions with the archbishop of Canterbury about the possibilityof reducing the number of Bishops in the reformed House.Committee of Selection10.     My colleagues will remember the discussion of the Committee of selection in Cabinet when the view was expressed that the reform bill would be more acceptable to the Commons if it provided expressly for representation of the principal political Parties on the Committee of selection in proportion to the votes cast at the previous General Election(CM. (56) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 2).    I am, however, afraid that this may not be very palatable to the hereditary Peers, for they axe likelyto fear that, if we concede such representation of political Parties on theCommittee, we may be forced to yield to demands that the same principleshall be applied in the selection of the hereditary Peers.    They arelikely to feel that this would be deplorable and that both the hereditary peers and the life Peers should be chosen primarily for their individualsuitability as members of the House of Lords.    No doubt the Bill should contain a provision drawing the attention to the need for the representationof the political Parties on the Selection Committee, but it should alsoemphasise that it should be comprised of the best men available.     I havehad a draft provision submitted to me by the Official Committee.     It isas follows:-&quot;The functions of the House of Lords under this section shall stand referred to a Committee of that House to beappointed for each Parliament, which shall include among its members the Lord Chairman of Committees and theLeaders in that House of each of the principal politicalFarties, and shall otherwise be composed with regardnot only to the personal qualifications of the Peersavailable for appointment but also to the need to securedue representation of each of the said political Partiesas well as of Peers not being members or declaredsupporters of any such Party. &quot;11.     The composition of the Committee of Selection is obviously amatter of great importance, and I should be grateful for the views of mycolleagues before I go back to the Unionist Peers.Cabinet Ministers and ex-Cabinet Ministers(a)   Ex-Ministers12.    The present scheme provides that both Cabinet Ministers and ex-Cabinet Ministers shall be exempted from the process of selection.In present circumstances the numbers of hereditary Peers would workout roughly as follows.    In addition to the 200 selected hereditary Peers,the Royal Dukes and the two or three hereditary Peers who hold or have held high judicial office (and who are needed for the judicial business of
the House), there would be about 40 holders or ex-holders of cabinet office, of whom 7 only would be members of the Labour Party.    Some ofthe ex-Ministers are very old and never attend the House,    Thispreponderance of the hereditary Peers over the life Peers, and of theConservative Party over the Labour Party, must prove a stumbling block.Moreover, it is undesirable that the reformed House should contain anumber of hereditary Peers who are past their best.     I recommend,therefore, that ex-Cabinet Ministers should not be exempt from theprocess of selection.     It is practically certain that any ex-minister who was still active would be selected.(b)   Ministers and other holders of Government office13.    Another weakness in the scheme has become apparent.    It will,I think, be essential to the passage of the Bill that it should not be madedifficult for a Labour Prime Minister to ensure adequate representationof his Government in the House of Lords.     Under the present scheme a situation might well arise in which such a Prime Minister would find,when he wished to make Government appointments in the House of Lords,that the annual quota of life Peers had been used up or, when the finallimit of 200 had been achieved, that there was no vacancy.14.    It can no doubt be argued that, if the initial selection of 75 life peers is well balanced, the power to increase the numbers annually by15 and the power to fill vacancies arising through death or resignationwill give the Prime Minister of the day a sufficient margin;   and, nodoubt, the Government, whatever its complexion, will have some supportersamongst the selected hereditary Peers from whom Ministers might be chosen.    But successive Governments in recent times have found itnecessary, on coming into office, to create a large number of peeragesfor the purpose of filling Government appointments, and it seems unlikelythat this need will wholly disappear in the reformed House.15.     I think, therefore, that there should be a power in the Bill to exceed the prescribed limits on the numbers of life Peers for the purposeonly of enabling the Prime Minister to make Government appointmentsin the House of Lords.    The power would extend to cover the appointmentof the most junior members of a Government, such as Lords in Waiting,16.    If there is to be power to exceed the limits of the numbers of life Peers for Ministerial purposes, it would be logical and convenient to deal in a similar fashion with Ministerial representation among the hereditary Peers.    An incoming Prime Minister might wish to makeMinisterial appointments in the Lords either from the ranks of hereditary Peers who have not been selected or by conferment of newhereditary peerages.     If the Prime Minister could do this, then he wouldhave complete freedom of choice between the conferment of life Peeragesor hereditary peerages in forming his Ministry.17.    As a matter of presentation, I believe that this course would bemore acceptable generally than exempting Ministers and ex-ministers from the process of selection, as we originally proposed.    A draft clausefor this purpose is set out in Annex B to this paper.
-?. Q tomm18.     I invite my colleagues to agree that -(a) ex-Ministers holding hereditary peeragesshould not be exempt from the processof selection;(b) the Prime Minister should be empoweredto fill Ministerial appointments in theJLords without being bound either by the limitations imposed by the Bill on thecreation of life Peers, or by the provisions for the selection of hereditary Peers.Swamping19.    I have given further thought to swamping in the light of thediscussion on 23rd October.    I remain of the opinion that, if the LongerVersion of the Bill is adopted, the swamping power is unnecessary andshould not be retained.20.    In favour of its retention it has been argued that to do away withswamping would technically at any rate amount to a small increase in thepowers of the House of Lords.    But, as the suspensory veto has in anycase been reduced to one year, and nine months of that is likely to be occupied by the consideration of a contested measure in both Houses, thedelay caused by the veto is in fact only three months.    That I suggestis the minimum breathing space that ought to be accorded to enable the electorate to give proper consideration to the issue in question.21.    I invite my colleagues to agree that there should be no provision in the Bill preserving the swamping power.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.Uth December, 1956.
ANNEX AThe General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May, 1948,adopted a Deliverance in the following terms:-&quot;While appreciating the services rendered by the bishops of the Church of England who have seats in theHouse of Lords, they are of opinion that for the adequateexpression of the voice of the Christian Church in GreatBritain a wider representation is necessary, and theyspecially advance the claim of the National Church ofScotland to an appropriate share in such representation. &quot;The Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs commented on thisDeliverance in their report as follows:-&quot;This question is outside our terms of reference, but since it has now been raised we feel it to be our duty torefer to a recommendation contained in the evidencetendered to us by the Church of Scotland representatives.They drew our attention to a Deliverance of the general assembly of the Church.....We commend this claim tothe notice of those who participate in the deliberationsconcerning the Reform of the House of Lords. &quot;
