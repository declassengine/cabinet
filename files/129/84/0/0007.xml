SECRETCP.(56) 2576th November, 1956CABINETSUPPLY OF WARSHIPS TO T JRKEYMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe problem the Cabinet, on 21st August, considered a memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (56) 202) about the Turkish Government1wish to buy 1 &quot;Dido&quot; Class cruiser, 4&quot;M&quot; Class destroyers, 4 &quot;Battle&quot;Class destroyers, and 8 &quot;Bay&quot; Class frigates.    The Cabinet invited the First Lord, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Defence, to examine the possibility of making availableto the Turkish Government 3 frigates under the arrangements beingformulated within the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organisation for theloan of warships.    (CM.(56) 60th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        Admiral Arnom, Head of the Turkish Purchasing Missionalready in this country, has, however, told the First Lord that theTurkish Government maintain their request for 1 cruiser, 4 destroyers and 8 frigates.    The First Lord believes that the Turks would treatas derisory an offer merely of the loan of 3 frigates.3. The vessels which the Turks desire are available but thecost of refitting and storing them and providing base spares (alsodesired by the Turks) would be between  9 and  10 millions.4. Since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, the Turks, both in London andin Ankara have shown that they are most anxious to acquire theseBritish warships.     They have made it clear that they hope to begranted extended credit terms;   and that they expect Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to treat the matter as a political rather than acommercial issue.Arguments against meeting the Turkish request5. (i)  M^ney lent to the Turks to buy warships couldonly be repaid at the expense of british commercial creditors, to whom Turkeyalready owes some  18 millions.(ii)  Thus we could only provide warships either as an outright gift or by a loan, the repayment of which we would have to be willing to deferindefinitely when it fell due.copy NO.
(iii) Other countries, e. g. Brazil, Peru, Spain,and possibly certain commonwealth countries also, similarly interested inacquiring surplus ships, would expectequally generous treatment.Arguments for meeting the Turkish request6. (i)  The importance of Anglo-Turkish solidarityin the Middle East grows daily:   Turkeyhas supported us staunchly over Suez.(ii)   The Turkish navy urgently requiresreplacements.    These would make Turkeya more effective member of N.A.T.O.and of the Bagdad Pact.(iii)   The forging of a long-term link betweenthe British and Turkish navies is particularly desirable at a time when the Anglo-Greeknaval connection is virtually at an end.(iv) Turkish goodwill is an indispensable pre-requisite of any permanent settlement ofthe Cyprus oroblem.     The Turkish FrimeMinister, M. Menderes, who has shown aparticular interest in the purchase of warships,has a dictatorial and arbitrary nature;   the repercussions of offending him might be far-reaching, especially if we were at the sametime to take a tough line with him over self-government for Cyprus.Considerations7. The remarks of the purchasing Mission (see paragraph above) no doubt represent a bargaining position. It would be un-realistic to consider the Turkish request on an all-or-nothing basPossible compromises are:(i)  An offer of 4 destroyers, the total cost of which(with refit and stores) would be about  3 millions.H. M. Ambassador at Ankara has expressed theopinion that he could make a great deal of suchan offer.(ii)  An offer of hulls alone, i. e.  a cruiser costing 360,000, 4 destroyers costing  455,000 and frigates costing  1 million - approximately 1.8 millions in all.     The Turks would then have to arrange for these hulls to be fittedout elsewhere, e. g. in Italian yards.     Such an offer might well be rejected, but might be preferable to an outright refusal.
8. In Turkey&apos;s present economic position, the supply of warships to Turkey would amount to a political subsidy and would implyacquiescence on our part in the indefinite postponement of repayments.But I consider that the case for such a subvention exists.9.        I invite my colleagues to consider this matter and to decide to what amount we could contemplate meeting the Turkish request by way of a special credit or gift for warships.     Officials could thenmeet to prepare a detailed reply to the Turkish Government.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.5th November, 1956.
