3 E C RETLord Eadcliffe&apos;s report on a constitution for Cyprus isbeing published today as a White Paper in the United Kingdomand,in Cyprus,    It is in two parts - the recommendations forthe constitution and a covering note which explains why hehas preferred his conclusions to other possible arrangements.It is a statesmanlike document and the whole House will,I am sure, be grateful for the vigour with which he hascarried out his task and the wisdom which he has shown.,/Her Majesty !s Government have brought these proposals tothe attention of the Greek and Turkish. Governments.    (Thisparagraph will probably need expanding)^/Her Majesty&apos;s Government,after consultation with the governor of Cyprus, accept   as a whole the proposals which Lord Radcliffehas made.    In our view they represent a fair &quot;balance betweenthe different and often conflicting interests which are involved.Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to introduce such a constitution as soon as we are satisfied that a situationexists in Cyprus in which genuine elections can be held free from violence and intimidation.    A start is at once being madewith the drafting of the necessary constitutional instrumentsso that elections may be held,   as soon as conditions allow.As the H0use knows , the Terms of Reference given to LordRadcliffe envisaged a constitution for a self-governing Cyprusunder British sovereignty.    As  regards the eventual status ofthe Island,, Her Majestj^s Government have already affirmedtheir recognition of the principle of self-determination.When the international and strategic situation permits, and provided that self-government is working satisfactorily.Her Majesty&apos;s Government will he ready to review the questionof the application of self-determination.When the time comes for this review, that is, when theseconditions have been fulfilled,  it will be the purpose ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure that any exercise ofself-determination should be effected in such a manner thatthe Turkish Cypriot coimiunity no less than the Greek cypriot community shall have freedom to decide for themselves their future status.      In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill not exclude a partition of the Island as an eventualsolution, if no other alternative proves to be practicable.Her Majesty&apos;s Government will keep in close touch withthe Greek and Turkish Governments on the international aspectsof the problem.I hope that we are on the eve of a new and happy chapterin the long history of Cyprus.    It is the intention ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to do all that it can to bring this about.
