(57) 44 th January, 1957CABINETTHE STATE OF THE ECONOMYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Suez operation has been a tactical defeat. It is our task to ensure that,like the retreats from Mons and Dunkirk, it should prove the prelude to a strategicvictory. It can be done. But it can only be done if we nerve ourselves to bolddecisions. Our policy, at home and abroad, must be based upon our real resources.Our task at home is to increase, these resources, by stimulating investment and production, and by increasing exports. Abroad, we must use what we can affordat the points where there is most to be gained. The immediate purpose of this paper is to set out my views on the economic and financial aspects of our problem.Budget Forecast2. The urgent question which faces us concerns the Budget for 1957. Forthe Estimates must be settled within a few weeks or even days. In order to setout the picture, here are the probable figures (all in   millions) for the current year (1956-57):-&quot;Above-the-line&quot; Revenue and expenditure total RevenueExpenditureConsolidated FundDefenceCivil     ......&quot; Above-the-line &quot; surplus ...Budgetestimate5,1987781,4992,461Estimatedout-turn5,1828331,540 (including Suez)2,4804,7384604,853329&quot; Below-the-line &quot; deficitBudget estimateEstimated out-turnOverall BalanceBudget estimateEstimated out-turn803681-343-352And now the figures (also in   millions) forecast for next year, 1957-58:&quot;Above-the-line&quot; Revenue and expenditure total Revenue       ......      5,25551001 b
7931,5502,726Above-the-line &quot; surplus ...5,069186&quot; Below-the-line &quot; deficit (estimated)750Overall balance (estimated)-5644. There are certain additional points on these figures to which I would call attention:  (a) On the civil side, expenditure, as between the 1956-57 Estimates (as laterrevised by the  100 millions operation) and the present prospects for1957-58, is due to increase by  280 millions. The major items in this increase are the National Health Service ( 49 millions), Education( 65 millions), Exchequer Grants to Local Revenues ( 14 millions),Food and Agriculture Subsidies ( 25 millions), and Atomic Energy( 45 millions).(b) The deficit &quot; below the line &quot; both this year and next has been deliberatelyincreased by the provision of capital for the nationalised industries, ofwhich only coal was previously carried directly by the Exchequer. Theaddition is  350 millions in 1956, and will be about  400 millions inthe coming year. As I said in my Budget speech last April: &quot; Sodisappears by my own murderous act, my beautiful overall balance.&quot;This item has not really added to the charges on the Exchequer: it hassimply brought into the open the provision of Exchequer capital for public boards which was previously concealed. Under the previoussystem the Departments, financed from the Exchequer, took up the stocks issued by the public boards; and the Exchequer wasrecouped as and when the Departments sold the stocks in themarket. Now, the Exchequer finances the boards direct and isrecouped from the proceeds of its borrowing from the market and from the public. On the experience of the past year, I haveno doubt that the Exchequer has gained by the change. Ouropportunities for funding have been interrupted by Suez and othermarket disturbances, but we have done better in the market by sellingGovernment securities than if we had had to dispose of the stocks ofthe nationalised industries. On the other side of the medal, moreover,the transfer of loans to the local authorities from the Exchequer tothe market has been an outstanding success. In 1955-56 the Exchequerprovided  331 millions. For this year, we reduced the provision in theEstimates to  220 millions; but the pressure on the authorities hasbeen so effective that the amount we shall actually advance from theExchequer this year may be down to  120 millions. There have beenthree gains. The charge on the Exchequer has been reduced; thelocal authorities have attracted savings by their stock and mortgageissues; and the discipline of the market has, I believe, made a significant reduction -in the amount of their capital requirements.The Budgetary Problem5. It must be clear that the appearance at this time of figures for 1957-58,such as are forecast in paragraph 3, would have a disastrous effecton our position at home and abroad. The fall in the surplus &quot; above the line,&quot; caused entirely bythe increase in Departmental estimates, in spite of our battle for economies, means that the Government is spending more of the nation&apos;s money at a time when our economic situation requires that more of our resources should go to exports.6. The large increase in the amount which we shall have to find &quot; below theline &quot; is of perhaps less real significance, at least in the long run, since expenditurehere is largely on productive assets.  But the financing of this amount, against the consolidated FundDefenceCivil
background of a greatly reduced &quot; above-the-line &quot; surplus, must lead to a returnpi inflationary finance. Compared to this year, we would have to find a much larger sum through the issue of Treasury Bills, which find their way into banksand increase the credit base. This adds immensely to the task&apos; of maintaining our control over the monetary system.7. Moreover we cannot hope to reach an easy salvation by way of increased,savings. Last year was good from this point of view; but we cannot expect thesame support again. I called my Budget last April a &quot;Savings Budget&quot;; and indeed in the course of this year we have made exceptional efforts to finance theExchequer out of savings. For my colleagues will know that, if the&apos; Exchequerraises money by selling securities in the market or to the public, we are broadlyjustified in saying that the Exchequer is being financed out of savings; or at leastwe can say that these forms of financing offset the increase in the money supply thatwould otherwise occur when the Exchequer spends the money so raised. Theconverse happens when the Exchequer raises finance by increasing the fiduciarynote issue or by adding to the outstanding Treasury Bills, which in effect are taken up, not by the public but by the banks. Then the spending by the Exchequer isnot offset by the public saving. This form of financing, indeed, generates increases in the money supply by increasing the bankers&apos; liquidity.8. To a large extent, our efforts in the savings field have succeeded. with three months of the year to go, there are still hazards ahead. It looks, however, as though we shall finish the year with some reduction in the floating debt, afterfinancing not only the capital advances from the Exchequer to the public boards and other &quot; below-the-line &quot; customers, but also the repayment of the  824 millionsNational War Bonds that matured last August. To some extent this result is dueto an unfortunate cause that we shall not want to repeat the Exchequer derivedas much as  180 millions from the sale of our gold and dollar reserves. In addition,however, we have made and are making good use of our funding opportunities that is, sales of Government securities in the market. Above all, we have gained by the revival of small savings that is, the sales to the public of the new national savings securities in my Budget &quot; package &quot; the new Defence Bond, the newCertificate since August and the Premium Savings Bond since November.9. The results in this field, for the nine months of this year, show animprovement of some  120 millions over the same period in 1955. This isencouraging and a great assistance to me in the management of the Exchequer.But as I have said, next year we cannot rely on the same support from this source.For this year we have had the benefit of the impact on the public of three newsecurities bearing higher yields than have ever been paid on National Savings,combined with the entirely new feature of the Premium Bond. Next year we shall of course press on with the sales of these securities; but they will have lost theirnovelty and we are bound to have some repayments of Premium Bonds to finance.10. Similarly, I might have hoped, if all went well, for a movement some time this year to somewhat cheaper money and a reduction in the charge on the consolidated Fund. But cheaper money can only be the prize of solvency, notthe means to achieve it.11. To sum up, I am sure that we have been right to mobilise our reserves.But I could not agree to use them to defend, month by month, a sterling rate whichis continually threatened by doubts about our ability to manage our own finance&quot;3.This would not be an honourable course for Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers to follow.As the Governor of the Bank of England has warned me, &quot; unless radical measures are taken early, we shall drift (and drift rather quickly) to a position where the currency cannot be held and our way of life will&apos; be changed.&quot;The balance of payments problem12. To complete the picture, I feel that I should give some account of theprospects and needs for our balance of payments.13. We shall have had a surplus on external current account in 1956 of about 200 millions. But for the year July 1956 to June 1957 it is unlikely to be betterthan in bare balance-a surplus of perhaps  50 millions in the second half of1956 being offset by a deficit of the same order in the first half of 1957. this change in our prospects will include a substantial switch from payments for oil in sterling to payments in dollars.51001
14. The out-turn for 1956 will be an improvement on 1955. But it will be nothing like as good as it should be in a year when conditions, both internal and external, were favourable to our balance of payments. To meet our commitmentswe have said that we need on the average a surplus of  300-350 millions a year;this means that in a good year it must be bigger. In the good year of 1956 oursurplus is likely to be about half what it ought to have been.15. It is indeed a question whether an average surplus of  300-350 millionsis still good enough. We have had to borrow to meet the cost of the closing ofthe Suez Canal and the pipeline. To the extent that our borrowing has been to meet the outflow of funds due to lack of confidence, we can hope that someof the funds will flow back when confidence is restored and so provide the meansof repaying the borrowing. But the additional burden put on our economy bythe closing of the Suez Canal and the pipeline is something which we can onlypay off by our own efforts. Our borrowings to pay for oil can only be repaidby surpluses earned in the future. Then we have to recognise that parts of the sterling area which are still holding quite substantial balances have development programmes now getting under way. They will therefore be drawing on theirbalances to finance those programmes, as for example India is doing already. here is an obligation which we cannot avoid. Again, since the war the sterling balances of the Colonies have risen steadily; but we cannot be sure that as the Coloniesreach independence and Malaya and the Gold Coast are very near-they willbe either able or willing to continue to increase their holdings of sterling. All inall we must expect additional strain from reductions in sterling holdings withinthe sterling area.16. Finally, recent events have shown only too clearly the inadequacy of our reserves in relation to our position as banker. If sterling is to retain the confidence of the world, as it must if we are not to be faced with constant crises due to rumoursabout our ability to hold the rate, it must be seen to be supported by reserves which are more adequate in relation to our liabilities than they have been at anytime since the war. The only way to build up the reserves is to earn externalsurpluses.17. For all these reasons I think that our average surplus year in year out should be well above  300-350 millions. And this can only be done if the internal economy is kept in hand.The imperative need for reductions in expenditure &quot; above-fhe-line &quot;18. There is a story of the last Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, whodissipated a vast fortune. His advisers urged some retrenchment in his householdexpenditure. &quot; We quite understand why Your Grace requires an English cookand his staff for roasts; and a French cook and his staff for sweets. But is theItalian cook really necessary?&quot; To this the Duke replied: &quot;What! can&apos;t a fellowhave a biscuit with a glass of sherry?&quot; Similarly, every Minister, in forwardinghis estimates to the Treasury, has an overwhelming case to argue. We had a rather melancholy experience in the search for the  100 millions economy lastyear. We got, in the end,  93 millions. But the come-back by Departments hasbeen overwhelming witness the increased demand for  280 millions for nextyear all alleged to be indispensable on Civil account, with a  1,550 millionsasked for by the Service Departments.19. The upshot of all this, as I have said, is that with taxation at its present level, we must expect an above-the-line surplus of only  186 millions. (This is to be compared with my Budget estimate of a  460 millions surplus and a probableout-turn of  329 millions in the current year.) And I estimate a deficit below-the-lineof  750 millions (against  681 millions for this year) and a total over-all deficit of well over  500 millions (against  352 millions this year).20. The general economic situation up to Suez had shown a very moderateeasing in response to our disinflationary policy. We now have to deal both with anadded burden on our balance of payments, and with some dislocation of productioncaused by the interruption of oil supplies, which will affect both output andtransport.21. I shall have to deal with this in my Budget, according to my judgment of developments between now and then.  But it is clear that we must do much better
than the figures which I have already given. I am convinced that taxation is alreadytoo high: it is stifling enterprise and destroying the urge to work and save. I must ask my colleagues, therefore, in considering this very serious situation, to acceptthe imperative necessity of reducing the burden of expenditure by very largereductions of the Estimates now presented for my approval.The &quot; Below-the-Line &quot; Deficit22. The unsatisfactory position above-the-line highlights the other big Budgetproblem-the below-the-line deficit. The estimated out-turn for 1956-57 is 681 millions. And for 1957-58, we must provide for  750 millions.23. This is really the problem of how investment in the public sector is to be financed. Of this  750 millions, no less than  560 millions represents the cashrequirements for capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and the PostOffice, and  140 millions represent loans to local authorities and advances to theNew Town Corporations for capital expenditure.24. How far this can be provided without inflation depends upon a great many other factors one of which of course is the demand made by private investmentupon the nation&apos;s savings. It is too early to assess this quantitatively. But I should put to my colleagues now some considerations that seem to me important, whichI hope to develop in more detail shortly.25. It is now common ground that we must devote much more effort to building up our economic strength more productive investment and more for thebalance-of-payments. We have clearly not done enough in the last decade. Allthe signs point to increasing industrial challenge from the European free trade area, from the industrialising Commonwealth, from the Soviet bloc, and of coursefrom the United States.26. We therefore need an articulated and positive investment policy. Indeed,this seems to me indispensable. This must cover productive investment both in thepublic sector the basic provision of energy and essential services and in theprivate sector which drives the economy forward.27. It follows from this that we will wish to stimulate productive private investment again, certainly in some directions. Desirable as this is, it wouldmake the Budgetary problem worse. We might lose revenue; and the private sector would certainly be taking more of the available savings, increasing thedifficulty of financing the public sector.28. How then would we tackle the public seetor&apos;s problem and thebelow-the-line deficit? It would be inconsistent to skimp in productive public investment, though I must ask my colleagues&apos; support for cutting down relativelynon-productive investment within our control. We should save something, butnot enough to alter the scale of the problem.   This leads to two questions.29. First, can we reduce the nationalised industries&apos; requirements for exchequer finance? It is no use, at least at present, to suggest putting them backon the market. That only means that the Exchequer must finance them by taking up their securities. As things are now, it is unrealistic to suppose that there is any outside source other than the Exchequer from which the public boards canraise capital of this order of magnitude. But can we make them finance a much larger share of their capital needs from their internal resources that is, by more&quot; plough back &quot; of revenue, as the oil companies and the basic industries underprivate enterprise do? It would mean dearer coal, electricity, transport, telephonecharges, &amp;c. We should have to develop this carefully in relation to wage-and-price policy. &apos; There would be great gains, as well as obvious disadvantages^30. Second, do we get good value for money? The Fleck report on coal and the Herbert report on electricity emphasised these undertakings&apos; weakness in formulating and executing capital expenditure programmes. How can we ensureeffective control?   It would be most rash to embark upon expansion without this.31 These are two problems that we must somehow solve. If we are toadopt a forward-looking investment policy, we must at all costs avoid the doublemistake of failing to see that the financial resources and the physical resources areavailable to carry it out, and of being unable to ensure that it will in fact be carriedout effectively. Otherwise, we shall not only endanger the programme itself, butalso the balance of payments.
32. Should we not therefore simultaneously cut back the less productive investment, public and private? I shall make some proposals in the public sector.Within the private sector, would it not be wise to seek a further reduction in private house-building (and in local authority house-building too)? Is there any&quot; betterway, apart from this and apart from a reduction of the demand which the defence programme makes on the Economy, to make room for more productive investment?33. If housing is to be further reduced, I do not believe that it is politicallypossible to do this without taking powers to reintroduce building controls.Whether it would prove necessary to use these would be a matter of judgment atthe time as to the impact of the new investment programmes on the resources available. This would be all the more important if we were able to let up on the monetary side.34. I shall within the next few weeks put proposals on this range of investment questions to my colleagues. I feel strongly that we must have a positive and forward-looking policy of national rehabilitation, and an imaginativere-deployment of resources. But I am sure that we should be wrong to put thisforward without having a coherent procedure for cutting other public and private investment back and restraining consumption, in order to make room for theexpansions.Conclusion35. If we are to restore the strength of our Government and our party, andmobilise the underlying sense of unity of the nation, we must take the country into our confidence. They must know what we are trying to do and by what means.They must not merely accept our policy as inevitable. They must have faith in itas imaginative and inspiring. We must show them the end, as well as the means.It is clear that we must make rapid and perhaps far-reaching decisions in everyfield of policy -foreign, defence, trade, financial, economic and, perhaps, in theorganisation of the governmental machine.36. For my part I have put some emphasis on investment matters, althoughthe ideas are not yet properly formulated, because I believe that they present thebasis of such a forward-looking and constructive policy as can provide theinspiration which we must find. But the economic development and the nationalrehabilitation which we seek can only come to fruition on the basis of a firmeconomic structure, with a strong pound, and in an atmosphere of confidence, athome and, particularly, abroad. This sound base in its turn can only be created by our achieving a satisfactory surplus above the line, by achieving that is to saysubstantial economies in Government expenditure, both civil and defence. It is forthis reason particularly that the Budget prospect (outlined in paragraphs 2-19above) must be regarded as so disturbing. For unless something can be done to put it right, and some major economies made, we are in imminent danger of earlyeconomic disaster. We shall then lose, perhaps for ever, the opportunity of creating a situation in which the country can move forward.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1957.
