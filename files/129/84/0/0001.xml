confidential cp,(56) 251 COPY NO.30th October, 1956.CABINETGIBRALTAR:   COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE for industrial workers memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for air in CP.(56) 216 the Foreign Secretary and the colonial secretary urge that Spanish and Gibraltarian workers in Gibraltarshould be paid the same cost-of-living allowances.     Basic wages are the same but the present rates of cost-of-living allowances are48s. per week for British subjects and 24s. for aliens.2. We are against abolishing the differentials and cannot seethat there is anything to gain by modifying it  at the present time.3.        The philosophy on which the proposal to abolish the differential is based is &quot;the rate for the job&quot;.    The Spaniard in hisov/n country, however, lives differently from the Gib Tartarian and the1954 enquiry into living costs v/as unrealistic in that it ignored this fact.     In any event, the Spaniards who cross the frontier each daycan buy certain essentials, such as fruit and vegetables more cheaplythan the Gibraltarian.    Thus equality of wages would provide the spaniards with a higher real income.4.        Nor is it certain that the abolition of the differential could bemaintained.    The Gibraltarians would resent the payment of wages tothe Spaniards which enabled them to enjoy a superior standard ofliving;   and the mere act of bringing the Spaniards&apos; total pay up toparity would probably send up the cost of living in Gibraltar itself.The Gibraltar cost-of-living index rose by 7 points between October 1955and April 1956.    The major contributory cause v/as almost certainly ageneral increase of wages last December, in which the Spaniards sharedequally with the Gibraltarians.     One result was that the city council had to increase the rates,    Since the Spaniards constitute about halfthe labour force, a further substantial increase, even though confined to them, could hardly fail to increase costs for the residents of theColony.5.        The abolition of the differential would at once add  150,000 ayear to defence costs and might ultimately cost more in view of theprobable chain reaction on the Gibraltarians explained in the previous paragraph.    The Spanish Governments restrictions on the supply oflabour have not so far caused the Service Departments any serious difficulty.     Initially, therefore- expenditure devoted to the abolition ofthe differential would be nugatory.     Even supposing it produced an
agreement by the Spanish Government to lift the present restrictions,there would be no guarantee that these would not be re-imposed on somepretext or other whenever a policy of annoyance suited the SpanishGovernments book.6.        Nor have the Service Departments, who are the largestemployer of Spanish labour in Gibraltar,, any evidence that the present state of affairs causes dissatisfaction among the workers.    This isnot surprising since their wages compare very favourably with thosein Spain.    The comparison is shown in Appendix I.    If the differentialwere abolished, the Spaniards would all get an increase of 24s. a week;this would be on top of increases ranging upwards from 17s. grantedonly last December.To sum up, we consider(a) that a differential is justified;(b) that its abolition might have to be followed by the granting of a new lead for Gibraltarians;(c) that abolition would bring no immediate return of real value and no lasting return commensurate with the cost;(d) that to increase defence costs unnecessarily isquite the wrong oolicy at the present time.8.        We see less objection to the proposal that the amount of the differential should be reviewed in the light of a comparison of livingcosts on either side of the frontier though we think it will be verydifficult to establish a true comparison.    All the same, for reasonsmade clear above., we believe that if this resulted in a reduction ofthe differentials an unnecessary burden would be laid on Service votes.As C.Po(56) Z16 admits, the Spanish Government are not likely to be moved by this limited concession.    Moreover once it was announcedthat we v/ere making such an investigation it might well unsettle ourworkers and lead them to expect more than turned out to be justified.This would be a situation the Spanish Government could easily exploitto cause trouble.    If, however, our colleagues decide in favour of thiscourse, we. must urge that the comparison should be based on actualliving costs.9.        Assuming that the differential continues in any form, we are anxious, as we have long been, that its basis should immediately be changed from one of nationality to one of residence.    This would givethe Spaniards living in Gibraltar a higher cost-ef-living allowance andwould deprive the Spanish Government of the propaganda point that weare indulging in racial discrimination.10, In Appendix II we list certain minor comments on C0F,(56) 216and C0P.(56) 220,H.J ,H0N.B..30th October,, 1956.

DETAILED  .O0MMMTB   once, (56) 216 and CP, (56) 220The labour restrictions introduced in 1954 have not so farcaused the Service Departments serious difficulty.     If in the longer term they should lead to serious difficulties, the remedy might be to plan a gradual reduction in commitments.     This may in any case benecessary in the present atmosphere of financial stringency.     It isquestionable therefore whether the labour restrictions could in practiceinvolve us in heavy expenditure in Gibraltar,     The housing schemereferred to in C.P0 (56) 220 can hardly he regarded as having any practical basis involving as it does the building of blocks 12 to 15storeys high at a cost of much more than  lij, million,2.     Recently even the Spanish Government seem to have put verylittle emphasis on the cost of living differential.     We note the statement that the Spanish Government have recently indicated that they are preparedto consider concessions over labour supply in the context of the talks on social insurance.     No mention of the differential appears to have beenmade in this connection.3.     The last sentence of paragraph 4 of the Annex to CP. (56) 216distorts the views expressed by the Governor in August 1954.     In fact weunderstand the Governor&apos;s advice was that relations with Spain have,as you know, changed radically in the last three months and I do not think the question of the differential should be raised in any form in presentcircumstances.     To announce anything short of total abolition would merelybe unnecessarily to provoke a hornet&apos;s nest and. there should in my view beno question of total abolition, until the Spanish Government has called offits policy of economic strangulation.     I am therefore opposed to any concession at this stage. &quot;4.     The Admiralty&apos;s information is that the generality of good private employers in Gibraltar do not pay Spaniards and Gibraltarians the same rates
