secret,P.(56) 27610th December, 1956.CABINETNEW ZEALAND HOUSEMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food the New Zealand Government on 4th December appliedformally for the consent of the Commissioners of Crown Lands toa design for the new New Zeals.nd House to be built on the CarltonHotel site.     The Commissioners will be handing over their responsibility for the Crown Estate to the new board of Crown EstateCommissioners on 14th December.     It is, in my view, desirablethat, if possible, a decision in principle on the New zealand governments application should be taken before that date.2. This matter has already been before my colleagues on several occasions and there is, therefore, no need to recapitulateits history. Briefly, there have been altogether three designs byProfessor Matthew for the proposed building:-A. The original design, rising to a height of 275 ft. , whichwas objected to by the Commissioners and the RoyalFine Art Commission (R.F.A.C.).B. The revised design, rising to a height of 204 ft. and prepared in the light of a formula which I approvedafter consultation with the Minister of Housing andthe Minister of Works.    The base of this proposedbuilding was approved by the R.F.A.C. but, whileagreeing to the tower, they objected to its heightand bulk.C. The modified original design, rising to a height of207 ft. (i.e. design A but with the top storeys ofthe tower and the turret, amounting to 68 ft. inheight, removed).     This design has only beenput forward by the New Zealand Government atthe last moment, and has not yet been consideredby any authority.     A photograph of a model of thisdesign is attached.     (Photographs of models ofdesigns A and B above were attached with.P.(56) 51 and 132, respectively).It is design C which has now been put formally before theCommissioners of Crown Lands for approval, and for which theNew Zealand Prime Minister and his Cabinet are said to have astrong preference.COPY NO.
1:2.43.        Since the Home Affairs Committee last considered thematter, the New Zealand Government have, by arrangement withthe Commissioners, published designs B and C,     The Press reactionso far has been limited and comparatively mild, but such opinion as has been expressed has been generally in favour of Professor Matthew&apos;sdesigns.    The matter is due to be considered by the planning committee of the JL. C. C. on 19th December.    The R.F.A.C., whoare meeting on 12th December, are being informed by the NewZealand Government that it is design C which has now been submittedformally to the Commissioners, and their comments upon this designare being invited.4. From the United Kingdom point of view, I think the reviseddesign (3 above) is to be preferred on the ground, principally, thatit embodies modifications to the base of the building intended tomeet objections to the base in the original design.    It is, I think,reasonable to suppose that the R.F.A.C. will object to design C no less strongly than they objected to design B in view of the comparable height and greater bulk of its tower.    Against these considerations are the following facts.     First, it is design C whichthe New Zealand Government apparently prefer and have decidedto submit formally, and whose rejection v/ould undoubtedly causethem further annoyance.    Secondly, it has been indicated informally to the Commissioners by the New Zealand authorities that, ifdesign .3 were again to come up for serious consideration, theNew Zealand Government would almost certainly press for theaddition of three extra floors to the tower which would increase theheight of the building by 3 6 ft. to a total height of 240 ft.    Any suchpressure would, in my view, have to be resisted.5.        My colleagues are aware that the New Zealand government feel most strongly on this matter, on which they have asked for theearliest possible decision.     Taking all things into consideration,my recommendations are as follows.      I am prepared to recommendmy colleagues to approve in principle the erection of a tall building(not higher than 210 ft. ) on this site provided that the L.C.C decidegenerally in favour of Professor Matthew&apos;s designs for a tallbuilding.    As between designs B and C, I should be ready torecommend immediate approval of design B, subject to furtherconsideration of architectural detail and internal lay-out, and tothe necessary technical scrutiny.    Before making any recommendation on design C, I   should wish to have the opportunity of consideringthe R,F.A.C,&apos;s views upon it.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W.I.10th December, 1956.
