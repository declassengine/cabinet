THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1957SECRET Copy No,CP. (57) 1110th January, 1957CABINETREMUNERATION OF DOCTORSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of.health the Secretary of State for Scotland and I have had before us since Tune a claim for an increase of not less than 24 per cent, in the remuneration of all doctorsin the National Health Service, as from last April. Present levels were fixed forthe general practitioners in 1951 (by the Danckwerts adjudication) and for hospital medical staff in 1954 (by negotiation). The new claim would involve about 20 millions a year.2. So far we have refused to discuss the merits of their claim. We havetaken the line that in present economic circumstances we cannot even consider it,whatever its merits may be (CM. (56) 49th Conclusions, Minute 2 refers).Obviously, however, it will be difficult or impossible to hold to this line indefinitelyand among the more reputable doctors it is becoming a crisis of confidence asmuch as of money. It is time to make up our minds what our longer-term policyis to be.3.   There are three possibilities:  (1) to offer now to consider the claim and to try to negotiate a settlement,perhaps to operate at a future date to be fixed. Quite apart fromstarting any offer in present circumstances, it seems unlikely that wecould justify an offer high enough to have any chance of being accepted.Negotiations would then break down and lead to a demand for either (2) a further arbitration on Danckwerts lines, covering, this time, hospitalstaff as well as general practitioners, or (3) an independent enquiry by referring the subject to some form of committee or commission.4. Tactically the best course seems to be to proceed straight to (3) ratherthan wait for the breakdown of negotiations. We should regard (2), arbitration,as the worst possible development, including a greater risk that the doctors wouldbe awarded all they are asking and probably with retrospective effect.5. As to the form of any enquiry, we should prefer a Royal Commission. a body of this standing might be less unacceptable to the doctors and could, more easily than a Departmental Committee, cover fields of remuneration outside theimmediate claim. The enquiry, we suggest, should cover dentists as well asdoctors and, in both professions, not merely those working in the National health service but all who are paid wholly or partly from public funds-under theMedical Research Council, the Universities, and the public health and school health services of local government. Presumably we should except the Civil Serviceand the Fighting Services, since they have been subject to recent settlements, butthe Commission would be able to take those settlements into consideration.51018
6. We must beware lest such a Commission should be allowed to becomesimply another Spens Committee. The weakness of the three Spens Committees(on the remuneration of general practitioners, consultants and specialists, and dentists in the National Health Service) was that (a) they reviewed medical and dental remuneration largely in isolation,without enough regard to the position of these professions in relationto others;(b) they did not secure a proper balance between the different branches of the professions; and above all(c) their recommendations were in terms of pre-war values and they left for negotiation the problem of adjustment of those values to currentconditions.7. Doctors and dentists cannot be considered in isolation from other professions with which they inevitably invite comparison. Nor can they be giventhe right, which they claim, to automatic adjustment of their remuneration whenever the cost of living rises. Their position must be looked at in relation not only tothat of other professions (such as the law, architecture, accountancy) but especially to those in which lay people are working alongside doctors and dentists, such asresearch and university teaching. . - .8. The Royal Commission would therefore need to take evidence, not only from the two professions, but also from other comparable professions and fromemploying authorities concerned with them. Its recommendations would haveto include both specific rates of pay for doctors and dentists and some reasonableappraisal of their positions in relation to other professions and other parts of the professions to which they themselves belong.    19. It is unlikely that the doctors would receive the proposal with enthusiasm.They are likely to regard it as a device to gain time and therefore to claim bothsomething on account and an assurance that any settlement should be made retrospective.* 10. This makes it necessary to consider whether we should, concurrently withsetting up the Commission, make a provisional offer for certain classes whoundoubtedly have a just claim (for example, junior hospital staff up to, say, the grade of senior registrar). It would be rather difficult to draw any logicallydefensible line: and any such offer might appear to be unfair to some general practitioners, both medical and dental, and the lower-paid research, university andlocal government staff. Nevertheless it would go some way to reducing the criticism that the Commission meant delaying the whole claim.11.   The doctors and dentists would be likely to try hard to widen the enquiry to include other issues beside pay.  This makes it all the more important to drawterms of reference with care.   We suggest the following:  :;v&quot;;  :  To consider the proper levels of total professional remuneration of thevarious sections of the medical and dental professions other than those inthe Fighting Services and the Civil Service (where remuneration is derivedwholly or partly from public funds) in relation both to each other and toother professions and connected occupations; to consider whether, and if so what, advisory machinery is needed for subsequent periodic review, andto make recommendations.12. The Spens Committees included a substantial number of professionalmembers who were thus put in the position of judging their own case. In the newenquiry we think that no doctors or dentists should be included in the Commission.The type of Commission we envisage is:  Chairman. A High Court Judge or Lord Justice of Appeal.(Lord Justice Morris would make an excellent chairman.)Members. A University member (non-medical or dental).A member of a county or county borough council.A barrister or solicitor.A retired Civil Servant (neither Treasury nor Health Department).A professional woman.A member from an independent profession e.g., engineer, actuary.Two or three non-professional people of standing including a TradesUnion Council representative.
13. If we decide to set up this enquiry before an announcement is made, weshall have to consult the appropriate bodies representing the universities and localgovernment. It would also be necessary to seek the support of the. Medical joint negotiating Committee and the British Dental Association.14.   We suggest, therefore (i) that the balance of advantage lies with continuing to resist the doctors&apos;immediate claim (on general economic grounds, not on merits) andundertaking to start at once a full-scale enquiry into both medical and dental remuneration, coupled with an offer of some increasedremuneration for certain classes of doctor who are admittedlyunderpaid at present.(ii) that the enquiry should be by a Royal Commission, covering not onlythe National Health Service but all doctors and dentists paid whollyor partly from public funds except those in the Civil Service and fighting Services.J. S.R. H. T.8th January, 1957.
