secret.Pc(56) 28011th December, 1956MANCHESTER&apos;S HOUSING NEEDSNote by the Secretary of the cabinet a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee, under the Chair-manship of the Lord Chancellor, have considered Manchester&apos;s housing needs and the arguments for and against proceeding with the proposeddevelopment at Lymm.2. It is now necessary to reach a decision quickly and I circulate forthe consideration of the Cabinet the report of the Sub-Committee togetherwith a memorandum giving the views of the Lord Chancellor.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W. I.10th December, 1956.COPY NO.CABINET
MANCHESTER&apos;S HOUSING NEEDSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor was unable to attend the last meeting of the Home Affairs Sub-Committee.    I have, therefore, not hea rdthe final arguments.    Theviews, however, that I had formed before the meeting are given below.2.      During the period 1961 to 1971 Manchester will have about 18,000sites available for houses, assuming that the borough council ofMacclesfield agree to the scheme for 4,500 houses at Macclesfield.3.      If the rate of building during this period is 3,000 houses a year there will be sufficient sites available until 1967.4.      We have therefore a breathing space which will permit us toexamine the position again in two or three years&apos; time.5.      To decide in favour of the Lymm proposal will -(a) Cause doubt and dismay to agriculture.(b) Ruin 3,100 acres of the best agricultural land and possibly a good deal more.6.      I think, therefore, that we should not decide in favour of the Lymmproposal now and that the position should be re-examined in two or threeyears&apos; time.     In the meantime vigorous efforts to find an alternativesolution should be made.K.House of Lords, S. W. 1.10th December, 1956.
MANCHESTER&apos;S HOUSING MEEDSReport by a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs CommitteePART I - THE PROBLEMI.      In 1953 Manchester Corporation applied for planning permission tobuild 10,500 houses at Mobberley and 12,000 houses at Lymra (both inCheshire).    The Minister of Housing rejected both applications in 1954.His rejection was unconditional as far as Mobberley was concerned.     Inthe case of Lymm, he said that there were formidable objections to develop-ment on agricultural grounds.    Although he recognised that it was easier to build on one large site rather than on several smaller ones, and that anumber of developments, some perhaps at a considerable distance, would entail difficulties, nevertheless he thought that Manchester would have to contemplate some decentralisation to places a long way out and that itwould be possible for Manchester to build a great many houses on some,at any rate, of the other sites which had been suggested.    He said that until these alternatives had been tried it could not be right to agree to theLymm proposal.2.      Manchester need about 80,000 new houses.     Of their existing houses68,000, or one third of the total, are slums - a higher proportion of slumsthan any other large English city.3.      Manchester&apos;s present rate of building is about 1,500 houses per year,having dropped from 2,600 a year in 1953.    They consider that, givensufficient sites to plan ahead for some years, they could build about,000 houses a year, and that they could achieve this level by 1961 and maintain it until 1971.    To do this would require sites for some 30,000houses over and above those to be built between now and the end of i960.4.      Since the rejection of the Lymm proposal, Manchester corporation and the adjoining county councils have made an intensive search for sites.Excluding Lymm, the sites now likely to be available between 1961 and1971 are sufficient, on the latest information, for 13,500 houses (subjectto the point made in paragraph 5).     On this figure the following factsshould be noted:-(a) Sites for 6,000 houses are inside Manchester.    Theyare mostly occupied slum property, which cannotbe demolished until new houses have been builtelsewhere for the displaced slum dwellers.(b) The sites outside Manchester are, in the main,comparatively small and scattered;  theCorporation v/ould be dependent for the provisionof water and sewerage on the district councils.Both these factors make it difficult to maintain a high rate of building.-1-
(c) The total includes sites for 1,000 houses at Glossop,Whether it will be possible to build on this scalewill depend on the outcome of a pilot scheme of250 houses which Manchester are willing to under-take in order to test whether this area would prove attractive to Manchester people.(d) Manchester are already building at a high density.To increase the density still further would have only a marginal effect on the problem.5.      In addition, Manchester are willing to undertake a scheme of4,500 houses at Macclesfield.     The borough council, however, have sofar refused to agree to this, but there is a possibility that they may in theend be persuaded to do so.     (A larger scheme for 10,000 houses atMacclesfield has been mentioned, but there seems no prospect of the borough council agreeing to this;  nor would Manchester regard it asfeasible, especially as it could well prove difficult to attract enoughindustry to provide work for so large an increase in population. )6.      The practicability of development outside the city depends not onlyon the willingness of other local authorities to make land available, butalso on the prospects of attracting sufficient industry to support the extrapopulation.     It is important that industry for this purpose should bedrawn from Manchester because otherwise the outflow of population would be offset - and the purpose of the overspill scheme defeated - bypeople moving in to Manchester to take up the employment vacanciescreated there.7.      Manchester have come to the conclusion that they cannot use theirbuilding resources to the full without one large scale development under their own control, and that Lymm (Cheshire) is the only suitable site.Lymm could provide 12,000 houses;   it would be easy to develop as a self-contained community;   Manchester themselves could provide water and sewerage.    They consider that they could build there at the rate of1,000 houses a year, and still utilise the sites mentioned in paragraph above.    Lymm is well situated for industrial development and, whilst the Board of Trade has doubts on the willingness of Manchester industryto move out of the city, it would probably be less unwilling to move toLymm than to the other areas that have been considered.8.      The possibility of a smaller scheme on the Lymm site has been mentioned.    No such proposal has been made by any of the local authorities.A smaller scheme would involve the same objections in principle from thepoint of view of agriculture, without sufficiently contributing to the solutionof Manchester&apos;s&apos; problem to justify undertaking it;   moreover, the opponents of development at Lymm would probably regard a smallerscheme as merely the thin end of the wedge.9.      There are several grounds for objection to Manchester&apos;s proposal(see Part III below) but the fundamental objection is that arising from theagricultural value of the Lymm site.    The 3.100 acres that would be takenis unquestionably some of the finest agricultural land in the country,containing some fifty holdings which are well  equipped and well farmed.Not only would this area of first-class land be lost if it were developed,but production on another large area of surrounding agricultural land of the same quality would be adversely affected by the proximity of thebuilt-up area.-2-
10.     The Minis+er of Housing is convinced that, without a large-scale development such as is proposed at Lymm, Manchester&apos;s efforts to dealwith their vast housing and slum clearance problem will be severelyretarded.11.     In the Minister&apos;s view, the main reason why Manchester&apos;s rate of house-building is now dropping is shortage of assured sites.    He has nodoubt that if enough sites were available they could build again at 3,000houses a year, as they did before the war.    It is not practicable to compelthem to build on sites which are unsuitable.    The Minister is satisfiedthat, following the 1954 enquiry, Manchester have genuinely tried the alternatives and have included in their programme every site whichis at all suitable.    The Minister is also satisfied that Manchester would develop Lymm as a self-contained community with the necessarycomplement of industry;  and approval of the scheme would be made conditional on this.12.     The Sub-Committee of Ministers agreed &quot;that the only sitescapable of development on a large enough scale to make a substantial contribution to Manchester&apos;s housing needs were Macclesfield and Lymm&quot;.(H. P. (M)(5 6) 1st Meeting.)    It has been suggested that, instead ofbuilding 12,000 houses at Lymm, an additional 5,500 houses should be built at Macclesfield.     (With the 4,500 houses previously proposed to be built there, this would make a total of 10,000 houses at Macclesfield. )However, for the reasons set out below, this proposal is not a promisingone.(a) The provision of an additional 5,500 houses atMacclesfield instead of 12,000 at Lymm would,of course, result in a reduction of 6,500 in thetotal number of houses provided for Manchester&apos;soverspill.(b) The Councils of both Manchester and Macclesfieldand the Board of Trade are all of them doubtfulwhether it would be possible to persuadesufficient industry from Manchester to move out to Macclesfield to justify its expansion on thescale suggested.(c) The scheme would entail nearly doubling the size of Macclesfield.     It would involve a majorexpansion of the existing water and seweragesystems, and the replanning and reconstruction of the town centre.    This task could obviouslyonly be undertaken with the agreement and active co-operation of the Macclesfield Council.     In fact,the Council have by a recent vote rejected eventhe smaller scheme for 4,500.     The possibilityof their being induced to adopt a scheme for10,000 houses is therefore remote.     Under theTown Development Act, Macclesfield could in theory be compelled to allow manchester corporation to come in and expand their townagainst their will.    But, they would have every opportunity for delay and obstruction and, carriedout in that spirit, the project would certainlyfail.
lay13.     The development at Lymm is of course also opposed by the localDistrict Council.   But the problem here is very different.   The projectat Macclesfield would entail the wholesale reshaping of a long-establishedtown with a distinct identity and tradition of its own.   Lymm on the otherhand is an almost wholly rural area with only about 2,000 houses, manyof them suburban villas occupied by business people from Manchester andMerseyside.14.    It has been suggested that a decision about Lymm might perhaps be postponed for a while; but, apart from the pressure in the House for astatement, this would be impossible to justify.   A large-scale project like this needs to be planned a long time ahead.   The statutory procedure for obtaining planning approval and the confirmation of Compulsory PurchaseOrders, including the necessary public enquiry could easily take a year.It would probably take a further four years to complete the purchase of theland, and to lay out and construct the roads, sewers, water supply, etc.which must be provided before house building can start.   It would be another year or two before the building rate reached its peak.15.    The Minister of Housing accordingly advises -(a) that, unless the Government are prepared to justify a considerable slowing down of Manchester&apos;s slum clearance, permission must be given for a large-scale development somewhere;(b) that the site at Lymm is the only practicable one; and(c) that a decision cannot any longer be postponed.16.    He accordingly asks his colleagues to agree that when Manchesterrenew their application for planning permission to build at Lymm heshould, subject to any new factors which may emerge at the public enquiry,approve the proposal.PART III - THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURES VIEWS17.    The Minister of Agriculture would stress that the arguments on therelative advantages of Lymm and other sites are, in the nature of things,speculative; but there is no question of the agricultural value of Lymm.It is the Governmenfs declared policy to preserve good agricultural land from development where land of less agricultural value could be used; andthe Governmenfs attitude on Lymm will be regarded by agriculturalopinion, both inside and outside the House, as the acid test of the government&apos;s sincerity.. 18.    It is, of course, true that, with a given area and building force,the rate of building will be greater on a single large site such as Lymmthan on a number of separate sites adjoining existing towns.   But ifplanning considerations are overwhelmingly against the use of the single site, it is suggested they must prevail.
i 9 n19.    The Minister notes that Manchester needs 80,000 houses andthat the programme proposed for 1961/71, including Lymm, would, evenif the proposed rate of building could be achieved, provide only 30,000houses.   Therefore, some ten years hence, when planning their programme for the next decade, Manchester will inevitably have to face the need todevelop areas which they have at present rejected.   It is suggested thatthey should face this need now; and that the best way of ensuring thatthey do so is finally to reject the proposal to develop Lymm.20.    Apart from the main agricultural issues, Manchester&apos;s proposalsseem open to doubt on the following general grounds.(a) Cheshire has cast doubt on Manchester&apos;s ability tobuild 3,000 houses a year and some colour is lentto this by the current rate of building.(b) While Macclesfield may be in a stronger position to resist than the local authorities concerned with Lymm,this should not be allowed to prejudice considerationof the alternatives from the Land Use aspect on their merits.(c) It is difficult to accept as final the reluctance of manchester industry to move to areas - say - twentyto twenty-five miles from the city as has been doneelsewhere.   Over a longer period, if Manchester&apos;total need is to be met, industry will undoubtedly haveto move further afield; or else the fears that the openland between the city and the new developments willitself become built up will be realised.(d) Lymm is near enough to Manchester to be used as adormitory.   Indeed, the Minister of Housing has said(HdP.(M)(56) 2nd Meeting) that it will be used in thisway while local industry is being built up.   There wouldseem a real risk that, whatever our intentions,Lymm would, if permission to develop were granted,become a dormitory for Manchester and not a self-contained community.21.    The objections on agricultural grounds are very strong indeed; but even apart from these, the case for developing at Lymm and not else-where does not seem to have been made out.   It would seem, in any case,that we are in no position to decide that permission to develop at Lymmshould now be given.   The most we could decide is that Manchester hasmade out a case for reconsideration of the decision reached, after a public enquiry, as recently as October 1954, and to arrange for the holding of afurther public enquiry with all the expense this would involve and the time it would occupy.   But in the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s view no case hasbeen made out for reversing the 1954 decision and the proposal should be rejected so that Manchester can devote its energies more fully toexploiting the possibilities of other sites.
