Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1956The circulation of-this paper has been strictly .limited.. It,is. issued for the personal use of .......... ....................................    ........top SECRET Copy No.C.A. (56) 3326th November, 1956CABINETColonial Policy CommitteeCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 3rd October the Cabinet invited the Colonial Policy Committee to consider,in the light of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s proposals for constitutional reform, the suggestions made by the Governor of Cyprus, Sir John Harding, in his telegram No. 1992 of2nd October (CM. (56) 68th Conclusions, Minute 2). (These suggestions were subsequently included in C.A. (56) 29.)lord RADCLIFFE&apos;S REPORT^ 2. Lord Radcliffe has now presented his report (circulated as CP. (56) 264).The House has been promised that we will publish it when we have studied it.3. In paragraph 2 of my C.A. (56) 29, I gave an outline of whatLord Radcliffe had told me he was likely to propose. He has not diverged in his report from the main features which I then summarised.Views on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report. I think that the general lines of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report are acceptable.They safeguard our strategic interests and they provide for what should be a workable constitution.5. He has rejected a bicameral constitution but he has devised a series ofingenious constitutional arrangements for protecting the interests of minorities.Our strategic needs are covered by the reservation of defence, foreign affairs and internal security. Although such a diarchy has elsewhere proved difficult to work,he has drawn on those lessons in his attempt to provide a form of diarchy that could work smoothly.6. Clearly no new constitution can be introduced and made to work withoutthe willing co-operation of the people of Cyprus. Led by the Ethnarchy, the traditional attitude of the Greek Cypriots to constitutional development ishostility. There are indications however that they may now be more willing than before to co-operate in working a constitution. Their main constitutional demand,viz., a Greek Cypriot elected majority, will have been met in the Radcliffe plan.But their attitude may depend largely on that of Archbishop Makarios. Although50813 b
we cannot assess what this will be, he will try to take advantage of the occasionin order to secure his own release and return to Cyprus; and will try to put pressure on the Greek Government to this end.7. The Turkish Government and Turkish Cypriots will not like the proposedconstitution. It does not concede the Turkish Cypriots&apos; demand for equality withthe Greek Cypriot community. Also, the Turkish Government continue to claim that it is inappropriate to make any. announcement of a constitution whilstterrorism continues. Indeed, they are opposed to any constitution because they regard it as fikely to bring Enosis nearer.8. The Greek Government are not opposed to a constitution as such andwill welcome Lord Radcliffe&apos;s decision in favour of a Greek Cypriot electedmajority. But they continue to hold that a constitution will be acceptable only ifaccompanied by definite arrangements for self-determination. Their preciseattitude may depend upon that of Archbishop Makarios.Financial Proposals9. Lord Radcliffe proposes that the United Kingdom should pay part of thecost of prisons and police services (the latter include normal fire services and exclude civil defence and emergency fire services) and the whole cost of inter-communal education. His arguments for these proposals are in paragraphs 57,59 and 60 of the introduction to his report. My comments, which cover a numberof points raised in a talk which Lord Radcliffe and I had with the FinancialSecretary, are in the Annex, which the Treasury have seen in draft.Date of Publication and Announcement10. In C.A. (56) 29 I concluded that the decision on timing of publicationof the report must be left over until the report was ready, when all factors affectingpublication could be taken into account, including the security situation at thattime, and the presentation of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments case over Cyprus atthe United Nations. I also emphasised that its publication could be construed as a positive step towards the end of the emergency in Cyprus and that it would havea bad effect if it were known that the report had been presented but that we wereunduly delaying its publication. I explained that I was therefore proceeding onthe assumption that the report, and a statement of the Governments policy on it,would be published before the Christmas recess. Since C.A. (56) 29 was written,our action in Egypt has had its repercussions in Cyprus. I nevertheless still feelthat we should continue to aim at a statement before the Christmas recess.Announcement of Views on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s Report11. I propose that, in our statement of views on the report, we should announce that we accept the framework of this new constitution as proposed byLord Radcliffe, and will be prepared to introduce it when law and order have been restored. We shall take into account any constructive suggestions made on thedetails of the proposals, with a view to including them in the new constitution,if this can be done without departing from the general principles laid down byLord Radcliffe. Our statement on this point might go on to say that instructions have been given to the legal draftsmen to begin preparation of the necessary Orderin Council, and that the Cyprus Government has been asked to put in hand thework necessary for delimiting constituencies and preparing electoral rolls with aview to elections being held as soon as conditions permit.IISELF-DETERMINATION12. Sir John Harding is strongly of the opinion that we should make some statement on self-determination at the same time as publishing Lord RadcliflVsreport. He hopes that our constitutional proposals together with a statement onself-determination will enable us to secure the co-operation of the Greek and turkish Governments in a permanent settlement. I agree that we should take theopportunity to make a comprehensive statement of policy and that we should try to get the Greek and Turkish Governments at least to acquiesce in it.
13. The question is whether we can go beyond our present position, i.e.,recognition of the principle of self-determination but refusal to give any undertakingon how and when it can be applied to Cyprus. Sir John Harding has recentlyindicated that a reaffirmation of this position might be sufficient. He may howeverrevert to the proposal for a tripartite treaty with Greece and Turkey, or somevariant of it.14. It is evident from the Turkish Governmenfs attitude (paragraph 7 above)that, if we go significantly further than our present position on self-determination,they will refuse all co-operation with us in the Cyprus question. They might,indeed, reconsider their general Middle Eastern policy. I believe that this is a risk which we cannot accept. The Turkish Government have raised the idea of partition. This is not attractive in itself but it may have advantages as one element in a general settlement.15.. H.M. Ambassador at Athens has indicated that the Greek government itself might be prepared to acquiesce in a reaffirmation of our present position onself-determination. However, their attitude will be largely determined by thatof Makarios and he will try, at first at any rate, to secure something further.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have explicitly accepted the principle of self-determination. They have also declared their willingness to discuss the fixture ofthe Island with Cypriot representatives once self-government is workingsuccessfully. This declaration might now be carried a stage further by announcingthat, when the international situation permits, and when the constitution has been introduced and self-government is working satisfactorily, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to review all aspects of the situation with elected representatives of the people of Cyprus: further, when the time comes for this review, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to ensure that any application ofthe principle of self-determination should apply to the Turkish Cypriot equally with the Greek Cypriot community; and would not exclude the possibility of apartition of the Island from the discussion. I will nearer the time tell my colleaguesexactly what I would like to say in announcing this in the House.16. A statement in such terms, though it would not fully satisfy either theGreek or the Turkish Government, would nevertheless (a) be difficult for the Greeks to reject;(b) by allowing for eventual partition, afford the Turks the one safeguardwhich might reconcile them to the exercise of self-determination;(c) cause Greek Cypriots to reconsider the merits of the status quo.IllAMNESTY17. Sir John Harding suggested that our statement of policy should alsosay that once the constitution had been introduced the Governor would discussterms of an amnesty with the Chief Minister. There might be advantage insomething being said about an amnesty, but I am not convinced that this should necessarily be said in our Parliamentary statement, nor that it would be best inthe form suggested by the Governor. It might be better dealt with by way of localannouncement. As regards the Governor^ suggestion that the matter of an amnesty should wait over until a Chief Minister had been appointed, it seems tome that.there,would be advantage in not tying ourselves down to any particularevent; it might well prove better to get the issue of an amnesty out of the wayat an earlier stage.IVOTHER MATTERSAction with the Turkish Government18.   H.M. Ambassador at Ankara, with the concurrence of the Governor,has advised that the,Turkish Government should be given a fortnight to studyLord Radcliffe&apos;s report and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs views thereon. Provided50813 B 2
H.M. Ambassador considers that the Turks are likely to accept the principles on which our statement is based, this course has much to recommend it. If,however, the Turks are likely to raise fundamental objections I think we should avoid placing ourselves in the position of having to disregard their consideredcomments. In that case, I suggest they should be given one or two days&apos; advancenotice only; but that it be explained to them that it would be possible for them tomake their views known to us after publication, so that account would be taken of any views they might express before final decisions are reached.Action with the Greek Government19. H.M. Ambassador at Athens proposes that the Greek Governmentshould have only brief advance notice. There is a serious danger of leaks inAthens. Moreover the Greeks are unlikely to take a firm position until they know that of Archbishop Makarios. But it will help them with Greek public opinionif it can be made to appear that they have been consulted. I therefore suggestthat they be given up to two days&apos; notice, but in any case not more than that givento the Turks.Action with the United States Government20. The United States Government have asked to be informed in advanceof our intentions. Although they have not hitherto been helpful, their attitudewill certainly have some effect on the Greek Government. I therefore considerthat we should show our statement and Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report to the United StatesGovernment at the same time as we show them to the Turkish Government. TheUnited States Government could then be urged to use its influence as necessary with both the Greek and Turkish Governments.Consultation with Archbishop Makarios21. There is no doubt that any expression of the Archbishop&apos;s views on lord Radcliffe&apos;s proposals would greatly affect the reactions of both the GreekGovernment and Greek Cypriots. It is just possible that he may decide to takethe occasion of the publication of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ statement of policy to indicate that he is prepared to advise GreekCypriots to co-operate in constitutional development. The Governor and I feel,however, that it would appear as if we were reopening negotiations with the archbishop if we attempted to consult him in advance. If there were any questionof so consulting him, I have no doubt that this would adversely affect the TurkishGovernment^ reactions, as well as having adverse effects upon public opinion inthis country. I have therefore sent the Governor of Seychelles an advance copyof Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report and propose to send him our draft statement of policywhen we have decided on that. I have in mind that Lord Radcliffe&apos;s secretary and a Greek-speaking officer should be available in Seychelles, in order to explainthese documents to the Archbishop as soon as they are published.Future of Archbishop Makarios22. If the Archbishop were subsequently to indicate that he would be readyto advise Greek Cypriots to co-operate in introducing the constitution, we could then consider whether any statement that he was prepared to make should bepublished and perhaps taken into account in the Parliamentary debate which wouldcertainly follow Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ statement.23. It may prove that the Archbishop will ask for consultation with GreekCypriots before agreeing to comment on the constitutional proposals and statementof policy. I feel that there may be advantage in agreeing to this, and we shouldnot rule it out a priori.24. Sir John Harding had proposed that the statement of policy should include a passage referring to the conditions under which Archbishop Makarioswould be released from detention and would be allowed to return to Cyprus. TheGovernor thinks that, while he should be allowed to leave Seychelles when theemergency is over, he should not be allowed to return to Cyprus until theconstitution is working satisfactorily. It may however be wiser not to commit ourselves in public when we announce our view on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report.
RECOMMENDATIONS25.   I recommend that: -(a) we should aim to publish Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report before the christmas recess (paragraph 10);(b) a statement of the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be preparedalong the lines indicated in paragraphs 11 and 15 above;(c) the Turkish, Greek and United States Governments should be shown thereport and informed of the substance of Her Majesty&apos;s governments views shortly before publication and Archbishop Makarios should be shown them immediately after publication (paragraphs 18-21); and(d) we should accept the Governors view that the Archbishop might beallowed to leave Seychelles at the end of the emergency, but not allowedto return to Cyprus until after the introduction of the constitution, but should not refer to this in our statement on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s report.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.I,23rd November, 1956.ANNEXComments on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s financial proposals (paragraphs 57, 59 and 60 ofLord Radcliffe&apos;s Covering Note)It is not possible to say precisely what financial commitment the acceptanceof Lord Radcliffe&apos;s proposals would involve for Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Inthe first place, no decisions have yet been taken about the size of the police forceafter the emergency is over, nor is it known to what extent additional facilities forinter-communal education will have to be provided. To some extent the size ofthe capital cost will be within Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs control and annual expenditure on capital account can thus be adapted to meet changing circumstances.In the second place, Lord Radcliffe has made only a tentative suggestion about the share of police costs which should be met by the self-governing side, and I would regard his figure as open to further discussion. Subject to these uncertainties and assuming that the new Constitution comes into force next year, I should not expectour capital commitment to be more than a total of  -  million for the police and atotal of about  1-J- million for inter-communal education up to 1961; our share ofrecurrent costs might rise from about  2 million to a maximum of about  3 million per annum for both services over the same period.2. Lord Radcliffe&apos;s proposals are unorthodox and he has made them in thefull knowledge of the established principle of giving assistance to colonial territories from the United Kingdom budget only on grounds of proved need. Herecognises that Cyprus revenues, which have recently been increasing at the rate ofabout  1 million per annum, are likely to go on rising, at least until 1961. his proposals would relieve the self-governing budget of a current charge of about 1-5 million per annum (apart from any drop in emergency expenditure from which that budget might benefit). However, expenditure on the self-governing side is also likely to go up and, as Cyprus will probably not be able to raise external loans for development, she will have to rely on local resources, including revenuesurpluses, for this purpose. Thus the possibility of the self-governing side being able, under the Radcliffe plan, to accumulate substantial surplus balances is remote.3. In any event, Lord Radcliffe has told me that he regards his proposals inrespect of expenditure on the police and on inter-communal education as an integral part of his plan and that he is convinced that any radical departure from them would vitiate the whole basis of his carefully studied proposals. So far asrepercussions in Cyprus are concerned, he considers that, while no financial settlement that can be devised would be completely watertight against pressuresfor enlarging the field of United Kingdom assistance, his proposals go as far as ishumanly possible to limit this danger.   They appear to him to provide a strong
moral ground for standing firm, as suggested in paragraph 60 of his covering note,against demands from the self-governing side to extend the amount or the scopeof budgetary assistance from United Kingdom funds.  I agree with this view.4. I have also naturally had to consider whether there would be likely to berepercussions elsewhere if we accept Lord Radcliffe&apos;s financial proposals forCyprus. I am satisfied that such repercussions are not to be feared so far as concerns the sharing of police costs. I can foresee that a similar arrangement might become necessary in Aden, whether or not a precedent had been set in Cyprus; butin no other territory is the local government likely to agree to surrender completelyits control of its police. From this point of view, Lord Radcliffe&apos;s proposals for financing inter-communal education present greater difficulty. I would expectconsiderable pressure on us from the Opposition to pay for inter-communaleducation in East Africa once the principle had been conceded in Cyprus, but i see no reason why such an extension of the principle should be conceded purelyon the grounds of precedent. There is, of course, a danger that our departure fromorthodoxy in Cyprus will encourage fresh financial demands on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment but I doubt whether it would significantly affect our total Colonialcommitment or the way in which that commitment has to be met.5. I myself believe that Lord Radcliffe&apos;s financial proposals are not only an integral part of the constitutional pattern he has devised, but take account of theproblem of getting a workable diarchy, and also of the emotional complex in cyprus. Cypriots have always held that Britain has never put as much back intothe Island as it took out in early years under the Turkish Tribute. Inter-communaleducation is particularly vital if we are to have any chance of winning Cypriotsround to keeping up the British connection. Cypriot Ministers will be too muchunder the influence of the Orthodox Church ever to give decent education a fairrun. To my mind, the only alternatives are to pay for what we want ourselves, orto organise it and take the money, or a share of it, by precept out of the Cyprusbudget. The latter might work, although it would impose strains on the newconstitution. But it is not the proposal that Lord Radcliffe is going to publish,and I should like to see his financial proposals adopted as they stand, but without commitment at this stage on the actual figure of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentscontribution.
