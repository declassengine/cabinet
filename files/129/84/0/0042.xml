On 27th november the Jordan Governmenfs statement of policy to the House of Representativesincluded a statement of intention to end the Treaty and to get rid of Dritishbases.    On 29th November the Jordan prime Minister explained with. M. Ambassador that the Governments statement had been carefullydrafted to avoid reference to unilateral abrogation;   the Jordan Governmentwould soon be approaching Her Majesty&apos;s Government with a request for negotiations to terminate in an agreed manner.2. On 2lst December the Defence Committee invited me:-(a) to arrange for the Law Officers to be consulted on the legal aspects of terminating the Anglo-Jordan Treaty;(b) to arrange for the Iraq Government to be consulted again about the value from their point of view of continuing the present UnitedKingdom support for Jordan;(c) in the light of the above enquiries to considera further approach to the United States Govern-ment about the possibility of their taking over responsibility for support of the Jordanmilitary forces.3. The Law Officers have been consulted and their Opinion is being circulated separately (CP. (57) l).4. The Iraq Government are being consulted, but their views havenot yet been received.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government ^&quot;&apos; The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.jS ..
Extent of United Kingdom Obligations5. Our obligations under the Treaty are broadly as follows:-(a) in the event of Jordan becoming engaged in war,immediately to come to her aid as a measureof collective defence (Article I&apos;.t);(b) to afford financial assistance to enable Jordanto carry out the reciprocal obligation underArticle til (Exchange of Letters No. 5);(c) to reimburse Jordan for expenditure incurred on airfields, ports, roads and other meansand lines of communication and on accommoda-tion and maintenance of H . A.       units at Ammanand Mafraq airfields (Annex, paragraph 3, readwith Article l).(d) to provide British Service personnel on request(Annex, paragraph 6(iv)).The amount of our financial assistance is fixed annually by agree-ment with the Jordan Government.     Mo such agreement was made for thecurrent year owing to unsettled conditions resulting from the dismissal ofGlubb.     But hitherto we have paid monthly instalments at roughly the rateagreed for last year.Present Value of the Treaty6. The Chiefs of Staff have recently re-stated the United kingdom military requirements in Jordan as follows:-(a) the use of Mafraq airfield in support of the deterrent in peace-time and for bombing operations in global war;   and(b) the retention of overflying rights and stagingfacilities.None of these facilities is, 1 understand, considered vital.7. Politically, in the present state of the Middle East, the Treatyhas no possible further advantage except as a buttress to Nuri&apos;s positionin Iraq and thus to the Bagdad Fact.    But even Nuri may now regardJordan as hopeless.     Moreover the obligation to defend Jordan againstIsrael is a serious military liability.On the assumption therefore that the Iraq Covernment will not press us strongly to remain in Jordan, there is no compelling reason tomaintain the Treaty.     The main question now is how to disengage.How to Disengage8. The Opinion of the Law Officers makes it clear that we shouldnot be legally justified in abrogating the Treaty unilaterally and that theright course is to terminate it by agreement.    There are also other advantages in this course:-
(a) it is less likely to lead to chaos in Jordan with consequent danger of action by Israel and Arab-Israel hostilities;(b) it gives the Americans time to study thepossibility of taking our place;(c) it gives us some chance of being able to negotiatefor the satisfactory disposal of our fixedinstallations and to bring away stocks which Iunderstand to be worth some  6 millions.9. On the other hand we cannot afford to allow the Jordan Governmentto string us along, causing us the maximum embarrassment while claimingthe credit for throwing us out.     Still more important, we are stronglyadvised by K. M. Ambassador at Washington that the only way of getting the United States to take over financial responsibility for Jordan is to face the Administration with a clear statement of our intention to terminate the subsidy on a given date.10. In these circumstances the course which I recommend is to take up the Jordan Government on their desire to negotiate for the terminationof the Treaty, say that we agree the Treaty is no longer of any value and propose that it should be brought to an end in an agreed manner by the endof the United Kingdom financial year or by any earlier date which may beagreed upon.11. Meanwhile, the Jordan Arab Army Liaison Office have askedfor the January instalment of the subsidy to be paid on 1st January, or assoon after as possible.    The Foreign Office have been asked for  500,000and the War Office for  150,000.     It seems certain that the latter sum willin any event have to be scaled down to  100,000, thus leaving a totalinstalment for January of  600,000.    The last sentence of the Law Officers&apos;Opinion supoests a way of using the monthly instalment as a legitimatemeans of pressure on the Jordan Government.12. The following decisions are therefore required:-(a) whether we should make a communication tothe Jordan Government on the lines indicatedin paragraph 10 above;(b) whether we should delay the payment of the january instalment of the subsidy pending an approach to the Jordan Government;(c) whether we should face the United States with a clear indication of our intentions as in (a)and (b) of this paragraph.foreign Office, S. W. I.2nd January, 1957.
