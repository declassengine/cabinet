NORTHERN IRELAND:   TERRORIST ACTIVITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsEarly on the morning of Wednesday, 12th December, there was an outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland involving some ten incidentsaffecting nearly every county in the Province and causing damageestimated at  50,000.    On the morning of 13th December, a time bombwas found in the docks at Belfast alongside the R.N. V.R. GunneryTraining School.     Early on the morning of 14th December, two royal ulster Constabulary stations v/ere attacked by armed forces.2.      On 13th December the Home Secretary received a deputationof Members of the Ulster Unionist party at Westminster who made representations to him about these acts of terrorism.     He has also received a letter from the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,Lord Brookeborough, indicating his concern at these events and hisdisappointment that, despite the representations which he and hiscolleagues have from time to time made to the United Kingdom Govern-ment and the protests which have been made by the United KingdomGovernment to Dublin, no effective counter measures seem to have beentaken to prevent the organising of such acts of violence on the other side of the Border.3.      The representations which the Home Secretary received from northern Ireland Members of Parliament stress two main dangers inthe present situation.     First, there is the danger that Northern Irelandcitizens may feel compelled to indulge in serious reprisals whichmight lead to armed conflict and the loss of innocent lives on bothsides of the Border.     Secondly, there is the danger that these attacksmay gravely interfere with the efforts which the Northern ireland government have been making, with the assistance of the UnitedKingdom G overnmerit and the Development Council under Lord Chandos,to attract new industries to Northern Ireland.    The Home Secretary isbeing pressed to urge Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make a strong protest to the authorities in Dublin and to give the widest possiblepublicity to such a protest, in order to allay anxiety in Northern Ireland.4.      It will be remembered that, after the attack on the Rosslea PoliceStation on 26th November, 1955, Mr. Costello, the Prime Minister of theIrish Republic, on 30th November, 1955 made a statement in the Dailin which he strongly condemned terrorist activities.     This statement was endorsed by Mr. de valera.     In his statement, Mr. Costello said:-secret,P.(5 6) 284COPY NO17th December, 1956CABINET
ISO&quot;If my appeal to the members of the organisations concerned meets with no response, then the duty of theGovernment is clear.     We must assert and vindicate the peoples&apos; right to determine national policy and the right ofthe Parliament and the Government to maintain and upholdthe authority which reposes in them.    We are bound toensure that the unlawful activities of a military charactershall cease, and we are resolved to use, if necessary, allthe powers and forces at our disposal to bring such activities effectively to an end. &quot;5.      On 18th January, 1956, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy issued astatement condemning the use of unauthorised violence and declaring itto be &quot;a mortal sin for a Catholic to become or .remain a member of an organisation or society which arrogates to itself the right to bear armsand use them against its own, or another State&quot;.6.      These pronouncements, coupled with the imposition of silence onthe Press, caused the previously blatant Irish Republican Army todisappear from view.     The statements thus appeared to have had a good effect, and, indeed, may well have had some effect in weakening theorganisation, by damping public sympathy and possibly by causing some members to withdraw.    Northern Ireland, and Great Britain, were left in peace for a longer period than since the outbreak in June, 1954.    Itiis clear, however, that the hard core of the Irish Republican Army has remained in being and has been driven to reassert itself - whether fromdiscontent among its extreme members at the lack of activity, or fromfear of seeing the leadership of Irish Nationalist subversion pass torival bodies.7.      At the end of September there were reports of drilling by armedmen at a number of points on the Republican side of the Border.    TheNorthern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs came to see the HomeSecretary on 4th October and said that the Government of NorthernIreland were worried about, this development and about the lack of co-operation which they received from the R epublican police.    He suggestedthat pressure should be put on Dublin to improve matters.8.      Early on 11th November last, six Customs huts on the Ulster sideof the Border were blown up.     (Another hut was blown up on 9th December., )There was little evidence to show who was responsible for this damage,but it was thought that a Northern Ireland Nationalist gang might havebeen concerned, rather than the Irish Republican Army, particularly asthe latter organisation usually takes credit for its own work.Lord Jij rookeborough took the opportunity while in London on 2ist november last to represent to the Home Secretary the dangers of the tensesituation on the Border.    He had not., however, any very positivesuggestions as to what action the United Kingdom Government might take to improve the situation.9.      In the meantime, the Home Office had been in consultation withthe Commonwealth Relations Office who, in the absence of any clear evidence implicating the Republic in recent events and for reasonsaccepted as valid by the Home Office, were naturally reluctant to ask the Ambassador in Dublin to make further representations to the IrishGovernment.
10,      The Irish Republican Army&apos;s admission from their headquarters in Dublin of responsibility for the incidents of 12th December has put adifferent complexion on the situation.     There is still little clearindependent evidence that the Republic is involved in these latestincidents;   and in the past few years the Irish Republican Army have beencareful to limit their attacks to their declared objectives - the british forces.    But the scale and organising of the events of 12th Decemberboth smack of the Irish Republican Army, and their claims, and theirdisclaimers, are usually very reliable.     It is, therefore, sufficiently clear that this week&apos;s acts of terrorism will have been organised in,and presumably to some extent at leastj mounted from, the Republic,,with or without the support of dissidents from Northern Ireland.    Therewouldj therefore, seem to be a prima facie case for making representa-tions in Dublin.     We suggest that consideration might also be given to making a fresh approach to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with a viewto getting them to re-enforce their pronouncement of last January.11,     The Ulster Unionist Members foresaw that representations to the republican Government might, as in the past, not produce any very effective results, and it was suggested that in that event consideration should be given to applying economic pressure on the RepublicanGovern-ment, or even to the imposition of economic sanctions.    This is clearly a matter which would need very careful consideration before any action could be taken, and we do not suggest that any decision should be taken at present.12.     Lord Brookeborough has informed the Home Secretary that thismatter is going to be raised in the Northern Ireland House of commons on Tuesday, 18th December and that, in view of the acute feeling in ulster and the consequent pressure which there has been for somepositive statement about steps being taken by the authorities in London,we should let him know by the morning of 18th December what he can beauthorised to say in order to satisfy the people of Northern Ireland.13.    H. M. Ambassador at Dublin arranged on 13th December to see Mr. Cosgrave, Minister for External Affairs, as soon as possible witha view to eliciting whatever information was available from the Govern-ment of the Republic and to warn him of the serious view likely to betaken in London.    The interview took place this morning (when thefurther attacks on police barracks had occurred).    His report isattached (Commonwealth Relations Office telegram No. 3 9 from Dublin).14.     We recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should issue astrong protest to the Government of the Irish Republic and that the HcmeSecretary should be authorised to inform the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland that such a protest is being lodged.    Arrangements should bemade to lodge the protest simultaneously with the Prime ministers statement at Stormont.G,LL, -G.H.14th December, 1956.
