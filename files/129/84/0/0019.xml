(56) 26928th November, 1956CABINETUNITED KINGDOM FORCES IN GERMANYOur draft of a new political directive for the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) (Annex) has been under discussion in the North atlantic council for about a month.2. The discussion has recently not been going well from our point of view,largely because of events in Hungary. We are under pressure to accept a versionthat is watered down in certain important respects. But still more important, it hasbecome clear that even if our draft were adopted by the Council withoutamendment, the NATO military authorities would advise that it does not allow of any reduction in forces previously planned and that it would still be necessaryto maintain all the existing NATO forces plus the planned German contribution of twelve divisions and an air force of some 1,300 aircraft.3. A meeting of NATO Ministers is due to begin on 11th December. Wemust then try to secure agreement to a version of the political directive which comes as close as possible to our draft. We must also continue then and thereafter to endeavour to bring our allies round to our way of thinking. We still think thatglobal war is unlikely because of the appreciation by the Russians that theconsequences of thermo-nuclear attack, even after they have obtained parity withthe West, would be disastrous to them; and that in consequence the forcesmaintained by NATO should be the minimum needed for the purposes set outin paragraph 7 of our directive. It. is also clear that not only we but othercountries are going to find it impossible to support the burden of forces of thepresent size with a constantly growing expenditure on their equipment; and itis much better that the inevitable readjustment should be carried out in the lightof a proper appreciation of the politico-military situation and not as an unplannedscaling down in the face of economic necessity. Nevertheless, if we are to-obtain-early relief it must be through placing primary emphasis on our need for a levelof investment and reserves sufficient to sustain our economic position.4. This means that we must soon be prepared to disclose to our allies thelevel of forces which we think we shall be able to sustain.5. We are under obligation to consult with our allies about the level of all our forces in the NATO area and not only those in Germany. I am not yet in aposition to bring before my colleagues comprehensive proposals about our defence programme. In this paper I shall confine myself to those forces which are coveredby the Paris Agreements, namely, the Rhine Army and the 2nd Tactical Air Forcein Germany. As background, however, I should say that I think we shall haveto put to our allies proposals for reductions perhaps major reductions in fighter command, in the Royal Navy, and in the Canberra force in Bomber Command.Even for the V-Bomber force, though.there will be an increase as compared withits present strength, we shall be showing a decrease as compared with the strengthwe have previously told NATO that we were planning.50818
6. Our land forces in Germany consist at present of 4 Divisions (2 infantry and 2 Armoured) and the Brigade in Berlin. Their cost inDeutschmarks is about 56 millions a year. The 2nd Tactical Air Force consists at present of 466 aircraft and costs about  12 millions a year in Deutschmarks.7. Broadly speaking, in order to reduce the Deutschmark cost of these forces,one would need to make a rather more than proportionate reduction in their effective strength.8. We cannot argue that any reduction can be made without doing militarydamage; and we may take it that any reduction would be strongly deplored bythe NATO military authorities. We have never, of course, argued in connectionwith the political directive that NATO has more than enough military strength:our argument has always been that, faced as we are with having to balance one type of risk against another, there is justification in present circumstances for takingrather greater risks than hitherto on the military side in the interests of reducingthe politico-economic risks within NATO and the risks of all kinds outside it. Ifwe propose reductions we should not suggest that they will leave NATO forces aswell off as before. I should, however, mention that (a) It is the view of the War Office that if our reduction were limited to25 per cent, of present Deutschmark costs, we could maintain a corps of 2 Infantry Divisions and an Armoured Brigade Group (in additionto the Berlin Brigade) which, while naturally weakening our contribution, would make military sense in a way that a largerreduction would not.(b) The Canberra light bombers in the 2nd Tactical Air Force are beingequipped to carry atomic weapons, which increases the military capability of the force./ 9. The problem facing us can, I think, be summarised as follows. Howlarge a reduction should we propose to our allies in the interests of our economic position, bearing in mind that if we go too far we may provoke a general reductionin military contributions to NATO, and indeed endanger the very stability of the alliance, as v/ell as damaging the prospects of the closer relationship with europe which we have in mind in other fields? An important point to be borne in mindis that we are not in a position to take a unilateral decision: under the ParisAgreements we can only reduce our forces in Germany with the agreement of ourWestern European Union allies.10. I should be grateful for the views of my colleagues on the proposals weshould put to our allies about the size of our forces in Germany and about the date which we should propose for the completion of any reductions that are to bebrought about.11. It has been suggested that as/a preliminary to any discussion of forceproposals in NATO we should have private discussions with the Americans and later, if possible, with the French and the Germans. This seems to me sensible,bearing in mind that there are certain indications that the Americans would themselves like to make a fairly early reduction in their expenditure on forces onthe Continent.12. The matter is urgent, since we ought to have these discussions with the americans before the meeting fixed for 11th December. This could best bedone by arranging that the American party which will attend the Paris meeting should stop in London on the way for discussions with us. If we are to proposethis, instructions should be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washingtonwithout delay giving a general indication of the views which we propose to advance.A.

ANNEX&apos;; / .&quot;&quot;-UNITED KINGDOM DRAFT DIRECTIVE\&apos;\A review of NATO Defence Planning is required in order to determine how,within the resources likely to be available, the defence effort of the Alliance, and ofeach individual member, can best be adjusted to achieve the most effective pattern of forces in the light of current developments, notably:  (i) Development of thermo-nuclear weapons.(ii) The new Soviet tactics.(iii) The mounting costs of new weapons.2. It is evident that since the death of Stalin and the detonation of their ownthermo-nuclear bomb the Soviet Government have re-examined their tactics andstrategy. They now appreciate fully the disastrous consequences to Russia of athermo-nuclear attack, and they also appreciate that even after they have attainedparity with the West in bombs and means of delivery this will not affect our ability to devastate their country. Accordingly, unless there is a sudden and unexpectedreversal of Soviet policy or the Soviet Government make a disastrous miscalcula-tion, Russia will avoid global war. Since global war will not be initiated by NATOit must be regarded as unlikely.3. If, nevertheless, the Soviet Government do commit an identified act of aggression against NATO territory, it will be met: and NATO planning is atpresent based on the assumption that the West would at once launch a full-scale attack on Russia with thermo-nuclear weapons.4. Soviet long-term aims will, however, remain unchanged. In Europe, themain Soviet objective will continue to be disruption of the solidarity achieved in nato and WEU. At the same time Soviet attempts by both economic andpolitical means to subvert the independence of other nations and to undermine theposition of the West outside the NATO area, notably in the Middle East, South-East Asia and Africa, will be strongly increased.5. It must be assumed that Soviet efforts in the political and economic fieldswill be supplemented by indirect military action where this seems to them to be totheir advantage. This might take the form of action by the satellite or other hostilePowers, with Soviet moral or covert military support. We must also expect Soviet-inspired subversive movements either with or without covert military support, e.g.,by volunteers.6. In this new phase of competitive co-existence the members of the Alliancemust show flexibility in their thinking and their dispositions so as to put theiravailable resources to most effective use in meeting the Soviet threat in its variousand changing forms on a world front. The defence of the NATO area naturallyremains the primary task of NATO forces. Nevertheless, the NATO defence effort must be so adjusted so as to enable member countries to fulfil also their defence commitments in other areas : and despite the rising cost of weapons, overall defence expenditure must be kept at a level which will give the members of the Alliancethe necessary margin of economic strength to compete with the Soviet threat in all its aspects, without endangering their economic stability which in itself is anessential element of their security.7. Apart from forces for the strategic air offensive, the land, sea and airforces maintained by NATO should be the minimum needed to meet the followingrequirements in the NATO area:  (i) To keep confidence in the military effectiveness of the NATO defence organisation and thereby to contribute to the deterrent to aggression,and to prevent external intimidation.(ii) To deal with local infiltrations and incursions.(iii) To enable Soviet or Satellite aggressive intentions at: sea, on land, orin the air to be identified as such; to provide a shield against a satelliteattack; and to hold an identified Soviet aggression until the strategiccounter-offensive becomes effective.(iv) To secure the radar facilities required for the full use of the strategicbomber forces.
8. NATO land, sea and air forces will be provided with an atomic capability(over and above that possessed by the strategic air forces) available for use in theevent of aggression whether by Russia or her satellites should the situation sorequire.9. The NATO military authorities should reassess the size, composition anddisposition of NATO forces in accordance with the above political direction.
