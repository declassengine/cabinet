THE ECONOMIC situation note by the Prime MinisterWe shall shortly be discussing the memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the State of the Economy (C. P. (57) 4), but I wouldlike to comment now on the first sentence of it.?.. I do not think that the events of Suez can be reckoned as a tacticaldefeat.     It is much too early to pronounce on an operation of this kind.3.      This much is certain:The Soviet Egyptian air force has been destroyed.The Israelis have eliminated one-third of the egyptian army and its equipment.Jordan and Syria have been kept from active aiign-ment with Nasser, whose personal position has not(according to our reports) been strengthened.The extent of Soviet penetration into the middle east has been exposed, with the result that theUnited States at last seems to be taking the action forwhich we pleaded in vain throughout 1956.     It may bethat the United States attitude to us in the middle east dates from our refusal to give up Buraimi.But even so we would rather have them in the middle east than the Russians.The United Nations has been given a chance totake effective action, if it is capable of it.4.      As against these things it must be admitted that we and the french have been compelled, by a combination of the United States and the soviet union, acting inside and outside the United Nations, to withdraw fromPort Said before we could ensure the clearance of the Canal.     This hascertainly done us great damage, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is right to invite us to consider how to repair it.A.E.10, Downing Street, S. w. 1.5th January, 1957.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited-It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No. So ...CP.(57) 87th January, 1957CABINET
