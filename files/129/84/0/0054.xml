(T lia^DCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-----______-_______-----------------.....------.------------______ftSECRETC.P.(57) 14 COPY NO. fa \9th January, 1957CABINETLIBYAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsBACKGROUNDA United States Delegation will be in London on 15th January -16th January, 1957 to hold talks at the official level about policy towardsLibya.   The idea of these talks goes back several months but they will now be held at a time when Her Majesty&quot;s Government are urgentlyreviewing their overseas commitments particularly in the Middle East.The talks are also particularly opportune in view of the LibyanGovernments recent intimation that they desire a revision of the Anglo-Libyan Treaty of 1953.UNITED KINGDOM OBLIGATIONS2.       The Treaty between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Libya signed in 1953 is for twenty years.   Its principal provisions are as follows -Article 1There shall be peace and friendship and a close alliance between the High Contracting Parties in consecration of theircordial understanding and their good relations.Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not toadopt in regard to foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or which might create difficulties forthe other party thereto.Article should either High Contracting Party become engaged in war or armed conflict, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of Article 4, immediately come to his aidas a measure of collective defence.   In the event of an imminentmenace of hostilities involving either of the High ContractingParties they will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence.Article 3The High Contracting Parties recognise that it is in their common interest to provide for their mutual defence and toensure that their countries are in a position to play their part in-1-
the maintenance of international peace and security.   To thisend each will furnish to the other all the facilities and assistancein his power on terms to be agreed upon.   In return for facilities provided by His Majesty The King of Libya for Britisharmed forces in Libya on conditions to be agreed upon, HerBritannic Majesty will provide financial assistance to HisMajesty The King of Libya, on terms to be agreed upon asaforesaid.Article 4Nothing in the present Treaty is intended to, or shall inany way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or maydevolve, upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the charter of the United Nations or under any other existing inter-national agreements, conventions or treaties, including, in thecase of Libya, the Covenant of the League of Arab States.3.       Under a separate Military Agreement pursuant to Article 3 ofthe Treaty Her Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to help thedevelopment of the Libyan Army and enjoy the right to station UnitedKingdom troops in Libya.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government maintain aMilitary Mission to the Libyan Army at a cost of  33,000 per annum but no final decisions have been reached as regards the details of theexpansion of the Libyan Army.   In an agreed minute drawn up at theconclusion of conversations with the Libyan Prime Minister in London inJune 1 956,however,Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to give assistance towards the expansion of the Libyan Army and subject to technicalexamination by both States to help with the provision of equipment andtraining facilities and the use of British installations in Libya.   her majesty&apos;s Government took note of the Libyan Government1 s desire toform a Navy and an Air Force and both Governments agreed that expertsfrom the two countries should meet at the earliest possible moment toexamine Libya&apos;s requirements.   It was understood, according to the agreed minute, that these examinations should cover both financial andmilitary aspects.   For a number of reasons the joint expert examinationhas not yet taken place.   But we came pretty close last June to a promise to expand the Libyan Army to 5,000 and to provide a very modest embryoNavy.4.       Under a Financial Agreement of the same date as the Treaty her majesty&apos;s Government undertook to provide annual financial assistance&quot;to assist Libya to enjoy conditions of financial stability and orderlyeconomic development&quot;.The annual assistance for the first five years was to be 2.75 millions as a subvention to the budget and  1 million for development.   In fact, our budgetary subvention for 1956/7 was  3 millions and for 1957/8 it will be  3.25 millions or possibly  3.5 millions.The annual rate for the second five-year period, starting on1st April, 1958, is governed by the following sentence from the financial agreement -&quot;The United Kingdom will, taking into account the needs of libya in consultation with the Government of Libya, undertaketo give such suitable assistance annually during the followingperiod of five years as may be agreed between the twoGovernments. &quot;A fuller statement of our present financial obligations to Libya is attached as Annex A.
mUNITED KINGDOM INTERESTS IN LIBYA5.       The main interests of Her Majesty&apos;s Government are as follows -(a) To check Egyptian influence and to keep Libya within theWestern orbitThe -&quot;Libyan Government is well aware that its interests are threatened by Egyptian ambitions and that Libya will find security fromEgyptian and Communist attempts only through association with the West.Libya has recently taken the initiative in talking to Tunisia about aNorth African grouping, which might later extend to certain countries inthe Middle East, and which would be anti-Communist and mildly pro-Western.   There will, of course, continue to be strong pro-Egyptianelements in Libya, and we cannot expect to develop an active anti-Egyptian attitude there.   Libya will be able to maintain a pro-Westernattitude only if we and the Americans continue to assist her economy and, inthe face of tempting offers from the Russians and Egyptians, help her tobuild up her armed forces.(b) To maintain the influence of King Idris and strengtheninternal securityOur support of the Senussi of whom the King is the leader isremembered and still valued by the Libyans.   The King is the strongestpro-Western and specifically pro-British force in the country.   It is to our interest that his authority should be upheld and strengthened.   recent experience shows the impossibility of using our land forces in Libyain hostilities against another Arab State.    We should therefore nowthink in terms of greatly reduced forces stationed in Cyrenaica alonewhose main role would be to sustain the confidence of the King, protecthim in the event of trouble and to act as a trip-wire against Egyptianaggression.(c) To secure specific military facilitiesApart from any land forces which we may wish to keep for thepurposes outlined in (b) above the R.A.F. wish to retain air stagingrights at El Adem and Idris. It must be recognised however that such rights are not likely to remain available for the purpose of action against another Arab State including the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms and that in anycase they are liable to be frustrated so long as Egypt, Jordan and Syriaare in a position to object to overflying.   The cost of these facilities ascompared with our present expenditure on Army and R.A.F. account isgiven in Annex B.LIBYAN REQUIREMENTS6.       In addition to the requests for the expansion of the Libyan armed forces put foward   in the conversations in June 1956, details of which canbe found in Annex C, the Libyan Prime Minister has told H.M. ambassador at Tripoli that he has in mind the following revisions in the Treaty -(a) the insertion of a clause binding the United Kingdom not touse bases in Libya either for attack on any Arab State or in conflict with the Charter of the United Nations;(b) the removal of British troops from the big towns;
(c)  a definite provision for the phased expansion of the LibyanArmy, the British Forces in Libya to be reduced as the libyan Army grew (telegram from Tripoli to theForeign Office No. 482 of 22nd November, 1956),POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION7. There are two possible ways of reconciling United Kingdom andLibyan requirements:-(a) we might reduce our land forces as indicated in para-graph 5(b) above and apply the resulting economiesto building up the Libyan armed forces to the leveldesired by the Libyan Government.   This would doubt-less be welcome to the Libyan Government.     But weare under no obligation to carry sympathy to theselengths;(b) we might reduce our land forces as already suggestedbut limit our expenditure on building up the Libyanarmed forces to a definite figure and try to induce theUnited States to pay whatever was necessary over and above this figure.    This course should help to convince the United States Administration of our determination to cut our overseas expenditure to the minimum, though they may plead constitutional difficulties in an attemptto resist these new commitments.BASIS OF SHARING WITH THE UNITED STATES8.      Assuming that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment prefer course (b) we might seek United States agreement to a division of responsibility on the follow-ing basis.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government would remain responsible for:-(i)   Financial assistance to the Libyans for each of the fiveyears following 1958 equivalent to some 25 per cent ofour present financial assistance which amounts to 4 millions a year.Note:    In other cases (notably Malaya and Ghana) we havestated that it is Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy notto make development aid available to independent members of the Commonwealth, even in return for defence facilities.     Therefore, although we should hopethat our contributions to the Libyan economy would infact be for development and not as a budgetarysubvention, it might be better to describe it in thesemore general terms.(ii)   The cost of the capital equipment required for theexpansion of the Libyan army to 5,000 men on theunderstanding that of this number at least 1,000 willbe the responsibility of the United States as already promised, and the provision of a few coastal vesselsmainly against smuggling and illicit sponge-fishing;
(iii)  the maintenance of our Military Mission.The United States would in effect be asked to take over the Libyan budgetdeficit including the cost of maintaining the Libyan Army (and Navy ifany).    If they insist that their constitution does not allow them to make adirect budgetary subvention we should be prepared to examine with them the possibility of reshaping the Libyan Budget so that some items could bedealt with separately.    At the same time we should tell the UnitedStates firmly that we are unable to contribute to the establishment or the subsequent maintenance of a Libyan nucleus Air Force.    As regards our military facilities in Libya we should say that we intend to reduce our land forces to the extent indicated in paragraph 5(b) above, while retainingour air staging rights.9.      The United States may well dispute this division of responsibilities.They may suggest that we ought to devote some of the economies resultingfrom the reduction of our land forces to support the Libyan armed forces or the Libyan Budget more generously than at present;   we might recoupourselves to some extent by cutting our contribution to development.     Wemust resist committing ourselves to the Americans on the precise alloca-tion of our contribution as between development and the budgetarysubvention.    There is no valid reason why the United States should not take on the Budget subvention and on the other hand our support for development brings us useful political credit.     Our only line of compromise therefore is to agree if necessary to continue some of ourBudget subvention after 1958.10.     It might be mentioned that, should the United States Governmenttake over a substantial proportion of our present commitments to Libya,we should nevertheless hope that they would encourage the Libyans to stay in the sterling area:  though there is little likelihood that they would want to leave.R EC ommend at ION11. I invite my colleagues to agree that our Delegation to theforthcoming talks with the United States should proceed on the basis of paragraphs 8 and 9 of this memorandum.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.9th January, 1957.
Our obligations to provide financial assistance arise out ofArticle 3 of the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with Libya of29th July, 1953 (Cmd. 8914) q.v.    The operative sentence is:-&quot;In return for facilities provided by His Majesty TheKing of Libya for British armed forces in Libya on conditions to be agreed upon, Her Britannic Majesty will providefinancial assistance to His Majesty The King of Libya on terms to be agreed upon as foresaid. &quot;The Financial Agreement with Libya of the same date provided thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government should provide annual financial assistance&quot;to assist Libya to enjoy conditions of financial stability and orderlyeconomic development&quot;.2.      Annual assistance for the first quinquennium was to be 2.75 millions towards the budg;et and  1 million for development.     InJune, 1956, it was agreed to increase the former by  0.25 million in1956/57, and  0. 5 million (with the possibility of up to a further 0.25 million) in 1957/58, since, on Libyan estimates, they would havebudget deficits in these two years of  0.47 million and  1.39 millionsrespectively.3.      The annual rate for the next five-year period starting on1st April, 1958 is governed by the wording of Article 3 of the financial agreement as follows:-&quot;. . . the United Kingdom Government will, taking intoaccount the needs of Libya in consultation with the Governmentof Libya, undertake to give such suitable assistance annuallyduring the following period of five years as may be agreed between the two Governments. &quot;4.      The Libyans will doubtless argue that the new annual rate should cover the whole of their ever-increasing budget deficits as well as inciuda contribution to development.     (A forecast for 1958/59 made last Juneprojected a total deficit on the budget of nearly  5 millions. )    However,there is no provision in either Agreement that the United kingdom contribution should specifically balance the Budget (in 1952/53, 1953/54and 1955/56, for instance, the Libyans were left with quite sizeablesurpluses, whereas in 1956/57 and 1957/58, even with the extra assistantdescribed in paragraph 2 above, they are bearing estimated residualdeficits) and the size of any future payments seems to be a matter for negotiation within the terms of the two Agreements.     It does not follow that we are obliged to make a contribution to development as well as tothe budget in future.5. As Article 3 of the Treaty is the crux of our financial assistance,diminishing facilities means diminishing financial assistance.A STATEMENT OF OUR PRESENT FINANCIAL obligations to LIBYA (BOTH BUDGET DEFICIT AND DEVELOPMENT)

IllANNEX B(II)the amount being seem1 by us this year in libya&quot;on our works programme^tj our plans for the nsxt few years for the Army, the main task is the re-provision of barrack accommodationso that our troops can get away from the two capitals.For the Air Force, the principal task is the development of El Ademairfield, the staging facilities at which continue to be necessary.Expenditure on Army works in Libya accounted for  -1 .7 millions in the1956/57 Estimates. Expenditure on Air Force works in Libya accounted for 225,000 in the 1956/57   Estimates.Expenditure in future years for the re-provision of barrackaccommodation for the Army and other Army works servioes in Libya, on theassumption that the present forces are retained, would amount to 1,5 millions in 1957/58 and thereafter would rise to about  2 millions a year up to and including 1961/62.Expenditure in future years to the E.A.F. in Libya increases sharplyby reason of planned capital expenditure on the development of El Adem.Maintenance remains constant at  100,800 a year.   The totals, includingthe capital expenditure on El Adem are -1957/58  929, om1958/59  1,04^,000(III)FORECAST OF THE SAVINGS TP OUR military PLANS WERETO BE mi^ticaihlyjormtaiierj(DOES THIS INVOLVE A NEW LOOKBY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF?!(i) If the forces in Libya were reduced to the R.A.F. personnelrequired at the two Staging Posts and the Ministry of Supply TropicalExperimental Unit, there would be a. saving of about  7.75 millions if theArmy forces concerned were withdrawn and disbanded (including  4 millions in local currency).(ii) If, however, the existing Army Units in Libya were withdrawn anddisbanded and, in their plaee, two battalions were put in to act as a trip-wire against Egyptian aggression etc., the cost would be about 2.5 millions, of which about half would be local costs.(iii) The figures in (i) and (ii) are figures for a full year after theremoval and disbandment had been completed.   The savings in 1957/58 and1 958/59 would be much smaller.(iv) These figures do not take account of capital works.   If UnitedKingdom land forces were wholly removed from Libya, the capital expenditureof about  8.5 millions referred to in (ii) of this Annex would be saved.If the forces consisted of two battalions, rather more than half would be saved.(v) It should not be assumed that these savings would necessarily be additional to those which will result from the Policy Review Committee^decision to reduce the Army to 200,600 men.-2-
ANNEX 0ESTIMATES OF THE COST OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS OJ^ MEETING&apos;THE LIBYAN REQUESTS FOR THE EXPANSION OF THEIR armed forces. WITH SEPARATE FIGURES FOR EACH service * What the Libyans YirantThe Libyan Prime Minister told us last June that what he wantedwas an army of about 20,COO men on the Arab Legion model, plus an airforce of modern aircraft, beginning with, say, a squadron, plus a smallnavy.   The recurrent costs of forces of this size alone might come to 15 millions:   we have no idea of what the capital costs would amount to.The Libyan Army&apos;s present size is about 1,759 men which they are hoping to expend to about 2,500 next year (the Americans are supplying the equipment):they have no navy or air force.2. Our obligations under the Agreed Minute of 29th June, 1 956We agreed to &quot;give assistance towards the expansion of the LibyanArmy and, subject to technical examination by both sides to help over theprovision of equipment and training facilities and the use of Britishinstallations in Libya.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the LibyanGovernments desire to form a Navy and an Air Force and both Governmentsagreed that experts from the two countries should meet at the earliestpossible moment to examine Libya&apos;s requirements.   It is understood thatthese examinations should cover both financial and military aspects.&quot;3. What we think might be a realistic programme of expansion overthe next five yearsAn Inter-departmental Working Party has made tentative estimatesalong the following lines -(a) Army.   The cost of bringing the Libyan Army to a strength ofabout 5.600 men by 1 961 , organised on suitable internal security lines,is impossible to estimate at all accurately.   The cost of equipment forthe ne\T units might be about  1.25 millions j the recurrent costs of theforce (assuming a similar capitation rate as for the Jordan Arab Legion)might be about  2.25- 2.5 millions a year.   However, we have no idea of thecost of, for instance, the new schools of instruction that would be necessary or of works services.0-0 ^djh-lbrcg&apos;   &quot;he cost of a small piston-engined air force(6 C]iipmurdcs&quot;^nd^Balliols) spares and initial training might amount to 169,OOt.   we have no idea of the recurrent costs of such an air force,beyond the fact that maintenance (annual operating cost) of aircraft mightbe about  5i,0S0 a year.(c) Navy.   No figures were considered and it was hoped to he ablenot to pursue this side.    (Estimates given by the Admiralty in June 1956of the cost of a small navy consisting of minesweepers, boom defencevessels, and patrol craft were:    11.25 millions construction and 1.3 millions running costs.   These presumably do not include the cost of pay, etc. for the men in the Navy or of training.)(d) British Service Mission.   Any help by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin training Libyans or in the actual work of the expansion would presumablyadd to the costs of the British Military Mission in Libya or require newNaval or Mr Force Missions there.The tentative views of the Working Party were that it would be best to dissuade the Libyans from the idea of building up an Air Force to*     go as slowly as possible with the formation of a navy, and to confine ourhelp aver the army, in the first instance, to the training school forLibyan officers which is the first priority.   No figures have been mentioned to the Libyans.
4* Where we go from here the only discussion with the Libyans since the negotiations last june has been on the lines of &apos;X&apos; above.   We do not know whether theywould be prepared to consider something on the lines considered by theWorking Party in paragraph 3(a) to (d) above.   The general conclusioncan only he a wide range of financial cost.   Thus we start from what wehave   considered would be a realistic expansion of the nexb five years which can be summarised as Capital cost (approx.)  1.5 millions andRecurrent cost of  2,5 millions (.approx.) - this ignores anything for theNavy - with the other end of the range as the Libyan original request of 15 millions recurrent cost and an unknown capital cost.   Works services are not included in the figure given for capital cost, and this could hesizeable.   The lower end of the range, in table form, is as follows -Capital cost Recurrent cost  millions   millions.     Army.   (5,009) 1,25 2.45 (approx.)Air Force .17 .95Navy^MlNil 1.42 (say 1 .5 m.)22.other permutations within the range are possible, but they would be guesses.
