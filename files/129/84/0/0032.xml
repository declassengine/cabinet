0    140Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1956CONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 28214th December, 1956CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductoryThe Government are committed to a comprehensive review of localgovernment finance. It has been in active progress for eighteen months: andlocal authorities, the general public and Parliament expect to see worthwhile results.We are also committed to an announcement of our general conclusions beforethe end of the year.2. This review has been handled by a Sub-Committee of the Home AffairsCommittee under my Chairmanship; and we have had the benefit of five reports from officials. In this paper, following the discussions in the Sub-Committee, put forward, with the agreement of the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, the main proposals for changes. In brief, they provide for re-rating of industry and freight-transport the initial stage in this parliament being re-rating to 50 per cent, of net annual value (instead of thepresent 25 per cent.) coupled with a reduction of grants to local authorities;substitution of a general grant on a new basis for as many as possible of the present individual grants.We should consider these proposals in the light of what we said in our election Manifesto: &quot; The problems of local government finance will receive oururgent attention. They must be considered afresh in the light of present-dayconditions.&quot; We promised reforms &quot; to continue to attract to local governmentthe ablest men and women, and to ensure that services closely touching the dailylives of everyone are not subjected to impersonal control from aloft and afar.&quot;The Basis of Local Finance3. The general picture of local government finance is of rapidly expandingexpenditure and a drift towards dependence on Government grants. In1955-56 the share of the Exchequer in local government expenditure on revenue account in England and Wales was  504 millions, while the rates contributed only 420 millions. By 1961-62, if nothing is done, present policies (at present prices)will increase the rate-borne share by another  130 millions and the Exchequer^share by no less than  195 millions. Local government expenditure as a whole will have risen by some 30 per cent.4. The yield of rates has been expanding more slowly than incomes or taxes.Since before World War II rates collected per head have doubled; but personal incomes (net of income tax and surtax) have, on average, nearly trebled; and the yield of indirect taxes has increased five times and of direct taxes six times.5. These are significant indicators of the malaise in local government. too little of what is spent is found from local resources; and there is a degree of interference and control from the centre which saps local initiative. The attractionof service on the local Council is markedly diminished. We shall not achieve the declared objective of a sound local government without radical reform. Itis not necessary to abandon rates in favour of some new source of income, suchas a local income tax or entertainments duty, which bristle with difficulties. rates are a well-established source of taxation; and provided that the basis ofassessments is made equitable as between the various classes of ratepayers, theyare as sound a source as we can hope to find for local finance. They are notover-loaded arrears and losses are much lower than before the war.Copy No. 5850932e
6. It must therefore be an essential feature of our announced conclusions on this review that the Government intend to make the basis of rating moreequitable, by the various steps detailed below.. Measures to Correct the Rating System7. Three immediate steps need to be taken so as to operate from April1957-(a) a relief of one-fifth of the rates on shops, commercial properties of allkinds and other properties assessed to a gross value (other than houses) for theperiod until 1961 of the current Valuation Lists; (b) a revision of the level ofpayments by the State-owned gas, electricity and transport industries; and (c) onechange in the basis of equalisation grants. These involve early legislation and arebeing dealt with separately. All I need say about them here is that the first is a necessary measure of temporary relief in common fairness since the recentrevaluation has meant a shift of burden from householders to other ratepayers.The second immediate measure is to correct a technical fault which would otherwiseaccidentally let these industries off part of their payments as a result of the ratingrevaluation of 1956. The third corrects an inequity particularly affectingCambridgeshire and two Welsh Counties as a consequence of the revaluation ofthe Universities on a new basis.Re-rating8. Looking beyond these immediate measures the rating system will still be inequitable so long as there is derating. As an initial measure it is suggested thatthe present derating of industry and freight-transport be withdrawn in part by1958 or 1959 so that from then they pay rates on half their net annual value insteadof one-quarter. This is but a first step to full re-rating in due course. Theproposal at the first stage does not extend at all to agriculture; but in the later stage it may be desirable to explore a suggestion made by the Minister ofAgriculture that he would not object to the rating of agricultural buildings, as distinct from land, if a satisfactory system could be worked out. (The farmer&apos;sdwelling house is already rated.) It is not suggested that the payments of theState-owned transport system should be increased beyond the immediate correctionmentioned in the preceding paragraph. It will be desirable to accompany this -rating by a review of the Regulations which govern the rateability of plant and machinery. The Treasury have accepted the proposals for re-rating on theunderstanding that there will be grant reductions to offset the proceeds. Thequestion of such reductions is dealt with in paragraph 10 below.The Rate Liabilities of Householders9. To complete the picture of measures necessary in the field of rating I now come to householders, who constitute the biggest single group of ratepayers. Atpresent, as a result of legislation introduced by the Labour Government andamended in detail but not in principle by us, houses are assessed on their 1939rental values while everything else is upon current values. This has entailed aconsiderable shift of burden: before the revaluation of this year houses carriednearly 60 per cent, of the total rate burden but now their share is down to under50 per cent. It is this which has particularly incensed shopkeepers. The aim mustbe to assess all rateable properties on current and comparable values; and as thingsstand this will be done in the 1961 revaluation. But the transition will need great care if the jolt is not to be excessive. It is also the clear corollary of this situation that we should not before 1961 do anything which softens the householders stillfurther. The Sub-Committee have had before them various suggestions for dealingwith the situation of 1961, and it is clear that in one way or another it can bekept under control. It would, however, be unwise to formulate decisions on themethod until much nearer 1961 when the actual rise in house rents following ourrent legislation can be assessed. This is why a consequential grant adjustment forthe final stage of full re-rating of industry and freight transport (to which I referbelow), a possible measure of rating of agriculture at the same time, and themeans for bringing houses back on to current values, are all at this stage left alittle indefinite. These further changes would not be during the life of the present parliament.Reform in the Field of Grants10. A 50 per cent, re-rating of industry and freight transport in 1958 or 1959would provide local authorities with an extra  25 millions of rates.  Having regard
to the excessive level which grants have reached, it is undesirable that much ofthis money should be left with the local authorities. It would be one more relief to householders and others. Officials therefore prepared proposals for cuts ingrants, distributing these cuts in amounts which would do least harm and indeedshould be valuable in themselves in abating the tendencies to extravagance inherent in high-percentage grants. The Sub-Committee have since considered whether thefull rigour of this cut should be enforced. Of the  25 millions, some  5 millionscould be surrendered to local authorities with least harm; and the Sub-Committeefavour some concession of this kind, but the position of the Chancellor was reserved.11. The question whether in the final stage of industrial re-rating, &amp;c, we make a further cut in grants must be left with the other issues of that time for laterdecision.The Proposal for a General Grant12. Of equal importance is a proposal which has developed out of thediscussions of the Sub-Committee for a general grant which would replace as manyof the specific grants as practicable. The total of this grant would be fixed inadvance by the Government for a period of two or three years (possibly for longerperiods later on), though not necessarily at the same figure for each year in theperiod. The predetermined sum would then be distributed to local authorities by reference to prescribed factors of weighted population which are readilyascertainable but cannot be directly influenced by the local authority, and whichafford a fair and reasonable measure of the relative needs of each authority. (Theformula governing the distribution of the grant would have to be fully discussed with the local authorities.) Being predetermined and related to these tests of needrather than to willingness or capacity to spend, such a general grant would facilitateorderly development of services of a broadly uniform standard within the limits of the resources which can be made available. For the individual local authority the difference would be that they would have to decide the distribution betweenservices not merely of some  500 millions of rates plus  75 millions of ExchequerEqualisation Grant but also of some  280 millions of grant not tied to particular services; and they would have every incentive to spend this money wisely.Specific grants would be reduced to about  225 millions.13. It would be a corollary that new specific grants should not henceforth be started except for overwhelming reason. If the service sought to be grant-aidedis nation-wide, the proper course would be to adjust the total of the general grant(and, if necessary, also the formula for distribution) at the next review of that grant.14. At the outset the general grant would be designed to distribute a total sum equal to that then being paid out through the nine specific grants which itwould replace. The formula has been designed with an eye to the need not to depart too far from the present basis of distribution but inevitably some areaslose while others gain. The results are analysed in the Appendix. A special self-financing scheme would ease the transition.15.   The services which would be covered by the general grant are:  Education (but not school milk, school meals or advanced technology).Health Services.Fire.Child Care.Town Planning (but not blitz redevelopment).Road Safety.Traffic Patrols.. Registration of Electors.Physical Training and Recreation.16. Grants for other services are not, for one reason or another, suitable for inclusion in the general grant.17 The general grant would total  279 millions on the figures of 1956-57(probably nearer  300 millions in 1958 or 1959 when they could be introduced).With figures of this order, and a further  73 millions for equalisation grants,60 per cent, of all grant assistance would be freed from detailed control.50932 B 2
18. Departments, with rare exceptions, fear that if a specific grant w\reabolished that service would not be so adequately provided, and that their prospects of securing improvements would be diminished. The interest of the Minister ofEducation is much the largest; and he is concerned whether the necessary increased output of scientists and engineers would with a general grant be secured.19. In fact, the Central Governmenfs influence over local services rests partly on local authorities being willing to respond to the Governmenfs exhortations solong as the Government will bear a share of the cost, and partly on statutory powers to direct unwilling local authorities in the last resort. In education abovethe compulsory school age, no government, central or local, can do more thanprovide buildings, teachers and other facilities, and exhort the public to use them.If too few young people come forward the Governmenfs objective in the field of technical education will not in any case be attained; but reluctance on the part oflocal authorities need by no obstacle to its attainment because, if local authoritiesdo not provide sufficient facilities, the Minister has statutory power to make themdo so. It can be argued that the Minister must be able to rely on the specific grantas a reinforcement to the exercise of his statutory powers. The argument on theother side is that the price paid for this reinforcement is too high, i.e., the atrophyof local government and its degeneration into little more than an agent of theCentral Government.20. The pros and cons of the general grant were summarised for us by officials as follows.Disadvantages of a General Grant21. (a) The special interests will not like it. They are vocal and they aretrained to apply pressure at the centre.(b) Education carries the lion&apos;s share  241 millions out of  279 millions.It is not a convenient moment because the service is not static. Nor are the other services.(c) Some areas will eventually lose appreciably. Others will correspondinglygain but will be little help in dealing with the losers. A transitional scheme avoidstrouble at the political danger point in time but it can only postpone and spread the changes, perhaps with some Exchequer assistance.(d) It entails for the services in the pool establishing key points of control toensure essential standards.(e) It entails a decision on the amount of the grant every two or three years.Advantages of General Grant22.-(a) Against the vocal special interests, there is a solid core of opinion which deplores the pull-devil-pull-baker of specific grants, and wants the localauthority responsive to its electorate and master in its own house. A general grant of nearly  300 millions (with a further  73 millions of equalisation grant)would give local authorities a real measure of freedom without freeing them from central control on essential matters.(b) Against the fact that it is not a convenient moment in any of the services concerned because they are not static, there is the further fact that they probablynever will be or should be. It is at least not the worst moment for the change, andthe review offers the only opportunity.(c) The capacity of pressure groups to work upon the centre would be weakened. Their attention would tend to shift to the local authorities, at a timewhen Ministers may have to restrain the rate of development and incur the criticism of necessary halts and checks in the development of the services.(d) There should be a marked administrative saving, central and local; anda reduction of friction inevitable with detailed control.(e) It puts an end to the bribe of ninepence-for-fourpence inherent inpercentage grants and the never-ending expansionism regardless of circumstances which that entails. Instead, it offers the prospect of controlled and orderlydevelopment according to the means available, encourages economy and efficiency,and puts the financial responsibility for marginal expenditure on the ratepayers.(/) A general grant and substantial reduction of other grants coupled withre-rating are the only two courses which offer a worthwhile result of the much-advertised review and which could give the necessary financial fillip to there organisation of local government.
The Suggested Analogy with the Agricultural Price Reviews23. It has been said in the Sub-Committee that a general grant would importin to local government the atmosphere of the agricultural price review. That istrue in one sense; but there would be significant differences. The annual;agricultural price reviews affect the very living of a powerful section of thecommunity. They are in consequence strident. In the reviews of the general grant every two or three years the issue would be the extent to which the services concerned should in the forthcoming period be expanded. This is a more urbaneissue. The Government would face, not a monolithic and powerful special interest,but a number of special interests concerned with the furtherance of education,child welfare, fire prevention, &amp;c, which have been put in competition with one another; and with the local authority associations (as the leaders of the other side),cool to all these special interests.The Fundamental Questions24. From the constitutional point of view, the fundamental issue is how fara Conservative Government should try to make local government more democraticand self-reliant and how far they should allow local authorities to become increasingly mere agents for the execution of social and educational policynationally conceived and directed. If my colleagues are prepared to back thescheme, they must be prepared for sharp controversy. The periodical reviews ofthe amount of the general grant will involve major decisions by the Governmentwhich may revive argument, but the Central Government will have consciouscontrol of the amount made available and local authorities will have a strengthenedincentive to use it economically and wisely.25. From the financial point of view the overriding issue may well prove tobe how to keep down local government expenditure. As indicated in paragraph 3,on present prices and with present policies and grant systems, an increase of 400 millions in local expenditure is to be expected by 1961-62. In this climate itmay be impossible to continue the present percentage grants unchanged.Percentage grants are an invitation to expenditure; and the higher the percentage,the greater the incitement. The alternatives would then be the general grant orspecific grants drastically revised. The latter would leave with departmental ministers the odium of the necessary halts and checks to the development of their services. It would do nothing to secure the promised improvement of localgovernment.Other Changes in Grants26.   Other desirable changes in the grant system I can deal with more briefly.Equalisation Grants27. Suggestions for improving the equalisation grants are ready-made for usin the report of a Committee of 1953, which can be brought up to date on details.Highway Grants28. Some review of the highway grants seems desirable to meet the complaints of the local authorities. A revision now will fit in with other changes and facilitate the highway programme.Timing29. Reforms of this importance ought not to run the risk of hazards preventingtheir implementation in the later sessions of Parliament. They could not possibly be ready for legislation before next Easter; but if it were at all possible to introduce a Bill then they could operate from April 1958. Failing that, a sure place should,I suggest, be found in the legislation of the following session. They could thenoperate from April 1959. Transitional arrangements would ensure that the changeshad not affected rates when the end of this Parliament entailed an appeal to thecountry.
Summary of the Issues for Decision30. We are committed to announcing our general conclusions on the followingissues by the end of the year, and must take into account what we said in our election Manifesto:  (a) The re-rating of industry and freight-transport to 50 per cent, (but no increase on this score in the level of Pool payments by the british transport Commission) accompanied by a net reduction in grants ofsome  20 millions.(b) Introduction of a general grant in place of the specific grants listed above.(c) Review of the equalisation grants and the highway grants.31. The announcement of the results of the review would indicate theintention to legislate on the above lines as soon as practicable and would add thatthese measures, and the measures for the temporary relief of commercial premises and the adjustment of the level of Pool payments, are all designed as part of a widerplan with the twin objectives of increasing local financial responsibility and of bringing back all rated premises by acceptable degrees to the basis of full ratingon current values. (Agriculture is not at present rated at all; and if we are pressedas to our intentions in that field we should not, I suggest, say more than that theposition of agriculture will be further considered at a later stage.)32. We have to consider the merits of these propositions individually andalso the question whether, without a general grant, the programme would be adequate either politically or financially. There can be no doubt about the effectiveness of the package if we add to the other propositions that for a general grant. On the other hand, a package including re-rating as well as the otherpropositions would go some way, A scheme including a general grant would atone and the same time secure a striking increase in the independence of localgovernment, a sounder financial arrangement between the exchequer and localauthorities and a more satisfactory means of control over the growth of grants,which will otherwise continue their inexorable expansion.R.

B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,14th December, 1956.APPENDIXANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED GENERAL grant a full statistical paper showing the results for each county and countyborough, together with detailed statements of the various weighting factors, havebeen prepared. But (ignoring the slight effect on the distribution of some 2-5 millions in respect of the minor grants to be included in the pool) the broadresults can be summarised in the following table. They have necessarily been worked on provisional estimates of the grants for 1956-57 supplied by the several departments, and they are approximate. In practice the grants would be basedupon actual figures for a period as near as practicable to the date of change of system. The table takes account of the effect of Equalisation Grant since (to an authority entitled to that grant) a gain is abated or a loss is reduced.

They can for the future either reduce their expenditure and conform, ormeet the excess entirely out of rates at a cost as indicated. The reasons fornon-conformity may be various; it may in one case be some objective physicalfactor which we have failed to take into account (or more likely, an aggregationof several of them each one of which is not worth adding as a complication to theformula). In another case it may be some subjective factor, readily explicable orotherwise. Thus, Merthyr Tydfil have as an act of policy kept their classes small.They will be hit: the formula assumes the average. Nearly all the big losers arenotably high spenders on education.
