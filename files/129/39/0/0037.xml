3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50)     87 COPY NO.27TH APRIL,  1950CABINETTHE CHURCHES AND THE EDUCATION ACT.  19kUMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of EducationBefore the Election I consulted the Lord President&apos;sCommittee about the Roman Catholic Hierarchy&apos;s claim forincreased public assistance for Roman Catholic schools.      On 2hthJune, 19h9, the Committee considered my memorandum (L.P.(h9)and supported my view that we should stand &quot;by the settlementembodied in the Education Act,  19hh (L.P.(h9)  13th Meeting,Minute 6).      In general the Opposition took a similar line.2. Since then I have instituted administrative measures,about which I have been in consultation with the Hierarchyand the Church of England, to alleviate what I understand tobe their chief present anxieties.      As the 19UU Act standsthe Managers or Governors of a school which desires aidedstatus have to satisfy me    within six months of my approving the local education authority&apos;s development plan for the areaconcerned that they are able to meet their share of the costof the necessary alterations and improvements to the school.The purpose of this time limit was to ensure that the benefits of aided status would not be available for schools which hadno real prospect of meeting the full responsibilities of thatstatus.3. It is obvious that development plans cannot be executedas quickly as was expected when the Act was passed and very many of the projects in respect of which the churches arerequired to satisfy me of their  ability to raise their shareof the cost will not be implemented for a good many years tocome.      This leads to the situation which,in his recent speech,the Archbishop of Canterbury described as the churches having to satisfy me that they will be able to meet &quot;an unascertainableliability at an unascert ainable time&quot;.k-. I have, therefore, proposed to the churches that Ishould assess ability by reference to a sliding scale.      In other words I should apply progressively more lenient criteria accordingto whether the work is likely to be done within two years,  in under ten years, or in more than ten years&apos;  time.      I am notunhopeful of being able to reach an accommodation with the churches on this point and this is  as far as I personallyshould bo disposed to go.5. I realise, however, that the Hierarchy have secured agood deal of public support for their case.      Indeed, apartfrom a statement by the Free Church Federal Council which

attracted little notice,  the Roman Catholics&apos;  claims haveprovoked surprisingly little opposition from those quartersfrom which such opposition was to have been expected.    It wasdoubtless this fact which led the Archbishop of Canterbury onbehalf of the Church of England to join in asking for someamelioration of the present difficulties.6. In the circumstances my colleagues may feel disposed to make a more substantial concession to the churches.    Thiswould involve amending legislation on which it would be advisable to secure the agreement of the other interests concerned,  notably the Free Churches,,  the teachers,  the associations of localeducation authorities and the T.U.C.7. Ho measure will satisfy the Hierarchy which does notrelieve the Roman Catholic community of the entire cost of theirschools.    Such a radical alteration of the law would in my view be objectionable in principle and unacceptable to public opinon as a whole.    I have already referred to the Free Churches&apos;opposition to  the Hierarchy&apos;s more extreme claims and I wouldalso observe that the Archbishop of Canterbury in his statement was at pains to make clear that the Church of England is preparedto abide loyally by the 19M+ settlement.    There is in fact no real evidence to show that the.cost of implementing the obligations which under the existing law are likely to fall on the churchesis so crushing or intolerable as the Hierarchy suggest.    Over 2000church schools have already had their status settled.    not one existing Roman Catholic school has failed to achieve aidedstatus, while the proportion of Church of England schoolsachieving aided status is higher than was expected.    The truth, is,I suspect, that the Hierarchy do. not wish to put themselves in aposition where, having satisfied me of their ability in every case,logically.they could no longer protest their inability to meet theobligations laid upon them by the 19hh Act.8. Accepting, therefore,  that no alteration should be madein the 19hh settlement which would have the effect of increasinggrants from public funds in respect of existing church schoolsor of assisting the establishment of new church schools,  amending legislation might take the following form:-Denominational schools which have not yet become aidedor controlled might be given a third option, namely,provisional aided status.    This would carry with it mostof the present advantages of aided status (50 per centgrant from the Exchequer towards the cost of externalrepairs and such urgent improvements to the school buildings as may be required by the local educationauthority from time to time;    the appointment  Df teachersby the managers or governors, as at present;    and the giving of denominational religious instruction without restriction.)To secure provisional aided status the managers or governorswould have to satisfy me only that they were able to meet their share of the estimated annual costs of external repairs and, from time to time, of such urgent improvements as mightbe required.    When the time came when the local educationauthority (subject to an appeal to myself)  could resonably require the buildings to be brought fully up tostandard,  the managers could either satisfy me of their ability to meet half the cost and acquire substantive aidedstatus or allow the school to become controlled.Provisional aided status could become substantive at anytime if the managers or governors satisfied me of theireventual capacity to meet their ultimate obligations.

To satisfy the Free Churches, it would &quot;be necessaryfor church schools in single school areas to remain subject to the existing law andhave only two options,controlled or substantive aided status.      Such a restrictionwould not, I believe, be unacceptable to the roman catholics (who have very few such  schools)  or to theChurch of England, who have always recognised that these schools present a special problem.9. Such a proposal should not entail additional public expenditure.      On the contrary, since a number of Church ofEngland schools would probably seek provisional aided statuswhich would otherwise have become controlled (and so have all their expenses met out of public funds), there should bean appreciable, though not substantial, saving which would benefit local rates more than Exchequer funds.10. Even if my colleagues share my view that we should go nofurther than the administrative measures I have outlined inparagraph Ut I should nevertheless like their views on thesuggestion that,  if the Opposition intend to hold out any possibility of amending legislation, I should be free to refer in guarded terms to the amendment I have outlined in paragraph, making it clear, of course, that the agreement of thevarious interests concerned would be necessary.11. To sum up, I personally would limit action to administrative measures.      In view, however, of the sympathyevinced for the churches1  point of view (and of the political disadvantages which we might suffer if we let the Oppositionmake the running)  I would be ready to sponsor a limitedamendment of the Act, and I should like to be free, ifnecessary, to refer to this possibility during the forthcoming debate on my Department1s estimates.C-.T.Ministry of Education27TH APRIL, 1950.
