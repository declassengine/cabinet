this document  is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government)secretg. p. (50) 57&quot;51 st march,   1950national health service&apos;    TscotlandTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequerseeks to recover from patients for treatment some  1+2 millions.This represents on the Great Britain total net estimate a recovery of over 10 per cent;    and the same percentage appliedto expenditure on Scottish services means that we should seek to recover in Scotland the sum of about  IN? millions.      iunderstand and accept the Chancellor&apos;s contention that a recovery of approximately this size is necessitated by thepresent state of our national economy.      However, it will be appreciated that this operation can only be undertaken at theexpense of the conception of a universal free health service.I There is, as far as I can see, no hope of achieving a reduc-tion at all remotely approximating to this total by economiesi or by a tightening of the administration.      It means that we; must admit publicly, with all its political consequences, that1 we are deserting the conception of a universal free service.2. Another fact must be faced.      There is a conflict between the rate of expenditure within which the Chancellorproposes the National Health Service should run and the savings which can be secured in the year 1950/51-      It is quite possible, as I seek to show, to secure the saving of 10 per centin the 1951/52 expenditure by taking several drastic decisions;but whatever we may decide upon there is still a substantial- backlog of orders in dental, ophthalmic and other applianceswhich plainly we must discharge under the existing arrangements.By our calculations no proposed&apos; economies on these sectors ofthe service would begin to show until about January of nextyear.3. One other point should be made.       i still arn not per-persuaded that we can make reliable estimates of what the demands upon our ophthalmic and dental services will be twelve months from now.      There are some signs that demand is dropping.      Forexample, i am told that sight-testing in Scotland for the first quarter of this year is only 55 per cent of what it was in thesame quarter of the previous year.      On the other hand,  i mustadmit that there is no apparent diminution of the demand inScotland upon the dental service.      Nevertheless it may prove tobe true that later in the year our figures will show how we might keep within the level of expenditure which the Chancellorpostulates by less drastic cuts than at present seem necessary.!,   j     I So that, even if the Cabinet agree that the Chancellor should beI authorised to announce a ceiling to our expenditure,  there are&quot;-&apos; arguments,  I submit, for deciding that we should not at thisstage give any indication what methods we will use to ensurethat we will be running at the rate proposed by the chancellor and what is the earliest practicable date, i. e.  January,  1951.-1 -copy no.cabinet

k. However, even if the figures of demand over the next six months did not sustain our hopes (and I must emphasise that I cannot see any reason to be certain that they will) itis still possible to overtake the Chancellor&apos;s objectives pro-vided we accept the political consequences.5. In our search for the economies, three broad principles,  I suggest, should guide us.      We should economiseleast at the expense of those services which bring us a potential return in the shape of improved national health,e. g.  it probably is better to give children priority of treat-ment if we cannot provide for all.      Secondly, having decided upon that, we should also seek to recover where the hardshipwill be least felt, o.g. there will alv/ays be classes we want to exempt, such as old age pensioners, widows, and the com-pletely unemployed.      Thirdly,  in attempting to be guided bythese two principles, wo would still rationally search formethods that can be best justified from the political pointof view.6. It is most tempting to look for savings in thehospital services since the estimates here amount to about60 per cent of the gross expenditure.      My colleagues,however,  I submit, must appreciate that this is the area inwhich least economy can be achieved unless the service is to be cut.      i am quite sure that my colleagues, like myself, wouldnot for a moment justify the- shutting down of wards or thereduction of essential staff.      If this is accepted, then thepossibility of savings inside the hospital service becomessmall indeed.7. Minor savings are,  of course, possible.      Forexample we can restrict the reimbursement of travelling expensesof patients more narrowly than at present.      But the total costof this item in Scotland is not more than  150,000 and otherpracticable economies within the present policy framework areof the same kind, of dimension.      The best prospect seems to boa return to the tentative suggestion of the Severidge Reportthat there might be a &quot;hotel charge&quot; for hospital in-patients.Even here there are administrative difficulties.      We could hardly expect in any circumstances to collect a charge fromlong-stay patients such as those in mental hospitals and mental deficiency institutions and this type of case occupies abouthO per cent of our hospital beds.      Moreover it should beremembered that sick benefit is reduced by approximately 10/-per week after eight weeks in hospital.      ht most, therefore,we could only recover for this period.8. The general practitioner service seems to me more likely to yield a number of economies without great hardship,although the si;.:e of each economy is relatively small, e. g.there is the proposed shilling charge for prescriptions.      Istill am not certain that this was the best initial method of seeking to secure a saving.      However, we are already committed to it and politically it would seem to me almost as difficultto escape from it as to implement it.      h scheme has been worked out which gives exemption to old age pensioners, people inreceipt of national assistance, and disability pensioners.This would give us about  500,000, which the Chancellor hasalready taken into account.9. Then there is action to restrict the prescribing ofproprietary drugs, to which the Minister of Health has alreadydrawn our attention and upon which a report is expected fromthe Committee of which Sir Henry Cohen is the Chairman.      Thereis also another idea which I still think quite reasonable,although I have not so far found my colleagues receptive.      Ithink there is a range of drugs such as aspirin, laxatives,

cold creams and proprietary ointments and articles such ascotton wool and &quot;adhesive tapes, -which could be banned fromprescription and which might yield a figure approaching halfas much as the 1/- charge.      Together these items might give us a saving of between  500,000 and  600,000.10. The family doctor service in Scotland costs  5^millions a year, mostly by way of capitation payments to onedoctors.      I think I must resist any attempt to save here.But the general dental service costs almost as much - about 5 millions in Scotland in a full year - and on broad groundsI feel most strongly that this is open to criticism as notrepresenting equal value for money.      We are  seeking to makea cut of about 10 per cent in dentists&apos; fees;    which mightsave  500,000 a year.      But the real trouble in Scotland at anyrate is that demand for treatment is far in excess of the capacity of the dental profession, and the present arrangementsdo not concentrate the limited amount of dental care available on those groups in the population who stand to benefit most by it - children and adolescents.      There is no prospect that thenumber of dentists will increase sufficiently to meet the demandfor many years to come.II. There is, therefore, much to be  said for taking ourcourage in both hands and cutting back the dental service tocover only the most important groups.      Mothers could be looked after through local authority maternity services withdental services attached, and children up to school leaving age could be taken  oare of by school health arrangements, while to cover adolescents we might retain the general dental service for people up to the age of 21.12. If we are to cut in a drastic fashion, then probably the best method is to say that we will provide a completedental service for everyone born in the years from 1930 onwards,plus pregnant mothers, plus the exempted classes of old age pensioners? widows and disabled pensioners.      The attractionabout the idea of providing a complete service for people of 21and under is that not only would we be concentrating dentalskill where it is most needed, but we could adhere to this principle in future years so that progressively the whole population would be covered.      The saving from this scheme would be about  2-J millions.13. However, if this is thought to be too drastic, anotherremedy would be to impose a flat rate charge of  1 for thesupply of dentures.      This would bring in approximately  500,000a year;  and exemptions for the same classes as before would, itis thought, be offset by the deterrent charge lowering thedemand for inessential dental services.      A further modifica-tion, which I scarcely think worth while advocating,  would beto limit the charge only to the replacement of dentures;    thiswould bring in something like  200,000 a year.III. There remains the supplementary ophthalmic service.This is estimated to cost in Scotland some  2% millions in 1950-51.Under the original Acts, this is explicitly a temporary service,to operate until such time as the hospitals can take over.Abolition of the service now would not save the whole sumincluded in the current estimate, because a proportion of thedemand would in fact be met through the hospital service;    butthe inconvenience of resort to the hospitals as at presentorganised,  together with the actual economy in provision throughhospitals,  is such that trie saving might be put at not less thanSA\ millions a year.      Mothers and children certainly shouldcontinue to have their needs met through the local authority and school health cervices.

15. Short of suspending the service, there is again thepossibility of levying a flat rate charge,  say 10/- per pairof spectacles.      On the assumption that exemption for the sameclasses as before would be cancelled out by the deterrent effect of the charge, the annual saving would be approximately 1+00,000.      Or we might limit the classes of spectacle framessupplied free of charge to the less expensive varieties atpresent in use.      This would avoid any need for exemptionsand would not even need legislation, but the saving would be considerably less.16. To sum up: -(1)    the savings which the Chancellor contemplates couldnot bo achieved in the current year unless byrepudiating the contracts we have already madewith, a great section of the population;(2)    in any year the saving he contemplates could not,as far as I can see, bo achieved merely by charges and administrative economies;(3) savings of the hind he desires could be achieved bylimiting the dental service and by suspending theophthalmic service as I have described.17. The political effects would, of course, be substan-tial, but it seems equally true to me that the politicaleffects of continuing at the present rate of expenditure wouldalso be substantial.      Smaller savings, it is fair to say, ofperhaps about  2 millions a year in Scotland, could be achieved by imposing charges which are more or less nominal, but eventhese, it seems to me, would have political repercussions which,might not be very different.      We ought, therefore,  to be pre-pared to re-organise the scheme to give us reasonable savings.16. However, since the 10 per cent saving which, theChancellor postulates cannot be effected in the current year,and sinco in six months&apos;  time we may be better able to estimate the future level of demand upon the dental and ophthalmicservices  (and the demand on the ophthalmic service is alreadydiminishing), there certainly are arguments that it would be expedient meanwhile to defer taking or announcing final decisions in favour of an;/ substantial departure from theprinciple of a comprehensive National Health Service.19* I append a summary of all the possible savings.1.
