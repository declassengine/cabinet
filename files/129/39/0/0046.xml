SECRETCP. (50) 96h-TH MAY,  1950ACCOMMODATION AND CATERING FOR TOURISTS, WITHSPECIAL REFERENCE TO 1951Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI.    Ac c ommodati on1 . The problem of accommodation for visitors to the festival of Britain,&apos;to which the Lord President draws attention in C,P.(50) 91 j  is part of the more general problem of theshortage of hotel accommodation in the principal tourist centres,and especially London,  during the mair. tourist season,  about which I have been gravely concerned for some time.      Hotelcapacity in this country is considerably less than it was before the war, and Is notably deficient in London,  the one place which every visitor wants to see.      Yet we are expecting some700,000 overseas visitors in 1950, which is more than 150,000above the highest pre-war figure and, includes more dollarvisitors than ever before.      This number will undoubtedly be exceeded in 1951  and subsequent years.      Moreover,  there willbe in 1 951 many more United Kingdom visitors to London who willrequire accommodation than in a normal year, though I have been unable to get any estimate of their likely numbers.2. I have therefore been taking action during- recent months to improve the position, both generally and for 1951  inparticular.    Appendix A sets out various measures which havebeen put in hand, and which will be in operation by 1951  if not before.      Appendix B contains details of certain, other projects which are under consideration and which again would, ifrealised, make an early contribution.      I would in particulardraw attention to the Carlton Hotel, which offers us thepossibility of adding accommodation of precisely the type most needed for Americans for 200 persons, with the certainty thatIt could be ready for the opening of the Festival.      these projects all involve action by one or more Departments otherthan the Board of Trade, and I ask my colleagues for theirfullest support in bring them to fruition.3. With the exception of the Carlton, which is stilluncertain, the projects that are coming forward are relatively small,  and,&quot;  although their total effect will be valuable,  i cannot pretend that they provide a solution to the problem.Indeed I do not see how, with present policies,  any realsolution is possible.      This,  I believe,  can only be providedby the building of one or two new hotels of the Cumberlandclass with say 1,000 rooms each.      The cost of such an hotel,including furnishing, would be about  2 millions;    the buildingCOPY NO, J L-CABINE^l

work alone would coot perhaps  1millions.      (This wouldhave to be additional to the normal building programme forhotels, which-is limited to  1,5 millions for the presentyear).     Projects for such buildings exist and one could probably still&apos;be erected in time for the 1951  Festival ifbuilding licences and all facilities were granted forthwith,and if some measure    of Government assistance were promised.With building and equipment costs at their present levels and office building more attractive, both from the point ofview of the immediate return and of. the future security,  ithas so far proved impossible to get private capital put intobig new hotels unless the Government&quot; are willing to take some.share of the risk.     An outright subsidy is notnecessaryj    I believe that some form of guarantee of a partof the interest or capital, or both would suffice.      but unless we are prepared to go as far&apos; as this, we. shall not come near to meeting the demand for accommodation in Londonnext year, nor earn, the dollars in that and succeeding years which the tourist trade is capable of bringing in.      I donot under-estimate the risks nor the political difficultieswhich such Government assistance would involve, particularly as it would be necessary,  I think,  to help one or twopromoters,  to the exclusion of others and probably to thelong run detriment of some existing hotels.,    But we havealready accepted that, where it is a. question of earningdollars, discrimination and unfairness to individuals must,if necessary, be faced.      Accordingly I should like mycolleagues to agree in principle that I should endeavour toget one or two large modern hotels erected in London withoutdelay, and that in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer,  the British Travel and Holidays Association,  andthe hotel trade I should work out arrangements for providing the necessary financial backing from Government sources onthe lines I have indicated above.      This would,  I understand,involve legislation.II,    Equipment and Serviceq. Of the supplies used by hotels and restaurants,soap alone is still rationed.      No case has been brought tomy attention recently in which an hotel has complained thatthe ration is inadequate to enable it to provide toilet soapfor its guests, but they are still limited to some four4?fifths of their pre-war usage,  and an increase would undoubtedly help.      Towels,  sheets and other equipment arenow freely available, but the heavy incidence of purchase tax does prevent managements from, carrying out replacementsand improvements which are desirable or even essential forthe maintenance of standards which American visitors expect.My officials are at present discussing with the Treasury thepossibility of relieving hotels of this burden, where theyundertake comprehensive and well thought out schemes of re-equipment which can be shown to he likely to result in anincrease in dollar earnings.      While such a concession wouldbe restricted in scope,  It should lead to:a general rise in standards,  especially in London,      I hope that the Chancellorof the Exchequer will be able to; agree to these proposals.-&apos; andthat they can be brought into operation without waiting for-the necessary covering legislation so that their effect maybe felt by the time the Festival opens.

5* On hth November of last year the effect of the catering Wages Act upon the hotel industry was discussed bythe Production Committee  (P.C. (1+9) 25th Meeting, Minute 3)and as a result the Minister of Labour, asked the CateringWages Commission to enquire into the operation of the Act&quot;in relation to the means for meeting the requirements ofvisitors from overseas&quot;.      I understand that the commission is still taking evidence and that -a report may be expected in the course of the summer,      I am sure that there is general agreement on the urgency of this matter and I hopethat the Minister of Labour will bear in mind the importanceof ensuring that any recommendations which the Commission maymake concerning changes necessary for the benefit of touristsare Implemented as soon as possible and in any event beforethe 1951  season.6. On the question of licensing,  I believe that the festival Office have made certain recommendations to theHome Secretary concerning special licensing arrangements whichthey think would be desirable for the period of the Festival,and that these ere currently under consideration.      Inaddition I hope shortly to be able to put to the HomeSecretary certain proposals for relatively minor butpermanent modifications to the licensing laws in the interestsof our tourist trade,  and that he will give these mosts ymp at he t i c consideration,111*    Catering7. The problem of securing better standards of cooking,cleanliness   and service in the catering trade is of vitalimportance to the development of our tourist industry generally - it is by no means confined to 1951.      It was fromthe outset one of the main pre-occupatIons of the BritishTourist and Holidays Board (now the British Travel andHolidays Association),  and I am now asking; the Chairman ofthe Association to make a fresh appeal to the trade for their co-operation throughout the tourist season which is beginning-,and in 1951.      His hand will be greatly strengthened by thetimely removal of the restrictions imposed by the Meals inEstablishments Order, and, I hope, by the publication in thenear future of the report of the Catering Trade Working Partyappointed by the Minister of Food.IV.      conclusion. It will be apparent from the contents of this paper that if we are to make real progress in increasing the amountof accommodation available by the opening of the Festival,and in improving the standard of service offered by hotel and catering establishments, the co-operation of a large numberof Departments is essential.      So far as accommodation isconcerned, an interdepartmental working party (on which theBritish Travel and Holidays Association and the Festival office are represented) exists to co-ordinate and foward action bythe Departments concerned, but it con only achieve resultsif there is in every Department the will and determination and sense of urgency which the importance of the matterdemands.      I entirely agree with the Lord President&apos;suggestion that officials in all these Departments should be

given instructions to press on urgently with this work, andI join him in seeking the support and co-operation of mycolleagues in any measures which it may he necessary to take,some of which. I have indicated in this paper.To summarise,  therefore,  I consider that if we areto tackle this problem successfully, it will be necessary:-(a) that arrangements should be made for theerection, if necessary with some form ofGovernment financial backing, of one ortwo new hotels in London (para. 3)l(b) that arrangements should be made for apurchase tax refund scheme for well-thoughtout schemes of re-equipment for hotels with good dollar earning prospects (para, k);(c) that Departments should make every effort tofacilitate the proposals mentioned in the appendices to this paper and any other recommendations which may be put forward for dealing with the problems of accommoda-tion and catering.H.W.Board of Trade,  S.W.1;kTH MAY,  1950.

APPENDIX AMEASURES ALREADY IN HAND(i )    New Bull cling:Since 1st July, 194-9,  licences to the value of N31 ,350. have been, granted for hotel building in London,This work should provide over 500 additional bedrooms in timefor the opening of the Festival.      Included in this figure,which covers mainly extensions ana conversions, there is alsoone project for virtual rebuilding of a blitsed hotel,Kensington Palace Mansions with 100 bedrooms, and anotherfor the construction of a small new hotel in Tavistock Square.On the other hand,  at trie same time some hotels have gone outof business.     Following the meeting of the Production Committeeon 27th April, 1950 (P.C.(50) 6th Meeting, Minute 3) thepossibility of restricting change of user,  anyhow in the caseof derequisitioned hotels,  is being examined by officials,(ii)   Reservation of hotel accommodation in January last the Chairman of the British Touristand Holidays. Board.,  at my request,  asked the London hotels to reserve a. high proportion of their room during the touristseason for visitors from overseas,  giving absolute priority to dollar visitors.      As a result,  the British Hotels and restaurants Association have recommended to all their members in the London area,  that they should earmark at least kO^o oftheir accommodation for this purpose, with the priority fordollar visitors for which I asked.(iii)    London ClubsAt the same time I wrote to the Chairmen of theprincipal London clubs asking them to make a proportion oftheir accommodation available to visitors from overseas.Although few have agreed to set aside a specific number ofrooms for this purpose,  I am confident of their co-operationso far as their limited, resources permit.      Many of them have promised to extent their reciprocal arrangements forhospitality with United States and. Canadian clubs and most ofthem to encourage their members to invite their United Statesand Canadian friends to make use of the club facilities while in this country.(iv)    London Hotels Information service in order to ensure that the best possible use is madeof existing accommodation,  the British Travel and HolidaysAssociation have come to an arrangement with, the British hotel sand. Restaurants Association that they should run a CentralInformation Service from which overseas visitors would be ableto obtain information about vacant hotel accommodation inLondon,     An office has already been opened for this purpose.(v)    Information Service fox1 accommodation in Private Homes- On the model of the arrangements made at the time ofthe Coronation and the Olympic Games,  the British Travel andHolidays Association are compiling a register of accommodation in private homes and boarding houses which will be available inLondon in 1 951   and which, is considered suitable for overseas

visitors.     Requests for offers of such accommodation arebeing made in the local and national press and by the B.B.C.The (accommodation will &quot;be inspected by the British travel and Holidays Association in conjunction with the W.V.S.(The service will provide information about vacantaccommodation, but will not arrange bookings).(vi)    Liner HotelDuring the last few months i have looked closelyinto the possibility of mooring a ship in the Thames to doduty as a floating hotel in the tourist season.      There area number of practical difficulties to be overcome but thereis a possibility that one of the shipping lines may set on foot a project of this kind for 1951,  if this can be done ona c ommerc i al b as i s,(vii)    Boarding Schools,  training colleges,  etc.The Ministry of Education have circularised alltraining colleges in or near London, local educationauthorities controlling boarding accommodation   and the associations of independent schools, asking whether theywould be willing to offer accommodation to parties of&quot;student&quot; visitors from overseas during vacations.      TheBritish Travel and Holidays Association have made a similarapproach to the residential colleges of the University ofLondon,      It is too soon yet to say how much additional accommodation will be provided from these sources in 1951but it is clear that much interest has been aroused.      Atleast one new scheme of this kind will be run by one ofthe Public Schools this year.

APPENDIX BPROJECTS UNDER-CONSIDERATION(I)    The Carlton Hotel, Pall MallThe New Zealand Government &quot;bought these premises in1 9h6 and intend to &quot;build their new offices on the site..They are not however proposing to start this work until 1957,and negotiations are in progress &quot;between them and the Ministryof Works whereby the latter will take a sub-lease for thenext seven years.      This presents us with the opportunity of re-opening the Carlton as a first class hotel for thatperiod which could be done in. time for the 1 951  season.      Itis estimated that its dollar earnings direct and indirectwould then exceed $600,000 a year.      It is clear however thatwith so short a lease no hotelier would, be willing to spend the very considerable sum necessary to put this hotel intocommission again (estimated at  370,000),  and that thecapital would have to be put up by the Government.      Sincethe earnings of the hotel would not be likely to exceed 37,000 after payment of reasonable remuneration to the managing company, but before payment of income tax and profits tax,  the capital could not be amortized over 7 yearsand a net loss to the Government would be unavoidable.      If,of course, the New Zealand Government could be brought to agree to relinquish their claim on this site,  the proposition, wouldbe much more attractice, and might well go ahead without government assistance.      It is understood, however,  that theNew Zealand Government would be extremely unlikely to agreeto this,  and that the Ministry of Works would be reluctantin the circumstances even to ask them.(ii)    Re quisit i oned Hot elsThe question of de-requisitioning hotel buildings in London was considered by the Production Committee on thehth November I9U9 (P. 0.(2+9)  25th Meeting, Minute 1).    Of thesmall number . still held oil requisition or lease most must beregarded as permanently lost to the hotel industry, but itmay be possible still to arrange for the return of two orthree    small ones to that use.      In this connection it isunderstood that the Treasury,  the Ministry of Health andthe Ministry of Works are now exploring whether any of thosewhich are at present used as hostels,  largely for the accommodation of Civil Servants, might be released.(iii)    Other Hotel buildings in LondonThere ere a few other buildings which might beobtained as hotels.      One - the former Hyde Park Gate Hotel -has been released by the Ministry of Works and the BritishTravel. &amp; Holidays Association are now looking for some oneto run it.      It is undoubtedly capable of providing usefulaccommodation for American visitors, but it may be necessaryfor the Government to bear the cost of some of the workof reconversion.The Ministry of Works have also released theWashington Hotel in Curzon Street and a hotelier has beenfound to run it on commercial terms which involve no loss to

the Government,,      Final negotiations between the Ministry ofWorks and the,;prospective tenant have been in progress forsome time;    it is hoped that they will be completed withoutfurther delay since otherwise it will be impossible to open the hotel in time for this season.Another useful hotel would be the former GreatCentral Hotel at Marylebone which is now used as offices forthe Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission.The Minister of Transport has so far felt unable to.&apos;.press theBritish Transport Commission to vacate this building, but ifthey could be induced to arrange with the Hotels Executivefor its reconversion into an hotel, this would provide some300 bedrooms.Arrangements have been made for accommodation atHo. 2 Park Street which is not required for Governmentsponsored guests to be available to visitors from overseas.So long as the building is retained by the Government thisarrangement is satisfactory, but if the Government hospitalitycentre is moved,  the building could conveniently be used byone of the adjacent hotels as an annex and should be offered for this purpose before any steps are taken to dispose of itotherwise,(iv)    Service CampsAs a special arrangement for accommodating &quot;student&quot;visitors to the Festival,  the possibility of using one or twoof the Service camps near London is being investigated.      TheSecretary of State for War has supplied a list of camps whichmight be made available and an approach has been made to themain youth organisations to assume the responsibility forrunning such camps.      There is also a possibility that a sitein the Crystal Palace grounds can be made available for atented camp.      It is important that the Service departments should be prepared to lend, tents and other camping equipment for this and other similar camps which it may be possible toarrange notwithstanding the undoubted difficulties which this may involve for them.(v)    Clapham ShelterThe War Office has hitherto permitted the use ofthe Clapham deep shelter by students and others requiringcheap accommodation.      It is unfortunate that a shelter hasto be used for this purpose, but without It considerable numbers would not find a bed in London,      It is understood,however,  that the War Office are. proposing to close theshelter&apos;on 12th June since it involves them in a loss and itwill suffice for their purposes if it is put on &apos;a care andmaintenance basis for use in emergency.     Negotiations are inprogress between the Ministry of Works, the British Travel andHolidays Association and certain youth organisations with aview to arranging for the shelter accommodation to continueto be available to civilians.      It is to be hoped that these can be speedily concluded;    and in the meantime it isimportant that the War Office should continue to run theshelter on the present basis.
