Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (SO) 95!2nd May, 1950CABINETCONVERSATIONS WITH UNITED STATES AND FRENCHOFFICIALSMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will wish to have a broad outline of the progress of the currenttalks between United Kingdom, United States and French officials, the object ofwhich is to prepare the way for my meeting next week with the United states secretary of State and the French Foreign Minister, and for the ensuing sessionof the Atlantic Council.2. Both in the bipartite talks between officials of the United Kingdom andthe United States and in the tripartite talks with the Americans and the Frenchthe agenda this week has been confined to broad and general topics. From to-day,the discussions will break down into sub-committees and will begin to deal withsuch specific subjects as Germany, South-East Asia, Colonial questions, &amp;c.3. The first object in both bipartite and tripartite meetings was to establish a general agreed estimate of the present situation. The outcome of this discussion was a broad agreement that the trend of power in the last twelve months has been,on balance, unfavourable to the West, and that the present situation is one of danger; that, on the other hand, there were certain weaknesses in the Sovietposition; and that it was not likely that they would be prepared to run a serious risk of war for several years. They might well, however, adopt a more forwardpolicy than hitherto in the &apos;&apos; cold war.&apos;&apos; and it was therefore necessary to examinevery carefully the various points in the world where they were looking for weakspots in the Western system, of which Germany was clearly the most important.4. There was general agreement that the Western Powers cannot permitfurther Soviet advances in the world which would materially strengthen the Sovietposition; that they must therefore build up, while preserving their economic progress and development, a framework in which the maximum industrial andmilitary strength can be deployed; that this can only be done by the combinedresources of the Atlantic Pact Powers acting in the interests of the whole of thefree world; and that within the Atlantic Pact Organisation there must be speciallyclose understanding and co-operation between the United States, the UnitedKingdom and France.5. In the bipartite talks with the Americans there has been a close review ofthe relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States and of the role which each should play in the world. The Americans have expressed them-selves as anxious to regard the United Kingdom as a country with which theymust have the most intimate possible relations; and methods have been suggested for improving the machinery of consultation at all levels and at all times. On theother hand, the Americans have made it clear that so far as European affairs areconcerned we must not expect them to regard us as entirely different from the other european Powers. On the economic side, they have said that they believe theUnited Kingdom ought to give more of a lead in Europe, particularly in suchmatters as the European Payments Union (E.P.U.), but they have definitely statedthat they do not think we should accept any form of organic union with Europe.Their thinking on this is clearly not very far advanced, and the matter will bediscussed further with them.38707
6. The leader of the United States team of officials, Dr. Jessup, has madeimportant statements, both in the bipartite and in the tripartite meetings, aboutthe intention of the United States Administration to find a means of supportingEuropean countries after the end of the European Eecovery Programme. At thesame time the United States Delegation have raised the question whether theUnited Kingdom, by concentrating on the attainment of viability at all costs in1952, is prejudicing the development of desirable wider European interests and insome cases American, policy, owing to the hostility which some of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s actions arouse in the United States. We have, of course, strongly pressed our own point of view on this and the Americans have shown an under-standing of the need for changes in their own economic policy. The americans have also drawn attention to doubts which are felt in some American mindswhether we are wholeheartedly devoted to the objectives of the tripartite declaration of September 1949.7. Perhaps the main subject that has been dealt with in detail has beenthe question of developing the machinery of the North Atlantic Pact. There is complete agreement that something must be done to co-ordinate and give impetusto the various committees responsible for the elaboration of common defence plans.There is also agreement that some new step forward in the political field isnecessary within the Atlantic Pact. Out of these two points of agreement has emerged a suggestion that the Atlantic Council when it meets in May should setup a committee of Deputies of the Foreign Ministers, charged with the duty ofco-ordinating all the activities of the Atlantic Treaty. There are, however,differences of opinion both on the status and the character of this committee andon the exact field which it should cover. The French, supported apparently bythe Americans, feel very strongly that if any real defence is to be provided forthe Western Powers, this committee must be influential and effective and that itmust have a Secretary-General of high standing and great energy who will givedrive and impetus to its work. Secondly, the French have expressed a strongview that the North Atlantic Treaty is not a proper forum in which the general economic problems of the area can be considered. Their main reason is unwilling-ness to see Germany associated with the Atlantic Pact in any shape or formnow or, apparently, at any time in the future. They therefore suggested that theO.E.E.C., while continuing to deal in its present form with purely european economic questions, should be expanded in some way by the association of theUnited States and Canada for the purpose of dealing with economic problemscommon to Europe and the Western hemisphere. We have pointed out thatthis system both atrophies Article 2 of the Pact and involves separation betweenthe economics of defence and the general economic life of the countries concerned,which is unrealistic; and that in our view there is no need at present to take any decisions which would prejudge the possibility of the Atlantic Pacfs eventuallybecoming a forum in which broad economic questions are handled. The french attitude (which may or may not represent the final views of the French Govern-ment) seems to be dictated partly by reluctance to conceive of Germany&apos;s joiningfully in the life of the Atlantic community, and partly by a desire to make sure that any new machinery on the non-military side shall be firmly established inParis.8. As regards relations with the Soviet Union, there has been discussionof the question whether the time is ripe for any attempt to reach a settlement by-negotiation with the Soviets. All three delegations have admitted that they see no prospect whatever of such negotiations being successful and have declared, withvarying degrees of emphasis, that they have no intention of being drawn intothem if they can help it. On the other hand, the French have laid great stress onthe need to show that the Western Powers still place peace and disarmament in the forefront of their basic objectives and that they are not ruling out the possibilityof a settlement. The Americans also thought that we should be prepared to con-sider the possibility of talks with the Russians if opportunity should arise at alater stage or if there were a really strong movement of opinion in favour ofmaking a last attempt to get agreement. They stated, however, that it was notthe intention of the United States Government to negotiate with the Soviet Unionunless the United Kingdom and French Governments agree on the need for sucha step, and unless agreed positions are worked out in advance. It has been madeentirely clear that in our view general negotiations are unlikely to succeed until such a time as we have built up a &quot; situation of strength &apos;&apos; in the West, towards
ffhich the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact itself has made a great, but only initial,c0ntribution.9. There have also been exchanges of view on common policy towards thesatellite States in the matter of diplomatic representatives, &amp;o, and on a commonattitude towards Yugoslavia.10. The French have suggested a Joint Declaration to be issued by the three powers, or perhaps by the Atlantic Council itself. The chief object of this declaration would be to set forth the aims and ideals of the Western Powers; tointroduce the theme of peace and prosperity; to draw attention (as it wereincidentally, however) to the sacrifices which must be made if peace is to besecured; and generally to wrest the propaganda initiative from the Soviet Union.11. I would emphasise that these conversations are entirely without commit-ment on either side. There has been free and open discussion of basic questions,but no decisions have been taken in the name of Governments.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2nd May, 1950.
