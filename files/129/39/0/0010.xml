Printed for the Cabinet.   March 195039...... v-tfj   -   **CP. (50) 6031s  Mar-c/i, 1950CABINETEFFICIENCY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOCIALISEDINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council.   1.   In &quot; Let Us Win Through Together &quot; we said :-&apos;&apos; Labour will not be content until each public enterprise is a model of efficiency and of social responsibility. The Government must be free to take all necessary steps to that end.&quot;It is now for us to decide what is needed in order to give effect to this undertaking-2. During the last Parliament the Socialisation of Industries Committeesupervised the execution of the socialisation programme and exercised a generaloversight over Government policy in relation to the Boards after they had been set up. We held two meetings with the Chairmen of the principal Boards, atwhich we discussed some of the chief questions affecting the relations of Parlia-ment and the Government with socialised industries, as well as specific mattersmore directly within the province of the Boards in which Ministers were interestedbecause of their general responsibilities for the efficiency of the socialised indus-tries. In addition, the parent Ministers have of course been in close touch withthe Chairmen. I propose in this paper to deal with the main issties which have arisen.3. Let me say first of all that, if the paper is for the most part critical, itis not because I fail to recognise the magnitude of the credit side of the account.The Ministers and the Departments concerned have done a fine job in the accom-plishment of a smooth and efficient transition from private to public ownership.The Boards responsible for the socialised industries also deserve congratulationupon their success in getting their vast enterprises into being with a remarkableabsence of friction and dislocation. Moreover, improvements in these largeservices take time, and the Boards inherited undertakings which in some cases hadbeen badly neglected.4. In some respects, however, the Boards have not fulfilled our hopes, andthere is a good deal of disillusionment even among supporters of the principlesof socialisation. Let us by ail means make full allowances for the difficulties and let us give time for improvements. But we must also try to estimate the way in.which things will develop in the future, and it is our job to see that the Boardsdo everything humanly possible to overcome their difficulties with the minimum of delay. Some administrative questions of great importance arise which deservea high place on the agenda of the Government: the time which Ministers, bothindividually and collectively, give to their consideration will be very well spent.Efficiencyb. There is a widespread feeling that the Boards are not operating asefficiently as might be expected; in particular, the Boards seem to suffer from,some of the vices of large bureaucracies and the interests of the consumers seemto be given second place. High prices and dirty coal how often we heard about them during the Election campaign. As an illustration of the same point, only38505 B
2the other day I had a letter from the Political Secretary of the Royal ArsenalCo-operative Society complaining in strong terms about the poor quality of coal and telling me that the Co-operative Union were making representations to theNational Coal Board on the subject.   I know that there are arguments on thepother side, but the fact is that dirty coal is regarded as evidence of failure to&quot;look after consumers.6.   What can Ministers do to secure greater efficiency IManning of Boards7. First and this is important Ministers choose the top management. Wehave done quite well in this respect so far; but vacancies constantly arise, and Iam not altogether satisfied that we are well placed to pick out able though notnationally famous individuals from the general body of industry in the country as a whole. The first generation of Board members had to include a good many&quot;names &quot; men with public reputations for past work: we now want to pickyoungish men of brains who will make their reputations on the Boards.Relations with Boards8. The Ministers must establish the right relationship between themselves and their Departments on the one hand and the Boards (aiid in particular the chairmen) on the other. There must be give and take on both sides, and friendlyinformal relations are likely to secure that broad harmony of outlook between theGovernment and the Boards which is necessary for success. Friendly relations should not, however, prejudice the position of the Minister as the senior partner,or prevent him from speaking with the full weight of his authority where, after hearing the arguments, he disagrees with a Board.A useful purpose can also be served by periodical meetings between ministers collectively and the Chairmen. They are a reminder of the features which associalised undertakings the Boards have in common, and that the parent ministers are spokesmen of a common policy and have the collective backing of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. .9. Without setting up in the parent Departments staffs which would dupli-eate work which is proper for the Boards themselves, Ministers ought to get toknow the right questions to ask, and their Departments can help them by calling attention to trends which seem to call for enquiry. Relative prices and costs,financial results, production figures, and so forth, may, if properly analysed, point to matters which are seriously wrong.Common Efficiency Unit10. The Socialisation of Industries Committee have, however, felt for aconsiderable period that further checks on efficiency are required. In any large-scale organisation there is a tendency to self-satisfaction and complacency,particularly if it is a monopoly not subject to competition or detailed outsidescrutiny. We are all familiar with the dangers red tape, over-cautiousness,resentment of criticism, empire building, esprit de corps which puts the organisa-tiori above the community, and so forth. We know how difficult it is to grapplewith these troubles from inside. Moreover, we seem as a country to suffer&quot; atpresent from a tendency in some respects to over-organisation, and the boards have not been immune from this tendency.11. It was with these considerations in mind that, as long ago as June 1948,the Socialisation of Industries Committee decided that, at a joint meeting, weshould raise with the Chairmen the question of outside checks on efficiency. Onbehalf of Ministers, I suggested the establishment by the Boards themselves of asmall common efficiency unit. Such a unit would be the servant of the boards and responsible to them; the Boards would use it to advise them on specificproblems which they referred to it for investigation. The common efficiency unitwould bring an outside point of view to bear and would collect experience fromall the socialised industries. The unit would bring in outside consultants, as necessary. This suggestion did not commend itself to the Chairmen, and we hadanother, largely abortive, discussion with them about control of efficiency on28th February, 1949. We made it clear to them that we were not wedded to the specific proposal of a common unit, and invited them to make any alternative suggestions which they might have to offer.   It was not until December 1949 that
they submitted their further observations, and.they then repeated their objectionsto the common efficiency unit -,; proposal without putting forward any alternative ideas.12. The attitude of the Chairmen to this important problem leaves muchto be desired. I am afraid that they are unwilling to face what to them may bethe unpleasant fact that not only Ministers, but also Parliament, will insist on some satisfaction about their degree of efficiency. I do not wish to suggest thatthe solution is necessarily to be found in a common efficiency unit responsible tothe Boards. It would be feasible to have a unit which was responsible to ministers or to Parliament. Some people have even suggested that there should be anindependent outside &quot;efficiency audit&quot; (whatever that may mean). All theseideas, good and bad, should be discussed on their merits. There can be no justifi-cation for the ostrich-like refusal of the Boards to face the problem which onesuggestion was intended to meet.Periodical Enquiries13. In addition, I think we should decide that each socialised industry shallbe subject to periodical enquiries, on the lines of the committees (Crawford,Ullswater and Beveridge) which have been set up to enquire into the B.B.C., and,as in that case, some Members of Parliament, might well be included. I amdisposed to think that in the normal course intervals of the order of seven years would be right, but in the early days of socialisation there may be a case for notwaiting so long. Much depends upon the steps which are taken to meet the needfor a more continuous scrutiny of organisation and management. The periodicalenquiries would be concerned with broad questions of policy and structure.Control of Prices and Charges14. Some day we may have to review the price fixing provisions of the socialisation statutes, and the Socialisation of Industries Committee has initiatedinvestigations. But the results belong to the future. One alternative to thispresent procedure is Governmental fixing of prices for socialised industries, butwe should have to think hard before we took that step.Public Accountability15. There is a growing feeling that there should be more parliamentary discussion, and, as the Cabinet are aware, various schemes for increased Par-liamentary control usually based upon some form of supervision by a parliamentary Committee-have been ventilated. This feeling extends to theParliamentary Labour Party, and nobody who stood in the General Electioncan fail to realise that, whatever the theory may be, the electorate holds theGovernment answerable for the deficiencies of the Boards, even in matters of day-to-day management.16. The Socialisation of Industries Committee have in mind that, whenthe Chairmen of the Boards are seen on the subject of efficiency, we should saythat we can no longer resist the pressure for fuller public accountability. Morepublic discussion will be healthy for the large-scale public monopolies for whichthey are responsible.   We would, therefore, propose : .. (a) To give further opportunities in both Houses for Parliamentary debatesabout the socialised industries, and in particular to propose the amend-ment of the Standing Orders, so that three days are set aside forthis purpose each year, in addition to the opportunities for debateswhich already arise in the course of Parliamentary business forexample, in Committee of Supply. These days should not be whollyat the disposal of the Opposition.(b) Without prejudice to the restriction of Questions about day-to-day-management, to make clearer to Members of Parliament the kinds of question which they are entitled to put down under existing rulings.(c) To announce our intention that the socialised industries shall be subjectto periodical enquiries by outside committees (see paragraph 13 above).(d) To indicate that, unless the Boards accept some system affording a con-tinuous independent scrutiny of their organisation and management,they may find themselves answerable on details of management to an38505 B 2
existing or newly-created Parliamentary Committee. The boards would find this inconvenient, and it would bring Parliament intomatters of day-to-day management, with the almost certain conse-quence that Ministers would have to exercise a closer supervision oversuch matters. These difficulties would, however, be of secondaryimportance if the result was to improve the Boards&apos; efficiency. Ourdoubt is whether it is the best way of securing this object. It seemsto us that it would be more likely to be secured by some expert body on the lines indicated in paragraph 11 above; but, if the Boards areunable to make satisfactory proposals of their own, we shall introducewhatever methods of ensuring efficiency seem to us appropriate.Consumers&apos; Consultative Machinery17. Experience has fully confirmed our view that, with publicly ownedmonopolies not directly accountable to Parliament, there must be effectivealternative means of bringing the opinion of consumers to bear upon them. It istrue that the machinery which was set up for consulting consumers is still inrelative infancy, but there are unfortunately few, signs that it is taking real rootor, without big changes, will provide consumers with the safeguards they need.Something can be achieved by better publicity, and the Socialisation of industries committee have asked.the Ministers concerned to see to this. But that is not enough, and we are proposing at an early meeting to consider what else is required,including the possibility of a thorough enquiry into the structure and workingof the consumers&apos; consultative machinery, with a view to a report on the purposes which, in the light of experience up to date, it can most usefully serve, and on theadministrative or legislative measures which are required to make it fully effective for these purposes.Relations with Workers18. Among the most important of the provisions of the socialisation measures were those relating to the relations between management and workers. It isbssential, from every point of view, that the socialised industries should be modelundertakings in this respect. This cannot yet be said to be true, but good progress has been made in the establishment of joint consultative machinery. It wasencouraging to find frsm the T.U.C., when we saw them last July, that the unionsgreatly value what the Boards have already done and are anxious to co-operate in developing these arrangements to the full. As the T.U.C. agreed, one field inwhich there is room for improvement is the education of trade union members of joint consultative committees in the nature of their responsibilities in this capacity and in the industry as a whole and its problems; I want to see them equipped tohold their own in discussions with management on such matters.Public Relations19. Generally speaking, the Boards&apos; conduct of their public relations hasbeen disappointing. This is not merely a matter of publicity, but of demonstra-tihg to the public, by the actions of every employee, that they are behaving as goodpublic servants. Their insensitiveness to public relations is reflected in their general attitude to public accountability, and apart from much needed steps tomake their activities better known through the media of publicity, the improve-ment of their public relations also demands energetic attention to staff trainingin the courteous handling of the public, sales methods, and the sympathetic treat-ment of complaints and suggestions. A list of the measures which were recom-mended by a Working Party which the Socialisation of Industries Committee setup in January and which the Committee have in general endorsed is annexed tothis memorandum. It will be seen that there is a good deal to be done, and that ministers and Departments also have an important part to play.20. The Cabinet will not wish to go into the details, but I hope that theywill agree that all Ministers should be asked to share in the task of informing the public with care and accuracy about the socialised industries the purposes for which they were set up, how they are organised and how they are discharging their obligations as public servants, the opportunities which the Consumers&apos;Councils give individual and organised consumers to express their views, andthe responsibility upon everybody to make a success of these great national experi-ments.   I am not thinking of party political speeches-though they have their
place of course- but of the big task of exposition and education in the facts and principles; there is much ignorance even on such elementary points as whetherthe socialised industries are run by civil servants and whether their losses fall onthe taxpayer. The Socialisation of Industries Committee have agreed that factualbriefs shall be prepared for the use of Ministers, and of course the parent Minis-ters and I myself will be ready to help our colleagues in preparing their speechesas far as we can.Summary of Conclusions21.   To sum up, I ask the Cabinet to agree that: (i) The Chairmen of the Boards should be told that the Government are not satisfied with the existing arrangements for checking the efficiency oftheir organisation and management. The Chairmen should be askedfor their urgent views upon the alternative forms of efficiency check,and told that in default of a satisfactory proposal from them we propose to introduce whatever arrangements seem to us most suitable(paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 (d)).(ii) The principle of periodical inquiries by outside committees into the socialised industries on the lines of the Beveridge inquiry into theB.B.C. should be accepted, and this decision should be announced when-ever seems most appropriate: The frequency of the inquiries should depend upon circumstances (paragraph 13).(iii) Various measures designed to increase the opportunities for Parlia-mentary discussion of socialised industries should be introduced(paragraph 16).(iv) Ministers and Departments should take action on the lines approved bythe Socialisation of Industries Committee as regards the public rela-tions of the Board; and all Ministers should be asked to help asmuch as they can in their speeches to improve public understanding ofthe socialised industries (paragraph 25).H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W-. 1,31st March, 1950.ANNEX&apos;,  Recommendations of the Working Party on Public Relations of the socialised Industries(1) The conception of public accountability should underlie all the public relations activities of the socialised industries. These activities will be most effective when they can demonstrate and publicise the fact that the Boards arebehaving as good public servants. The experience of the G.P.O. in the thirtiesshowed what a well-conceived public relations policy can do to promote the under-standing and the co-operation of the public where good service is already being given.(2) All of our specific recommendations of course involve some action by.Ministers, but we think that in summarising them it will be convenient to classifythem as far as practicable according to whether the main responsibility forcarrying them out rests with Ministers personally; Ministers through Govern-ment Departments; Departments and Boards jointly; or the Boards.(3) Action by Ministers personally. (i) The more Parliamentary discussionthere is the better from the public relations point of view. Ministers should take full advantage of Parliamentary discussions to act as spokesmen not only forthe Boards but for consumers and the community as a whole in relation to the boards. Members of Parliament should be encouraged to ask more questions on subjects on which Questions are admissible.
;, (ii) There should be more Ministerial speeches and broadcasts explaining the work of the Boards and the Consumer Councils.(iii) In making appointments to Boards, Ministers should take into, accountaptitude for public relations in the broad sense. ,(4) Action by Government Departments. (i) The parent Departments andan appropriate official Committee should keep under review the steps which theinformation services can properly take to remove misunderstandings about the socialised industries, including the possible preparation of a White Paper andfactual briefs for the use of Ministers.(ii) Active Consumer Councils can indirectly make an important contributionto the public relations of the Boards. Parent Departments, as well as Ministers,should help to publicise the Councils, and wherever practicable arrange for their annual reports to be published separately from the reports of the Boards. the council&apos;s themselves should be advised to take special pains over publicity andshould as far as possible open their proceedings to the press; where the pressare not admitted, the Chairman should hold a press conference after each meeting.The question of an alternative title for the Councils (e.g., the &quot; Public&apos;s CoalCouncil&quot; &amp;c.) should be examined.(iii) The possibility of increasing the representation of the Boards on regional Boards for Industry should be considered.(5) Joint action by Departments and Boards. (i) Departments, Boards and private interests should co-operate in publicity about research and development.(ii) There should be closer consultation on staff training, industrial relations and other aspects of public relations between the Boards themselves, the Boards and government Departments, and the Boards and private industry. The possibilityof setting up a standing consultative committee on public relations, on which bothDepartments and Boards are represented, should be considered.(6) Action by the Boards.-Sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) below, arise out of matters on which Ministers have a specific locus.(i) Annual reports should not merely give a factual account of the year&apos;work but should interpret policy and future plans. Experiments should be madewith popular versions for sale to the general public and employees. Full use should be made of popular illustrated publications.(ii) Good personal service to the public should be one of the objects of stafftraining.(iii) Better industrial relations and morale can be furthered by internalprogrammes of educational publicity land suitable general publicity.(iv) The Boards should arrange for social surveys into public attitudes.(v) There should be systematic speechmaking by Board members and officials.(vi) There should be systematic contacts with schools and colleges.(vii) Frank relations with the press are most important. ,(viii) Complaints and suggestions should be readily received; this shouldbe impressed on the staff through training, indoctrination and supervision.(ix) Full advantage should be taken of salesmanship as an aid to public relations.The National Coal Board could with advantage be more visibly associatedwith publicity on coal utilisation. Joint publicity by the Boards concerned andappliance manufacturers should be considered.(x) We make suggestions for improving the public relations of Area boards and Regions, particularly in Scotland. Particularly in gas, more publicity aboutthe industry as a whole should be done from the centre.(xi) &quot; Prestige &quot; campaigns in the more expensive publicity media may be inexpedient at the present stage.(xii) The Board&apos;s public relations divisions should not be confined narrowlyto publicity. They should also be able to interpret public attitudes and advise on the public relations aspects of policy generally.
