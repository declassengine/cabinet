Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950Copy No.^CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS germany memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 16th November, 1949 I circulated to my colleagues a memorandum(OP. (49) 237) describing, the results of my meeting in Paris with the UnitedStates Secretary of State (Mr. Acheson) and the French Foreign Minister(M. Schuman), at which we reached agreement on our policy and programme for germany during the period of the present Occupation Statute (which is due tobe reviewed at any time between September, 1950, and March, 1951), and on the steps to be taken to bring the German people and the German Federal Republicby progressive stages into closer association with the West. My colleagues may find it useful to have for their information an assessment of the present position.2. On the basis of the Paris discussions the Allied High Commissioners inGermany and the Chancellor of the German Federal Republic drew up and signed on 22nd November the so-called Petersberg Protocol. In that document theparties recorded their joint agreement to work for the incorporation of the german federal Republic into a peaceful and stable European community of nationsthrough its participation in international organisations in particular its promptadmission as an associate member to the Council of Europe and as a full member to the International Authority for the Ruhr and through the exchange of com-mercial and consular representation with other countries. The German federal republic undertook to maintain the policies of demilitarisation, disarmament,denazification and decartelisation and to conduct its affairs according to demo-cratic principles. On the part of the Allies, provision was made for relaxation of the restrictions on German shipbuilding and for modification of the dismantlingprogramme.3. The Petersberg Protocol remains the basis of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;present policy towards Germany. So far as Germany is concerned, one of thechief purposes of the forthcoming discussions with Mr. Acheson and M. Schumanwill be to review the progress made in the implementation of the programmethere laid down.4. In some respects progress has been disappointing. The German federal chancellor has not yet felt able to go before the Federal Assembly with thenecessary assurance of success to seek its approval for the Federal Republic&apos;sassociate membership of the Council of Europe. There has been a disposition onthe German side to seek to bargain for better terms. The French Government,by the timing and handling of their recently-concluded agreements with theGovernment of the Saar placing their relationship with that territory on a con-contractual basis, gave the Germans an opening for these questionable manoeuvres.The Germans cannot be expected to welcome the separation of the Saar fromGermany pending a final settlement of the territory&apos;s status at the peace treaty or to refrain from efforts to secure full equality of status. But it would in my view be a mistake to make further substantial concessions to Germany until thePetersberg Agreement has been fully implemented.5.   Subject to this, and taking care always to avoid any impression that weare courting German favours, we must persevere with our policy of graduallybringing the Federal Republic into closer association with the West.   A german delegation is already playing a useful part in the Organisation for European38626SECRETCP. (50) 8026ih April, 1950
Economic Co-operation, and Germany has this year been elected to the ExecutiveCommittee. The Federal Government has joined the International Authorityfor the Ruhr and has been invited to join the International Wheat Council and&quot;the Central Rhine Commission. German observers attend meetings of a numberof other international organisations. The Federal Government was invited toappoint Consuls to London, Paris and New York and, after some delay due to thedifficulty of finding acceptable and suitably qualified candidates, has now namedfor the London post Herr Schlange-Sehoeningen, a prominent German who has worked closely with us during the occupation period and should prove an acceptable representative. , i6. Apart from the important psychological and political difficulties of associating Germany with the West, a more formal but not unimportant problemarises in connexion with those international organisations whose charters, as inthe case of the Statute of the Council of Europe^ provide that full membership is only open to States. It would be a natural consequence of our policy of supporting the German Federal Government, and of declining to recognise as aGovernment the Pieck Administration in the Soviet Zone, that we should regard the German Federal Republic as constituting the German State. Until theWestern Powers agree to do so they will not be able to associate Germany withthe West as a full and equal partner.7, We must of course proceed to that goal by stages. But I consider that,once the German Federal Republic has taken the initial step of joining the Councilof Europe as an associate member, and provided that the conduct of the federal government is such as to give us grounds for believing that they sincerely intend to co-operate loyally with the West; we should begin to prepare the way for its full membership of this and other international organisations as the GermanState. To accomplish this it would be necessary that the Western Allies should agree to restore to the German Federal Government the control over foreign affairs at present vested in the Allied High Commission, subject of course to the retentionof reserved powers in the fields of security, foreign trade and so on.8. It is sometimes argued that by taking such steps we should make morefinal the division of Germany into East and West. I do not think these fearsare well founded. The division of Germany is ah accomplished fact. since they established the Pieck Administration in their zone of occupation in october last year the Russians have worked hard to build up its authority on the basis ofthe Communist-dominated Socialist Unity Party. Communist control is nowfirmly established and the ground has already been well prepared to ensure the consolidation of that control at the elections that are to be held in the Soviet zone in October of this year. Communist propaganda is showing increasing aggressive-ness in its attacks on the Western sectors of Berlin and on the Federal republic and in its claims that it is only a matter of time before Western Germany fallsunder Communist domination. Such propaganda has so far had very little effect in Western Germany. But neither its actual effect in the East nor its potentialeffect in the West should be underestimated.9. Our most effective counter to such propaganda is to make a success ofthe German Federal Republic and its association with the West. The western allies must show by their deeds as well as their words that they are pursuing anall-German policy of their own, that they are working for a united Germany withits capital in Berlin, and that they regard the Government of the Federal Republic,as the Government, and the only Government, of Germany.10. The need to build up the authority of the Federal Government is increased by the grave internal difficulties wuth which it is faced. Germaninexperience in the working of a democracy, the heed to rebuild a central Govern-ment from the ground up after the hiatus brought about by the war and the occu-pation, the difficulty of controlling under a Federal system the older-establishedgovernments of the Lander, the lack of any Federal police force-these have allproved inevitable handicaps. Despite them the political and administrativemachine is taking shape and exercising increasing responsibility1. A further step towards the restoration of normal political life was recently taken when the allied high Commission raised the ban on the licensing of new political parties. Theposition of the main democratic parties seems fairly well established and neitherthe Communists on the left nor the extreme nationalist groups on the right have yet succeeded in making any appreciable headway.
11.   But the problems to be dealt! with remain formidable.   The destructionof the war, the influx of refugees from the East and the loss of Eastern markets and sources of supply have contributed to the present unemployment, shortage of:housing and investment capital, and heavily adverse foreign trade balance.   The,Federal Governments attachment: to the theory of the &quot; free market economy,&quot;including a somewhat reckless import policy, may have aggravated these problems,in some directions, but they could not in any event have been solved.   They must bedealt with first and foremost by the Germans themselves, but it is in the interest ofthe Allies to give all assistance in their power.12. There remain, moreover, certain tasks in the economic field to which theWestern Allies are committed. The foremost of these is the deconcentration andreorganisation of the coal, steel and chemical industries. This work has been delayed by inter-Allied disagreements, but it is hoped that it may now proceedmore rapidly and that the Anglo-American decision to let the Federal Governmentdetermine the future ownership of the coal and steel industries of western germany will be accepted by the French Government. Secondly, there is theproblem of the level of industry, including the maintenance of limitations on theproduction of steel and merchant shipping. I consider that, until the federal government has shown itself ready to co-operate wholeheartedly with the Westthrough such organisations as the Council of Europe, these restrictions should bemaintained in their present form. We shall, however, be under heavy pressure to agree to some relaxation of these security measures later on when the policy of bringing Germany fully into a Western system is more advanced. Finally, thereremain to be completed certain parts of the reparations and demilitarisationprogrammes. I consider that the first, given the modifications introduced last november, can and should be carried through. It should be finished by about theend of this year. As for the second, I am having an examination made of whatremains to be done in the way of demolishing air-raid shelters, landing strips,quays, &amp;o, in order that the whole programme may be reviewed in the light of present security considerations and of our general policy towards western germany.13. Special consideration must be, and is being, given to the problem of berlin, where the solution of the economic difficulties of the Western sectors, thereduction of unemployment, the fostering of orders for local manufacturers andthe maintenance of assured communications, are a necessary precondition of therestoration of stable political conditions. The Western Allies are in an exposed-position in Berlin and the Russians and their East German Communist puppetsare clearly determined to undermine it. We must let there be no doubt about our intention to stay in Berlin but, in order to be able to stay there, the Allies mustbe prepared to give high priority and to see that the Germans do likewise to thenecessary measures for dealing with the economic and political problems of theWestern sectors and for maintaining the confidence and morale of the local population.14. Confidence is indeed an important factor in the whole German situation.The Germans are acutely conscious of their own exposed position in Europe andof the fact that one of the main fronts of the cold war runs through their country.They know they could not defend themselves and are sceptical of the willingnessor ability of the Western Allies to protect them in an emergency. They knowtheir place is with the West, but are not yet convinced of the strength or effective-ness of the Western association. For their part the Western Allies naturallyenough are not yet convinced of the trustworthiness or goodwill of the GermansIt is only by efforts on both sides that confidence can be developed. The western allies must concentrate upon building up their own strength and unity, throughthe Brussels Treaty organisation, the Council of Europe, the O.E.E.C. and above all the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The more evidence we show of ourown determination and power and of our ability and willingness to help Germany,the more we avoid any impression that we are soliciting or depending upon anyhelp or contribution from her, the greater will be the chances that Germany willjoin us as a willing and acceptable partner.E.
