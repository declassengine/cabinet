Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1950SECRET CopyNo1.     3CP. (50) 613rd April, 1950CABINETCHINESE CIVIL AIRCRAFT AT HONG Kong memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Ministerof state as the Cabinet are no doubt aware, there are at present in Hong Kong some70 civil aircraft which formerly belonged to two Chinese organisations named the china National Aviation Corporation (C.N.A.C.) and the Central Air TransportCorporation (C.A.T.C.).background. The circumstances in which these aircraft came to be in Hong Kong andin which their ownership came to be in dispute are described in the attached cir-cular telegram sent by the Foreign Office to posts abroad (Annex A). It is unnecessary to summarise here the complicated legal actions which have been before the Hong Kong courts. It will suffice to say that ownership of the aircraft is claimed by Chinese Communist interests and also by American interests whopurport to have purchased from the Chinese Nationalist Government in december last the aircraft and all other assets of the two Chinese Corporations mentionedabove.Repercussions on A nglo-A merican Relations3. Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s Government have for the past four monthsbeen under constant pressure from the United States Government to take actionto prevent the aircraft and other assets of the Chinese Corporations from falling into the hands of the Communists, and the State Department have categoricallywarned His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington that failure on the part ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent this might seriously endanger the con-tinuance of Marshall aid and of the Military Assistance Programme. the ambassador has added that a decision favourable to the Communists would have aserious effect not only on Anglo-American relations but even on the personalposition of the United States Secretary of State, which is somewhat precariousat the moment. The atmosphere in the United States about China is highlycharged and very embittered. His Majesty&apos;s Government have maintainedthroughout that, while they sympathised with the desire of the United StatesGovernment that the aircraft should not fall into Communist hands, the questionof their ownership was one for determination by the Hong Kong courts, that itwould, not be proper for His Majesty&apos;s Government to interfere with the normal course of justice, and that we should not take any executive action in regard tothis dispute which could justifiably be interpreted by either party as partial.Repercussions in Hong Kong and China4. In taking this line we have had to take account not only of the pressure towhich we have been subjected by the United States authorities, but also of theeffect which any action which we might take in regard to the aircraft and other assets might have upon our position in Hong Kong and upon our relations withthe Chinese Communists, The strength of our position in Hong Kong depends38526 b
largely on our not becoming involved in Chinese political issues, the maintenanceof an impartial administration and on insisting that the rule of law must prevail.Any departure from these principles might have serious repercussions.5. If the Hong Kong Government were considered to have acted in bad faithby showing partiality to American interests, the Chinese Communists might beprovoked to organise strikes, disturbances and sabotage. They could also imposean economic blockade which would deprive the colony of essential food supplies from South China and have disastrous effects on its prosperity and trade. Apartfrom the possibility of disturbances in Hong Kong being fomented from outside,there is a serious risk that they would break out spontaneously if forcible measures were taken to prevent the departure of the aircraft, or to remove from Kai Takairfield the Communist employees who are now in charge of them. In this con-nection it should be mentioned that some of the powerful trade unions in HongKong, including those whose members are employed on the waterfront and incertain important public utility undertakings, have strong Communist affiliations.Moreover, the Governor has repeatedly warned us that the continued presenceof these aircraft increases the general risks of fire or damage by typhoons to the safety of this crowded airport (which is, of course, also the R.A.F. base).6. As regards the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government, the position is that, though de jure recognition was formallyaccorded on 6th January, 1950, normal diplomatic relations have not yet beenestablished. In the course of preliminary and procedural discussions, the PeopledGovernment asked two questions, one relating to the position in the United nations and the other to the position of Kuomintang nationals and property in Hong Kong(the case of the aircraft no doubt had a bearing on the latter question). Thoughreplies to both questions were returned by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires on17th March, no further progress has been reported, and it is by no means incon-ceivable that the People&apos;s Government do not intend to finalise their negotiationsuntil it is clear whether His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to prevent the departure of the aircraft from Hong Kong. In these circumstances any executive action by His Majesty&apos;s Government which could be shown to be demonstrablypartial in favour of the United States might stultify the whole of our policy towards China. Our failure to establish normal diplomatic relations, thoughnearly three months have elapsed since de jure recognition was accorded, is alreadyan embarrassment and is having an adverse effect upon our interests generally in China. If relations are not finally established, the effect upon the UnitedKingdom&apos;s position in the Far East will be serious. Towards the end of last year the Foreign Minister of the People&apos;s Government declared that the aircraft in hong Kong were a &quot; sacred property right&apos;&apos; of his Government and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government bore full responsibility for their safety. A broadcast fromPeking also stated that United Kingdom property in Shanghai was being held as security for the aircraft.Present Legal Position7. So long as the actions were pending in the Hong Kong courts and theinjunctions granted by those courts remained in force, neither of the parties tothe dispute was in a position to remove the aircraft and other assets from HongKong, although they remained there in the possession and control of formeremployees of the two Corporations who had declared their allegiance to the central people&apos;s Government. But on 23rd February judgment was given in two of the actions before the Supreme Court, and the injunctions which had previously pro-tected the aircraft and other assets were discharged. The effect of the judgmentwas to declare that the aircraft and other assets were in the possession and controlof the Central People&apos;s Government and that the general principle of juris-dictional immunity enjoyed by sovereign States prevented the trial of any issue inthe courts as to the title to the aircraft or other assets or the appointment of areceiver on behalf of the American interests. There was thus, so far as the courtswere concerned, nothing to prevent the aircraft being flown away or the other assets being removed from Hong Kong. An appeal was subsequently lodged bythe American interests against the decision of the court and is due to be heardon 28th April, but an application for the reimposition of the injunctions hasbeen refused. This refusal has resulted in renewed protests from the UnitedStates Government, who, while not formally questioning the inviolability of the hong Kong courts, have expressed their astonishment that, With an appeal still
pending, the courts were,unable to provide interim protection for their interests.It follows from this that, from the point of view of Anglo-TJnited States relations,no development of this case could be more harmful than that the aircraft andequipment should leave Hong Kong.. for Communist China in circumstances inwhich the United States interests had heen unable to plead in the courts their case for ownership of the; two Corporations&apos; assets.8. The lifting of the injunctions did not, however, remove all obstacles tothe aircraft being flown away, as their certificates of registration and the licencesof their pilots had been suspended in November last by the Chinese Nationalistauthorities. Subsequently both the Chinese Communists and the Americansclaimed to have registered the aircraft in their territories. As the ownership ofthe aircraft was still iii dispute and as it was not possible to determine which ofthe two registrations claimed was the valid one, the Governor of Hong Kongwas instructed, on 4th March that, if it became necessary for him to do so, heshould exercise certain powers available to him under the Colonial Air NavigationOrder to prevent the aircraft being flown from Hong Kong. (These.instructions were repeated after the debate in the House of Commons on 31st March, in orderto ensure, that the position was not compromised before the Cabinet had: had anopportunity of considering it.) It was not considered possible (except by the useof emergency powers, which was regarded as undesirable because it would amountto overt action against the Central People&apos;s Government which it was our policy to avoid) to prevent the removal of the other assets, and in fact large quantitiesof equipment (spare parts and machinery) have already been shipped in a Britishvessel from Hong Kong to, it is believed, destinations in China. It also appearsthat there is no power at present to prevent the aircraft themselves being dis-rriantled and similarly removed from Hong Kong.Defence Aspects -9. It should be mentioned here that the Commanders-in-Chief in the Far Easthave expressed concern lest the aircraft in Hong Kong should be allowed to fall into Communist hands, since they might, inter alia, be used in operations againstIndo-China. The Chiefs of Staff considered the representations made by the commanders-in-Chief, and stated that they would regard the removal of theaircraft to China as serious. They did not, however, consider that the militaryobjections to the removal of the spare parts referred to in paragraph 8 above were so serious as to override the political objections to their being detainedunder &quot;emergency &quot; powers. As regards both the aircraft and the spare parts,the Chiefs of Staff acknowledged, that the rule of law must be allowed to prevail.They also agreed that, in the interests of internal security in Hong Kong, if it became necessary to use force to detain the aircraft, the measures ta,ken should notbe such as to provoke serious repercussions (such as widespread disturbances orstrikes).Views of A attorney-General10. In the meantime, as the situation referred to in paragraph 8 appearedto be without precedent, and as there were doubts whether the action which theGovernor of Hong Kong had been instructed to take to prevent the aircraftbeing flown from the Colony might not be open to challenge in the Courts, the issues involved were referred to the Law Officers, and the Attorney-General&apos;opinion is annexed (Annex B).  His advice may be summarised as follows&apos;:- (a) The Governor probably has power under Article 60 of the Colonial air navigation Order to prevent the aircraft flying until the Courts decide which of the two registrations is valid. This power is, however,primarily conferred to ensure the safety of aircraft in the air andthere is some doubt whether it can properly be exercised to hold upthe aircraft pending a decision as to the right registration.(6) The expediency of using this power is a matter of policy. Its exercisewould not be particularly convincing from a political point of view,since the original Chinese registration was at most only suspended.The validity of the Governor&apos;s actions might be challenged in theCourts by the Chinese and the Courts might ultimately hold either that he did not possess this power or that the Chinese registration isthe valid one. (If the Courts held that there was no power to detainthe aircraft, a judgment for damages might be given against the38526 b 2
Hong Kong Government. On the other hand, if the Courts decidedthat the Governor had powers, but the Chinese claim for registrationwas admitted to be valid, no claim for damages would be allowed. Itwill be noted from sub-paragraph (a) above that the Attorney-Generalthinks that the Governor has these powers.)(c) If such an embargo is placed on the aircraft, it ought to be continued until the registration issue is decided. This issue will not necessarily be determined by the present litigation.(d) There are, so far as the Attorney-General knows, no other powers theGovernor could use to prevent the aircraft flying and no powers atall to prevent the aircraft being dismantled and removed by land,except (in either case) such special statutory powers as the Governormay take.Security and Export Control A spects11. The United States Ambassador called on the Minister of State on30th March and requested that, as aircraft spare parts, servicing equipment,aviation fuel and lubricants fall within the categories of products which theUnited Kingdom has in principle agreed should be &quot; embargoed to communist china,&quot; the stores previously belonging to the Chinese air lines should not be permitted to leave Hong Kong.The position as regards security restrictions on exports from the UnitedKingdom and from Hong Kong is as follows : (a) Exports from the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has for sometime operated a complete embargo on the export of arms, including aircraft, to China. Thus, a statutory control prohibits, export of aircraft, assembled or dismantled, and aircraft engines, but not spare parts. Any spare parts which it is necessary to withhold in our security interests are withheld by administrative action. Aircraftregistered outside the United Kingdom are not subject to licensingcontrol if (i) they are re-exported within six months, provided therehas been no change of ownership, (ii) if they are engaged on regularair services.In addition, the United Kingdom has undertaken, provided that othercountries who are concerned with trade to China come into line, toextend the controls to cover all strategic goods the export of which to eastern Europe is at present prohibited or restricted. This would include aviation fuel and lubricants but not ordinary workshopequipment. The negotiations with other countries are still proceedingand the controls cannot yet be brought into force.(b) Exports from Hong Kong. Although the Governor of Hong Kong has power, under the Arms and Ammunition Ordinance, to exercise controlover the export of arms and ammunition and has exercised it in the caseof certain exports to China, that power does not apply to aircraft, air-craft engines or any other items of the equipment now in question.Moreover, the Governor has no power at the moment to extend the controls to cover other strategic goods on the lines now being discussed by the United Kingdom with other countries.It will be seen, therefore, that to prevent the removal from Hong Kong ofthese aircraft (assembled or dismantled) and associated equipment under theSecurity controls would involve the assumption of new powers by the Governor,and if legislated were enacted for this purpose it would inevitably be directly related in the minds of the Chinese both inside and outside Hong Kong to thepresent dispute.Possible Sources of Action12. We have hitherto maintained the thesis that we must not interferewith the course of the law, and that if the courts decide in favour of the Coffi-munist intereste, the aircraft should be allowed to depart. One of our majordifficulties is, however, that at no time yet has the court been in a position to pro-nounce an opinion on the questions :  (a) Where ownership in these aircraft now rests; and(b) which of the registrations claimed is valid.
It seems that question (a) will not be answered in the present litigation, at anyrate as regards the C.A.T.C. aircraft, for the reason indicated in paragraph above, and question (&amp;) is not raised by this litigation. Equally, it seems unlikelythat the Hong KongGovernment can by ordinary process of law get a ruling bythe court on these issues. There is, however, open to us a course which the attorney-General has orally indicated might be followed if, as a matter of policy,it were desirable to do so, namely, that the Governor of Hong Kong, under thepower which he has under Article 60 of the Colonial Air Navigation Order, should issue instructions for the detention of the aircraft on the ground that he is notin a position to;say which of the purported registrations is valid. We proposethat, before we take this action, both the United States and Chinese governments should be informed of our intention to do so. If the Chinese Governmentchallenge this action in the court, our hope is that the Hong Kong Governmentwill be able so to frame its defence as to bring squarely before the court thenecessity of deciding : (a) Which of the various registrations is valid; and(&amp;) (if possible) where the ownership of these aircraft now rests.13. We cannot, however, be sure that the Chinese Government wouldchallenge this action in. the court (which, as indicated above, involves a waivingof their jurisdictional immunity). Moreover, as things stand it would be opento them to dismantle the aircraft and remove them to Communist territory, in thesame way as they have been removing the spare parts and other equipment. it therefore remains to be considered whether, by the use of any other powers, the hong Kong Government should take&quot; steps to prevent the removal of dismantledaircraft or other spare parts and equipment, at any rate until the question oftheir ownership is decided.14. The possibilities of taking such action under the law of Hong Kongappear to be as follows :  .(a) There is power under Regulations made by the Governor under the Hong-Kong Emergency Regulations Ordinance of 1922 (as subsequentlyamended) to prevent the departure from Hong Kong of aircraft,whether whole or in a dismantled state, if it appears to the governor to be necessary or expedient in the public interest to prevent their departure. This regulation, although made and published, has notyet been brought into force, and to justify bringing it into force theGovernor will have to be satisfied that an occasion of emergency or public danger in Hong Kong requires that it should be brought intoforce. It seems very doubtful whether the Governor can be satisfiedof any such emergency in relation to these aircraft. This regulationdoes not cover spare parts or equipment for aircraft.(b) There is power under Regulations made in Hong Kong under enactmentssimilar to the United Kingdom Supplies and Services Acts to prohibit the export from Hong Kong of any article, but for supplies and services purposes only. Any action which the Governor tried to takeunder this legislation would be clearly open to strong criticism as ause of powers for purposes quite different from those for which theywere conferred.(c) The possibility of using the Arms and Ammunition Ordinance has beendiscussed in paragraph 11 above, and it has been shown that an amendment of the law would be required.conclusions as regards the danger of the aircraft being flown away into communist china, the Attorney-General has advised that we are on reasonably strong ground in asking the Governor to prohibit the aircraft from flying from Hong Kongunder Article 60 of the Colonial Air Navigation Order. He has suggested thatthe Governors order be expressed in the widest possible terms so as to prohibitaccess to the aircraft for any purpose (e.g., dismantling) except necessary main-tenance, although he expresses grave doubt whether the Governor&apos;s powers go beyond what is required to prevent flight. But this matter should be left for decision by the Courts1. Having regard to the strength of the recent United Statesrepresentations we feel that this is the least that we can do.
The existing powers of the Governor would not, however, suffice to preventthe Communist interests from exporting the spare parts. To achieve this special legislation would be needed, and we do not think that this would be justified atpresent.The courts may decide that existing powers are not sufficient to prevent the dismantling of the aircraft and their removal by road. In this event special legislation would also be needed. This would involve a major decision of policyabout which we would propose to submit recommendations to our colleagues if and when the situation arises.J. G.cessation April, 1950.K.

C.A.T.C., as was subsequently discovered, had never been formally incorporated and was thus merely a department of the ChineseNationalist Government.2. Early in 1949, when the Chinese Communist forces were nearingShanghai, these two organisations had been permitted to establish their head-quarters in Hong Kong and their maintenance base and workshops on Kai Takairfield there. In June, following the reinforcement of the Royal Air Force at hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government requested these two organisations toremove their main establishments from Kai Tak, and this request was frequentlyrepeated throughout the subsequent months. As far as C.N.A.C. was concerned,the request was strongly resisted, in particular by those interests representingPan-American Airways. The Governor of Hong Kong pointed out both to therepresentatives of C.N.A.C. and to the United States Consul-General that, apartfrom the great inconvenience caused to the Government of Hong Kong by thepresence of the aircraft and the maintenance depots, there was a serious risk ofthe Chinese Communist Government laying claim to the aircraft, in view of thefact that the Communist advance was proceeding rapidly and that in all proba-bility the Communists would become the Government of China and, as such, thesuccessors to the Nationalist Government and the inheritors of their property.The replies which the Governor received were to the effect that Pan-American
Airways hoped to continue their operations in Communist China and that theirchances of doing so would have been prejudiced if they had assisted C.N.A.C.to move from Hong Kong to Formosa.3. On 9th November the managing directors of C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C..together with eleven of the aircraft in question, flew to Peking and defectedto the Communists. The seventy aircraft remaining in Hong Kong were promptlyclaimed as Communist property by some 4,000 of the employees of the two companies, who had likewise defected. Shortly afterwards, the chinese communist Foreign Minister declared that the aircraft were held in Hong Kongas &quot; a sacred property right&quot; of the Chinese People&apos;s Government, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government bore full responsibility for their safety. A broadcast fromPeking also stated that United Kingdom property in Shanghai was being held as security for the aircraft.4. On 13th November the Chinese Nationalist Foreign Minister informed the Hong Kong Government that the registration certificates of the aircraft andthe pilots&apos; licences were cancelled.5. On 24th November the pro-Nationalist boards of C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C.took proceedings in the Hong Kong courts against a number of individualemployees, named as the defendants. The courts granted the plaintiffs injunctionsrestraining the defendants and their servants or agents from removing theaircraft. On the subsequent day the employees were granted similar counter-injunctions against the boards.6. On 1st December the United States Government informed His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Washington of their concern at the fate of the aircraft, and enquire whether there were any &quot; extraordinary measures &quot; which the Governor of HongKong could take to prevent the aircraft from falling into the hands of the communists. At about the same time the plaintiffs&apos; solicitors pointed out to the attorney-General of Hong Kong that the employees named as defendants were not actually the individuals who had custody of the aircraft and that they didnot know who these were. They contended that the Hong Kong authorities hadthe duty to ensure that the injunctions were not disobeyed. To this end, it wasagreed between the plaintiffs and the Attorney-General that representatives ofthe plaintiffs, under adequate police protection, should visit the airfield in orderto name the individuals in custody of the aircraft and warn them of the termsof the injunctions. The police duly appeared on the airfield at the date andhour arranged, but the (Chinese Nationalist) plaintiffs&apos; representatives neverturned up, and the plaintiffs&apos; solicitors subsequently informed the commissioner of police that they had refused to do so as they were afraid of being publiclybranded as anti-Communists. Presumably for the same reason the plaintiffs1representatives failed to collect the defecting employees&apos; passes to enter the airfield for cancellation, with the result that these employees have remainedthroughout in physical possession of the aircraft.7.   On 12th December two United States citizens, General Chennault andMr. Willauer, signed a contract with the Chinese Nationalist Governmentpurchasing all the assets of C.N.A.C, and C.A.T.C., including the pan-Americaninterest.   Shortly afterwards, these two individuals sold their interest under the previous contract to another entity, in which they had a controlling interest,I incorporated in the United States, called Civil Air Transport, IncorporatedI (henceforth described as C.A.T., Inc.).1 8. On 28th December the Chinese (Nationalist) Embassy in LondonI officially informed His Majesty&apos;s Government of the transfer of the shares andI assets to General Chennault and Mr. Willauer, and requested His Majesty&apos;sI Government to inform the Hong Kong Government that these two gentlemen1 were now the sole owners of the aircraft and of the other assets of C.N.A.C andI CA.T.C. At this time, General Chennaults and Mr. Willauer&apos;s legal repre-I sentatives, with the support of the United States Government, expressed to his Majesty&apos;s Government their concern lest the question of the ownership of theI aircraft should be still undecided by the courts on the date of recognition ofI the Chinese Communist Government by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and urgedI the latter to arrange for the Hong Kong courts to be informed that they recog-I nised the validity of the sale of the aircraft to American interests. They were told that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to make certified copiesI of the texts of the Chinese notes available to the plaintiffs, they were not prepared
to comment on them or to make any communication to the courts about them, asthe question of the validity of the sale was one for the courts to decide. TheUnited States legal representatives also informed His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe aircraft had been registered as American owned by the United States CivilAeronautics Administration on 19th December.9. On 22nd December an application to the court to join General Chennaultand Mr. Willauer as additional plaintiffs was rejected on the grounds that their interests conflicted with those of the present (Chinese Nationalist) plaintiffs. Theycould not both be the owners of the aircraft.10. On 30th December the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires in Londoncomplained to the Foreign Office that the officials of C.A.T. Inc. had no access to the aircraft, in contrast to the pro-Communist employees (who were in physicalpossession). He added that sabotage was occurring and that vital parts werebeing removed. Could anything, he asked, be done to expedite the legal procedure?He maintained that the title of the United States Company to the aircraft oughtto be clearly established, and asked for a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment shared the concern of his Government that the aircraft should, not fall intoCommunist hands. Following a consideration by Ministers of this approach, theUnited States Embassy was informed on 3rd January that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment sympathised with the anxiety of the United States Government toprevent the aircraft from falling into Communist hands, that, in the view ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, the Chinese Nationalist-United States interests could,by means of appeals to higher courts, ensure that the final decision was delayedfor from nine to twelve months and that, if the verdict of the court was favour-able to the plaintiffs and if the defendants failed to appeal, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would assist the American interests to obtain immediate possession.The United States Embassy were also told that, if the allegations of sabotagewere confirmed, His Majesty&apos;s Government presumed that the American interests would arrange for the court to be requested to protect the machines.11. Throughout this period the very strongest pressure was being brought tobear upon His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Hong Kong byC.A.T. Inc., and particularly by General Donovan, its representative in HongKong, both to influence the legal proceedings and to take executive action in itsfavour. In particular, General Donovan, in an interview on 4th January withthe Governor, in which he was accompanied by the United States Consul-General,maintained that the Chinese Nationalist Government&apos;s certificate that the aircraft were now the property of C.A.T. Inc. could be regarded as such conclusive evidence of United States ownership that the Governor could disregard theinjunctions made by the courts and could, by police action if necessary, hand overthe aircraft to the company&apos;s representatives. The solicitors retained by theChinese Nationalist authorities, who also accompanied General Donovan at the interview, were unable to explain how the Hong Kong Government could take suchaction consistently with the law. General Donovan thereupon threatened thewithdrawal of Marshall aid and advised the Hong Kong authorities to be&quot; practical.&quot; He subsequently gave a press conference in which he accused the hong Kong authorities of being unco-operative and repeated his demands forexecutive action, to which the Hong Kong Government replied with a publishedstatement confirming their refusal to take any executive action, in a matter whichwas sub judice, which would have the effect of forestalling or frustrating thecourt&apos;s findings.12. The United States Government have never associated themselvesformally with the demands of C.A.T. Inc. that pressure should be brought tobear on the Hong Kong courts or with its allegations that the courts were notacting impartially, and subsequently the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires inLondon, when the point was put directly to him, stated that his Government wasnot asking the Hong Kong Government to take any &quot; illegal &quot; executive action.At the same time, the United States Government were clearly nervous of theinfluence of the directors of C.A.T. Inc. in American internal politics and hesitatedopenly to dissociate themselves from any of the company&apos;s accusations, though there are signs that they have recently urged the company, in its own interests,to employ more moderate tactics.13. It is not necessary to summarise here the highly complicated legal proceedings which took place during the months of January and February, owing
to the number, of eases instituted by the American interests in an attempt,,hitherto unsuccessful, to obtain a hearing of the merits of their case for ownership-of the aircraft. Nor is it necessary to summarise the numerous representations made by the United States Embassy, most of which consisted of allegations, oftenunsupported by evidence, of sabotage of the aircraft by the employees, of com-plaints that the American interests had never been given an opportunity ofarguing their case for Ownership of the aircraft in the court; and of warningsof the consequences of their acquisition by the Communists. In reply, the embassywas reminded of the independence of the Hong Kong courts and was assured thatthe Hong Kong Government had taken such action to protect the aircraft as waspossible in the very difficult circumstances.14. A word must be added here about the implications as regards this caseof the withdrawal by His Majesty&apos;s Government of de jure recognition of theChinese Nationalist Government and the de jure recognition of the Chinese Peoples-Government on 6th January. During December the American parties, who werenaturally anxious for a court decision to be reached before the transfer of recognition took place, did their best to expedite the court proceedings; andthe United States Charge d&apos;Affaires enquired of the Foreign Office whether&apos;recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Chinese People&apos;s Governmentwould affect these proceedings, to which the reply was given that it might or might not. After the transfer of recognition had taken place, the United StatesCharge d&apos;Affaires requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide that it shouldnot be retroactive in effect, and he was told in reply that this was a matter forthe courts to decide. On 30th December the Governor of Hong Kong received fromthe Chief Justice of Hong Kong, for transmission to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, a questionnaire on various points affecting recognition,the reply to which contained the statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government had ceased to regard the Nationalist Government as the de facto government of various parts of China as from the dates on which it ceased to be in effective control ofthose parts of Chinese territory. To a question subsequently received from theChief Justice as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the People&apos;sGovernment as a de facto government at any date between 1st October and 5th January, the reply was given that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised,during that period, the People&apos;s Government as the de facto government of those parts of China in which it had established effective control, and as from the date on which it established such control. The United States Government were much concerned that His Majesty&apos;s Governments replies should be framed in such away as to make it clear that Flis Majesty&apos;s Government had extended to theChinese Communist regime no recognition, either de facto ov de jure, before5th-6th January. But His Majesty&apos;s Government, while sympathetic towards this concern, felt themselves obliged, in drafting the replies, to be influenced bythe sole consideration of ensuring that they were both accurate and informative.-15. On 23rd February the Chief Justice of Hong Kong rejected two appli-cations made to the court by CA.T. Inc. that receivers of the assets of C.N.A.Cand C.A.T.C. should be appointed, whose function it would have been to hold,these assets in safe custody until the court had decided to whom they belonged.In his judgment, the Chief Justice found that the property was in the possessionand control of the Chinese People&apos;s Government and that it would be a violation of the immunity of a foreign Sovereign Power to make an order directing thatthe property in its possession and control should be delivered over to a receiver.He based this finding on the fact that the aircraft were in the physical controlof employees who declared that they held it on behalf of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment and accepted orders from high officers of that Government. On thesame day, the injunctions on the aircraft were removed at the request of the defendants.16. So far as the court was concerned, the Communist employees were nowfree to move the aircraft. It must however be pointed out here that the chief justice, immediately after delivering his judgment, took certain steps to makeit clear that he expected an appeal to be lodged. It must also be emphasised that the opinion expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the effect that afinal decision could be delayed for from 9 to 12 months by means of appeals to higher courts (see paragraph 10 above) presupposed that the plaintiffs conductedtheir legal case with reasonable ability, and also that C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C. were38526 c    :
i)oth private companies, even though most or all of their shares might be Govern-jnent-owned. It was only subsequently ascertained that C.A.T,C. had been,a-department of. the Chinese Nationalist Government. But even at this stage&quot; itappeared that an appeal against the judgment on the grounds that the C.N.A.C.aircraft were not in the possession or control of the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment was likely to be successful, although this was improbable as regards C.A.T.C.There seemed to be little if any evidence that the acts of the Chinese PeopledGovernment were such as to exclude C.N.A.C. from possession of the aircraft.Indeed, it seemed that the Chinese People&apos;s Government intended to control them through a Communist managing director of C.N.A.C. It was therefore not clear to His Majesty&apos;s Government why the plaintiffs did not immediately appeal in both cases, and this fact was pointed out informally to the United States Embassy,who were warned that, if the plaintiffs failed to play their cards right, HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not be blamed for the consequences.17.   On 10th March it was learned that the plaintiffs had in fact appealedagainst the judgment, but that no fresh injunctions had been applied for.18. As a result of the removal of the injunctions, the Hong Kong Govern-ment were placed in an embarrassing situation. The Hong Kong courts hadtaken no decision as to the ownership of the aircraft. The original registration-certificates of the aircraft had been cancelled by the Chinese Nationalist Govern-ment (see paragraph 4 above). The aircraft had subsequently been registeredboth in (Communist) China and in the United States, and both sides had presented-or were about to present registration certificates. Article 18 of the Chicago Con-vention on International Civil Aviation lays down that an aircraft cannot bevalidly registered in more than one State. These aircraft should be registered. in the State to which the owners belong. But ownership was in dispute; and acceptance of one or other set of registrations would have in effect much the same result as an administrative decision in favour of one side or the other on the-question of ownership. Pending the advice of the Law Officers of the Crown theGovernor was instructed to accept neither set of registrations and to prevent theaircraft from flying.19; &quot;Whatever the eventual outcome of this dispute may be, its consequences-Cannot fail to be harmful to the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of hong Kong. If the Chinese Government obtain possession of the aircraft, theywill doubtless use them for purposes detrimental to Anglo-American defence interests in the Far East, though His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that theUnited States Government are inclined to exaggerate this aspect. In any case,Anglo-American relations will suffer to some extent, though it is to be hoped thatthe United States Government can be led to appreciate the injustice of laying the blame on to His Majesty&apos;s Government. If the American parties obtainpossession of the aircraft, our relations with the Chinese Government, on whichthe welfare and the security of Hong Kong so largely depend, will suffer, andretaliatory action may he taken against our commercial interests in China. Apossible pointer in this direction is provided by an enquiry put to His Majesty&apos;charge cTAffaires at Peking, in the course of his preliminary and procedural dis-&quot;cussions with the Chinese Foreign Minister on the establishment of diplomatic relations, as to His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude in regard to Chinese Nationalproperty in Hong Kong. The blame for the whole situation rests on the shouldersof the American aircraft interests concerned, who, despite frequent warnings,failed to remove the aircraft to Formosa before the other parties could lay claimto them, and the United States Government cannot be absolved of all responsibility in this respect. As regards the eventual outcome of the case, it would appear thatif the courts are able (i.e., because claims of immunity are either rejected orwaived) to decide the question of ownership of the aircraft, the Chinese Com-munists will be granted possession of the C.A.T.C aircraft, numbering thirty-nine,and the United States Company, C.A.T. Inc., possession of the C.N.A.C aircraft,numbering thirty-one. Although the United States Government will doubtlessreact strongly against an eventual decision which allows the Chinese Governmentto obtain possession of more than half the aircraft, it is possible that, if the finaldecision can be postponed for some months, Sino-American relations may have entered a new phase, or the United States Government and the American interests concerned may have adopted a more realistic attitude towards the case and towards the part played in it by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Britishcourts. On the other hand, apart from the strain on Anglo-American and Anglo-Chinese relations caused by the lengthy dispute, the continued presence of the
aircraft in the over-crowded colony of Hong Kong presents the Government ofthe colony with already formidable and steadily increasing problems. HisMajesty&apos;s Government, as the United States Government have been told, sympathetic-thise with the latter&apos;s desire that the aircraft should not fall into Communisthands But we have a greater interest: to safeguard the world-wide reputation of British courts for impartiality.20. The principal requests and complaints which we have received fromthe American side in connexion with the dispute, together with our comments on them, are tabulated below, as they may prove useful in replying to criticisms :  (1) We have been asked to influence the courts in various ways, and to intervene in the court procedure. We have replied that our courtsare independent, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no locusstandi for intervention without a request from the courts.(2) The courts have been accused of partiality, particularly in not enabling the United States parties to state their case, and in allowing injunc-tions to be issued in favour of the employees on 24th November. There-is no foundation for this accusation; and we have replied that anyremedial action in such cases must be sought in the courts by Counselfor the American interests.(3) We were asked whether the court proceedings could be expedited. this request was made at a time when the American interests were anxiousto obtain a decision before His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised theChinese People&apos;s Government. We replied that we had no powers to intervene in the court procedure, and that, moreover, we had no evidence that it had been unduly protracted.(4) We have been asked to take various forms of executive action to enablethe American interests to remove the aircraft and to prevent theCommunist authorities from doing likewise. We have replied thatwe can take no such action which would have the effect of forestallingor frustrating the courfs findings.(5) Officials of the Hong Kong Government have been accused of beingunco-operative. This charge is a natural consequence of the view heldby certain of the American interests that we ought to be prepared togive them every assistance, regardess of the fact that the case is subjudice.(6) We were asked to recognise the validity of the sale to C.A.T. Inc. ofthe share-holdings of the Chinese Nationalist authorities in C.N.A.C.and CA.T.C. We replied that the question of validity of the sale wasone for the courts to decide.(7) We were accused of failing to take proper steps to prevent sabotage ofthe aircraft. We replied that, if allegations of sabotage were con-firmed, we presumed that the American parties would arrange forthe court to be requested to give an order for the further protectionof the aircraft.(8) We were accused of denying access to the airfield to United states officials and permitting it to Chinese Communist personnel. Wereplied that the blame for this rested with the Chinese NationalistAuthorities, who failed to cancel the passes of the employees who werein physical possession of the aircraft at the opening of the dispute.Moreover, United States officials have been allowed, by arrangement,to visit the airfield in circumstances which would not lead to a breach of the peace.(9) We were asked whether recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of theChinese People&apos;s Government would affect the court&apos;s decision, andto provide that such recognition would not be retroactive in effect.As regards the first point, we replied that recognition might or mightnot affect the decision. As regards the second point, we replied thatthis was a matter for the courts to decide.(10&apos;) We were informed that any recognition of registration certificates of aircraft other than United States certificates without the title to theaircraft being legally established would amount to sanctioning theconfiscation of the property of United States citizens. We &quot;have instructed the Governor of Hong Kong to decline to recognise eitherset of certificates, pending receipt of the advice of the Law Officersof the Crown.38526D
21. While the information given in the preceding paragraph may be used-as a background for replies to enquiries, it is important that no inference shouldbe given that political considerations have in any way influenced the handling ofthis case by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by the Government and courts of hong Kong. It should be clearly emphasised that this is a purely legal dispute,in regard to which we are determined to act with the strictest impartiality.Moreover, apart from the desirability, on general grounds, of safeguarding the reputation of British courts for inviolability, it must be remembered that only by adopting an attitude of impartiality in the handling of this case can we providetenable answers to complaints from both, the American and Chinese parties to the^dispute, one of which will inevitably be dissatisfied with its outcome.[Copied to United Kingdom High Commissioners in all commonwealth countries and to the United Kingdom representative, Dublin.]ANNEX BOpinion-Gentlemen,I am honoured with your commands signified to me in Sir Eric Beckett&apos;sand Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray/s letter of 18th March, 1950, No. 22931/18,requesting me to advise on certain questions that have arisen consequent on thepresence at Hong Kong of civil aircraft.From a political if not also from the military point of view this matter is obviously one of great difficulty and embarrassment. Unfortunately, it is not one for which any obvious legal solution can be found since it is not covered byany precedent and the existing powers are not such as to indicate any course ofaction which the Executive authorities in Hong Kong can pursue without fearof legal repercussions or the charge of political discrimination.On the information at present available, it is impossible for me to express anyconfident view where in law the title to the aircraft concerned may now rest.Nor, indeed, is there much to be gained by canvassing this aspect of the mattersince a decision as to title by the Executive, whether on the advice of the English -Law Officers or not, would be of no legal effect and would not entitle the executive to detain the aircraft as against one claimant or another. Even if it were perfectly clear that the title to the aircraft was now vested in the American Company, thiswould not enable the Executive, in the absence of any statutory power or CourtOrder, to intervene and detain them as against another claimant. As the matternow stands, the decision of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong is that all the air-craft concerned are in the possession and control of the Chinese Central PeopledGovernment and that the general principle of jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by sovereign States prevents the trial of any issue in the Courts as to the title tothe aircraft or the appointment of a receiver on behalf of adverse claimants.Although this decision is under appeal, it would be improper for the executive to act on the view that it is not at present binding, still less that it may later be reversed by a superior Court.The injunctions which previously protected the aircraft and preserved thestatus quo having been discharged, there seems now to be no legal reason save suchas may arise under the Colonial Air Navigation Order (to which I presently refer)to prevent the aircraft being flown away or otherwise dealt with by those in whose-possession and control they apparently are and have been found by the court tohe. I understand that the American company which claims a title to the aircraft and which, as I am told, is appealing from the decision of the Supreme Court, has failed in its original application for an injunction protecting the aircraft pendingthe hearing of the appeal. This is unfortunate. The facts before me are insuffi-eient to enable me to express any view on the basis on which such an injunctioncould be sought, nor can I advise on the chances of the full court of Hong Kongnow granting such an injunction. But I think that it should be suggested to theAmerican interests concerned that every possible effort should be made to appeal against the refusal to grant an injunction. If one were obtained, it would atleast keep the matter in suspense for some time and it may be that this is the most that can be hoped for.It remains to consider whether, in the event of an injunction not being^obtained or of its eventual discharge, there is any way in which the Executive canintervene to prevent the aircraft being removed to China.   The only suggestion
which has been put before nie as to possible Executive intervention is that steps might be taken under the provisions of the Colonial Air Navigation Order, 1949.Under that Order, it is clear that aircraft may, inter alia, not be flown unless thereis in force in regard to them a certificate of airworthiness valid according to thelaw of the country where the aircraft are registered and, by Article 60, theGovernor of a Colony may detain such aircraft as appear likely to be flown in breach of the Order I think that the powers under the Order properly extend to commercial aircraft belonging to the Government of a foreign State since theprinciple of extra-territoriaiity applied to ships does not, in general, apply to civil aircraft (Paris Convention, 1919, Article 30 : Chicago Convention, 1944,Article 3) and the aircraft here in question do not seem to be &quot; State aircraft &quot;within the limited meaning of that term as used either in the Chicago convention or the Colonial Air Navigation Order. Since it appears that the aircraft hadbeen registered both in America and in China, it is said that the Governor might take up the position, basing himself upon Article 18 of the Chicago Convention,that since one registration or the other could not be valid and he was in no positionto judge which was the valid registration, he could not be satisfied that the variousregulations would be complied with and was, therefore, entitled (although hewould not be bound) to detain the aircraft under Article 60. It is to be observedthat the powers under the Colonial Air Navigation Order were created primarily to promote safety in the air. I think, however, that they are wide enough topermit their exercise for another purpose, although it is desirable not to advertisethe fact that the Governor may in fact use them for an entirely collateral andpolitical purpose which has nothing to do with safety. If the Governor did take up such a position I think that the Chinese People&apos;s Government would be facedwith two alternatives assuming that the matter would not be solved by diplomaticrepresentations. They could either bring an action in the courts against theGovernor alleging that the detention was illegal or they could dismantle theaircraft and transport them to China by land.If they took the former course, the action could, I think, although here again the matter is one to be decided by reference to the law and procedure in operation in Hong Kong, be conducted so as to put the validity of the registrations in issue,and possibly to enable the Americans to set up a competing claim. I feel boundto say, however, that from a political point of view, it does not seem to me that action by the Governor on this pretext would be very plausible. The aircraft were originally registered in China, at the most their registration there wasonly suspended and it seems clear that at present it remains in force, they bearChinese markings, they are in the possession and control of the Chinese. I feel,therefore, that it might well be said that the Governor would be entitled (although not bound) to act on the Chinese registration and to allow the aircraft to fly ifthey complied with the various regulations on the basis of their nationality beingChinese. On the other hand, the Governor is, I think, although I cannot be quite sure, legally entitled to say that in view of the two registrations and of the factthat an airworthiness certificate only exists in relation to one of them, he is not satisfied that the Colonial Air Navigation Order will be compiled with, althoughit must be understood that the Governor might then be made the Defendant in an action in which it might eventually be held either that he did not possess the powerhe claimed or in which the validity of the registrations would be settled in favourof the Chinese. Moreover, it seems not improbable that if the Chinese were facedwith the detention of the aircraft under Article 60, they might proceed todismantle the aircraft and to transport them by land. There seems no power underArticle 60 to prevent this being done and it has not been suggested to me that theGovernor has any other executive powers on which he could rely, although thereare no doubt special emergency powers which could be brought into operation ifthis seemed expedient politically.Accordingly, I proceed to answer the questions put to ,me as follows: (1) I agree that the Governor is probably entitled to detain the aircraft underArticle 60 on the ground of the dual registration. His power so to dois not affected by the fact that there is a dispute as to ownership andthat the matter is under appeal to the courts. Although the validity of the registrations may depend upon ownership (as in this country)the Governors strict concern is with registration only. He has, as faras I know, no power to preserve the status quo as between rivalclaimants to property, whether aircraft or otherwise, and his action must be based on and limited to the powers arising under the ColonialAir Navigation Order.
(2) As appears from the answer to the previous question, the Governor^powers exist quite independently of the decision of the Supreme court and of the course which may be taken on appeal. The embargo that theGovernor can place upon the aircraft arises under the Colonial air navigation Order and although, in an indirect sense, the Governorsaction which would not in truth be taken for the real purposes of theOrder, might gain some political merit from the fact that the ownership of the aircraft was in dispute, that is really irrelevant to the legalbasis of the Governor &apos;s action.(3) The previous answers govern the answer to this question. If theGovernor is going to exercise his powers under Article 60 of theColonial Air Navigation Order, I think the only logical position for him to take up is that he must continue that exercise by preventing the aircraft from flying until by legal proceedings the validity of oneregistration or the other has been affirmatively established or it hasbeen decided that his exercise of the powers is invalid. Since theGovernor&apos;s legal powers cannot be related to the legal proceedings atpresent taking place, which will not in themselves determine the validity of the registration, it does not seem to me that the result ofthe appeal in that litigation should affect the continued exercise ofthe Governors powers. In exercising his power, the Governor should,I think, not refer to the pending litigation but should base himselfsimply on the question of the validity of the registrations and saythat until there had been a decision on this issue by the courts,.he was unable to decide which registrations were valid.(4) This question is again answered by the answers to those which precedeit. For the reasons I have already indicated, I do not think that thejurisdictional immunity of the Chinese Government from suit gives rise to any extra territorial protection in respect of their civil aircraftIt does not appear to be the intention of the Chicago Convention or theColonial Air Navigation Order that the Executive should be precluded from exercising its powers under the Order, consistently with theConvention, in the case where the civil aircraft involved belong toanother sovereign State. There may indeed be something in the point which is made in my instructions that if the Governor were to dis-continue action under Article 60 of the Colonial Air Navigation Orderin the event of the final decision of the Court being in favour ofjurisdictional immunity, this would imply that we were disclaimingour rights under the Chicago Convention and the Colonial air navigation Order to control civil aircraft in the possession or controlof foreign Governments. I feel that if action is to be taken underArticle 60 at all, it must be based on the validity of the registration and that until one registration or the other is established as valid,the action should be continued.I must say, however, that the expediency of operating Article 60 of theColonial Air Navigation Order in these circumstances where no question of safety in the air is concerned is a matter of policy for decision by the Cabinet.The extent of the Governor&apos;s powers under that Order in the present circum-stances is not only legally uncertain, but their exercise would, I think, not be particularly convincing from a political point of view nor does it seem in anyway certain that their exercise would in the end secure the desired result sincethe Chinese might proceed to remove the aircraft over land. I regret that i cannot offer any general observations upon this most difficult problem beyondsaying that it should be pointed out to the Americans, as no doubt it already has,that unless the Executive take special statutory powers, which presumably it isthought inexpedient to do, they can do no more than operate the existing law which in Hong Kong, as in America, does not in general entitle the executive to intervene between one claimant or another in order to preserve a status cjuobut leaves the claimants to such action as they may be advised and be able to take&apos;under the ordinary rules of law currently in force.,    -. - I have, .&amp;c.(Signed) HARTLEY SHAWCROSS-Law Officers&apos; Department,3rd April, 1950.
