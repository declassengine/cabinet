In CP. (49) 182 I circulated an account of the 32nd Session of the Inter-national Labour Conference, held at Geneva from June to July, 1949. The present paper contains my proposals for action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regardto certain of the Conventions and Recommendations adopted at that Conference.Proposals for action by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the remaining instrumentsadopted by the Conference will be made as soon as possible. The texts of the conventions and Recommendations were published in Cmd. 7852.Convention (No. 94) concerning Labour Clauses in Public ContractsRecommendation (No. 84) concerning Labour Clauses in Public Contracts2. The Convention, which relates to contracts awarded by a central authorityof the Government, provides that public contracts shall include clauses ensuring that the wages (including allowances), hours of work and other conditions oflabour of the workers employed shall not be less favourable than those establishedby collective agreement, arbitration award or national laws or regulations forwork of the same character in the trade or industry concerned in the district in-which the work is carried on. Where the conditions of labour are not so regulatedin the district where the work is carried on, the workers are to receive conditionsno less favourable than those established by these means in the nearest appropriatedistrict or the general level observed in the trade or industry by employers whosegeneral circumstances are similar to those of the contractor concerned. The pro-visions of the Fair Wages Resolution, 1946, of the House of Commons are in accord with the terms of the Convention.I propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify this Convention.3. The Recommendation consists of two paragraphs only, the first of which provides for the application to cases where private employers are granted subsidiesor are licensed to operate a public utility of provisions similar to those of theConvention. The law and practice of the United Kingdom are substantially in accord with the provisions of this paragraph, which can be accepted as embodyinga generally desirable principle. Paragraph 2 of the Recommendation providesthat the labour clauses of a public contract should prescribe either directly or by reference to provisions contained in national laws or regulations, collective agree-ments, arbitration awards or other recognised arrangements, the normal andovertime rates of wages to be paid to the various categories of workers concerned,the manner in which hours of work are to be regulated, and holiday and sick leaveprovisions.

annex draft White PaperInternational Labour ConferenceThere are set out below the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government on certain of the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at its 32nd Session in 1949, which it is proposed to communicate tothe Director-General of the International Labour Office. The French and Englishtexts of these Conventions and Recommendations were presented to parliament in Cmd. 7852.Convention (No. 94) concerning Labour Clauses in Public ContractsRecommendation (No. 84) concerning Labour Clauses in Public Contracts1. The Convention, which relates to contracts awarded by a central authorityof the Government, provides that public contracts shall include clauses ensuring that the wages (including allowances), hours of work and other conditions oflabour of the workers employed shall not be less favourable than those establishedby collective agreement, arbitration award or national laws or regulations forwork of the same character in the trade or industry concerned in the districtin which the work is carried on. Where the conditions of labour are not soregulated in the district where the work is carried on the workers are to receiveconditions no less favourable than those established by these means in the nearestappropriate district or the general level observed in the trade or industry by not covered by collective agreement, it would not be regarded as appropriate toprovide directly for them in the clauses of a public contract.I propose that His Majesty?s Government should indicate their general acceptance of this Recommendation with a reservation as regards paragraph 2.Convention (No. 98) Concerning the Application of the Principles of the Rightj..   ,j to Organise and Bargain Collectively &apos;  1   &apos;4. The Convention supplements the Convention on Freedom of association and Protection of the Right to Organise (No. 87) which was adopted by theInternational Labour Conference at its 31st Session in 1948. In accordance withthe Cabinets decision of 2nd May, 1949 (CM. (49) 31st Conclusions, Minute 6),the latter Convention has been ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect ofGreat Britain. The new Convention sets out certain principles designed to protectworkers against anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and toprovide other guarantees with the object of protecting the right to organise intotrades unions and employers&apos; organisations. It further provides for encouragingand promoting the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntarynegotiation. These principles are. applied in the United Kingdom, and, unlike the earlier Convention, ratification need not be limited to Great Britain.I propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify this Convention.Recommendation (No. 87) concerning Vocational Guidance5. The Recommendation sets out certain principles on which vocational guidance for young persons and adults should be based and the methods by whichthey should be applied. These principles and methods are acceptable as a basis for development in the United Kingdom.I propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept this Recommendation.Issue of White paper. On the basis of the above proposals, I seek authority for the issue of a white Paper in the terms of the annexed draft setting out the Government^decisions in regard to these Conventions and Recommendations.G.
