Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950SECRETCP. (SO) 78Wh April, 1950Copy No.CABINETTHE ARAB STATES AND ISRAELMemorandum by the Foreign SecretaryIntroductoryIt has been our constant desire to promote not merely peace but friendly relations between Israel and the Arab States, with the object of contributingtowards the stability and prosperity of the Middle East.2. In CP. (49) 10 of 15th January, 1949, I stated that efforts were already being made behind the scenes to encourage the Arab States principally concerned to negotiate with Israel, but that no major initiative on our part would probablybe required if the discussions then being carried on continued and were eventuallytaken over by the Conciliation Commission.3. During the period which has elapsed since that paper was prepared, some progress has been made towards a settlement in Palestine. The principal develop-ments that have taken place are described in the appendix to this memorandum.The Conciliation Commission has, however, been unable to make much progress towards an actual settlement. Particularly, the problems of territorialagreements, Arab refugees and Jerusalem are still unsolved.4. The only Arab ruler who has so far shown realism and willingness tocome to terms with Israel is King Abdullah of Jordan. For this, however, he was severely criticised at a recent meeting of the Arab League Council, which finallypassed a resolution (in which his representative acquiesced) to the effect that anymember of the League signing a separate peace with Israel would be expelledand liable to sanctions.5. Meanwhile the Law Officers have confirmed the opinion of the ForeignOffice Legal Adviser, of which I informed the Defence Committee on 15th March(D.O. (50) 4th Meeting, Minute 6), that the Anglo-Jordan and Anglo-EgyptianTreaties have, since the signature of the armistice agreements between Israel andJordan and Egypt, applied automatically to the portions of Arab Palestine nowin the occupation and control of Jordan and Egypt respectively. We have so farrefrained from informing or admitting to the Governments concerned that this conclusion has been reached, though Jordan has independently reached a similarconclusion.6. I consider that the time has now come when an effort should be madeboth to encourage King Abdullah to continue in the attitude which he has hithertoadopted, to make a contribution towards the stability of the area, and at thesame time to make a gesture towards Israel. The measures which I proposeare described below.Union of Jordan and Arab Palestine7. Elections in Jordan and the part of Arab Palestine controlled by Jordanfor a new Assembly to represent both countries have recently been held, and theAssembly is expected to meet on or about 24th April. According to present information, the new Assembly is likely to vote a &apos;&apos; union &apos;&apos; between the Kingdomof Jordan and the part of Arab Palestine controlled by Jordan, despite the fact38596
that the Arab League Council at its recent meeting passed a resolution declaringArab Palestine to be a &quot; trust territory.&quot; to be held by the occupying Arab Powersuntil a final settlement and then handed back to its inhabitants to determinetheir own future status.8. The incorporation of this part of Arab Palestine in Jordan is undoubtedly the only logical solution and the one best calculated to ensure the welfare of itsinhabitants.9. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Minister to Israel has advised that the union with Jordan of those parts of Arab Palestine which Jordan now administerswhere a large proportion of the Arab refugees are now concentrated, togetherwith the knowledge that the Anglo-Jordan Treaty applies to that territory, wouldbe an important contribution towards the stability of that area. He considersthat it would strengthen the Israel Government against expansionist oppositiongroups, and encourage them to seek a settlement with Jordan on the basis of thepresent provisional frontier. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Amman andJerusalem have similarly urged the advantages of the incorporation of ArabPalestine in Jordan.10. For the above reasons, I am of the opinion that the Jordan Governmentshould be encouraged to proclaim the union of Arab Palestine with Jordan asthey have hitherto intended to do, and that if and when this union is proclaimed,His Majesty&apos;s Government should recognise it and announce that in their view the Anglo-Jordan Treaty automatically applies to that part of Arab Palestinenow united with Jordan.11. In making such an announcement, it would be necessary to make tworeservations : (1) in regard to the portion of Jerusalem at present occupied by Jordan,since this forms part of the area which, under the terms of the united nations Assembly resolution of 9th December, 1949, was scheduledfor internationalisation;(2) in regard to the frontier between Arab Palestine and Israel, which wasprovisionally laid down under the armistice agreement signed betweenthe two countries on 3rd April, 1949, but which, pending a final settlement between them, is subject to modification by free negotiation.This reservation could be to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s government regard the territory of Jordan to which the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of1948 is applicable as being bounded by the armistice line laid downin the Armistice Agreement signed between Israel and Jordan on 3rd April, 1949, or any modification thereof which shall be agreed upon by the two States under the terms of that Agreement, until such time as the frontier between Israel and Jordan is determined by afinal settlement between them.12. I should also wish to take this opportunity of stating that we have no intention of establishing British military bases in peace-time in the portion of arab Palestine now to be united to Jordan. The Israel Government, who attach importance to this point, were informed in this sense in December 1949, but have asked for the fact to be made public for reasons of internal politics. The jordan government axe already aware of the position.De Jure Recognition of Israel13. I have for some time past been considering de jure recognition of theState of Israel. I am of the opinion that a recognition of the union of ArabPalestine with Jordan might be a suitable moment to announce this.14. Be jure recognition of Israel would require to be accompanied byreservations similar to those indicated in paragraph 11 above, in regard to (1) The portion of Jerusalem at present occupied by Israel and forming partof the area scheduled under the Assembly resolution for inter-nationalisation ; and(2) IsraePs frontiers with her Arab neighbours, which have been provision-ally laid down under the armistice agreement signed with the foulArab countries concerned and all of which are subject to modificationby free negotiation.
The latter reservation would be in the form indicated in paragraph 11 (2) abovemutatis mutandis. It would be particularly important in the case of the frontier between Israel and Egypt. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo has pointedout that the Egyptians still attach great store to rectifying their frontier withIsrael in the Negev, in view of the fact that Israel occupied this area in the winter of 1948-49, subsequent to the cease-fire ordered in the Security Council resolution of 18th July, 1948. He has suggested that de jure recognition of Israel by theUnited Kingdom, by seeming to endorse these Israeli acquisitions of territory,might be badly received in Egypt. I consider that reservation (2) above should suffice to meet this point.15. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo has also suggested that de jure recognition might stiffen the attitude of the Israel Government in regard to futurenegotiations with Egypt. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Ammanhas pointed out that the present Israel attitude renders the chances of successfulIsrael-Egypt negotiations remote, and that, for many cogent reasons, a settlement between Israel and Jordan should not be delayed.16. I am of the opinion that the balance of advantage lies in proceeding asproposed.General Statement of Policy in the Middle East17. Finally, these two acts of recognition by His Majesty&apos;s government might afford a suitable occasion to reaffirm that our policy in the Middle Eastaims at the establishment of peace and security in that areas and in particulara settlement between Israel and the Arab States; and that we are determined touse all our influence both within and outside the United Nations to prevent theuse of force or threat of force by any State in the Middle East against any othersuch State, in a manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.The United States Government have already made a statement on these general lines.Recommendation18. To sum up, the action which I propose, and to which I ask my colleagues to agree, is as follows :  (1) If and when a union of Arab Palestine with Jordan is proclaimed byKing Abdullah, to announce His Majesty&apos;s Governments recognitionof this union and their view that the provisions of the Anglo-jordan treaty apply to the areas united to Jordan, with reservations asregards the frontier between Arab Palestine and Israel and as regardsJerusalem, and a reference to our intention not to establish bases inthese areas.(2) Simultaneously to  announce  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments  de  jure recognition of Israel, with similar provisos in regard to Jerusalem andthe frontiers of Israel with her Arab neighbours.(3) To make a statement reaffirming His Majesty&apos;s Governments desire for peace in the Middle East and their opposition to the use of forcebetween Middle Eastern States.E.
