(50) 812Mh April, 1950CABINETTENTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL OFTHE UNITED NATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report on the tenth sessionof the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, which was held atLake Success from 7th February to 6th March, 1950.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,26th April, 1950.REPORT ON THE TENTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC and social COUNCIL-NEW YORK, 7th FEBRUARY-6th MARCH, 1950The tenth session of the Economic and Social Council had little difficulty indisposing of its agenda in four weeks. The small United Kingdom delegation was led by Sir Terence Shone of the permanent Delegation in New York,assisted by Sir Sydney Caine of the Treasury Delegation at Washington for theeconomic items.2. Following their now well-established practice, the Soviet, Polish andCzechoslovak representatives at the beginning of the session proposed the exclu-sion of the Kuomintang Chinese representative, and, when this proposal was rejected, refused to take any further part in the session. Their absence enabled the Council to dispose quickly of a number of items which would normallyhave been the subject of intense controversy, such as the International LabourOrganisation^ proposals for making available to the United Nations theservices of their Commission of Inquiry into Infringements of Trade UnionRights. At the same time the remaining delegates felt able to speak with greater candour on a number of items. The councils agenda, however,was not of such a kind as to afford any real test of its possibilities whenunhindered by the presence of the Slav representatives.3. The following are some of the more important features of the session : Full Employment4. Potentially the most important subject before the Council was the reportpublished in January by a group of experts appointed by the Secretary-general on national and international measures that might be taken to promote full em-ployment, a summary of which was circulated to the Economic Policy committee as E.P.C. (50) 22. There was general agreement that it was much too early forGovernments to take a definite stand on the far-reaching recommendations con-tained in this report and, after the majority of Delegates had welcomed the38627
experts&apos; work, while expressing doubts about the over rigid nature of some of their recommendations, the Council unanimously adopted a resolution asking Govern-ments to study the report and to come to the next session of the Council in Julyprepared to state their attitude towards its recommendations. It was fairlygenerally agreed that if Governments could not accept the experts&apos; proposals theyshould come forward with some of their own.Other Economic items. Closely related to the CounciTs debate on full employment were its dis-cussions of the world economic situation and of methods of financing economic development. Indeed the majority of speakers emphasised the degree of inter-connexion between such problems as the maintenance of full employment, the achievement of the convertibility of currencies, and the encouragement of foreigninvestments in under-developed countries, and much stress was laid on the import-ance of the economic development of such countries, not only to themselves, butalso to the maintenance of economic stability in the industrial countries by pro-viding an expanding market for their goods. The Secretariat^ report on&quot; Major Economic Changes in 1949 &quot; was criticised as over-pessimistic, in par-ticular by the United States Delegate, who claimed that there were, no signs ofa cyclical downturn. In the debate on methods of financing development, theUnited States Delegate again answered the under-developed countries&apos; appealsfor governmental loans by declaring that at the moment the main problem was how to utilise the existing unused resources of such institutions as theInternational Bank.Economic Survey of Africa6. The United Kingdom Delegation, working in close collaboration with theFrench, Belgian and United States Delegations, were able to secure the defeat ofan Indian proposal for a special economic survey of Africa by the united nations which arose out of a request made by the World Federation of the united nations Associations that the Council should study the desirability of setting upa regional economic commission for Africa.Non-Governmental Organisations7. The Council reviewed its consultative arrangements with non-govern-mental organisations and decided on certain changes. In particular, in view ofthe abuse by a number of such organisations with Category A status (i.e., the rightto send observers to meetings of the Council), especially the World Federation ofTrade Unions, of the prescriptive right they had received in 1946 to place items onthe Council&apos;s provisional agenda, it was agreed to subject such items in future tothe scrutiny and approval of the Council&apos;s Non-Governmental Organisations Com-mittee.8. The Council unanimously admitted the International Confederation of free Trade Unions to Category A status, while on the other hand a particularlyscurrilous document circulated by the World Federation of Trade Unions led theIndian Delegate to threaten that if that Organisation did not mend its ways itmight find itself deprived of its present status.Forced Labour9. In the absence of the Soviet and other Communist representatives therewas general agreement that the Council should postpone any decision what shouldbe done on the problem of forced labour, and a resolution was passed postponingfurther consideration of this question until the Council&apos;s twelfth session nextyear.Foreign Office, S.
