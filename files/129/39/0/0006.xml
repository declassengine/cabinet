NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE(ENGLAND AND WALES)&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in O.P.(50) 53,proposes an announcement in the budget speech, and the intro-cluction of legislation, to the effect that some  1+2 millionsinitially - and larger sums later - will in future be recovered directly from patients using the National health service, in the form of charges for its use.2* I agree with him that we are bound to be faced withfuture demands for extensions and developments in the Service,and I certainly agree that it would be politically unrealistic to think that all such demands can be uniformly refused.      ButI think it would be even more politically unrealistic, in thepresent Parliament in particular, to make&apos; the proposed announce-ment.3. Also,  I do not think we need assume that all exten-sions and developments of the Service must necessarily involveincreases in maintenance costs.      Some, at any rate, might wellbe of a kind to improve future economic running.      For others,wo shall have to examine the need for them against the generalnational situation and the parallel needs in other fields, and where they clearly must go on we shall have to concentrate onoff-setting their cost by tighter administration and, wherever possible, by savings in other parts of the Service.       In this regard, we must keep clearly in our minds that the presenthospital service is prejudiced, as compared with its predecessors-cessor services under local authorities or voluntary organisa-tions, by having always to include the annual cost of capitalworks &quot;above the line&quot; and bj, not being able to finance them byloan.      It has,  in my view, produced, a misleading picture to load the full weight of this on the ordinary hospital estimates,at least in these initial years of the new service.k- I am, as the Chancellor says, considering with thehospital authorities the methods by which closer central controlcan in future be exercised in their part of the service, and Ihave also under review certain other possible economies in the health services generally.      I hope to be reporting to mycolleagues on all this very soon, and in time for something tobe included on the subject in the budget speech.      But, mean-while,  I suggest it would be, to say the very least, tacticallyunwise to commit the Government to such a drastic and unpopularalteration in the whole structure of the Health Service as theproposed recovery of charges would involve.5. Nor do I believe that the economic yield of the various kinds of charges which might be imposed would be likely to be assubstantial,  or as simply effected,  as may at first sight appear.We had a good example of that, as soon as the shilling charge onprescriptions was closely investigated.      There would be similar,or other,  difficulties in&apos; other fields.COPY NO.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret P. (50) 56.50TH MARCH,  1950CABINET

6. In the hospitals, for example,, if we tried to recovera maintenance or &quot;hotel&quot; charge from patients for their keep, weshould at once be charging some people who would not have hadto pay,  in some of the hospitals, even in the days before theNational Health Service started.      Also we should immediatelyrun into collision with, the present practice of the Minister ofNational Insurance of withholding part of cash benefit - e. g.   of sickness benefit or pension - from recipients who are in hospital.      If the recipient was already being charged by thehospital, any reduction of his cash benefit or pension would haveto stop or be adjusted;    the result, broadly, would be that apart from the shorter stay cases there would be a loss on theNational Insurance vote to set off against any saving on the health Service-vote.      Without allowing for this set-off, an earlier rough estimate showed that a charge of 10/- a week forevery in-patient might yield some  10 millions a year in Englandand Wales.      After allowing for the set-off, it is obvious that even with this hospital charge imposed universally we should still have to look elsewhere for substantially more than  52millions in other charges at the outset, and more later.7- Looking elsewhere would mean looking at, say, thechemists&apos;, dentists&apos; and opticians&apos; services.      In England andWales the figures next year for these are about  26 millions forthe chemists,  39&apos;2r millions for the dentists and  2h4&quot; millions for the eye service,  a total of some  90 millions,,      We shouldbe looking, in fact, at the possibility of recovering about a third of their total cost in direct charges to the patients.S. That is the broad kind of situation we should befacing on the proposed announcement.     But,  as important as auy-thing in it, we should have also to face a new consequencealtogether in some provision for the money needs of those who could not pay the charges.      The National Assistance Board isprecluded by statute from assisting people to meet any &quot;medical,surgical, optical, aural or dental&quot; requirements.      Either they&apos;would have to be enabled to do so (and on the present generousscales on which they assess needs, a good bit of our yield fromcharges would be offset) or some elaborate new machinery wouldhave to be devised to pick up, assess and deal with all&quot;hardshipcases some other way.      Either way, apart from the administra-tive complexities and costs of this, we should be back once again with the means test in the Health Service.9.- I have purposely not gone into details in this paper,because it is on the basic -principle  raised by this proposedalteration of the Health Service that I think we must firstdecide.      The alteration is not only in itself undesirable, inmy view, but it would bo in any case  a fundamental political andtactical mistake.      If my colleagues agree with me in this,  i suggest that the next step is for me to prepare for our early consideration an assessment of what steps might now be taken to tighten control of hospital and other expenditure, and of whatconsequences may flow from taking them, on the original basis ofthe Chancellor&apos;s announcement during the recent debate on the supplementary Estimates.10. This &quot;paper deals only with England and Wales.       Iunderstand that the Secretary of State for Scotland is submittinga separate paper on the Health Service in Scotland.A.
