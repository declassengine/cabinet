HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret the situation in the London docks has only slightly -deteriorated since the matter of the dock strike was last considered by the Cabinet.    There are said to be signs ofa desire on the part of some of the men on strike to returnto work, and. it has been represented from several quartersthat a considerable number would return to work but areunable to.de so as long as Service-men are employed in the docks.2.      The London Dock Labour Board have today been consideringthe position of the men on strike and they were originally ofopinion that the Service-men should be withheld from the docks on Friday morning next until 9 a.m. to give the men anopportunity to return to work.    The employers thought thatthese arrangements should be coupled with a -pronouncementthat those who did not return to work by Friday morning-would be regarded as be&amp;ng dismissed from the Scheme.Subsequently, as there was not Unanimity on the London Board,it was decided to refer the matter to the National Dock labour board for advice.    This decision was communicated to the ministerial Committee this evening and the London Dock labour board were informed by direction of the Committee that theGovernment would not be in a position to form a view orcomment on the decision until Thursday afternoon.    TheNational Dock Labour Board intend to meet on Thursday at.30 p.m. and the London Dock Labour Board feel that it is imperative that they should be informed of the Government&apos;views by 1 p.m.3.     There is little doubt that if the matter goes to theNational Dock Labour Board, they will advise the dismissal ofthe strikers on the linos proposed by the employers&apos;  side ofthe London Dock Labour Board.h.     The view of the Ministerial Committee is that it wouldbe unwise to make any gesture by offering to withhold thetroops until it becomes much clearer that there is a general desire on the part of the men to return to work.    It would be preferable if the Union    could give some guarantee of returnand if the request&apos;for the temporary withdrawal of the Service-men came from the Union.    While the Service forces are being26TH APRIL,   1950COPYCABINETTHE LONDON DOCK strike memorandum by the Home Secretary

built up and before the dockers realise that the docks will bworked without their help; it night be taken as a sign of weato make a general withdrawal of the Service-men eventemporarily0    The Minister of Labour, however&quot;, expressed theview that there might be advantage In withdrawing the troopstemporarily on Friday morning of this week to give the mena chance to return under pain of dismissal if they refusedto do so,5.      On the other hand,  the Ministerial Committee felt thatas long as there was a chance of an early return to work it would be ill advised to make any threats of dismissalwhich might discourage this tendency.6.     The Ministerial Committee are of the opinion that the build-up of the troops should go on as rapidly as possible.The question arises whether any action should be taken toprevent the request for advice from being preferred by theLondon Dock Labour Board to the National Dock labour Beard,and, if this failed, whether any approach should be made tothe National Dock Labour Board.    Either course is attendedwith considerable difficulty.J, C,E,Home Office, S.W.1.26TH APRIL,  1950.
