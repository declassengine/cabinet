iPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1950SECEET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 8326th April, 1950CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT  COMMISSION: LONDON  AREA  (INTERIM)PASSENGER CHARGES scheme memorandum by the Minister of Transport(1) Section 76 of the Transport Act, 1947, imposes upon the British transport commission the duty to prepare and submit to the Transport Tribunal (the former-Railway Rates Tribunal renamed by the Act) draft charges schemes for deter-mining the charges to be made for the services and facilities which the Commissionprovide.It is the duty of the Tribunal under the Act to confirm such schemes with or without alteration or to reject them after hearing objections or other represen-tations made by bodies representing users or other providers of transport.(2) The draft scheme, summarised in Appendix A, which deals with passengercharges for the Commission^ services in the London Area is the first to be sub-mitted to the Tribunal in accordance with these provisions. The commission have asked the Tribunal to confirm it and to specify 1st October, 1950, as thedate on which it should come into force.(3) The Tribunal gave public notice of the scheme and of the time withinwhich and the manner in which objections or other representations should belodged by bodies representing users or other providers of transport. Objections,totalling 107, were lodged by the following : (a) 9 local authorities, including the County Councils of London, Essex,Middlesex and Surrey, and the Common Council of the City of London:(b) the Trades Union Congress and 25 Trade Unions and branches of TradeUnions;(c) 17 Trades Councils;(d) 9 Shop Stewards&apos; Committees;(e) 6 Passenger Organisations, including the Traffic Advisory Committees of north-West Kent and South Essex and the London Passengers&apos; Asso-ciation;(/) 24 Ratepayers&apos; and Residents&apos; Associations;(g) 3 student bodies;(k) 13 political organisations, including the London Labour Party, theSutton and Cheam Division and the West Ham South Division of theLabour Party, the Heston and Isleworth Conservative Association and branches of the Communist Party.The Tribunal will commence the public inquiry into the scheme on Tuesday,9th May.(4) I have a right to be heard in any proceedings before the Tribunal, andI accordingly sent copies of the draft scheme to other Government Departmentsinterested for their observations.   A summary of points raised is in Appendix B.38631 b
The question for decision is whether I should make any and if so what represen-tations to the Tribunal. It should be emphasised that they are a judicial body and are in no way bound to accept any representations which I may make to them.The Transport Bill as originally drafted provided for submission to me bythe Commission of the principles which should govern their charges, for referenceto any Advisory Committee, for settlement by me after considering the advice ofthis Committee, and for submission to Parliament for approval. This procedure was not accepted by my colleagues (CM. (46) 96th Conclusions, Minute 4, andS.I. (M) (46) 14th Meeting), and the procedure embodied in the Act was accordinglysubstituted.Having regard to this decision and to the basis on which charging provisionsof the Act proceeded through Parliament, I feel that I should not intervene in theTribunahs proceedings except to the extent that it may be necessary for me tomake representations in regard to charges for Government traffic, i.e., charges which fall to be met by Departments as users of transport. The only exception\ I would make to this proposition is that it is conceivable that I might have to make representations on some matter which I thought the Tribunal ought to take intoconsideration and which might not otherwise be brought to their notice.(5) If this principle be accepted I should not intervene in regard to general issues such as the modification of workmen&apos;s fares or the age limit for generaltravel at half fare. In any case, intervention by me in such matters would giverise to considerable difficulties. For example, the Minister of Labour considersthat workmen&apos;s fares should be continued in their present form. A strong ease,with which I personally agree, can be made for regarding workmen&apos;s fares as suchas an anachronism. Their retention in London would practically wreck the Corn-mission^ proposals. Apart from this, however, if I appeared before the Tribunalas an advocate of the view of the Minister of Labour I should be publicly opposing the Commission. If I advocated the contrary view I should be publicly opposing the T.U.C and many Government supporters. In either case a most embarrassing position would be likely to result if the Tribunal did not accept the view which put forward and which would, of course, be regarded as representing government policy. I therefore feel strongly that the right course is to leave the impartialTribunal to settle these issues after hearing the arguments of the Commissionand those who appear in opposition. It is clear from the scope of the oppositionthat no main issue is likely to go by default.(6) There remains the effect of the draft scheme upon the Government asusers of the Commission^ services. The only issue involved in this scheme is thebasis of the special rail fares for Service and police personnel.(7) Cheap fares for such personnel travelling on duty had their origin in theCheap Trains Act, 1883, which provided that the single journey fare should be three-quarters of the ordinary single fare where the number to be conveyed was less than 150, and that where parties numbered more than 150 the excess beyond that number should be charged at half the ordinary single fare. In 1934, when there was severe road competition for military, &amp;c, traffic, negotiations were con-ducted with the three Service Departments with the object of regaining and retain-ing Service personnel to rail.&apos; The outcome of these negotiations was that, in con-sideration of an undertaking given to the former railway companies that rail transport would always be used unless this would clearly entail serious delay orother marked inconvenience, further reduced fares were agreed, both in respectof travel on duty or leave at Government expense and travel by personnel or their dependants at their own expense. The basis then agreed is in operation to-day(subject to the authorised general increases) and is half single fare for a singlejourney and single fare for a return journey, regardless of numbers or whetherthe fare is paid by the Government or by the individual travelling.(8) The Commission inform me that, in the opinion of their Solicitors, theprovisions of the Cheap Trains Act relating to special fares for Governmentpersonnel are not overridden by the draft scheme and that they have no intentionunder the scheme of seeking an alteration of the principles which govern the calculation of fares for (a) personnel travelling on duty or on leave at Governmentexpense, or (b) Service personnel travelling on leave at their own expense. Asregards the question of the Government Departments negotiating special arrange-ments for road travel by the Commission^ services, there is no intention of making any change in the present arrangements, but the Commission continue to rely uponthe undertaking referred to paragraph (7).
(9) The Commission point out, however, that this is an interim scheme andthat what is said in paragraph (8) applies only to this scheme and must not beregarded as necessarily applicable to a national passenger charges scheme, whenthe time comes for that to be put forward.(10) In the circumstances I propose, if my colleagues agree, to appear uponthe proceedings before the Tribunal but not to intervene unless any special point should arise in connection with charges for Government traffic.A. B.Ministry of Transport,26th April 1950.APPENDIX a london Area (Interim) Passenger Charges scheme. The scheme covers all services of London Transport, together with thesuburban services of British Railways within the area served by London Transportbuses, and also embraces the whole of the London, Tilbury and Southend Line.2. The scheme is described as an interim scheme because it may require some modification when charges schemes for the whole country are settled later.3. The existing different levels of fares result in many inequitable anomalies.For example, the fares and season ticket rates on British Railways are generallyhigher than those on London Transport, and there are also marked inequalitiesof charge as between different services of London Transport, of which the mostnotable is the application of low workmen&apos;s fares to underground railways, tramsand trolley-buses, but not at all to ordinary buses.4. The main objects of the scheme are to establish as far as possible equality of fares for journeys of similar length and for those between common pointsby alternative routes; and in particular to remove the differences of charge whichat present discourage people from using the most convenient means of transport for their journeys. To secure a new common level, those charges which are relatively high will be reduced, and those which are relatively low will be increased.5. An important feature of the scheme is the replacement of the workmen&apos;sfares which are at present limited to rail, tram and trolley-bus, by a system of cheap early morning fares available on all forms of transport, except the GreenLine coaches. This will mean a substantial new concession to early morningpassengers over all the extensive bus system of London Transport for distancesbeyond one mile. These new early morning fares will generally be higher thanthe present workmen&apos;s fares, but in most cases lower than the present ordinaryfares and in all cases lower than the proposed new ordinary fares.6. The estimated net effect of the lowering and raising of fares involved inthe scheme is to increase the gross receipts from passenger services in the london area in a full year from about  74J million to about  77f million.7. The proposals provide for maximum charges (subject to certain percentagelimitations) as follows: Fares for single and return journeys (other than early morning fares)On British Railways, fares to correspond with London Transport ordinaryfares will take the form of day return fares at \\d. per mile available by all trainsfrom all stations. For return journeys completed on one day these l\d. per milefares will supersede monthly return fares at 1 - 63e . per mile, and accordingly will represent a substantial reduction. The introduction of the new day return fareswill largely render redundant the existing cheap day return fares on british railways, which are subject to time restrictions and limited to selected pairs of stations, and these will therefore be withdrawn.The existing monthly return fares (1 - 63d. per mile) and ordinary singlefares (2-44c . per mile) on British Railways in the London Area will generallyremain in operation in respect of journeys extending beyond the London Area,38631 b 2
which are not affected by the present scheme. This consideration does not arise,however, on the London, Tilbury and Southend Line, on which passengers, will getthe benefit of the l^d: per mile basis for all single journeys, and not only for dayreturn journeys.London Transport ordinary fares (rail and road) will be revised to a basisof approximately l\d. per mile. The existing \\d. minimum fare for about one mile remains; 2^d. fares&quot;for 2 miles go up to 3d.; 4d: and 5d. fares for and 4 miles remain; above that, fares will be increased as required to thel^d. per mile scale.   Transfer fares (mainly confined to trams) will cease.London Transport coach fares will be reduced from their present basis of1 -55d. per mile to the new l\d. per mile standard.Season Ticket RatesA common standard scale for season ticket rates on London Transport rail-ways and British Railways will be adopted. The new standard is 9 to 14 per cent,below the present standard of British Railways for the material distances and5 to 12 per cent, above the present standard of London Transport. Most british railways season ticket rates will therefore be reduced, but some are so much belowstandard that, despite the adoption of a lower standard scale, they will be subjectto increase.Workmen&apos;s and- early morning, faresFor the first time an early morning fare concession will apply on all Londonbuses. Workmen&apos;s return fares now vary and are of limited application. A new system of early morning fares will replace them, and on all: forms of transport,except coaches, will be available to all passengers travelling over a mile andcompleting journeys before 8 a,m. (or starting before 7-30 a.m. on london transport railways). The level of charge proposed for the new early morningfares is higher than present workmen&apos;s fares, except for the first 8 miles,on, british railways. But the new early morning fares will be lower than the new l^d. permile scale for London Transport ordinary fares and British Railways day returnfares, and the reductions on these will range from Id. a day for 2-niile journeysto 10d. a day for lOrmile journeys. The present shift workers&apos; facility will cease,the Commission stating that they see no justification for the differential treatmentof different sections of the community travelling at the same time which would be involved in the continuation of any system of shift workmen&apos;s tickets.On the railways the early morning fare will be by way of a return fare asat present. On the road services, there will be a low early mqrning single farefor the outward j ourney, and; passengers will pay the ordinary single fare for the journey back. The cost of the double journey will he the same by rail or roadup to distances of&apos; 10 miles,,APPENDIX BLondon. Area (Interim) Passenger Charges SchemeComments by other Government departments the following Departments were asked for their observations on the draft scheme : -Ministry of Town and Country Planning, Home Office, Ministry ofDefence, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education,Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Ministry of Pensions.Their replies may be summarised as follows : (a) The proposed abolition of workmen&apos;s fares as suchThe Ministry of Labour state that, as the Government&apos;s attitude to wage increases has been that they should be avoided, even where they could be justifiedin order to remove anomalies in the wage structure, they consider that it will&quot; embarrass the Government &quot;if alterations are made in a fare structure in orderto remove anomalies when these alterations will, in fact, mean a &quot; quite substan-tial&quot; increase in workers&apos; weekly travelling costs. They, foresee demands forincreased wages as a consequence and say that it will be impossible for the Govern-ment to maintain their policy in other fields if it is not maintained in connection
with workmen&apos;s fares. They take the view that representations should be madeto the Tribunal against any alteration at the present time in the workmen&apos;s faresin general and in the arrangements for the issue of shift workmen&apos;s tickets outsidethe normal hours.The Service Departments, in their capacity as employers of labour, express the same views.(b) The abolition of special fares for Service and Police personnel travelling onI   duty .. :On behalf of the Ministry of Defence and the three Service Departments, theWar Office state that they are not prepared to surrender any statutory rights which they hold under the Cheap Trains Act. Neither are they prepared to relinquish easily any of their present privileges in regard to concession fares by rail. They have examined the draft of the scheme in an endeavour to discoverhow they stand in these matters, but put the final onus upon the Ministry ofTransport to take whatever steps may be necessary to preserve their presentprivileges if not satisfied that the position can be maintained under the scheme as drafted.They also wish to be sure of retaining latitude to negotiate special terms forroad travel by B.T.C. services.The Home Office wish to maintain for the police the parity with the armed forces recognised in the Cheap Trains Act.(c) The age limit for half fare for children the Ministry of Education consider that in connection with the scheme the raising of the age limit for general half fare travel to 15 years should be conceded in principle, even if the present financial situation of the B.T.C. makes it necessaryto defer concession in practice.They wish to be reassured as to the continuance of the cheap fares for parties of children on day or period excursions. They want the present half fare arrange-ments for journey to and from school for children up to the age of 18 yearsextended to cover coach services, in addition to rail and ordinary road services asat present, and ask whether, if there is difficulty in doing this generally, it wouldbe possible to provide concessions to children travelling against the main streamof traffic.The Ministries of Town and Country Planning, Health and Pensions haveno observations to make on the draft scheme.
