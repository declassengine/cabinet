Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950SECRETCP. (50) 68nth April, 1950CABINETFOREIGN VISITING forces memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Ministerof Defence, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of state . In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 3rd April (CM. (50)17th Conclusions, Minute 2), we submit this further memorandum with regardto the proposals set out in CP. (50) 42 about privileges to foreign visiting forces.2. The effect of the measures at present governing the position of the UnitedStates forces in this country is that the United States authorities exerciseexclusive criminal jurisdiction, with the proviso that it is open to them to waivejurisdiction. A case in which jurisdiction was waived was that of R. v. Hultenand Jones. Hulten was an American serviceman and Jones a British subject.They were jointly charged before our courts with the murder of a private hirecar driver.   Both were convicted, in January 1945, and Hulten was executed.Commonwealth visiting forces and allied visiting forces (other thanAmerican) have a criminal jurisdiction concurrent with that of the ordinarycourts of the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, they exercise the same juris-diction as our own army and air force courts martial: our army and air force courts martial have jurisdiction concurrent with the ordinary courts to try alloffences other than murder, manslaughter, treason, treason felony and rape. Itwas agreed that the courts martial of the Commonwealth and allied visiting forces should not deal with these excepted offences but should leave them to ordinary courts of the United Kingdom.Detailed instructions were issued to the police and to our own and other commonwealth and allied local military commanders as to the arrangements to bemade to ensure that an offender was brought before a civil court or a court martialas was appropriate. These arrangements are continuously applied from day today in the case of our own soldiers who commit offences against the civil law.3. An agreement was signed by the Brussels Treaty Powers on21st December, 1949, which will require legislation to enable us to deal with questions of jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences committed in the UnitedKingdom by members of the visiting forces of those Powers. As explained in cp. (50) 42, it would be impossible to introduce legislation dealing with these powers without also dealing with the position of the Americans, and we suggestthat the permanent legislation should repeal all the various temporary provisions and make general provision for all visiting forces. We think it impossible tojustify legislation granting in perpetuity the exclusive jurisdiction at presentenjoyed by the United States forces.4. In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, some Ministers said they were not satisfiedthat the proposals set out in CP. (50) 42 to confer concurrent jurisdiction on theUnited Kingdom courts and on the authorities of the visiting forces would worksatisfactorily; but such arrangements have in practice worked smoothly in respectof visiting forces from the Commonwealth and from our war-time allies, and asbetween our own civil and military courts. It would be necessary to make itclear to the Americans that the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether anoffending member of the American forces should or should not be brouo-ht before38563Copy No.     O
our courts would be ours, and that if we decided that he should (for instance, ina case like that of Hulten and Jones) then he would have to be handed over asis already the case in respect of the other visiting forces referred to. It wouldbe necessary for us to issue instructions to the police and for the Americans toissue instructions to their local commanders as to the practical arrangements whichwould be needed to cover the obligation of the American authorities to hand overto us any member of their forces who was to be tried in one of our courts, and,conversely, to cover the handing over by our police to the American authorities ofany person arrested by them who was to be tried by an American court martial.In order to ensure that there should be a consistent policy as to what cases-should be dealt with by our courts and what cases should be handed over to the americans, we propose that no prosecution of a member of a visiting force shouldtake place except with the consent of the Attorney-General or the Director ofPublic Prosecutions, or the Lord Advocate. This would also avoid any possibilityof a private prosecutor starting proceedings against an American soldier in &quot;acase which, on general grounds, would be appropriate to an American court martial.It would not be essential to have precisely the same arrangements in respectof all visiting forces; and in the case of the Americans the bias might be infavour of handing over an American soldier to be dealt with by one of his owncourts. But if on grounds of public policy it seemed expedient that the Englishcourts should deal with him for instance if he and a British subject had beenaccomplices in a serious offence then it would be open to us to insist on tryinghim and to ask for him to be handed over if he was in American custody. Togive the necessary time for a decision to be taken in any particular case, we contemplate the inclusion in the Bill of a provision on the lines of regulation 12 (2)of the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations, 1942, making it possible for a memberof a foreign visiting force arrested without warrant to be detained in custody forup to four days without being brought before a court.5. Doubt was expressed at the Cabinefs meeting whether the United states administration would be able to overcome the constitutional difficulties in the wayof placing the members of the United States forces under the jurisdiction offoreign courts. &quot;We doubt whether they could now place much reliance on thisdoctrine, since in the 1941 agreement about the leased bases they accepted that members of their forces should be subject to the jurisdiction of the colonial courts for offences other than &quot; security &quot; offences outside the leased areas, and they agreed to the provision being included in the United States of America (visiting forces) Act, 1942, whereby their exclusive jurisdiction in this country couldbe waived and the offender handed over to our courts to be dealt wih.6. It was also suggested that the Americans would argue that, in order tomaintain discipline, it was essential for them to impose for offences such as rapethe heavy penalties available under their military code. It is true that the americans used this argument in 1942, particularly in regard to rape, which isa capital offence under American military law. But we doubt whether there isvery much force in the argument in peace-time, and indeed whether the danger is not rather that their military courts will be reluctant to find a person guilty of rape when to do so involves passing a capital sentence.7. The suggestion was made that it would be better to put the Americans inthe same position as visiting forces from the Commonwealth. This would mean that the Americans would not be able to deal with offences of murder, manslaughterand rape; and it would not be possible to stop a private prosecutor from takingproceedings against an American soldier. As pointed out in paragraph 4 (a)of CP. (50) 42, we think it out of the question to expect the Americans to agreeto so drastic a curtailment of the privileges they at present enjoy. Could we hope to persuade them to agree that if, say, an American soldier killed anotherAmerican soldier in a brawl in an American camp they should have no power todeal with him? There is also the important consideration that we should not wish to be so limited in respect of our own troops abroad.8. There was some discussion of the question of reciprocity at the Cabinefsmeeting. In the notes scheduled to the United States of America (Visiting Forces)Act, 1942, the United States Government accepted as a general principle that itwould be right to give reciprocal treatment to our forces in the United States;and a war-time measure was passed recognising the rights of the Service courts
of certain visiting forces in the United States to exercise jurisdiction. We donot consider that it would be essential, before extending the privileges proposedin CP. (50) 42 to the forces of a particular Power, to insist on exact and continuingreciprocity, but, as suggested in that memorandum, we think that the new pro-visions should only be applied to a foreign Power by Order in Council if HisMajesty is satisfied that it is expedient that they should be so applied, and thatone of the considerations to be taken into account should be whether the foreign power is prepared to grant reciprocity.9. Questions were also raised about witnesses. The effect of the UnitedStates of America (Visiting Forces) Order, 1942, is to put American courts martial in much the same position as our own courts martial in relation to civilian witnesses. Civilians who do not attend when summoned, or commitperjury during a trial before a court martial, can be dealt with in our own civil courts. We are not aware that any difficulty has arisen on this point. we contemplate that similar provision would be made under the scheme which we propose.10. We agree that it is important that visiting forces from the Common-wealth should not be put in a less favourable position than foreign visiting forces,and it was for that reason that it was suggested in CP. (50) 42 that the new legislation might apply also to other Commonwealth countries and might repeal the Act of 1933.11. We recognise that it may well be difficult to secure an agreement withthe Americans on the lines suggested in CP. (50) 42; but we do not think itis possible to justify continuing the present arrangements in perpetuity, and we ask for authority to begin discussions with the Americans on the lines set outin paragraph 8 of that memorandum.J.J.
