Printed for the Cabinet;  May 1950.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   32CP. (50) 913rd May, 1950CABINETTOURIST ACCOMMODATION FOR 1951Memorandum by the Lord President of the council I think my colleagues should see the annexed exchange of letters with lord Ismay, Chairman of the Council of the Festival of Britain. I know thatcomprehensive arrangements exist for the handling of these problems, which arealways with us and which will merely appear in special and aggravated formsin 1951. At the same time I find it very difficult to assure Lord Ismay and his council that their anxiety about the position is groundless and that there willnot in fact be a serious breakdown in facilities for the accommodation of visitorsand for catering next year.2. The Festival of Britain will not only attract visitors from overseas, but will affect many parts of the country which normally see comparatively littletourist traffic. British visitors will also be attending exhibitions, festivals andother events away from home in probably very large numbers, and although the festival will be spread through five summer months, Considerable peak loads are inevitable.3. Modern experience suggests that more and more people respond toopportunities for seeing unusual and interesting events and exhibitions. It :&apos; -important after so many years in which so many of our people have been living in siege or emergency conditions that the stimulus which the Festival providesshould be as widely enjoyed as possible, but nothing can mar this enjoyment morethan an inadequate quantity and quality of catering arrangements and of accommodation. Also, the display of our best efforts in the arts, in design andin sciences in which we lead the world will make painfully obvious bur backward-ness compared with other countries in a great deal of our catering and provisionfor travellers. The catering industry is likely to be doing record business in 1951,but it must also expect exceptional criticism and if there is a mess the Governmentwill be blamed, although the Government has probably not sufficient control over these facilities.4. There are certain points on which the Government will be speciallyvulnerable to criticism. On accommodation, we must clearly do everything possibleto supplement the inadequate regular accommodation for travellers by organisingas much temporary accommodation as possible in private houses, Service andother camps and in schools and other institutions during the holiday period. TheService Ministers are trying to help as regards camps and I know other schemes are in train, but I must press for the most extensive possible arrangements ofthis character to be deyeloped in good time, as has already been so successfullydone for the Edinburgh Festival. It may. well be that many of our visitors whoare accommodated in private homes will fare better and enjoy themselves morethan some who have to brave the rigours of some of our hotels.5.   Government regulations affecting catering will also be very much undercriticism next year.   Is everything being done, for example, to mitigate the unfortunate effects of the Catering Wages Orders in reducing the comfort and38672
adding to the expense of staying in our hotels? Will the Minister of Food be ableto secure effective action in time to tighten up the cleanliness and standards offood-handling which so often horrify trans-Atlantic visitors, and indeed some of us as well? Can anything be done to give a lead to magistrates and the policeabout the operation in 1951 of our licensing laws, which are among the leastappreciated by overseas visitors of our quaint survivals? ,6. Are the handicaps which have been alleged to stand in the way of theproper equipment of our hotels with towels, soap and other elementary amenitiesbeing overcome ? ..7. I am putting in this paper not to make definite suggestions, which arenot my responsibility, but because I feel sure that the Cabinet will wish to take note, while there is still time to act, of the serious danger that a breakdown inaccommodation and catering may mar the success of the Festival of Britain andlead to criticism of the Government.8. I suggest that the time has now come when urgent and explicit instruc-tions should be given to the officials who are working on these problems, and thatthe President of the Board of Trade should be assured that he will be supportedin taking whatever reasonable measures he finds necessary to make sure that weare not unprepared next year.H. M.Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council, S. W. 1.3rd May, 1950.. ANNEX.1. Letter from Lord IsmayFestival of Britain, 1951,2, Savoy Court,London, W.C.2,21th March, 1950.Dear Lord President,As you know, the Council of the Festival of Britain have for more than ayear been very anxious about the arrangements for accommodating visitors to britain in 1951, and they have from the outset taken the view that responsibility in this matter cannot rest with the Festival Organisation, but belongs to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.At their last meeting on Wednesday, 15th March, the Council received aProgress Report from the Director-General (FB.C (50) 11) and there was con-siderable discussion about it. They were glad to note that a Working Party,under Board of Trade Chairmanship, is now in being for the purpose of dealingwith accommodation problems in 1950 and in 1951. As, however, there is as yet no real evidence that the problems are being successfully overcome, the council could not but feel continued anxiety.Apart altogether from the need for substantially increasing the number ofbeds available for visitors in London and elsewhere, the Council feel strongly thata great effort should be made to bring about a real improvement in the standards of hotel service and catering. They are aware of the efforts being made by such bodies as the British Tourist and Holidays Board and the Catering Wages Corn-mission to bring about such improvements, but, again, there is little or no tangibleproof that these efforts are meeting with success.The Council therefore invited me to inform you of the very great anxiety they feel about the whole position. There is so much to be done and so little time inwhich to do it that they consider that nothing but an all-out drive on the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government is likely to achieve the results which are needed.
I am terribly sorry to worry you when you are so pressed, but I would be most: grateful if you would give this matter urgent consideration. It would bean immense help to me if you could let me have any information which might serve to allay the Council&apos;s anxieties before their next meeting on 4th May.Yours sincerely,(Signed) ISMAY.The Right Hon. H. S. Morrison, M.P.2. Reply to the abovePrivy Council Office,Great George Street, S. W. 1,3rd May, 1950.My dear Mr. Chairman,I would like you to know in time for your Council meeting that the Govern-ment are actively engaged on measures for the improvement of tourist facilitiesbefore the Festival of Britain opens. Discussions with the catering trade havealready led the Government to announce considerable relaxations of the regula-tions governing meals.Please tell your Council that the Government are very much aware of theproblems and that these are having attention at the highest level.Your sincerely,(Signed)        HERBERT MORRISON.General Lord Ismay, G.C.B., C.H., D.S.O.
