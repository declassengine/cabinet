Printed for the Cabinet,   May 1950SECRET Copy No.&apos;CP. (50) 988th May, 1950CABINET32CANADIAN WHEAT AND FLOURMemorandum by the Minister of food. In preparation for the visit of Mr. C. D. Howe, the Canadian Ministerof Trade and Commerce, who is coming to London on 17th May to talk aboutwheat with us, I have been considering the line which&quot; we should take in these important discussions. Presumably he will want to ask us how much wheat and flour we should buy from Canada after our current four-year contract comes toan end in July this year, and what price we should be prepared to pay. Thesequestions are of vital concern to Canada. They are also of significance to usbecause wheat is the biggest single item in our Canadian import programme indeed it represented in 1949-50 roughly half our total imports from Canada.2.   Both questions are complicated by (a) Canada&apos;s and our own &quot;multilateral&quot; obligations under the international wheat Agreement (I.W.A.);(6) the unresolved difference between ourselves and Canada on the interprettation of clause 2 (&amp;) the &quot;have regard to&quot; clause of our four-year contract (see Appendix A to the Annex); and(c) the inevitable uncertainties about the future trend of supplies and pricesof cereals on the world market.3. The United Kingdom&apos;s wheat and flour requirements in 1950-51 are considered against the background of these factors in the memorandum annexed to this paper. In the following paragraphs I set out the conclusions which I havereached and the tactics which I recommend we should adopt in our discussions with the Canadians.4. Our freedom to buy wheat and flour on the most advantageous terms overthe next three years is already severely circumscribed by the obligations we have accepted and intend to honour as parties to the International Wheat Agree-ment. In entering into these obligations we have voluntarily deprived ourselvesof the advantage of buying more than limited quantities of sterling wheat inRussia, Argentina and elsewhere.5. There is good reason to think that world wheat prices have already passed the peak caused by the immediate post-war shortage, and that we are enteringa phase in which conditions will move in favour of the buyer of cereals. We cannot afford to accept any further limitations on our already restricted freedom to takeadvantage of such favourable changes in the conditions under which we buy ourwheat and flour. This should be the cardinal point of our policy, and should determine our tactics in the forthcoming discussions.6. The Canadians may well be apprehensive lest we should contemplate thepurchase.of Russian or Argentine wheat. Mr. Howe will doubtless raise this issue with United Kingdom Ministers. At the moment we have entered into noarrangements for buying wheat in the U.S.S.R. or Argentina.   Our action will
depend upon the terms of any offers which may be made to us. Moreover we cannot yet say how bur demands may develop having regard especially to the failure ofthe Argentine maize crop and our feeding-stuffs requirements. For these reasonsmy colleagues will appreciate that it is most important to give no indication thatjj  f;we will hot buy in these countries-we must retain a completely free hand.7. In acceding to the International Wheat Agreement we have given a binding undertaking to buy from the four signatory exporting countries a quantityequal to more than 85 per cent, of our total requirements, if required to do so, atthe minimum price. (The minimum price for 1950-51 is 1 - 54 Canadian dollars perbushel, and the maximum 1- 98.) In practice this commits us to buying in north america in the next crop year, again if we are required to do so, some 70 per cent,of our import requirements at the prescribed minimum-a price which is veryfair to the producer.8. Outside this very onerous obligation it is of vital importance, as I havealready said, for our programme to remain flexible so that We may be in a positionto take advantage of any changes in the relative supply and prices of wheat andfeedgrains and of the terms on which we can buy them. Our import requirementsof cereals for human and animal consumption are inherently liable to unforeseeablevariations, and our purchasing plans must retain the flexibility needed to meetsuch changes. The failure of this year&apos;s Argentine maize harvest, and the high prices now ruling for. non-dollar maize make this point particularly important.9. For the last four years we have bought an average of rather over150 million bushels of wheat a year from Canada, and in the last two years these purchases have earned Canada about 300 million dollars a year. The canadian government are bound to be anxious for the future, especially the immediatefuture, because all wheat importing countries will be trying to keep their dollar expenditure down to the minimum, and those in receipt of Marshall Aid will find it easier to buy United States wheat. (I understand from the Treasury thatthere is no hope of our being able to finance Canadian wheat purchases out ofE.C.A. funds in 1950-51.) Mr. Howe will probably start, therefore, by askinghow much Canadian wheat the United Kingdom proposes to take in 1950-51.Our obligations under the International Wheat Agreement are such that we canbe compelled to buy for shipment in 1950-51 though only at the minimum price-116-8 million bushels of wheat from North America (see Table III of the annex). This figure, however, includes the postponed 12-5 million bushels of ourfour-year contract with Canada and, therefore, means United. Kingdom purchases of no more than 104 million bushels of 1950^-51 crop wheat.10. The amount we need to buy from North America in order to meet ourbread and flour consumption and stock requirements-as distinct from the amountwe might be compelled to buy depends on how much we can buy from non-dollar sources. We have already said that we must preserve the right to buy in Russia,Argentina and elsewhere, and this is fundamental. But if we were asked to makea realistic assessment at the present date, we should have to say that we could onlybuy sterling wheat outside the agreement at a substantial premium over themaximum I.W.A. price. It would be difficult to justify paying such a premiumin present conditions because of the contingent liability to take dollar wheat underthe terms of Article V of the agreement. On balance, we think it right to assumeat the present time that our maximum needs will be equal to our obligation underthe International Wheat Agreement, i.e., to take 104 million bushels of newpurchases out of the 1950-51 crop.11. I recommend that we. tell Mr. Howe that,, in our judgment, the wholequestion is dominated by the existence of the International Wheat Agreement.We intend if called upon to do so to honour our obligations under that agreement and no further assurance than this appears to be necessary.12. We should then say that we estimate that in the 1950-51 crop year our requirements are about equal to the &quot; guaranteed quantity &quot; under the Inter-national Wheat Agreement and that, after allowing for supplies under the Inter-national Wheat Agreement from non-dollar sources, we shall need only 117 million bushels (inclusive of the 12 - 5 million bushels of Canadian wheat postponed fromthe four-year contract) to complete our requirements for the year. Subject to any political pressure from the U.S.A. in relation, for example, to the spending ofE.C.A. funds we should prefer to treat the question on a purely commercial basis.
13. It has always been our view, that, as the world supply position eased, thewheatrexporting countries should, within the framework of security provided tothem under the International Wheat Agreement, return to a competitive basis of marketing, and that the importing countries should be free to buy from the exporters who are best able to meet their requirements as to the type of wheat,price, terms of payment, date of shipment, &amp;c. The proportion of our dollar jwheat which will come from Canada will, therefore; depend on the Canadianability to compete with the United States in the United Kingdom market.!Accordingly, we see no occasion to make any further bulk purchase; nor do we propose to do so; we propose to buy, within the framework of the international wheat Agreement, on a commercial basis and through the United Kingdom^Canadian and United States grain trades as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. We have it in mind, moreover, to return as soon as is practicable toour traditional pre-war custom of buying on a c.i.f. basis, and we hope that theCanadian Wheat Board for their part will be willing to sell to the trade in storeFort William. The Canadians will appreciate that our obligations under theInternational Wheat Agreement are confined to buying at the minimum price, andthat our objective must be to pay a price no higher than this.14. We must be prepared for Mr. Howe to re-act strongly to such a state-ment of our position and he may well, at this stage, raise the question of theobligation which the Canadian Government contend is still outstanding underthe &quot; have regard to &quot; clause of the four-year contract. A note on this subject,will be found at Appendix A to the Annex to this paper. We must, in my view,maintain that the prices we have paid for the last two years of the contracthave fully liquidated any obligations which we may have had arising out of thisclause. However, if (as I expect) there is no chance of the Canadians acceptingour arguments on this issue we are in the strong position of being able to offerthem at no cost to ourselves what is really the most valuable concession they could obtain namely, an undertaking that we will buy from them, rather than fromthe United States, the bulk of our dollar wheat requirements in the coming cropyear (at this stage I would prefer to leave the precise quantity whether it isto be the full amount of our potential dollar liability or some lesser amount and.the detailed conditions for further discussion). This would give Canada somesecurity, the lack of which is at present her greatest worry, and provided westipulate that the price to be paid shall be the minimum under the international wheat Agreement it will cost us nothing. Any undertaking by the UnitedKingdom to buy Canadian wheat at more than the minimum would be regarded by the United States of America as conflicting Avith the principles underlying theInternational Wheat Agreement. ,15. The Canadians may argue that such an undertaking would be of no value to them because they already have the certainty of being able to sell to us and toother importers their full International Wheat Agreement quota at the minimum price by invoking Article V of the International Wheat Agreement. But anundertaking of this kind would be of considerable value to Canada since it would ensure a steady movement of wheat throughout the crop year. Moreover, suchan argument fails to take account of the specific provision in the international wheat Agreement whereby importing countries can be relieved of their obliga-tions to purchase if they have no financial resources to do so; moreover, theprocedure for enforcing the exporters&apos; rights and the importers&apos; obligations under Article V of the Agreement has not yet been tried and may well provevery difficult to operate.16. It is, of course, possible that the Canadians will reject such an offer,but if they do we cannot tell what counter proposals they may make, and I thinkit would be unprofitable to try to define now what our attitude should be in replyto any hypothetical Canadian proposals. I therefore confine myself at this stage to asking my colleagues to agree that the basic position we should take up in theforthcoming negotiations and our first effort to meet what we may expect to bethe Canadian position should be on the lines set out in the preceding paragraphs,viz : (a) In view of our obligations under the International Wheat Agreement,itis of vital importance that we preserve our remaining freedom overthe next three years to buy wheat and flour on the most advantageous terms wherever we choose.
(b) We shall probably need to buy about 104 million bushels of new cropdollar wheat in 1950-51 for human consumption, and this quantity isabout equal to the quantity which we may be required to take byreason of our obligations under the International Wheat Agreement but only at the minimum price.(c) The existence of the International Wheat Agreement does away with thenecessity for any agreement with Canada as to the quantity of wheatwe shall buy or the price we shall pay.(d) It is our intention to honour our obligations under that Agreement butto buy on a purely commercial basis. The proportion of our require-ments of dollar wheat which we shall buy in Canada will depend upon her ability to sell in competition with the United States of America.(e) We must maintain that the prices we have paid for the last years of thisAnglo-Canadian contract have fully liquidated any obligation whichmight be said to have arisen out of the &apos;&apos; have regard to &apos;&apos; clause inthat contract.(/) The only compromise which we could admit on this issue would be anagreement to take from Canada rather than from the United states at the minimum price a specified quantity of wheat of the 1950-51crop.M.

The United Kingdom&apos;s requirements of wheat and flour in 1950-51 havebeen based on the following assumptions : (a) /&quot;Flour deliveries...      .........      ... 97,000 tons a week\Extraction rate............      ... 85 per cent.(h) Millers&apos; receipts   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1,550,000 tonsBulk stocks at end-June 1951 ...... 12 weeks&apos; supply(a) Provision is made above for flour deliveries of 97,000 tons per week, butif deliveries should not exceed 92,000 tons per week the flour extraction rate could be reduced to 80-81 per cent, without additional wheatimports being necessary.(b) Millers&apos; receipts from the home crop are based on Ministry of Agricultureestimates of production and the proportions of the crop received by millersduring recent years.   The estimated receipts may be exceeded.On this basis requirements are estimated as follows : 
being the designated source in order to provide the desired 12 weeks&apos; stocks atthe end of the period, but about 10 weeks&apos; stock would result if this quantity were excluded. The following table summarises the position with regard to assumedpurchases under the I.W.A. The difference between the total of 156-0 m.b. shown below and the United KingdomV &quot; guaranteed purchase&quot; of 177-0 m.b. is accounted for by the obligations assumed by Colonial territories.Table III(Quantities in million bushels)	Already bought	To be bought for arrival by June 1951	Total	Balance to be bought for arrival after June 1951	TotalAustralia Canada Canada/U.S.A.      . :.. .

If provision is to be made for the purchase of any significant quantityof wheat from the U.S.A., the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements of wheat and flourfrom Canada in 1950-51 are less than 100 m.b. wheat equivalent, including the121 m-b., of which delivery has been, postponed until 1950-51, as compared withthe very much larger quantities taken under the long-term contract in recentyears: Table IV1946-47        ......1947-48 ......1948-49        .........1949-50        .........Less deferred quantity ...The import programme for the period July 1950^-June 1951 assumes procure-ment of the total guaranteed purchases of the United Kingdom, i.e., 156 m.b.for the United Kingdom, plus 9-3 m.b. of &quot;free&quot; wheat from Australia. Ofthe 156 million bushels it has been assumed that 39-2 m.b. will be obtained from non-dollar sources and the balance of 116-8 from North America. As this includes 12-5 m.b. of which delivery has been postponed from 1949-50, the netquantity of new crop wheat to be shipped during the I.W.A. crop year 1950-51from North America will amount only to 104-3 m.b. Depending upon thequantity bought from the U.S.A. the &quot;balance will represent the total of ourCanadian purchases.Should our Canadian purchases during 1950-51 represent as much as 100 m.b.,viz., the 12-5 m.b. postponed from 1949-50 at $2 per bushel, and 87-5 m.b. atthe minimum of the I.W.A. price range ($1-54 Canadian per bushel in store FortWilliam) the total cost would be about $ 160 million.  This would compare with : i ; .i Million dollars...... ! 946-471947-481948-491949-50(a) Devalued currency from September 1949.The foregoing may, in turn, be compared with $68 million representing theaverage annual cost of Canadian wheat (in store Fort William) shipped to theUnited Kingdom during the ten years 1929-38, based on average annual exports145-612-5Wheat equivalentm.b.168-4170-3146-2133-1261264292266(a)
of 79 million bushels at 86-5 cents per bushel. In the foregoing carrying: and;fobbing charges have been ignored as has the additional cost of the quantity taken as flOUr. /.,:;-.; , .2. Estimated World Supply and DemandFor the first time during the post-war years the United Kingdom will entera new crop year in a reasonably advantageous position.As indicated above and on the basis of the stated assumptions, stocks ofwheat and flour as at 30th June, 1950, are estimated at 1,655 thousand tons, the equivalent of 14 weeks&apos; consumption requirements. Supplies already assuredamount to 1,610 thousand tons leaving 2,803 thousand tons or about 105 million bushels to be secured. The problem is no longer from where and how much can we buy, but from where and now much should we buy, and excluding Australia thedecision presents certain complications. At this stage any assessment of the total quantity of wheat likely to be available for export from all sources during 1950-51is necessarily conjectural, but it is a reasonable assumption that, in terms of wheat equivalent, it will be of the order of 1,287 million bushels. Of this total the mainexporting countries are expected to contribute :  Table VMillion million tons bushels(a) U.S.A.     ...      ...      ...      ......           17-5 653(a) Canada    ...............           7-0 260(a) Australia ...      ...      .........           3-0 112Argentina ...      ............           2-5 95U.S.S.R. and others    ...      ......           4-5 16834-5       .&quot; . 1,287Note. (a) Members of the International Wheat Council.The Import requirements of the importing countries of the world (excludingChina and Korea) for the same period are even more conjectural. They are sub-ject to the same hazards of weather and will, to some extent, be affected by the availability of dollars, but 800 million bushels is thought to be a fairly reliablefigure. It follows, therefore, that if the foregoing assessment is reasonablyaccurate the total quantity of wheat potentially available may exceed the demand by nearly 500 million bushels. In normal circumstances this would result in ageneral lowering of prices. But the world shortage of dollars has, in effect,created two international wheat markets. The sterling wheat market is short of demand; the dollar market is in excess of demand. The overall condition of surplus does not, however, apply to certain individual exporting countries, e.g.,Australia. Given favourable weather conditions Australia may have availablefor export during 1950-51 a total of 112 million bushels of which 83-3 arehypothecated to meet her obligations under the International Wheat Agreement.In view of the demand for non-dollar wheat the disposal of this quantity isalready assured and there will probably be a ready market for the remainderoutside the International Wheat Agreement. The other non-dollar exporters,Argentina and the U.S.S.R., are not members of the I.W.A. and, although bothare expected to ask a price in excess of the I.W.A. maximum, it is likely that bothwill find markets for such quantities as they are prepared to dispose of. In theevent of any substantial reduction in North Ameripan prices, it is anticipatedthat Argentina will follow suit.3. CanadaIt is estimated that Canada will carry over about 105 million bushels of wheatat the end of July 1950 and for the year 1950-51 will have a total exportable surplus of 260 million bushels. To an extent which cannot yet be determined thedisposal of this quantity will be determined by the ability of potential buyersto find the necessary dollars. If E.C.A. funds are not available for the purchaseof Canadian wheat, and all present indications are that they will not be, Canadawill be in difficulty. The probable extent of United Kingdom purchases during1950-51 has already been indicated in the first section of this paper, hut evenif the United Kingdom were to take 100 million bushels Canada would still have to find an outlet for 160 million bushels and this will not be easy.   Apart
from dollar stringency the import requirements of Western Europe will be substantially less than, in recent years, and Continental.crop reports continueto be favourable. There is already some realisation of these altered conditionsin Canada. , Last year the Canadian Government guaranteed its producer aminimum of 175 cents per bushel. For 1950-51 the initial payment has beenreduced to 140 cents and, although some later increase may be authorised, theextent of the reduction is significant, and would seem to indicate not only ananticipation of reduced markets, but some doubt as to whether she will be ableto dispose of her guaranteed sales of 211 million bushels under the I.W.A. Evenif circumstances should compel her to invoke Article V of the International wheat agreement and call upon importing countries to implement their obligations atthe minimum price, Canada must be well aware that their obligations can onlybe met if the importing countries have the dollars. Mr. Gardiner.has alreadyrecommended a reduction of three million acres in Canadian wheat sowings asan essential part of his Government&apos;s policy of co-operation with the U.S.A. inlaying a foundation for continued E.C.A. financing. Whether this co-operation to reduce the wheat acreage to keep wheat prices up will be effective remains tobe seen. It is, however, certain that in the absence of U.S.A. dollars for &quot;off-shore &quot; purchases Canadian wheat will fall in price. It is also significant thatwhen allowance has been made for the difference in the rate of exchange canadian wheat is already being offered in the &quot; open &quot; market at a discount of rather over15 per cent, of the U.S.A. price. The conclusion that during 1950-51 Canadawill represent the vulnerable flank of the hitherto united front of exporters seemsinescapable.The question of our purchases of Canadian flour is likely to give rise to some difficulty. During the period of the war the flour milling capacity of Canadawas considerably extended, mainly to meet the increased requirements of theUnited Kingdom which reached a peak of 666,000 tons in the calendar year 1943.United Kingdom imports of Canadian flour for the period 1926 to 1949 are shownin Appendix B and it will be observed that during the period 1943 to 1949 theyhave been maintained at a high level. For 1950-51 we should prefer to reduceimports of flour to the lowest possible level, preferably about 250,000 tons, depend-ing on the quantity we may take from Australia. But Canada, in common withthe U.S A. and Australia, will find it difficult to sell her flour and may be expectedto vigorously resist so low a figure.The U.S.A.-The latest forecast of U.S.A. production of winter wheat is nearly 764 million bushels which compares with 901 million bushels in 1949. Onthe assumption that spring wheat will represent 250 million bushels Americamay well realise, despite set-backs in some areas, upwards of 1,000 million bushelsof new wheat. This, together with an anticipated carry-over of about 450 million bushels, will represent an exportable surplus of 653 million bushels. On the otherhand it is doubtful if her exports in 1949-50 will appreciably exceed 300 million bushels and for 1950-51 they are expected to be substantially less. For the firstnine months of 1949-50 her exports have only amounted to 237 million bushelsas compared with 391 million bushels during the corresponding period of 1948-49.The;storing and financing of her agricultural surpluses is already a major problem and for that reason alone it is unlikely that Congress will permit of dollars beingmade available for the purchase of Canadian wheat. In such event, however, theCanadian price will fall and it seems inevitable that the U.S.A. price must, tosome extent at least, follow.4.

The guaranteed purchases of the United Kingdom includingthe Colonies, amount to 177 million bushels of which it has been assumed that non-dollar purchases will represent about 50 million bushels, made up of 39 million bushels for United Kingdom account and 11 million bushels for Colonial account.This leaves the United Kingdom and its associated Colonies with a potentialdollar liability in respect of 117 million bushels and 10 million bushels respec-tively.  Quantitywise the position can be summarised as follows : Table VIIThousand tons Million bushels(a) Quantity assumed to be obtainable from australia and France under I.W.A.   ...(p) Balance of 1949-50 Canadian contract of whichshipment postponed until 1950-51 (I.W.A.) ...(c) Balance of guaranteed purchases representingpotential dollar liability        ...      ......(d) Total under I.W.A.     ............(e) Estimated total import requirements(/) Balance to be procured as free wheat......To the extent of about 10 million bushels the West Indian and West african colonies and probably the Mediterranean Colonies will buy as hitherto from north America under the I.W.A.The foregoing table shows that there is a joint United Kingdom/Colonialliability to buy about 114 million bushels at $1-54 (Canadian) per bushel ifcalled upon to do so under the provisions of Article V of the I.W.A. In termsof Canadian dollars this represents a contingent liability of about 176 million dollars plus dollar fobbing charges.Wheat Prices. The price range under the I.W.A. for 1950-51, in storeFort William is : Canadian currency Approximate sterling$     s.    d.Minimum per bushel ... 1-54 Per long ton .... 18 13 4Maximum   ,,    ,,       ...      1-98       ,,      ,,    ,,    ...      24    0    0Only when the exporting countries call upon the importing countries to buy isthe price necessarily at the minimum and even under the conditions which areexpected to obtain during 1950-51 it is probable that sales and purchases freelynegotiated in the early months of the crop year will be nearer the maximum thanthe minimum. The ability and willingness of importers to keep out of the market in the early stages is important as, for operational reasons, exporting countriesmust endeavour to maintain a fairly regular flow of exports. In the absence ofassured sales to the United Kingdom, Canada in particular will be vitally con-cerned to secure a market for a substantial part of her surplus before the close of navigation. This problem has not arisen since the end of the war as apartfrom the parallel world shortage of breadgrains her contract with the UnitedKingdom represented upwards of 50 per cent, of her total exports. In such circumstances the disposal of her remaining wheat at inflated prices was simple.Should the United Kingdom not be prepared to give any undertaking to buy aminimum quantity of 100 million bushels or thereabouts and should E.C.A.dollars not be available Canada will have to consider invoking Article V of theI.W.A. well in advance of the close of navigation. In such event it would seem that the United States in turn would have to consider the alternatives of invokingArticle V on her own account or endeavouring to hold her price as near themaximum as possible and risking the consequential fall in her exports. It hasbeen the declared policy of Australia to more or less equate her selling price tothe Canadian level and despite her favourable position as the only source of sterling wheat under the I.WA. she would find it increasingly difficult to hold herprice above the Canadian. Indeed, the fact that she has already sold 28 million bushels to the United Kingdom for delivery in 1950-51 at 15s. 3d. (Australian),i.e.\ lOd. per bushel below the I.W.A. maximum is an indication that she has not
overlooked this contingency. In the event of either Canada or the U.S.A.selling at or near the minimum it seems inevitable that the so-called open market price must fall to a point between the maximum and minimum of the I.W.A. pricerange. This would mean abundant supplies of wheat, conceivably at a price whichwould be at a discount as compared with non-dollar maize which will be in short supply during the period under review. In these circumstances it might well befinancially advantageous- indeed, it nlight be necessary to maintain feeding-stuffsrations to buy dollar wheat under the I.W.A. for animal feeding. It wouldprovide a reasonably priced feeding-stuff and might even bring down the price ofnon-dollar maize.The vagaries of the weather may, to some extent, falsify the foregoingassumptions. The operation of the U.S.A. domestic price support policy mayenable that country to hold prices at a higher level than market conditions wouldwarrant and some method may be devised to strengthen the exposed Canadianflank. But the balance of probability suggests otherwise and for that reason theUnited Kingdom should be able to obtain her wheat requirements under the I.W.A.from North America at substantially below the maximum.It should be noted that were the sole consideration the conservation of dollarsit would be possible to limit our demand for dollar wheat to about 76 million bushels (exclusive of the 12  million bushels carry-over) by some destocking andthe purchase of free sterling wheat at a premium. But if this were to be the totalof our demand of dollar wheat it is virtually certain that Canada, and probably the U.S.A., would invoke Article V of the I.W.A. and force us to take the totalof 104 million bushels, the guaranteed purchases under the I.W.A.conclusion in the light of the foregoing it remains to be considered what the policy of theUnited Kingdom should be regarding purchases from North America. In par-ticular it must be determined to what extent this policy will be shaped by politicalconsideration, both in connection with the scale and terms of our purchases and ouralleged obligations under the &quot; have regard to &quot; clause of the Canadian WheatContract.  The main points at issue may be summarised as follows : -(a) Particulars of the more important proposals and counter-proposals made during past discussions on the &apos;&apos; have regard to &apos;&apos; clause are set out inAppendix A hereto. There is no justification whatever for the inter-pretation of this clause in the manner proposed by the Canadians.Such interpretation is wholly unilateral and post event and had therebeen any intention on the part of Canada when the contract was agreedto claim compensation or for the United Kingdom to accept an obliga-tion to pay any difference between the price under the contract and thefree market price in the last two years there would have been no pointin entering into any agreement. The fact that provision was made fora minimum only of $1-25 per bushel in the third year and $1-00 inthe fourth year is sufficient refutation of the Canadian interpretation.The only obligation which devolved upon the United Kingdom was tohave regard to the open market price in the first two years of the con-tract, as one of the many factors to be considered in negotiating prices for subsequent years. The payment of $2 per bushel during the lasttwo years of the contract represents a handsome concession on the partof the United Kingdom and any suggestion that we have any obliga-tion under the clause referred to should be repudiated;(b) It will be observed in Appendix A, paragraph 2 (6), that in the course ofthe discussion in December 1948 the Chancellor of the Exchequer made certain proposals to Mr. Gardiner. Except for the offer to pay $2 perbushel during 1949-50 for 140 million bushels these proposals werenot accepted but the reference therein to our being prepared to buyon the conditions specified, at the option of the Canadian Government,100 million bushels in 1950-51 and possibly in 1951-52 may be raisedby the Canadian Delegation. Canada must be expected to press fora United Kingdom undertaking to buy substantially more than100 million bushels a year and, presumably, at a fixed price. There is,however, no reason other than political, why this claim should be con-ceded (see Appendix A, paragraph 8, also the Table of CanadianImports and the United Kingdom, Appendix B).    Canada has
guaranteed sales under the International Wheat Agreement for1950-51 amounting to 211 million bushels and of this amount theUnited Kingdom will in any event have to take a substantial share.The question to be resolved is whether we shall agree during the forth-coming discussions to take a specified quantity at a fixed price. Thereare objections to both, but in the latter connexion our recent purchaseof 28 million bushels of Australian wheat at a fixed price for deliveryover a period of six months will, no doubt, be quoted.  If, however, thel / United Kingdom grain trade is to be afforded an opportunity of revert-ing to its normal functions it is essential that the purchase by theMinistry of all cereals should be put on a c.i.f. basis as soon aspracticable. In present circumstances, the Ministry of Food must remain the sole importer of wheat and flour into the United Kingdom,but the buying and shipping would be left in the main to the trade.: ,, Certain administrative complications are involved but these need notbe considered in this context and the Canadians should be informedthat while the United Kingdom will buy from North America withinthe terms of the International Wheat Agreement it is not proposed toenter into any Government to Government commitments either withregard to the total quantity to be taken or the price to be paid.(c) Proposals on the lines of (a) and (6) above will not be readily acceptable to the Canadian Government and amongst other things they may beexpected to claim that: . , .      (i) Canadian farmers have &quot; lost &quot;nearly $350 million under the contract.(ii) Canada&apos;s war and post-war efforts to help the United Kingdommust be recognised,(iii) On the outbreak of war Canada virtually became the granaryof the United Kingdom and the bulk of the wheat shipped hasbeen made available under Mutual Aid arrangements.The answer to (i) has been given at (a) above; (ii) provides its ownanswer inasmuch as the United Kingdom also made a not inconsider-able contribution to the Allied war effort; (iii) is more difficult to dispose of, but unless it is demonstrably in the interests of both partiesthere is no good reason why the war and post-war shape of thingsshould be perpetuated in preference to a reversion to more normalconditions. Moreover, a return to unrestricted competition is not. contemplated inasmuch as Canada is assured of a market for at least211 million bushels of wheat during 1950-51 (increasing in later years) under the International Wheat Agreement. Our dollar problem will not be resolved before the period of the International wheat agreement has expired and while we shall have to buy substantial quantities of wheat from North America it may well be more advan-tageous to buy more freely than hitherto in the United States. In thecourse of the forthcoming discussions the Canadian Ministers maymake proposals which can reasonably be considered as alternatives tothe policy recommended above, hut as the nature of these proposalscannot be anticipated they will have to be dealt with on their meritsif and when they are made.Ministry of Food, W. 1,5th May, 1950.
&apos;   ;. Canadian Wheat Contract1. Following the discussions which were held in London during December1948 to negotiate the price to be paid for Canadian wheat in 1949-50 (the fourth and final year of the Canadian Wheat Contract) a joint announcement was madeto the effect that without attempting to reach a final settlement of the UnitedKingdom obligations under Clause 2 (b) of the Contract a price of $2-0 per bushelhad been agreed for 1949-50. It was also stated that the two Governments would meet not later than 31st July, 1950, to settle any obligations of the United kingdom which might then be outstanding, the extent of such obligations depending largely upon the actual prices ruling for wheat during 1949-50. The price of $2-00 forthe third year was only agreed by the United Kingdom to help the canadian government in the political difficulty they would have faced in accepting anythinglower when the United States wheat prices were temporarily at the peak level ofover $3-0.2. At the risk of over condensation the main proposals and counter-proposalsconsidered during the December 1948 discussion are summarised below: -(a) The Canadian Proposals (i) Canada has sustained a loss over the first two years of the contract of an average of $1-08 a bushel on 320 million bushels.(ii) Canada was prepared to cancel more than half of this &quot; loss &quot; andaccept in final settlement a payment of $1 - 00 a bushel on the 140million bushels to be delivered in 1949-50.(iii) The price to which this $1-00 should be added would be calculatedfrom whatever price Canada was able to sell to other countries.(iv) Canada would accept $2 - 0 a bushel basis for 140 million bushels tobe delivered during 1949-50 on condition that a final settlementbased on the foregoing paragraphs was made at the end of thatcrop year.(v) If this were not acceptable Canada would agree to accept $2-50a bushel for 1949-50 in final settlement of the obligations under clause 2 (&amp;).(6) The United Kingdom Proposals (as handed to Mr. Gardiner by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 18th December 1948) (i) The United Kingdom to buy 140 million bushels during 1949-50.(ii) The United Kingdom to pay $2-00 per bushel.(iii) If the average price of Canadian wheat sold for export outsidethe United Kingdom contract during 1949-50 should fall below, $1-50 per bushel the United Kingdom would have fully dis-charged alt of its obligations under Clause 2 (b).(iv) If the average price at (iii) above should fall below $1-75 butnot below $1 - 50 the United Kingdom would buy at the option of the Canadian Government, within the crop year 1950-51,100 million bushels of wheat (including flour) at a price of$1-40.(v) Should the average price in (iv) above equal $1-75 or more theUnited Kingdom would in addition buy within the crop year1951-52 at the option of the Canadian Government, 100 million bushels of wheat (including flour) at $1-40 per bushel.3. Neither of the above proposals were acceptable as a basis of settlement.Mr. Gardiner contended :  ij(i) That except in three years when wheat was not available Canada had never sold to the United Kingdom as little as 100 million bushels of.  wheat (see paragraph 8).(ii) The price of wheat was $1-55 when the negotiations on the Contractwere opened and had risen to $2-0. by about the time it was concluded,(in) Subsequently the price rose to $3-0 and occasionally to $3-40.
(iv) Canada&apos;s &quot; loss &quot; during the first two years of the contract was about$ 1 - 08 on 320 million bushels.(v) The Canadian understanding had always been that if the floor price inthe Contract proved valueless the &quot; have regard to &quot; obligation wouldbe settled by payment in the third and fourth years of a price higherthan the world price.4. 40n behalf of the United Kingdom Mr. Strachey said that arithmeticalcomputation of Canadian losses could not be accepted as a basis of settlement.The United Kingdom would never have entered into a Contract which wouldhave amounted to agreeing that the balance of advantage would, under any circumstances, rest with Canada. That an expected risk did not materialise wasnot a reason for deciding it was unwise to nave insured, or for requesting thereturn of the premium.5. It is virtually certain that in the forthcoming discussions the Canadianswill contend that the obligations of the United Kingdom under the have regardto &quot; clause have not been discharged by the payment of $2-0 in each of the lasttwo years of the Contract. They will, presumably, ask either that this be nowsettled by a lump sum payment, but more probably that the United kingdom should undertake to buy something of the order of 140 million bushels of canadian wheat a year for the next two or three years at a price to be negotiated. while on pur part we have already admitted, by implication at any rate, that we recognisean obligation under Clause 2 (6) of the Contract the fact remains that the clausewas never intended to enable the Canadians to ask any price above the Contractprice of $1-55. It was intended to permit of their asking and of our payingsomething more than the $1-25 and $1-00 respectively in the last two years ofthe Contract in the event of a collapse in the market. There is ample confirmation of this, but the statement made by Mr. MacKinnon (then Minister of Trade and commerce) in the Canadian House of Commons on 25th July, 1946, is probablysufficient: &quot; The Contract is based upon commercial considerations of mutualinterest. It ensures to the United Kingdom substantial quantities of wheatduring the expected period of shortage at prices below those which wouldbe payable were there to be a free market at the present time. This is thecommercial advantage which the United Kingdom secures. In the laterperiod of the Contract Canada receives the advantages of a guaranteedmarket, though for a diminished quantity, and of the assurance of at least the stated minimum prices. In determining the actual price in the last twoyears regard will be had to the extent to which the agreed price for the first two years falls below the world price for that period. Our farmers are,therefore, protected from crippling losses should there be a world slump inwheat prices.  This is the commercial advantage which Canada secures.&quot;7.   The following additional considerations are also relevant : (1) The prices of $1-55 for the first two years and $2-00 for the third and fourth years have given the Canadian producers a very fair return.Mr. Gardiner has publicly stated that these prices have beenremunerative.(2) The Canadian argument is based on the assumption that Chicago wheatprices are world prices. This is unacceptable. The Chicago prices have, in fact, reflected the high internal support price and the factthat the United States have provided the bulk of the dollars whichhave enabled certain importing countries to pay the high pricesdemanded.(3) Since the price for 1949-50 was agreed the International Wheat Agree-.... ment has become operative and provides for a maximum of $1-80and a minimum of $1-50 for 1949-50. (As a consequence of the devaluation of Canadian currency the maximum is now $1-98 andthe minimum $1-65. In terms of United States dollars, however, themaximum is still $1-80 aiid the minimum $1-50). The prices underthe International Wheat Agreement have so far remained at themaximum but, even so, we have paid Canada $2-00 a bushel plus6 cents carrying charge, which has been waived in respect of all othersales under the Wheat Agreement except to the United Kingdom.
(4) It seems highly unlikely that any E.C.A. dollars will be made availablefor the purchase of Canadian wheat in 1950-51. The United states will have very, substantial quantities of wheat for which there willbe no export market, and it seems inevitable that Canada will haveto call upon importing countries under the International Wheat Agree-ment to implement their undertaking to buy at the minimum. Forthe second year of the Agreement the minimum in terms of Canadiandollars is $1-54.8. As stated in paragraph 3 (ii) above, Mr. Gardiner has contended thatexcept in three years of crop failure the United Kingdom never bought as little as 100 million bushels of wheat from Canada. This is not home out by the records of imports during the inter-war years. The average United Kingdom imports ofwheat and flour from Canada and the United States for the period 1926-38 was79 million bushels. (See Table attached.) While the Canadians can be expectedto resist any suggestion on our part that we should buy from 1st August, 1950,onwards on a purely commercial basis, there are no logical grounds for their objection in so far as they now have an assured market for upwards of 211 million bushels under the Wheat Agreement, rising by a further 8 million bushels in1951-52 and by a further 2 million bushels in 1952-53. These quantities willbe further increased in the event of Japan acceding to the International wheat agreement. If as a concession we are prepared to agree to buy a minimumquantity of our dollar wheat from them this should be sufficient concession to liquidate any obligation, real or otherwise, in so far as the United Kingdom isconcerned.i

1. The text of clause 2 (b) the &quot; have regard to &quot; clause: of the UnitedKingdom/Canadian Wheat Contract is as follows : The actual prices to be paid for wheat to be bought and sold within the crop year 1948-49 shall be negotiated and settled between the UnitedKingdom Goyernment and the Canadian Government not later than31st December, 1947, and prices for wheat to be bought and sold within the crop year 1949-50 shall be negotiated and settled not later than 31st Decem-ber, 1948. In determining the prices for these two crop years, 1948-49 and1949-50, the United Kingdom Government will have regard to any difference&apos; between the prices paid under this Agreement in the 1946-47 and 1947-48crop years and the world prices for wheat in the 1946-47 and 1947-48crop years.2. The text of the announcement agreed between the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and Canada following the discussions held in December 1948was as follows : Representatives of the United Kingdom and Canadian governments have had discussions on the price to be paid by the United Kingdom forCanadian wheat in 1949-50, the fourth and final year under the UnitedKingdom/Canadian Wheat Agreement of 1946. After taking into accountall relevant considerations including, but without attempting to reach a final settlement of, the United Kingdom obligations under clause 2 (6) of theAgreement, the two Governments have agreed upon a price of 2 dollars perbushel.The two Governments have also agreed that their representatives shallmeet not later than 31st July, 1950, to settle any obligations of the United*   Kingdom which may then still be outstanding under clause 2 (o) of the Agree-ment.   The extent to which any such obligation will remain will depend largely upon the actual prices ruling for wheat during 1949-50.
