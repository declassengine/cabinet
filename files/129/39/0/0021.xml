(50) 20th Con-clusions, Minute 2), I think the Cabinet should be informed of the outcome ofthe meeting of the National Joint Industrial Council for the Gas Industry which took place on 13th April.2. After the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 6th April the Gas Council were toldprivately that it was undesirable at the present time to grant national minimumwages for manual workers in the gas industry at the rates proposed by theUnions, and it was suggested to them that they should offer to negotiate withthe Unions the removal of anomalies on an area basis. They were also told thatit was vital that there should be no giving way at the next meeting of theN.J.I.C. on 13th April, and that, if the Unions rejected the offer to negotiate onanomalies, the Gas Council should say that they must have further time toconsider the matter and adjourn discussions for at least a week.3. The meeting between the Unions and the Gas Council took place on13th April, and the Gas Council tried, without success, to switch the negotiations to removal of anomalies on an area basis. The Unions pointed out that aslong ago as last November the Gas Council had agreed in principle to a wagesstructure based on national rates of pay for labourers, and the Unions consideredthat the removal of anomalies at the present stage was not practicable withoutagreeing a national wages structure.4. After considerable argument the Gas Council secured an agreement to postpone further discussion on the following understandings : (i) The  desirability  of  establishing  a  national   wages  structure   forlabourers over 21 years old was agreed.(ii) The wages structure should cover two or three provincial rates withplus rates for the Metropolitan area.(iii) No change should be made in existing rates for grades other thanlabourers until new schedules have been prepared in the Areas oron a national level (i.e., there will be no automatic immediate increase for higher grades; the rates for these higher grades will all have to be considered separately on their merits).(iv) Employees who are at present receiving rates which are below the newgrade rates for their Undertaking should receive the new grade ratefor labourers, pending establishment of differentials.(v) Any new rates agreed shall apply as from 16th April, 1950.(vi) All these proposals would be considered and put before an adjournedmeeting of the National Joint Industrial Council on 26th April.(vii) Pending the further meeting no statement should be made by eitlher sideof the N.J.I.C. to the press other than that no decisions had beenreached at the meeting of 13th April, which had been adiourned until26th April.38583
5* The Gas Council feel that when they meet the Unions again on 26th Aprilthey will have to implement the agreement accepted by them in principlelast November by establishing on a national basis specified rates of pay forlabourers; if they do not do this, they will certainly be faced with stoppages,- which, although starting as piecemeal and unofficial stoppages, would inevitablyin time become widespread and officially sponsored.6. The question^ therefore, is whether the Gas Council are to, proceed onthe lines indicated above or whether, notwithstanding the grave implications ofGovernment interference of this kind, a general direction is to be given to theniunder Section 7 of the Gas Act not to agree to an increase in wages. Any suchdirection has to be published in the Annual Report of the Gas Council andwould in fact probably become known immediately.P. J. N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1,lUh April, 1950.
