[HIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETcp. (50)  67 copy13th nprtl,   1950cabinetno. 2) 2the housing programmeTenginnd TTnd n:.ies )Memorandum by the Minister of health i shall shortly have to announce to local author!-ties their allocations of new houses for 1951.2. On the best estimate I can make of the probablecourse of building construction (after allowing for expandingprogrammes for new towns and Government Departments) it willbe necessary in order to force the total number of houses under construction down to the level agreed last November toreduce the allocations to be made to local authorities for1951 to 120,000 - as compared with 1h8,000 for 1950 and170,000 for 1949-3s. The reduction will,  of course, have to be spreadthroughout the country.      For instance, I estimate that areduction of not less than 3,000 houses would have to be madein the allocations to trie London County Council and the Metro-politan Borough Councils.      It will mean some cuts in the direct labour&quot;work of local authorities and will make itpractically impossible to assist movements of labour toselected industrial areas.h. It is clear that a cut of this size will havealarming political repercussions.      The demand for houses isas clamant as ever,  and pressure for more housing is coming from all quarters.5. I am sure that it is better to restore the cut now,of our own free will, rather than have to yield later on underpre ssure.6. I accordingly ask ray colleagues to authorise me tomake to local authorities an allocation for 1951  of 1h0,000houses,  a figure which, together with the estimated programmes for new towns and for Government Departments, will enable usto continue house building at its present level of approxi-mately 160,, 000 houses under construction during 1951&quot;&apos;and 1952,and to secure the completion in these years of approximately/5,000 houses a year.7- It seems to me that politically the most propitiousmoment for an announcement of the restoration of the cub wouldbe in the Chancellor&apos;s budget speech.      I suggest that he might give as the reason for restoring the cut the greaterimprovement in our economic resources during 19h9 than was originally foreseen.      Moreover,  an announcement of this kind would go a long way towards mitigating any more harsh statermerits which the Chancellor may have to make.

5 S8, I had intended not to raise this question untilthe capital investment programme for 1951 came before ministers, but I believed that this would be available for the budget speech.      I now understand that this willnot be the case and this is my reason for raising thequestion at this time.9. My proposal is limited to England and V/ales, butI understand from the Secretary of State for Scotland thatif any relaxation is made he considers that a comparablerelaxation should be made for Scotland.Ministry of Health,  8.&apos;./. 113&apos;fH ..;PE1L, 1 950.
