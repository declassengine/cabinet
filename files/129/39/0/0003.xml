oTHIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT      printed for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 \CP. (50) 5329th March, 1950. - !iCABINETNATIONAL  HEALTH  service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At their meeting on 13th March, (CM. (50) 10th Conclusions, Minute 3),the Cabinet agreed that in the debate on the Supplementary Estimates for theNational Health Service on the following day I should announce that there wasto be a ceiling on expenditure on this service in 1950-51, and that appropriatesteps would be taken to enforce effective financial control over the expenditure of regional Hospital Boards and Hospital Management Committees. It was also agreed that the discussion of the finances of the National Health Service shouldbe resumed at a later date. At their next meeting (CM. (50) 11th Conclusions,Minute 1) the Cabinet agreed to resume before the introduction of the budgettheir discussion on the possibility of imposing charges for some of the facilities provided under the National Health Service.2. The decisions reached at the first of these meetings were announced during the debate on the Supplementary Estimates on 14th March. It is essentialthat we should reach decisions on the rest of the field before I open my budgeton 18th April. Already, in the debate on 14th March, it has been stated thatthe question whether we are or are not proceeding with the charge for prescriptionsdecided in October last is a matter for the budget.3. The Minister of Health is considering with the hospital authorities themethod by which closer control is to be exercised over the Service and the means that can be adopted to bring about administrative economies. He is also con-sidering economies in the parts of the service other than hospitals. I have nocomment on this side of the question at the moment.4. As regards the ceiling, the cost of the service has reached a level beyond which we certainly cannot afford to go at present, bearing in mind all the other claims on the revenue. Indeed, in my view a cost of  392 millions for 1950-51( 351 millions for England and Wales and  41 millions for Scotland) is alreadymaking an unfairly large claim on our resources, having regard to the other claims to be met. But there seems no doubt that we shall be faced with demands forextensions and developments of the health services and that those demands, evenif met on only a moderate scale, are likely to cost more than the reductions ofexpenditure which can be secured by administrative improvements and economies of management. In these circumstances we shall have to choose between eitherlimiting the demands for extensions and development or finding a source of income to set against their cost in the form of charges to the beneficiaries from theservice. In my view, it would be politically unrealistic to think that such demandscan be uniformly refused and I have therefore reached the conclusion that weshould be prepared to impose charges.5.   It is clearly not practicable to begin making charges by imposinginfinitesimal amounts as new items come along and, having regard to the presentheavy cost of the service, I think we should aim at a scheme of charges reducing38492
the cost of the service to about  350 millions, thereafter maintaining a ceiling ofabout that figure by periodical reviews of the charges, subject to reconsideration,of course, should our budget position change substantially.6. I recommend that I should be authorised to announce in my budget speech that we have decided to proceed on these lines and that we shall introduce thenecessary legislation and bring the arrangements into operation as quickly aspossible. :   &apos;7. On this basis, I think that the charge we have already decided to make for prescriptions might well be left to be imposed as part of the new scheme, andnot introduced in isolation. But I shall have to make the position on this itemclear in my budget speech. The yield of this charge (about  6 millions a year)has already been taken into credit to reduce the estimates to  392 millions.- &apos;&apos;     - -l R S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,29th March, 1950.
