.....&apos; barracks EC R&apos;E TchP.(5o) 7721ST APRIL.  1950CABINETSTOPPAGE IN THE LONDON DOCKSMemorandum by the Atto.rn.ey-GeneralMy colleagues may wish to know the legal implications of the  situation arising from the stoppage of work in theLondon Docks.My information as to1 the facts is incomplete, but asI understandj  the present stoppage has arisen following thedecision of the Transport and General Workers Union to expelthree, of its members on account of the action taken by themin connection with a previous dispute.    It  seems that the democratic disciplinary machinery established by the rules of the Union, which includes a right of appeal, was dulyemployed but that some of the members of the Union weredissatisfied with the decision and,  out of sympathy with theexpelled members, whom they regard as having been victimised,and at the instigation of a self-appointed Strike Committee,have ceased work.    It is important to observe,  since differentlegal results follow from it,  that some of the men concernedceased work in the course of the day&apos;s shift on the 19th Aprilthat is to say while they were working ships for the particular&quot;registered employers&quot; to whom they had been allocated, while others completed their days work but failed to reportthemselves at the call-stands on the morning of 20th Aprilas required by their obligations under paragraph 8 of the dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Order, 1947*On these facts my views are as follows(a) The present stoppage is not a &quot;trade dispute&quot; withinthe meaning of the Trade   disputes act, 1906,  or of theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order,  1940,nor is it a &quot;strike&quot; within the meaning of the last named Order.It is in effect an attempt by a section of Dock workmen to compel their Trade Union to reverse a decision come to inaccordance with the Union&apos;s rules and in the meantime to holdup work in&apos;the Docks in the hope that thereby pressure willbe brought to bear on the Executive of the Union,    It is clear from, reports of speeches I have seen that theMovement is  directed against the leadership of the Union.It is therefore manifest that the stoppage relates toa domestic matter within the Union.(b) It follows that the strike is not illegal withinthe Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order,1940,  and that criminal proceedings cannot be taken under that order.    Since,  however, it is not a trade dispute within theleaning of the Trade   Disputes Act, 1906, any conspiracy onCOPY mP ^

the part, for instance,  of the members of the Strike Committeeto induce a breach of contract or of the Dock Labour scheme by the Dock workers would, if it could be established byevidence, constitute an indictable offence at common law.    Asat present advised, I do not propose to prosecute for any suchoffence and the situation is,  therefore, not one for which any remedy is at present available under the Criminal law.(c) As regards the Civil lav/ the most obvious remedy is,of course,   that which is expressly provided by the disciplinaryMachinery set up by the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment)Order, 1947*    It is beyond doubt that the Dock Labour board would be entitled to employ that machinery against all or anyof the men who are failing to report at the call-stands.    TheGovernment has in law no power whatever to give directions tothe Dock Labour Board in this matter,  since (subject to suchinfluence -as the Government may see fit to exercise on particular members)  the decision is one solely within the domestic c impelenee of the Board.(d) Assuming that the obvious remedy contemplated by theStatutory Order Is not employed,  it remains to consider what other legal measures might be available.    There appearto be two possibilities : -(i)    Dock workers who had been allocated to particularregistered employers and who ceased working for those employers during the currency of their- engagement whether for the week,  or, moreusually,  for the day, committed a breach of thec mtract of employment existing between them andtheir employers.    For this breach their employers could, if so advised, claim damageseither by a civil action in the County Court or,under the Employers and Workmen Act, 1875,in the Magistrates Courts.    In the latter casethe amount claimable is limited to  10 exclusive of costs.    In order to obtain judgment for morethan nominal damages (a shilling or a penny)  theemployers would have to prove actual damage.This,  I think,  they would probably be able todo but only in a small amount.(ii)    Doc:: labourers not allocated, to particular employers are in the reserve pool and deemed to be in theemployment of the National Dock Labour Board.On the whole - although the contrary view is perhaps arguable - I think that they are so employed under a contract of employment into which certain terms are imported by the StatutoryOrder.    It does not follow that a breach of those terms,  although a breach of the Dock Labour Scheme,&quot;would entitle the National Dock Labour Board  tosue for damages.    In my opinion it is not soentitled.    I think that the contract is one whichsets up its own provisions for dealing with any breachand that these provisions, as contained in the disciplinary machinery, probably exclude the rightto bring- an act inn for damages in the courts in respect  of matters covered  (as the presentstoppage would be)  by the discipline code.    Thematter is,  of course,   mo on which the National dock labour Board would have to be independently advisedbut my present view&apos; is that actions for damages bythe Board would give rise to considerable legalargum. nt and would probably not succeed.    Moreover,even if such actions lay,  the Board might have difficulty in proving actual damage.

(e) The somewhat inadequate character of the other legalremedies available seems to point back to action under thejjock Labour Scheme itself,  which has been so often and soflagrantly violated, as being the most obvious course.(f) I take the opportunity of referring to the application0f the Conditi iris of Employment and National Arbitration Order,ytO,  to other disputes which may occur in the future.    The.threatened strike by stevedores in the London Docks would clearly be illegal.    So might a strike by engineers following the ballot now being taken.    It is my duty as Attorney-general to consider whether or not prosecutions ought to be brought under this Order and I must accept full responsibility.    I am,however,  entitled to seek the advice of my colleagues whetherthey are aware of any special - grounds which might lead me to consider such prosecutions inexpedient In the public interest.    I have-hitherto refrained from proceeding under the Order owing tothe fear that action might simply exacerbate the strike situation.I think it has to be recognised that the ordinary processes ofthe Criminal lav/ are ineffective to stop large-scale strike action,  but while this very explicit Order remains in existenceI find it increasingly difficult to refrain from operating it,since it is impossible to allow the law to be consistently andcontemptuously flouted.    As at present advised I am inclined to direct prosecutions in the next suitable case, which might be the threatened stevedores1 strike,  in which evidence is available.    While,  however,  in no way seeking to abdicate myresponsibility I  should be grateful for the advice of my colleagues if any particular reasons are known, to them affectingthe public interest which I might take into account in arriving at my decision.    It is indeed for consideration, whether it isdesirable to maintain the Order in existence at all if it is tobe broken with impunity.H.W.3.1ST APRIL, &apos; 195C
