Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRET 1 &apos;    - Copy No. 3 2c.p. (50) 975th May, 1950CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES BY PEERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OFPUBLIC BOARDSNote by the Prime Minister1. The existing instructions governing the political activities of the membersof Boards of socialised industries are contained in CP. (48) 53 (as amended bythe Cabinet on 26th February, 1948 (CM. (48) 17th Conclusions, Minute 4),) and include the following:-&quot; (a) Members of the Boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should not continue to serve as officers carrying out executive duties in any political Party.(6) Subject to (a) above, part-time members should be free to engage in any political activities, provided that they are conscious of their general public responsibility and exercise a proper discretion, particularlyin regard to the work of the Boards of which they are members.On matters affecting that work, they should not normally make politicalspeeches or engage in other political activities.(c) Whole-time members should abstain from controversial political activity.If they are Members of the House of Lords they may take part ingeneral debates in that House; but they should not intervene in debatesinvolving matters of political controversy.(d) Members of the Boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should be free, to maintain associations with Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies,trade associations, &amp;e, to the extent that such associations do not conflict directly with the interest of the Boards to which they belong.(e) Any member of a Board who is doubtful about, the application of these rules, or about the propriety pf any political activity, should seekguidance from the Minister responsible for the socialised industry with which he is associated. .        r(/) The foregoing rules apply equally to political activity on behalf of anyof the political Parties.&quot;2. The Lord Privy Seal has suggested to me that there is a tendency to interpret paragraph (c) of these rules too restrictively; and that we are losingthereby a good deal of valuable experience and support which Labour Peers could otherwise supply. I think there is force in this, and I have been considering how we can best secure a rather greater latitude of interpretation.   Uj ,-. ,3. The position of Peers who are part-time members of Boards is satis-factory : the difficulty arises with full-time members. One course which we mightadopt ivpuld be to amend paragraph1 (c) of the rules to read a? follows-i&quot; (c) Whole-time members  should abstain  f rom  controversial political activity.  If they are members of the House of Lords they should not;    :,U&apos;J -;-o&apos;.i take part in debates on the activities; of their boards as this mightV;i   -   -    impinge on the responsibility of the Minister.  While they should not38689 noto?o &quot;idnrmjK. ais no -gnlmr^ns to v^nqmq
make purely political speeches, there^isv-no -objection to their taking part in the many discussions in the House of Lords which are con-ducted on broad lines without party acrimony.&quot;* I am, however, somewhat reluctant to recommend this, since the formal proinul-gatioh of such a slight alteration in the rules might imply that the Governmentare purporting to exercise a meticulous control over the personal conduct, ofmembers of the Boards. The fewer and more general the instructions&apos;we issueon this subject the better. Moreover, if we alter the detailed rules governingintervention in Lords&apos; debates, we may be asked whether we are modifying thegeneral instruction that whole-time members should &quot; abstain from controversialpolitical activity,&quot; and we may become involved in discussion of what whole-time members may do in other forms of political activity.4. I suggest that we should avoid appearing to make too much of this matter,and should treat it as little, if anything, more than a matter of interpretation ofthe existing rule. I therefore propose that the Ministers responsible for socialised industries should send a letter to Chairmen saying that it has come to their notice that the existing rules may be being interpreted too narrowly in relation todebates in the House of Lords, and that it is not the Government&apos;s intention that paragraph (c) of the rules should operate to prevent full-time members of the boards who are Peers from taking part in general discussions in the House ofLords which are conducted on broad lines without Party acrimony. I would thensend to Labour Peers who are still full-time members of public Boards a letter inthe terms of the.annexed draft.5.   I should be grateful for my colleagues&apos; views on these proposals.r\ &apos;&apos; C. R. a.10, Downing Street, S. W. 1,&apos;,   5th May,: \ annex draft Letter to Labour Peers who hold Positions in Nationalised- -a.&apos;,-&apos;/- i-oO UndertakingsI have had:some discussion with Addison as to the conditions under whichPeers who hold positions in nationalised undertakings should participate indebates in the House of Lords.In a memorandum issued in March 1948 the Government laid it down that members of the House of Lords might take part in general debates, but shouldnot intervene in debates involving matters of political controversy.I think that there has been a tendency to interpret this ruling toorestrictively.It is, Of course, undesirable for members of Boards to take part in debates onthe activities of their own Boards, as this might impinge on the responsibility ofthe Minister; Also&quot; they should not make purely political attacks on the Oppo-sitiohi; But although&apos;there is always some savour of controversy in all debates,many discussions in the House of Lords are conducted on broad lines, withoutParty acrimony. ,,, M/vf^j-?;  ------.-,v-- .h-&apos;-rIt is rnost.desirable that the Labour position should be supported in debate,&apos;ry reasoned statements from men of experience such as yourself.   For instance,here are matters of economic or social policy, where some of our members in the lords speak with unrivalled authority;   I am assured by Addison that the house would welcome their contributions.      in-via^s-J:,&apos;- -m-;        U.   .-A;-- iJo ?:;-. I should,&apos;&apos; therefore, be glad if you would look out for opportunities for taking part in debate and would consult with Addison&apos; if you have any doubt as to the propriety of intervening on any particular occasion. aXi ::
