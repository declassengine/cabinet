IS DOGUMEI-iT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVTaRNMENT)fiji 0 R E Tf!.P. (50)  88 COPY NO. QeX1ST MAY,   1950CAB INETSOUTH WEST AFRICA - PROCEEDINGS BEFORETHE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Minister of state at its 19k3 Session the General Assembly of theUnited Nations, besides reiterating its previous resolutionsurging that South West Africa be placed under trusteeship,passed a resolution, the text of which is annexed, referringcertain legal aspects of the question to the international court of Justice for an advisor:/ opinion.      The matter will come before the Court this month.2. Under the procedure of the Court, every Member ofthe United Nations has a right to intervene and present what-ever arguments it thinks fit in order to assist the Court toreach its conclusions.      Speaking generally,  it is desirablethat before the Court gives an opinion on any question all aspects of it should be argued before it.      In all cases up tothe present at least four or five Governments have intervenedand the conflicting views -which may be held on questions havebeen reasonably fully argued.      On the present occasion theUnion of South Africa will be represented by her Senior LawAdviser and it may be taken as probable that several anti-Colonial Powers who feel strongly on the subject of the Union&apos;snative policy and what they consider to be its obligationsregarding South West Africa, will intervene.      It is necessaryto decide whether the United Kingdom also should exercise itsright of intervention.3* Two of the questions submitted to the Court haveaspects directly affecting the United Kingdom -(i)    &quot;What is the international status of the territory ofSouth West Africa and what are the international obligations of the Union of South Africa arisingtherefrom?&quot;Our interest here arises in connection withChapter XI of the United Nations Charter, i.e.  thechapter concerned with &quot;non-self-governing territories&quot;.It contains, in Article 73(e), an obligation on colonial Powers to transmit to the United Nations,for information, certain technical information abouteconomic, social and educational conditions in their&quot;non-self-governing territories&quot;.      The obligationis expressly stated to be &quot;subject to such limitationsas security and constitutional considerations may require&quot;.      Large majorities in the United nations have constantly sought to bring political and consti-tutional information within the scope of this obligation and to use it as the basis for establishingUnited Nations control and supervision over the

administration of all dependent territories(particularly in relation to political and consti-tutional developments).      The United kingdom has consistently rejected these attempts.One line of attach developed by the anti-Colonial groups has been to demand that a Metro-politan country should not cease supplyinginformation about a territory under Article 73(e)without satisfying the General Assembly that it is justified in doing so on constitutional grounds.If we complied with this demand, we should be per-mitting the United Motions to interfere in ourrelationships with our dependent territories attheir most delicate stage, i. e.. when those terri-tories are on the point of achieving internal self-government.      The Slavs and others would maintain that the form of self-government accorded to anyparticular territory was a shadow and not theSubstance, thereby strengthening the hands of local political extremists prematurely demanding more complete autonomy or the severance of ties with theCommonwealth.Our contention is that the responsibility for determing the extent, if any, to which &quot;constitu-tional considerations&quot;, as specified in Section (e)of Article 73, affect the obligation contained inthat Section to transmit information in respect ofany dependent territory rests exclusively with theMetropolitan country.A case in point is that of Malta.      We sentinformation to the United nations about Malta until&quot;19U7j when the island was granted a constitutionconferring upon Maltese Ministers responsibility forsupplied information about Malta,  on the grounds thatit.-would be constitutionally improper for us to do sosince the island has internal self-government,  just as, when a Question is ashed in the House about matters within the responsibility of Maltese Ministers, theSecretary of State for the Colonies declines to answerOur interest in regard to this -particular questionaddressed to the Court is therefore that,  if theCourt decides that South Mest Africa, is_a &quot;non-self-.governing territory&quot;,  it should either refrain fromexamining in detail the obligations of the Union,^ov.ernrne,nt in ,relation, to the territory,/under. Article.73..SJJLJSl.S.e, ,sJiould, ^nflpjzjjS-Pur; vie^JLhat^the, .responsibility-responsibility for determining the &quot;constitutlnnnl limita-t i nns &quot; undeP. paHftgi:aph  ( e )  of the  .&apos;,rt, i o. 1 e  cs at a Hi t bthe Ms11minl itnp Pow.-.r- conqqrnerl.       If the opinion  ofthe Court went against us, a precedent would be created whereby every time we granted a. dependentterritory internal self-government we might have tosatisfy the Court that the constitution did in factgrant self-government.      This would be especiallydangerous in territories in which we have importantstrategic interests, since the Court might be unwilling to regard as self-government a form of constitution,  such as those in Malta, and SouthernRhodesia, where His Majesty&apos;s Government retainreserve powers in certain limited fields, such asdefence and foreign affairs.- their own internal afff fairSince 194/ we have not it.

(ii)    11 Has the Union of South Africa the competence tomodify the international status of the territory ofSouth&apos;West Africa?      If not, where does thecompetence to determine and modify this statusrest?&quot;If the Court&apos;s consideration    of this, questionrelated solely to South West Africa as a formerKandat ed t a rr it or y, no interest of liis Majesty1 sGovernment would be involved.      But,  if the Courtdecided in reply to question (i) that South WestAfrica was a &quot;non-self-governing territory&quot; as defined in Article 73 of the Charter,  and decidedfurther that competence to alter the international status of South West Africa did not rest solely withthe South African Government, it would be of greatimportance to His Majesty1s Government that this latter opinion should be related solely to the factthat South West Africa is a former Mandated territory and not in any way to the fact of its being otherwisea non-self-governing territory.      The consequences for us would be incalculable if the Court were to-pronounce an opinion having the effect of suggesting that tho international status of a non-self-governingterritory which has not been administered underMandate or trusteeship could not be modified by theMetropolitan country save, for example, with the prior concurrence of the General Assembly, or thatthis was a matter in which the Assembly had a locusstandi.      It would mean in fact that the assembly would have a right to be consulted before we grantedself-government to a Colonial territory.H. Thus both questions - and particularly the second -may lead to points being raised which closely concern us as a colonial Power and it is of the greatest importance that the findings of the Court  should not be such as might embarrass usin future.      There is,  however,  reason to fear that,  if these points arise and South Africa is left to argue them alone, theCourt will be inclined to come to a view adverse to that whichthe United Kingdom would desire, partly because South Africa,which has not handled her case well in the United Nations, maywell present her case unattractively before the Court.      More-over, South Africa will undoubtedly devote the principal weight to her argument to another point, namely that South West africa is not a dependent territory at all,  and may deal insufficientlywith questions which only arise  if she is wrong in this contentions-tion.       It is also possible that a number of countries (who, as explained in paragraph 2, may intervene) might argue skilfullyon the other side.      But, although, it is difficult to form an appreciation of the actual risk that the Court may formulateon the points mentioned above conclusions which would beprejudicial to our own direct interests, these interests seemto be too great to risk trie possibility that the case- on mattersof direct concern to us might go by default.5* The question of our intervention is, however, compli-cated by other political considerations- of great difficulty.Throughout tho discussions of the South West Africa question before the United Kationa during the last three years theUnited Kingdom has as far as possible taken up a friendly andhelpful attitude towards the Union Government and on some ofthe issues now submitted to the Court we have- argued publiclyin favour of the South African case.      Thus we have committedourselves to the view that the Union is under no obligation under the Charter, notwithstanding that South  Vest Africa wasformerly under Mandate, to place the territory under trustee-ship.      The Union Government are expecting us to intervene andthey might well feel that we ,/ere not acting consistently with

our past policy if we held ourselves aloof from the proceedings.Of much greater political importance, however, is the poss-responsibility that intervention on our part might be misunderstood,and provoke adverse criticism in this country and in theColonies.      Considerable sections of public opinion here andin the Colonies are deeply concerned over the native policyof the Union Government and might easily interpret our inter-vent ion as in some way a condonation of that policy.      Thepresent is a particularly unpropitious moment for appearing toalign ourselves with the Union Government on matters con-cerning dependent peoples, and it is of the greatest importance that we should, not&quot; give the impression that our attitudetoward matters of native policy is in any way the same astheirs.      If we intervene in order to safeguard our own vital interests as a Colonial Power, the arguments we must use couldbe misinterpreted, as supporting at least part of the SouthAfrican case.6. On balance, we consider it essential that we shouldbe represented at the hearing of the case, but it is most desirable in deciding on&apos; the form of our intervention to bearin mind the importance of giving the least possible occasion for unfavourable political reactions.7. V/hen the Court is called upon for an advisoryopinion, the day before the hearings begin the President holdsa&quot; meeting of the agents of the Governments which have intimated that they will be represented at the  oral hearing.      At thismeeting the President asks the agents whether the representa-tives of their Governments wish to intervene orally and, if so,for an estimate of the time for which they will speak.      the agents cannot choose the time at which the representatives oftheir Governments will address the Court;    the latter speakin an order determined by the President.      Having spoken once,no advocate has a second opportunity to speak, save withspecial leave of the Court.      The ideal solution from our pointof view would be that our representatives should attend with awatching brief,  intervening only if points were raised directlyaffecting our own interests.      (This would entail some risk ofdisappointing the South African Government, but in our viewthat would, be a considerably lesser disadvantage than the riskof being misinterpreted as wishing to support the Union Govern-merit in a matter concern in;; dependent peoples.)      At thepreliminary meeting between the President of the Court and the agents of the countries intending to participate we could try to obtain the consent of the President to our agent 1s applying to speak if on hearing the other arguments he or counselthought that points had been raised on which he considered itdesirable to address the Court.      There would be no otheropportunity for doing this, and there is some doubt whetherthis procedure, for which there is no precedent, would meet with the President&apos;s approval.      If it&quot;did not,  our agentwould therefore have to be prepared to state that we intendedto speak.8, Vve have received a request from the Registrar of theCourt asking that lie be notified, by 6th May, whether HisMajesty&apos;s Government intend to participate in the oral pro-ceedings and that,  if so, thoir representatives should be designated.      If our colleagues agree with the tacticssuggested in the previous paragraph we would propose to replyto this request that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend toparticipate, naming our representatives.      Such a reply wouldnot prejudice our intention to seek permission to address theCourt in the circumstances set oat  in the preceding paragraph.

9. If the President does not agree to our agent&apos;ssimply reserving a right to speak later and our agent orcounsel is therefore obliged in any event to present arguments on some points at issue before the Court, he may come to theconclusion that,  in the light of what is said in the courseof the proceedings, he should remain silent on the questionsof special importance to ourselves.      It is difficult to say at this stage on what precise points he might in such an event feel it best to address the Court.      The written sub-missions put in by the Governments of South Africa, Slgypt,Poland,  India and the United States, when we have been ableto study them, will give us a fairly clear idea;    butadditional points may be made orally in the course of theproceedings.      So far as we can see at present, however,  itshould in such circumstances be possible, although notnecessarily desirable, for our representatives to confine their oral,intervention to the point that there is no legal obligation&apos;on the Union Government under the Charter to placeSouth West Africa under trusteeship.      This is a matter of thelegal interpretation of the Charter and we are on record as having expressed this view several times in the United Nations10. It should be possible for our representatives at theCourt to mitigate the danger of undesirable political reper-cussions by informing press representatives that we are not concerned with the case of South West Africa as such, but that-the Court, in dealing with South West Africa, may have to con-side r several points affecting the legal interpretation of the charter which concern all Powers, including ourselves, with responsibility for dependent territories.Conclusions11. In view of the importance to us as a Colonialpower of some of the issues that may be raised before theCourt, we feel -,/e ought to be prepared to incerveae in orderto safeguard our own interests.      Wo recommend that we should endeavour to secure the consent of the Court to our agent&apos;sreserving the right to speak later in the debates if points should be raised on which he or counsel desire to address the Court - on the understanding, however, that if this&apos;procedure were not agreeable to the Court our representa-tives should have authority to speak in any event.J*.
