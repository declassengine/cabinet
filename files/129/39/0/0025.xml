SECRETCP. (50) 752IST APRIL t  1950CHINESE CONSULS IN MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Minister of state on 27th October the Cabinet approved therecommendation in CP, (1+9)  21U that the impact of de jure recognition of  the Chinese People&apos;s Government upon UnitedKingdom interests in the Par East should be considered at aconference of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Singaporeunder the chairmanship of the Commissioner-General for SouthEast Asia (C,M.(h9)  62nd Conclusions, Minute 7).    It waspointed out in the Cabinet&apos;s&apos;discussion that de  jure recognition of the Central People&apos;s Government would create aspecial problem in Malaya, since there might be somedisposition among the Chinese community to assume that thiswould  justify the cessation of punitive measures against theCoramuni s t bandits.2. At the Singapore Conference, which was held inNovember,  1949?  it was appreciated that recognition meant that Chinese Communist Consuls -would in due course have tobe accepted in the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.It was realised that their appointment would create diffi-culties, but the view was taken that these difficulties should be dealt with ad hoc, and not be held  to justifydelaying recognition.    It was felt that though theappointment of Communist Consuls could not be long delayed,any possible delay should bo contrived while the present emergency existed,    During the discussions which took place,His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to China expressed the view that theappointment of Communist Consuls to Malaya would not involve any major accretion of strength to the Communistcause,  since it was quite possible for China to send inagents through clandestine channels who, by operating-underground,  could be far more effective than Consuls, whose activities were bound to be restricted by their officialposition.    He thought it possible that as a result of communist successes in China attempts would in fact be madeto step up the terrorist campaign in Malaya by subversivemethods.    Subsequent events seem to have borne out at anyrate the second of these conclusions, for from our point ofview there has been a marked deterioration in the situationduring recent months.3. Though- diplomatic relations between the UnitedKingdom and China have not yet been formally established,it had been the  intention, once they were established,  toask the Central People&apos;s Government to accord formal recognition also to His Majesty&apos;s Consuls in China who,though still remaining at their posts,  have not yet been accorded any official position by the new Government.31COPY NO.CABINET

His Majesty&apos;s Charge 6&apos;Affaires was accordingly instructedto take up this matter on the conclusion of the preliminaryand procedural talks,  and, if the Central People1sGovernment enquired whether reciprocal treatment would be accorded to Chinese Consuls,  to inform them that theUnited Kingdom Government considered that the central people&apos;s Government were entitled to take over all ChineseConsulates in British territories.h. Shortly after these instructions were issued theHigh Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya represented that,  although he had reluctantly agreed to therecommendations of the Singapore Conference, the situation had now changed to such an extent that he could no longerfind it possible to justify the acceptance of ChineseConsuls in the Federation until the emergency was over(there  is no indication when this will be, but clearly itcannot be for many months).    His view was based not somuch on the difficulty of preventing direct contact betweenChinese Consuls and the Malayan bandits - a risk whichwas foreseen and accepted at the Singapore Conference -but on the fact, which has only become apparent in recent months,  that the mere prospect of the admission of Consulshas already had a most serious effect on the Chinesecommunity in Malaya,  and that their actual admission,  after all the apprehensions which have been expressed by that community, might well have incalculable consequences onthe course of the emergency.      He pointed out that one ofthe main difficulties in coping with the bandit movementhad been the hesitancy of the Chinese community, partly from fear of direct intimidation by the bandits, butequally from reluctance to commit themselves to theGovernment side until it was clear that the Governmentwere going to win.      This problem has been aggravated by communist successes in China as well as by the continued and  spirited resistance of the bandits.      The HighCommissioner reported that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;srecognition of the Central People&apos;s Government had alsoaroused considerable misgivings among the leaders of theChinese community, but had  in general been accepted as a fact of political realism.      They had indeed come out more strongly than hitherto during the last few months againstthe bandits and had striven with some success to mobiliseChinese opinion more actively to the support of theGovernment.      Several representative Chinese bodies had sofar committed themselves to the support of the government as to pass resolutions urging that Chinese Consults shouldnot be appointed to Malaya.5. The High Commissioner pointed out that it was absolutely essential,  if the emergency was to be brought toa successful and reasonably rapid conclusion,  to have notmerely   the passive acquiescence of the Chinese community,but their active support in denying supplies and shelter tothe bandits and in giving information to the authoritiesabout their movements.      His conclusion was that theappointment of Chinese Communist Consuls would shakeseverely the confidence of the Chinese in the governments determination to eliminate the bandits,  that the Chinesemight well decide that the time had come to make their peace with the other side and that they would consider that

His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the retention of BritishConsular posts in China as. of greater importance than thesecurity of the people of Malaya.      The Commissioner-General^the Acting Governor of Singapore and the Commander-in-chief,Far East Land Forces,  support the High Commissioner&apos;s viewof the dangers and consider his apprehension fully justified.6. The crux of the situation in Malaya and Singaporeappears to be the effect on the Chinese population of theappointment of Chinese Consuls of the People&apos;s Government.It has been reported to the Colonial Office that there arein fact three elements in the Chinese population.      Themerchant community and leading business men, many of whom,are British subjects of long standing,  are opposed to thePeople&apos;s Government.      Left-wing sympathisers,  fellow-travellers, principally school-masters,  students and clerks,have been encouraged by recognition of the People&apos;sGovernment and are now trying to secure leadership of ancontrol over the overseas Chinese communities.      The main body of overseas Chinese,  however,  are inclined to fear forthe future and are more than ever anxious to sit on thefence.7. In the policy which M. Stalin laid down-as long ago as 1525 for the revolution in colonial territories,  he stated that where there was a small proletariat and more orless developed industry the object must be to align theworkers and the petty bourgeoisie against the imperialists&apos;&apos;and those elements of the bourgeoisie which work with it&apos;&apos;.The destruction of the upper bourgeoisie is to develop fromthis process.      The significance of this policy to thethree elements of the overseas Chinese -population needs tobe considered.      If action is to be taken to exclude chinese communist Consuls from Malaya which cannot fail to arousethe hostility of the Chinese Peoplers Government,  the lattermay be expected to try to accentuate the cleavage betweenthe various elements of the community.      While it isencouraging to note that the section of the community whichqualifies for the definition of upper bourgeoisie under theStalin doctrine is coming out in more open support of theGovernment, It really has no    other choice, since it willbe the first to be eliminated  if the Communists prevail.Unfortunately -past experience with the Chinese has tended to show that the merchant and upper trading class is theleast militant and usually non-resistant when it comes to open conflict with the Chinese national interest,8. Again, experience of the Chinese people suggeststhat they will remain at least passively law-abidingcitizens of a country which is to them foreign as long asthey are not faced with the necessity of choosing to renounce their loyalty to the National Government of China(whether it be Communist or otherwise).     A refusal to admit Chinese.Consuls to Malaya is bound to cause a dispute between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment.      This will have the effect of confronting the overseas Chinese in Malaya with the necessity of making a choice.      While those whose elimination would be the firstobject of any Communist regime may decide to burn theirboats   and declare their co-operation with British authority,

it is possible that those who are  sitting on the fence willbe in even greater fear than before, while those who arein favour of the Chinese People&apos;s Government will become more active in their opposition to our authority.      Theconsequences of such a development might therefore transcendthe effect which may ensue  from the acceptance of chinese communist Consuls in Malaya.9. In view of the difficulties of this problem,examination has been given to suggestions that we shouldcontinue in some way to delay the appointment of ChineseConsuls indefinitely.      These lack reality, because thereis nothing that we can do,  short of arbitrary discrimination,(which is bound to provoke retaliation)  if,  in the event,the Chinese People&apos;s Government should establish normaldiplomatic relations and confirm the status of our Consulsin China.      If they do not do so,  the present position will,of course, be maintained,  and no Chinese Consuls will go to malaya.      Equally,  if they attempt to restrict the numberof our Consulates in China or to restrict their functions,it should be possible to take action helpful to Malayabased on reciprocity.      It is, however,  necessary toconsider what our position will be if and when n-ormaldiplomatic relations are established and the question ofConsuls becomes a live issue.      We are advised that,although there is an inherent right on the part of any government to refuse to allow the appointment of Consulsto any given place,  it is unusual to refuse to permitConsulates where they have existed before and where good reasons can be adduced for their continuance.      It is the type of action which has hitherto only been taken by governments such as the Soviet Government.      It must beexpected, therefore,  that a refusal to permit the re-establishment of Chinese Consulates in Malaya and Singaporewould lead to retaliation and the probable closing down ofthose Consulates to which we attach importance in China.It would also weaken our general case for objecting to similar action if taken against us in any other part ofthe world.      It should here be noted that there are,  inall,  seventeen Chinese Consulates in the United Kingdomand dependent territories, as compared, with thirteenBritish Consulates in China,      Even if we should attemptto bargain on the basis of reciprocity,  it is unlikelythat the Chinese would be -prepared to sacrifice theirConsulates in Malaya and Singapore, where there are,  infact, large overseas Chinese communities.      Thus,  thoughit might be possible to contemplate a reduction in thenumber of our Consulates in China,  it is unlikely thatthis would achieve any object.10. The above considerations have been put to theauthorities in Malaya and Hong Kong and H.M.  Charged&apos;Affaires in Peking.11. H.M.  Charge d&quot;Affaires holds the view that thenormal and legitimate interest of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment in Malaya are so great and so widespread thatthey would greatly resent a decision to exclude Consulsfrom that territory and that their resentment would bemore bitter in view of the usual international practiceoutlined in paragraph 9 above.      He considers that any

public announcement of any decision to exclude ChineseConsuls from Malaya might well cause the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment to break off our negotiations for theestablishment of diplomatic relations and to request thewithdrawal from China of our diplomatic and consular officers.      He also feels that the question of Consularestablishments could not be long postponed after theestablishment of diplomatic relations (even if the Chinesedo not raise this question in the preliminary negotiations)and that if they were told (as opposed to any publicly announced decision) that&apos; their Consuls would be excludedfrom Malaya, they would ultimately demand the withdrawal ofour Consuls from China,  or even go so far as to discontinuediplomatic relations if these had by then been established.H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires also points out that our policy hashitherto &quot;been to keep a foot in the still open Chinese door,in the hope of bringing influences to bear to prevent theformation of a solid 3ir.o-Soviet bloc.     This policy, he feels, would be nullified by the withdrawal of bothConsular posts and diplomatic relations, and to a largeextent delayed &quot;by the withdrawal of the former alone.Indeed, the consequences would be more far reaching, namely to increase Chinese dependence on the Soviet Union and the pace of Sino-Soviet co-operation.     He goes on to express the view that it is possible that,  if we fail to establishdiplomatic relations, the Chinese People&apos;s Government mightnot wish to maintain diplomatic relations with the other western and American countries.     With these considerations in view, he concludes that we should try to maintain all our Consular -posts in China, but that there seems nolikelihood of doing that if we exclude Chinese Consulsfrom Malaya.12. The general question of our relations with china is discussed in a separate paper  (CP. (50) 73), and the implications of any break in relations with the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government have been set forth in Part II thereof.It is also important to note that,  if a decision to excludeChinese Consuls from Malaya resulted in our own Consulshaving to withdraw from China,  it would be necessary togive prior intimation of this to our nationals in thatcountry, to enable them to leave beforehand,  should they wish to do so,13. The Governor of Hong Kong regards anything thatmight jeopardise harmonious relations with whatever ChineseGovernment may be in power as contrary to Hong Kong&apos;interests.      But he doubts whether a decision by HisMajestyTs Government to refuse to accept Consuls in Malayawould, in fact, make either the Chinese People&apos;s government or the local authorities in Kwangtung any less co-operative.On the long term view, he does not think it likely that theChinese People&apos;s Government would be induced to make a major issue of the Hong Kong question &quot;because of any decision to exclude Chinese Consuls.The High Commissioner for the Federation of Malayadoes not consider that the exclusion of Chinese Consuls andthe hostility of the Chinese People&apos;s Government, whichwould almost certainly follow, would have the adverse effects on the attitude of the Chinese community in Malayasuggested in paragraph 8 above.      He considers that in any

choice of loyalties.the great majority of local Chinesewould, now choose loyalty to the Federation Government,because their feeling is directed against Communism bothin Malaya&apos;and China, which has nothing to do with their loyalty to and affection for China itself.      The Chinesewould like to give positive backing to the federation government, but the High Commissioner agrees that they arerestrained from so doing both by doubts as to the outcome of the emergency and fear of an ultimate British withdrawal.Readiness to admit Chinese Consuls would not only providethe Chinese with further grounds for such doubts and fears,but would also expose them to a powerful instrument forcompelling-their allegiance.-    They would, in fact, be left with no choice but to express their loyalty to the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government.     Nor does the High Commissionerthink that the Chinese fellow travellers in Malaya wouldbe stimulated into more active opposition to the government if relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theChinese People&apos;s Government were seriously to deteriorateas a result of the exclusion of Chinese Consuls, whereas the presence of Consuls would certainly encourage them totake a chance.      The High Commissioner is confident that,if a decision were taken to exclude Consuls,  the localChinese would be able to increase and make effective theirpro-Government hold over the majority of their community,who will see in this exclusion concrete evidence of Britishintentions, and who will,  therefore, be more willing togive positive support to the Government against theCommunist bandits.15. The Commissioner-General and the Governor of singapore strongly support these views of the HighC ommi s s i oner.Conclusion and. Recommendation16, The considerations raised by this issue are strongly conflicting and most difficult to reconcile.Whatever decision is taken is bound to have importantconsequences on our policy in the Far East,      In CP, (50) 73it is proposed that in the forthcoming discussions with theUnited States Secretary of State the whole field of our respective relations with China should be reviewed.     Wetherefore recommend that a decision on this specific issueof Chinese Consuls in Malaya should be deferred until these discussions have taken place and their results have been reviewed in relation to this problem,      a delay in reaching a decision will mean a prolongation of the present disquietin the Chinese community in Malaya, but in view of thelarger Issues involved, this is unavoidable,17. In the meantime,  it should, be possible to hold theposition in Peking.      The question of Consuls cannot beraised until both parties have agreed, to exchange Ambassadors.The Central People&apos;s Government have as yet given no indication that they are ready to do so.      Should they signify their readiness, H.M. Charge&apos; &amp;&apos;Affaires has been instructed to take no action and to refer to London,  and it should thus bepossible to ensure that the question of Consuls is not raised,until Ministers have had an opportunity to consider thematter after the talks with the United. States Secretary of state.t^April,  1 95QJ.G.K * G, Y.
