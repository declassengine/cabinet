NATIONALISATION OE PUBLIC WATER supplies memorandum by the Lord President of the council when the Socialisation of Industries Committee discussed, on 21st March,the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals for the nationalisation of water (S.I. (M) (50)2nd Meeting, Minute 1), there was general agreement that if the new waterservices for England and Wales and for Scotland respectively were to be organisedcentrally, the case was pre-eminently one for direct Departmental administration.2. The Secretary of State for Scotland and other Ministers stressed, how-ever, the weight of the opposition which was likely to be encountered from localauthorities to the transfer to state ownership of water undertakings in which theircommunities took great pride, and the Secretary of State has now stated, in CP.(50) 62, his preference for a local system for Scotland : the Minister of Transporttold the Committee that the opposition to the transfer of municipal transport services was stiffening. The Committee felt that everything possible should bedone to meet the views of local authorities, and that there ought at least to beadvisory committees drawn from local authorities, which would be associated withthe local water units and the national water organisation of the Ministry ofHealth. The Committee also agreed that I should submit a memorandum to theCabinet on the issues raised by the proposed transfer of public water supplies to the state as distinct from some form of local authority ownership and operation.3. This is not a matter on which I have formed a final view, but it is certainthat if we decide in favour of direct Departmental administration one of the main points of controversy will be whether local authority ownership in some form orforms would not have been better. The arguments are not so unevenly balancedthat this alternative can be dismissed out of hand, and it was thought that itwould help the Cabinet if they had a statement of the case on each side. &apos;&apos; LabourBelieves in Britain &quot; and &quot; Let Us Win Through Together &quot; did not prejudge the question whether there should be a state or local system of public ownership,and on either view the private undertakings would of course be socialised.4. The arguments for a state system a,re fully set out in the memorandumby the Minister of Health (OP. (50) 54). They are mainly technical, and it willbe accepted that they are strong.   Briefly they are as follows : (a) Engineering surveys have confirmed that drastic amalgamations mustprecede the urgently needed modernisation of our water supplies,which, as far as England and Wales are concerned, are in the hands ofsome 1,200 separate undertakings at present.(&amp;) The natural and hence the most efficient water units would bear no rela-tion to local authority boundaries There are between 50 and 60 suchnatural units in England and Wales. The local government machinerycould still be used by arrangement for collecting the water rate.(c) Experience has shown that the Water Acts of 1945 and 1948 are not agood medium for the amalgamation of undertakings, and that localjealousies and fears of loss of local prestige are a serious handicap38540Printed for the Cabinet.

to voluntary amalgamations.   The procedure for the formation of joint boards by compulsion is complicated, expensive, and slow.(d) The large new schemes that are required and the co-ordinated improve-ment of piped supplies in rural areas are beyond the unaided capacity and financial resources of the water undertakings.5.   The counter arguments are also, I think, strong.   .(a) There is bound to be vigorous opposition from many local authorities tothe severance of yet another local authority service, particularly onewhich is the subject of special local pride and which affects everyindividual so personally; and this would follow electricity, gas, pas-senger transport and hospitals. Labour as well as other Councillorshave become concerned about these developments. The suggestion which the Minister of Health wisely makes of arranging for the localauthorities to collect the water rates would help to meet local feeling,and the local authority advisory committees which he proposes wouldalso help. But feeling against a national scheme is none the less cer-tain to be strong.(b) In the interests of good local government the bias should be against further transfers of services from local authorities to the State.(c) There are hardly any private water companies in Scotland, and in theopinion of the Secretary of State the local authorities have organisedwater supplies efficiently. The case for transference to the state inScotland, therefore, rests almost exclusively upon the desirability of having comparable systems of organisation in the two countries, andin CP. (50) 62 the Secretary of State makes out a case for a localsystem in Scotland which obviously has great weight. If it is accepted,the opposition of local authorities in England and Wales to a state system will be strengthened, and there will be a special onus on theGovernment to prove that it is essential.(d) It cannot be said that as things are the establishment of a new Govern-ment function dealing with water supply is likely to arouse anyenthusiasm on the part of the public. It will be difficult to persuade the man in the street that there are overwhelming technical reasons which make it essential that the water supplies of, say, Norfolk andCumberland shall be run from Whitehall, those of Aberdeen fromEdinburgh and those of Aberystwyth from Cardiff (and ultimatelyLondon). It will be even more difficult to do so if he finds that, as would happen in some cases under the Ministry of Health, his water rates go up to pay for improvements in services elsewhere. unless there is no alternative, it would also be preferable to avoid the appre-appreciable increase in the number of civil servants- not to mention theincrease in the Budget and the National Debt which State ownershipwould entail.6. We have always said that we would not be doctrinaire about forms ofsocialisation and that there was merit in trying different methods according tothe circumstances. If on this occasion we were able to devise a suitable scheme ofsocialisation under local ownership as the Secretary of State suggests for Scot-land -it would be worth consideration, even though joint boards might be involvedin many areas. I confess to some apprehension as to further transfers of localauthority services. I admit on the other hand that in England and Wales thetechnical difficulties are serious, and I recognise that under a local authoritysystem there would have to be radical amalgamations under much stronger centralpowers. Nor, as the Cabinet know, am I in the least enamoured of joint authorities, not excluding the Metropolitan Water Board : nevertheless, one is bound to admit that the people of the large area which the Metropolitan WaterBoard serves seem to be quite happy about the arrangement under which it is responsible for what as the Minister of Health rightly reminds us is a mostimportant public health service.7. There is an overwhelming case for the socialisation of water in theinterests more particularly of the rural areas, but the pros and cons of state asagainst some form of local authority ownership are nicely balanced, and I am anxious that the Cabinet should not decide upon a state system without taking
full account of the arguments for socialisation under local ownership. If wecome to the conclusion that, provided the technical difficulties can be met ade-adequately, a local system would be preferable, the Cabinet may think it right before making up their minds finally to refer the matter back to the Socialisation ofIndustries Committee for further examination of the practicability of localschemes with considerably strengthened central powers which should provide forbroadly comparable arrangements in England and Scotland. By this means we might be able to meet the strong case which the Minister of Health makes for a radical reform of the present system and at the same time avoid the serious difficulties which a state scheme would involve.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council. S.W. 1,Sth April, 1950.
