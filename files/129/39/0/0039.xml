0S DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPEBTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT    ^,----------,------    .&quot; Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950..... - . 3* secret Copy No. O 4CP. (50) 8927th April, 1950jitCABINETPREPARATION OF LEGISLATION FOR THE 1950-51 session memorandum by the Lord President op the council the Committee on Future Legislation have considered, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned and with Parliamentary Counsel, what preparatory workon legislation for the 1950-51 Session should now be put in hand, subject to prior approval of policy in each case by the Cabinet or an appropriate CabinetCommittee. This is without prejudice to the decisions which the Cabinet may take later in the year about the final content of the King&apos;s speech on the openingof Parliament. We have assumed that the Session will run from the autumn of1950 until the summer of 1951.2. In recent years it has been customary for the Committee&apos;s proposals tothe Cabinet to cover only major and medium-sized Bills. In view, however, ofthe current Parliamentary situation we felt that the Cabinet might wish toexamine the provisional 1950-51 legislative programme as a whole. The Annexaccordingly covers all proposed Bills, large and small.3,   We would draw the attention of the Cabinet to the following matters : (a) A Supplies and Services Bill may be required, and other Bills on relatedtopics. Drafting is proceeding, but the inclusion of these items inthe programme will depend on the final decision reached by the Cabineton the manner in which emergency powers shall be continued in force,a matter which they recently remitted to the Lord presidents committee for detailed consideration (CM. (50) 16th Conclusions,Minute 3, L.P. (50) 21 and L.P. (50) 4th Meeting, Minute 2).(b) The attention of the Committee was drawn to the desirability of takingmeasures to simplify distribution and marketing, and so to reducethe general level of prices. A Committee of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Minister of Town and Country Planning is now engaged in a detailed examination of this field, which may result in further legislative proposals.. (c) The provisional programme does not include any Bill to implement therecommendations contained in the second report of the OakseyCommittee on police pay and conditions of service. It has been assumed that in present circumstances it will not be desirable tointroduce highly controversial legislation of this character.(d) The Court-Martial Procedure Bill raises some difficult points of policyand it is by no means clear that legislation on the subject would emerge from the present Parliament in what we would regard as asuitable form. The Minister of Defence and the Service departments have, however, asked for its inclusion in the programme, and therewill certainly be pressure in Parliament for the introduction of theBill.(e) The inclusion of a Water Bill in the final programme will depend onthe decisions reached by the Cabinet on memoranda now before them(OP. (50) 54, 62 and 64).38639 B
(/) The policy underlying the Fertiliser Subsidies Bill (Group IV) hasalready been approved by the Cabinet (CM. (50) 14th Conclusions,Minute 5); and in view of the urgency of passing this legislation theLegislation Committee may agree to the introduction of the Billduring the current Session.(g) The Comptroller and Auditor-General Bill would not be introduceduntil a final decision had been reached on increasing Civil Servicesalaries in accordance with the Chorley Committee recommendations.At the same time the Treasury are anxious to proceed with thepreparation of the Bill and to reserve a place for it in the programme.(h) It will probably be practicable to undertake a more ambitious programmeof consolidation than is shown in Group V of the provisional programme.(i) We had Some doubt about the inclusion of the Intestate Succession(Scotland) Bill in the programme. During Parliamentary discussionof the Adoption Bill, 1949, there was strong pressure for the modification of the law of succession in Scotland. A Committee underthe chairmanship of a Judge of the Court of Session is now at workand, when it has reported, the possibility of early legislation will haveto be examined. In these circumstances the Committee added the Billto Group VI of the programme.(j) The Committee were informed of the possible need to introduce legisla-tion during the 1950-51 Session to amend the Town and country planning Acts and to provide for the restoration of iron-ore workings.Two Bills have accordingly been included in Group VI of the pro-visional programme.4. Lastly we wish to stress the following points connected with the prepara-tion of legislation for the 1950-51 Session : (i) We must provide for having a substantial number of Bills ready for introduction as soon as the new Session begins. The bulk of the bills in the programme should be ready for introduction before the christmas Recess.(ii) Too heavy a burden of legislation should not be placed on any one department. ,(iii) The approval of this memorandum by the Cabinet does not authorise a Minister to anticipate the King&apos;s speech on the opening of Parlia-ment by promising that a Bill mentioned in the memorandum will beintroduced next Session.5.   To sum up , the Cabinet are invited (1) To agree that, pending the formulation of a final legislative programme for the 1950-51 Session, Parliamentary Counsel should proceed withthe preparation of the Bills listed in the Annex under Categories Ito V, after policy approval has been secured in each case.(2) To authorise the Future Legislation Committee to review from time totime the progress made with the preparation of legislation for the1950-51 Session and to make such minor adjustments in the provisional programme as may seem desirable.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,27th April, 1950.
