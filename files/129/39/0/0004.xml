(SO) 5429th March, 1950CABINETNATIONALISATION OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES (ENGLANDAND WALES)Memorandum by the Minister of health i seek the approval of my colleagues to the early introduction of a Bill forthe nationalisation of water supplies.General Considerations2.   The main reasons for early nationalisation of water supplies are (a) the urgent need for a very substantial reduction of the number of statutory water undertakings in England and Wales, so that existing resources and the many large new schemes that must be designed and carried out during the next few years may be properly co-ordinated;(b) the early completion of the policy of improving piped supplies in rural areas.3. My Engineering Inspectors have been making detailed surveys of thedemands and resources of large areas with common interests, and the surveysalready completed cover the bulk of the population. The situation they revealis that large new sources will be needed within a few years for the Greater london area and for many of the industrial areas, and that extensive rural schemes arerequired, but that well-planned development of the new works and the co-ordinateduse of existing and new resources will not be feasible without widespread joint action between undertakings. They indicate, too, that the co-ordinated use of resources would sometimes postpone capital expenditure on new works. Atpresent, there are some 1,200 water undertakings in England and Wales, withlimits of supply which have little or no regard to the geological and engineeringconsiderations which should govern the distribution of water supplies. Manyof the undertakings are small bodies, with part-time staffs and resourcesinsufficient for modern requirements. The surveys have confirmed throughoutthe country that drastic amalgamations must precede any proposals for the modernisation of our system of water supplies.4. Experience has already shown that the Water Acts, 1945 and 1948,are not a good medium for the amalgamation of undertakings. The con-sideration by the responsible local authorities of the published reports on the completed surveys is proving that in only very few instances are the water undertakings themselves likely to promote orders for this purpose. Those largerauthorities that must necessarily be the nuclei of new undertakings are usuallyloth to lose the full control of their undertakings; smaller authorities fear thattheir interests may be swamped if they become partners in joint boards, or ifthey co-operate in other directions with their more powerful neighbours; watercompanies, which still supply about 25 per cent, of the population, will generallynot agree to the acquisition of their undertakings by local authorities, a necessary preliminary to the formation of joint boards; and local jealousies and fear of loss of local prestige have considerable influence on the decisions reached locally,even though joint schemes are desirable in the public interest.38497 b6Z
5. To give one or two examples. The needs of a large part of Cornwall,both urban and rural, where supplies are notoriously bad, can only be met by theconstruction and joint use by a number of authorities of a large impoundingreservoir. This project was first mooted at least 20 years ago, and, although urgedagain after a Departmental survey 3 years ago, there is little prospect of agreedjoint action. Adjoining authorities in Leicestershire and Staffordshire(including Leicester itself) are in urgent need of new supplies, which can only be effectively secured by the joint development of an impounding reservoir, for whichsuitable sites in the Midlands are now very scarce. Although an attempt byLeicester to obtain powers to exploit one of these sources for its own use was rejected by Parliament a year or two ago, on the ground that the source should be developed jointly by the authorities in need, there is little disposition amongstsome of the authorities to work together. The position is much the same inNorthumberland, where joint action between authorities is essential. The water undertakers for Newcastle and Gateshead are a Company, and there seems little prospect of reasonable arrangements being made. These are just examples of a situation which is prevalent throughout the country.6. It is true that I am empowered by the Water Acts to form joint boardsby compulsion, but the procedure is involved and expensive because of the safe-guards provided by the Act. It necessitates, in each case, lengthy preliminaryconsultations with the local authorities, in order that the financial and othereffects may be closely estimated, a public inquiry into the draft order, if thereare objections, and consideration by a Joint Select Committee of both Housesif objections are pursued after the order has been made. Parliamentary Agents,counsel and expert witnesses must be retained by the authorities for the local inquiry and by the authorities and by me for the proceedings before the joint select Committee. Each opposed order may well be, in effect, an opposed PrivateBill, with comparable expenditure to that incurred in Private Bill procedure.7. My recent experience of the compulsory formation of joint boards foran area in Northamptonshire and for the Isle of Wight has shown that evenin simple cases, where the areas are relatively small and the majority of theauthorities support the proposals, a decision cannot be reached for many months,and that the proceedings are extremely costly. It would take many years todeal, under this procedure, with the hundreds of undertakings that ought, inthe public interest, to be merged into larger bodies. Apart from the time factor,the cost would be an unreasonable burden on every affected interest.8. Co-ordination is particularly necessary for rural water supplies if weare to move progressively to the fulfilment of the Government s policy of adequate supplies for all rural areas. In many rural areas where needs are most acute the only hope of effective supplies is in the exploitation of somelarge new source for a number of areas. Although since 1945 substantial headwayhas been made with the provision of piped supplies in the rural areas, the schemes already approved are on the whole the more simple and straightforward schemesresulting from early planning by the more active authorities. The position isnow being reached where the more difficult and expensive schemes, involving such questions as joint action with other authorities in the exploitation of new sources,are still in various stages of preliminary planning. There is the further problemthat the authorities responsible for the preparation of rural schemes have usuallyhad no experience of the affairs of large water undertakings. In many instances,they are dependent upon part-time staff surveyors who are not water engineers and clerks with other posts or in private practice. The technical side of thework (which would often be well within the competence of the water engineerof a medium borough) has, therefore, to be undertaken by a small body of consult-ing engineers who are overloaded with work, and on the administrative sidesuch matters as negotiations with other authorities, the preparation of ordersfor new powers and the work connected with the acquisition of land are boundto be seriously delayed when part-time staffs are responsible. Moreover, themanagement of the new undertakings, when schemes are completed, will giverise to difficult problems in many rural districts unless competent full-timetechnical staff are available, but the employment of senior full-time staff would,in most cases, be a waste of man-power, unless the undertakings are merged with one another. The proper solution is the formation of larger areas so that the staffs may be both competent to prepare and manage schemes and fully employed.
9. It is clear that only nationalisation of water supplies is likely to achieve the widespread co-ordination Of supplies which is essential if the fullest use is to be made of our water&apos;resources arid if needs, both urban and rural, are to bemet within any reasonable time. Not only is nationalisation a ready means ofsecuring that competent local staffs are adequately employed, thus avoiding theuse of consultants on comparatively minor works, but it would also have the addedtechnical advantage that a good deal of the more difficult work, such as the design-ing of reservoirs, could be handled by a small central pool of salaried engineersinstead of by consulting engineers;Proposed Organisation10. I feel that a Civil Service organisation is needed to administer a national-ised water undertaking, for the following reasons. Water undertakers can and dosupply water for non-domestic purposes and this is of great importance for indus-trial development. To some extent, therefore, they are trading concerns, but their main function is to carry out the essential health service of supplying wholesomewater for domestic use, and this public health aspect differentiates water supplies from gas and electricity supplies. It is significant of the importance that parliament has attached to the public health aspect of water supplies and to theneed for conservation of our water resources that wider duties and powers ofcontrol have since 1875 been progressively placed by the legislature on a Ministeranswerable to Parliament. The present position is that the Minister is chargedwith the specific duty &quot; to promote the conservation and proper use of waterresources and the provision of water supplies in England and Wales and to securethe effective execution by water undertakers, under his control and direction, ofa national policy relating to water.&quot; His direct approval is required to theabstraction of water from underground for public supply purposes and he is nowable to authorise the abstraction of water from rivers or streams by order, subjectto special parliamentary procedure in case of objection: this authority could,before 1945, be obtained only by a special Act of Parliament. He has wide powers of default in that he may make a default order where a statutory waterundertaker (local authority, board or company) fail to give an adequate supply to any part of their area and, if the order is not complied with, may take over thefunctions himself. I should expect neither Parliament nor public opinion tobe satisfied with any lessening of the Ministers powers and duties, and theirexercise would need so close a control over water administration as to makeadministration through central and area boards extremely difficult if notimpracticable. On the other hand, if such boards were formed then, unless theMinisters powers and duties were maintained, non-elected bodies would be givenwider public health functions than have ever been conferred on elected publichealth authorities.11. There is this further consideration. The surveys to which reference has been made show that, looking to the need for conserving and properly usingour water resources by their joint use where community of interest arises, and theneed for absorption or amalgamation of small ineffective units, the country fallsnaturally into between &quot;50 and 60 units. These 50 to 60 units should formthe lowest tier in any new organisation. A good deal of independence couldbe given to them. The general day-to-day running of the undertakings can beleft to the staff of the units, subject to directions from above. Under these arrangements, there would be no room for any tier between the unit and the head-quarter organisation, and area boards would be wasteful in the extreme andfruitful of friction.12. It seems to me therefore that, on nationalisation, a Civil Serviceorganisation is necessary for the adequate control of the service by a Minister and,through him, by Parliament. The health aspect would suggest that that minister should be the Minister of Health.13. I propose that the country should be divided into 50 to 60 watersupply districts; that the service in these districts should be managed and con-trolled by permanent administrative, technical and financial officers, who wouldbe largely recruited in the first instance from the existing undertakings; andthat the district staffs should be responsible to me, through the headquarters staff.The local staffs of the 50 to 60 units would be responsible for the day-to-daywork in their districts, including relations with householders, traders and con-tractors, the preparation of annual programmes of new work, and the design and38497 n9
execution of new works of a simple character, such as mains, water towers,boreholes, &amp;c. The headquarters staff would be responsible for the general con-trol of policy, the approval and co-ordination of local programmes, the selection of major new sources, particularly those capable of serving more than one watersupply district, the planning and design of major schemes and such matters ascentral purchase of stores and materials, labour relations, welfare and redeploy-ment of staffs.14. The arrangements referred to in the previous paragraph would applyto a Civil Service organisation, whether it is in the normal Departmental form orwhether it is in a non-Departmental form under which a Board or commission is made directly responsible for administration under control by the Minister.It seems to me likely that, whether the organisation is Departmental on non-Departmental, Parliament will show a keen interest in all aspects in the early stages but confine itself to the wider policy aspects as the new organisation settlesdown; and I doubt whether, for water supplies, it will be possible to lay downgeneral principles with sufficient precision to make such a non-Departmentalarrangement work smoothly.15. About one half of the local authorities are not themselves water under-takers, their areas being supplied by other local authorities, or by boards or companies. Those local authorities who have undertakings will no doubt stronglyoppose their transfer to the State, for much the same reasons as they now resistfusion into joint boards. I have considered the suggestions made by my colleagues on the Socialisation of Industries Committee (S.I. (M) (50) 2nd Meeting, Minute 1)that local authorities should be associated in a purely advisory capacity with thenew organisation, both at the centre and at the level of the 50 to 60 administrative units, and I think that there would be advantage in such arrangements. At thecentre, there is already a statutory advisory body- the Central Advisory WaterCommittee -representative of all interests concerned with the conservation and use of water. This body could easily be expanded to have more local authorityrepresentation. For each of the 50 to 60 administrative units there might beappointed a small advisory body comprising local authority representatives, whowould meet the staff of the unit at regular intervals for exchange of information and views. On the average, there would be 30 local authorities to each unit,and a representative from each authority would give too cumbersome a body, butit should be practicable for a smaller body representative of the various types of authority to be appointed by the Minister from nominations of the authorities or of their associations. If my colleagues concur, I would propose to includethese arrangements among the matters to be discussed with the local authority associations on the Bill.Finance16. I propose that the arrangements for the transfer of the undertakings&apos;properties, outstanding debt, &amp;c, and compensation should correspond broadlywith those approved for the gas and electricity undertakings. It will beremembered that local authority undertakings were taken over without paymentother than the taking over of outstanding loan debts and some compensation forseverance. The compensation for the company undertakings was in the formof stock, the amount being based on the market value of the companies&apos; stocksas quoted on the Stock Exchange. Where there were no quotations, and agree-ment between the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the stockholders&apos; representa-tives could not be reached, the compensation was to be determined by arbitration.17. An accurate estimate of the debt that would be taken over and thecompensation that would be payable to companies is not possible without discussionwith the interests concerned, but the following figures give an approximate ideaof the amounts that would be involved. The net outstanding debt of localauthorities in respect of water supply is of the order of  150 million, and thetotal annual expenditure is about  32 million, including  10 million loan charges.Expenditure exceeds income by about  2 million. Some of the deficit is accountedfor by the fact that not all water undertakings charge water rates for domesticsupplies, while in other instances water rates have been kept artificially low.At a rough estimate, the market value of the total capital of water companies isof the order of  70 million. Full information on the total net profits and totaltransfers to reserve and contingency funds is not readily available at the moment,
but it is known that the bulk of the companies have been able to pay maximumdividends for many years without seriously depleting their reserves.18. I should not expect that the local authorities could make out a case for substantial compensation for severance. The larger authorities usually haveseparate water departments which would be taken over as a whole; and most ofthe smaller authorities, including in particular the rural district councils, shouldgain financially by the transfer of their outstanding debt and other liabilities andshould thus have no claims. But an accurate estimate cannot be made until thequestion has been discussed with the local authority associations.19. Generally, it may be said that most undertakings serving urban areas are in a healthy financial position; on the other hand the majority of the rural district councils with water undertakings levy deficiency rates, largely because ofthe capital expenditure incurred just before the war and since. In these areas,the deficits will tend to disappear as loans mature, since large new developmentsare unlikely once the schemes now under consideration are completed. If need be,a very small addition to the existing water rates charged in urban areas wouldwipe out any deficit in the rural areas; but the deficits on the outstanding schemesfor bringing piped supplies to the latter areas, in conformity with the Govern-menfs policy for the increase of agricultural production, are likely to be high,and it may be necessary, in the interest of the agricultural economy, to recognisethat these schemes cannot be self-supporting in the first instance. I consider that my aim should be ultimately to reach the position where uniform water ratesand charges can be applied throughout the country and the service is self-supporting.20. For a Departmental organisation which, subject to specific grants, isself-supporting, it will be necessary to give special consideration to the questionwhether the method of providing finance for the capital programme by annualvotes is satisfactory. Clearly, it will be necessary to give the organisationborrowing powers and all practicable steps should be taken to avoid a situationwhere some unexpected expenditure, for example to meet drought conditions,involved the machinery of supplementary estimate.Man-power21. The total of the full-time staffs employed by statutory water undertakingsis about 30,000, of whom 5,000 are engineers and other salaried staffs. In addition,there are part-time staffs, mainly but not wholly employed on water supply; their numbers are not yet known. I propose that these staffs shall be transferred to mewith the undertakings, with provisions similar to those of the Gas and ElectricityActs for compensation to employees who are not permanently retained or are notoffered posts comparable to those which they now hold. I expect that my proposals will eventually lead to a considerable saving of man-power. In the closely-developed areas of the West Riding, the Midlands, Lancashire and greater london, the larger undertakings have senior technical and other staffs who couldassume wider responsibilities with the help of more junior staff. Amalgamationsin these areas should throw up a considerable body of all grades available for employment elsewhere. A body of engineers at headquarters capable of designingmost of the major engineering works and the supervision by permanent employees of the construction of works should, in the long run, be more economical than theemployment of consulting engineers. Inhere will be considerable room for economy in the rural areas, where, under the present system, permanent staffs will have tobe employed by the individual authorities in the interests of public health, toensure efficient control and management of the large new undertakings that arebeing established under the grants scheme, but the undertakings are mostly notlarge enough to afford whole-time employment to water engineers and othertechnicians.22. I propose to avoid the setting up of an expensive organisation for thecollection of rates and charges by providing that the work can be done, where this is suitable, by the local authorities on an agency basis, through their organisation for the collection of the general rates.A.
