TOP SECRET Copy&quot; No.    32CP. (50) 8623th April, 1950CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report(OP. (50) 47).Appended to the Report is a note by the Economic Section on Current trends in the United States economy.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,28th April, 1950.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the total working population decreased by 27,000 in February 1950. Outflownormally exceeds inflow during this month. There was a reduction of 4,000 inthe size of the Armed Forces and an increase of 2,000 in the number of men andwomen on release leave. Unemployment fell by 12,000 during the month and thetotal number in civil employment fell by 13,000 (10,000 men and 3,000 women).2. The total in manufacturing industries increased during February by5,000. There were increases of 3,000 in textiles and 2,000 in clothing. A decline of 5,000 in food, drink and tobacco was offset by small increases in metals,engineering and vehicles and in certain other manufacturing industries.3. There was a decrease of 9,000 in the number of persons employed in building and contracting, bringing the total down to 1,462,000, the same number asat the end of February 1949. There was a fall of 3,000 in the numbers engagedin professional, financial and miscellaneous services and reductions in coalmining,in distribution, and in public administration.38592 bPrinted by the Cabinet.

4. The number of persons registered as unemployed declined from 372,800at 13th February to 347,300 at 13th March. The March figure represents a rateof about 1 - 7 per cent, of the total number of employees insured under the national insurance Schemes. The figure for 14th March, 1949, was 340,400. Unemploy-ment in the Development Areas fell from 144,400 at 13th February to 138,900at 13th March, the reduction being shared by all areas except West Cumberlandand South Merseyside, where there were increases of 94 and 31 respectively.Allowing for changes in the districts designated as Development Areas duringthe last twelve months, the numbers unemployed in these Areas have not beensignificantly different in the first three months of 1950 from those recorded in thefirst three months of 1949.II. ProductionIndex of Industrial Production5. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) rose further to 142in February, 12 points above the figure for February 1949, thus maintaining thehigher rate of increase achieved in December and January. For manufacturing industries the index rose in February to 147, 14 points above the index for february 1949.Interim Index of Industrial Production(Average 1946 ^ 100)1948-49 1949-50    Points increaseMarch and April ....May and JuneJuly and August ...September to NovemberDecember and january february    ......121 .            128.. ,-f- 6120 132 +12111 118 -H 7126 135 4-9123 133 +10130 142 +126. Oh the basis of the information so far received, the index for all industries for March is expected to be about 142-143, against 131 for March last year. Theexpansion in the output of vehicles particularly passenger cars which beganlast year is one of the most important factors in sustaining the relatively high levels of production achieved in recent months.Coal7. During the first quarter of this year output of deep-mined coal was1 -1 per cent, greater than in the first quarter of 1949. The number of face-workerswas 2-0 per cent. less. The average number of shifts worked per face-worker was almost exactly the same as last year, and the slightly higher rate of output thisyear was obtained entirely from an increase of 3-4 per cent, in output per man-(shift at the face. The number of workers on the books continues to decline andthe number at the face has fallen from 294,000 at the beginning of the year to290,200 at 8th April.Steel8. The output of steel ingots and castings rose to ia new record of 330,000tons a week in March. Total production in the first 14 weeks of this year was,5-2 per cent, greater than in the corresponding period of 1949. For the sameperiod output of pig-iron was 4 - 0 per cent, greater than a year ago.Stocks of steel at producers&apos; works and at British Iron and Steel Corporationstockyards amounted to 1 - 26 million tons at the end of February. This comparedwith 1-00 million tons at February 1949 and 0-75 million tons at February 1948.Textiles9. Compared with February 1949, deliveries of cotton yarn, rayon yarn,worsted yarn and woven cotton and rayon fabrics all showed a greater rise thanthe increase between 1948 and 1949. Production of woven wool fabrics, however,was only slightly greater than in February 1949. There was a further improve-ment in March in the production of cotton yarn, which was 8 - 5 per cent, greaterthan in March 1949.
Motor vehicles10. The record output of passenger cars in February was; slightlybettered in March. Production rose from a weekly average of 10,174 in february to 10,204 in March, and the number produced for export from a weekly averageof 8,155 to 8,238. The number produced for the home market fell slightly. Overthe whole of the first quarter of 1950, production has averaged 10,105 per weekcompared with 7,929 per week over the whole of 1949; the number produced forexport averaged 8,129 per week, compared with 5,234 in 1949, while the numberproduced for the home market averaged 1,977 compared with 2,694 in 1949.11. In the first three months of 1950, exports of new cars amountedin total value to  27 - 6 million, compared with  14 - 7 million in the first threemonths of 1949. There has been a particularly large rise in exports to Canada,which amounted to  4 - 8 million in the quarter, compared with  1 -1 million in thefirst quarter of 1949. Exports to the United States amounted to&apos; 0-7 million,in the first quarter 1950, compared with  0-6 million in the first quarter 1949.12. Production of commercial vehicles rose from a weekly average of 5,158in February to 5,269 in March and the number produced for export rose from 3,298(weekly average) to 3,410, thus accounting for the-whole increase in production.Over the first quarter production has averaged 5,101 per week, compared with,161 in 1949; production for export averaged 3,253 per week, against 2,053 in1949, while production for the home market fell from 2,108 in 1949 to 1,848.Merchant shipbuilding13. The renewed flow of orders for merchant ships which began in Februaryhas continued in March. A net total of 176,000 gross tons was licensed, comparedwith 171,000 in February. The net total for the first quarter was 380,000 grosstons, more than the total for the whole of 1949 (331,000). The tonnage under construction rose slightly in March (from 1,803,000 to 1,805,000 gross tons), thusending a decline which had been going on since las.t September; the figure is,however, distinctly below that for the corresponding date in 1949 (1,930,000 grosstons).14. The new orders in March, which were again mostly for tankers, wereshared about equally between United Kingdom and overseas owners. Orders are continuing to be placed in April, but so far rather more slowly than in the two preceding months.15. The tonnage of vessels undergoing repair and conversion, which hadrecovered somewhat in January from the low level to which it had fallen at theend of 1949, is now falling again. At the end of March it amounted to 2-51million tons, compared with 2-61 at the end of February, 2-44 at the end ofDecember 1949, and 2-63 at the end of March 1949.III.-Building16. The number of new permanent houses (including aluminium houses) com-pleted in Great Britain rose from 14,069 in February to 19,385 in March. Overthe first quarter of 1950 the number of houses completed was 47,810, and thenumber whose construction was begun was almost the same. The number under construction therefore remained practically constant; at the end of March it was195,439. The number of new houses for which contracts were let during the quarter was 46,123, a little below the number started.IY.-External Trade17. The value of United Kingdom exports reached a new record ( 184-4 million) in March. This followed a much lower figure for February ( 155-8million), but the total for the first three months of the 3&apos;ear showed a sharp increase over the previous quarter&apos;s figure,. which was itself higher than any of the first
three quarters of 1949. Only a small part of the rise was due to higher prices,the main factor being an increase in the volume of exports which, in the first quarter, was about 7 per cent, above that of the previous quarter. Re-exports have also gone up.18. The value of imports also reached a new record in March ( 221-3 million). For the first three months taken together, however, imports were only alittle higher than in the preceding quarter. Import prices have been rising, andthe higher value figure for the first quarter represents a slightly smaller volume ofgoods than that imported in the last quarter of 1949.19. The sharp rise in exports and re-exports, combined with a much smallerincrease in the value of imports, has reduced the visible adverse balance of trademuch below the average level of 1949. In the first quarter of 1950 the excess ofimports (c.i.f.) over the total of exports and re-exports (f.o.b.) was at a level littleabove that of the first quarter of 1949.Visible balance of traded)  million1949 1st Quarter       ......      ... - 62-92nd ......... -134-23rd ......... -126-64th ......... -105-81950 1st ......... - 70-1(*) Exports plus re-exports (both f.o.b.) minus imports (c.i.f.).20. The broad groups of exports, metal goods, textiles and other manu-factures have each increased sharply since the last quarter of 1949. Exports of metal goods have risen to new high levels, vehicles having shown a particularlysteep rise, but exports of textiles have not quite recovered the level they had reached in the first quarter of 1949.21. Exports to the United States and to Canada rose sharply in March,in the case of Canada to a record high level. Expressed in dollars, however, ourearnings from these exports have not recovered the level they had reached in eariy1949, before devaluation cut the dollar value of the pound. The quarterly figures show the extent of the fall and recovery.United Kingdom Exports to North AmericaMonthly averages	To United States		To Canada		  million	$ million equivalent	  million	$ million equivalent Canadian1949 1st Quarter	5-3	21-2	6-6	26-72nd	3-3	13-4	6-6	26-53rd	3-7	151	6-2	25-24th	6-7	18-7	7-2	22-01950 1st	6-8	18-9	8-5	26-3Y. Balance of Payments22. As announced on 4th April, there was a net gold and dollar surplus of140 million in the first quarter of 1950 (ending on 31st March). E.R.P. assistancetotalled 1229 million, and the equivalent of United States $27 million was drawn on the Canadian Credit.   The gold and dollar reserves therefore rose by $296

Signs of sterling shortage have appeared in some european countries, in spite of our high rate of import from them; this make sit less likely that we shall have to make substantial gold payments to non-dollar countries in the immediate future.YI. Prices and FinanceImport and Export Prices23. The index of import prices rose from 125 in February to 128 in March(1947 = 100), while the index of export prices rose from 116 to 118. In September1949, just before devaluation, these indices stood at 110 and 113 respectively.Wholesale Prices O24. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices for March was 242(1938 ^ 100), the same as in February. The rounding to the nearest whole numberconceals a small rise, due mainly to increases in prices of cotton, wool and othertextiles. The rise in wholesale prices generally, which was sharp in the months immediately following devaluation, has now become much more gentle.Retail Prices25. The index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) remained at 113 in March.It has stood at this figdre since December, but the rounding-off to a whole numberhas concealed a continuing gentle rise; thus to the first decimal point the February
figure was 113-2, the March figure 113-5. The rise between February and Marchwas mainly due to a rise in the food index (from 120-6 to 121-3), resulting fromincreases in the prices of potatoes, other fresh vegetables (tomatoes, cabbages andonions) and apples.Bank Deposits26. The total deposits of the London Clearing Banks fell to  5,783 million in March, compared with  5,841 million in February and  5,815 million in Marchof last year. It is the first time in the post-war period that bank deposits haveshown a fall compared with the corresponding date a year earlier.Savings27. Additions to small savings in March were less than withdrawals. InJanuary and February there were net weekly increases in national savings of 2-38 and  0-01 million respectively, while in March there was a net decreaseaveraging  1 -14 million per week. A falling-off is normal at this time of theyear, but in each of the first three months of 1950 net savings have been smaller than in the corresponding month of 1949. Thus in March 1949 there was a net increase averaging  1-31 million per week, against the net decrease of  1-14million this year.YII.-Wage Rates28. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)which rose to 110 in January, was unchanged in February and March.29. During March there was an increase of approximately  27,500 in the weekly full-time wages of about 149,000 workpeople. This compares with anincrease of  178,000 in February and of  106,000 in January, and is the smallestmonthly increase since August 1949. The principal increases affected workers inthe furniture manufacturing industry, heating, ventilating and domesticengineering and the jute industry. Weekly remuneration in the furniture manu-facturing industry was raised owing partly to an increase under the cost-of-livingbonus and partly to an increase in the normal working hours from 44 to 45.VIII.-European Recovery ProgrammeAllocation of Aid30. According to Economic Co-operation Administration figures, the totalallocation to Western European countries in the first two years of Marshall Aidended 31st March, 1950, was f8,726 - 5 million of which the United Kingdom sharewas $2,391 - 4 million.31. &apos; The main commodities included in the above figure for the UnitedKingdom were : % millionWheat and wheat flour     ...      ...... 508-4Petroleum products............ 262-cotton.................. 221-0Tobacco        ............... 141-4Sugar  ................... 134-4Copper         ...      ...      ...      ...... 100-8Aluminium    ..........      ...      ... 99-4Timber         ............... 90-4Meat.................. 75-6Pulp and paper       ............ 71-4Dairy products       ...      ...      ...      ... 69-0Industrial machinery         ......      ... 67-0Chemicals      .........      ...      ... 64-9Zinc    ...      ...      ............ 58-iron and steel products     ......... 51-7The 1950-51 E.R.P. Appropriation32. The Foreign Aid Authorisation Bill was passed by the United StatesHouse of Representatives on 31st March, 1950. Though an amendment to replace11,000 million of E.R.P. aid by an equivalent value of surplus United States
agricultural commodities was defeated, a cut of $250 million from the total appro-priation of  2,950 million of new funds asked for by the Economic Co-operation administration was approved. The Bill now goes to the United States Senate,after which a corresponding Appropriations Bill will have to pass both Houses.European Payments33. Discussions between United Kingdom officials and representatives of theEconomic Co-operation Administration and of national delegations to the Organi-sation for European Economic Co-operation on the United Kingdom proposals fora European Payments Union are still proceeding in Paris.34. The Anglo-French Economic Committee on 30th March agreed to proposeto O.E.E.C. the cancellation of French bilateral drawing rights on the UnitedKingdom, including those carried forward from 1948-49, amounting to $93million approximately; this was approved by the Council of O.E.E.C. on 21stApril, 1950. It was also agreed that the United Kingdom and French delegations to O.E.E.C. would support the draft Protocol now before the Organisationamending the Intra-European Payments Agreement and making possible the revision of multilateral drawing rights, and that when the Protocol became effec-tive the French would propose a reduction of $15 million of the $27 millionmultilateral drawing rights subscribed by the United Kingdom in respect ofFrance.35. For the period July 1949 to March 1950 (inclusive) bilateral drawingrights to a total of $95-57 million and multilateral drawing rights to the extentof $ 11-17 million were exercised by other participants on the United kingdom under the existing payments agreement. All the bilateral drawing rights establishedby the United Kingdom have now been used except those established in favour ofFrance, which will be cancelled as stated above.36. Of the drawing rights and loan totalling $102 million available to her from Belgium, the United Kingdom has since July 1949 used $51-62 million (i.e.,no change since the last Report).APPENDIXCurrent Trends in the United States Economy(Note prepared by the Economic Section)The improvement in aggregate demand which developed in the latter partof 1949 became more marked in the first quarter of 1950. Preliminary estimatesindicate a rise in the gross national product of $3 billion at annual rates, ormore than 1 per cent, over the last quarter of 1949. Since prices tended to remainstable overall this represents an increase in real terms in the output of goods and services.2. Personal consumption reached the high level of 1948 (and exceeded itin real terms) mainly as a result of increased purchases of durable goods, includingcars. Estimates of the other components of aggregate demand for the first quarterof 1950 are not yet available, but there are sufficient indications to show theirtrend. Private and public construction increased (allowing for a seasonal adjust-ment), while business stocks probably remained unchanged or declined compara-tively little compared with the substantial decline in 1949. These favourablechanges more than offset a fall in business investment in durable equipment anda marked decline in the export surplus. Government purchases of goods and services, other than on construction activities, probably remained unchanged.3. Present indications suggest that these conflicting trends are likely to persist and that, for the immediate future at least, the favourable factors willremain dominant and the rising trend in activity will continue.
4. Personal incomes are running at a record level, mainly owing to thespecial distribution of insurance dividends to veterans between January and Junethis year, and there are prospects of a continuing rise in consumption expenditure.Some slackening in demand for non-durable goods has been noticeablelately, but the demand for durable goods-probably influenced by the expanding housing programme is still increasing. The demand for cars isbreaking all records despite frequent predictions of a decline, though it is shiftingtowards smaller types of cars. The volume of new construction contract awards of all types, but mainly of housing contracts, is rising steeply, indicating a similarrise in construction activity in the near future.5. As a result of these influences the economy is at present enjoying a morethan seasonal stimulus. Industrial production has improved rapidly after thesetback of the prolonged coal strike and the Federal Reserve index has recoveredmore than two-thirds of the decline from the 1948 peak level. Some evidence ofthe reviving confidence of business may be seen in a recent survey of plans for investment in durable equipment during the current year. This survey indicates that the expected fall in this form of investment will be significantly smaller than was projected when the last survey was made in November, 11 per cent, insteadof 15 per cent, below the 1949 level. If the present revival of activity persists,this decline may be even further reduced, but it is ominous that the drop isexpected to be concentrated in the last half of the year, indicating that durableequipment investment is still set in decline following the post-war expansion.This trend constitutes the most serious threat to the stability of the economy.6.   The other deflationary influence in the economy is the declining trend inthe export surplus, and this trend is also likely to be accelerated during the latter half of the year when European Co-operation Administration aid is cut, andto the extent that other countries succeed in increasing their exports to the United&apos;States (without offsetting increases in their imports).7. The Government proposals for the 1950-51 budget provide for no markedchanges in expenditure in goods and services for domestic purposes. Theproposals are, however, currently under debate in Congress. Some sections in congress are pressing for cuts in expenditure to reduce the budget deficit, butthere seems little likelihood of severe cuts in an election year (except, possibly,further reductions in foreign aid).8. Although it is possible to feel reasonably confident that this balance of forces in the economy will support a continuance of the present revival of activity,at least for the next few months, there is no evidence of that considerable expan-sion in demand which is necessary to reduce substantially the present level ofunemployment and to absorb the increasing labour force. Unemployment nowexceeds 4 million, nearly 7 per cent, of the labour force. Although there willprobably be some decrease during the early summer, the permanent labour force will be increased by more than 600,000 new members in the mid-year. At present it seems likely that unemployment will be higher next autumn than last.9. How events will, develop then it is impossible to say. It is fortunatethat the present construction boom has developed to offset the decline in capital equipment investment but not entirely fortuitous since the demand for housesis being stimulated by Government financial facilities, and the public construction programme is part of the Governments policy for maintaining overall demand.Probably the future depends mainly on whether construction activity will continueto expand sufficiently to offset the further decline in investment in durable equip-ment (and of exports) expected later in the year, and continue to do so until such time as business decides that new openings for profitable investment justify a reversal of the decline.
