THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 5120th March, 1950CABINETTHE  BRITISH  COUNCIL IN  RUSSIAN  SATELLITE  countries memorandum by the Secretary of State, for Foreign affairs. Future of the British Council in Satellite countries. It is necessary to decide whether, in view of the Hungarian governments request for the withdrawal of the British Council, and the hostile attitude adopted towards the Council by the Czechoslovak authorities, we should either (i) take the initiative and withdraw the British Council from all the remain-ing satellite countries in which it operates, i.e., Czechoslovakia, poland and Bulgaria, or(ii) wait until withdrawal is demanded by the Governments concerned.Recommendation2. I recommend that we should adopt course (ii) above, and that in themeantime His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Prague should be authorised to address a Note to the Czechoslovak Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 5below.A rgument3. In Czechoslovakia the Council has for some time past been the object ofpetty persecution by the authorities, including the suppression of quasi-diplomaticprivileges for its staff, the police interrogation of one of its staff in Prague, andthe intimidation of Czechoslovaks who visit British Institutes. This campaignhas been accentuated since the defection on 4th February of Dr. Arna Rides, acrypto-Communist, who was the CounciFs Medical Officer in Prague.4. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors opinion, in which the British CouncilRepresentative in Prague and the Chairman of the Council in London concur,is that it is fairly clear that the Czechoslovak Government intend, if possible,to stultify the Council&apos;s work and would like to drive it out altogether, and forthis purpose may be expected to resort more and more to police methods with consequent danger to the CounciFs personnel.5. The Ambassador therefore proposes to force the issue with the Czecho-slovak Government by addressing to them a Note, which would (a) rehearse our  reasons  for  anxiety  about  the  CounciFs  future  in czechoslovakia,(b) request the Czechoslovak Government to state their attitude with regardto the Anglo-Czechoslovak Cultural Convention of 1947,(c) suggest that a meeting of the Mixed Commission provided for in theConvention should be held on or about a specified date in the nearfuture, in order to review the state of Anglo-Czechoslovak culturalrelations, and(d) state that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government are not informed at an early datethat the Czechoslovak Government agree to this meeting of the mixed Commission, they will conclude that the Czechoslovak Govern-ment do not seriously desire the continuation of cultural relationsbetween the two countries.384783
6. The effect of the proposed Note may well be to precipitate the withdrawalof the Council from Czechoslovakia, which would be tantamount practically, ifnot formally, to a rupture of cultural relations. There is, however, in any casea real danger of the Council being expelled sooner or later with ignominy, possiblyafter police intimidation and even maltreatment of members of its staff. It couldbe argued that, this being so, and as (a) the British Council is being expelledfrom Hungary, and (b) in Poland and Bulgaria it appears to be only a questionof time before the Governments of those countries take measures to reduce theCouncil&apos;s scope in their territories below the point at which any effective workcan be done, it might be better to take the opportunity afforded by the recentaction of the Hungarian Government to notify not only the Czechoslovak Govern-ment, but also the Polish and Bulgarian Governments, of our decision to withdraw the Council from these three countries.7. If we decided to conduct a general withdrawal, we should have to con-sider the future of the Anglo-Czechoslovak Cultural Convention. The british council is not mentioned in the Convention, and the clause whereby the Con-tracting Parties may maintain Institutes in each other&apos;s territories is permissive,not mandatory. Nevertheless, it would hardly be consistent to maintain the Con-vention in the face of the implication of such a withdrawal, namely, that culturalrelations have been rendered impossible, and logically we ought in that case to denounce it. The Convention is initially valid for not less than five years; wecould not, therefore, formally terminate it until 1952, but we could indicate thatin practice we should treat it as having been rendered inoperative.8. Against an immediate withdrawal of the Council from Czechoslovakia,Poland and Bulgaria there are the following arguments : (i) Although it seems clear that all satellite countries are intended sooner or later to take their culture entirely from the U.S.S.R., to the exclu-sion of all such contact with the West, the pace at which they arebeing driven towards this goal is by no means uniform, and conse-quently their treatment of the British Council has not so far beenuniform. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Warsaw and Sofia havebeen consulted, and both are of the opinion that the Council&apos;s prospectsin those countries have not yet deteriorated sufficiently to justify a voluntary withdrawal. They consider that the Council can still douseful work, and has prestige value.(ii) By voluntary withdrawal we should be doing the Kremlin&apos;s work for it. Our friends in the satellite countries would interpret it as despairor indifference, our enemies as weakness, and the latter would exploitit as the work of a guilty conscience in respect of the accusationslevelled at the Council by the Hungarian Government. The work ofthe Council is undoubtedly welcome to the peoples, even if not to theGovernments, of the countries concerned, both as a link with the west and as a sign that the West wishes to maintain a link. In spite ofintimidation, the Council&apos;s classes and libraries are attended, andnationals of these countries engage in the Council&apos;s employment. Weshould think twice before voluntarily abandoning our friends afterencouraging them. A withdrawal forced upon us would, on the otherhand, be understood.(iii) In Czechoslovakia we have been presented with definite grounds forcomplaint, and the Mixed Commission meeting under the CulturalConvention forms a ready means of forcing the issue and at the sametime placing the blame on the Czechoslovak Government. With poland and Bulgaria we have no Cultural Conventions, the Polish Governmenthave given us no recent cause for complaint in this sphere, and the bulgarian Government have actually of late shown themselves moreobliging to the Council. With these Governments, therefore, we couldnot place the onus on the other side.(iv) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Warsaw, while appreciating the dangerof victimisation of the CounciFs staff, considers that the Polish police are not likely to act without having some grain of fact as their starting point. There have been indications of the possibilty of &quot; incrimina-ting &quot; documents being planted on the Council&apos;s premises, but even so,he considers that the Polish authorities would not attack the Counciluntil they have attacked, e.g., our Consulates, and that they would find it more difficult to incriminate a member of the British Council staff
than a diplomat, a consul or a business man. The Council themselves,while appreciating the risks involved, consider it their duty to incurthem, so long as their work is of use.(v) In Bulgaria the withdrawal of the Council at this juncture might givethe impression that we were preparing to follow the example of theUnited States and break off relations.9. I submit that the considerations in the preceding paragraph outweighthose in paragraph 6, and that we should therefore confine ourselves for thepresent to bringing matters to a head in Czechoslovakia and should take no actionin Poland or Bulgaria. The financial implications must of course be borne inmind, especially if the costs of operation become intolerably high; but at presentthe CounciFs direct expenditure amounts to  44,541 in Czechoslovakia,  30,724in Poland and  13,773 in Bulgaria, i.e., well under  100,000. This course ofaction has the concurrence of the Chairman of the British Council, who is opposedto any withdrawal, the initiative in which is not clearly taken by the other party.II. Employment of Members of British Council Staff who Marry nationals of Satellite CountriesProblem10. It is necessary to decide whether a member of the British Council&apos;s staff who marries a national of one of the satellite countries should be debarred from employment in another foreign country, on the ground that we cannot afford therisk of importing, in the wife, a potential agent into the council&apos;s staff abroad.Recommendation11. I recommend that the British Council be informed that, withoutprejudice to the existing position of their staff, we cannot in future allow membersof their staff who marry wives of satellite nationality to serve in any post in another satellite country, and that we can allow them to serve in other foreigncountries only after reference to the Foreign Office.A rgument12. Several cases have now occurred of British Council staff marrying, orbecoming engaged to, nationals of satellite countries. There has been no sugges-tion that the girls in question were deliberately &quot; planted,&quot; but their nationality and connexions give their Government an opportunity to exert pressure, if they wish to.13. My department and the British Council agree that the official should inany such case be transferred; and as the pressure capable of being exerteddirectly on the girl remains almost the same as in the original country if thetransfer is to another satellite country, such transfers should not be allowed.If the transfer is to a foreign country other than a satellite, the question is moredifficult, and much will depend on the circumstances of each case. There is alsothe possibility that an official may become acquainted with and marry a satellitenational while residing at a place abroad outside the Communist orbit. Pressure,however, may be brought to bear by means of relatives or connexions within the woman&apos;s country of origin.14. I consider that all cases should be referred to the Foreign Office, thatthe presumption should be that the Foreign Office will not consent to the officialbeing employed anywhere abroad, and that this should be made known to the council&apos;s staff. Knowledge, from the start, of the existence of a firm rulingshould act as a deterrent to the formation of such attachments, whereas, ifmeasures are taken ad hoc after the attachment has been formed, there is riskof precipitating the defection of the officer concerned.E.
