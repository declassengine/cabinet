Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950SECRETCopy No. 3 (LCP. (50) 66llth April, 1950CABINETAUSTRIAN treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in this memorandum I set down, for the information of my colleagues, thepresent position of the negotiations for the Austrian Treaty.2. The last of the reports which I have circulated, to the Cabinet on these negotiations was CP. (49) 110 of 13th May, 1949. In addition my colleagues will no doubt have read the White Paper (Cmd. 7729) which was issued after the paris Conference of the Council of Foreign Ministers last summer, and part ofwhich dealt with the decision of the Council affecting the Austrian Treaty.Briefly, the Paris Conference succeeded in breaking a deadlock which had existed for over a year and which had little chance of being resolved except at the levelof the Foreign Ministers themselves. The essence of the agreement reached onthe Austrian Treaty was that the Soviet Government withdrew their support fromthe territorial and economic claims of Yugoslavia, thereby removing two majorobstacles to agreement so far as the Western Powers were concerned: in return the latter agreed to meet Soviet claims under the German assets &quot; settlementsubstantially in the form in which they had remained since April 1948. this meant, chiefly, the acceptance of the Soviet claim to 60 per cent, of the oil explora-tion areas, and all former property of the Danube Shipping Company, in easternAustria, together with the payment by Austria to the Soviet Union of 150 million dollars over a period of six years from the coming into force of the Treaty.Certain lesser demands were also conceded to the Soviet Government and other points were left unsettled by the Ministers and referred to the Deputies. Thelatter were instructed to resume work in London at the beginning of July andto complete the Treaty within two months.3. This task proved to be beyond the Deputies&apos; powers, and, although con-siderable progress was made, final agreement was not reached on the &quot; german assets &quot; settlement or on half-a-dozen other Articles of the draft Treaty. Thiswas largely due to the fact that the Russians interpreted the Paris agreement in a manner which seemed to go beyond the decisions of Ministers in severalrespects. In particular they interpreted the decision to give them concession rights over 60 per cent, of the oil exploration areas in eastern Austria in a way whichwould in effect give them all the promising oil exploration areas in the country. Itwas accordingly agreed to resume the Deputies&apos; Conference in New York at theend of September, and three informal meetings were held by the Foreign ministers themselves in an attempt to remove the remaining obstacles to agreement. the deputies continued to sit in New York until shortly before Christmas, and inthat time the most contentious Article, on &quot;German assets,&quot; was eventuallyagi&apos;eed on the basis of the Soviet claims. Even so, final agreement was not reached on the Treaty. Towards the end of the meetings it became clear thatthe position of the Soviet Delegation, despite their apparent readiness earlier inthe year to conclude the Treaty, had hardened, and that they were determined,on one pretext or another, to delay its immediate conclusion. They removed oneminor Article (Article 48 bis, concerning their claims for supplies and servicesalleged to have been furnished to Austria since the end of the war) from theConference table by making its settlement dependent on the outcome of bilateral negotiations between themselves and the Austrians, which they showed no desire38544b
to expedite. Thus pi^ogress towards a Treaty was effectively blocked. This wasthe situation when the Deputies met once more in London on 9th January of thisyear, and it is still the position now.4. I should explain that, while Soviet policy ultimately underlies all out-troubles with the Austrian Treaty, we have also had difficulties with our western allies. Neither the United States nor the French Government seem really, tohave faced the full implications of getting an Austrian Treaty until it was too late to reverse the policy of trying to get one. For a long time the United StatesGovernment sheltered behind the supposed unwillingness of the Soviet Govern-meht to conclude a Treaty, and behind the complexity of the German assetsquestion. However, when the negotiations were resumed at the beginning of1949, the State Department had evidently decided in favour of concluding theTreaty, provided tolerable terms could be secured. It was indeed largely on united States initiative that a bargain was proposed in Paris last June wherebvthe Soviet Government were accorded substantial satisfaction in the german assets settlement in return for agreeing to abandon support of the claims of yugoslavia. It is possible that the Americans went further in Paris than they intended to, and that this was one of the reasons for their stubbornness in the subsequent negotiations. At any rate, when it became clear enough to us that,however unreasonable the Russian interpretation of the Paris Agreement, wemast be prepared to swallow it for the sake of getting an early Treaty, the americans were unwilling to do this, and insisted on leaving a number of pointsunsettled in the hope of eventually getting better terms from the Soviet. It was tothis end that we agreed to hold a further session in New York last autumn.5. The hesitation of the State Department wras not based solely on theirown doubts whether it was safe to concede to the Russians certain extra economic advantages in Austria for the sake of getting the Treaty : they were concernedalso with their own domestic difficulties, particularly with the Arnxy department and with Congress, and indeed with public opinion generally. The state department feared that further concessions to the Russians, even though this meant simply confirming them in the possessions which they already held, would raise such strong opposition, especially from those who were opposed to thewithdrawal of American troops from Austria, that it might be impossible toobtain ratification of the treaty by Congress. I had more than one talk with theUnited States Secretary of State (as well as with the French Foreign Minister)on this subject while I was in New York, and eventually persuaded him of theneed for doing everything in our power to get the treaty. I pointed out that anyrisks inherent in a general Allied withdrawal from Austria were greatlyoutweighed by the risks to Austria, and by the disadvantages to our wholeEuropean policy, of the continued Soviet occupation of the eastern zone. Iemphasised that, although their economic demands on Austria were undoubtedlyheavy, the Russians could only, in fact, be bought out of Austria at a certainprice, which we had already agreed in principle to pay : the points on which agreement was held up were really no more than marginal, and it could not becontended that by themselves they would make so much difference to the totalburden as to justify a refusal on our part to complete the treaty. After some weeks of careful preparation, the State Department were able to obtain approvalat the highest level for a policy of going ahead and getting the treaty, on thebest terms possible. Even so, however, the Americans insisted on fighting every point, and on yielding only gradually to Soviet demands (which it was by nowquite clear we should have to accept in their entirety) in order to be able to showCongress that no effort had been spared to wrest better terms. Although it was satisfactory to have brought the Americans round to our way of thinking, I fear that these tactics may have diminished our chances of getting early agreement on the treaty.6. The attitude of the French Government towards the conclusion of theAustrian Treaty had never been a factor of prime importance, and they were generally content to associate themselves with agreed Anglo-American policy.However, no sooner had we at last got American agreement in New York thanthe French Government raised fundamental objections to concluding the treatyat all. This eleventh-hour initiative was mainly the work of the French militaryauthorities, and their supporters, who regard the continued presence of american troops in Austria as a guarantee of French security. The French opponents ofthe treaty also exploited the personal preoccupation of M. Schuman with the
problem of displaced persons and refugees which arises on Article 16, a matterffjth which he appeared to come into contact for the first time in New York,although it had been before us for nearly three years. I do not doubt that% Schuman&apos;s qualms were perfectly genuine, although we ourselves consider them to be exaggerated. We were able, with the support of the Americans, torepel these efforts to sabotage the treaty, and latterly M. Schuman has givenus his assurance that, while France does feel there to be some risk in the treaty,he will not go back on past assurances and will not obstruct its conclusion. Hehas continued, however, to insist that the point at issue in Article 16 (see annex A) should not be conceded until it is clear that, by getting agreement onthis article, we are realty going to settle the treaty as a whole.7. Unfortunately, these French hesitations have not been without their effect on the Americans, whose military authorities have felt their doubts aboutthe treaty reinforced, and, while not going so far as to oppose its conclusion,have apparently succeeded in securing a ban on any concession on the oneremaining military clause (Article 27) unless and until such concession is shown to be necessary to secure agreement on the whole of the rest of the treaty.8. Five articles are now outstanding Nos. 16, 27, 42, 48 and 48 bis and I have summarised the points at issue in them in Annex A to this paper. TheAustrian Government have over the past months been urging the Western Powersto clear up all the outstanding articles, apart from 48 bis, which, as explained above, has been made entirely dependent on Soviet pleasure. Their object istwofold : first, to keep up Austrian morale, in face of the continued postponement of the treaty after five years of occupation, by being able to show that progress towards agreement is still being made; and, secondly, to isolate the Russiansby demonstrating beyond doubt that it is they alone, by their attitude on the oneremaining article (48 bis), who are responsible for holding up agreement. TheAustrian Government argue that none of the points at issue in the four other articles is of material importance to Austria or the Western Powers. on article 16 (Displaced Persons and Refugees), they claim that the point in disputehas no real substance. On Article 27 they claim that, although the restrictiveSoviet clause may lead to some inconvenience, it could in practice be got round.On Articles 42 and 48, where our own interests are concerned, they have declaredthemselves ready to give any supplementary assurances we may require, outsidethe treaty, to guarantee us the same treatment as we consider would have been secured by the acceptance of our drafts for these articles. They have furtherdrawn attention to the danger that, as long as these last two articles remainunsettled, the Russians can shelter behind them and represent themselves aschampioning Austrian interests against the exorbitant claims of the western powers. They have already had to face Communist propaganda on this score.Finally, the Austrians have emphasised that, however unsound the Soviet position on these articles, ordinarj&apos;- public opinion, especially in the Soviet Zone of occupa-tion, can hardly be expected to appreciate the fact, and will tend rather to takethe attitude of &quot; a plague on both your houses,&quot; so long as the Russians are ableto point to the existence of other unagreed articles besides 48 bis, especially thoseinvolving Western &quot; claims &quot; on Austria.9. There is undoubtedly force in the Austrian Government^ contentions.The Western Powers&apos; reasons for not complying with the Austrian request havebeen the following. First, we are reluctant to give way on the actual points in-volved until it has been shown necessary to do so in order to get the Treaty. TheFrench, and to some extent the United States Government, attach importance tothe point about refugees in Article 16. The United States Government attach importance to the point in Article 27, in connection with the need for building upAustrian security forces as effectively as possible after the conclusion of theTreaty. On Articles 42 and. 48, we would naturally prefer to get our text acceptedrather than have to work out an agreement with the Austrians outside the Treaty,a procedure which is not free from difficulty. Moreover, the Soviet Governmenthave in the past given us grounds for hoping that they will eventually accept our texts of these two Articles, once their own interests elsewhere in the Treatyare satisfied. We should be rash to rely on these assurances, but so long as thereJs any chance of getting our requirements accepted a premature concession to theRussians might be regarded as unnecessary and undesirable. In general, theWestern Powers and particularly the United States and French Delegations have been opposed to making any further concessions to the Soviet Government,38544 b 2
even to the extent of consenting to discuss any modifications in our position onthe remaining unagreed Articles (which have already been discussed ad nauseam)so long as the Russians are holding up the Treaty over Article 48 bis and would continue to hold it up even if the other Articles were all settled. We have replied to Soviet suggestions that we should discuss these other Articles by demandingfirst of all an assurance that Article 48 Ms can be settled at the same time, so thata settlement of the other Articles would also lead to agreement on the Treaty asa whole.   No such assurance has been forthcoming.10. At the last Deputies&apos; meeting on 1st March, the Western delegationsproposed an eight-weeks&apos; adjournment, and pressed the Soviet Deputy to urgehis Government to use the interval to enable a settlement to be made of Article48 bis. The three Western delegations agreed among themselves that advantage should be taken of this interval to examine measures which their three Govern-ments might take to lessen the strain of the occupation on Austria. They also agreed to consider their positions on the four other outstanding articles, and inparticular to examine whether it would be possible to make separate agreements with Austria outside the treaty which would protect their rights, and those ofother United Nations, were it to be found necessary to accept the Soviet texts ofArticles 42 and 48 in order that we should not get into the position of holding upthe treaty.11. As the Austrian Treaty will probably form a subject of the conversa-tions I am to hold with Mr. Acheson and M. Schuman next month, I have thoughtit desirable that my colleagues should be informed of the position in case I have toask their approval of any decisions which may be necessary, either to helpAustria bear the financial and moral burden of continuing the occupation, or tomake progress in these long drawn out negotiations. I also attach as Annex Ba copy of a telegram in which on 28th March I instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador to let Mr. Acheson know the way my mind is working on this subject.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,11th April, 1950.ANNEX AOutstanding ArticlesArticle 16 (Displaced Persons)This article is agreed except for one paragraph which contains a Soviet pro-posal designed to prohibit Austria from granting public relief to certain categories of displaced persons and refugees remaining in her territory. TheWestern Delegations do not regard the proposal as justified, but have neverthe-less agreed to accept it, provided it is limited in its application to displaced persons in the strict sense of the term and not extended to political refugees whorefuse to return to their native countries. This limitation the Russians haverejected. There is a large displaced person and refugee population in Austria, anildespite repatriation and resettlement elsewhere a considerable 1&apos; hard coreremains. Furthermore, it is being augmented by a trickle of persons escapingfrom &quot; iron curtain &quot; countries.On the assumption that the treaty leaves the Austrians masters in their ownhouse, we do not consider that the inclusion of refugees in this paragraph will result in any serious danger of pressure being put on them to return against theirwill to their homes behind the iron curtain. The French and United states government are concerned unduly in our view with the effect of the clauseon humanitarian sentiment in their countries, and although they now agree thatthe treaty should not be held up for the sake of this article, they are unwilling toaccept it until a settlement of the whole treaty is in sight. Meanwhile we are examining measures which might be taken before the coming into force of thetreaty to safeguard the position of the persons concerned.Article 27 (Prevention of German Rearmament)This article, aimed at preventing the possible rearmament of German)through Austria, has been agreed except for a Soviet proposal prohibiting Austria
from employing any foreigners in &apos;&apos; military or civil aviation or in the experi-mentation, design, production or maintenance of war material.&quot; This we regardnot only quite out of place in the present article which already contains a pro-vision precluding Germans and Nazis from employment in Austrian war industry-but also as constituting an unjustified limitation on Austriansovereignty. No such restriction is contained in any of the &quot; satellite &quot;. peace treaties : and the fact that Austria has been so thoroughly demilitarised by the occupying powers makes it more, and not less, reasonable for her to be allowedto seek outside assistance in the re-creation of her armed forces, within the treatylimits. (It may be mentioned that the United States Government have plans for assisting Austria to equip and train her future army, while we are ready to dothe same for the air force.) At various times the Soviet representative has hintedthat he will withdraw his proposal, once other matters in the treaty are settled,but we can have no assurance that he will do so, especially in the light of currentSoviet propaganda about our intention to use Austria as a base for our own&quot; aggressive &quot; plans. The Western Powers would not allow this clause alone tohold up final agreement on the treaty, and it could probably be got round inpractice. But the Americans are not ready to yield on it at present except as partof a complete settlement.Article 42 (United Nations property)In this article, which is to a large extent based on the model of the&quot;satellite&quot; treaties, the Soviet representatives, while accepting the general principle of the restoration of United Nations property rights, have sought intheir draft to limit its scope in a way which the Western Delegations considerunjustifiable. The points at issue are somewhat legalistic and some of the Russianproposals are themselves now out of date : to accept them would neverthelessinvolve prejudice to appreciable British, American, French and other united nations interests, particularly in oil. The Austrians have declared themselvesfully prepared to meet our requirements, and have urged us to arrange for thisoutside the treaty, thereby enabling us to accept, if necessary, the Soviet text. a study of this possibility is now being made.Article 48 (Debts)This article contains a Soviet proposal for an additional clause which wouldhave the effect of freeing Austria from any obligation to resume the servicing ofinternational loans as regards those countries who made special arrangements with Germany after the Anschluss for the servicing of certain former Austriansecurities held by their nationals. The proposal is directed primarily against HisMajesty&apos;s Government, which was one of the guarantors of certain internationalloans to Austria, and which made arrangements with Germany for the continuedservicing of these after the Anschluss. These arrangements we regard as havinglapsed, at the outbreak of war, and the Austrian Government have declared their willingness to reassume responsibility for all her pre-Anschluss loans. Britishinvestments worth some  14 million are involved, and there are lesser interests on the part of France and other countries, though not the United States. here again the Austrians have asked us to study the possibility of meeting our require-ments outside the treaty, and we are doing this.Article 48 bisThe Western Delegations proposed a waiver of claims by the occupying powers for all supplies and services furnished to Austria by way of relief sincethe end of the war. The Russians, however, although their own claims under this head are very dubious, insisted on being reimbursed by the Austrian Govern-ment. Eventually, in November last, we agreed to accept the Soviet proposal,only to be told that Soviet claims were now the subject of separate negotiation with the Austrian Government in Vienna, and that until these were concludedthe article could not be settled. The Russians have maintained this attitude ever since, and have so far deliberately obstructed the Vienna negotiations, althoughthe questions involved are simple enough. Thus, in effect, the Russians are usingthis^article to hold up the treaty. They have also made a change of attitude on articles 42 and 48 dependent on the settlement of 48 bis, and in any case so longas one article remains unagreed the treaty as a whole cannot be settled.
. ANNEX BTelegram from Foreign Office to Washington(No. 1416.  Saving) 28th March, 1950.I have been thinking about the future of the Austrian Treaty negotiations,and as I hope to discuss this question at the meeting in May, I shall be glad ifyou would prepare Mr. Acheson&apos;s mind by letting him know my thoughts in thefollowing terms : 2. As Acheson will recall from the discussions I had with him and Schumanin New York last autumn, I have for some time been concerned at what mayHappen in Austria if there is no treaty. It was for that reason that I pressedAcheson and Schuman last autumn to agree to make such concessions in the treaty negotiations as might be hoped to secure agreement with the Russians.3. Six months have now elapsed, and I am just as much convinced of thedesirability of getting the Soviet out of Austria in the interest both of Europeanpacification and of the maintenance of Austria&apos;s will and capacity to surviveas an independent State. I think that both Acheson and Schuman are in agree-ment with me on this, and on the desirability of completing the Treaty as soonas possible. Unfortunately the Russians do not appear to be willing to concludethe Treaty at present. The result is that the efforts we made last year to reach agreement have so far proved vain.4. Five articles remain outstanding 16, 27, 42, 48 and 48 bis. The SovietDeputy has repeatedly said that he cannot change his position on Articles 42and 48 until the questions falling under 48 bis have been settled. Those questions were referred for study to the Soviet experts last October, and the Soviet authori-ties are making no attempt to settle them. So long as this remains the Sovietattitude there can be no settlement of Articles 42 and 48 on the basis of theWestern texts. Moreover, it is now by no means to be assumed that the Sovietwould settle 42 and 48 on our terms even when 48 bis is out of the way. TheSoviet attitude in regard to Articles 16 and 27 is less clear. Last NovemberZarubin indicated that the Soviet might give way on Article 27 if they gotsatisfaction on 16 and 48 bis as well as 35. Since then the Soviet position seemsto have hardened,&apos; and there is no certainty that our acceptance of theirArticle 16 (5) would lead to withdrawal of their objectionable clause in Article 27.5. His Majesty&apos;s government position in regard to these four articles isas follows. We consider that the effect of accepting the Soviet 16 (5) is less serious than has been suggested. We are prepared to agree to it. While we do not likethe Soviet addition to Article 27, we would, in the last resort, be prepared toaccept it as part of a final settlement. I cannot feel that the Russian additionto Article 27 is of intrinsic importance in regard to Austria&apos;s future ability toprotect herself within the Treaty limits. Austria can only be made able to protectherself against a Putsch and local disorders, and not against invasion, andfor this the assistance of foreign technicians in her aviation, &amp;o, is not indis-pensable. In any case, Article 27 will not prevent Austria from sending hertechnicians to study abroad. On Articles 42 and 48 we are examining whetheragreements could be reached with the Austrian Government outside the Treaty,which would make it possible for us, if necessary, to accept the Soviet texts. Iam hopeful that it will prove possible to make such agreements.6. As I understand it, the attitude of the United States and the french governments has hitherto been that, subject to satisfactory arrangements provingpossible outside the Treaty for Articles 42 and 48, they would be prepared toaccept the Russian texts for the four articles if this was necessary in order toget agreement, and if such acceptance would in fact secure agreement on the whole Treaty text. (I appreciate that the United States Govern-ment are not themselves interested in Article 48, in which for us substantial sums are involved.) I understand this point of view and have not hitherto wishedto press the United States and French Governments to make further concessions on the Treaty if these were unlikely to lead to agreement on the whole text. Inthe last three months I have, however, received repeated and strong representa-tions from the Austrian Government to get these four articles settled, even though
this would not lead to full agreement. I have been bound to give considerationto these representations.  The Austrian arguments are as follows : (1) If the Russians were to decide to settle questions under Article 48 bis,the responsibility for holding up the Treaty would be thrown on theWestern Powers if they were then unable to accept the Soviet texts of 42 and 48. The Western Powers could be made to appear asblocking the Treaty for the sake of their restitution and financialclaims on Austria.(2) So long as the Western Powers insist on including clauses in the treaty for the restoration of their property and for the payment of pre-Anschluss loans, the Soviet are able to pose as protecting Austriafrom Western claims.(3) If there is to be no early Treaty Austrian morale must be fortified, andthe best way for the Western Powers to do this is by making progress with the Treaty, by settling these four articles and so giving evidenceof their determination to do everything that lies in their power tocomplete the Treaty.(4) If these four articles could be settled it would be clear to the whole world,as it is not at present, that it is the Soviet alone who are holding upthe Treaty.7. I am impressed by these arguments, and in particular by the argumentabout the effect on Austrian morale and by the awkwardness of the situation whichwould arise if the Soviet were to settle 48 bis while we were unready to settle42 and 48. I agree that there is no certainty that the settlement of these fourarticles would lead to the completion of the Treaty, but their settlement would undoubtedly put the Russians on the spot, and it is at.least conceivable that theSoviet Government might then be led to complete the Treaty, relying on delays in signature and ratification if they wished further to delay its early implement a-tion. (In this connection see, for what it is worth, the report by the AustrianMinister in Moscow, summarised in Vienna telegram No. 121.) I recognise theimportance of ensuring that outside arrangements can be made with the Austrianswhich will satisfactorily protect our claims, and those of other United Nationsnations for the restoration of their property and the payment of pre-Anschlussloans. It is perhaps arguable that the Soviet would make these outside arrange-ments an excuse for delaying the conclusion of the Treaty, but I feel that it wouldbe difficult for them to hold up the Treaty just because the Austrian Governmentchose voluntarily to meet United Nations claims which they are already inprinciple prepared to settle. Such a course would make Soviet obstruction tooobvious.8. I am therefore myself in favour of getting these four articles settled ifwe can, and my hope is that at our May meeting we shall be able to make progress on some of these matters which, like the Austrian Treaty negotiations, impedeour plans for building up our position, and for the consolidation of western europe. But I recognise the difficulties which some of these four articles repre-sent for American and French opinion, and I do not want now to ask Achesonto make concessions which might cause difficulties for him with Congress. I would however, ask him to reflect on this Austrian problem in the light of the con-siderations which I have mentioned above, in the hope that between now andMay he may be able to make it possible for us to make progress with the Austrian treaty at our meeting.
