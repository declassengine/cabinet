SECRETCP. (50)  74 COPY NO.21ST APRIL,   1950CABINETCHINESE CIVIL AIRCRAFT AT HONG- Kong memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Minister of state at the Cabinet&apos;&apos;s meeting on 6th April (CM. (50&apos;) 19thConclusions, Minute 2) there was general agreement with theview that it would he  inexpedient to press the Governor of hong Kong to use his powers under Article. 60 of the ColonialAir Navigation Order,  for the purpose of preventing certainChinese civil aircraft from doing flown out of Hong Kong;and it was decided that the Governor should &quot;be instructedthat,  pending the outcome of further consultation with theUnited States Government, he should continue in force such measures as he had been able_to take hitherto to prevent these aircraft being flown out of the Colony.2. This decision was duly communicated to the Governor.In a telegram dated 8th April he reported that there were strong indications that the local legal representatives of theCentral People&apos;s Government were going to force the pace, butthat he hoped to be able to &quot;stall&quot; for another week.      he added that,  thereafter,  and it might be before, he would haveto fall back upon the use of some statutory power to preventthe departure of these aircraft with all the grave consequences which that might entail.3. The Governor at the same time reported that thedevices which he had successfully adopted to prevent these aircraft from leaving Hong Kong, ever since the Court injunc-tions against their departure had been lifted on 23rd February,were (a) protracted correspondence on the conflicting claims that these air raft had been registered in China and inAmerica,  (b) withholding passes  to Kai Tak airfield fromflight personnel while this correspondence was going on,  and,more recently,  (c) persuading the Chinese who were in controlof the aircraft to drain the tanks of petrol on the grounds of fire hazard.4. After consultation with the Attorney-General afurther telegram was sent to the Governor on 1.3th April urginghim to continue to hold up the aircraft by any means in his power which did not involve the. formal use of statutory powers.5. In the meantime,  further examination of the legal position had revealed the existence  in Hong Kong of theEmergency (Control of Ships and Aircraft) Regulations,  1949,made by the Governor in October last, of. which we were not aware when this matter was last considered in the Cabinet.The Attorney-General has now given a further Opinion. (Annex A)from which it will be seen that he considers that,  if any

formal action based upon existing powers  is to be used bythe Governor,  it should he under these Regulations and not under the Colonial Air Navigation Order, hut that a morestraightforward and satisfactory course would he for HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to accept responsibility for an Order-ln-Council which would not onlyprovide for the detention of the aircraft, pending anadjudication ss to the title to them, but would also setup machinery for the trial of this issue.6. We also would prefer the making of an Order-in-Council, because the use of any power under the Emergency(Control of Ships and Aircraft) Regulations, 1949, mightwell be open to even greater political objections in hong Kong than the use by the Governor of his powers underthe Colonial Air navigation Order.7. The Minister of State saw the American ambassador on 14th April and the American Minister on the 19th,  and we attach (Annexes B and C) his record of those discussions.Prom Annex C it will be seen that the United States minister referred to the agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the United States Government to deny aircraft andassociated equipment to the Soviet Union and Europeansatellite countries and to urge other friendly european countries to follow suit.      The Minister went on to lay stress on the psychological effect on those countries ofthe release to the Central People&apos;s Government of theaircraft under dispute.      Although this agreement has notyet been applied to China,  and although this particular case would probably not be covered by the agreement even if theaircraft were being claimed by a European Communist country,the political implications and the point made by the AmericanMinister cannot be overlooked.      H.M.  Ambassador at Washingtonwas  instructed to make an approach to the United states secretary of State on the lines of that made by the Ministerof State on 14th April,  and it is possible,  though by nomeans certain,  that, by the time that this paper is consideredby the Cabinet, we shall have learned the reactions of theUnited States Government to the approach made to them.      If,as seems doubtful, that reaction is favourable, we shall hope to be absolved from the necessity of taking any formal actionto ensure the detention of the aircraft till the various issues now before the Hong Kong courts are determined eventhough the question of their ownership has not been decided.In that event we recommend that the Governor should be informedthat no further steps need he taken to prevent the departure of the aircraft.8. A decision is however now required as to the actionto be taken if the reaction of the United States Governmentshould prove to be unfavourable.      Prom the previous dis-cussion,  the Cabinet are already aware of the considerations which arise in this case.      If it  is now decided that theaircraft must continue to be held in Hong Kong, some formalsteps will be necessary to achieve this, since they are notat present subject to any restraint imposed by the Court andthe Governor may not be able to achieve this object for verymuch longer by his present stalling tactics.      In that event,as indicated in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, we consider that itwould be better to make a United Kingdom Order-in-Councilrather than to leave the Hong Kong Government to  incur theodium of using their powers under the Emergency Regulations.

g. The Cabinet should however be aware that, whilethe Governor has expressed appreciation of the proposal that responsibility for the detention of the aircraft should be&quot;patently assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, he has warnedus that, even if this  is achieved by means of a UnitedKingdom Order-in-Council,  and even if it is plainly recitedthat the purpose of the detention is to provide an opportunityfor the question of ownership to be determined in the courts,it will be regarded in Hong Kong as a departure from ouravowed intention of maintaining an impartial attitude inthis dispute.      The effect of the Order would be to deprive the Chinese interests first of immunity under internationallaw from the jurisdiction of the courts,  and secondly of effective possession and control of the aircraft, both ofwhich have already been held by the Hong Kong court to betheirs.      Further,  it  is not certain that the Chinese wouldtake part in the legal proceedings at all,   in which event the Court would have to decide the matter as best it couldwithout any presentation of the Chinese case.      -Against this it may be said that,   if no Order is made,  the Chinese willbe able by virtue of their immunity to remove property whichis possibly not theirs (and indeed in part probably nottheirs),  and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are failing intheir obligations to protect private rights of property in hong Kong.      If the Chinese parties do not choose, whenimmunity is removed by the Order-in-Council,  to plead their case,  the fault is theirs.10. It may be that we shall not learn the result ofour approach to the United States Government for some time,and that,  in the meantime,  the use of some formal powers may become necessary at very short notice.      For this reason werecommend that a draft of a United Kingdom Order-in-council which has already been prepared in consultation with the-Attorney-General should be laid forthwith before His Majestyat a special meeting of the Privy Council.      The Order should contain a provision enabling it to be brought into operationwhen required.      The intention would be that it should notbe brought into operation unless and until it was required,and even then only after consultation between the governor and the Secretary of State for the Colonies if time shouldpermit.11. V/e are advised that it would not be necessary to disclose the existence of the Order-in-Council unless anduntil it is brought into operation,  and we recommend thatIt should not be disclosed until necessary.      But it mustbe recognised that if the Order were brought into operationbefore the United States reactions were known,  therebycommitting us in advance of those reactions to holding theaircraft,  the United States Government would have littleincentive to accept the considerations which we have put tothem,12. It is of course possible that the necessity forthe use of some formal powers may arise before the proposed order-in-Council can be made.      In that event,  in spite ofwhat has been said in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, we see no alternative to the Governor&apos;s making temporary use of his powers under the Emergency Regulations until such time asthe Order-in-Council can be brought into operation.      If thiscourse should unfortunately prove to be necessary,  theGovernor should make it clear that he is acting afterconsultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.

13. The responsibility for the maintenance of theaircraft has hitherto been assumed by the Communist employees who are at present in possession and control of them, but,if an Order-in-Council is made,  the liability for their maintenance and protection during detention should in theopinion of the Attorney-General be assumed by Government.The same principle should clearly be applied if the governor has to exercise his powers under the Emergency Regulations.The detention of these aircraft in Hong Kong is entirelycontrary to the interests of the Colony,  and even the stallingtactics hitherto adopted by the Governor have been on the express instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom.      In those circumstances it would clearly beimproper (and indeed impossible, without the use in theLegislative Council of the overriding powers of the Hong&apos; KongGovernment) to require the Hong Kong Government to bear thecost involved.      We therefore recommend that the governor should be informed that any expenditure which it may benecessary to incur for this purpose will be accepted as a .charge against United Kingdom funds.      It is clearly impossibleto formulate any estimate as to the financial liabilityinvolved.      This will depend on the length of the period duringwhich it would be necessary to detain the aircraft pending adecision of the courts.      This period would be prolonged ifthere were an appeal to the Privy Council.      The Governor had,however, reported that the task of maintenance would have tobe entrusted to other air line operators and that the cost would be heavy.      lie is being asked whether he can furnishany estimate of the weekly cost, but it is unlikely thatthis information will be available by the time this paper is considered by the Cabinet.      In the meantime we areexploring the possibility of this work being undertaken bythe R.A.P. ,  though it, seems unlikely that this will beposs ible.14. Moreover the Governor has repeatedly warned us thatthere may be a heavy claim for damages if these aircraft aredamaged whether as a result of sabotage, or by fire or in thetyphoon season.      Indeed the Hong Kong Government have receivedformal notification from both the American and the Chineseinterests that that Government will be held responsible for anydamages arising from the retention of these aircraft in hong Kong.      It is by no means clear to us that the Hong KongGovernment would in fact be legally liable for such damages,but these questions would have to be dealt with if and whenany claims were made.      Here again,   it would clearly beimpossible to expect the Hong Kong Government to meet suchclaims if they were successfully established, and we must ask that any such liabilities should similarly be accepted as a charge against United Kingdom funds.      It is quite impossibleeven to guess at the possible amount of such claims.      Butthe-Cabinet should be aware that the value of these aircraft has been variously estimated at anything up to 20,000,000United States dollars.      At the same time it must be rememberedthat if we let the aircraft go,  the way is open for an Americanclaim on the basis that His Majesty&apos;s Government have failedto fulfil their obligations under international law to protectUnited States property rights  in Hong Kong.      It goes without saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not accept any claim for damages unless fully satisfied as to their liability.

15.To sum up -(a) If the reaction to our approach to the UnitedStates Government is favourable we shall hope to he absolvedfrom the necessity for taking formal action to retain these aircraft in Hong Kong in the absence of any restraintimposed by the Court.(b) If an unfavourable American reaction is receivedbefore Monday next, we shall be confronted with the sameissues as those on which the Cabinet were divided at their last meeting.      Since then,  however, we have had the benefitof the further Opinion of the Attorney-General,  in sub-sections (v) and (viii)of paragraph 4 of which he has suggestedthat,  in. a case where  nurisdictional immunity is claimed and where consequently the law &quot;cannot take its course&quot;,  it maybe proper for the Executive to intervene.      In these circura-stances we consider that the aircraft should be detainedpending a decision as  to their ownership,  and for this purposewe recommend that an Order-in-Council should be made forthwith.We also recommend that the Governor should only be authorisedto apply the Hong Kong Emergency Regulations in the event ofhis finding it impossible to detain the aircraft by stallingprocesses before the Order-in-Council is ready.(c) If no further United States reaction is receivedby next Monday, we consider that,  In the light of the attorney-General&apos;s arguments referred to above, the aircraft should likewise be detained until this reaction is received.For this purpose we again recommend that an Order-in-council should be made forthwith, but that it should not be broughtinto operation unless the Governor is unable to hold theaircraft any further by means of stalling tactics,  or unlessan unfavourable American reaction is received.(d) We also recommend that any financial liabilitiesarising in connection with these aircraft (whether inrelation to their maintenance,  or to meet a valid claim for damages) should be accepted as a charge against UnitedKingdom funds and should not fall on the Hong Kong Government.J.

ORIRIOH 0? ATTORI^Y-GBHSRAIRoyal Courts of justice,London , \&apos;h C. 2.Gentlemen,I refer to my opinion dated the 3rd April regardingthe action to be taken concerning certain civil aircraft nowlying at Hong Hong./.s I anticipated at Cabinet on the 6th April..mightbe the ease.  I am told that the Governor has represented thatit may be impossible for him to continue much longer, withoutany express statutory authority, the delaying tactics which hehas hitherto pursued to prevent the aircraft in question beingflown away, end he appears unable to take any effective measures to -prevent the export of spare parts.      Unless, there-fore, the matter can be settled through diplomatic channels inthe near future instructions will have to be given to theGovernor as to the action he is to take.(1) Since I gave my original opinion I have been instructed that it has now come to light that as recently as21st October, 1949, the Governor of Hong Hong promulgated and published, under the powers vested in him by the emergency regulations Ordinance 1922, Regulations known as the Emergency(Control of Ships and. Aircraft) Regulations, 1949, which empowerhim when.....it-appears to him &quot;expedient in the public interestso to do&quot; to prevent aircraft leaving the Colony.      TheGovernor&apos;s power    to make Regulations under the originalOrdinance arises &quot;on any occasion which the Governor incouncil may consider to be an occasion of emergency or publicdanger.&quot;     He presumably considered the circumstances existing in October constituted such an occasion.      Once made, theRegulations - which may deal with &quot;any matter whatsoever whichthe Governor considers desirable in the public interest&quot; -continue in force until revoked.      They are in force now andthe Governor is,  in my view, clearly entitled to detain theaircraft under these Regulations if he considers it in thepublic interest so to do.(2) In these circumstances,  if any formal action baaedupon existing legislative powers has to be taken by theGovernor I am clearly of opinion that it must be taken underthe Emergency Regulations and not, as previously contemplated,under Article 6o&quot; of the Colonial Air navigation Order.      Ifany action is taken,  it will obviously be open to Communistcriticism in Hong Hong on the ground that it Is dictated by political considerations.      Ihat being so, it is especially important that if action is taken it should be based on thefirmest legal foundation.      As I. pointed out at Cabinet and inray original opinion,  action under Article 60 of the ColonialAir navigation Order would at the best have been of doubtful-legality and would in any event have involved a not veryplausible use of powers created for a different purpose.       Itis moreover arguable that in acting under Article 66 theGovernor would have to be satisfied affirmatively that either the Chinese or the American registrations were invalid andthat uncertainty as to which was valid would not&apos;be enough,,although it is true that  (assuming it did not appear that theGovernor had directed his mind to the wrong question), thecourts would not go behind bis decision that &quot;he was satisfied&quot;that the Order would, not be complied with if the aircraft were flown on Chinese or American papers as the case might be.

Q AOilOn the other hand,  there can be no doubt that itwould be proper1for the Governor to detain the aircraft underthe Emergency Regulations if he considers it in the publicinterest so to do, nor could it he doubted that it might bein the public interest so to act in order to prevent the air-craft being disposed of pending an adjudication as to&quot;theirtitle.       If, therefore, action is to be  taken at all under existing legislation,  it should be under the Emergency Regula-tions and the availability of the Colonial Air Navigation Orderneed not be further considered.(3) V/hether it is &quot;in the public interest&quot; to detain theaircraft is, as I have ventured previously to emphasise,essentially a political question.      The dilemma in this matter is not as to the legal steps which could be taken but as to policy.      Is it better to meet the ^merican representationseither by using the existing Emergency Regulations or (as Iincline to think preferable) by ad hoc legislation at the costof prejudicing such chances (perhaps already very slender) ofestablishing friendly relations with the Communist Governmentof China?      Or is it preferable to leave the parties to theirown legal remedies (if any there be) in the hope, perhapsremote, that the Chinese Communists may thereby be conciliated,although our relations with the United States may be embarrassed?      This is a question of policy on which it is not for me to express a view.      But I venture to think that thefollowing considerations should be kept in mind in deciding it.(h)             (i) The aircraft were transferred to the Americanswith the approval of the Chinese Nationalist Government at atime when that Government was recognised by His Ma jest;.&apos;- as thede jure Government of China.  &apos; -............-..........(ii)  It is at least probable that ,the, title to some,if not all the aircraft,  has in law been transferred to theLmerlcan interests.(iii) The aircraft were\flown to Hong Song byservants or agents of the Chinese National Government or of a corporation controlled by it.(iv) They have come  into the possession and controlof the Communist Government only owing to the defection ofthose servants or agents at a time when His Majesty continuedto recognise the nationalist Government as the de jureGovernment.(v) That whilst it is desirable that the Executiveshould stand aside, as between rival claimants and &quot;allow thelaw to -bake its course&quot; the rule as to jurisdictional immunityclaimable in Sovereign States prevents the law taking a normal course or settling the rights of the parties according to the justice of the case.(vi) &quot;Chat the decision of the Hong Court court as topossession and control is not final and might eventually be reversed by the Privy Council.(vii) That the Hong Kong court has granted no injunc-tion to preserve the  status quo meantime.(viii) That where the law cannot take its course and decide the rights of the parties owing to a claim to juris--dictional immunity it may be proper for the Executive to intervene to see that those who - on one view - might beregarded as being in illegal possession of the aircraft shouldnot be able to dispose of them to the prejudice of others whoclaimed their ownership.

(iz) That in any event, if the aircraft are eventuallyflown away, this would in effect involve the Governor&apos;acceptance of the American or Chinese registration, as thecase may be, as being valid,I mention these matters not in order to point toone conclusion rather than another on what&apos; is manifestly amost difficult question of policy, but merely to indicate thatthe merits may not be entirely on one side.(5) If it should be decided that policy requires theExecutive to intervene my own view is that, notwithstanding the availability of the Emergency Regulations, the more straight-forward and satisfactory course would be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the united Kingdom to accept responsibility foran Order in Council which,  after reciting that the question ofthe possession of the aircraft was still the subject oflitigation, that the aircraft were registered both in theU.S.A.   and in China, that both the Chinese Government andcertain American Corporations claimed to be the owners of theaircraft,  and certain spares, that in these circumstances theGovernor, s right to accept one registration or the other asvalid was in doubt and that the ownership of the aircraft should be settled by normal process of law,  and should provide(a) that the aircraft should be detained pending an adjudica-tion as to title;    (b)  set op machinery for the trial of. this issue;    (c) impress on the Governor the duty of protecting and maintaining the aircraft in the meantime.I am,  Sirs,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd. )    HARTLEY 3EAV7CR03S.aw Officers&apos; Department,17TH APRIL,  1950.

g 00 6NOTE BY THE MINISTER OP STATE OP HIS MEETING- WITHTHE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR ON lkTH APRIL. 1950I handed the Ambassador two memoranda, one dealingwith the general political issues and the other setting outin detail the legal considerations.    I reminded hirn that wehad always insisted that this dispute should be settled bythe normal process of law, with which we could not interfere.After full consideration we-had reached the conclusion that wecould not,  by the normal use of existing legal powers,  hold the spare parts or the aircraft any longer.    The spare partswere being removed at the present time.    We were holding theaircraft by administrative obstruction,  but the Governor&apos;position was getting more and more difficult and could notbe maintained much longer.    His Majesty&apos;s Government were therefore faced with a decision either to let the aircraftgo or to take executive action to hold them which would constitute an interference with the normal processof the courts and would be clearly seen by the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment and by Chinese interests in Hong Kong to be an act of discrimination, designed to prevent the People&apos;s Governmentobtaining the benefit of the court&apos;s decision, which so farhad been favourable to them.    I pointed out that action ofthis kind would not only be contrary to our contention through-out the case that we were acting impartially and were leaving the decision to the courts, but, what was more important,  itwould undermine the reputation built up over many years bythe Hong Kong authorities for the impartial administration ofjustice.    We were fully aware of United States feelings onthis issue, but felt bound to recall that the whole situation had arisen through the refusal of United States Interests toaccept our urgent advice given last year to remove theaircraft from Hong&apos; Kong.2. At this point the Ambassador interrupted to saythat United States interests could not be blamed since atthat time they only held. 20% interest in one company and no interest in the other.    I said that however that mightbe it was American personnel and the American Consul general who had told the Governor that  they wished to stay in HongKong in order to trade with Communist China.    I could notbelieve that this policy was dictated by Chinese Nationalistinterests.    I   outlined to the Ambassador the consequences which we feared if we discriminated against the Chinese.I referred to the internal situation in Hong Kong,   the reper-cussions upon our position in China generally and the precariousposition of Hmg Kong itself vis-a-vis the Chinese People&apos; sGovernment.    I said that the policies of our respective governments in the Par East would be among the subjects fordiscussion in May and that if any adjustments were  neededthat was the time to make them.    We did not feel,however,that we ought to alter our normal policy on. this particularinstance if, by so doing, we were liable to jeopardise the reputation of British justice in the Par East.11. I told the Ambassador that the final decision wouldbe taken by Ministers fairly shortly and that I ought to warnhim that the decision might very well be to let the law-take its course.    I suggested that it would be in the long term interests of both our countries to try to minimise the inevitable embarrassment which might result from this unhappyincident.

5. In subsequent discussion the Ambassador returnedto the two points which he had previously emphasised.    First,neither he nor the State Department has been convinced by ourexplanation of our reaswns for having advised the Hong KongCourt as we did ab out the status of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment in the period preceding 5th January.    Secondly, hecould not accept the justice of any process of law whichpermitted a party to a dispute about movable property to pursuean appeal, but at the same time declined to take any stepsto protect the property meanwhile.    Legal process under theseconditions was simply a farce and he asked again whether wecould not use our emergency powers or some other methodmerely to hold the property while the Courts took a decision about ownership.    He appreciated what the Chinese reactionmight be if we took executive action,  but he emphasised that american opinion, both official and unofficial, would find itimpossible to believe that the legal situation had not beentwisted to their disadvantage if they found that the property was disposed&apos; of without their even having a chance to get itstrue ownership established in the Courts.    He thought moreoverthat Chinese policy towards H-ng Kong would be determined bygeneral considerations,  and that it would not be deflectedfrom its course merely because we gave the Chinese satisfactionover this particular incident,6. At the end of the  interview the Ambassador did notrepeat his -warning about repercussions in Washington but merely said that he was very sorry that we should have got intothis situation.K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.I.,17TH APRIL,  1950.

ANHEX CTEXT OF DISPATCH FROM MINISTER OF STATE TOHAM.  AMBASSADOR. WASHINGTONForeign Office, S.V/.1.19th April, 1950.Sir,The United States Minister, Mr. Holmes,  called againabout the Chinese aircraft in Hong Kong.    He first drew myattention to the fact that an appeal had been launched in HongKong last Thursday against the refusal of an injunction andthat the hearing of this appeal is due to take place on27th April.   -He urged me very strongly to ensure that no  &apos;planesleft before the appeal could be heard.    On this point I repeatedwhat I had said to the Ambassador at our previous interviewabout the extent of our legal powers.    I said that in fact wehad so far succeeded in arranging that the  &quot;planes should not leave, and were hoping to be able to continue to do so untilMinisters in London had taken their final decision.    It isnow only eight days until the appeal is due and I said itmight be that we could manage to hold them until then, though did not feel I ought to give a formal undertaking to that effect.2. Mr. Holmes then referred to the agreement between our two countries to deny  &apos;planes and associated equipment to the Soviet Union and satellite countries.    He urged me toconsider very carefully this aspect of the American case.    both our countries had been engaged for some time past in trying to persuade European countries to deny supplies in the same way as we were doing and he thought they would not understandit if we allowed these seventy &quot;planes to go to China.    he recognised that China had not actually been added to the listof satellite countries for the purposes of this agreement buthe felt that the principle certainly applied to China as tothe satellites.    I told him that I would give full weight tothis representation m.I am, etc.,K.G.  YOUNGER
