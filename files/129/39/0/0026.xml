CP.&apos; (50) 7621st April, 1950CABINETRAILWAY FREIGHT charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport: 1. At. their meeting on 23rd March (CM. (50) 14th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet (1) Invited me to discuss with the Minister of State for Economic Affairs thevarious financial and economic points which had been raised in the cabinet&apos;s discussion and to submit a further report.(2) Agreed to suspend meanwhile their decision on the application of theBritish Transport Commission for increases in railway freight ratesand dock charges.2. The points raised in the Cabinefs discussion may be briefly summarisedas follows : (a) (i) The serious effect of the proposed increases on the level of internal and export prices.(ii) The question whether the general wages position could be held ifsuch an increase in prices occurred.(b) (i) The possibility that an increase in freight rates would drive furthertraffic from the railways and so accentuate their difficulties.(ii) Without more precise and detailed information Ministers could not accept the conclusion that the Transport Commission^ under-taking as a whole must run permanently at a loss in default of theproposed increases.(iii) Ministers thought that there was room for substantial economies inoperation and the staffing of the railways.(iv) If the railways were allowed to re-equip on a more generous basisthan had so far been permitted they might attract more traffic.(c) The following possibilities were also discussed : (i) The balance between rail and road traffic might be improved byrestrictions on &quot; ,C &quot; licences or by fiscal measures designed toprevent the expansion of road transport.(ii) A longer view might be taken of the period over which the socialised industries should be expected to balance theiraccounts.(iii) There might be a case for treating transport differently fromother socialised industries which are expected to pay their way.(iv) A contribution might be made from the Exchequer for the main-tenance of the permanent way of the railways out of taxes paidby those using the roads.The points raised in discussion may be divided into three groups : (a) The effect of the proposed freight increases.(b) The efficiency of the railways.(c) Relief of the railways at the expense of the roads.38606 bISECRET Copy No.      32Printed for the Cabinet.

The Effect of the Increases3. It is not possible to show in terms of the cost-of-living index the effect on 1prices of the proposed increases. To do so would require information which is Inot available about the average haul of a wide range of raw materials, of semi-1c* C* manufactured goods and of the finished article. Some estimate can, however, be 1S;* made, of the probable increases in certain basic prices which would follow the!freight increases; but it is important to emphasise that they are hazardous. These 1estimates are given in the appended table, which also shows the increases following jthe increase in the price of coal in 1947, the increases following the withdrawal Iof the iron and steel subsidies in 1949 and the percentage increase on the 1938 Iprices which the new prices will give.The increases in present prices shown in column (iii) of this table, which will result from the proposed increase in freight rates, range from roughly li percent, to per cent., apart from tinplate and electricity. While price increases of this order are unfortunate, they are clearly not intolerable. They are, ingeneral, less than the increase following on the increase in the price of coal in1947, and substantially less than the increase due to the withdrawal of the steelsubsidies. The new over-all railway freight increase (about 80 per cent.) will stillbe substantially below the price increases shown in the last column of the table,apart from the special cases of gas and electricity. The  27 million involvedin the freight increases is only about one-half of 1 per cent, of output frommanufacturing, which gives some indication of the extent of its effect on industrialcosts. The Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade do not think that the effecton the prices of food and clothing respectively would be significant.Efficiency of the RailwaysCosts4.   Over-all costs are approximately 125 per cent, over pre-war.   They aremade up as follows : Per cent.Staff  ......&apos;..      .................. 62Fuel and Power     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 13Supplies and Services       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 21Depreciation          ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 4Total   ..................      ... 100A large part of the costs is therefore staff. Wages have approximatelydoubled since 1938, as is shown from the following information given in the Reportof the British Transport Commission for 1948. This information relates to allrailways; the increase on British Railways has been rather greater than that onthe railways of London Transport.Weekly WagesClerical, Supervisory, &amp;c.Conciliation Staff- Shop and Artisan Staff...The cost to the railways of coal per ton in 1948 was 175 per cent, above pre-war-war and there have been further increases in 1949. In addition the coal isof poorer quality, less suitable sizes and delivered in less convenient places.The British Transport Commission Report for 1948 also gives the followingincreases in the price of supplies and services : Increase over pre-war; Per cent.Tyres (per car mile)        ...       ...       ... 155Timber, general    ...       ....       - - -       - -       - - -       - -&apos; 225Timber, sleepers and crossings............ 344Paints and colours.................. 254Oil, lubricating    ............... 215Metals, non-ferrous         ............... 148Iron and steel      ... &quot;M1938 1948s.  cl. s.    d.93 10 155   368   7 135   071 11 146   6
In spite of increase in costs over the last year or two and an improvment in passenger facilities, total expenses have been kept in hand.  The figures are :  million1948 ...      ......      .........      ... ;    ...      3111949 (estimate)     ..........      ...      ...      ...      3121950&apos;(estimate)     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      3145. Numbers of staff are about 620,000 compared with 550,000 in 1938. Injustification there are four reasons : (a) The 44-hour week.(b) Increased holidays.(c) Improved conditions.(d) Arrears of maintenance, &amp;c, which have to be caught up.The Commission^ estimate was that (a), (6) and (c) above alone would require an increase in staff of 12-1 Per cent, (hours 5 per cent., leave 2^ per cent, andconditions 5 per cent.); the total increase is actually about 12f per cent.6.   Changes in total passenger and freight receipts are as follows :   million1947 (actual, adjusted to reflect present level of charges)   3491948 (actual).........      ......      .......   3361949 (estimate)        ...................   3241950 (estimate)        ........     ...      ...      ......   319Receipts from freight train traffic are fairly steady ( 183- 182- 178- 180million) and so are receipts from goods carried by passenger train ( 29 millioneach year). Receipts from passengers, however, show a sharp fall of  26 million in all ( 133- 123- 114- 107 million).Both fares and freights were increased in 1947, when the position was stillobscured by abnormal Government (including Forces) traffic. It has been sug-gested that the fall in receipts since 1947 has been due to the increases then made.In fact, however, much of it appears to have been due to a falling off inGovernment traffic, the figures for which have been :   million1947    ...      ......      ...      47 (including passenger 20)1948    ...      ...      ...      ...      40 (including passenger 14)1949    .......      ...      ...      34 (including passenger 10)1950    ...       .........      33 (including passenger   9)7.   Two suggestions which have been made are : (a) A further reduction in fares.(b) Cutting of services.It should be emphasised that the increase in the standard fare in 1947 was followed by the introduction of cheap tickets and excursions; in short, there hasbeen a discriminatory reduction in fares, which the Commission considered would yield a higher net revenue than a general reduction. It should also be emphasised that, while there are more trains running to-day than in 1947, there are fewer than before the war, although passenger miles are up. While one-ninth moretraffic was carried in 1948 than pre-war, passenger train miles were 20 per cent,below the pre-war figure. It is necessary to remember the intolerable conditionsof crowding in the trains before the increase in the services took place, and thepublic clamour for improvement. It was the view of the Commission that with-out something better than the 1947 passenger services, traffic would be lost to theroads for good.The number of trains and the level of fares which will produce the highestnet revenue is a nice point calling for expert judgment. The Commission have in fact exercised that judgment with the best advice available. The increase inthe number of trains was a deliberate policy which the Commission cannot beexpected to reverse unless and until they are satisfied that it is not yielding results;.at least they are satisfied that a general cheapening of passenger travel by trail is38606 b 2
rio cure for the existing deficit. I do not see how the Government can overrulethem on a matter of commercial policy in which they can certainly claim to be far more likely to be right.Efficiency8. The keeping of the rise in the price of transport services so much belowthe increase in costs, compared with pre-war, could not have been achieved except by improved efficiency.The main statistics are: Average      Average       Empty    Ton milesTrain Wagon       Wagon , moved perLoad Load Miles     engine hour(Tons)        (Tons)       per cent.1938        .........      125 5-55 33 4611947 .........      159 6-42 27 5161948 ...      ......      156 6-48 27 542The principal changes in the economics of transport since 1938 are summarised in paragraph 118 of the 1948 Report of the British transport commission a,nd, as far as they affect railways, are as follows :  (a) Weekly earnings per man are about double and prices of supplies and services are more than double.(b) Hours of work are less and there is a substantial increase of staff.(c) There are greatly improved ratios between train mileages and hours onthe one hand and ton miles or passenger miles carried on the other.(This is expressed in the very important statistics given above of theton miles moved per engine hour.)(d) These improved ratios are due on the freight side to the improvementin wagon capacity and loading, to the decrease in empty wagonshauled, to the longer hauls, to the bigger trains and decreasedshunting, partially offset by a slight decrease of the rate of movement.(e) On the passenger side the improved ratios are due to a reduction inunremunerative services and to a much heavier loading of trains,offset in part by a slightly reduced rate of movement on certain services.(/) There has been an increase in coal consumption per mile.Relief of the Railways at the Expense of the RoadsIntegration9. It has been suggested that steps should be taken to switch more traffic form road to rail. The scope for increased net revenue for the Commission from such a switch is very limited. It is estimated that the road haulage receipts ina full year after the acquisitions of undertakings have been completed will be between  60 million and  70 million, which compares with gross freightearnings on the railways of  210 million. It would not be economic to carrysome of this traffic by the railways and of the rest increased railway costs wouldhave to be set against the saving in road costs. There is certainly scope for aswitch from road to rail of certain selected traffic over certain selected routes;but there are limits to what this will do to improve the finances of the Commission.A restriction on the &quot; C &quot; Licence, whatever its merits, would involvecontroversial legislation which it would be impracticable to undertake in theimmediate future. The taxation of road vehicles and the increase in duty ontheir fuel will affect the Commission&apos;^ own vehicles to their detriment as wellas others and is not likely to improve the Commission^ position except in so faras traffic at present carried on &quot; C &quot; licences is driven over to rail. Of course,an increase in road freights would also put up prices just as the proposed freightincreases for the railways.10. As regards passenger traffic, the problem is to get on to the railways the traffic which can be most cheaply handled by the railways. There is little usein drawing back passengers on to branch lines which were formerly maintainedonly because they brought to the main lines passengers who would otherwise nothave travelled.   The problem is to use the buses in such a way that they feed the
railways, leaving the latter to concentrate on the traffics which they can handlejiost economically. This means that the process of getting passengers to therailways must be selective.The whole process of integration is a new field. It involves the procedure,laid down in the Act, of preparing Charges Schemes, which must be approved bythe Tribunal. It will undoubtedly raise labour difficulties which will have to be solved with&apos; the Trade Unions. It will present a host of difficult problems. Itcan only be tackled gradually and I am convinced that it must be a long-termprocess. There is no information on which to estimate the order of magnitude of the economies to which it may eventually lead.11. If the considerations set out are accepted, a decision on the point a tissue must be made on the basis that the Commission cannot be expected to makeends meet in the foreseeable future without the proposed increase of charges unless they receive extraneous aid from the Exchequer. A lump sum subsidy now would merely postpone the issue. A subsidy from year to year would be a continuedreflection on the principle of nationalisation as applied to transport. It wouldsap the vitality of the Commission and remove initiative. Assistance from theExchequer would add to Government expenditure, which we are all anxious toreduce. It would moreover involve the abandonment for an indefinite time of theprinciple embodied in the Transport Act that the Commission should pay its way; and it would be a complete change of the whole basis of our policy towardssocialised industries. It would mean increased financial control of the Corn-mission and an interference in its day-to-day management which we have not hitherto contemplated.It has been suggested that the Exchequer assistance might take the form ofa grant towards the cost of maintaining the permanent way, on the ground thatthe State maintains the roads for the road haulage and passenger operators.But the fact is that the revenue collected from these operators in licence and oilduties covers expenditure on the roads without allowing for the substantialrevenue raised from the private motorist, which contains an element of luxurytaxation. The licence duties and a proportion of the oil duties respectively paidby commercial goods and passenger vehicles in 1948 were put at approximately 24 million and  33 million total  57 million. Total expenditure on the roadsduring 1948 (by local authorities and from the Exchequer), as estimated in theEconomic Survey, was  43 million, of which  38 million was maintenance.Including administration and land acquisition the total would be of the orderof  55 million. It is true that maintenance expenditure in that year was farbelow the rate considered necessary to avoid deterioration in the roads : an addition of some  20 million would have been needed to meet pre-war standards,thus raising maintenance expenditure to about  60 million (and total expenditure to about  75 million). But the road haulage and passenger operators&apos; &quot; share &quot;of this is clearly fully covered by the duties they pay.Conclusion12. There, is growing pressure both in Parliament and the Press for anwhy decision in this matter so that trade and industry may know where they stand with regard to their future transport costs.  To sum up (a) The increase of charges for which the Commission apply is substantially less than those which have taken place in the prices of services andcommodities generally and, though unfortunate, cannot really beregarded as highly dangerous. It seems unlikely to affect the cost ofliving at all seriously.(b) The causes of the Commission^ financial difficulties are due in the mainto higher wages and other costs (though these have been largely offset by economies) combined with a decline in passenger receipts resultingto a substantial extent from a fall in Government traffic.(c) An immediate improvement in the Commission^ net revenue positioncannot reasonably be expected in the immediate future on the basisof existing fares and freights.id) The deficit of the railways cannot by any means be covered either by profitson road transport or by forcing traffic on to the railways and away from the roads.
(e) Any form of subsidy or Exchequer assistance is open to serious objection,in principle:(/) An immediate decision is desirable in the interests not only of theCommission but of trade and industry generally.. I would again ask my colleagues to assent to the proposed increases in theCommission^ railway and dock charges. The Minister of State for economic affairs concurs in this view.A.
