. fHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT        J0 printed for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 943rd May, 1950CABINETNIGERIAN constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the review of the Nigerian constitution which has been proceeding locallyfor the last year has now been completed. The procedure adopted for this review,although it involved full consultation with representatives of the people, was somewhat different from that adopted in the Gold Coast. In August 1948, justafter His Majesty&apos;s Government had announced agreement in principle to consti-tutional advances in the Gold Coast, the Governor of Nigeria, with the approvalof my predecessor, proposed to his Legislative Council that after a preliminaryperiod for the expression of public opinion the constitution should be reviewedduring 1949. This was accepted, and at the Budget Session in March 1949, theCouncil agreed to a procedure for popular consultation which was then put inhand. Conferences of representatives of the people were held in every provinceand subsequently in each of the three Regions of Nigeria and at Lagos. these were followed by a General Conference of representatives of the whole countryin January 1950, before which a Drafting Committee had produced concreterecommendations on the basis of the reports of the Regional Conferences. Thereport of the General Conference was subsequently discussed by the three RegionalHouses of Assembly (and the Northern House of Chiefs) and last month by a select Committee of the Legislative Council itself.2. The Provincial, Regional and General Conferences were attended bythe unofficial members of the present Legislative Council and the Regional houses of Assembly, together with a small number of officials. The process of consulta-tion has been most successful, both in the political education which it has pro-vided and in the proposals which have emerged from it. The purpose of the consultation was to produce agreed Nigerian views, and the task of the officialswas no more than to assist the discussions. Thehr presence, however, helped tokeep the Nigerian Government closely in touch with the discussions. There wasalso close consultation between the Nigerian Government and the Colonial Officeduring the later stages and the Chief Secretary of Nigeria flew to London earlyin January specially for the purpose of detailed discussions with my predecessor.The proposals which have emerged are unanimous, except for minority reports by a few members on a strictly limited number of points and for one remainingmajor difference between the North and the rest of&apos; the country to which I willrefer below. Subject to further discussion of a few relatively minor points andto the satisfactory solution of this one major difference, we now have a scheme of constitutional advance recommended by the representatives of the people of nigeria which in my view is entirely acceptable.3. The existing constitution provides for a Legislative Council for thewhole of Nigeria, with an unofficial majority, but with substantial official repre-sentation, and for Houses of Assembly for the three Regions, also with unofficialmajorities but with substantial official membership. In addition there is a Houseof Chiefs in the Northern Region. The Regional Houses so far have advisorypowers only with regard to legislation and finance, but a policy has been followed38680
by the Nigerian Government of devolving responsibility for purely regional sub-jects from the centre to the Regions. This policy has worked very successfullyand some advance in the powers of the Regional Houses is now called for. the governors Executive Council is purely advisory, with a substantial officialmajority, and the three unofficial Nigerian members on it have no executive responsibility for Departments of Government. There is need for greater partici-pation by Nigerians in the executive machinery both at the centre and in the regions.4. The Select Committee of the Nigerian Legislative Council, in endorsinggenerally the recommendations of the General Conference referred to above, hasin particular welcomed the proposals : (i) for greatly increased Regional autonomy within a united Nigeria;(ii) for giving Nigerians a full share in the shaping of Government policyand direction of executive Government action in a Central Council ofMinisters and Regional Executive Councils; and(iii) for the creation of larger and more representative Regional legislatureswith increased powers.These general principles are, I am convinced, absolutely sound.5.   The main proposals are as follows : (a) The existing Legislative Council should be enlarged and at the same timethe number of officials on it should be reduced. The Nigerian members should be selected (as the majority of them are at present) by the nigerian members of the Regional Houses from their own numbers.(b) The Regional Houses of Assembly should be enlarged and the officialmembership reduced. The Nigerian members should be selectedthrough electoral colleges the members of which would themselves be directly elected by the people. The Northern House of Chiefs shouldbe retained and a House of Chiefs should be established in additionto the House of Assembly in the Western Region. No such institutionis required in the Eastern Region, where there is no comparablesystem of traditional chieftainship.(c) The Nigerian legislature would approve the Nigerian budget and would retain full powers of legislation on all subjects. The Regional houses would have power to legislate over a substantial field, subject to thepower of the Council of Ministers to refer back such legislation and,if necessary, ultimately to reject it if they considered it to be in con-conflict with an overall Nigerian interest. The legislative fields of the nigerian legislature and of the Regional Houses would thus overlapconsiderably. It is recognised that eventually, as in most federal or partly federal constitutions, the centre and the Regions should haveseparate and distinct fields, possibly with concurrent powers over a third relatively limited field. But at the present stage, when the regional Houses will still be finding their feet, it is felt that thecentral legislature must retain unrestricted powers, while at the sametime the Regional legislatures must be given powers to legislate overa number of subjects. Experienced advice has been taken on the pointin this country and as a result of this I am satisfied that the arrange-ment proposed is suitable.(d) In place of the Executive Council there should be established a Councilof Ministers with the Governor as President; six official members (theChief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary andthe Chief Commissioners of the three Regions, who would becomeLieutenant-Governors); and twelve Nigerian members drawn, fourfrom each Region, from the Legislative Council. The Nigerianmembers would be Ministers, nine with portfolio and three without portfolio, The Council of Ministers would not be purely advisory tothe Governor as is the existing Executive Council. It would formulatepolicy and direct executive action. The Governor would have reserve powers which would apply both to the Executive Council and to thelegislature.(e) Regional Executive Councils would be established under the presidency of the Lieutenant-Governor and with official and Nigerian members,
the latter in the majority. The Nigerian members would be RegionalMinisters with or without portfolio. The Regional executive councils would formulate policy and direct executive action withinthe Region, subject to general directions on policy by the Council ofMinisters where the overall interests of Nigeria were involved.6. It has been no easy task to obtain substantial agreement between the*representatives of the conservative and Moslem North and the more politically-minded Ibos and Yorubas of the Eastern and Western Provinces. Three majordifferences arose during the discussions; of these one has been settled, the seconddisposed of for the time being and only the third remains to be resolved. Thethree differences are : (a) The Northern representatives, while raising no objection to ministers in the other Regions, were opposed to having Ministers either at thecentre or in the North itself. It is most satisfactory that they havenow agreed to Ministers both at the centre and in the &quot;North.(b) The Northern representatives claim that finance should be divided between the Regions on a per capita basis. This was a natural claim for them to make, as they are at once the richest and most populousRegion and that with the least developed social services. On theother hand, such an arrangement could not be introduced immediatelywithout disrupting the financial structure of Nigeria and involving theretrenchment of essential existing services in the Eastern Region,which is the poorest. It has been agreed that no formula covering the allocation of finance can be introduced into the constitution, butthat an expert and independent committee should be set up to under-take an enquiry into the division of revenue over a period of five years between the three Regions and the central Nigerian services. Theproposals of this committee would be considered by representativesof the threp Regions sitting in equal numbers under the chairmanship of the Financial Secretary. The independent enquiry will be con-ducted by Sir Sydney Phillipson, a former Financial Secretary of nigeria, Professor J. R. Hicks, of Nuffield College, Oxford, and an expert on federal-provincial relationships who is to be appointed from canada.(c) The third difference between the North and the other Regions whichremains to be resolved relates to the composition of the NigerianLegislature; this is discussed in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.7. There has been some difference of opinion about the treatment of Lagos,the capital of the country, which, with the immediately surrounding country areas,has hitherto been administered separately from the Western Region, of whichit forms a geographical part. On the basis of the proposals put forward by theWestern and Lagos Regional Conferences it. was first proposed that Lagos shouldbe included in the Western Region; but the General Conference itself recom-mended by a majority that it should be administered as an independent munici-pality not under the Western Region. The Select. Committee of the LegislativeCouncil has proposed by a majority that Lagos should form part of the WesternRegion, but with special safeguards to allow for its position as the Capital. Thethree members of the Legislative Council representing Lagos have submitted a minority report opposing this, in spite of the fact that the representatives ofLagos at the General Conference who were not members of the Legislative council had taken the opposite view. I propose to accept the majority view that Lagosshould be included in the Western Region.8. The representatives of the Northern Region have throughout contended that the North, which has more than half the population of the country, should begiven half the seats in the central legislature. This would be a most unusualprovision in a single chamber legislature under a constitution which already has some federal elements in it and is likely to become more federal as the Kegionsdevelop. Moreover, it is hardly surprising that the Eastern and Western repre-sentatives should be opposed to this arrangement, under which the North mightwell succeed in dominating the legislature. In spite of all the efforts of the nigerian Government, it has not so far been possible to resolve this difficulty.When the Northern representatives were out-voted on the point in the General
Conference their spokesman stated that, if the point was not met, the North wouldpress for separation from the rest of Nigeria as was the case before 1914. TheNorthern delegates thereupon prepared to leave the Conference, but were with difficulty persuaded by their colleagues to remain, on the understanding that their view would be recorded that, unless their point about representation was accepted,they would disassociate themselves from the other recommendations of the Con-&quot; forence. In the Select Committee of the Legislative Council the suggestion wasmade that, to meet the difficulty, a bicameral legislature should be adopted at thecentre, the composition of the House of Representatives being based on population and that of the Upper House on equality between the three Regions. This pro-posal is to be further considered by the existing Regional House and will come before the Legislative Council at its meeting in September.9. It is of the first importance to solve the difficulty about the composition of the central legislature. The unity of Nigeria must be the first aim of policy for the country. Northern Nigeria is relatively rich in natural resources andits people have great potentialities. It is absolutely dependent on the eastern and Western Regions for its communications with the coast, but at the same time it has much to contribute to the country as a whole, not only in money and material sources, but through its traditions and its political stability. The new consti-tution must in my view be so drawn up as to give the maximum encouragement to the building of a united Nigeria. For this reason I am anxious to do all I canto encourage the three Regions to reach agreement on the one outstanding point,and I am advised that the Governor would be much assisted in securing this result if I were to send him a despatch for publication in the near future informing him that, subject to a satisfactory settlement of this one outstanding issue and tofurther examination of certain points of detail, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe willing to accept the recommendations of the General Conference as amended by the Select Committee of the Legislative Council.10. I am sure that these proposals can safely be accepted. The schemewhich is put forward succeeds, in my view, in creating the relationship betweenthe centre and the Regions which is best suited to the present stage of develop-ment. It provides for a more representative method of selecting members of the regional Houses without importing a system of direct election which would notwork under present Nigerian conditions. It gives Nigerians a large share ofresponsibility for the formation and execution of policy both at. the centre andin the Regions, while leaving the ultimate responsibility for policy, and the meansof exercising that responsibility if necessary, in the hands of the Governor throughthe reserve powers which, as explained in paragraph 5 (d), he would still possessin relation both to the Executive Council and the legislature. The scheme repre-sents a logical development of the existing constitution, which was designed, topromote regional development within a unified Nigeria. In the extent to whichit would transfer power to Africans it is similar to the scheme recently approved for the Gold Coast, although it goes slightly less far than that scheme. above all, it is a scheme recommended by the representatives of the people of Nigeriaafter long and detailed consultation. I am assured that the great majority ofthe people of Nigeria would accept the scheme, although the extremists would no doubt say that it does not go far enough.11. Subject to the concurrence of my colleagues therefore I propose to send a despatch to the Governor in the terms indicated at the end of paragraph 9 above.I should propose that this despatch should be published at a date to be agreed with the Governor and I would then make an announcement in the House ofCommons.J. G.Colonial Office, S.W.1,3rd May, 1950.
