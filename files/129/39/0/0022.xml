Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950Copy No.CABINETMEALS IN ESTABLISHMENTS order memorandum by the Minister of food. I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the revocation of the Meals inEstablishments Order, which : (i) restricts the amount of food that may be served as a meal by :  (a) limiting the number of courses to three; and(b) prohibiting the inclusion of more than one main dish;(ii) places a formal limit on the amount charged for the meal.The principal effects of the restrictions on the size of the meal are to make itillegal to serve fish as well as meat in a single meal and to prevent the service ofcheese as well as a sweet.2. My colleagues will remember that the Order has long been a source of controversy. As the conditions of wartime scarcity which gave rise to it havereceded, criticism and pressure for its revocation have grown, in spite of consider-able relaxation of its terms. Revocation&apos; was considered by Ministers in june and November last (P.C. (49) 15th Meeting, Minute 2 and E.P.C. (49) 43rd Meet-ing, Minute 1 (b)) but was rejected. My predecessor supported these decisions,but recommended that the position should be reviewed early in 1950, and in Octoberpromised the representatives of the Tourist and Catering Industries that thisshould be done in time for the next tourist season, i.e., by April 1950.3. In reply to a recent Parliamentary Question, I felt bound to confirm that promise and I have therefore reviewed, in the light of present conditions,the case for and against the revocation of the Order, taking full account of thereasons underlying the decisions of last June and November. In view of these decisions I have set out in detail the considerations which have led me torecommend this step.4. The Order was introduced in 1942 because of public feeling againstluxury feeding in wartime and served, until last year at least, as a real protection for the public against rising prices in hotels and restaurants and pre-emptivebuying of the scarcer unrationed foods by expensive restaurants. In the last twelve months the necessity for such protection has largely disappeared and theOrder has now become a mere symbol, rather than an effective instrument of thepolicy of &quot; fair shares.&quot;5. Nevertheless, in times of war or economic crisis, when a measure ofsacrifice or restraint is demanded of the public, the social and political significance of an Order which applies or purports to apply a measure of austerity to all mayjustify its retention after its period of usefulness as a necessary control is over.The effect of the revocation of the Order on public feeling cannot therefore be overlooked. That is the brief but substantial case for the retention of the order under review.6. But the arguments for revocation are formidable. The restrictions out-lined in paragraph 1, which, in circumstances of wartime scarcity, secured ameasure of rough social justice, are now, in changed conditions, having the opposite effect.SECRETCP. (50) 72I9tk April, 195038585
(a) The ban on serving fish as well as meat is no longer protective but posi-tively prejudicial to the interests of the fish and catering industries and their customers, the general public. Even during the winter months there has been difficulty in selling all the fish available, andthe industry is anxious about the prospects of marketing the wholecatch satisfactorily over the next few months, and favours revocation.My colleagues will remember that we are about to abandon all controlover the marketing of fish.(b) There is no longer any purpose in preventing a caterer from supplyingcheese as well as a sweet to his customers. Caterers cannot increase their off-take of the rationed varieties of cheese, since this is limited bypermits. There is a plentiful supply of the unrationed varieties, the blue vein cheeses and the soft cheeses, which have been freed fromall control, so that the enforced austerity of the Order is no longer necessary and applies not only to luxury establishments but also topopular ones catering for the general public, who suffer accordingly.(c) The 5s. maximum price may well, in present circumstances of disinfla-tionary pressure and increased competition, be tending to check the competitive downward price of meals in the great majority of catering establishments. It is strongly urged that there is no question of an upward movement, since popular establishments, i.e., the vast majority,barely maintain their turnover at present prices, and by setting acommon maximum the Order tends to discourage individualreductions.7. In the case of the minority of luxury establishments the 5s. limit has beenmade ridiculous by a whole series of permitted additions, including a house charge,assessed ad hoc for each establishment, a service charge of Qd. for each 5s. of thetotal bill, 4s. when oysters are served, 2s. Qd. per head for use of a private room,a charge for cabaret or dancing, charges for drinks, charges for coffee. In these establishments, therefore, each diner tends to get, apart from drinks, much thesame bill irrespective of what he has eaten, so that, as the hotel managers have themselves pointed out, the man who chooses inexpensive dishes is subsidising themore expensive dishes served to someone else.8. For tourists in particular this system must be peculiarly irritating, andI need only remind my colleagues of the report of the Working Group on Tourismcirculated with E.P.C. (49) 131 of 10th November, 1949, which stated &quot; The systemof a 5s. meal limit, plus a system of supplementary charges, together with therestriction on the number of courses served, is a real cause of annoyance to visitors.Many resent not being allowed to order and pay for as much as they like. On theother hand, the complicated system by which restaurant bills are now built up leadsmany tourists to suspect that they are being exploited, if not actually cheated.&quot;9. The Order has always been most difficult to enforce, the more so since theforegoing relaxations were introduced. Infringement by restaurants in favourof &apos;&apos; known customers &apos;&apos; is widespread and almost impossible to prevent. TheOrder can also be evaded without difficulty by making high charges for coffee anddrinks, and by clubs which recoup themselves by high membership and guest fees.Any further relaxations, e.g., to cater for tourists, will make the exceptions con-conspicuously greater than the rule, will make the Order impossible to defend andenforce, and thus bring the law into disrepute. Establishments which complystrictly With the provisions of the Order already claim with justice that they arethereby placed at a disadvantage.10. I fully recognise that the proposal to revoke the Order would have tobe presented to the Trade Union movement and to the public in general with great care, if it is not to meet with hostility and misrepresentation in some quarters.Indeed, the case for the retention of the Order rests solely on the effect whichrevocation might have on the present delicate balance of our internal economicsituation. If we could make sure that this effect would not be appreciable, then the case for revocation would in my view be established. Two possible safeguardshave been suggested to me : - (a) The Small Consultative Committee of the Catering Trade have repre-sented that the vast majority of caterers, including all the &quot; house-hold names,&quot; would be willing to put their names to a statement that
Ministry of Food, S.W. 1\%th April, 1950the abolition of the Order will not result in any general increase in price, and would agree to its publication simultaneously with theannouncement of revocation.(b) To encourage competition in respect of catering prices and service, weshould now complete the process of relaxation of control that has been going on since May 1949 by allowing any bona fide applicant to opena catering establishment. This step could also be announced simul-taneously with revocation of the Order.11. I believe that these two measures, together with careful public presenta-tion, would largely safeguard us against adverse public reactions, and I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to revocation of the Meals in Establishments order as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. The parallel restrictions on public functions imposed under the Meals (Service at Social Functions) Order,which prohibits, except under specific authorisation from the Ministry, the serviceof meals to parties numbering more than 100, if the charge to be made exceeds atotal of 12s. 6d. per head, including not more than 5s. for the meal itself, shouldbe removed at the same time.12. I would also make two further suggestions which I have considered inthe light of possible anxieties which the abandonment of the limit might arouse : (a) We could announce the change as an experimental one for the period ofthe tourist traffic and undertake to review it in September and decide,in the light of experience, whether to reimpose it or finally get rid ofit. This method would, I feel, secure the full co-operation of the catering trade in preventing any abuses.(&amp;) To guard against the risk of some unrationed goods being drawn away from the domestic consumer by this change, we should require the responsible organisations of the catering trade to make appropriatepublic pledges on behalf of their members that they will themselveswatch the situation closely and deal with any evidence of abuse. Ihave discussed this project with the catering trade&apos;s spokesmen andthey are ready to take any action on these lines which we feel to benecessary. Similarly, they are also prepared to give public assurance about avoiding unjustified inflation of prices, if there was any feeling that it was needed. Personally, I am satisfied that the normal impact of competitive forces will take care of prices.M. W.
