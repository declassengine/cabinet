O this  DOCUMENT 18  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50; 5630TH MARCH.  1950CABINETINCREASE IN SCALES OP NATIONAL assistance memorandum &quot;by the Minister, of National insurance have received, from the National Assistance Boardproposals for increases in their scales of assistance.   Thedetails are set out in Appendix TB&apos;  of the attached memorandum prepared by the Board.2. In accordance with custom these proposals are submitted informally at this stage in order that the views ofthe Government may be ascertained.    If they are acceptable theywould be embodied by the Board in draft Regulations, vrtiich I shallhave to submit to both Houses of parliament for approval by affirmative resolution.3* The Board, I understand,  only refrained reluctantlyfrom putting forward proposals at the end of last year.   Theyhave now decided that the increase in the cost of living,and particularly in the cost of food, has been such that anincrease in the scales is necessary.II. The Board&apos;s present rates were approved in theearly summer of 1948, when the published index figure of retail prices was 1C8.    Tho current index figure is 113*    the increases proposed in the main rates are from 2k/- a week fora single householder to 26/- a week;    and from 2+0/- a week for a couple to k3/6d. a week.   Actual rent paid must beadded to those figures.5. Those increases considerably exceed an amount relatedstrictly to the overall increase in the index figure of retail prices since tho present rates wore last settled - just under 5 per cent.    Tho increases proposed in the main rates are just under 9 per cent.6. The Board argue very cogently, however, inparagraphs 7 to 9 of their memorandum,  to which I would draw the special attention of my colleagues,  that in discharging their responsibilities they must have special regard to theamounts spent by those on the subsistence level on such itemsas food, fuel and clothing.    On this basis they conclude thatin view of to-day&apos;s prices increases of the order proposed are required.7, I feol bound to accept this argument.    1 think thatwe should accept too the argument in paragraph 11 of theBoard&apos;s memorandum that it would be wrong to attempt in any proposals now put forward to anticipate further increases inthe cost of living.    No credit is over allowed for suchanticipation and whatever provision any proposals now putforward may purport to make for future increases in the cost ofliving, they will always &quot;be made a jumping-off point for newdemands related to actual conditions at the time when theproposals wore first made public.COPY NO.SI

8. The immediate cost of the proposals as set out inparagraph 12 of the Board&apos;s memorandum is about  8-g- millions a year.   But after making an allowance for new applicantslikely to be attracted by the increase in scales, the Boardestimate that the additional cost will soon reach  10 millions a year.:    The Board&apos;s total estimate for the year 1950-51 isabout  8JU. millions, of which  54? 900,000 is expenditure on assistance, without taking into account the new proposals.9* I have looked witli special care at the possiblereaction of the new rates on the national insurance ratesgenerally.   The main insurance benefit rates for purposes of comparison are 26/- for a- single man. and h-2/- for a married couple without special provision for rent.   The proposedassistance rates of 26/- and h3/6d. exclusive of rentobviously widen the field for the supplementation of insurance benefit &quot;by assistance.    But the possibility of supplementationhas existed for the last two years.    In fact, supplementationin the pension field has not been unduly heavy - about 650,000cases at present out of some h million contributory pensioncases of various kinds;    and supplementation of sickness benefit - about 95*000 cases out of over 1 million personsreceiving sickness benefit at the moment - is modest,    v/e mustbe prepared, for some increases in these figures if the new rates are brought into force, but not,  if past and current experience is a correct guide, on a scale likely to coll into seriousquestion the insurance rotes.   Pressure for putting up these rates will, no doubt,  continue and may well increase.   ButI think we ought to be very reluctant to see these rates (and contributions) changed until we have the results of the compre-hensive actuarial review of the working of the insurance scheme.In the meantime there is a good deal to be said for the viewthat the Board&apos;s new rates would help to underpin and maintainthe present structure of the insurance rates *10. I have consulted the chancellor of the Exchequer;    he regards the proposals as acceptable.    The Ministry of Labourand the Ministry of Pensions are aware of the proposals and have raised no objection on grounds of reaction on Departmentalpolicies.    The Ministry of Labour are interested in the timing and form of any public announcementsC one lug ions a nd re c oi j : icnda t ion11. In my view the Board&apos;s proposals are rightly based.There is,  I think,  a strong current of public opinion,irrespective of party,  in favour of some improvement inassistance scales, particularly so far as old age pensionerswithout other resources are concerned.   The increases proposed should,  I think, meet the views of all reasonable people on this score.    Nor do I think that they are likely to prove a threat to the stability of the insurance scheme-I would like my colleagues&apos;  authority accordingly to lot the Assistance Board know that their proposals are acceptable.    I should also like authority to make an announce-ment in the House before the Recess.    This would bo a simplestatement to the effect that I understand I shall be receivingdraft Regulations from the Board shortly after the Recess.Ministry of National insurance,  S.W.I.,30TH MARCH,  1950.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALNational Assistance;    the scale ratesNote to the Minister......of.,Jfat,ional........Insurance........fr,aa.th^National- Assistance BoardSt at ut g ry, Re gul at ions1,     in dooiding whether a person who applies to then, is: in need ofassistance under the National Assistance Act, 1548, and, if he is in need,how much assistance should be granted him, the Board&apos;s officers have to guide themselves; by Statutory Regulations which, though they do notpurport to give the exact answer in every case, provide such, an answer instraightforward cases; and establish, a general, standard for cases which arenot straightforward,    The procedure, for making: Regulations, is. prescribed in section 6 of the Act.   The present. Regulations- were cade, &quot;tag- the minister on 22nd June, 1?48, to cone, into operation on 5th July, 1548, being, the dayan which the; National Assistance Act cane into operation.Theg current scale rates2.     The most important; figures, in the Regulations are the &quot;&quot;sealsrates&quot;1 representing the weekly amounts which it is assumed will normally be needed for requirements other than rent;;    and this note is concerned,exclusively with those rates since no change is being; proposed in other respects, e. g. the provisions for talcing, account of resources, most of whichare in fact, settled by the. Act itself.    The most important scale, rates arethose for a married couple (at present, 43s. Od.) and. for a householder whois unmarried or&apos; widowed (at present 24s. Od, ):    to these, rates have to beadded an allowance for rent, and the scale rates for any dependent children.Thus in the. case of a married couple without resources paying a rent of1-5s. Od. and having- a child aged 8 (present scale, rate 9s. Od.)&apos; the allowance payable would normally be 40s. Od. * 9s. Od. + 15s. Od, ^ 64s.a week,   if there were special circumstances more might be given, e.g, ifthe wife were ill it might be necessary to add something for the cost of extra nourishment and possibly domestic help.    On the other hand, if there,were: resources not, required to be disregarded (e. g. an insurance benefit)the allowance would bo reduced accordingly,, /-?

3.     In accordance with a direction in ths Act (section 5(3)) theRegulations have to make special provision for the blind and for certain persons suffering from respiratory tuberculosis, and roughly speaking anadditional &quot;I5s.0d. a week is allowed for the requirements of persons inthese two special classes.   Otherwise the same set of scale rates apply inall cases:    thoy are sot out in paragraph 2 of Part I of the Schedule tothe Regulations, which is substantially repeated in Appendix B to this note.4.     These figures wore fixed as recently as June, 1548, and represented at the time an appreciable improvement over the figures previousoperative for unemployment assistance and supplementary pensions (e.g.married couples generally benefitted by at least 5s.Od. a week and singlepersons by 4s.Od.).    There has, however, lately been considerable pressure for themto be increased on the ground that the rise in prices has made theminadequate.Recent increases in cost of living5.     The official evidence about changes in the prices of food,clothing, etc., is contained in figures published by the Ministry of Labour:and the separate figures for food, clothing, etc., are combined &quot;by theMinistry into an &quot;index of retail prices&quot;.    This index has been publishedsince the summer of 1547, when it replaced the old &quot;cost of living index&quot;:it is the index which is referred to in those wages agreements which aretied to the level of prices.    Ths Table in Appendix A to this Note gives the published figures (in terms of July, 1547 = &quot;100) for recent months andfor the summer months of 1548.   The figures in the column on the extremeleft of the Table give the &quot;weights&quot; by reference to which the. Ministrycombine the separate figures for food, clothing, etc., to give the &quot;all-items&quot; figure in the bottom line:    it is this last-mentioned figure whichis published as the index of retail prices.6.     The present Regulations were approved by parliament, and made bythe Minister, in June, 1548.   The all-items figure for mid-June, 1548, was110, but this figure was 2 points higher than the figures for the months immediately preceding and succeeding.    It would therefore be misleading to base the comparison on that figure.    The proper starting point is the figure/of

of 108 for May and July.    The all-items figure for January, 1550, was 113,and 4the rise from 108 to 113 is 4.6 par cant.Effect of increased cost of living on assistance rates7.     Tho result of applying an increase of 4.6 per cent to the mainscale rates of 40s.Od. (married couple) and 24s.0d.  (single- householder)would be to increase the 40s.Od.  rate by 1s.10d. and the 24s.0d.  rate by1s.1d,    It has, however, been represented to the Board that the rise in theall-items figure is not an adequate measure of the extra amount which old people and others living on assistance now have to spend in order tomaintain the standard of living provided by the present scale rates at thetime when they came into operation.    A number of Members of Parliament whowere received by the Board on   7th December last contended that in the Ministryof Labour calculations the weight given to food is too small and the weightgiven to drink and tobacco and &quot;services&quot; is too large for people livingat assistance standards.    They proceeded to argue that these elements,together with rent (which does not enter into the calculation of the scalerates as it is added separately), should be excluded from the cost ofliving computation and that an index should be compiled relating simply tothe remaining items, namely food, clothing, fuel and light, household goods, and miscellaneous goods.    The Board can express no view about the compilation of a special index for a particular purpose.    They fully recognise the dangers and difficulties of so doing and they do not knowwhether the kind of adjustments suggested would provide a statisticallyvalid index.    They have,    however, felt bound tc examine the weighting inthe official index, which is based on the ascertained pattern ofexpenditure of working-class families in 1937-38, to see whether it is inaooordance with the probable distribution of the expenditure of personsnow living on assistance.8.     According to the official weighting, out of the current rate of40s.Od. for the&apos;needs other than rent of a married couple,  15s.3d. would be spent on food and 5s.6d.  on drink and tobacco.    Obviously 15s.3d,  is insufficient for food for two people, just as 5s.6d.  is excessive for theirdrink and tobaoco if they are dependent on assistance.    When they wereframing the present Regulations the Board assumed that a couple living on/their

their own would need to spend not less than about 22s.Od. a week on food,and this assumption is supported by the results of enquiries which theMinistry of Food have made into the actual expenditure of old age pensioners in 1947 and 1543.    The Table in Appendix A shows that betweenJuly, 1548, and January, 1550s the Ministry of Labour index figure for food rose from 108.2 to 120.3, or about 11.2 per cent.   The Board know ofno reason for not accepting this figure in relation to the food expenditureof persons living on assistance, and the implication is that the additionalamount required to buy at the present tine food which cost 22s.Od, a week in the summer of 1548,would be 2s.5d. a week.   Allowing (say) an extra Ad.a week, for clothing (the index figure for which has risen by 6.8 per cent),an extra 3d. a week for fuel (rise of 3.5 per cent) and an extra 3d. a week for sundries, the total addition needed to the scale rate of 40s.Od. is3s.3d.   A similar calculation applied to the scale rate of 24s.Od, for asingle person leads, on the assumption that food would ordinarily absorb11s.6d. out of the 24s.Od., to an increase of about 2s.Od,    It seems very doubtful whether the Board can reasonably attempt to abate these estimatesby any saving from the reduction in the price of beer in April, 1545, whichhas damped the rise in the retail prices index to the extent of more than half a point.The Board&apos;s conclusions .     These considerations have led the Board to the conclusion that,unless persons living on assistance are to be obliged to exist at a lowerstandard than was contemplated when the present rates were fixed in 1548,it will be necessary to make increases of the order indicated in the last preceding paragraph.    Though the Board regarded the rates fixed in 1548 as adequate in the then circumstances, they never considered that those ratesleft much margin.    It is accordingly considered that the rate of AOs.Od.should be increased by 3s.6d, to 43s. 6d. , arid the rate of 24s.Od. by 2s, Od.to 26s.Od.10.     The Board think that the other rates also need to be revised,i.e.  the rates for adult non-householders, adolescents, dependent children/and

and the special rates for blind and certain tuberculous persons.   Appendix Bwill show the Minister what the complete scale would look like if it wererevised in accordance with the Board&apos;a provisional conclusions.Possibility of continued rise in prices &apos;11..     The Board wish to bring to the Minister&apos;s attention a point whichis causing them some concern.    They are satisfied that increases of the ordersuggested are now required, but once new rates are settled and approved byParliament they ought to be such as will operate satisfactorily for aconsiderable period.   Prices may, however, continue to rise.    In the Board&apos;view it would be wrong to propose to Parliament rates which anticipate futurepossibilities;    apart from the consideration that anticipations may not beborne out, whatever rates are adopted will inevitably be related subsequently to the circumstances existing at the time they were settled.    The Board have come to the conclusion, therefore, that despite the risk mentioned,  theproper course is to make such provision as is needed now.Cost12.     Assistance is being paid in nearly 1,200,000 cases (in nearly900,000 of them in supplementation of pensions and insurance benefits).   Thecost in relation to 1,200,000 cases of the increases which the Board have inmind would be of the order of  8g millions a year.    It is, however, certainthat improved scales will lead to additional applications from persons(particularly persons with pensions and insurance benefits) who on the presentstandards are not entitled to assistance, or who are entitled to assistanceof so small an amount that they do not think it worth while to apply.    Thecurrent scales are already better on the whole than the retirement pension and other insurance benefits, e,g, 24s,0d, plus rent compared with 26s.Od. allin, and 40s.Od. plus rent compared with 42s. Od, all in, so that any increasein assistance must put large numbers of pensioners,  etc., in a position toapply for an assistance supplement:    how many will apply is pure guesswork,but it would not be surprising if before very long the additional costapproached . 10 million a year.   As the estimates for National Assistance for1550/51 have been framed on the basis of the present Regulations any increasein expenditure due to new scales and the &quot;attraction&quot; arising from them willhave to be covered eventually by a supplementary estimate.National Assistance Board18th March, 1550
