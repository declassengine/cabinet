Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1950SECRET Copy No32CP. (50) 69\Uh April, 1950CABINETADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DISPLACED PERSONS INTOTHE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Home Secretary1. At the third (special) session of the General Council of the InternationalRefugee Organisation plans were approved for winding up the Organisation bythe end of June 1950. It has since been agreed that the Organisation may con-tinue its activities for a further nine months in so far as these consist of disposing of persons already in its care at June 1950. But we must assume that the workof the Organisation will be effectively at an end by 30th June and the Organisa-tion estimates that at that date there will still be some 150,000 to 160,000 displaced persons in its care.2. In approving the winding-up plans the General Council called on all governments who are members of the Organisation and on all Governments ofgood will to help the Organisation by doing &quot; all in their power to extend theirrefugee immigration programmes and to liberalise in the broadest manner theirselection and admission standards.&quot; But no formal request has been made to individual Governments to absorb any fixed number of the 160,000, though the officials of the Organisation have made informal approaches to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and to other Governments.It has been hoped that an amendment of the United States immigration lawwill permit the admission to the United States of some 100,000 of those remaining in the charge of the Organisation next June, but the amending legislation hasnot yet been passed and may well be subject to qualifications (e.g., a requirement that a large number of the immigrants should be fit for employment in agri-culture) which will make it impossible for anything like 100,000 to secure admis-sion. The United Kingdom and other western European countries have hithertotaken the view that any displaced persons who cannot be absorbed into othercountries before the Organisation ceases to function must remain as a charge on Germany and Austria, and the Foreign Secretary reaffirmed this view in theforeign affairs debate on 28th March (Hansard, Col. 326). But there will obviously be difficulties in settling any large number of displaced persons in Germany and.Austria, and it is almost certain that before long the United Kingdom will be subjected to strong pressure to do something to meet the General Council&apos;s appeal.3. During the past few months officials of the International RefugeeOrganisation have made a number of informal approaches to United kingdon departments and, at a meeting with the Permanent Under-Secretary of State atthe Home Office on 2nd March, Mr. Kingsley, the Director-General of theOrganisation, made some suggestions about the form which any United kingdom contribution might take. Mr. Kingsley then stated that, in his view, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government, in addition to whatever measures they might take,to dealwith the 2,600 or so Poles in International Refugee Organisation camps in EastAfrica and the Lebanon, for whom His Majesty&apos;s Government will have a directfinancial responsibility on the winding up of the International Refugee Organisa-tion, were to authorise the admission of up to 2,000 of the hard core of displaced persons in International Refugee Organisation camps in Germany and Austria,they would have made a fair contribution to the solution of the refugee problem&apos;38561 B
4. Mr. Kingsley&apos;s views have been discussed by the Home Office with the otherDepartments mainly concerned and I deal with them in paragraphs 6 to 13 below.I should, however, like my colleagues to consider in the first place three general questions-,       (i) whether the United Kingdom should make any further contribution;f.      (ii) if so, whether the action proposed by Mr. Kingsley can fairly be regardedas adequate; and(iii) whether tactically it is to our advantage to make an offer of help at thisstage.5. As regards the first question, the record of the United Kingdom in the admission of refugees is good. In the 1930&apos;s we admitted some 80,000 refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, and many of these were assisted outof public funds; we have since the end of the war allowed over 120,000 Poles tosettle in this country, and we have admitted, mainly from International RefugeeOrganisation camps, over 80,000 European volunteer workers, the great majorityof whom will remain in this country. In addition, over 8,000 Ukrainianex-prisoners of war were allowed to remain here on their discharge from militarycustody, on the same conditions as European volunteer workers, and some5,000 persons, who as a result of the war were living in distressed circumstances,have been allowed to join their relatives in the United Kingdom.On the other hand, it may be argued that in the main we have since the waradmitted to this country only those who would help our economy; and, though in accepting Poles and distressed relatives of persons resident here this has not beenthe criterion, it is undoubtedly true that our admission of European volunteerworkers has been primarily in our own interest.My own view is that we ought to make some contribution, though a strictly limited one, to the disposal of the hard core of refugees and the main purpose ofthis memorandum is to ask my colleagues to consider what that contribution should be.On the second question it seems to me, looking to what we have done already,that if we accept a further 4,000 to 5,000 refugees, most of whom will be of no immediate benefit to our economy, we shall have done more than our share to solve the post-war refugee problem.As regards the tactical point, I have indicated in paragraph 1 above that thereis every prospect that when the activities of the International Refugee Organisa-tion come to an end they will still have a large number of refugees on their hands. Thus, a critical situation may then arise in which the pressure on us togive further help will be in no way diminished by our having already made the limited contribution proposed by the Director-General of the Organisation. Onthe other hand, if we take the initiative now, we can deal with the problem in amore orderly way and, provided that we make our position clear from the outset, it should be possible to resist further pressure.Polish Refugees in East Africa and the Lebanon6. These refugees are the residue of a very much greater group of Poleswho, under an agreement between Marshals Stalin and Sikorsky, entered theMiddle East from Russia in 1942. The men were embodied in the Polish SecondCorps, and their dependants were temporarily settled in various territories in or near the Middle East. When the Polish Second Corps was moved in 1946 from italy to the United Kingdom some 30,000 of their dependants were admitted to theUnited Kingdom, and of these some 15,000 came from East Africa and theMiddle East. Of those not admitted, a number were resettled elsewhere by theInternational Refugee Organisation and there now remain 1,698 in Uganda and tanganyka, and 938 in the Lebanon. The arrangements for the temporary settle-ment of dependants in East Africa and the Lebanon provided that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would bear the cost of their maintenance, though the international organisations for refugees, including latterly the International Refugee Organisa-tion, have contributed substantially to this expenditure. With the terminationof the care and maintenance activities of the International Refugee organisation on 30th June, 1950, the whole cost of these refugees will again become chargeable to tlis Majesty&apos;s Government.The Foreign and Colonial Secretaries are satisfied that the statements whichhave been made to the Colonial and Lebanese Government render it impossible
for His Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid responsibility for the future of these refugees; and so far as concerns the East African territories, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are pledged to take the Poles away after the war.In the appendix to this memorandum are statistics given by the ColonialOffice and the Foreign Office showing the composition of the two groups. since these persons have failed to find a settlement locally, pr in other countries whichhave sent immigration missions there, it is likely that most of them will be of no value to the United Kingdom as immigrants, and will be a burden on us for someyears to come.7. So far as the Poles in East iVfrica are concerned, I understand it to bethe view of the Colonial Office that there is no hope of persuading the colonial governments (who have already absorbed considerable numbers) to retain: thewhole of the refugees, even though the United Kingdom Government were willingto pay for their maintenance. The Colonial Office are, however, prepared to press for the retention in East Africa of some 20 persons who are either mentalcases or bedridden, on the understanding that the United Kingdom Governmentwill be responsible for their maintenance.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not pledged to remove from the Lebanonthe Poles who are there and the Foreign Office are satisfied that the LebanonGovernment would be willing to let all these Poles remain in their territory ifHisMajesty&apos;s Government continued to pay for their maintenance. The Treasury,however, see considerable objections to leaving all these Poles in the Lebanon,where their prospects of becoming self-supporting are poor and where, owing tothe exchange rate, the cost of maintaining them is high. It may be that, inview of these objections, we shall have to admit to the United Kingdom the bulkof the Poles in the Lebanon, but it seems to me that we should at least arrange with the Lebanon Government to retain in the Lebanon at the expense of FlisMajesty&apos;s Government all persons requiring accommodation in institutions andto deport direct to Poland any persons with bad criminal records.9. If it is agreed that we should accept these Polish refugees from EastAfrica and, possibly, from the Lebanon, the problems of providing for them inthis country can best be solved by regarding them as eligible for the benefits pro-vided by the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947 (except for financial assistance underSection 7 for emigration to other countries). when  that Act was before Parlia-ment we had no notion that we should at this late date have to accept a furtherinflux of Poles, and it will be necessary for me to retract some of the statementsI then made about our intention to limit the scope of the Act to certain definedclasses. Moreover, if we extend the benefits of the Act to the Poles from EastAfrica or the Lebanon, some 26,000 Poles who came to this country as Europeanvolunteer workers in 1948 and 1949 will claim similar treatment, and we shallhave some difficulty in resisting this claim. Notwithstanding these difficultiesI can see no other convenient way of providing for these persons.10. It is desirable that any Poles in East Africa and the Lebanon who areto come to the United Kingdom should be brought here before June 1950, whenthe services of the International Refugee Organisation will still be available.When they reach this country it will be necessary to accommodate them in transitcamps, and a working party under Home Office chairmanship is considering what arrangements are necessary for this purpose.Displaced Persons from Camps in Germany and Austria11. The hard core of displaced persons in the camps in Austria andGermany consists largely of (i) aged people, some of whom require treatment in institutions;(ii) employable persons who are over the age limits for Ministry of Labourpermits (50 for men and 55 for women);(iii) disabled persons who do not require institutional treatment and canearn their own living;(iv) persons who, because of disability or disease, require institutional treat-ment (these include over 10,000 tubercular cases);(v) unaccompanied children;(vi) unmarried mothers with their children.About 1,400 of the persons in these classes are believed to have relatives in theUnited Kingdom.38561 b 2
12. The first question for decision is whether, assuming that we are to make some contribution, we should (a) limit ourselves to admitting only those refugees who can find accommo-dation and maintenance with relatives, friends, private persons or voluntary organisations who are prepared to take continuing responsi-bility for them; or(&amp;) also admit a number of refugees who have no sponsors in this countryand for whom the Government would have to provide accommodation,maintenance, education, &amp;c, at public expense.The general view of Departments is against (6), which would mean that some public authority (e.g., the National Assistance Board) would have to providedirectly for the refugees, and, since this would involve recurrent expenditure outof public funds, the public authority would have to be empowered to do so bynew legislation. There could be no question of bringing such persons within thescope of the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947.If our contribution is limited as suggested in (a) it may turn out thatconsiderably fewer than 2,000 will qualify for admission, but I see no objectionto proceeding on this basis, which is, I understand, similar to that adopted inthe United States and other countries and is understood by the Foreign Officeto be acceptable to the International Refugee Organisation. I would therefore suggest that the Cabinet should authorise me to grant up to 2,000 visas to persons for whom relatives, friends, other private persons or voluntary organisations will assume a continuing responsibility. I shall have to satisfy myself in each case that the sponsor will in fact discharge his responsibilities, and I propose that before a visa is granted to any person he should be seen by an Immigration officer in Germany or Austria.13. The second question is whether we should exclude from the schemesrefugees of any of the types listed in paragraph 11. There is general agreement among Departments that no persons in class (i) who need institutional treatment and no persons at all in class (iv) should be admitted to the United Kingdom,and I should propose to exclude such persons altogether. As regards classes (iii)and (vi) disabled persons and unmarried mothers the Ministry of Labour andthe Ministry of Health have drawn attention to our difficulties in finding workfor our own disabled and to the problem of finding work and accommodation forunmarried mothers in places where they can have their children with them; andit has been suggested that such persons should be granted visas only if it is clearthat their sponsors will provide for them in such a way as to avoid their becoming a responsibility of the Ministry of Labour for placing in employment. I am prepared to accept this stipulation and, subject to it, I think that disabled persons and unmarried mothers need not be altogether banned if there are compassionate grounds and it is clear that they have good prospects of private settlement in theUnited Kingdom. I should also, in considering applications for visas for children, keep in mind the need to avoid putting an unreasonable strain on the schools in particular areas.14.   To sum up, the points for decision are (1) Should His Majesty&apos;s Government at this stage offer to make a contribu-tion towards the solution of the problems that will be left on the disappearance of the International Refugee Organisation ?(2) Should the Poles now in East Africa, other than mental cases and bed-ridden cases, be brought to the United Kingdom?(3) Should the Lebanon Government be asked to retain all the Poles now intheir territory, on the understanding that the United Kingdom willprovide for their maintenance, or should these Poles, except institu-tional cases and persons with bad criminal records, be brought to theUnited Kingdom?(4) Should Poles admitted to this country from East Africa or the Lebanonbe provided for under the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947 ?(5) Should a scheme for the admission of up to 2,000 displaced persons fromcamps in Germany and Austria on the lines suggested in paragraphs 12and 13 be adopted ?T C EHome Office, S.W. 1,15th April, 1950.
