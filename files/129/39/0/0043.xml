Printed for the Cabinet.  May I960SECRET Copy No.     32CP. (50) 93m May, 1950CABINETAUSTRIAN treaty memorandum by the Secretary oe State eor Foreign affairs with reference to CP. (50) 66 of 11th April, I now set out, for the informa-tion of my colleagues, the position of the Austrian Treaty negotiations as itemerges from the last meeting of the Deputies and from discussions with UnitedStates and French officials.. ; 2. At the last Deputies&apos; meeting on 26th April, the Soviet representativeadopted a particularly discouraging attitude. My colleagues will recall that theSoviet Government had made the settlement of certain of the oustanding articlesdependent on the settlement of their own claims against Austria in Article 48 bis,in. regard to which separate Austro-Soviet negotiations were begun in Viennalast autumn.. On 26th April the Soviet Deputy not only refused to discussArticle 48 bis or to give information about the Austro-Soviet negotiations, butdeclined to give any assurance that if the other four outstanding articles were settled, 48 bis would also be settled, or to renew the assurances he had given inthe past regarding the settlement of Articles 42 and 48 once Soviet interests hadbeen met in the other articles (as they have been). Furthermore, the Soviet Deputyread a long statement accusing the Austrian Government of failure to carry outthe laws and regulations regarding the denazification and demilitarisation ofAustria, and accusing the Western Powers of blocking Soviet attempts to ventilatethese matters in the Allied Council in Vienna. He then tabled an addition to the already agreed Article 9 of the Treaty, which deals with the dissolution of Naziorganisations.3. This action by the Soviet Deputy, and the attitude of the Soviet Govern-ment which it represents, makes it difficult for me any longer to nourish the hopethat agreement on the Austrian Treaty can now be won by further concessions from the Western Powers. We must, I fear, conclude that the Soviet Governmenthave no intention of completing the Austrian Treaty until wider political develop-ments make it in their interest to do so. This means that, whatever concessionswe now.make, there is not merely no guarantee but little likelihood that weshall get a Treaty.4.   The present position may therefore be summarised as follows: &apos;.&quot;   (1) The Russians are not at present ready to conclude the Treaty unless wehave first given way on Articles 16, 27, 42 and 48.(2) There is no guarantee whatsoever that when we have given way theywill conclude the Treaty.(3) It is quite possible that they will then either decline to settle Article 48 bis^or will raise fresh difficulties such as the addition that they have nowtabled to Article 9.(4) Discussion of the outstanding articles at the Deputies&apos; Conference will almost certainly lead to the abandonment of our position, and theFrench and Americans agree with us that there should be no settlementof these articles one by one without any return.38678
(5) The French are ready to ask the Soviet Deputy whether acceptance ofT&apos; Articles 16, 27, 42 and 48.will bring about a settlement of Article 48 bis.- &apos;  The Americans and we feel that any such specific offer would irretriev-ably prejudice our position on those articles. &apos;i (6) The Americans&apos; are prepared to settle Articles 42 and 48 provided this, brings with iit a settlement of Article 48 bis. and in the last resortwould seek authority to accept also the Soviet texts for Articles 16and 27 if this would then complete the Treaty.(7) His Majesty&apos;s Government would hope that a new settlement can bereached with the bondholders before the Soviet text for Article 48 is.       i  accepted.     :     , h -      . .. (8) The three Western Delegations agree that if the Russians were to consent to settle Article 48 bis and to conclude the Treaty, we should have tobe prepared to settle the four other articles on the best terms possible.5. What is to be our attitude in the forthcoming discussions with the Frenchand United States Foreign Ministers ?  There are two alternative courses : (a) To settle Articles 16, 27, 42 and 48 (and the new Soviet Article 9) on thebest terms we can get;(6) to decline to settle any of these articles except on our terms unless theRussians agree to settle Article 48 &apos;bis and to complete the Treaty.6.   In favour of the first course are the following arguments : (1) So long as the articles protecting our claims against Austria (42 and 48)remain unsettled, the Russians can represent themselves as champion-ing Austrian interests against the claims of the Western Powers. Theyhave already been taking this line in their propaganda.(2) So long as the Russians are able to point to the existence of other unagreedarticles besides 48 bis, especially those involving Western claims onAustria, it is impossible to make it crystal clear to public opinion,especially in Austria, that the Western Powers are not, partly at least,responsible for holding up the Treaty.(3) Until we have settled Articles 16, 27, 42 and 48, which it is within our power to settle by accepting the Soviet text, we shall not have done all we Can to complete the Treaty.(4) If we settle these four articles the responsibility for holding up the treaty will be placed openly and squarely on the Russians so long as they holdup the settlement of Article 48 bis or raise new difficulties.(5) Until we have settled these four articles the Russians are most unlikelyat present to settle 48 bis and to complete the Treaty.(6) If we settle the four articles the Russians might settle Article 48 bis and complete the Treaty.7.   In favour of course (6) : (1) There is no guarantee, or even likelihood, so long as Soviet policy towardsAustria remains unchanged, that the settlement of these four articleswill bring about the settlement of the whole Treaty.(2) If there were no agreement on the Treaty as a whole the Western powers would for no purpose have accepted texts which are objectionable tothem or prejudicial to their interests.(3) By accepting these four articles we should have abandoned our lastbargaining cards without getting anything in return except somepropaganda value. If and when negotiations are then resumed andthe Soviet raise new demands, as they did on 26th April in regard to article 9, we shall have nothing left to bargain with, though it is only fair to admit that bargaining counters have not proved of much value in the past when it has been our desire to get the Treaty concluded.(4) The propaganda point may have some importance, but what the Austrianswant is to get the four occupying Powers out of the country, and asettlement of the four articles which does not bring this about willhave only temporary propaganda value.(5) Until a new agreement has been concluded between Austria and the bond-holders and the guarantor Powers it would be difficult for His
.. Majesty&apos;s Government to settle Article 48 on the Russian terms with-out laying themselves open to the accusation of having surrendered; other people&apos; s interests, which it is our duty to maintain, in order to accommodate the Russians. -&apos; . -(6) We should have made a further concession to the Soviet for which we getnot return, and this might not be without its influence on our general position in the cold war. i;;r:;&apos;-V\;&apos;;&apos;:.:;\&apos;:&apos; CONCLUSIONS &apos; &quot;8. My opinion is that we should adopt the second course and stick fast toour present position unless and until the Russians are &quot;prepared to settleArticle 48 bis and to agree the whole Treaty. This is the line that I propose totake in the forthcoming discussions with Mr. Acheson and M. Schuman. It isa pity that the French and the Americans should have agreed to make the con-cessions necessary to get the Treaty only after the Russians have ceased to want aTreaty. The fact that the Russians have ceased to want a Treaty has altered thewhole position, and I do not now advocate the making of concessions which are unlikely to serve any useful purpose.. &apos; &apos; - ,    .E.
