(50) 69) on the admission of displaced persons into theUnited Zing&amp;orn, my colleagues may find it useful to have before them the following information regarding the resettle-ment of refugees in other countries.2. During the period of the- International RefugeeOrganisation^ operations (1st July, 1947$ to 28th Februarys1950), 723,445 refugees have been resettled in the followingcountries:-United States	-	160,407Australia	-	124,501Israel	-	117,306Canada	-	80,642France		36,999Argentina	-	28,213Brazil	-	23,422Belgium	-	22,260Venezuela	-	13,351Paraguay Netherlands	-	5,360	-	4,068Chile	-	3,665Sweden	-	3,305Peru	-	2,188Turkey	-	1 ,978French Morocco	-	1 ,285Few Zealand	-	1 ,132Uruguay	-	1 ,136Others docs not tape i .

R. 0.  wereselected by their reception countries as workers, althoughonly in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s &quot;westward Ho&quot; scheme was there any preponderance of persons without family ties.5. Moat countries accepted a much broader definition ofthe term &quot;dependant&quot; than that laid down by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in respect of the admission of relatives of refugeesinto this country.      However, the health requirements of most countries are usually more stringent than those of the UnitedZingdom.      Israel imposes no restrictions whatsoever on immigration of Jewish refugees.      Under the United StatesDisplaced Persons Act, apart from normal quarantine and securityrestrictions and provisos as to the quotas of persons from-1 -

territories annexed, de facto by the U. S. S. R.   and of agri-:.cultural workers (now expected to be waived under amending legislation) there is no restriction as to the age, health or occupational skill of the 205,000 (shortly expected to be344,000). persons for whom visas are to be made available.All that is required is for some individual or organisation to promise to maintain or employ an individual refugee andto provide accommodation,  on the understanding that no UnitedStates citizen shall thereby be deprived of employment orhousing.6. Certain countries have made special provision forrefugees not normally acceptable as emigrant workers.      Forexample, New Zealand has already admitted some 400 orphans,widows with young children and aged persons, and has now agreed to admit without limitation all refugees for whomrelatives in New Zealand can guarantee accommodation andmaintenance.      Australia has also taken a number of motherswith young children as well as unaccompanied youths andchildren.      Canada has admitted a number of unaccompaniedchildren as well as having a scheme for re-uniting relativessimilar to that proposed by New Zealand.      Norway has under-taken to admit at least 100 blind refugees and dependants,while Sweden is- prepared to provide institutional care for anunspecified number of tubercular cases and their families.In Prance, nearly 1,000 aged persons are to be admitted tohomes run by the Little Sisters of the Poor and a similar,but smaller,  scheme is being arranged in Belgium.7- Many Western European countries have now undertakenresponsibility for indigent and unemployable refugees whohave infiltrated over their frontiers and who have hitherto been maintained by I. R. 0.      Prance has over 26,000 such-refugees, Belgium) 1,634, Denmark 1,811, Switzerland 1,300,the Netherlands 141 and Luxembourg 184.      Although no figures are available to show how many refugees are in receipt ofpublic assistance in this country, it seems unlikely that theyare relatively as numerous as they are in most other countries of Western Europe.Iv.
