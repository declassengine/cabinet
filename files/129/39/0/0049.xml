(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50) 999TH MAY,  1950CABINETTHE TEA ration memorandum by the Minister of food at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 8th May I was asked to circulate a paper dealing with the question whether theproposed cut in the tea ration from 2-g ozs.   to 2 ozs. per headper week could be brought into effect from a date early inJune instead of from 21st May as I had proposed.2. I am afraid that this will not be practicable.Consumers actually draw the 2-g- oz.   ration in the form of a3 oz. weekly ration in one four-week period and one of 2 oz.in the next four-week period, and so on.      There is a 3 oz.entitlement in the four-week period beginning on 21st May,a 2 oz.  entitlement in that beginning on 18th June, and thenext 3 oz.  entitlement will be from 16th July:    consumersare, of course, free to buy the whole of their ration entitle-ment at the beginning of the period and frequently do so.It follows that as it will not now be possible toreduce the ration at 21st May, I cannot effect any saving inthe four-week period 21st May - 17th June,  and could onlyeffect a saving in the 2 oz.  entitlement period 18th June -15th July if the ration were reduced in that period to 1  oz.(since the issue of an odd half-ounce in any one month is impracticable).      But to come down to 1  oz.   is,  I am sure,out of the question.      In the circumstances there is no alternative but to arrange for the reduction of the ration totake effect from 16th July.      The fact that we cannot makethe reduction until then will, of course, worsen our stock position by 1k million lbs.3- Accordingly I ask for authority to reduce the domestic ration to the 2 oz.  level from 16th July, and to announce this Impending reduction next week.      As I have explained in C.P.(50) 95,  an announcement that the rationwill be reduced, with a consequent substantial saving in theUnited Kingdom demands,  is urgently necessary to reducepressure on Eastern markets and make producers more ready toenter into contracts with us at the basic prices agreed withthe Governments concerned.M. W.Ministry of Food,  S.W. 1,9TH MAY,  1950.COPY NO.   ^OL
