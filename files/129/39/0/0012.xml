(50) 62ith April, 1950CABINETNATIONALISATION OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES (SCOTLAND)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. At the meeting of the Socialisation of Industries Committee on21st March (S.I. (M) (50) 2nd Meeting, Minute 1) I was invited to submit to theCabinet a paper dealing with the question of the water supplies in Scotland whichcould be considered by my colleagues at the same time as the proposals of theMinister of Health for the nationalisation of water supplies in England andWales.2. The basic facts with regard to water supplies in Scotland are very different from those in England and Wales. In the first place, there are inScotland no private or statutory water companies supplying water to the general public : all local water authorities are either local authorities some of themsupplying water in the territory of other local authorities or water boards formed by voluntary combination of local authorities. Apart from private supplies to individual, and generally isolated, properties, the few private supplies that existare provided by estates (for domestic purposes) or occasionally by industry forits own use. In the second place, the configuration of the country, with its wealthof natural catchment areas relatively near the centres of population, makes itcomparatively easy where necessary to secure combinations. In the third place,Scottish authorities cannot be said to have failed in their duty to provide publicwater supplies at reasonable cost, and authorities are, indeed, responding well to the stimulus of the  20 million grant for rural localities authorised by theWater Supplies and Sewerage Act, 1944.3. In these circumstances, I do not consider that there is any convincingcase for the nationalisation of Scottish water supplies a course which would meet with strong opposition from Scottish local authorities.4. I do, however, feel that in the existing organisation there is room for improvement, particularly in the direction of wider areas of administration. Itis true that there is at present in Scottish water legislation provision for voluntary and compulsory combination, and some voluntary schemes are in fact comingalong. But an amendment of the present law, designed to strengthen the powersof the Secretary of State to secure compulsory combination, seems to me to bedesirable. At the moment, before compulsory combination can be effected, it mustbe shown that this would result in a &quot; better supply of water.&quot; It might, however,be difficult to prove that any particular combination of authorities would, in factjsecure this result, and I should like to see the criterion extended to include a reference to a more wholesome, more efficient and more economical supply. Pro-vision would continue to be made for local public inquiries and for the othercustomary safeguards. If this position were secured by legislation, the processof effecting the necessary combinations could be carried out gradually.   I do not38529
think it would be necessary to divide the whole country into &quot; combination &quot; areas.I should confine combinations to those areas where they are clearly necessary inthe interests of purity, economy or efficiency.; 5. I am sure that arrangements on these lines would be more acceptable to scottish local authorities and would meet the Scottish position better than anyof the forms of nationalisation that have so far been discussed. I should hopethat, having regard to the differences in conditions in the two countries, it wouldbe possible to proceed as I propose without causing embarrassment to Englandand Wales.H. McN.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,4th April, 1950.
