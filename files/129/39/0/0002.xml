(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY;&apos; S GOVERNMENT)secret. P. (50) 5228TH MARCH,   1950PROVISION OP ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THENAPIOHaL FILM FI1H.NCE corporation memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Rational Film Finance Corporation was set upabout 18 months ago to arrest the decline in feature film production in this country which had set in owing &quot;to the exhaustion of the industry&apos;s working capital and the difficultyof securing additional finance from private sources.2. The Cinematograph Film Production  (Special Loans)Act gave the Corporation power to borrow up to  5 millions.This sum is nesring exhaustion, end the question of giving further borrowing powers has now to be considered.      In my view the Corporation has thoroughly justified its existence.       It hasmaintained in operation a considerable number of reputable pro-ducers, and in doing so it has been able to exert a realinfluence in the direction of better and more economical pro-duct ion.      With the decline in the -production activities of thevertical combines and particularly of the Rank Organisation,the Corporation&apos;s field has been extending,  and during the last six months or more it has been associated with about 50;S of thefirst feature films currently in production.3, In the discussions on the Bill to establish theCorporation, it was admitted on both sides of the House that  millions represented what was required for an experiment on acomparatively modest scale, and that if the experiment gavepromising results it would be necessary to provide additional funds for its continuance,      while,  in .rny view, the Corporationhas prove a its value,  any proposal to give it a new lease of life would raise the fundamental question whether film produc-tion in this country today represents a reasonable commercialrisk,  even if it is carried on with thorough efficiency and economy.      The British Film Producers&apos; Association claims thatat the present level of entertainments duty it is not,  in fact,such a reasonable risk and that notwithstanding the utmost care and economy in budgeting and in actual production the receiptscannot in general be expected to cover the costs.      This viewhas been supported (though on incomplete evidence) by the  (Plant)Committee on Film Distribution and Exhibition, whose report was published last November (Cmd.  7837).      If this view were correctit would moan that the industry could not go on without a subsidy.h. I am engaged at the present time in collecting fromthe chief organisations concerned with film production cornpre-hensive information regarding the incidence of overhead charges on production costs and the actual earnings of individual filmsover a period of years.      Even with this information, which i hope to receive in the course of next month,  it will probably bedifficult to reach a firm conclusion on the general question ofthe economics of the industry and the steps necessary to put iton a sound basis, whether by additional Government help or by changes in the organisation of the industry.      Should legisla-tion bo required, this would necessarily take time.COPY NO.CABIHET-1 -

5. We are, however, faced with the present risk thatthe Film Finance Corporation may exhaust its funds before the major issue has been settled and that as a result the patientwill expire &quot;before the doctors have completed their diagnosis.To guard against this,  I should like to introduce a one-clauseBill increasing the amount which the Board of Trade may advance to the Corporation from  5 millions to  6 millions.      Thiswould be strictly.an interim measure to preserve the status quountil the Government can reach a decision regarding the general economic position of the film production industry.      I should hope that this proposal would not be controversial.      I under-stand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who undertook to explore the question of additional finance for the national film Finance Corporation when the Production Committee last considered it  (P. 0.(1+9) 23rd Meeting), is prepared to agree,and I hope that my other colleagues will do the same.6. If so authorised, I should propose, to introduce theBill concurrently with the presentation to Parliament of thefirst Annual Report and Accounts from the Film Finance Corpor-ation.      This will probably be about the end of April.7* I am bringing this question to the Cabinet and notto the Production Committee, as I should like to be in aposition, during the course of the debate on the cinematograph films (Quota) Amendment Order on Thursday, 30th March, to announce that legislation will be introduced to extend theCorporation^ borrowing power, and to say that this will afford an opportunity for a debate of a more general character.H. W.Board of Trade, S. W. 1 ,28TH MARCH,  1950.
