A NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee held on 6th June(L.P. (47) 16th Meeting, Minute 3) we had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Labour and National Service (L.P. (47) 92) on the develop-ment of national arbitration machinery. At the end of our discussion theCommittee invited me to circulate to the Cabinet a paper setting out my viewsregarding the case for the establishment of a central arbitral body for the purposeof ensuring that in the settlement of questions of wages and conditions of employ-ment due regard is paid to the prevailing economic conditions.2. Nearly a year ago I put before the Lord Presidents Committeemy ideas on the need for a national wages policy in a memorandum (L.P. (46) 255),a copy of which I attach hereto. My main proposal was the establishment of aNational Wages Authority, consisting of representatives of the Government andof both sides of industry to advise the Government on applications for wagechanges, having particular regard to the inflationary danger, the need to promote a better distribution of our man-power, and the revision of systems of wages to give greater incentive to increased output and efficiency. This paper wasconsidered in a preliminary way by the Lord Presidents Committee at a meetingheld on 1st November, 1946 (L.P. (46) 36th Meeting, Minute 2), but no recom-mendations thereon were then submitted to the Cabinet.3. The same general issues are involved in the paper on the developmentof national arbitration machinery which was considered at the recent meeting ofthe Lord Presidents Committee and which is now being circulated to the Cabinetin a slightly expanded form as CP. (47) 190. Personally I cannot accept theMinister&apos;s conclusion that &quot; The results to date of the working of the existing system have been most satisfactory,&quot; for, although it may be true that theexisting system has succeeded in avoiding some strikes which would otherwise have occurred, it is equally true that that system has failed to secure theestablishment of a proper relationship between the levels of wages and earnings in one industry and. those in another. Nor can I regard as adequate the very limited proposals put forward by the Minister of Labour and National service in his paper, for in essence those proposals would leave wage-fixing as a matternormally for negotiation merely between the employers and the trade unions inparticular industries. In such circumstances, there would be no assurance oreven likelihood that due account would be taken not only of the circumstancesof the particular industry concerned but also of the wider issues affecting the economy of the country clS ct whole.4. The defects of the current method of wage-fixing seem to me to bevery serious, and especially so in the present economic situation and that which lies immediately ahead. A satisfactory system of wage-fixing should, in my view,give the following results : (a) All wages should be at least sufficient to provide the wage-earnerwith a minimum standard of living, covering all the essential needsof life.(b) This minimum should broadly apply to men and women alike; to meetthe greater needs of workers with families to support, the existing system of family allowances should be augmented, by increasing the weekly payments and providing for their further increase if conditionswarrant.[CP. (47) 18920th June, 1947]CABINET
(c) Above this minimum, actual wages in different occupations should notvary one from another erratically on account of factors like the bargaining strength of different negotiating parties. They should bear a consistent relationship, depending on the different degrees ofskill required in different occupations, and especially important inour current man-power situation the comparative reluctance or readiness-ness of workers to engage in particular occupations; we must, in short,be able to use wage relations towards solving the problem of the vitalbut undermanned industries.(d) Wherever piece-work systems prevail, and do in fact provide an effectivestimulus to increased productivity, these methods should be continued.5. It is apparent that these results are not consistently achieved by the prevailing methods of wage-fixing. Wages vary from industry to industry, andeven within a single industry, for reasons quite unrelated to differences of skill andto relative shortages of labour in different occupations. One main cause of varia-tion is the strength-th or weakness of the trade unions concerned. Again, wages ina particular industry are often conventionally related to wages in other industries,so that variations in a particular industry, where they are necessary and appro-priate, may provoke changes in other industries where no change is required inthe general interest, and where, indeed, such changes may negative the benefits ofthe initial wage variation.6. To avoid these defects and to move towards the results listed in para-graph 4 above, I consider that some adjustment must, be made in the machineryfor determining wage-rates. This adjustment could be made without in any wayprejudicing the position of the trade unions, for it would be possible to bring thegeneral interest to bear on the process of wage-fixing by measures which wouldneither weaken, nor reduce the status of, the unions in negotiation.7. The sort of adjustment I have in mind is this. We might establish a central Advisory Council composed of men of broad knowledge and experienceof industrial relations with the duty and authority to investigate and report onclaims for higher wages, taking into account the wider economic and social issues raised. The arrangement would be that any wage claims made by a trade union on behalf of its members would be put in the first place before this Council. (this could be done either direct by the trade union concerned or through the Ministerof Labour and National Service.) The Council would make its report on theclaim, which would then go for negotiation between the two sides of industry inthe normal way. By this method all negotiating parties would be fully appraisedof the economic and social factors involved in changing particular wage rates; soalso would any arbitrator who might later be appointed if the two sides failed toreach agreement.8. The Central Advisory Wages Council might also be asked by theGovernment to comment on the advisability of determining minimum wage ratesgenerally, and its observations could be made known to both sides throughout industry. There may be other issues of general importance in wage-fixing whichcould thus be widely disseminated to those concerned through the medium ofsuch a Central Council without, I would again emphasise, weakening theposition of the trade unions engaged in particular negotiations.9. I realise that proposals on the lines of the above would require legisla-tion, if they were to be effective. Before we discuss statutory provisions, however,I should like to invite my colleagues to discuss, in more general terms, my sug-suggestions for modifying existing wage-fixing practice to take into account the wider economic and social needs of our day.E.

Enclosure to Annex A[L.P. (46) 25522nd October, 1946]cabinet lord President&apos;s CommitteeA PROPOSED NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at our meeting held on 26th July (L.P. (46) 28th Meeting, Conclusion 3) wehad a preliminary discussion on wages policy in the course of which I outlinedcertain broad considerations by which, in my view, the Government should guidethemselves in their approach to this problem. At the conclusion of our discussionI was invited by the Committee to circulate a memorandum setting out in greater detail the suggestions I had put forward. This I have now done in the present paper.The Two-fold Nature of the problem. I think it became clear in the course of our discussion that we wereup against a two-fold problem in regard to wages : (i) the danger that in the present situation not merely of full employment,but of general labour shortage, wage increases might proceed at sucha rate as to impair our price stabilisation policy;(ii) the difficulty of securing wage differentials in favour of high priorityundermanned industries owing to the tendency of wages in the less important industries to increase at the same rate or even faster.(i) The danger of an inflationary spiral3. We all know that stability of prices is an essential condition for thesuccess of our whole economic policy. It is essential to safeguard the real valueof the people&apos;s earnings and of social security benefits; it is essential for the orderly progress of our domestic economic planning; and, finally, it is essentialto preserve our competitive position in relation to the outside world and to secureand maintain a balance of our international accounts.4. During and since the war, price stability has been achieved in so faras it was achieved mainly by means of subsidies. In the circumstances thiswas to be preferred to a policy of allowing the prices of essential goods to riseto the full extent of the increases in costs. But in the long run such a methodof preventing inflation has serious disadvantages. If wages, other costs and profits were allowed to rise unchecked, the subsidies needed to hold the cost ofliving would become increasingly burdensome, and the taxation necessary to finance them and prevent inflation would operate as a disincentive to effort and enterprise (as well as largely counterbalancing for the wage-earners the benefits of the initial wage increases). We must therefore aim at stabilising the cost ofliving by preventing general price increases from occurring rather than bycompensating for them by means of subsidies after they have occurred.5. In so far as the inflationary potential is due mainly to shortage of goodscombined with excess purchasing power in the hands of consumers, it may be effectively checked by measures of price control and rationing. But thistechnique cannot suffice to hold back an inflation due to continually increasingwages. In addition to measures of price control, therefore, some control of generalwage increases is required if an inflationary spiral is to be avoided.
(ii) Wage differentials in favour of undermanned priority industries6. With the disappearance of direct labour controls, economic incentivesbecome the main instrument for guiding labour into one industry or another.As an essential prerequisite for our general economic planning, we must have some means of guiding our man- and woman-power into these occupations where their services are most urgently needed, and for this purpose we must exercisesome control over the relative attractiveness of wages and conditions in different industries.7. I realise that, particularly with the current shortages of goods in the shops, money wage rates are not the only, and perhaps not even the most important,economic incentive. In present circumstances, hours of work, holidays, housing,working conditions and amenities may play an even greater role in attractingpersons to different industries or in keeping them there once they have arrived.Nevertheless, money earnings will become of increasing importance as consumers&apos;goods become more plentiful and the scope for spending those earnings increases.An obvious first step in trying to get the additional labour we so urgentlyneed in the mines, foundries, and in agriculture, has been to encourage an increasein wage rates in these industries relatively to those in industries of lower priority.But efforts in this direction up to date have been largely frustrated by the factthat any increase in wages granted in one of these essential industries has beenimmediately followed by a host of demands for wage increases in other, less essential, industries.Defects of the Traditional Collective Bargaining System8. In respect of both the problems discussed above, the traditional systemof collective wage-bargaining conducted industry by industry has serious short-comings under present-day economic conditions. A situation of general labour shortage naturally offers favourable opportunities for wage increases throughoutthe system. But in conditions of full employment, general increases in wage-ratesmay easily fail to secure any increase in the real income of wage-earners as awhole, since they will generally lead to price increases of at least similar dimen-sions. Moreover, in addition to failing in their objective of raising the standardof living of wage-earners as a whole, such general wage increases may, as Ihave already indicated, undermine the price stabilisation policy which lies atthe basis of our whole economic planning. So long as wage-fixing is undertakenindependently industry by industry (whether by collective bargaining, conciliationboards or any other method) there can be no guarantee that wages in general willnot rise faster than is compatible with the requirements of a stable price level.9. Similarly, in so far as it is relative wages that influence the flow oflabour into one industry or another, the desired relative wage structure cannot possibly be arrived at by any method of fixing wages in one industry alone.Wages in all industries must be considered at the same time if differentials areto be secured in favour of those to which it is most necessary to attract newrecruits.The Need for a National Wages Authority10. All these considerations point to the need for some central authority which will supervise wage changes with a view to ensuring both that they arenot incompatible with the Governments price stabilisation policy and that theywill promote and not impede the distribution of man-power in the desireddirection.11. It is not enough, in my view, to set up machinery merely for discussing the problems, as envisaged in the recently established National industrial conference. This will no doubt fulfil a valuable educative function, but inaddition to this there is a judicial or executive job to be done.12. It is clear that although wage-earners as a whole cannot gain byexcessive pushing up of money wage rates, when this leads to an equal or even greater increase in prices, this is not true of each individual wage-group. In ageneral scramble for wage increases carrying price increases in their wake, thereis always a chance that the more powerful and better organised unions may securewage increases in the industries for which they are responsible more rapidly
and on a greater scale than those secured by the weaker or less well-organisedworkers. Even though the real income accruing to wage-earners as a whole maynot increase, the better organised workers may in this way be able to increase their share of it at the expense of their less fortunate fellows. Moreover, forevery union that is actually in a position to improve the relative situation of its members in such a free-for-all wage scramble, there would be a number of others who would think they could do so although, in fact, they might well lose. It is because of the genuine conflict of interest involved, that some judicial or executive authority is necessary to ensure a national wages policy consistent with therequirements of general economic planning. It is true that the acceptance ofsuch an authority in place of the traditional system of unrestricted individualcollective bargaining will call for a considerable effort of self-restraint and sense of working class solidarity, particularly on the part of the larger and more powerful unions. Yet this measure of self-restraint is absolutely essential if weare to secure any stability in our economic system in conditions of full employ-ment, and in particular if we are to influence the flow of man-power into theindustries and trades where it is most urgently needed.Constitution of the National Wages Authority13. Since the primary function of the National Wages Authority would beto &apos;&apos; divide up the cake &apos;&apos; between groups of wage-earners in different industries,it is essential that the various interested parties should be fairly represented.Wide trade union representation should thus constitute the first element.Employers should also be included, though, in so far as there is an efficientlyfunctioning price control, they will probably be less interested in the sharing ofthe spoils. They will, however, be interested in the effects of changes in therelative wage structure on labour supply, and possibly also on the export trade.Finally, since the whole purpose of the National Wages Authority would be toensure that wage changes should be in conformity with the requirements of theGovernment&apos;s general economic policy, Government representation, or at least aGovernment chairman, would be essential.14. The representatives of wage-earners and employers might be nominated by the T.U.C. and Employers&apos; Federation respectively, the nominations to be approved by the Government. The Government would presumably be repre-sented by officials from the Ministry of Labour on labour-supply questions, andfrom the Treasury or Cabinet Offices on matters of general economic policy.Functions of the National Wages Authority15. I do not believe that so important a function as actually determiningwages should be delegated to a statutory body of the kind described. The finalresponsibility for decisions regarding national wage policy should lie with theGovernment; the function of the National Wages Authority should be confined to that of making recommendations to the Government regarding wage changes.16. The National Wages Authority could operate either passively, in response to applications for wage changes in different industries, or actively, by itself initiating proposals for such changes. It would tend to operate rather inthe first manner in conditions such as those prevailing at the present time, when,owing to the general labour shortage, there is an inflationary upward pressure on wages which needs to be held in check in the interests of price stability. In a timeof slack trade and unemployment, on the other hand, the National Wages Autho-rity might itself try to promote wage increase, particularly in the worst paidindustries. The National Wages Authority would also operate as a check on anytendency to wage-cutting which might develop in such conditions. Applications tothe National Wages Authority for wage changes might be received from tradeunions, from employers or from Government Departments.Principles of Operation17.   As I have already stated, the two main functions of the National WagesAuthority would be (a) to ensure that changes made in wages are not incompatible with generalprice stability;
(b) to develop a structure of relative wages which would help to promote aflow of labour in the directions desired and to prevent a flow in the opposite direction.18. Generally speaking, it must be expected that wage increases will be passed on to consumers in the form of price increases. How far this process can take place without causing a general price inflation will depend on the extent towhich other factors such as increases in productivity and the squeezing of profit margins by means of efficient price control are at the same time effective in depressing prices. The National Wages Authority would, therefore, need tokeep itself fully informed of developments in these other fields which affect prices.In particular, it would require to study changes in the general level of produc-tivity and changes in profit margins.19. The first task, that of keeping wages in step,with the requirements of price stability, consists therefore in limiting the extent of wage increases ingeneral, so that, in their effect on prices, they will do no more than counter-balance the fall in other costs due to improvements in productive efficiency,together with reductions in profit margins resulting from price control and anyother measures directed against restrictive practices. This does not mean, ofcourse, that wage policy. or price policy, for that matter need be directed to preventing any individual price increases from occurring. To safeguard the valueof money, it is necessary only that some fair representative index of average price is kept stable. The scope of wage increases in any particular industry is notnecessarily dependent, therefore, on increased efficiency or a reduction in profit margins in that particular industry, but could equally be rendered possible(consistently with general price stability) by improved efficiency or reduced profit margins in quite another industry.20. The second task of the National Wages Authority would be, consistently with the requirements of price stability discussed above, to determine in whichindustries wages should be permitted to increase and in which industries, on theother hand, demands for wage increases should be resisted. Two main principles should be applied in making such decisions. The first would be that of promoting a desirable redistribution of the nation&apos;s labour force, and the second, the ehmina-tion of unduly low wages and &quot; sweating &quot; in badly organised industries.21. In the application of the first principle, those industries and occupa-tions which were (a) of high priority, and (b) suffering from particularly seriouslabour shortage (as measured by the number of unfilled vacancies) would receive more favourable treatment in respect of demands for wage increases than less essential industries or those in which the labour shortage was less acute.22. The second principle, that of eliminating &quot; sweating &quot; and unduly low wages, would be particularly important in times of slack trade and unemploy-ment, when the workers in those industries would be especially vulnerable owingto the absence of alternative employment. The main object, at all times, wouldbe to ensure that no one was receiving wages for a full week&apos;s work which were insufficient to provide a reasonable minimum standard of living. The minimum wage for men should be based on the cost of providing a reasonable standardof living for a man plus the average number of dependants say, a wife and two children, taking into account the 5s. a week family allowance (subject to incometax) now provided in respect of the second child. The minimum for women wouldhave to be lower, on account of the smaller number of dependants, who, on theaverage, have to be supported by each female wage-earner. Tor juveniles the mini-mum would be lower still, since they are not normally self-supporting, but live athome. Some fixed proportion of the adult minimum for the same sex wouldbe appropriate, rising by stages, say at 16 to 18 years, until it reached 100 percent, of the adult minimum at the age of 21.23. In considering wage changes in particular industries, the national wages Authority should devote particular attention to the incentive effect of the wage structure. Wherever possible the structure should be such as to offer ahigh incentive to effort&apos;and efficiency. This can in many cases be achieved bymeans of piece-rate systems of payment, or by means of a high production bonussuperimposed on a basic rate related to a given production target. From thepoint of view of recruitment, it is mainly the weekly earnings that count. Fromthe incentive viewpoint, it will be better in general that any increases in rates
should take the form of an increase in piece-rates or in the production bonusrather than in the basic rate. Questions of grading and differentials for skillwould also have to be taken into account, and the National Wages authority would require a trained staff of economists, statisticians and industrial psycho-logists to investigate and advise on the effects of different systems of wagepayment.The Role of Price Control24. As I indicated in paragraph 5 above, wage policy is only one element in our general price stabilisation policy; to be fully effective, it must be accom-panied by measures of direct price control (and, in certain cases, of rationing).Similarly, in regard to our second objective, that of influencing the distributionof labour between different industries, wage policy will be unlikely to be effectiveunless accompanied by a price control policy directed toward the same ends.For, although it may be perfectly feasible to establish minimum wages by law,it is far more difficult, and probably impracticable to establish maximum wages in the same way. If this is true, we might easily find that even if we were to succeed in pushing up minimum rates in priority industries above those in less essential industries, the actual rates in the latter might rise still higher. Thisis where the need for direct price controls comes in. If the prices of less essential goods and services were strictly controlled, the temptation to entice labour intothem by the offer of wages in excess of those ruling in the essential industries would be strictly limited. In these circumstances wage increases, though theymight serve to secure some additional labour and thus make possible an expansionof output, would inevitably reduce the profit margin on each unit of output sold.Beyond a certain point the latter effect would outweigh the former and theinducement to further wage increases would disappear.25. At the present time the Board of Trade are inevitably hampered intheir efforts at direct price control by the absence of an effective wage policy.The argument that wages have in fact gone up has almost inevitably to be accepted as a justification for raising&quot; the controlled price. But once a distinction is drawn between permitted wage increases, based on a published recommendation of theNational Wages Authority, and other unauthorised wage increases, the pricecontrolling authority would be in a far stronger position. In the case of wage increases of the latter kind, they could adopt a firm line in resisting price increases, and might thereby succeed in preventing the unauthorised wage increases from occurring. This would be of advantage both from the point ofview of price stability as well as that of establishing wage differentials in favourof priority industries.26. In view of the close and vital relation between wage policy and price control, I feel it is most important to consider what means are available to tighten up and extend the existing price controlling machinery. This is a matter on which it would be valuable to obtain the views of the Board of Trade, both inthe light of their past experience and also in view of the possible effects on theirprice control machinery of the adoption of a national wage policy of the kindadvocated in this paper. In particular, I would like them to consider how thecontrol of prices of the less essential goods and services could be tightened up.I realise that, in view of quality variations and the large number of smallenterprises concerned, effective price control in this sector is extremely difficult;nevertheless, as I have tried to show, it is particularly important, not only fromthe point of view of price stability, but even more from the point of view of thedistribution of labour between different industries.The Problem of General Labour Shortage27. While we may be able to secure some improvement in the labour supply to the high priority undermanned industries by means of the proposed national wages policy, combined with the provision of other kinds of incentive, it is nouse deceiving ourselves that the task will be an easy one or that a spectacularredistribution of labour is likely to follow such a policy. The truth is that weare up against labour shortages all round. All industries appear to be under-manned, and the logically corresponding &apos;&apos; overmanned industries &apos;&apos; are nowhereto be seen.
28. Apart from the wage policy discussed in the earlier part of this paper,there are two general approaches to this problem of overall labour shortage. Thefirst is to seek to increase the effective labour supply as a whole, which would offer sources of additional labour for the undermanned industries without thenecessity of raiding the hypothetical &quot; overmanned industries.&quot; I indicate briefly-some possible lines of attack in this direction in paragraph 31 below, but the totalscope of such measures is obviously limited, particularly in the short run.29. For our immediate purposes, I feel that we must inevitably have recourse to the second of the two general approaches referred to above. We mustconsciously select the industries which, from the point of view of government policy, we wish to regard as &apos;&apos; overmanned,&apos;&apos; and take deliberate steps to reducethe scope of these industries, thus forcibly releasing labour from them for thegenuinely undermanned industries. The &apos;&quot; overmanned industries &apos;&apos; in this senseare not industries in which there is no demand for, or even a surplus of, labour from the point of view of the employers concerned, under present market conditions. On the contrary the employers concerned no doubt regard these industries to-day as grossly undermanned. They are, however, overmanned inthe sense that if the existing resources of the country were to be distributedaccording to the scale of urgency of their different products in the light of our general economic policy, these particular industries would be smaller than theyare to-day, and other basic industries (such as coalmining, agriculture and ironfoundries) would be larger.30. I feel convinced that the only really effective contribution to the problemof the undermanned industries in the short run would be to undertake a thoroughweeding out of labour from the less essential industries and occupations. Inthe absence of powers of direct labour control, the only way to achieve thiswould be by a ruthless cutting down of the scope of these industries. this could be effected by the use of the raw material allocation system, building-licences, investment control, and, in certain extreme cases, even by means of totalprohibitions.31. Apart from such methods of releasing labour from less essential occupa-tions, we should, as I have suggested above, neglect no opportunity of increasing-our total labour force. In the first place we should increase, as far as possible,the proportion of our population engaged in productive employment (by offering-incentive to the married women who were employed during the war to returnto industry, inducing older workers to postpone retirement, &amp;e). At the sametime, we should do all we can to make more effective use of the man-poweralready at our disposal. There is plenty of scope for improvements in the efficiency of our industries, and we should press on with all the means at our disposal for promoting such improvements. The extension of mass production of standardisedarticles through the utility goods scheme; rigorous priep control directed towardsthe elimination of the inefficient, and therefore high cost, producers; compara-tive studies of production techniques adopted in different countries; reorganisation and nationalisation of inefficient industries. Only by a vigorous pursuit ofall such methods of increasing productive efficiency shall we be able to providefor our people the standard of living to which they are entitled, and which,after all, it should be the primary aim of the economic policy of a SocialistGovernment to establish.Summary of Principal Conclusions and RecommendationsMy principal conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as-follows : (1) Both from the point of view of avoiding inflation and from that ofsecuring a rational distribution of man-power, the existing system of wage fixing by means of independent collective bargaining, industry by industry, has serious defects (paragraphs 1-9).(2) A National Wages Authority should, therefore, be set up to advise theGovernment on all wage changes (paragraphs 10-12).(3) The Authority should consist of representatives of trade unions,employers and the Government (paragraphs 13-14).
(4) It should be responsible for ensuring (a) that wage changes should not be incompatible with the require-ments of price stabilisation policy;(&amp;) that the wages structure should be such as to promote a distri-bution of labour in accordance with the Governments economic policy;(c) that in no industry should wages for a full week&apos;s work be belowa level required to provide a reasonable standard of living;(d) that systems of wage payment should be designed, as far aspossible, to provide the maximum incentive to productiveefficiency (paragraphs 15-23).(5) The national wages policy must be accompanied by an effective price control policy directed towards reducing profit margins, as well aspromoting price stability and a rational distribution of resources(paragraphs 24-25).(6) An examination by the Board of Trade of possible methods of tighteningand extending the existing price control machinery particularly inthe less essential industries, would be of great value (paragraph 26).(7) Deliberate steps should be taken, by means of raw material controls,building licences, &amp;c, to reduce the scope of: employment in less essential industries and occupations with a view to releasing labour for the undermanned priority industries (paragraph 30).^8) Further efforts should be made to increase the proportion of the popula-tion engaged in productive employment, particularly by persuadingwomen to remain in industry and older workers to postpone retirement(paragraph 31).*(9) Measures to increase the efficiency of British industry should be accelerated, e.g., standardisation combined with large-scale produc-tion, comparative international studies of production techniques,elimination of restrictive practices, reorganisation and nationalisa-tion of industry in general (paragraph 31).E.

ANNEX B[CP. (47) 1903rd July, 1947]CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL ARBITRATION MACHINERYMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in accordance with the desire of the Lord Presidents Committee on 2nd May,1947 (L.P. (47) 13th Meeting, Minute 1), I have given careful consideration tothe question whether the existing machinery for arbitration might be consolidatedin a Central Arbitral Body, which would be under a duty to make itself acquainted with the facts of the economic position and which would be empowered to obtain from the Government any further economic facts about a particular industry should they be relevant to the case with which it is concerned. The followingmemorandum is submitted at the request of the Lord Presidents Committeegiving the results of my examination of this matter :-Existing Machinery2. The existing arbitration machinery may be said to fall into three classes : (i) Voluntary machinery set up by agreement between the two sides of an industry;(ii) Voluntary machinery under the Conciliation Act, 1896, and industrial courts Act, 1919, which includes (a) the Industrial Court set up underthe Industrial Courts Act, (b) Boards of Arbitration consisting ofthree or more persons, and (c) Single Arbitrators; and(iii) Compulsory machinery set up by the Conditions of Employment and national Arbitration Orders, 1940-45.3. In the case of voluntary arbitration machinery set up by agreement withthe two sides of an industry, the Minister may or may not be consulted as tothe form of machinery or the person or persons to be appointed with the powersof arbitrator. Notes on the arrangements in various industries are containedin Appendix I. It wiil be seen that they include provisions in the constitutionof Joint Industrial Councils for the reference of disputes to the Industrial Court,or the National Arbitration Tribunal, for arbitration by an independent chair-man, or by a Committee of the Council with the powers of an umpire, for&quot;arbitration&quot; without specifying the form, or for conciliation either withinthe Council or by the appointment of outside conciliators. There are many otherJoint Industrial Councils which make no direct provision, but which in practicerefer disputes to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act, either to theIndustrial Court itself, or to a Board of Arbitration or Single Arbitrator.Examples of large and important industries with comprehensive agreed arrange-ments for arbitration of disputes are also given in Appendix I, together witha note on the systems evolved for the Civil Service, both industrial and non1industrial, for the railways, and for Civil Air Transport (as an example of a nationalised industry).Any attempt to impose a central arbitral body on indtistry would involvea far-reaching revision of voluntary arrangements which many industries would refuse to undertake.4. The Industrial Court is a central standing body which is always availableto industry. In the case of ad hoc appointments, the Minister makes the appoint-ments and is entitled to defray the expenses of the arbitrator. If one side orthe other is not agreeable to arbitration there is no authority in the minister under these Acts to compel arbitration. The two parties are thrown back ontheir own resources and are free to reach such agreement as is mutually acceptable.A description of the relevant provisions is contained in Ajopendix II.
The experience of the last 30 years has shown that the flexibility of thepresent arrangements has great advantages and that there is much merit in theexistence of these alternative forms of voluntary arbitration. It has frequentlyhappened that the parties to a dispute have refused to have recourse to oneof them, but have agreed to make use of one of the others, with the result thatdisputes and stoppages of work have been avoided.5. In the case of compulsory arbitration, it must be appreciated that thisis a purely temporary provision introduced during the war on the recommenda-tion of the two sides of industry with a view to avoiding strikes and lock-outs.It has been continued since the war on the recommendation of the Joint Con-consultative Committee, but on the clear understanding that the Conditions ofEmployment and National Arbitration Orders will be revoked whenever either side so desire. There is no intention under present circumstances of retainingthis form of machinery as a permanent feature of our industrial legislation.Under this Order either side is entitled to report a dispute to the Ministerand the Minister in certain circumstances is bound to refer it to the national arbitration Tribunal for decision, but the Minister has no power to compel any party to report a dispute to him, and without a report he cannot refer the matter to arbitration. When a case is referred, any award is binding and becomes animplied term of contract between the employer and the worker. Strikes andlock-outs are made illegal under the Order unless the Minister has failed to refer the matter to the National Arbitration Tribunal within a specified period, or tothe appropriate machinery where such machinery has not yet been exhausted.Penalties are provided for breach of the Order, but experience during the war has shown that they are quite ineffective if required to deal with any largenumbers of men.6. In addition to the above classes of arbitration machinery there is theform of compulsory arbitration-cum-conciliation, which is obtained by means of adding independent members to Wages Councils and other statutory wageregulating Boards, but it is necessary to bear in mind that these independent members only begin to function either as conciliators or as arbitrators if thereis a difference on which the two sides cannot agree a settlement.7. Any proposal to impose a central arbitral body on industry would bevalueless without the full co-operation of both sides. A tribunal must be seen and known to be completely independent, and if the parties were to suspect thatoutside influence was being exerted on the Arbitration Tribunal there would be a refusal to go to arbitration which would simply put the Tribunal out of business.The lack of acceptable arbitration machinery might then throw the workers backon to strike action to redress their grievances. The high regard in which theexisting machinery is held is due, firstly, to its independent status and freedom from Government control, and, secondly, to its flexibility which enables everyindustry to obtain that form of arbitration best suited to its needs and circumstances.8. My inquiries lead me definitely to the conclusion that the co-operationof industry would not be forthcoming for the proposal that has been made. Theprinciple of compulsory arbitration as embodied in the Conditions of Employ-ment and National Arbitration Order is accepted only for a limited purpose.It is most useful under present circumstances, but if anything were done whichmight prejudice its independence in the eyes of industry this would cause one side or the other to ask for the revocation of the Order.9. I am satisfied that, although the employers to-day might welcome a leadfrom the Government which would assist them in resisting wage application,they would not be prepared to accept such aid if it involved Government inter-vention in arbitration machinery, even if only to present the economic positionto the country. As one employer put it, economic facts are really economic views which may be expressed one way on one occasion but might be expressed in another way on another occasion. The danger is that confidence in arbitrationmachinery might be destroyed and with it the most effective means of disposing of disputes when the differences cannot be resolved by negotiation.10. The policy I am pursuing is directed to ensure that arbitrators shallbe drawn from a select body of men who will have a knowledge of a number ofindustries and can be depended upon to have a broad and statesmanlike ^outlook.
Moreover, by employing the same individuals as Chairmen of a number of wages councils or Wages Boards or as independent members of such Councils andBoards, we are going a long way to ensure that the awards to different classes ofworkers are kept reasonably well in step. This is the policy I have been pursuingin my appointments and I have every hope that it can be built up on the basisof confidence of both sides. The President of the Industrial Court is also theChairman of the Railway Staff National Tribunal, of the Retail Pharmacy joint industrial Council, of the South Wales Conciliation Board for the coal mining industry, and of one of the Iron and Steel Industry Wages Board; he is on the panel of independent Chairmen for the Co-operative National Conciliation Board,and has held a number of ad hoc appointments as Chairman of Courts of Inquiry.The Chairman of the National Arbitration Tribunal, in addition to filling anumber of ad hoc appointments on Courts of Inquiry, &amp;c, is also Chairman ofthe Licensed Non-Residential Establishments Wages Board, of the LicensedResidential Establishment and Licensed Restaurant Wages Board, of the VarietyEntertainments Council (which deals with conditions of employment) and of theLondon Passenger Transport Board Negotiating Committee. During the past three months I have made or approved twenty-five appointments of independent members of Wages Boards and Councils, but the number of individuals who havebeen appointed is only eleven. So far as the appointment of single arbitratorsis concerned, I have made use of five individuals during the last five months forsixteen arbitrations.11. There are plenty of public-spirited men of established position and prestige who are willing to serve in the above capacities, but they would not beprepared to serve in any capacity which restricted their independence. It isknown that in fact they pay great attention to the Economic Survey for 1947 and government statements about the economic position. They are conversant withthe economic position of the various industries and their relationship to eachother and are fully alive to the repercussions of any awards they may make.12. By following the policy described in the preceding paragraphs, I am satisfied that, in so far as arbitration machinery is concerned, we are doing allthat can be done to achieve in most cases the two important objectives : (1) Of ensuring that in wages awards due regard is paid not only to theposition in the particular industry concerned but to the general economic position of the country.(2) Of ensuring that a proper relativity is maintained between the awardsmade to different classes of workers.13. It is doubtful how far the above considerations apply in the case ofcertain forms of machinery whose recommendations regarding remuneration,being unrelated to the awards of other bodies, are already causing a certainconcern and may, unless carefully steered, give rise to considerable embarrass-ment. Examples of such bodies are the Burnham Committee on teachers&apos;remuneration and the Rushcliffe Committee on nurses&apos; remuneration. In eachcase the Chairman, although an experienced public personality, has no otherappointment in connection with the settlement of the remuneration of largebodies of employees. In each case the Committee contains no independent members. It might be possible in due course, when vacancies occur, to appointas Chairman of each of these bodies a person who already is Chairman of oneor more other Wages Tribunals or is accustomed to acting as an arbitrator inmatters of remuneration. / suggest that consideration should be given to themaking of appointments to these Committees which woidd apply to them theprinciples I am following in my appointments.14. In the case of Local Authorities, there are no arrangements for arbitra-tion in the constitution of the various Joint Industrial Councils. These councils are empowered only to make recommendation to their constituents. The individual authorities being democratically elected are unwilling to concede to anybodythe right to determine the wages and conditions of their employees.15. Apart from the damage that might be done to the machinery of arbitra-tion by injudicious action on the part of government, there is the furtherconsideration that the antecedent provisions for negotiation and conciliation mayhe likewise affected detrimentally, and this at a time when the principle of voluntary machinery has received a new impulse by the inclusion in the various
Socialisation Bills of clauses requiring the new socialised Boards to consult withthe trade unions for the establishment of adequate machinery on a voluntary basis. The principle of voluntary negotiation and arbitration has been completelyaccepted for socialised industries (as indeed it has been in the Post Office formany years). The process of nationalising some of our most important industriestherefore has brought with it no departure from the general principles of collec-tive bargaining as applied in privately-owned industry.16. There is another problem which in my view is most important, namely,to create conditions which will avoid the formulation of wage applications by pressure from the rank and file. This can only be done by educating the workersthemselves and if was with this in mind that the recent White Papers were issued.The National Joint Advisory Council is pledged to support the Government inthe endeavour to make known generally the full economic facts and I shall bein the very near future putting forward to the Lord Presidents Committee a comprehensive scheme for the active encouragement of the formation of joint production Committees which I feel might provide the necessary medium forconveying the information which it is desired to transmit. As my colleagues willbe aware, the National Joint Advisory Council has recently come to an agreement on the establishment of Joint Production Committees.17. When considering the problem of wages it is necessary continually tokeep it in its proper perspective. We are only two years away from the endof the war. Times are still difficult but we have every reason to congratulateourselves on the remarkable success that has so far attended the handling ofindustrial relations in this country. Although my colleagues will be fully aware of the great difference in the two years since VJ-day as compared with the years1919-20 it might be as well if I restated the facts. In 1919-20 the working hoursof 7 million workers were reduced by an average of six hours a week. Thecorresponding figure since VJ-day is 4f million workers, with an average reduc-tion of three hours per week. At the end of 1920, wage rates had risen 175 percent, as compared with the pre-war figure. To-day, wage rates are 66 per cent,above the pre-war figure. In this connexion I would like to point out that itwas always seen that wage rates would continue to rise until the end of post-warsettlements which occurred in July 1946. Since July 1946 ivage rates have remained virtually stable. I realise of course that the satisfactory measure ofwages stability which we have been able to achieve so far has been made possible by means of extensive subsidies.&quot; It may also be that the percentage increase in real wages following VJ-day is higher than the increase in wage rates suggests.The existing Cost of Living Index is however completely discredited and the newInterim Index of Retail Prices gives no basis for comparison for the purposeof estimating the increase in real wages.18. This position has been reached with the minimum of disturbance. In1919-20 the number of working days lost owing to trade disputes amounted to61^ million. Since VJ-day the corresponding figure is about 5 million, and itis significant to, note that in the three calendar years 1944, 1945 and 1948 thecorresponding figures were respectively as follows : The trend shown by these figures is, I suggest, most encouraging, and I feelthat we are fully justified in avoiding any drastic change that involves a riskof disturbing or disrupting the established machinery.19. In considering the future, however, it would be a mistake to ignore the growing feeling that rising prices are affecting the cost of living to the detriment of the worker, but I have every hope that the new interim index of retail prices which was introduced on 17th June will supply the necessarystabilising influence. This new index is on a much broader base. It will notbe subject to the same pressure in respect of food prices, and should commandgreater confidence as being a considerable improvement on the existing index.It may very well be that the movement of prices will be such that some upward movement of the new index will be inevitable. If this results in a small controlledincrease of wrages, that might, in fact, be a most useful safety-valve.1944194519463,710,0002,840,0002,160,000
Enclosure I to Annex BProvisions in Constitutions or Agreements of Joint Industrial Councilsfor the Final Settlement of DisputesI. By Arbitration (a) The following Councils have made provision for reference to theNational Arbitration Tribunal, or to the Industrial Court if the terms ofreference are not appropriate for consideration by the National arbitration tribunal: National Joint Council for County Council Roadmen.National Joint Council for Staff of Hospitals and Allied Institutions(England and Wales).(1) I have very carefully considered the proposal to focus arbitrationauthority in a central body, but I have come to the conclusion thatthe risk to the established machinery involved in anything that mightimpair general confidence in its independence is too great to be taken.We cannot afford it.(2) As an alternative to the proposal in (1) we should continue the policyof(a) Drawing arbitrators from a select body of men who will have aknowledge of a number of industries and can be depended uponto have a broad and statesmanlike outlook.(&amp;) Employing the same individual as Chairman of a number ofWages Council or Wages Boards, and adopting the same policyin regard to the independent members of such Councils andBoards. This, I am satisfied, is the best way of achieving thetwo important objectives of (i) ensuring that in making awards proper regard is paidto the general economic position of the country;(ii) a reasonable relativity is maintained between the awards made to different classes of workers.Consideration should be given to the possibility of making appointments to bodies like the Burnham Committee on teachers&apos; remuneration and the Rushcliffe Committee on nurses&apos; remuneration, which wouldhave the effect of applying the same principles to those Committees.With a view to bringing home to the workers and the public as a whole the dangers of unrestrained claims for improved remuneration weshould take steps to make the facts of our economic position more widely known, and for this purpose we should (a) press on, in association with the two sides of industry, with theestablishment of Joint Production Committees or their equivalent;(&amp;) take full advantage of the co-operation of the National joint advisory Council in disseminating information relating to our economic position.(5) The results to date of the working of the existing system have been most satisfactory. There seems to be danger of an upward trend in pricesthat may affect wages, but the change-over to the new interim index of retail prices should prove a stabilising influence.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1947.

There are, in addition to the foregoing, 64 Councils who make no direct provision for arbitration or conciliation by persons outside the Council.In a number of cases, however, provision is made for the reference of disputesto the Council or to a Committee of the Council. In some cases, includingGovernment Industrial Councils, disputes are, in practice, referred to theIndustrial Court, though specific provision for this has not been made in theConstitutions or Agreements.tgj -JOINT NEGOTIATING MACHINERYRailwaysTraffic Staff (including Supervisory and Clerical Staffs)&apos;&apos; Machinery of negotiation for railway staff&apos;&apos; established by an agreementbetween the Railway Companies and the Unions, provides as follows: Local Departmental Committees consider such questions as arrangements of transfers of personnel, working hours, meal intervals, holiday arrangements, staffaccommodation, &amp;c.Sectional Councils consider the local application of national agreementsrelating to standard salaries, wages and other standard conditions.Railway Staff National Council, representing the Companies and the Unions,decides questions, other than minor issues, as to standard salaries, wages, hoursof duty and other standard conditions of service.Railway Staff&apos; National Tribunal is composed of only three members, onerepresenting the Companies, one representing the Unions and one, the Chairman,appointed by agreement between the Companies and the Unions or, failing such agreement, by the Minister of Labour and National Service after consultationwith the Companies and the Unions. The Tribunal decides issues of major importance not settled by the Railway Staff National Council.Railway Workshop Supervisory StaffRailway Workshop Supervisory Staff National Council, consisting of theEmployers&apos; Side of the Railways Staff Conference and (on the Workers&apos; Side)of the N.U.R., R.C.A., Association of Supervisory Staffs and EngineeringTechnicians, the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions andthe Amalgamated Engineering Union, deals with rates of pay and conditions ofservice. There is no special provision for arbitration, but in the event of disagreement recourse would no doubt be had to voluntary arbitration.* In this case the agreements were made between the Employers&quot; and Workers&apos; Organisationsnot meeting as a Joint Industrial Council.
Railway Shopmen&apos;s National Council, consisting, on the Employers&apos; Side,of the Railway Staff Conference, and, on the Workers&apos; Side, of the N.U.R.,A.E.U., N.U.F.W., Confederation, of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, andAmalgamated Machine Engine and Iron Grinders&apos; and Glaziers&apos; Society, settlesall national questions relating to rates of pay, hours of duty and general conditions of employment. In the event of disagreement recourse has, for manyyears, been had to the Industrial Court for arbitration.The agreement governing the procedure for railway shopmen also providesfor the consideration of any question (not settled locally with an employee or group of employees) at the various levels by :(1) A Shop Committee; .(2) Works Committee; .,-(3) Departmental Line Committee. . .Electricity Generating Station StaffArrangements for negotiating machinery in this section are similar to those for railway shopmen. ,Railway police the Railways Act, 1921, required special arrangements to be made for settling pay and conditions of service of railway police. The scheme agreed between the Companies and Police representatives provides for the following arrangements: Railway Police Central Conference, comprising representatives of theCompanies and Railway Police Federation, deals with wages and conditionsof service. &apos;Line Conferences, separately composed to deal with matters affectingrespectively Inspectors, Sergeants, and Detectives and Constables, thoughany two of the separate Conferences may, by agreement between the partiessit together as one Conference.Central Conference deals with general matters affecting Police Forcesof all railways and with disputes referred to it by Line Conferences.London Passenger Transport Underground RailwaysPart VI of the London Passenger Transport Act provides that rates of pay and other conditions of service should be dealt with by a Negotiating Com-mittee and, on appeal, by arbitration by a Wages Board, the latter consistingof six representatives of the London Passenger Transport Board, six representa-tives of the Unions, four representatives of certain organisations representingusers of the railways, and an Independent Chairman. So far it has not beenfound necessary to set up such a Wages Board.The Act also provides for the establishment of one or more Councilsconsisting of officers of the London Passenger Transport Board and representa-tives of their employees. There are separate Joint Councils for the various classes of employees of the Board, e.g. (1) traffic grades, (2) certain specialiststaff and (3) workshop supervisory engineering staff.The Civil Service(a,) Non-Industrial Grades(1) Shortly after the publication of the Whitley Report, a National whitley council was set up to deal with conditions of employment of a general natureaffecting the whole service, and Departmental Councils were appointed to dealwith matters of departmental concern only. Briefly, the objects of the Councilswere : &quot; To secure the greatest measure of co-operation between theAdministration in its capacity as an employer and the general body of theStaff in matters affecting the Department with a view to increased efficiency in the Department combined with the well-being of those employed; to providemachinery for dealing with grievances, and generally to bring together theexperience and different points of view respecting conditions of service withinthe Department.&quot;
(2) The National Council membership is made up in equal numbers of anOfficial Side in the main Civil Servants of high rank and a Staff Side ofthe representatives of the Staff Associations. Joint agreements between the two sides have first to be reported to the Cabinet, whereupon they become operative.The membership of the Departmental Councils is modelled on that of the NationalCouncils, agreements becoming operative on report to the head of the Department.! (3) The Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal was set up in 1936 as a resultof an agreement reached between the Treasury and the Staff Side of the national whitley Council. This Tribunal deals with questions on which there has beenfailure between Government Departments and recognised Associations of CivilServants within the scope of the National Whitley Council for the administrative and Legal Departments of the Civil Service to reach agreement by negotiationaffecting the emoluments, weekly hours of work and leave of classes of CivilServants. This Tribunal consists of an independent Chairman, one memberdrawn from a panel appointed by the Minister of Labour as representing theChancellor of the Exchequer for the time being, and one member drawn from aPanel similarly appointed representing the Staff Side of the National whitley council.(b) Industrial Grades1. During the years 1919 and 1920 the principles of the Whitley reports were applied to Government industrial establishments by a scheme which providedfor the setting up of two types of Council, viz., Departmental Joint councils and Trade Joint Councils, and also for local machinery such as Works or YardCommittees. All but one of the existing Councils date from the years 1919 and1920. There are two types of constitution common to the Councils, one for theDepartmental Joint Councils and one for the Trade Joint Councils. A Depart-mental Joint Council may be said, in brief, to deal with matters other than wagesand trade questions, i.e., mainly domestic matters, such as the interpretation of departmental regulations, welfare and other questions on which the Trade union side may wish to make representations or which have been referred to theCouncil from a Yard or Works Committee. Wages and trade questions, whichare often common to various Departments, are dealt with on Government TradeJoint Councils.Departmental Joint Councils2.   The constitution of a Departmental Joint Council provides : (1) that the members of the Official Side shall be appointed by the Depart-ment concerned, except as to one representative appointed by theMinister of Labour and National Service, and that the members ofthe Trade Union Side shall be appointed by the Trade Unions havingmembers employed in the various establishment of the Department;(2) that the representatives shall serve for one year and be eligible forre-appointment by the Department (or the Minister of Labour and national Service) or Trade Unions as the case may be;(3) that the Council may delegate special powers to any committee itappoints;(4) that the Chairman shall be a member of the Council appointed by theDepartment concerned and the Vice-Chairman a member appointedby the Trade Union Side of the Council and that a Secretary shallbe appointed from each side of the Council. (In the case of someCouncils it has been the practice for.the Chairman to be a Ministerand in the case of others a senior officer of the Department);(5) that decisions of the Council shall normally be by agreement, but a votemay be taken by show of hands or otherwise as may be determined, noresolution being regarded as carried unless it has been approved bya majority of the members on each side of the Council. (For manyyears there has been no instance of voting);(6) that the Trade Unions or Groups of Trade Unions shall be responsiblefor the travelling and other personal expenses of their representativesattending meetings of the Council or its Committees.3. Each of the larger employing Departments has a Departmental joint council. Councils have not been set up in the case of certain Departmentsemploying only a small number of industrial workpeople. In such cases negotia-tions take place with the Trade Unions direct. 0
4. The constitution of a Government Trade Joint Council provides thatthe members of the Official Side shall be appointed by the Ministers of theDepartments concerned (including the Treasury and the Ministry of Labourand National Service), and that the members of the Trade Union Side shall beappointed by the Trade Unions having members in the various establishments.The other provisions in the constitution are similar to those contained inthe constitution of a Departmental Joint Council.5. The Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council deals with the wages of thevarious classes of industrial employees of the Admiralty. Failing settlement onthe Council, wages questions are referred by joint agreement to the industrial court for settlement. -6. The Engineering Trades Joint Council and the Miscellaneous TradesJoint Council deal with matters affecting a number of Departments, e.g., Ministryof Supply, War Office, Air Ministry and Ministry of Works. Matters affectinga single Department are frequently dealt with by direct discussion with theUnion or Unions concerned, while the Councils deal with matters of common concern to several Departments or matters which cannot be settled by Depart-mental negotiation.Failing settlement on the Engineering Trades Joint Council and the Miscel-laneous Trades Joint Council matters are referred by joint agreement to theIndustrial Court for settlement.Joint Co-ordinating Committee7. Shortly after the establishment of the Departmental Joint Councils andthe Trade Joint Councils it was decided to set up a Joint Co-ordinating Com-mittee for Government Industrial Establishments for the consideration of general service questions affecting Government industrial employees generally. TheOfficial Side of this Committee consists of representatives of the various employingDepartments and of the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and NationalService. The Trade Union Side is composed of representatives of the variousTrade Unions having members in Government industrial employment.8.   Below is a list of the various Councils in active operation.Departmental Joint Councils Admiralty Industrial Council.Air Ministry Industrial Whitley Council.Ministry of Supply Industrial Council.Ministry of Works Departmental Joint Industrial Council.His Majesty&apos;s Stationery  Office Departmental  Industrial whitley council.War Department Industrial Council.Trade Joint Councils Engineering   Trades   Joint   Council   for   Government   industrial establishments.Miscellaneous   Trades   Joint   Council   for   Government   IndustrialE stablishments.Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council.Co-ordinating Committee Joint Co-ordinating Committee for Government Industrial Establish-ments.Civil Air Transport IndustryExtract from the Constitution of the National Joint Council fpr civil air TransportProcedure for the Settlement of Differences14. Each of the employers shall, in consultation with such of the TradeUnions represented on the Council as may be concerned, save where the Councilagree special circumstances obtain requiring special arrangements, review forth -with, and from time to time, the arrangements at its establishments for thesettlement of differences with a view to establishing and maintaining procedure
to secure that as far as possible purely local questions arising at an establish-ment shall be settled at that establishment, and any such question arising shall,in the first place, be dealt with through that procedure. Failing settlement inthis manner the difference shall be reported jointly by the parties as follows :  (a) When the difference relates to a matter within the jurisdiction of aSectional Panel the report shall be made to the Secretary or joint secretaries of that Sectional Panel.(b) When the difference relates to a matter outside the purview of a SectionalPanel the report shall be made to the Secretary or Joint secretaries of the Council.15. (i) Upon a difference being reported as provided for in the precedingsub-paragraph the Sectional Panel or Council as the case may be shall (a) act as a conciliation board;(b) investigate the full facts relating to the difference;(c) make recommendations thereon and communicate them to the parties;(d) use all available means for settling the difference and for preventing a cessation of work arising from the difference.(ii) For these purposes set out in the preceding sub-paragraph the SectionalPanels and the Council may appoint conciliation committees in such manner asthe Sectional Panels and the Council may decide, with full powers to act.Provided that at any stage the parties shall not have authority to adopt termsof settlement at variance with the terms of employment decided by the appropriateSectional Panel or the Council and any question of national principle shall bereferred in the first place to the Sectional Panel concerned or to the national council as the case may be. Failing settlement through the procedure outlined in this paragraph the difference shall be determined by the appropriate SectionalPanel or the Council as the case may be under the procedure applicable to otherdifferences arising between the two sides of a Sectional Panel or the Council as outlined in the succeeding paragraphs and the parties to the difference shallaccept this procedure as binding upon each of them.16. Where any difference arises between the two sides of a Sectional Panelsteps shall be taken in the first place to exhaust all possible avenues of reaching a settlement by negotiation, and for this purpose the Sectional Panel may setup a conciliation committee in such manner as it may determine, or may refer the matter to the Council, to assist in arriving at a settlement, or may refer thedifference to the Ministry of Labour and National Service with a view to inter-vention by a conciliator. Failing settlement through this procedure or failing agreement to such a reference, the difference shall stand referred at the requestof either side to the Industrial Court appointed under the Industrial court act, 1919, and the decision of the Court shall be final and binding on the partiesto the difference.17. Where any difference arises between the two sides of the Council stepsshall be taken in the first place to exhaust all possible avenues of reaching asettlement by negotiation, and for this purpose the Council may set up aconciliation committee in such manner as the Council may determine to assist in arriving at a settlement or may refer the difference to the Ministry of Labour and national Service with a view to intervention by a conciliator. Failing settlementthrough this procedure the difference shall stand referred at the request of either side to the Industrial Court appointed under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, andthe decision of the Court shall be final and binding on the parties to the difference.Prevention of Stoppages of Work arising from Trade Disputes18. In consideration of the procedure provided in clauses 14 to 16 hereofrepresentatives of bpth sides of the Council and of the Sectional Panels shalluse their best endeavours to secure that no strike, lockout or unauthorised actionshall take place at any stage of the procedure and in the event of any stoppage of work or other unauthorised action taking place shall use their best endeavours to terminate the same.
Enclosure II to Annex BProvisions of the Conciliation Act and of the Industrial Courts Act1. The Conciliation Act, 1896This Act empowers the Minister of Labour to keep a register of allConciliation Boards which exist in individual industries, in which term isapprehended any machinery established by agreement between employers and workers for the purpose of dealing with and settling disputes between them byconciliation or arbitration.The Act further empowers the Minister of Labour where a dispute existsor is apprehended to do all or any of the following things : (a) to enquire into the circumstances and causes of the difference.   (Underthis Clause the Minister has appointed Committees of Investigationon numerous occasions);(6) to arrange a meeting under an independent Chairman, either mutually agreed or appointed by the Minister, with a view to the amicable settlement of the difference;(c) after considering the adequacy of existing machinery for conciliation,to appoint on the invitation of either party a Conciliator or Boardof Conciliation;(d) on the application of both parties to appoint an Arbitrator.2. The Industrial Courts Act, 1919This Act set up the Industrial Court, whose members are appointed by theMinister of Labour. Of these, some are independent persons, some representativesof each side of industry, and at least one must be a woman.The Act provides that trade disputes, whether existing or apprehended, maybe reported to the Minister by either of the parties and that the Minister shall take such steps as seem to him expedient for promoting a settlement. To thisend he may, if both parties consent, and provided that, if there exists in that trade or industry any agreed arrangements for settling disputes by conciliationor arbitration, there has been a failure to obtain a settlement by means of those arrangements : (i) refer the matter to the Industrial Court for settlement;(ii) refer the matter to the Arbitration of one or more persons appointedby him for settlement;(iii) refer the matter for settlement to a Board of Arbitration, consistingof equal numbers of representatives nominated by each side and anindependent Chairman appointed by the Minister.The Act further provides that the Minister may also, where a trade disputeexists or is apprehended, whether it is reported to him or not, refer any matters connected with the dispute to a Court of Inquiry consisting of a person or persons appointed by him. The Minister may authorise the Court to require by orderany person to give evidence before it on oath. The report of such a Court has tobe laid before both Houses of Parliament, and the Minister may further publish(with certain exceptions) any information obtained or conclusions arrived at bythe Court.

In pursuance of the conclusion reached at that meeting, I havecirculated a revised version of this memorandum to take account of certain views expressed during the discussions on this subject (CP. (47) 190).2. The present memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power, as its titleshows, covers a much wider scope than the particular subject discussed at themeeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on 6th June, and he has, in fact,appended a copy of his previous paper on National Wages Policy which wasconsidered by my colleagues in November last year. My observations on thismemorandum were contained in the memorandum (L.P. (46) 259) which I circu-lated then and which I now attach.3. Before attempting to deal with the additional memorandum which theMinister of Fuel and Power has now submitted on a National Wages Policy, i must point out that the fact that he links this subject with proposals for Govern-ment intervention in arbitration fully bears out my own contention that the issues involved in alterations to the present arbitration machinery cannot fail to have much wider repercussions. A national wages policy such as that advocated bythe Minister of Fuel and Power cannot be obtained simply by an alteration ofour arbitration system, but involves a complete recasting of the whole system ofindustrial relations which has been built up in this country over the past half-century.4. I suggest that the Minister of Fuel and Power is understating theposition when he says that &apos;&apos; it may be true that the existing system has succeeded in avoiding some strikes.&quot; As I have endeavoured to show, industrial relations in this country work remarkably smoothly and with the minimum of disturbance.There is not a merely fortuitous connection between the development of jointorganisation in industry since 1919 and the very much greater measure ofindustrial peace that we have enjoyed in this post-war period compared withthat following the 1914-18 War; nor should we assume that the troubles that have been experienced in other countries, e.g., the United States and France, haveno lessons for us. The embarrassments which those countries have experiencedsince VJ-day are, to my mind, not unconnected with the attempt of their Govern-ments to intervene directly in wages questions. (I am not, of course, referring to the recent Hartley-Taf t labour legislation in the United States.)5. The Minister of Fuel and Power suggests that the present system ofindustrial relations &quot; provides no assurance or even likelihood that due account would be taken, not only of the circumstances of the particular industry con-cerned, but also of the wider issues affecting the economy of the country as awhole.&quot; I cannot accept this contention. The Government have made clear to both sides of industry in considerable detail the general economic considerations to which, in the national interest, they should have regard in their considerationof wages questions. These considerations are, in fact, a frequent subject ofdiscussion in particular wage negotiations.6. The objectives enumerated in paragraph 4 of the Minister of Fuel and power&apos;s memorandum seem to be dependent on considerable subsidies by the State
in the form of family allowances. It is also suggested that, over and above acertain minimum, wages should be consistently related (a) on grounds of relativeskill, and (6) according to the requirements of the man-power situation. It isdifficult to see, however, how these two requirements could, in practice, beharmonised, still less how a consistent relationship could be maintained. On theparticular question of relative skills I do not see how any scale could be assessed,which would have the slightest chance of acceptance by the workers concerned and by industry generally.7. The proposal in paragraph 7 appears to contemplate that before negotia-tions take place there should in all cases be a pronouncement by the central advisory Council. It is difficult to see how such pronouncements would be con-fined to a purely objective statement of economic facts and the procedure would,in practice, amount to a compulsory Court of Inquiry in advance of negotiations,which would result in those negotiations being reduced to little more than aformality. I cannot agree with the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s contention that such a scheme would not weaken the position of the trade unions engagedin particular negotiations. In my view, it would, in fact, destroy all sense ofresponsibility on the part of both sides, and make it impossible to maintain theauthority of the constitutional machinery.G. A. I.Ministry of Labourand National Service, S.W. 1,8th July, 1947.Enclosure to Annex C[L.P. (46) 25929th October, 1946]NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in L.P. (46) 255 the Minister of Fuel and Power sets out proposals for aNational Wages Policy and in addition makes certain suggestions as to means for combating the present shortage of labour. Whilst I appreciate the care andthoughtfulness which has gone into its preparation I think it necessary to makethe following observations on this memorandum for the consideration of mycolleagues.2. I agree that in regard to wages there are two main problems facingIndustry and the Government at the present time, namely : (a) how to achieve an overall stability of wages, and(b) how to secure any selective movement of wages which may be found tobe necessary for the benefit of vital under-manned industries (seeparagraph 12 below) without destroying that overall stability whichis an essential requirement.I feel bound to say, however, that I am not in agreement with the methodsproposed in L.P. (46) 255 for dealing with these problems.3. If I understand these proposals correctly, the Minister of Fuel and power suggests that a National Wages Authority should be constituted,consisting of representatives of Government and Employers&apos; and Workers&apos;Organisations, whose function would &apos; be to make recommendations to theGovernment regarding wages changes. It is not stated in detail how the Govern-ment would deal with these recommendations, but it appears to be contemplated that the decisions would be definitely governmental decisions (paragraph 15).This seems to leave no escape from a situation in which the decisions thus givencould be debated in Parliament. In the result, wages might become a politicalissue. This to my mind is an insuperable objection to the proposal. I think thesituation which would result would be disastrous to our whole system of industrial relations.
4. It is stated (paragraph 16) that the National Wages Authority, could operate either in response to applications from different industries or by itselfinitiating proposals for wage changes. This would mean that applications of&apos;an irresponsible and frivolous character could be put in to the National WagesAuthority, on whom would devolve the unpleasant task of rejecting them, thedecision being a Government decision. A union or extremists within a unioncould foment an agitation and place all the blame for failure on the Government.This in my view is a state of affairs that should at all costs be avoided.5. From paragraph 23 I understand that the Authority would also concern itself with the actual nature of the wages structure of particular industries,including piece rates. This is an impossible task to set a central authority,,which could not fulfil it with all the detail and precision which piece-rate andbonus systems demand. Even the present centra! negotiating bodies of the separate industries avoid the actual fixation of piece-work prices and in,no circumstances could a satisfactory result be achieved otherwise than by discus-sion at the shop level. The proposal contained in this paragraph is, indeed,directly in conflict with the widely accepted view that the maximum co-opera-tion between workers and management in the factory must be achieved. Toremove from this sphere the discussion of piece-work prices would be a. retrograde step, with the most serious consequence. In my view this proposal takes insuffi-cient account of the extremely complex nature of the general wages structure,which in most industries is a close fabric of national, district and other agree-ments designed to provide the maximum flexibility within a stable framework.6. The memorandum appears to be devoted largely to wages (or earnings)only. Wage rates, however, cannot be considered in isolation from other terms and conditions of employment to which they are intimately related under existing agreements. In my view, it would be impracticable for any national authorityto concern itself with wages only while leaving other terms and conditions tothe full discretion of the collective bargaining system.7. On the other hand, paragraph 6 contains a direct statement that &apos;&apos; wemust exercise some control over the relative attractiveness of wages and condi-tions in different industries.&quot; I am not clear as to the precise meanings tobe attached to the words &quot;control&quot; and &quot;conditions,&quot; but if, as might beinferred, the intention is that anything calculated to improve the amenities ofa particular industry is to be prevented because of competition with industries of more importance, the idea seems to me unsound. I do not think that this can be the intention, but I feel it necessary to draw attention to the statement.8. The proposals contained in the memorandum do not mention the meansof enforcing the Government decisions on wages. If an application is rejectedthere may well be a series of strikes. There might, indeed, be strikes, officialor unofficial, whilst the application for an increase was under consideration.It is not stated in the memorandum how the decisions will be promulgated, what form they will take or what steps will be taken to see that they are properly operated. If the decisions are to have any statutory significance the exact sanctions to be applied must be stated before it can be considered whetherthey are likely to be effective. Moreover, our experience in wage regulationshows that enforcement is impossible unless an adequate inspection staff is pro-vided. I would, however, emphasise that the success of an industrial relationspolicy depends not on the effectiveness of legal sanctions but on the willing-acceptance of the settlements in question. This under the system of collective bargaining derives from the fact that the settlements are negotiated by theaccredited representatives of the men, who act under the democratic constitutionof their respective unions.9. It must be borne in mind that piece nates must be fixed to provide theaverage worker with the incentive to work for a certain standard of remuneration.Particularly skilful or adaptable workers will always be found who will obtainhigher earnings. In any system of enforcing maximum earnings the question will arise whether a worker who exceeds the maximum has done so through anillegal arrangement with his employer or simply because of his extra skill.It would clearly be impossible, and indeed undesirable, to deprive the goodworker of the rewards of his extra skill, but this dilemma would have to be faced if it were ever decided to enforce maxima. There is, of course, the further38633 &apos;     P
complication that if a piece rate is fixed too high the Government would be under the necessity of reducing the rates, a procedure which; over a wide field of industry, would be certain to meet with the most violent and indignantopposition.10. My colleagues should be left under no misapprehension as to the effects of removing the full authority for the determination of terms and conditionsfrom the two sides of industry. In paragraph 8 of his memorandum, the Ministerof Fuel and Power refers to &apos;&apos; Defects of the traditional collective bargainingsystem.&quot; These remarks, however, are not valid criticisms of the system of joint negotiation as such, but a statement of what might occur if either or bothsides of industry operated the existed machinery without adequate knowledgeof the general economic position and without exercising their proper respon-sibilities. Furthermore, we must keep in mind the positive advantages andAchievements which have led to the system of collective bargaining being supportedand encouraged by successive Governments since 1919. It is hardly necessaryfor me to redevelop in detail the arguments in favour of the system. I would only stress that the process of adjustment of terms and conditions by jointnegotiation, quite apart from its positive stablising effect on the course ofwages claims, exerts a decisive influence upon the general harmony of industrial relations as a whole. So far as the workers are concerned this harmony is foundedupon the full sense of responsibility which they have acquired from long experienceof free negotiation which, in turn, is based on the confidence of their members in the results of this method of settling terms and conditions. To remove fromthe employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s organisations the full authority for the settle-ment of terms and conditions would not merely sacrifice the machinery whichhas been built up with such care and operated with such success over manyyears, but would do much to destroy the general harmony of industrial relations which has been such an encouraging feature both during the late war and inthe present difficult period of industries reconversion. A sense of collective responsibility and the consequent willingness to abide by jointly negotiated agree-ments are the main bases on which industrial stability rests. They would be destroyed if the parties knew that the final authority on questions of terms andconditions rested not with themselves but in the last resort, with the Government;that in fact the only effective negotiation would be with the Government.11. It cannot, moreover, be too strongly stressed that direct government intervention in the wages field removes the settlement of disputes from the field of industrial relations and brings one or other of the parties concerned intodirect conflict with the Government. A strike in such circumstances would, ineffect, be a strike against the Government, which would then have to take full responsibility for any situation which might arise. The disastrous effects of just such a system, which has always been studiously avoided in this country,have been only too clearly demonstrated in the course of the recent industrial unrest in the United States of America, which I have had some opportunity ofstudying at first hand.12. I should like to comment in particular on the second of the two proposedfunctions of the National Wages Authority (paragraph 17 (b) of L.P. (46) 255),namely, &apos;&apos; to develop a structure of relative wages which would help the flow oflabour in the directions desired and to prevent a flow in the opposite direction.&quot;In paragraph 7 of his memorandum, the Minister of Fuel and Power points outthat &apos;&apos; wages rates are not the only, and perhaps not even the most importanteconomic incentive. In present circumstances, hours of work, holidays, housing,working conditions and amenities may play even a greater role in attractingpersons to different industries or in keeping them once they have arrived.&quot; Withthis I would fully agree and would go further and suggest that economic incentivesare by no means the only factors determining the industry in which an individual&quot;worker chooses to be employed. Personal preferences, nearness to place of residence and means of transport, local custom and other traditions all play their part. A great deal of detailed investigation is needed before the influence ofrelative wage rates on the manning of particular industries can be accuratelygauged. This will no doubt be one of the first problems to be considered by thereconstituted National Joint Advisory Council and its Joint consultative committee.
13. . The Minister of Fuel and Power also mentions the objective of elimination -ting &quot;unduly low wages and. &apos; sweating &apos; in badly organised industries.&quot; TheWages Councils Act and similar legislation contain ample powers for dealingwith such a situation and, if there exists &apos;&apos; sweating &apos;&apos; in any industry or sectionof it, I should like my attention drawn to it at once.14. In considering the part which they should play in promoting the attain-ment of the objectives I have mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the Governmentshould scrupulously abstain from any action which would impair the presentsystem of joint voluntary negotiation of terms and conditions. It has beenaccepted by my colleagues that the Government, in consultation with representa-tives of the employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s organisations, has its part to play in securing that the organisations responsible for collective bargaining exercise their&apos; functions with full knowledge of the country&apos;s economic requirements. TheNational Joint Advisory Council has now been reconstituted for this precisepurpose and the outlines of the country&apos;s economic situation and needs have beenput before them by the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade. I feel bound to point outthat the machinery of the National Joint Advi sory Council is designed not merely for &quot; discussing the problems involved &quot; but rather to provide a regular systemof consultation between the Government and the two sides of industry responsiblefor collective bargaining. I have every confidence that, these consultations willprovide the Government with a ready means of obtaining an authoritative and representative view on problems as they arise and that the organisations ofemployers and workers will have a regular means of assessing all the factorsrelevant to their consideration. These consultations are still at an early stage and their efficiency must be judged by their results. Meanwhile, I feel that i must warn my colleagues of what, in my view, would be the disastrous effects ofany attempt to undermine the authority of the system of joint voluntary negotia-tion upon which, encouraged and assisted by the Government, I am convinced the solution of our present problems must depend.15. In various paragraphs in his memorandum the Minister of Fuel and power refers to the need to control profits, and in paragraph 26 he suggests thatit would be valuable to obtain the views of the Board of Trade on the availablemeans to tighten up and extend the existing price control machinery. Myimpression has been that the field of price control is strictly limited by the prac-practicability of enforcement. I fully agree that, if wages are to be compulsorilytied to a particular level, an efficient price control for the whole field of inclustrywould be an essential corollary. I should be surprised to learn, however, that the-Board of Trade consider price control over the whole field to be practicable.16. The Minister of Fuel and Power also deals at the end of his paperwith the problem of the general labour shortage and suggests in paragraphs 29-30that we should take deliberate steps to reduce the scope of industries consciouslyselected as overmanned, thus forcibly releasing labour for the genuinely under-manned industries. I examined this suggestion in the paper L.P. (46) 175, whichI submitted to this Committee in July last, and I cannot do better than repeat the following paragraph from that paper :  &quot; The second method, i.e., the deliberate creation of unemployment in less essential industries in order to force workers so rendered unemployedto more essential jobs, must also be ruled out for the following reasons : (a) This roundabout method of compulsion would be little, if any, more&apos;palatable to the workers involved than direct compulsion. To thepublic at large it would appear to be deliberately created austerityfor reasons which would be ill understood, and it would be mostunpopular.(b) It is most doubtful whether the policy could be effectively enforced..\c) There can be no guarantee that the labour discharged would belabour of the kind required for the work to be manned up.Employers required to discharge workers usually select those whoare least vigorous and adaptable. There would also be a grave riskof such difficulties as men being discharged in districts wherewomen were required. Nor, without directions, would it bepossible to ensure, even if the redundant workers were of the kind38633 E 2
required, that they, in fact, went to the jobs most needing workersinstead of drifting into other work no more essential than thatin which they had been rendered surplus. The sole result of thepolicy might be to create unemployment.&quot;17. With regard to paragraph 31, I fully agree that we should increase asfar as possible the proportion of our population engaged in productive employ-ment. This is one of the major objectives of the Prosperity Campaign publicity.I fully agree also that the improvement of the efficiency of our industries is of thefirst importance, and I have no doubt that the Ministers concerned are takingevery possible step to this end.G.

ANNEX D[CP. (47) 202Mh July, 1947]cabinet national WAGES policy memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn connection with the memoranda submitted by the Minister of Fuel and power (CP. (47) 189) and the Minister of Labour and National Service(CP. (47) 190 and 195), it may be helpful to the Cabinet if I review briefly the stage reached as a result of previous Ministerial discussions.2. &quot;Wages Policy&quot; is invoked chiefly as a remedy for three currenttroubles (i) the tendency for wages generally to rise relatively unchecked owing tothe current pressure of inflationary forces and the strong positionof the workers in full employment ;(ii) the problem of securing relative rates of wages and earnings which will assist in manning-up the under-manned industries and in restrainingdrafts on man-power by fully-manned or less essential industries ; and, (iii) the problem of securing a wage structure related to output and capableof stimulating the utmost productivity.3. The problem of resisting inflationary trends is of great and indeedcritical importance. When it comes to mandatory action this must largely bedealt with as a matter of fiscal and general economic policy, but there is,none the less, much that can be done in the sphere of education and publicity tobring the facts before the attention of all concerned in wages and hours claims.There is a real need for courageous leadership and exposition by Ministersgenerally and by trade union leaders generally in connection with the dangers ofthe spiral drift which has taken place in regard to wages and hours claims and concessions. (Flours are, of course, no less important than wages. Indeed,in some respects it is more important at the present moment to prevent decreasesof hours than increases in wages.) In my opinion, as a Government we are atfault in that we have not had enough of such leadership. Socialisation? Yes.Control of investment and private industry ? Yes. But when it comes to wagesand hours which, at any rate, for a material period are bound to have serious repercussions on the whole economy through their effect on costs and prices and,incidentally, even perhaps most of all, on the manning of the basic under-manned industries, to which I refer below there appears to be a wish in sometrade union quarters and even among some Ministers to adopt a laissez faireattitude and to assert that everything will quickly come right in the wash ofindustrial adaptation.4. Yet, if an economic smash comes, it will be the Government that will beblamed- from all quarters-and it will deserve to be blamed, if Ministersgenerally fail in the courage to hold aloft the torch of economic fact and truth.Can we go on attacking the Manchester School of thought when we argue withthe Opposition and private industry, and at the same time adopt a ManchesterSchool attitude where our own friends and our own &apos;&apos; interests &apos;&apos; are concerned ?In all these matters, Socialists should apply only one test the public interest,which in the not very long run is also the interest of the workers. As I said in my Margate speech (which was approved by the Prime Minister and well received by the delegates), we stand for the worker&apos;s right to his full share ofproduction, but we are in danger of overdrawing on our overdrafts. The recep-tion of this speech at Margate, my contacts with the Parliamentary Labour Party
and my experience at public meetings convince me that the workers are readyto face the facts if our Trade Union colleagues and ourselves are ready to statethem courageously and fully. The workers must be persuaded to abandon thementality of nineteenth century capitalism, to realise the social consequences ofthe blessings of full employment, and to recognise that in our fairly advanced stage of transition to a new social order, the first economic duty of each man andwoman is to the nation as a whole.5. What I have said in paragraph 3 about the problem of inflation alsoapplies to some extent to the question of using wages as an instrument forsecuring correct distribution of man-power. On this, however, there is reasonto believe that wages policy can make a significant contribution and here thequestions arise- (i) How far do any wage differentials which are practicable in factinfluence man-power distribution?(ii) How far are existing methods failing to secure the necessary readjust-ments? and(iii) What practicable and acceptable further measures can be devised?6. It is with this aspect that I suggest the Cabinet should concern itselfat this stage. The question of an incentive structure of wages, although of verygreat importance, raises distinct issues which should be considered separately.7. I annex a paper prepared in consultation with the Economic Sectionof the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Labour showing the recent  trends whichare relevant.   The following comments may be made at this stage : (i) So far as minimum weekly wages are concerned, labour in the under-manned industries is in some cases paid more than labour in similaroccupational conditions in other industries which compete with the under-manned industries for labour supply (paragraph 2 andTables 3 and 4 of Annex). This wage differential is not, however,very great and is probably insufficient to compensate for the unpleasantcharacter of the work. It is unlikely, therefore, to be a sufficientinducement to overcome the reluctance of a worker to leave his existingemployment and enter one. of the under-manned industries.(ii) In agriculture, the prospective increase of the agricultural minimum wage to 90s. per week will still leave the agricultural labourer with a lower wage than that paid to railway porters in the neighbouringtowns, whose work is less skilled and less arduous.(iii) In textiles, the rise of women&apos;s hourly earnings in the cotton industry as compared with pre-war is less than the corresponding rise inwomen&apos;s hourly earnings in general engineering, which is the principalcompeting industry for women&apos;s labour in Lancashire.(iv) The greatest relative gain in earnings in an under-manned industry hasbeen in coal mining. It is significant that in this industry the approach to the 1947 labour target is closer than in most other under-manned industries.8. It appears to be common ground that all concerned in the settlement ofwages and conditions of labour should be as fully aware as possible of the nationalneed for checking inflation and for manning-up essential under-manned industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power argues in CP. (47) 189, paragraphs 7-9 that legislation should be promoted to establish a new body a Central AdvisoryCouncil to pass judgment on any wage claims in the first place before negotiationstook place. The Minister of Labour in OP. (47) 190 argues in favour of retaining broadly the present machinery with certain secondary modifications.9. I find myself in sympathy both with the Minister of Labour &apos;s reluctance to make an abrupt and possibly perilous departure from the established structure of industrial negotiations and with the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s argument for a much more vigorous and effective injection of national economic policy intowages settienientib. There are good arguments on both sides, and I am anxious that we shall adopt a policy which makes the best of both cases. I accordinglyput forward the following proposals as a definite step forward in the right direction, on the understanding in any event that we shall keep a careful watch onthe wayr things work out and shall not hesitate to take stronger action if necessary.
Enclosure to Annex DcourseWar,1. The General Level of Wages. The accompanying table shows these of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of money wage rates since the end of theMinistryTable 1.  Weekly Money Wage RatesSeptember 1939 ...June 1945December 1945June 1946December 1946jane 19471001481524160165166*Measurement of the course of &quot; real &quot; wages is attended by all the difficulties of estimating the rise in the Cost of Living realistically, over the last eight years.The following table can only claim to be illustrative of the general position.(i) the Cabinet should accept the proposals of the Minister of Labour inparagraph 20 of CP. (47) 190.(ii) the Minister of Labour should be invited to set up in his own department and Section on Wages and Hours Policy to keep track, on behalf of theGovernment, of all claims affecting wages, hours, and working eon-ditions and report to him promptly the effects, if any, which each application is likely to have on the amount of man-power required,; on the charges made to the public by the industry or service, on nationalsubsidies if any, and on similar claims put forward or likely to be putforward by other industries;(iii) the Minister of Labour should be invited to circulate reports on eachsuch claim to all interested Ministers, these reports wherever necessarybeing brought before the Lord Presidents Committee;(iv) the Minister of Labour should find his own means of seeing thattribunals, courts, wages councils, or other bodies concerned are suitablyinformed on the national interests as disclosed by the reports aboveproposed;(v) the Minister of Labour should be invited to keep up a progressing systemof all wage claims and to ensure where necessary, in consultation withother Ministers concerned, that suitable representations are madewhere the handling of claims appears to be unduly dilatory;(vi) I should make arrangements for the Central Economic Planning staff and for the Economic Section to keep in close touch with the proposedWages Policy Section of the Ministry of Labour and in that way tokeep the Minister fully informed of the relationship between wages policy considerations and the working out of economic policy andeconomic planning targets.11, As I have said above, however, the situation calls for more drastic action,and wages and hours policy cannot be considered in isolation from other urgenteconomic questions on which we shall also have to decide. The administrative measures I have proposed should help, not least in keeping us in closer touch with developments affecting hours and wages, but they will achieve little unless they areaccompanied by the change of attitude at all levels to which I have referred. Asthe Minister responsible for general economic information policy, I shall do myutmost to facilitate this change of attitude through publicity methods, but these will be quite inadequate without the right leadership from Ministers and in theTrade Union movement. If my colleagues agree with my views on the subject am sure, however, that their full co-operation will be forthcoming to this end.(Initialled) H.

The Relative Levels of Wages in Different Occupations. No accurate estimate of the relative wage attractions of &apos;&apos; undermanned &apos;&apos; vis-a-vis other occupations would be possible without detailed research. The following figuresonly give a general outline of the position, and too much significance must not beattached to small differences in the wages given.Table 3 compares the minimum rates of wages for men prevailing in some ofthe undermanned industries, and in certain other occupations. It is seen that,whilst marked advances have been made in the wages of some of the undermannedindustries, the resulting wage differential in their favour (relative to certain other occupations) is not so far as minimum weekly wages are concerned very great.

The evidence of &apos;&apos; average earnings &apos;&apos; figures on the comparative wageattractions of different industries must always be treated with considerablereserve, owing to a variety of statistical subtleties which often made them verymisleading. As far as they go, however, the hourly earnings for July 1945 suggestthat at the end of the War coal had advanced its relative wage position very considerably, and cotton slightly but that the wage levels of the other under-manned industries had lagged severely behind. However, by October 1945, thefigures would make it appear that ironfounding and the gas industry had regainedtheir pre-war relativity, and brick-making (&amp;c.) had advanced on it. whilst tin-plate and steel sheet, and laundries, were still lagging.
ANNEX E[CM. (47)62nd Conclusions]CABINET 62 (47)EXTRACT from Conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinet held at fl.0 downing street, S.W.1, on Thursday, 11&apos;th July, 1947, at 10 a.m.&quot;a&quot; &quot;rt&quot; &quot;tv1 -7t&quot; &quot;7V&quot;3.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP.(47) 189) advocating the establishment of a central advisory councilto investigate and report on claims for higher wages in the lightof the relevant economic and social considerations, and to comment on the advisability of fixing minimum wage rates for all workers.Annexed to this was a memorandum which the Minister had circulated to the Lord President&apos;s Committee setting out proposalsfor a national wages policy;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (47) 190)describing the existing arbitration machinery for dealing with questions of wages and conditions of work and opposing the sugges-tion that a central arbitral body should be established;(iii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP: (47) 195)commenting on the proposals made in CP. (47) 189 and covering amemorandum which the Minister had circulated to the Lord Presi-dent&apos;s Committee on the proposals made by the Minister of Fuel and power for a national- wages policy; and(iv) a memorandum by the- Lord President (CP; (47) 202)urging that more active steps should be taken to bring home thefacts of the economic situation to all those concerned with claims for higher wages or shorter hours, and suggesting certain administrative action which would help the Government to exercisemore control over changes in wages and hours of work.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Lord presidents committee had been increasingly concerned about the effect on thenational economy of the unco-ordinated increases in wages and reductions in hours of work which had taken place since the end ofthe war. But, although almost a year had elapsed since he had submitted to the Committee proposals for a national wages policy,no recommendations on these proposals had been made by theCommittee to the Cabinet. The Minister of Labour claimed thatthe results of the working of the existing system had been most satisfactory, and in support of this had compared the reductions in hours of work, the increases in wage rates, and the number of dayslost through trade disputes since the war with the corresponding figures for 1919-20. It had to be borne in mind, however, that hoursof work in 1945 were already much lower than hours of work at theend of the 1914-18 war, and that the much greater rise in wage ratesbetween 1914 and 1920 could be explained by the fact that afterthe 1914-18 war all controls had been abandoned and no attempthad been made to stabilise wages by means of food subsidies. Again,the number of working days lost through trade disputes in the past three years could not be fairly compared with the number lost afterthe 1914-18 war, since conditions then were entirety different. TheWages Policy.(previous reference:CM. (47) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)
failure of the existing system to work satisfactorily could be illustrated from the experience of the coal-mining industry, in whichit had been necessary to agree to shorter hours, and it would benecessary to face a demand for higher wages, which in turn would lead to an increase in the cost of coal. Moreover, labour recruited from Ireland for work in the mines was drifting away into betterpaid employment in the motor industry. He recognised that anyproposal to set up a central advisory council would encounter someopposition from trade unions, but he believed that, if it could bemade clear that it was not intended that the Government shouldintervene in the settlement of individual wage claims, the proposal would be generally accepted. It was an essential part of his scheme that the council should advise on all wage claims made by tradeunions, including claims which the employers&apos; side were willing to concede, and that its functions should not be restricted to dealingwith those claims which were to go to arbitration. He also regarded it as important that the council should comment on the advisability of determining minimum wage rates for all workers.The Minister of Labour said that, in his view, it would be disastrous to attempt to consolidate the existing machinery for arbitration in a central body. Nor would it be possible to requireall claims to be referred to a central advisory council withoutweakening the position of the trade unions and destroying all sense of responsibility in the parties to wage negotiations, sincepronouncements by the council could not be confined to purelyobjective statements of economic facts, and the procedure wouldin practice amount to a compulsory court of enquiry in advanceof negotiations. It was incorrect to suggest that the Governmenthad been unable to exercise any influence on wages claims. Forexample, it had been possible to secure the rejection of the claim of building workers for higher wages. Nor was it true, as hadbeen suggested, that each arbitral body dealt with the claims comingbefore it without reference to the general economic situation or tothe position in other industries, In his opinion, the right course was to continue the policy of drawing arbitrators from a selectedgroup of persons who could be depended upon to take a broad andstatesmanlike view, and of employing the same person as chairmanof a number of wages councils or wages boards. He was preparedto accept the suggestions made by the Lord President in para-graph 10 of CP. (47) 202, but he suggested that it would be useful if in the first instance there were discussions with representativesof the trade unions.The Lord President said that in conditions of full employment the Government could not keep control of the economic situationunless they found a solution for the problems presented by unco-ordinated increases in wages and reductions in hours of work. Thetrade union leaders had, on the whole, shown a considerable sense of responsibility, but a great deal remained to be done in educatingthe rank and file in such matters as the effect of uncontrolled wage increases on our ability to find markets for our exports. Over thepast two years the Government had repeatedly been embarrased by concessions made in individual industries without regard to theeffect on other industries or on the national economy as a whole,and he sympathised with the view of the Minister of Fuel and power that positive action to remedy this was necessary. On theother hand, he did not think it would be safe to make such an abruptdeparture from the established methods of negotiation as would be involved in setting up a central advisory council. Hitherto, theGovernment had not kept in close enough touch with the parties concerned in claims for higher wages or shorter hours, and it seemedto him essential that the Minister of Labour should set up an organisation to keep track of all claims and to report promptly theeffect which the granting of each claim was likely ,to have on theman-power required, on the charges made to the consumer, on633 g
national subsidies, and on similar claims put forward by other workers. The Minister should also find means of ensuring thattribunals, courts cf enquiry, wages councils and other similar bodieswere suitably informed about the national interests. It would alsobe desirable for the Central Economic Planning Staff and theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Office to furnish the Minister with information about the relationship between wages policy considera-tions and the working out of economic policy and economic planningtargets. These proposals represented only a first step towardsdealing with the wages problem, but he was convinced that if theywere put into effect vigorously many of the present difficulties couldbe avoided.The Minister of Health said that if the Government intervenedin wage negotiations in the sphere of private enterprise they would inevitably be regarded as siding with the employers. Thus, therewas great resentment among the building workers, who knew thatthe Government had encouraged the employers to reject their wagesclaims. On the other hand, he did not see how the Governmentcould escape responsibility for intervening in claims affectingworkers in socialised industries, in the local Government service orin industries, such as agriculture, which were largely dependenton Government subsidies; and he felt that it would be necessaryto devise a procedure for settling such claims which would openlyrecognise the interests of the Government. If a satisfactoryprocedure could be worked out, it would not only protect the Govern-ment against unreasonable claims, but would also have an indirectbeneficial effect on negotiations in private industrjaThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential thatthe Government should take some positive action. He was in favourof the proposals put forward in paragraph 10 of CP. (47) 202 in preference to the establishment of a central advisory council, buthe thought there was a case for an enquiry by a committee ofMinisters into the proper procedure for handling wages claims by workers in socialised industries or in the local Government service.He was also in favour of encouraging public discussion of theproblems of wages policy, particularly by trade union leaders. Itwas interesting to note that, whereas at the Labour party conference it had been generally agreed that direction of labour was out of the question, the General Secretary of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union had now suggested that a limited amountof direction of labour might be necessary.The Minister of Transport said that he viewed with somemisgiving the suggestion that a special tribunal might be set up todeal with claims made by workers in socialised industries. these industries now covered a very large part of the national economy,and experience had shown that Government intervention, which infact meant political intervention, was not likely to provide effectiveresistance to wage increases or to encourage the downward move-ment of wages when this was necessary in the general interest.The President of the Board of Trade said that it should berecognised that in many industries the employers had at present no interest in keeping wage rates down. Thus, advice from a central advisory council on particular wages claims would be ineffectiveunless it were a preliminary to arbitration. He believed that inthe end it might be necessary to make provision for a central arbitral tribunal of a judicial kind and, though it might as yet be too early to establish such a body to deal with claims by workers in private industry, it seemed desirable that a special tribunal should be setup to deal with claims from workers in socialised industries and inthe local Government service. He supported the proposals made inparagraph 10 of CP. (47) 202 as a first step towards dealing with
the problem, and he suggested that it would be useful to have a frankand informal talk with representatives of trade unions.Other points in discussion were :- (a) The Minister of Agriculture said that he favoured theappointment of a central advisory council, provided that its functions were confined to the collection and dissemination ofinformation and advice on wages questions. He pointed out thatthe recent increase in the minimum agricultural wage hadimmediately been followed by a claim for increased wages from road-workers. The General Secretary of the National Union of municipal and General Workers had taken a reasonable view aboutthe relation between agricultural workers&apos; and roadworkers&apos; wages,but he was unable to control the activities of the individual branchesof the union.(&amp;) An unsatisfactory feature of the existing methods of handling claims by local Government servants for increased wageswas the presence on the employers&apos; side of trade unionists who werelocal authority members.(c) The Minister of Food said that the risks involved in not taking positive action to control wages should not be under-estimated. Unless the Government found a way of influencingwages so as to induce labour to flow in the desired direction, their economic policy would fail.(d) The Home Secretary pointed out that the habit of judgingwage rates in particular industries by reference to the wages paidin corresponding industries was deep-seated and that it would bedifficult to eradicate the belief that roadmen and other rural workersmust always receive higher rates of wages than agricultural workers. He believed that a central advisory council, on the lines suggested by the Minister of Fuel and Power, would prove necessaryin the long run, and he suggested that, as a preliminary step,arrangements might be made to submit to arbitral bodies who were considering wages claims, objective statements of the economic factors affecting these claims.(e) The Minister of Education said that, though it was truethat the two sides of the cotton industry had agreed on shorter working hours without reference to the Government, he believedthat the shorter hours were justified in view of the large numberof married women employed in the industry. It was impossible to expect workers who had been employed in munition factories duringthe war to resume work in cotton mills at lower wage rates without some compensation, and the only way to obtain higher output wouldbe to ask the workers to work additional hours at over-time rates.The central advisory council proposed by the Minister of Fuel and power would be resented by the workers as involving Governmentinterference and, in his view, the right course was to adopt the suggestions put forward by the Lord President and to arrange for discussions on the question of wages policy with representatives ofthe trade unions.(/) The Minister of Transport pointed out that the chairmen of the Railway Companies had refused to take responsibility for deciding whether to accept the award of the recent court of enquiry into the claims of railway workers for higher wages and reducedhours. The award had been accepted by the unions concerned andhe had now to decide whether he or the Railway ExecutiveCommittee should accept it.(g) The Minister of Health said that the rejection of thebuilding workers&apos; claims for higher wages had affected the outputof houses. The building industry was considering a scheme for payment by results, but the shortages of materials experienced inthe past year and the forecast that, owing to transport difficulties,
there would be difficulty in delivering materials next spring werenot likely to encourage the workers to agree to such a scheme.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that,though it was clearly the duty of the Government to adopt a positivewages policy, it should be borne in mind that in those countries wherethe Government had intervened directly in questions of wages and hours of work the results had not always been satisfactory. Theproposal of the Minister of Fuel and Power seemed to lead to fixing of wages by the Government, and for this reason it would be unwise to adopt it, at any rate for the present. He thought that the suggestions made by the Lord President in paragraph 10 of CP.(47) 202 should be followed up and that there should be an enquiry into what special new machinery ought to be set up in order todeal with claims by workers in socialised industries and the localgovernment service. It would also be helpful if a few of theMinisters mainly concerned were to have a preliminary informaltalk with representatives of the trade unions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President and the Minister of Labour toarrange for a preliminary informal discussion on questions of wages policy between Ministers and repre-sentatives of the trade unions.(2) Approved the suggestions made in paragraph 10 of CP.(47) 202, and invited the Lord President and theMinister of Labour to take steps to give effect to them.(3) Agreed that the Committee on the Socialisation of Indus-tries, with the addition of the Minister of Health, should consider what machinery should be set up to deal with claims for higher wages and shorter hours made by workers in socialised industries or industries largely dependent on Government subsidies and by workers employed by local authorities.* * * * * *
