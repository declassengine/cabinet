&amp;^c*j*y j  \jt4-Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1950SECRET Copy No, 3 2CP. (50) 7320th April, 1950.CABINETCHINAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsChina will be one of the subjects to be discussed Avith the United states secretary of State, Mr. Acheson, during his visit to this country in May.Preliminary talks at the official level are to take place in London upon the arrival on 24th April of a group of American officials led by Dr. Jessup, United.States Ambassador-at-large, who has recently completed a tour of the Far Eastand South and South-East Asia. In these circumstances I consider it desirable to review the position in China, and to consider the line to be taken in the forth-coming talks with the United States.Summary2. Part I of this paper contains a review of recent events relating to China,and reveals a profoundly unsatisfactory situation. Normal diplomatic relationsbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Chinese People&apos;s Government havenot yet been established; the condition of United Kingdom business interests inChina has gravely deteriorated; the question of Chinese representation in theUnited Nations has led to a boycott by the Soviet and satellite states of allUnited Nations bodies in session, and the deadlock remains unresolved; the HongKong aircraft case has given rise to many difficulties particularly with the UnitedStates; and in recent weeks there has been growing evidence of Russian military aid to China. Part II of the paper examines the considerations affecting thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and&quot; reaches the conclusion that this policy should be continued, and that if there it to be a break in our relations with China,the initiative and responsibility for that break should be left to the Chinese.The policy of the United States towards China is examined in Part III andinstances are given where the inconsistencies of that policy adversely affect UnitedKingdom interests and are harmful to our common aim of preventing the per-manent alienation of China from the West. It is recommended that the wholefield of our respective relations with China should be discussed in the course ofthe forthcoming bipartite talks with the United States Secretary of State. Asregards United Kingdom business interests, it is not practicable at present totake any concrete measures for their assistance except to make representations to the Chinese People&apos;s Government on the basis of their immediate difficulties.Until normal diplomatic relations are established with the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment, the effectiveness of these representations is likely to be limited.Part I.-Review of Recent EventsRecognition3. In accordance with the recommendation in CP. (49) 248 of12th December, 1949, the Cabinet decided on 15th December (CM. (49) 72ndConclusions, Minute 3) that de jure recognition should be accorded to the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government, and that Government was accordingly notified of thisdecision on 6th January, 1950. The selection of the date depended upon a38598 B
number of factors. It was clear that unanimity among Commonwealth countries was not possible. India had accorded recognition on 30th December, 1949;Pakistan followed suit on 4th January and Ceylon on 7th January, 1950. Canada,Australia and New Zealand were reluctant to accord early recognition, while SouthAfrica did not want to be among the-first countries to do so; in the event none of these Governments has as yet recognised the Chinese People&apos;s Government,Since de jure recognition by the United Kingdom, the following countries have followed suit: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Israel, Switzerland andthe Netherlands. The United States of Indonesia as a new State has-been recog;nised by the Chinese People&apos;s Government and is ready to reciprocate. The soviet union, the satellite States of Eastern Europe and also Yugoslavia had accordedrecognition before action was taken by any Commonwealth or Western Power.4. Before recognition by the United Kingdom had taken place, it was announced that Mao Tse-tung, the Chairman of the Chinese People&apos;s Government,had arrived in Moscow on 16th December, whither he was followed a fortnightlater by Chou En-lai, the Foreign Minister. Though this can only be a matter for speculation, it is possible that recognition by the United Kingdom and other western Powers while negotiations were in progress in Moscow, may havestrengthened the hands of the Chinese. In the event the conclusion was announcedoil 14th February of a Sino-Soviet Treaty and of a series of agreements. an analysis of these is contained in Foreign Office Print No. FC. 10338/38 of14th March, and it is sufficient to observe here that the conclusion of the treaty and agreements constitutes a set-back to the Western Powers and at the least a propaganda victory for both the Soviet Union and the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment. While it is possible that frictions may develop in the implementation ofthe agreements, there is as yet no evidence of this, and, for the time being at anyrate, the Soviet Union has undoubtedly strengthened its influence in China. two further agreements relating to joint Sino-Soviet exploitation of the economic resources of Sinkiang and to a joint Sino-Soviet organisation for the operationof air communications between points in Russian territory and Peking have been concluded since the return of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai to China.5. Whether because of increased Russian influence, or for other reasons which are discussed in paragraph 31, the fact remains that after more than threemonths His Majesty&apos;s Government have not yet succeeded in establishing normaldiplomatic relations with the Chinese People&apos;s Government. The communicationsexchanged between the two Governments at the time of recognition will be found at Annex A. The People&apos;s Government insisted upon preliminary and proceduraldiscussions before the establishment of normal relations, and upon their acceptanceof Mr. J. C. Hutchison as His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires for that purpose, thelatter was instructed to proceed from Nanking to Peking, where he arrived on13th February. It is fair to state that he was given every facility and wascourteously received. On 3rd March he was asked certain questions by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, to which replies were made on 17th March (theseexchanges will be found at Annex B). Since then there have been no further developments and the position must be regarded as profoundly unsatisfactory. Itshould, however, be recorded that the Chinese People&apos;s Government recently agreedto exchange Ambassadors with India, and subsequently with Sweden and Denmark.Other Powers who accorded recognition have so far made no more progress than theUnited Kingdom.6. Other aspects of the United Kingdom position in China are examinedbelow.Hong Kong Aircraft Case7. My colleagues have already considered this question in another contest(CM. (50) 19th Conclusions, Minute 2) and it is sufficient here to relate that, as early as June 1949, the Hong Kong Government requested the China NationalAviation Company (C.N.A.C.) and the Central Air Transport Corporation(C.A.T.C.), two Chinese air transport organisations, to remove their mainestablishments from Kai Tak. The Governor of Hong Kong pointed out both to the representatives of C.N.A.C. and to the United States Consul-General that,apart from the inconvenience caused to the Government of Hong Kong by thepresence in the colony of the aircraft and their maintenance depots, there was aserious risk that the Chinese Communist Government would lay claim to the
aircraft, in view of the fact that the Communist advance was proceeding rapidly and that in all probability the Communists would become the Government ofChina and as such successors to the Nationalist Government and inheritors of their property. In fact on 9th November the Managing Directors of C.N.A.C. andCA.T.C., together with eleven of the aircraft in question, flew to Peking anddefected to the Communists. The seventy aircraft remaining in Hong Kong werepromptly claimed as Communist property by some 4,000 of the employees of thetwo companies who had likewise defected. Shortly afterwards the chinese communist Foreign Minister declared that the aircraft were held in Hong Kongas a &quot;sacred property right&quot; of the Chinese People&apos;s Government and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government bore full responsibility for their safety. No attempt is made here to summarise the highly complicated legal proceedings whichsubsequently took place in the Hong Kong courts over the disputed ownership ofthese aircraft. On 4th April, His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Peking wassummoned by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, who handed him a memo-randum on the subject of the sabotage of a few of the aircraft at Hong Kong.Though this memorandum called for no reply, it was considered desirable to reject the contention of the People&apos;s Government and Mr. Hutchison was instructed todo so.  These exchanges will be found at Annex C.$lilitary Compound at Peking8. Subsequent to the relief of the Legations at Peking after the Boxer rising,no less than eleven Powers, including the United Kingdom, acquired militarycompounds (in addition to their diplomatic quarters), in which foreign garrisonswere stationed. The last British garrison left after the outbreak of war in 1939and before the war with Japan. With the lapse of time the only Powers retainingmilitary compounds were the United Kingdom, the United States, France, theNetherlands, Belgium and the Soviet Union. In January of this year the corn-pounds of the United States, France and the Netherlands were requisitioned bythe People&apos;s Government. The February agreements between that Govern -ment and the Soviet Union included a provision for the surrender ofthe military compound held by the latter (though they are believed notyet to have evacuated it). The United Kingdom compound thus remained thelast of the eleven (apart from the small Belgian barracks and the Netherlandsmarine barracks, which have apparently been overlooked), and it was accordingly decided that an offer should be made to renounce it, since the compound would clearly not be required for its original purpose, and any additional buildingwhich may be required for His Majesty&apos;s Embassy could be accommodated onthe embassy site. Before an opportunity occurred to make the offer, however, amilitary requisition notice, to take effect upon 11th April, was served upon the embassy. His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires wrote to the Foreign Vice-Ministeroffering to discuss the matter, but the latter declined to receive him. Mr. Hutchi-son was accordingly instructed to point out that the unilateral action of the People&apos;sGovernment was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be inconsistent with article 3 (iii) of the Sino-British Treaty of 1943, which states that &apos;&apos; the Govern-ment of the Republic of China shall accord to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom a continued right to use for official purposes the land whichhas been allocated to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the diplomatic quarter in Peiping on parts of which are located buildings belongingto His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.&quot; Nevertheless the militarycompound was taken over by the Chinese on 11th April. His Majesty&apos;s ChargecT Affaires has expressed the view that this question was, in Chinese eyes,unconnected with the preliminary and procedural discussions upon which theChinese Government insisted. Nevertheless the action taken was obviouslydeliberate, even though the statement published by the China News Agency avoidsany offensive reference and claims that the order to surrender the compoundwas addressed to &quot; the former British Consul,&quot; thus by implication suggesting that the property enjoved no diplomatic immunity. The Ministry for ForeignAffairs also gave His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires to understand that the questionof compensation for the buildings in the military compound would be discussed at a later date. In all the circumstances, and since the voluntary abandonment of the compound had already been contemplated, the action of the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government, though objectionable, does not seem of sufficient importanceto cause us to reconsider our policy.38598 B 2
British business interests9. The position of British business interests has continued to deteriorateparticularly at Shanghai. This has on the one hand been due in many instancesto the Nationalist blockade, which the People&apos;s Government have so far made no attempt to break within their own territorial waters. But it has also been due to thefact that the Communist authorities have imposed heavy taxation and compulsorycontributions to Victory Bonds and have refused to permit the dismissal of laboureven where industries are idle. Though these measures are not in themselvesdiscriminatory, the absence of trade and consequently of income has meant theremittance of large sums from the United Kingdom in order to meet taxation and wages. This has now been going on for many months, and a number ofBritish firms have decided that they must cut their losses and abandon theirenterprises, with the probability that these will sooner or later be expropriated bythe Communist authorities. The total loss of a great proportion of British invest-ment at Shanghai must therefore be faced in the very near future. A cessation of the Nationalist blockade and some readiness on the part of the Communistauthorities to lighten the burden of taxation and wages until trade can be resumedmight postpone the decision, but such alleviation is unlikely. A suggestion thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government might subsidise British interests is considered inPart IV of this paper, but does not commend itself.10. The disappearance at so early a stage of major British interests fromthe China scene is bound adversely to affect our prestige, and to encourage theChinese to hasten the process. It is true that the liquidation of these interestsdoes not necessarily mean the end of all trade between the United Kingdom and china, and there are indications that British trading, as opposed to industrial concerns, may be prepared to continue for some time in the hope of better con-ditions. An indication that the People&apos;s Government intend to continue to buyfrom the Western world is that they are selling gold for foreign exchange. (a recent shipment of one million pounds worth has come under notice because itis to be sold in London; but this may be only because the free market in HongKong is so weak at the moment that it is actually cheaper to acquire Hong Kongdollars by selling gold at the official price in London than on the free market at hong Kong.) Another indication is the fact that two goods trains have recently arrived at Hong Kong from Shanghai and that the Chinese have made a request for the resumption of a through passenger service to Hong Kong. Negotiationsregarding this are in progress. There has been no physical molestation of british nationals and no overt hostility, but on the other hand there has been no cordialityand no readiness to appreciate or to ease the difficulties and handicaps with which british interests are faced. It must be accepted that the Communists areindifferent to the fate of British interests and it may even be that by a simple policyof inaction they are conniving at their liquidation. It is problematical whetherprivate trading interests will survive very long if the full rigour of Communisttheory and practice is applied. If these interests too disappear, such trade as there may be between the United Kingdom and China is likely to be on a Govern-ment-to-Government basis. Indications of this latter trend are already appearing in respect of trade between China and Soviet European satellite countries.Preliminary trade discussions between the &quot;East German Republic&quot; and Chinaapparently took place in Moscow recently, while Polish and Czechoslovak!anTrade Missions have also been reported as going to Peking, presumably as a preliminary to the negotiation of trade agreements.Evacuation of British and other Nationals from Shanghai11. There are some 1,500 foreigners waiting to leave Shanghai. This totalincludes some 400 United Kingdom nationals, some Australians and Canadiansand about 100 Indians. In addition it includes over 240 Americans, mainlyofficials, a small quota of other nationals and about 500 stateless persons. Asa result of the Nationalist blockade, these foreigners have for over six monthsbeen unable to leave by sea and it has not proved possible to make arrangementsfor them to evacuate by air or to leave via other ports.12. Towards the middle of March the United States Government made plans for Withdrawing their nationals on the American President liner General Gordon,which was to proceed to the Yangtse estuary to pick up passengers to be ferriedcloWn from Shanghai on two civilian-manned Landing Stage Transports (L.S.Ts.)-
This plan included facilities for the withdrawal of a considerable number ofBritish nationals. It had, however, to be abandoned because permits could notbe obtained for the operation of the L.S.Ts. as ferrying craft.13. With the failure of this primarily American evacuation project, aBritish operation to get one or more ships to call at the Yangtse estuary and to run a Chinese ferry-boat service was planned. This depended on the use ofthe North Channel of the Yangtse, which had not been mined by the Nationalists.Initial clearance for this project was obtained from the Nationalists. Subse-quently they announced, however, that in view of an imminent Communistoffensive on the Chusan Islands, they would have to mine the North Channelafter 10th April. The Central Peopled Government, for their part, agreed tooive clearance to this operation, but as this was only obtained a day or two before 10th April our naval and shipping authorities in Hong Kong decided tocall the operation off because of the mining risks involved. The abandonment of the enterprise has therefore been due to the Nationalists and not to theChinese People&apos;s Government.14. When the position is somewhat clearer it is intended to renew efforts to enable British nationals to leave, possibly via Tientsin, since the Shanghaiauthorities have recently been authorised by the Central People&apos;s Governmentto grant exit permits via that port. In fact a small number of our nationals arealready leaving and entering via this port.His Majesty&apos;s Consular Establishments15. His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers in China are not recognised by theCentral People&apos;s Government in their official capacity. Official communications are ignored or returned with a statement to the effect that diplomatic relationsbetween the two Governments have not been established. Consular offices havenot, however, been closed and His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers continue to issuepassports and visas and perform notarial functions.16. In their personal capacity His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers have been treated correctly. Similarly in their personal capacity they have on occasion beenable to maintain unofficial and strictly limited contacts with personnel of theChinese Foreign Affairs Department in their district. British nationals andfirms are required to approach the Foreign Affairs Department direct and notthrough His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers when their problems make such an approach necessary.17. As regards communication facilities, the Chinese authorities have sofar clearly discriminated in favour of the Consulates of those Governments whohave accorded recognition. On 20th March the Chinese Government issued anorder to the effect that all foreign nationals must dismantle and hand over withinseven days any wireless equipment used for the transmission or receipt ofmessages. Following on this order all the French and United States wirelesstransmitters at Peking, Nanking, Shanghai, Kunming and Hankow were eithersealed by the authorities or taken over. This order has so far not been appliedto our transmitters. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Shanghai has reportedthat his transmitter is the only foreign set known to be working in Shanghai.18. It is not known whether, if the Chinese People&apos;s Government eventuallyagree to the establishment of normal diplomatic relations, they will also agreeto recognise our Consular establishments in China, and if they do so whetherthey will seek to restrict their number or impose other limitations. If there areno restrictions or limitations, it will be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient to impose any restrictions or limitations upon Chinese Consulates in theUnited Kingdom or dependent territories.Internal Situation19. Though our information is somewhat limited, all that can be gatheredgoes to show that the Central People&apos;s Government, in spite of internal difficulties and apparent lack of spontaneous popularity, is very firmly in the saddle and is increasing its effective control over all spheres of Chinese life. Guerilla activitiesnave been reported from certain areas in the south and west, particularlyiwangtung, Kwangsi and Szechuan, which are recently &quot;liberated&quot; provinces;out these are not of such a nature as to effect the stability of the new Government
in any way. The present famine in the Northern and Central Provinces is undoubtedly grave. For purposes of internal consumption, the Central PeoplesGovernment do not conceal this fact when explaining, the various administrative measures which they are taking in an attempt to deal with it, though for thepurposes of the outside world its seriousness is minimised. So far they have show no indication of seeking assistance through International Relief Organisations,The new regime is also confronted with other serious economic difficulties. Whileit initially met with some success in its pursuit of a deflationary policy by suchforced contributions to victory bonds, &amp;c, in the towns, tax leviesand requisitioning of food-stuffs in rural areas and distribution of the latter in urban areas, the events of the last six months have shown a recrudescence of astrong inflationary trend, especially in commercial centres such as Shanghai. Inaddition, industrial production in the towns has tended to decline and the rural areas, short of commodity goods and heavily taxed, have less incentive to increase their agricultural production. A disturbing factor during the last two months has been the increasing and strong evidence of overt Russian military aid. Thishas taken the form of the supply of jet and other aircraft (so far in small numbers)and probably some crews, anti-aircraft guns, searchlight equipment and possiblytechnicians for training purposes, ground staff, &amp;c. This links up with otherreports of the recent arrival of Russians in and round Shanghai. Reports were received late in 1949 of the arrival of Russians in Northern China, but these were publicised by Chinese Government propaganda as being for the purposeof technical assistance in industrial reconstruction, though it was thought thatthese Russians were also engaged in plans for developing civil aviation. this latter object seems to have been confirmed by the recent Sino-Soviet civil aviationagreement for linking China with the U.S.S.R. by air. A message recently received from Nanking reports the presence of 300 Russian technicians. Itstates that they are engaged in developing the civil air link as well as assistingin the railway reconstruction, in which collaboration has been extensivelypublicised for some time, and also probably giving instruction to the local anti-aircraft units.Chinese Representation in the United Nations20. On 13th January a Soviet resolution in the Security Council to expelthe Chinese Nationalist delegate, Dr. Tsiang, was defeated, and the Sovietdelegate then withdrew, declaring that he would not return until a representativeof the People &apos;s Government had taken over the Chinese seat. The Soviet (andsatellite) boycott has since been extended to all United Nations bodies in session,and continues. In our view the question of Chinese representation is one for a collective, majority decision of the body concerned, and each principal organ of theUnited Nations (General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and social council, Trusteeship Council) as well as each Specialised Agency, is competent to take its own decision. We think it appropriate that the Security Council should give a lead in this matter and hope that the decision will, in the event, be takenfirst in that body. We are, however, prepared to vote in favour of the change-over in any of these bodies as soon as we know that such a decision will command a majority, although on subsidiary bodies we take the line that discussion of thisquestion is out of order and that the decision must first be taken by the appropriateparent body. Five members of the Security Council have now recognised thePeople&apos;s Government and will presumably be prepared to vote in due course forthe change-over (United Kingdom, U.S.S.R., India, Norway, Yugoslavia). two more votes are needed and an approach has been made to Cuba, Ecuador and egypt, although it is unlikely that they will be persuaded to vote in favour unlessFrance or the United States modify their attitude. Our general attitude on thisquestion was outlined to the People&apos;s Government on 17th March (Annex B).Part II.-Analysis of Existing Policy21. The picture of China presented in Part I of this paper is exceedinglydark, and it must be admitted that there are at present no signs of any improve-ment. The question which presents itself therefore is whether the policy of His- Majesty&apos;s Government in according de jure recognition to the Chinese PeopledGovernment and entering into diplomatic relations with that Government hasbeen justified or whether it is desirable now to revise that policy to the extent of
breaking, off such relations. The act of recognition was based on the facts ofthe situation in China, which were such as to require recognition according tothe standards of international law and practice. This cannot be undone. the entry, however, into diplomatic relations is a pure matter of policy and can be revoked if so wished or required.22. The de jure recognition of the Chinese People&apos;s Government by HisMajesty&apos;s Government was taken with full knowledge of the position, and therewas&apos;no undue optimism about future prospects. In CP. (49) 214 of 24th October1949, it was stated that &quot; it would be a mistake to disregard the fact that they[the People&apos;s Government] are, on their own statements, orthodox Marxist-Leninists who openly declare their strong partiality for the Soviet Union andits methods.&quot; In CP. (49) 248 of 12th December, 1949, it was recognised thatthe Chinese People&apos;s Government might not regard the international obligations of its predecessors as binding and that &quot;we should have no illusions in thisrespect.&quot; It was expected that Chinese propaganda would continue its attacks on&quot; Western imperialism &quot; and follow the Moscow pattern. These excerpts areenough to show that the approach to the problem of recognition was entirelyrealistic, nor was there any suggestion that substantial advantages would flow from recognition.23. While the hope that recognition might enable us to afford some measureof protection to our trading interests has not so far been fulfilled, the fundamentalpolitical reason for according recognition was that to withhold it would imply a deliberate policy of boycotting China. The domination of China by a Com-munist regime is repugnant to the Western powers, but it is nevertheless a fact which cannot and should not be ignored. Here we have a vast country containingnearly a quarter of the population of the world, ruled for the time being by aGovernment in alliance with Moscow. To boycott it would certainly strengthen the ties between Moscow and Peking; to attempt to create a sanitary cordonaround it is beyond the powers of either the United States or the United Kingdom.The present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is therefore to try to maintaincontacts with China, for the reason that in the maintenance of contacts with theWest lies the only hope of influencing China not to commit herself finally andirrevocably to the Kremlin. If this course is pursued, it will be a hard one fromwhich we must expect to derive no early or material benefits. But the stake isa big one, since the alternative would be to write China off as irretrievably lost to Western democracy and to invite her open hostility. Such an alternative can-not readily be accepted in the case of a country which, for better or for worse,cannot fail to have a profound influence both politically and economically, as wellas strategically, upon the geographical area in which it is situated. It is onlynecessary to mention our position in Hong Kong, the large overseas Chinesepopulations in Malaya and elsewhere in South-East Asia, and the necessity for japan to trade with China if she is to achieve economic viability. As regardsoverseas Chinese communities, my colleagues may agree that officials should becalled upon to furnish a report on their position, not only in British territories,but also in South-East Asia generally, as a result of recent developments inChina.24. It is of course possible that the Chinese People&apos;s Government will ultimately decline to establish normal diplomatic relations and that we shall be forced into the position of breaking off relations. But it is of importance thatif there is a break, we should be demonstrably able to place the responsibilitybefore the world fairly upon the Chinese Government. In that event it should be far easier to rally on our side world opinion, and particularly public opinion bothin South-East Asia and in India, Pakistan and Ceylon, which will be of con-siderable value if we are forced by the Chinese into the position of accepting thealternative indicated in the preceding paragraph. Conversely, if we can be heldin any way to be responsible for a break, this will be exploited in order to alienateAsi an opinion from us, and we shall be correspondingly in a weaker position tomeet the menace with which we should then be confronted.25. As long as the Chinese People&apos;s Government can enjoy the prestige of past successes and add to them, it must be expected that they will have a consider-aWe and adverse psychological effect upon the peoples of the Far East and South-East Asia.   For the present it can only be a matter of conjecture whether they will
be able to maintain their position or not, but it is conceivable that the situation may develop in one of the following ways :-(a) that in order to sustain their position, the People&apos;s Government will turnmore and more to Russia for help, with the eventual result that Chinacomes under complete Russian domination. Against this there is thenatural Chinese xenophobia;(&amp;) that Titoism will develop as a result of Russian attempts to dominate thePeople&apos;s Government. There are as yet no signs of such attemptsbeing made;(c) that the People&apos;s Government will fail, like their predecessors, to maintaineffective control over the country as a whole, and that dissident elements in consequence are eventually able to overthrow them. While thePeople&apos;s Government have become heirs to both famine and inflation and while there is some disillusionment, there is as yet no evidence ofdissident elements sufficiently strong to challenge them or of anyleaders likely to inspire general confidence;(d) that the People&apos;s Government will by their own efforts achieve an unqualified success which will enable them to make China a Great Powerstanding on her own feet. The odds against this at present appear tobe considerable.Clearly it will take time for the situation to develop in any one of these directions.Equally clearly it will not be possible for the Western Powers to take advantageof or to exploit any favourable developments or to counter adverse tendencies ifthey have no relations or contacts with China.26. It does seem, therefore, that however dark the immediate prospect maybe, the policy which we have pursued of entering into diplomatic relations with theChinese People&apos;s Government is the correct one. Apart from the fact that itwould be very difficult to break off relations at this stage, the consequences of adecision to do so would certainly be adverse. We should gain no particular credit: from the United States, who have asked us to look after their interests, and whom it may well suit to have a friend with a foot in what they regard as virtually anenemy camp. We should be reproached by India, Pakistan and Ceylon and by foreign Governments who followed our example. Other Commonwealth represen-tatives at Colombo accepted the fact that recognition of the People&apos;s Governmentwas inevitable sooner or later, though they have since shown no definite intentionof according this; while the French have only been deterred from following ourexample by the inopportune recognition of Ho Chi Minh by China. Thus ourposition with our friends would be in no way improved were we now to take theinitiative in breaking off the relations we have sought to establish. On the otherhand, we should undoubtedly provoke the hostility of the People&apos;s Government.Since the future of our trading interests is in any case doubtful, their early and total loss might make a difference only in time. But the effect of a breach upon our position in Hong Kong and South-East Asia might be more far-reaching, and though we should be relieved of the necessity of considering Chinese susceptibilites-bilities, the prospect of a conflict with China would loom nearer in the minds oflocal populations and might have a corresponding effect upon their morale, which even now is not high. The pressure from Chinese Communism would increaseboth overtly and covertly, and with our limited resources we should be hard put to it to hold our position against any considerable intensification of that pressure.Part III. The United States and China27. If it is agreed that we should pursue our present course, even thoughit is a hard one, and that if there is to be a break in our relations it should be caused by China, the question arises to what degree we can count upon the supportof other friendly Powers, and in particular the United States. As regards theCommonwealth and friendly European Powers, while certain of them have notfollowed our example, none has actually opposed our policy. The United states administration for their part have remained consistently friendly and under-standing.   Just before His Majesty&apos;s Government announced recognition of the
Chinese People&apos;s Government Republican elements in Congress were pressing foractive assistance to Formosa. At a most opportune moment Mr. Acheson and president Truman issued statements which undoubtedly helped greatly to minimiseany adverse effects which our act of recognition might have had on american public opinion.28. At the same time the State Department have found themselves in con-siderable difficulty because certain Republicans have picked upon China as theweak link in the Administration^ policy. That policy was originally laid downby the late President Roosevelt. As it has proved to be a failure about whichAmerican public opinion remains particularly sensitive, there has been an attemptto label it as a policy of the Democratic Party which is legitimately a target for attack. In a year in which elections are to take place, the Administration hashad to act with extreme caution, the net result of which has been that there is infact no United States policy towards China at all beyond &quot; waiting for the dustto settle.&quot;   This negative line is in itself the subject of attack.29. Though Mr. Acheson and the State Department have appreciated our reasons for recognising the Chinese People&apos;s Government they have not felt ableto follow suit. The American emotional reaction to the treatment of the UnitedStates Consul-General at Mukden, to the continued detention of two Americanairmen who disobeyed orders and made a forced landing in Communist territory,and finally to the seizure of the American barracks in Peking in January, forcedthe State Department to order the withdrawal of all its officials from China(though many have not yet been able to leave). The State Department have alsofelt compelled for internal political reasons to take a strong line with us aboutthe aircraft at Hong Kong (see paragraph 7), even though the situation whichhas been created there arises from the failure of the American interests in thetwo aviation companies to respond to the Governors request to remove the aircraftbefore their ownership could become an issue. These interests were thus respon-sible for the present situation in which a considerable body of Communists have access to our only airfield at Hong Kong.30. This is not the only instance where action by the United States or its nationals has been to the detriment of our common interest. To some extent itcan be said that several adverse factors in the present situation in China areattributable, not so much to any conscious policy on the part of the United States(since, as has been said, there is no clear policy) but to United States military aid to the Nationalists on the one hand and the actions of the Administration inantagonising the Chinese People&apos;s Government on the other. As to the first,though there is no direct evidence that American military aid is officially being continued, there is reason to suppose that the residue of war material alreadyordered continues to be delivered. The Chinese People&apos;s Government has notignored the fact that Chinese ports are bombed by American aircraft with american bombs, while warships acquired from the Americans lay what are pre-sumably American mines in the Yangtse. While hostilities continued between the nationalists and the Communists on the mainland, it was both interesting andsignificant that the latter possessed no air-force capable of influencing the decision.In the last few weeks, however, it has become clear that they are now possessed of an air-force, which they must have obtained from the Russians (though we donot know what price they had to pay). Russian personnel have also appeared in shanghai and other places. The scale of Russian assistance cannot yet be accur-ately estimated, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the provision of this assistance is the natural outcome of American assistance to the Nationalists inFormosa.31. As regards the United States attitude towards the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment, there has without question been considerable provocation from thelatter. But as early as 30th July, 1949, when this provocation was in no wayserious, Mr. Acheson, in his letter of transmittal to the President of the AmericanWhite Paper on China, stated that the attitude of the United States &apos;&apos; will necessarily be influenced by the degree to which the Chinese people come to recog-nise that the Communist regime serves not their interests but those of SovietRussia,&quot; and that the United States &quot;should encourage all developments in China which now and in the future work towards &quot; throwing off the foreign38598 c
yoke. Though for our part we should concur in these views, their appearance inan official document which received world-wide publicity can hardly have failedto indicate the hostility of the United States to the Government then about toassume power in China. Similarly, soon after Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-laihad returned from Moscow after concluding a treaty and agreements which, atany rate in their published texts, demonstrated the complete equality between theSoviet Union and China, Mr. Acheson, in an otherwise admirable speech deliveredat San Francisco on 15th March, 1950, lectured China on the way in which she should conduct herself. The contrast can only have the effect of embittering theChinese towards the United States and of encouraging them even more to look to the Soviet Union. To the extent that the United Kingdom is undeniablyassociated with the United States in its opposition to Russian imperialism aniiwe have agreed to take charge of American interests in China there can hardly fail to be an adverse reaction upon our own relations with the Chinese PeopledGovernment. Indeed it is conceivable that this has been one of the main reasonsfor their delay in consenting to establish normal diplomatic relations with theUnited Kingdom. It must be supposed that the Russians are using all their influence to persuade the Chinese that as we are hand-in-glove with the Americansthey should have nothing to do with us.32. The inconsistency of the United States attitude towards the formerNationalist Government of China, which again is due to internal politics,constitutes a further unsettling factor in the situation. In transmitting the white paper on China in July last Mr. Acheson referred to intervention &quot;on behalfof a Government which had lost the confidence of its own troops and its own people.&quot; In his San Francisco speech of 15th March Mr. Acheson said : &quot; TheNationalist Government in China was overthrown in China not by force of arms.It collapsed from its own inherent weakness and the withdrawal of the people&apos;ssupport.&quot; Nevertheless the United States continue to recognise that Governmenteven though it has taken refuge in Formosa, which is not yet legally restored to china. The Chinese People&apos;s Government naturally regard the United States asopenly aiding and abetting their enemies and providing them with the means of attacking the mainland.33. While the present attitude of the United States continues it will bedifficult to find a solution to the China problem in the United Nations. If theUnited States were prepared to indicate to France, Egypt, Ecuador and Cubatheir readiness to accept a representative of the Chinese People&apos;s Government inthe Security Council, even though they would not feel able to vote for him, itis not improbable that these Powers might be prepared to take the plunge andthus furnish at any rate the two additional votes required. So far the UnitedStates have not gone beyond saying that they would accept a majority decision,which has not been sufficient to remove the doubts of the four Powers concerned.The deadlock thus remains unresolved, which is unsatisfactory, since in essenceit is the dislike of the ideology of the Chinese People&apos;s Government and not anymore substantial reason which governs the attitude of the United States, whoseinfluence is causing other Powers to adopt a negative attitude.34. A further instance of the adverse effect upon the situation of UnitedStates inconsistency towards the Chinese Nationalists is in relation to the blockade of Shanghai, which, as already indicated, is a main contributory cause of the virtual breakdown of our trading position there. Though the United Statesconsiders this action illegal, they have been unwilling to do anything to bring it to an end, and have left the Communists in the belief that the blockade is beingcarried out with American approval and connivance. One consequence has beenthe state to which British firms have been reduced. Another and possibly more serious consequence has been the invoking of Russian assistance by the communists. It may be that the blockade will before long be broken as a resultof that assistance, but the appearance of Russians so far south is something which both we and the United States should have wished to avoid, and the results of thisintervention, which is attributable in some degree to the inaction of the UnitedStates over the blockade on the one hand and to their action on the other in makingmilitary aid available to the Nationalists, may be far-reaching.35. It is not to be expected, for the reasons already stated, that the UnitedStates Administration will feel able to change their attitude overnight.    The
preceding paragraphs indicate the difficulty and at the same time the desirabilityof coming to some kind of understanding with the United States over China.The opportunity will occur in the course of my forthcoming talks withMr. Acheson.  My recommendations will be found in Part IV of this paper.Part IV. Conclusions and Recommendations36. I have felt it necessary to give in some detail an account of the presentposition in China, an analysis of our position and of the attitude of the UnitedStates. The conclusion would seem to be that the policy which we have pursuedis one which, despite hardships, we should continue and that we should make every effort to bring the United States into line with that policy, at any rate tothe extent that internal political considerations permit.37. It remains to be considered whether there is anything which can bedone by our own efforts to alleviate the position of our interests in China. Asregards the blockade of Shanghai, the Law Officers have expressed the view thatwe should not intervene in the civil war by interfering with Nationalist warships.I should not in any event feel justified in recommending any measures to deal withthe blockade until I have had an opportunity of discussing this aspect of the china situation with the United States Government.38. Since besides the blockade the burden of taxation and wages is the othermain cause of the imminent collapse of British business interests, it is for con-sideration whether anything can be done to relieve this burden. The Chairman ofthe China Association recently made a suggestion to the Treasury that HisMajesty&apos;s Government might finance with suitable mortgages any key british companies which were unable to carry on because of the dissipation of their reserves. Though the sum mentioned initially was some  300,000, it has sincebecome clear that any subvention of the kind suggested would more probablybe in the neighbourhood of  1 million. After discussions between the ForeignOffice, the Treasury and the Board of Trade, the conclusion was reached that sucha subvention could only be justified on political grounds, and that it would therefore have to be sponsored by the Foreign Office and borne on the ForeignOffice vote. I would be prepared to recommend such a course were it not for thefact that, though we should be assisting British firms, we would in a sense befinancing public utilities in a Communist State without any guarantee that that state will not eventually expropriate the particular utilities concerned. It wouldbe difficult to justify such action in Parliament, and the action might serve onlyto encourage the Communist authorities to continue their pressure on Britishinterests.39. It is unlikely that the Chinese Government will respond to representa-tions in any effective degree until normal relations are established, and it is not known when that will be. Attempts to discuss substantive issues with the ChineseGovernment at this stage may further complicate the problem of establishingnormal relations. Nevertheless, 1 consider that inaction would expose HisMajesty&apos;s Government to justifiable criticism, and that since the matter is sourgent His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires should be instructed to make earlyrepresentations to the Chinese Government about the plight of the Britisheconomic interests in China.40. It is clear from paragraphs 37 and 38 above that there are no othersteps which can be taken at present to alleviate the position of United Kingdomcommercial and industrial interests in China. We should, however, explore theblockade position with the United States and do what we can with the Chineseauthorities as opportunity offers to try to bring about an improvement in condi-tions. If British firms nevertheless decide to close down, we should not deter them,but should advise them when closing down not to take any action which willprejudice their chances of obtaining at any rate some measure of compensation from the Chinese authorities. We should facilitate to the extent open to us theevacuation of British subjects who wish to leave.38598 c 2
Recommendations41.   I invite my colleagues to agree to the following recommendations : (a) That we should continue our present policy towards China.(b) That I should discuss with the United States Secretary of State the wholefield of the relations of both our Governments with China on the basisof this paper and seek to ensure that the United States do not adoptcourses which are harmful to our common ultimate aim of preventing the permanent alienation of China from the West.(c) That I should try to persuade the United States Government to modify their attitude towards Chinese representation in the United nations to the extent of signifying to the four Powers represented in theSecurity Council their willingness to accept a change, even though theythey do not feel able to vote for it.(d) That British firms should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s government feel unable to give financial assistance, but will do what they can tohelp in any other way open to them.(e) That His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking should be instructedto make representations to the Chinese Government about the positionof British economic interests in China.E.

ANNEX ACommunications on Recognition exchanged between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Central People&apos;s Government of Chtna(i) Note communicated to the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs by HisMajesty&apos;&apos;s Consul-General at Peking on 6th January, 1950&quot;Sir,I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, having completed their study of the situation resulting from the formation of the Central PeopledGovernment of the People&apos;s Republic of China and observing that it is now ineffective control of by far the greater part of the territory of China, have this dayrecognised that Government as the de jure Government of China. In thesecircumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government, in response to Chairman Mao Tse-tung&apos;s proclamation of 1st October, 1949, are ready to establish diplomatic relations on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty and are prepared to exchange diplomatic representatives withthe Central People&apos;s Government.2. Pending the appointment of an Ambassador, Mr. J. C. Hutchison hasbeen nominated as His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires ad interim. Accordingly,I have the honour to request that you will receive him and transact official business with him in that capacity, and further that he may be granted all necessary facilities for the transfer of himself, his staff and the archives of His Majesty&apos;s embassy from Nanking to Peking.ERNEST BEVIN,His Britannic Majesty,s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.&quot;(ii) Reply to (i) signed by the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs and delivered to His Majesty &apos;s Consul-General at Peking on 9th January, 1950&quot; On behalf of the Central Peoples Government of the Peoples Republic ofChina, I hereby acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of 6th January, 1950,transmitting the information that the Government of the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland is ready to establish diplomatic relationswith the Central People&apos;s Government of the People &apos;s Republic of China on thebasis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty.I hereby inform you that the Central People&apos;s Government of the People&apos;republic of China is willing to establish diplomatic relations with your Govern-ment on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for the territory and sovereignty, and accept Mr. J. C. Hutchison, whom you have appointed asCharge d&apos;Affaires ad interim, as the representative of the Government of theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland sent to Peking to carryon negotiations on the question of establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries. The Central People&apos;s Government of the People&apos;s republic of China will give all necessary facilities for the transfer of Mr. Hutchison, his staff and archives from Nanking to Peking.CHOU EN-LAI,&quot;
ANNEX BExchanges between the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs at peking and His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires on preliminary andprocedural questions regarding establishment of diplomatic relations(i) Oral Communication made by Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires on 3rd March, 1950&quot; Of questions concerning establishment of diplomatic relations betweenChina and the United Kingdom, the most important, which must be settled first,is question of severance of relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government andKuomintang remnant of reactionaries.   The Chinese Government consider, asHis Majesty&apos;s Government has announced the establishment of diplomatic rela-tions with the Chinese People&apos;s Republic, it should not continue to maintain anydiplomatic intercourse with Kuomintang.    The British delegate to security council, however, on 10th January concurred with the American delegatedopinion that a decision to take action as proposed by Soviet delegate would be premature and when Soviet delegated proposal was put to a vote on 13th january the British delegate abstained.   This action in effect means that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment continues to recognise the legality of so-called &quot;delegate&quot; ofKuomintang remnant of reactionary clique and refuses to accept delegate of legal Government of Chinese people.   Similar action was subsequently taken byBritish delegates in other organisations of United Nations, e.g., the Economicand Social Council.   The Chinese therefore consider His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould clarifjr their attitude to this question and demonstrate by actual deedstheir complete severance of diplomatic intercourse with Kuomintang remnantreactionaries and their sincerity in desiring to establish diplomatic relations withChinese People&apos;s Republic.  The Central People&apos;s Government consider that thisquestion is one the practical settlement of which is essential for the establishmentof diplomatic relations between China and United Kingdom.   Furthermore theChinese Government hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will inform themclearly of their attitude to various organisations of Kuomintang remnant cliqueat present in Hong Kong and to all Chinese nationals&apos; property there.&quot;At this interview the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs said they hopedthat His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires would be able to make an early statementof the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on both these questions and furtheradded the hope that he would see him again soon. His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Affaires described the tone of the meeting as courteous and friendly.(ii) Oral Communication made by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d:Affaires on 17th Marchin reply to questions raised by the Central People&apos;s Government at his interview on 3rd March with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign A ffain&quot; As already indicated to the People&apos;s Government, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom withdrew recognition from the former nationalist government of China on 6th January, 1950, on which day they notified de jure recognition of the People&apos;s Government. No diplomatic relations have existedwith the former Nationalist Government since that date. The Chinese embassy in London is closed and the former Ambassador enjoys no diplomatic status.The present position in the United Nations has, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, no connexion with the facts of the positionas already stated. A decision as to whether the former Nationalist representatives should be expelled from their seats in the various organs of the United Nationscan only be reached collectively and the effect of the action that has beenprematurely taken to seek a decision by vote has furnished concrete evidence thatthis course does not produce the desired result. Our experience since the settingup of the United Nations has proved to us that collective decisions in the desireddirection are brought about by consultation, and not by publicly registering a vote in opposition to the majority. When His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom abstained from voting in the Security Council on the issue of the
expulsion of the former Nationalist representative, this did not constitute an expression of view in favour of the former Nationalist representative or againstthe People&apos;s Government representative. The decision to abstain was takenbecause there was at that time no likelihood of a majority decision and it wasconsequently premature for the question to be raised. The considerations which applied in the Security Council apply equally in other organs of the Unitedjfations. In general His Majesty&apos;s Government would, of course, welcome theappearance of representatives of the People&apos;s Government in all organs of theUnited Nations as soon as the majority of members of those organs are disposed to vote in favour of that Govermenfs admission. They will themselves vote infavour of such admission as soon as they are assured that the taking of a votewill not simply result in the rejection of the People&apos;s Government&apos;s candidates.The stay in Hong Kong of individual Chinese who may have held positions of responsibility in organisations connected with the former Kuomintang Govern-ment or been members of the Kuomintang does not mean that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise them as representatives of the Kuomintang or as having any political status at all. They are given asylum in Hong Kong subject to good behaviour; this being ordinarily accorded in international practice.Furthermore, the Hong Kong Societies Ordinance of 1949 makes registration of all Societies compulsory and expressly prevents the registration of all societies and Organisations which are affiliated with political parties abroad. Thus theoperation in Hong Kong of these Societies and Organisations which cannot be registered is rendered illegal. While individual membership of foreign political parties is still permitted, group activities are thus banned.As regards Chinese national property, the recognition by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the Central People&apos;s Government produces in British law (usingthis term as a comprehensive expression to cover both the United Kingdom and hong Kong and other colonies) the effect that the right to exercise control overChinese State property now falls to the Central People&apos;s Government. If, however,the Central People&apos;s Government cannot obtain actual possession and control ofany such property because other persons are holding it and refuse to give it upon demand, the executive cannot settle such disputes, and it will be necessaryfor the Central People&apos;s Government to have recourse to the Courts/&apos;ANNEX C(i) Memorandum on the subject of the sabotage of Chinese civil aircraft at HongKong communicated to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Peking onAth A pril, 1950&quot; The Hong Kong Government should bear the full responsibility for the incident in which seven civil aircraft belonging to China were wrecked by bombs in the Hong Kong Government military prohibited area, for the guarding of which british police were responsible.Since the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Central People&apos;s Government on13th January, 1950, ordered Liu Ching-yi, General Manager of the ChinaNational Aviation Corporation, and Chen Cho-lin, General Manager of theCentral Air Transport Corporation to Hong Kong, to take over the property ofthe two air corporations, the Hong Kong Government has on the one handimpeded Chinese civil aircraft from taking off from China, while on the otherhand it has not, in a fully responsible manner, protected the aircraft lying in the hong Kong military prohibited area, and has thus rendered possible the commis-sion of the present acts of sabotage.Therefore the Hong Kong Government should bear the full and direct responsibility for the present losses incurred by China and should immediatelyhand over for disposal all the property of the C.N.A.C. and the C.A.T.C. in Hong-Kong to the personnel delegated by the Civil Aviation Bureau of the central people&apos;s Government. During the period when the planes and all the propertyof the two corporations are still in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government must still bear full responsibility for their protection.The Central People&apos;s Government reserve all rights of raising questionselating to the responsibility for this sabotage incident.&quot;
(ii) Reply to (i) to be communicated by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to accept contention that the Gov-ernment of Hong Kong afforded inadequate protection to these aircraft. Personsin possession acknowledge their primary responsibility and still maintain that position.  Police precautions were adequate at all times.The only persons who have had access to these aircraft are :  (i) Employees of C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C. who have stated that they Erenowin the employment of Central People&apos;s Government.(ii) Employees of maintenance and oil companies employed by the two companies.(iii) Members of police force and senior personnel of Department of CivilAviation, in the course of their duties.No precautions short of complete exclusion of all C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C.personnel from airfield could have prevented incident. Sixteen employees ofC.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C. were detained for questioning and police enquiry is stillin progress.   His Majesty&apos;s Government do not therefore accept responsibility.&quot;
