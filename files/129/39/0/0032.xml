Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1950SECRET Copy No.   4CP. (50) 822Qth April, 1950CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPE : THIRD SESSION OF COMMITTEE OFMINISTERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs submit herewith, for the information of my colleagues, an account of theThird Session of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, held inStrasbourg from 30th March to 1st April, 1950.2. The meeting was preceded by a short meeting of official advisers. TheStanding Committee of the Consultative Assembly met from 31st March to 1st April; and representatives of the Committee of Ministers and the StandingCommittee had an informal discussion on the evening of 31st March. The fullagenda of the Committee of Ministers will be found at Annex A of the appendix to this Paper, and the conclusions reached are set out in detail in the Appendixitself.3.   The principal decisions taken fall into three categories : I. New AdmissionsIt was decided to address, through the Allied High Commissionand the French Government respectively, invitations to the german federal Republic and the Saar to become Associate Members of theCouncil.IT- Constitutional problems the Committee considered the question of relations between theCommittee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly.It was agreed that an informal meeting should be held between four members of the Committee of Ministers and five representatives of theStanding Committee of the Assembly, including the Chairman,M. Spaak. The representatives of the Committee of Ministers and theStanding Committee who attended this meeting agreed to meet again inLondon in the middle of May and discuss the problem further.III. Relations with O.E.E.C. and O.E.E.C. Comments &apos;on the EconomicRecommendations of the assembly the Committee of Ministers decided :  (a) To discuss with the Council of O.E.E.C. arrangements wherebyeconomic and financial proposals originating in the Con-consultative Assembly or its Committees might be examined byO.E.E.C. and reported on by them to the Committee ofMinisters.(&amp;) To set up under the chairmanship of the Turkish ambassador in Paris a Sub-Committee to consider the whole problem ofexchanges of information between the two bodies.The Committee also agreed to transmit the comments of O.E.E.C. to the consultative Assembly, adding certain comments of their own.38628 r
4. The Committee of Ministers took positive action on only one point on theagenda, the admission of the German Federal Republic and the Saar. The other decisions consisted essentially in referring questions for further examination.Nevertheless the results of the meeting can in general be regarded as satisfactory.The Committee of Ministers, under the chairmanship of M. Schuman, who was much more businesslike than his predecessor, the Danish Foreign Minister, dealtwith a heavy agenda quickly and on the whole harmoniously. There were nodifferences on major points of principle, such opposition as there was comingmainly from Mr. McBride, the representative of the Irish Republic, who at timesappeared to be arguing for argument&apos;s sake. When brought to the point,however, he did not in any instance venture to force a vote which would no doubt have left him in a minority of one, and in the event all decisions were takenunanimously.5. Apart from the decision to offer associate membership to the german federal Republic and the Saar, probably the most significant feature of themeeting was the notable improvement in relations between the Committee ofMinisters and the Assembly as represented by the Standing Committee. already at the meeting of the General Affairs Committee on 21st March there was evidenceof a more accommodating spirit. The Standing Committee showed a genuinedesire to co-operate with the Ministers, and the informal meeting held on31st March was extremely friendly in tone. The acrimony which marked the meetings last November was altogether lacking.6. The experiment of arranging for the meetings of the two committees to coincide and of holding informal contacts between the two may thus be held to have justified itself. The problem of finding a modus vivendi between theCommittee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly is the fundamentalconstitutional difficulty which must be solved before the Council can become an effective instrument of European co-operation. So far, the Committee of ministers and the Standing Committee have done no more than agree to examine the problem;and there is no doubt that, even though extreme federalist ideas are losing ground in the Assembly, there will be serious divergences of opinion once the discussionof points of substance begins. Nevertheless, the relationship established is a notable advance on that which existed at previous meetings, and the realisticand conciliatory attitude adopted by the Standing Committee gives reason to hopethat progress made be made in London next month.E.

A dmission of Germany and the SaarThe Committee decided to address, through the Allied High Commission andthe French Government respectively, invitations to the German Federal republic and the Saar to become associate members of the Council of Europe in accordancewith Article 5 of the Statute. It was agreed that (mutatis mutandis) the lettersshould be identic, and should impose no conditions other than had been acceptedby the present members of the Council. In particular, admission to the council should not be made conditional on a favourable vote in the Parliaments of thetwo countries.The text of the letters addressed to the Allied High Commission and dr. Adenauer are attached at Annex B.
II. Constitutional QuestionsItem 3 (a). Relations bettveen the Committee of Ministers and the Consultative.A ssemblyThe Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution (text at Annex C) in whichthey nominated the Foreign Ministers of France. Italy, Norway and the UnitedKingdom to establish contact with the Standing Committee of the consultative assembly with a view to determining how best the Committee of Ministers andthe Consultative Assembly might co-operate in the interests of the Council ofEurope. The resolution further requested the four Ministers to set up, inconjunction with the Standing Committee, a Committee which would study theproblem and report in due course.An informal meeting was held on 31st March between Messrs. Shuman,Sforza, Lange and Bevin on the one hand, and MM. Spaak, Drossos, Jacini,Mullet and Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, on the other, at which it was decided to holda further meeting in London in the middle of May, when the problem of relationsbetween the two organs of the Council would be further discussed.Item 3 (b). Question of substitutes for members of the Assembly (Article 25 (c)of the Statute)At their first session, the Consultative Assembly recommended (1) that the system of substitutes be abolished; and(2) that the number of representatives in the Consultative Assembly bedoubled.These recommendations were considered by the Committee of Ministers attheir first meeting in Paris in November. The Committee agreed that the systemof substitutes had not given satisfaction. Since, however, the abolition of sub-stitutes might cause difficulties for the smaller States, the Committee decided torefer the question to a Committee to be appointed by the Ministers. The resultsof this enquiry would be sent to the Standing Committee for their views.Subsequently, at a meeting held in Strasbourg on 28th January, the bureau of the Assembly expressed the view that since the abolition of the system of substitutes would involve an amendment of the Statute, it would be impossibleto take any effective action on the Assembly&apos;s recommendation before the next session of the Consultative Assembly.In view of the opinion expressed by the Bureau, the Committee of ministers decided to postpone examination of this question until their next session.III. Relations with O.E.E.C. and Comments by O.E.E.C. on the Consul -tative Assembly&apos;s Economic RecommendationsItem 4. Relations between the Council of Europe and O.E.E.C.The Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution (text at Annex D)deciding:  (1) To discuss with the Council of O.E.E.C. arrangements whereby economicand financial proposals originating in the Assembly or its Committees,and transmitted by the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers tothe Council of O.E.E.C., might be examined by O.E.E.C. and reported on to the Committee of Ministers;(2) to set up, under the Chairmanship of the Turkish Ambassador in Paris,a Sub-Committee to consider, in consultation with O.E.E.C., theproblem of exchanges of information between the two bodies.Item- 5. O.E.E.C. Comments on the Economic Recommendations of the assembly the Committee of Ministers had before them the comments of O.E.E.C. on the.Assembly&apos;s recommendations.   The text of the recommendations, together withthe O.E.E.C.&apos;s comments, is attached at Annex E.38628
The Committee of Ministers decided to transmit the O.E.E.C. comments tothe Consultative Assembly, adding the following comments of their own (full textat Annex F) : (1) It was apparent from the O.E.E.C.&apos;s reply that the problems dealt within the Assembly&apos;s recommendations Nos. 2, 3, 5 (a multilateral systemof payments, consultation on credit policy, and industrial conferenceson productivity) were already under examination and in process ofsolution by O.E.E.C.(2) As regards recommendation No. 1 (intensification of the spread ofeconomic information) the Committee of Ministers instructed theSecretary-General of the Council to establish contact with O.E.E.C.,with a view to initiating the necessary publicity.(3) As regards the Assembly&apos;s recommendation No. 6 (draft EuropeanConvention for the control of international cartels) the Committee ofMinisters declared their intention of establishing contact with thePreparatory Commission of the International Trade Organisation witha view to the examination of this problem in so far as it concernedEurope.(4) With regard to recommendation No. 4 (European Economic Conference)the Committee of Ministers considered that the time for such aconference had not yet come.IV. Cultural and Social Questions : Human RightsItem 6. Cultural Questions. Secretary-General&apos;s ReportThe Consultative Assembly, at their first session, adopted a series ofcultural recommendations (for full text see Annex V to Appendix &quot;A&quot; of the&quot; Report on the Proceedings of the First Session of the Council of Europe &quot;(Cmd. 7808).   The main points of these recommendations were as follows : : (a) To establish a system of cultural conventions between Member States;(b) to promote free circulation and exchange between. Member States of books,papers, works of art and documentary films;(c) to consider close collaboration, and the pooling of material and man-power,in scientific research and technical development;(d) to provide for aid to private organisations working to promote Europeanculture;(e) to invite Ministers of Education of Member States to meet and draw upa European plan for cultural co-operation for submission to theAssembly;(/) to invite the responsible authorities of Universities to meet;(g) to institute a European Cultural Centre.At their meeting in November the Committee of Ministers decided to adopt(a) to instruct the Secretary-General to report on (b) (c) and (d), and to consider(e), (/) and (g) at their next meeting.The Committee of Ministers had before them the report which the Secretary-General had been instructed to prepare on points (b) (c) and (d). The decisions taken were as follows : Point (b). Free circulation of cultural materialThe Conunittee decided to request Member States to support, as far aspossible, the action being taken by UNESCO and to impress their Delegationsattending the 5th General Conference of UNESCO at Florence in May 1950 withthe importance which the Consultative Assembly attaches to a suitable agreement in the matter being adopted at that Conference.Point (c). Closer collaboration and pooling of materials and man-power inscientific research and technical development.The Committee of Ministers expressed their appreciation of the measuresinitiated by O.E.E.C. which they considered, in practice, met the wishes of theAssembly. They further requested that they should be kept informed of develop-,ments in order that they might themselves inform the forthcoming session of the consultative Assembly.
Point (d). -Aid to Private Organisations working to promote European CtdtureThe Committee of Ministers decided to request the Consultative Assembly toelucidate the meaning of this recommendation.Points (e), (/) and (g) were referred for examination to a Committee of govermental experts.Item 7-Social questions Brussels Treaty Social Security Convention Repre-sentation of Council of Europe at I.L.O. Conference on MigrationThe Committee had before them a suggestion by the Belgian Governmentthat the Multilateral Social Security Convention signed by the Brussels treaty powers on 7th November, 1949, should be extended to Member States of the Councilof Europe.It was decided to refer this question to a Committee of official experts.Participation of Council of Europe in I.L.O. Preparatory  Conference  onMigrationIt was agreed that the Secretary-General should send an official of the secretariat to attend this Conference as an observer.Item 8. Human rights the Committee had before them the report of the Committee of Experts on adraft Human Rights Convention. As this, however, had only been received by ministers a few days before the opening of the session of the Committee it wasnot possible to discuss the substance of the report.It was agreed that the point had now been reached at which the politicalproblem involved had to be defined and decisions taken by the Committee ofMinisters. The Committee accordingly decided to call a meeting of government officials early in June, with a view to arriving at an agreed settlement of political issues, and preparing the ground for the decisions to be taken by the Ministers.It should be noted that this meeting of experts, and those mentioned in thepreceding sections dealing with cultural questions and social security, representthe first attempt to develop the &quot; Brussels&quot; technique of inter-governmentalcollaboration in the field of the Council of Europe.V. Financial and Administrative Questions Any Other BusinessItems 9 and 12. Date and place of next Meeting of the Committee of MinistersIt was decided that the sessions of the Committee of Ministers and Consul-tative Assembly should begin on 3rd August and 7th August respectively.Item 10.-Finances of the Secretariat-GeneralVarious administrative decisions were taken under this heading, the mostimportant being : (1) to authorise the Secretary-General to transfer credits in the 1949 budget,amounting to 17,500,000 fr. in all, from certain headings to others.The reason for these transfers, which under the Councils FinancialRegulations have to be approved by the Committee of Ministers, wasthat the credits tentatively allowed to certain items (e.g. salaries) forthe first few months of the Council&apos;s working were too large, whereasothers (e.g., expenses of the Consultative Assembly) were insufficient;(2) to spend an additional 15 million francs on the provision of further accom-modation in the new building, in accordance with the recommendations made by the Bureau of the Assembly when they met to consider the plans on 28th January last.Item 11. Any Other BusinessThe most important decisions taken under this heading were : (1) to recommend to the Assembly, in accordance with the procedure decided on at the Committee of Ministers in November, to appoint SignorCaracciolo as Chief of Administrative Services of the Assembly, withthe rank of Deputy Secretary-General;(2) to authorise the Secretary-General to send an official of the Secretariatas an observer to the Congress of the International Institute for the unification of Private Law to be held in Rome in July next.

A copy of the letter is also enclosed for theinformation of the High Commission.Enclosure to Annex BCOMMITTEE OF MINISTERSThird SessionLetter of invitation to the German Federal Government from theSecretary-General to be transmitted through the Allied High commission i am directed by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe tomake the following communication to the German Federal Government.Article 5 of the Statute of the Council of Europe provides that, in specialcircumstances, a European country, which is deemed to be willing and able to fulfil the provisions of Article 3, may be invited by the Committee of ministers to become an Associate Member of the Council of Europe. Having in mind thedesirability of associating Germany with those European countries which are determined to preserve their democratic way of life, the Committee of Ministershereby extend a formal invitation to the German Federal Republic to become anAssociate Member of the Council of Europe.
In conveying this invitation the Committee of Ministers desires me to draw the attention of the Federal German Government to the fact that it would benecessary, in accordance wih Article 5 of the Statute, for that Government todeposit with myself an instrument accepting the Statute. Such an instrumentshould state that the German Federal Republic is willing to accept the guidingprinciples and aims of the Council of Europe as set forth in the Preamble toand in Article 3 of the Statute; a copy of the Statute is transmitted herewith.I am further to state that the number of members of the consultative assembly to which Germany would be entitled would be 18 and the contributionto be paid by Germany would be 126 million French francs for the present financialyear.ANNEX CResolution on Relations between Committee of Ministers andConsultative AssemblyConsidering that any strengthening of the links between the Committee ofMinisters and the Consultative Assembly would be of the greatest advantage, theCommittee of Ministers declares that it is ready to examine, in conjunction withrepresentatives of the Consultative Assembly, the problem of the relations between these two organs of the Council, with a view to determining how best they mayco-operate in the interests of the Council of Europe.Profiting from the presence in Strasbourg of the Standing Committee, theCommittee of Ministers decides to nominate forthwith MM. Schuman, Sforza,Lange and Bevin, and to request them to establish contact with the Standing Com-mittee so that, in agreement with that committee, they may give effect to the above proposal as soon as possible. They are further requested to set up, in conjunctionwith the Standing Committee, a Committee which will study this problem andwhich will report in due course.The Committee would take into consideration all proposals for the improve-ment of relations between the Committee of Ministers and the Assembly, including a proposal already submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of theUnited Kingdom.ANNEX DResolution on Relations between Council of Europe and O.E.E.C.Noting with satisfaction that the Council of the O.E.E.C. is now providing the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe with certain documents on theprogress of work in the O.E.E.C.Considering, furthermore, that it is desirable for the Assembly and its Com-mittees to benefit as far as possible by the studies carried out by the O.E.E.C.,The Committee of Ministers decides : I. To discuss with the Council of the O.E.E.C. arrangements wherebyeconomic and financial Proposals originating in the Consultative Assembly or its committees and transmitted by the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers tothe Council of the O.E.E.C., may be examined by that Organisation and form thesubject of a report to the Committee of Ministers.II. To set up, under the Chairmanship of His Excellency M. NumanMenemencioglu, the Ambassador of Turkey at Paris, a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Ministers, to consider in consultation with the O.E.E.C. theimportant and complex problem involved in the development of an exchange ofinformation, in one form or another, between the two bodies, acting in a spirit of mutual assistance, with due regard for their respective constitutions and functions.
; - .:   ANNEX E&apos; jEconomic Recommendations of the Consultative Assembly, with O.E.E.C.CommentsPreamble1. The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, pledging itself topromote a policy of full employment and a rising standard of life, warns the peoples of Europe that millions among us will soon go hungry and unemployedunless we act at once to re-establish the economic equilibrium between europe and North America.2. The most urgent task is to pay for the food and raw materials whichat present have to be bought in North America. The necessary dollars can onlybe found if a fresh effort is made on both sides of the Atlantic. The countries of Europe must increase their productivity and reduce their costs and sellingprices, so as to adapt themselves to the hard facts of the post-war world. Ontheir side the United States, which recognise the need for Europe to sell more to them, should encourage these imports by every possible means and, in particular,by lowering its customs tariffs.3.   The free nations of Europe can do much to save themselves by mutualhelp.Together with their overseas associates and territories they represent a population which, as regards numbers and skills, is the equal of any otherpopulation in the world. If the peoples of Europe are weak to-day it is becausethey are divided, but if they have the vision and courage to unite their markets,they can lower their costs and selling prices, sell more to each other and morethan recover their lost prosperity.4. The economic union of free Europe should not create an exclusive tradingarea. On the contrary, the door would be open to the exchange of goods and services on fair terms with all the world.5. The realisation of economic union would include the abolition by stages of restrictions on the movement of men, money and goods; the co-ordination ofinvestments, of basic industries of agriculture, and the gradual harmonising ofnational legislation in the field of social policy and taxation.6. This union would include the free circulation of men, goods and capital.It implies the rapid establishment of a multilateral system of payments, leading to the restoration of convertibility of European currencies, with one another,subject to the safeguards necessary to enable movements of transitional period.7. The building up of such a union of free peoples implies central planning,combined with a maximum degree of individual liberty. The central planningmust be by consent, and the liberty must be used for the good of all.O.E.E.C, Comment; i The problems which led to the framing of the Preamble to the Recommenda-tions of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe are also to be foundin the general obligations described in Part I of the Convention for economic co-operation which set up the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and in the preambles to the principal Council decisions, in particular, those of2nd November, 1949, concerning new measures of co-operation.The introduction to the report and the general considerations which thelatter contains show that Member countries are pursuing their recovery effortvery much in the spirit of. the original convention.Recommendation 1The Consultative Assembly requests the Committee of1 Ministers        1To invite the Governments to intensify the spread of economic informationthrough existing channels and at the same time to provide for the Council ofEurope itself to take direct action by every available means to make the peoples of Europe aware of the gravity of the peril in which they are living, and of theadvantages to themselves in uniting their resources in a common effort to regainsolvency and reach a new level of prosperity.
O.E.E.C. Comment .........With the same end in view, the Organisation for European economic co-operation set up from the outset a branch responsible for issuing press releases from Paris on the current work and achievements of the Organisation, and for maintaining contact with the information services of Member countries in orderto co-ordinate their individual efforts to keep their public opinion as fully informed as possible of the work of the Organisation.The Organisation, convinced that the solution of economic problems isfacilitated by an enlightenment of public opinion, welcomes the plan containedin the second part of the Recommendation of the Consultative Assembly., Recommendation 2.&apos; To take all practical steps to establish as quickly as possible a multilateralsystem of payments, including the restoration of the inter-convertibility ofEuropean currencies, subject to the safeguards necessary to enable the movementof capital to be controlled during the transitional period.O.E.E.C. comment the establishment of a multilateral payments scheme is one of the main tasksassigned to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. The idea isto be found in Article 4 of the Convention of 16th April, 1948. During the first two years of the Organisation^ existence, payments were made under twopayments and compensations agreements, the i second of which, signed on 7th September, 1949, makes provisions for multilateral drawing rights up toa certain amount. Since then, in execution of a decision of 2nd November, 1949,designed to enlarge the area of transferability of currencies between member countries, the Organisation is studying the principles of a multilateral paymentsmechanism. .These principles are set out in Section C of Chapter 23 of the Second InterimReport.Recommendation 3To create permanent machinery for consultation on credit policy between central banks of issue, and for the co-ordination of credit policy:O.E.E.C. Comment.On 31st January, 1950, the Organisation decided that the Governments of member countries should compare their financial, economic, social, tariff and investment policies with a view to harmonising such policies insofar as this maybe necessary for the establishment of closer mutual economic and monetary rela-tions. As this undertaking will require considerable time, the Organisation recom-mended that a start should be made as soon as possible and that the effort be con-tinued simultaneously with the measures for the liberalisation of trade planned for 1950.Moreover, in connexion with the new payments agreement which it is pro-posed to put into force as soon as possible, the Organisation is considering thepossibility of creating a European Payments Union (Chapter 23, para-graph 764 ff).Recom menbation 4aTo follow up and extend both the work of O.E.E.C. in liberalising inter-European trade, and studies now being made in regard to the economic relations of Europe and its overseas associates and territories.O.E.E.C. CommentSection B of Chapter 23 of the Report retraces the measures adopted by theOrganisation for the liberalisation of intra-European trade. The Council decisionof 31st January, 1950, inserted in this section sets out the new objectives whichMember countries have set themselves in this field.In the case of the Overseas Territories, the Organisation is carrying out a comparative study of the plans of each country for their economic and socialdevelopment and is endeavouring to ascertain the means for strengthening theeconomic ties between countries and their dependent territories taken as a whole.38628 c
Recommendation 4b ; ,;v. To take all preliminary action for the establishment of a European economic union, which shall retain the preferential systems and economic ties now in exis-tence between certain European nations and the overseas-countries and territoriesassociated with them; and to consider their progressive extension to the other member States of this union..O.E.E.C. Comment , &apos; ,Referring to the terms of paragraph 2 of the Resolution of the Committee ofMinisters of the Council of Europe, the Organisation has decided to ask for the comments of the European Customs Union Study Group on this point. The latterbody was set up to examine the problems involved and the steps which wouldhave to be taken on the formation of a Customs Union. Its composition is thesame as that of the Organisation and the associated countries attend its meet-ings as observer. The Secretary-General has forwarded Appendices 1 and 2 ofDocument S.G. 179 (Official Reports of the 4th and 5th plenary sessions ofthe Study Group) for information and material concerning the present stage ofthe work of the Study Group.The Study Group will study this text on 18th April next, at its plenaryAssembly.Recommendation 4cTo study the development of production within the territories of the Membersof the conference so that their individual import requirements may be met asefficiently as possible from their combined resources.O.E.E.C. CommentThis problem was thoroughly examined when the first two annual programmessubmitted by the Organisation to the Economic Co-operation Administration were drawn up. The second part of the Report deals with the 1950-52 Programme.As part of its Plan of Action for 1949-50, the Organisation decided toexamine to what extent the reduction by Member countries to their dollar imports would make it possible to strike a balance between these imports and available resources. With this end in view, studies have been undertaken on agricultural products, textiles, non-ferrous metals, oil, machinery and timber. Chapter 17 ofthe Report, which deals with the development of resources in non-dollar areas;gives details of the conclusions so far reached in these studies which are still inprogress.Paragraphs 537 to 570 of the same chapter deal with the overseas territories and summarise the considered views of the Organisation on the development ofsources of supply in the overseas territories.&apos; ; IRecommendation 4dTo study appropriate action for the progressive abolition of the obstacles tothe free movement of men and for promoting the widest possible employment oflabour in the metropolitan and overseas territories of Member States and oftheir associates.O.E.E.C. comment the problem of international migration is broached in a section of Chapter 3(paragraphs 122 ff.) of the Report and in Chapter 22. The latter chapter, whichis entirely devoted to this question, makes clear the advantages of creatingchannels of migration while stressing the difficulties involved. It shows that noeasy solution can be found in Europe by the countries working alone.Recommendation 4eTo study the conditions under which the investments in their territories of american and other non-European capital could be encouraged.O.E.E.C. comment the problem of international investments has so far only been the subjectof a preliminary study in the Organisation, whose general policy concerning this problem is described in Chapter 21 of the Report.
As is stated in the last paragraph of this Chapter the importance of theproblem appeared to.be such that it was decided to undertake a more detailed study. A decision of the Organisation dated 10th January, 1950, defines thescope of this study, which is to cover the present conditions and regulations forforeign investments in Member countries and their overseas territories, and methods for promoting international investments, particularly American, ofbenefit to Member countries and their overseas territories and likely to contribute to the attainment of the Organisation^ objectives. A general report on thisquestion will be drawn up in the near future.Recommendation 4fTo extend and develop a system of guaranteed markets.O.E.E.C. CommentIn the course of their work several of the specialised Committees of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation have been led to considerthe part which a system of guaranteed markets might play in the developmentof the production of Member countries and their Overseas Territories.The studies done on this subject have been carried furthest in the case ofagricultural products. The report of the Food and Agricultural Committee(Report on the European Recovery Programme, Volume III, Section 1, attached as Annex D), indicated in paragraphs 40-48, that guaranteed prices and marketswere one of the best ways of stimulating agricultural production.Paragraphs 44, 57 and 58 of a second report by the Food and AgricultureCommittee (A.G. (49) 31 attached as Annex E), also deal with this problem...... Recommendation 4gTo call an economic conference, representing themselves and their overseasassociates and territories, in order to study the above proposals. * !&apos;.O.E.E.C. comment the Organisation is itself a permanent conference and has not so far con-sidered calling a meeting of the kind recommended by the Consultative Assembly.Recommendation 5To call as soon as possible, industrial conferences representing both employers&apos;, workers&apos; and consumers&apos; organisations, as well as government services interested in the main manufacturing and agricultural industries, inorder to make concrete proposals to the Assembly on the organisation of these industries and the increase in their productivity in the common interests ofO.E.E.C. CommentChapter 18 of the Report shows that the Organisation attaches considerable importance to the problem of increasing productivity. The measures taken bythe various Member countries in this field are described in this Chapter and itis to be observed that, in many countries, joint committees of workers and employers have been set up to examine how far it is possible to increase the pro-productivity of the industries concerned. Where such committees do not exist, theOrganisation advocates their establishment.In the first Report published on 30th December, 1948 (Interim Report on theEuropean Recovery Programme), Volume I which I enclose, in Annex F, theOrganisation stressed the importance of European co-operation not being confined to government level (paragraph 421 of the Interim Report). It is for this reason that the Organisation keeps official contact with the E.R.P. Advisory Trade UnionCommittee, the Council of European Industrial Federations and in the agri-cultural field, with the International Federation of Agricultural Producers. Itis through these contacts, that the above bodies can be associated with the Organi-sation&apos;s work on any question of common interest, and particularly that of productivity.
ANNEX FResolutionThe Committee of Ministers transmit to the Consultative Assembly the replyreceived from the O.E.E.C. with the following comments : The letter received from the O.E.E.C. shows that the problems raised by theAssembly&apos;s Recommendations Nos. 2, 3 and 5 are already under examination and are in process of solution by the O.E.E.C.As regards Recommendation No. 1, concerning the intensification of the spread of economic information to the peoples of Europe, the Committee ofMinisters instructs the Secretary-General to establish contact with the O.E.E.C.with a view to initiating the necessary publicity.As regards Recommendation No. 6, concerning the control of internationalCartels, the Committee of Ministers intends to establish i contact with the Pre-paratory Commission of the International Trade Organisation with a view toundertaking a study of this problem in its European context.With regard to Recommendation No. 4, concerning the calling of a european economic Conference, the Committee of Ministers considers that the time has notyet come to convene such a conference.Recommendation 6. .... . .To draw up a draft European convention for&apos; the control of internationalcartels, which it will present to the Assembly.Q.E.E.C. comment the problem of the control of international cartels has not been examined bythe Organisation.
