4 p10SECRETCP. (50) 955TH MAY s 1950CABINETTHE TEA ration memorandum by the Minister of Pood1 . I am sorry to have to tell my colleagues that theoutlook for tea supplies is so uncertain that I can see no alternative but to reduce the ration from its present levelof 2-g- 02S,  per head per week to 2 ozs.      I propose to do this with effect from the 21st May.      Normally proposals forration changes are not brought before the Cabinet but in viewof the obvious implications of this change I have thought itwell to circulate a memorandum on the position.2. The tea ration was at the rate of 2 ozs.  a week from 19oO until July, 1945, when it was raised to 2-g- ozs.It had however to be reduced again to the 2 oz.  level inJuly, 1947.      It was raised to the 2-g- oz.  rate in december last, but my predecessor warned his colleagues at the time(S.P.C. (49)  108 of 11th October, 1949, paragraph 2)  that hecould give no guarantee that it would be possible to maintainthe ration at that rate beyond June, 1950.      It is significant that With the increase in population and the additionalallowances which we have granted consumption is running at about 1 million lbs.  a month more than in the earlier period when the ration was at the 2-i oz. rate.3. The general background is as follows:-(a) World demand is running at unprecedentedly hig?1levels.      This is due to full employment, increased consump-tion in the United States  and the relative scarcity of coffee.      One of the most remarkable post-war developmentsis the large increase in tea consumption in all Easterncountries.(b) Although exports from India, Pakistan and Ceylonare considerably in excess of the restricted pre-war levels,world supplies of tea are short, especially as Indonesianexports are still on a small scale.(c) The Governments of India and Ceylon are doing everything possible to sell the maximum quantity of teathrough auction markets in Calcutta and Colombo.(d) Since 1947, when these auctions were opened, theGovernments concerned have refused to enter into bulk purchase contracts on the ordinary pattern - i.e.   arrangements under which we should have the right to receive at a priceagreed in advance a definite quantity of the commodity or a fixed proportion of the exportable surplus.COPY NO . \J *C

(e) All that we have been able to do in thesecircumstances is to negotiate a framework - i.e.  anarrangement with the Governments specifying the maximumquantity which we can buy in bulk and a basic price.But the actual contracts have to be negotiated, within thetotal figure, with individual producers, and our ability to secure the amount of tea which we require depends entirelyupon the willingness of individual producers to contract forsales to us.(f) It follows that there is no guarantee of any total quantity.      Producers naturally tend to sell to the Ministryonly in so far as they feel that they will be unable to sell &apos;elsewhere at a price higher than that specified in our&quot;framework&quot; agreement with the Governments concerned.      thus the Ministry tends to get the worst of both worlds - itputs a floor under the local market and thereby tends tokeep prices up (particularly when it is known that we haveto buy a given quantity of tea in order to maintain the ration) but gets no guarantee of any definite supplies orof supplies of good quality teas.k* In view of the general supply situation and the pressure of increased sales through Calcutta and Colombo,the preliminary negotiations with the Governments concerned have become more difficult year by year, particularly asprice levels ruling in the Calcutta and Colombo auctions havenormally been above our basic contract price.      This differen-tial has increased since devaluation and since our needs wentup after the introduction of the 2-g- oz. ration.      This year wehave been obliged to offer an increase of kd a lb.   (on average191+9 f.o.b. prices, including export duty, of 2/7d and 3/--Jdper lb.  for Indian and Ceylon teas respectively).      On a totalpurchase from India, Pakistan and Ceylon of 1+30 million lbs.(if we were lucky enough to get as much) this increase will cost approximately  7.16 millions  and we shall be payingapproximately three times the pre-war price for our tea.5. After long negotiations the Governments concerned have accepted our offer of an additional 1+d a lb.      But theposition remains that there is no guarantee that we shallget the quantities which we need at the new price,  and indeed the Governments concerned have made it clear that they willgive no sort of undertaking that this will happen.6. This is the crux of the matter.      In order tomaintain the 2^-oz. ration we need 1+75 million lbs.  of teain a full year.      Even on the most  optimistic assumptionswe could not hope to get this year more than 1+28 million lbs.of tea, made up as follows.:-Countries Million lbs.India 275Ceylon 110East Africa 5Indonesia 10k28

But in the light of their knowledge of the situation and ofthe warnings which we have received from the Governmentsconcerned (especially from Ceylon), my advisers consider thatthe most that we can reasonably hope to get from the countries concerned in 1.950 is approximately 380 million lbs., the short-fall being mainly in the Ceylon supplies.    -This is,of course, no more than an estimate, but it is an estimatebased on an expert judgment of the market and is being con-firmed from all enquiries that we have been, able to makefrom the trade.      The markets are still under great pressure of demand from third countries  (the United States, Australia,etc.)  and prices are being freely given at  a premium overour basic price.7. On the basis of receipts of only 380 million lbs.of new tea supplies against a ration requirement of 1+75million lbs.  there would be a short-fall of 95 million lbs.Tea stocks are at present 120 million lbs.&apos;, and clearlythis short-fall of 95 million lbs. would put us into an impossible position.      Stocks would fall to a completelyunworkable level and we should be defenceless against anyvicissitudes in supply (e.g. the hold up of Indian orPakistan shipments, such as has occurred before, or diffi-culties due to dock strikes or other interruptions here).If we nevertheless decided to take the risk and to maintainthe 2-g- oz. ration we should be in grave danger of losingcontrol of the situation and of being forced to reduce the ration at a time which might be more embarrassing politically and when our stock position would be very weak indeed.8. Given the uneven flow of tea to this  country andthe fact that it takes a month or six weeks between the arrival of tea here and the date at which it can be put out to the trade there would be danger periods in August-october and again in December-March.      There would be a very real risk that unless we reduce the ration and so diminish the strain on our stocks we should find it difficult to maintain-even a 2 oz. ration next year.9. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the right and prudent course is to reduce the ration to the 2 os.  level as soon as possible,  a step which would reduce our require-ments by 80 million lbs.  over a full year.      I should liketo bring this reduction, into effect from the 21st May, despite the tightness of the timetable, since the ration is issued inalternate four week periods at a 3 oz.  and 2 oz. rate respec-tively - and if there were no reduction in the May issue weshould not begin to reduce the outflow of tea until July,and should thus have to forego the saving of 1k million lbs.10. It might be argued that we should offer a pricehigher than hd a lb.  above the 19U9 level in the hope ofthereby attracting more tea from producers.      But quite apartfrom the financial difficulties, this course would not ensurethe receipt of more tea.      It would only tend to drive upthe market price to still higher levels and producers would still tend only to sell to the Ministry in the last resort,particularly as they all have a shrewd idea of our difficul-ties in securing supplies adequate to maintain the 2-g- oz.ration.      If, on the other hand, the ration is cut, theknowledge that the Ministry will require 80 million lbs.  lesstea will have the effect of easing at once pressure on themarket,  of making producers realise that they will have to findalternative markets for that quantity of tea and of making them the more ready to sell to the Ministry.      Indeed,  I believethat this step offers the best hope of our getting in the longrun the increased supplies of tea which will enable us to put the ration up again,

11. I much regret having to recommend, a reductionin the ration of a commodity which, means  so much to our people.      But as I have said, I can see no alternative ifI am to .act with proper prudence and responsibility.      Ishall, of course, retain the special allowances for peopleover 70 and if the position improves later in the year Imay he able to supplement the 2 oz.  ration by some occasionalbonuses, or,    if all goes well, restore, the ration to 2-jr ozs.12. I shall be circulating separately to the economic policy Committee a paper about procurement arrangements fortea in 1951-      I should emphasise that the ration reductionproposed is necessary in my view whatever procurementarrangements may be adopted in future.M.W.Ministry of Pood, S.vv.1.5TH MAY, 1 950.
