confidentialCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 65,.AlL    .non COPY NO     3 028 October 1980CABINET1981-82 CASH LIMITS AND VOTES:ANCILLARY QUESTIONS ON PAYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. Paragraph 6 of C(80) 60 stated that certain ancillary questionsrelating to the pay provision in the 1981-82 cash limits were under separatediscussion.    This note sets out the recommendations I have put to theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy.    My impression is that theywill prove acceptable.2. First, we should oppose any further staging of pay awards from nowon.    If staging does take place cash limits would be set in a way thatensured no financial advantage was gained by those concerned,3. Certain awards were staged in 1980-81, and as a result the total paycosts of the groups in question will be higher in 1981-82 than during thecurrent year, without any increase in current pay rates.    The 1981-82 cashlimits should provide for this increase in costs over and above the generalpay factor to be agreed in the light of paragraph 5 of C(80) 60.4. Second, the early awards in the new pay round are influenced by thecash limit provision in 1980-81 as well as that in 1981-82. The 1980-81cash limits provide 13-14 per cent for these awards. Rather than reducethe 1980-81 cash limits, we should make clear that the 1981-82 cash limitswill only finance these awards to the extent of the pay factor to be agreed inthe light of paragraph 5 of C(80) 60.5. If Cabinet were to decide on a pay factor for the current roundmarkedly different from 6 per cent, it might be necessary to reconsiderthe conclusions set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 above.6. There is one final point.    The 1981-82 cash limits include an elementin respect of certain settlements in the pay round starting on 1 August 1981.In order to make clear the need for continued de-escalation of settlements andto avoid a repetition of the problem of over-provision described inparagraph 4 above, I propose that the figure used for this round should be2 percentage points below the figure Cabinet agree for the current pay round(ie 4 per cent if Cabinet agreed 6 per cent for the current round). Thisfigure would be described as provisional.1confidential
7. 1 invite Cabinet to note paragraphs 3 to 5 above and to endorse theapproach in paragraph 6.GHTreasury ChambersZ8 October 1980
