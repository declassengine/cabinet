confidential! DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 6911 November 1980COPY NO82CABINETTHE CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affair a1. The Canadian Government have informed us that the Canadian FederalParliament are likely, towards the end of this year or early next year, to senda joint Address to the Houses of Parliament in Westminster seeking thepatriation of the Canadian Constitution, with additional provisions for anAmending Formula, a Bill of Rights and an equalisation formula.    The currentproposals of the Canadian Government have given rise to serious objectionsfrom the majority of the Canadian Provinces and have also led to criticism andpublic discussion in this country.2. I attach a paper (Annex A) summarising the main legal arguments infavour of acceding to a request from the Canadian Government, and some ofthe counter-arguments.    It also briefly considers a possible alternative course.3. Mr Trudeau informed the Prime Minister on 25 June of a possiblerequest for patriation, but without mentioning the Bill of Rights.    The PrimeMinister told Mr Trudeau that, whether or not the request was made with theagreement of all the Provinces, a request to patriate would be agreed if it wasthe wish of the Government of Canada.    On 6 October the Canadian Secretaryof State for External Affairs, Mr Mark MacGuigan, and the Minister for theEnvironment, Mr John Roberts, called on both the Prime Minister and myself.The Prime Minister repeated her undertaking regarding patriation, but made itclear that the inclusion of a Bill of Rights was liable to cause controversy anddelay in this country.    The Canadian proposals are now being considered by aJoint Committee of both Houses, which reports on 9 December.4. The Progressive Conservatives, the main opposition party, maintaintheir fundamental objection to Mr Trudeau1 s proposals.    Provincial objectionshave now crystallised; six of the Provinces are broadly opposed to theproposals; three of the others are, to a greater or lesser extent, on the fenceand Ontario alone is happy with the proposals.confidential
confidential5. A potential complication is the involvement of the Canadian courts.Five of the Canadian Provinces have decided to refer constitutional questionsto the Provincial courts prior to putting them to the Supreme Court. Ourlegal advice is that, if the matter is sub judice in Canada when a request forpatriation is received in this country, we should not proceed.    I attach a papersetting out the considerations (Annex B).6. We have a major interest in maintaining good relations with Canada - animportant Commonwealth country with a significant role to play in the Westernalliance and on the international scene generally.    To go back now on what theCanadians will regard as our undertakings over patriation would be to invite amajor rew.    As Annex A makes clear, the legal arguments justifying ouracceding to a Federal request for patriation are not unassailable;  but wecannot please both the Federal Government and the Provinces.    It is with theFederal Government that we deal.    Mr Trudeau is in full control of themajority party, and wedded to the idea of patriation with a Bill of Rights. Itis thus in my view inconceivable that we should fail to meet this request asquickly as possible if and when it comes.    This is of course provided that thequestion of possible reference to the Canadian courts is resolved.CForeign and Commonwealth Office11 November 19802confidential
CONFIDENTIALANNEX ATHE CANADIAN CONSTITUTION:    LEGAL ARGUMENTSPart A of this annex summarises briefly the main legalarguments which can be deployed in support of a decision to goahead on the basis of a request from the Federal Government with-out taking account of objections from the Provinces,  and Part Bsome of the more persuasive of those which may be deployed against.Part C considers the possibility of an alternative course.A. Legal Arguments for ProceedingDespite Provincial Objections2. The arguments are two-fold.      First,  the Statute ofWestminster, which governs the question of constitutional amend-ment, makes no mention of a role for the Provinces;    nor have theyin practice played a substantial role in the past.      Second, thereis the comity argument;    as a sovereign state, Canada is representedinternstionally by the Federal authorities alone and to takecognisance of Provincial views would be an unwarranted interferencein Canadian internal affairs.Statute of Westminster3. The effect of the Statute of Westminster is that noparticular procedure is prescribed for the repeal,  amendment oralteration of the British North America Acts.     The constitutionalconvention reflected in the third preambular paragraph of theStatute and enacted as law in its section 4 is that legislationenacted by the Otaited Kingdom shall not extend to a Dominionotherwise than 11 at the request and with the consent of thatDominion&quot; .      In the case of Canada, there has been no questionthat the &quot; request and consent&quot;   required has been that of theFederal Government and Parliament.      In practice, the method ofconveying 11 request and consent&quot;   has been by means of a jointaddress of both Houses of the Canadian Parliament.4. As to the relevance of Provincial attitudes, the precedentsin relation to the British North America Acts show that even wherethere have been Provincial misgivings or objections we have actedon a request of the Federal Government and Parliament, whether ornot the &quot; request and consent&quot;   convention has been regarded atthe time as applying.     This seems generally to have been the caseeven before the Statute of Westminster:    thus, Mr Churchill in hisSecond Reading Speech on 15 June 1907 (H.C.Deb 1616) said that :1 1 He did not pretend to go into the merits of the differenceon a constitutional question between British Columbia andthe Federal Government.     We on this side did not knowenough to decide upon the merits of the claim.      On theother hand, he would be very sorry if it were thought thatthe action which His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided totake meant that they had decided to establish as a precedentthat whenever there was a difference on a constitutional- 1 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALquestion between the Federal Government and one of theprovinces, the Imperial Government would always be preparedto accept the Federal point of view as against the provin-cial.      In deference to the representations of BritishColumbia the words &quot; final and unalterable&quot;   applying tothe revised scale had been omitted from the Bill.&quot;This statement, despite its acknowledgement of a Provincialconcern, seems to have constituted, essentially, a refusal toenter the arena of Federal/Provincial dispute which is even moreappropriate now than it was then.5. Since the Statute of Westminster, practice seems to havebeen consistent:    thus, Mr Attlee on 22 July 1943 (H.C.Deb 1102)in the Second Reading Debate on the Bill which became the BritishNorth America Act 1943,  said that :&quot; I have no information as to any province objecting, but,in any case, the matter is brought before us by an Addressvoted by both Houses of [the Canadian] Parliament, and itis difficult for us to look behind that fact.&quot;6. On this view,  it is wrong to treat the Statute of Westminsteras involving a preservation of the status quo as between theFederal authorities and the Provinces of which the United Kingdomwas to be the stake-holder.     The most that the Statute and thehistory of its enactment show is that a decision was consciouslytaken not to deal with the question of amendment of the BritishNorth America Acts in substance because (as had been asserted inthe course of discussions in Canada) :&quot; no restatement of the procedure for amending theConstitution of Canada can be accepted by the Provinceof Ontario that does not fully and frankly acknowledge theright of all the Provinces to be consulted and to becomeparties to the decision arrived at&quot;and other Provinces agreed with this.     Accordingly,  in itsapplication to Canada, the Statute is more properly to be seenas a reflection of Canadian inability to agree on the issue ofamendment, with the question of appropriate Canadian proceduresbeing left in abeyance.Comity7. The comity argument was stated by Sir Edward Grigg (Altrincham)as follows in the course of the debate on 22 July 1943 (H.C.Deb 1103)&quot; I suggest that it is really improper in present circum-stances for the House to question the discretion of asovereign Parliament in the Commonwealth of Nations. It- 2 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALis owing to a technical legislative pecularity that itcomes to the House at all, and it is very improper thatthe House should question the discretion of a nationaland absolutely sovereign Parliament.      I hope that thiswill be accepted by the House and that this legislationwill be passed without  further comment.1&apos;The argument, which apparently enjoyed the support of otherMembers of Parliament in that debate,  has two elements. First,it recognises that the reservation of an amending power by theStatute of Westminster has become an anachronism.     To look behinda request to exercise the power would be to lend a weight to thelegal effect of the reservation which is not now justified. Secoas regards the international relations aspects, Canada has beenfully independent at least since the Statute of Westminster.Our relationship with Canada is in international law no differentfrom that with any non-Commonwealth independent sovereign state.The sole representative in international law of a Federal Stateis the Federal Government.     To look behind a request from theFederal Government and enquire into the basis on which it wasput forward would rightly be regarded as an unwarranted inter-ference in the internal affairs of an independent friendly state.It has already been made abundantly clear that Mr Trudeau wouldregard it as such.B. Legal Arguments for Having Regard toProvincial Objections8.     The main arguments, some of which have already been airedin The Times (notably in letter from Dr Geoffrey Marshall on 18September and from Professors Bernier and Treblay on 29 October)are,  in summary, that :(a) the precedents should be discounted because the current caseis in reality quite different in kind;(b) the claim that the Federal Government, as speaking for anindependent sovereign state, need alone be heeded in thedealings of that State with another is artificial in thiscase; and(c) the Statute of Westminster was intended to prevent amendmentsat the unilateral request of the Federal Government andParliament.Argument (a) is that, whatever the precedents, never before havethe proposals of the Federal Government been objected to by themajority of the Provinces, nor have the amendments requestedhitherto been of such a far-reaching character.      In these cir-cumstances any convention against looking behind a Federalrequest does not apply.      This argument is met by the comityagreement (paragraph 7 above)..CONFIDENTIAL
confidentialTHE CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONANNEX BREFERENCE TO THE CANADIAN COURTS.The Times of 6 November quotes extracts from the Federal&apos;Report to Cabinet on Constitutional discussions 1980&apos;dated30 August.    A copy of the report has been supplied by our HighCommission.    The following passage appears on page 52 under theside-heading &apos;Legal Strategy&apos;.&apos;There would be a s trong strategic advantage in having thejoint resolution passed and the UK legislation enactedbefore a Canadian court had occasion to pronounce on thevalidity of the measure   and the procedure employed to achieveit.    This would suggest the desirability of swift passage ofthe resolution and UK legislation.&apos;On the next page, the paper makes the point:&apos;This would also require careful explanation to the BritishGovernment, which might otherwise take the position that itwould not submit the matter to its Parliament until the SupremeCourt of Canada had pronounced&apos;.2. On 23 October, the Attorneys-General of six of the Provinces(Manitoba, Quebec, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Nova Scotiaand Alberta) agreed to launch actions in the provincial courtsof Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland as a preliminary to referenceto the Supreme Court.    Nova Scotia has subsequently withdrawnfrom this action.    In Manitoba, the provincial cabinet is hopingfor a court date before Christmas.    The High Commission have justinformed us that in Quebec a date is hoped for before the end ofNovember.    The questions to be put before the court in Manitobawill be as follows:(a) whether, if amendments to the Constitution as sought by theFederal Government were enacted, Federal-provincial relationships,rights, powers and privileges as described in the Constitutionwould be changed, and if so, in what way;(b) whether it is a constitutional practice that the FederalGovernment should ask The Queen to put before the British Parlia-ment a measure to amend Canada&apos;s Constitution in a way that wouldalter Federal-provincial relationships without first obtainingagreement of the Provinces;(c) whether the agreement of the Provinces is required foramendment to the Constitution where Federal-provincial relationshipswould be affected.3. The basis upon which such proceedings may be instituted remainsobscure.    If, however, any legal proceedings instituted in Canadawere to include an application for an interim injunction, declara-tion or equivalent order restraining the Canadian Parliament frommaking the request, the possibilities for legal action in Canadashould be clarified or exhausted before any issue arises as towhether to legislate here.- 1 -confidential
CONFIDENTIAL4. Another possibility is that the matter might come beforethe Canadian Supreme Court tte way of a reference requesting anAdvisory Opinion.    There is -at least one precedent for thisin the reference made by the Federal Attorney General onConstitutional Bill C.60.    The questions referred askedwhether the Federal Parliament had certain powers to legislate.The Court replied very clearly, saying &apos;no&apos;  in terms to thequestions it was able to answer (1980 1 S.C.R. 54).5. Particularly in the case of a request for an advisoryopinion, the Federal Government might claim to be free to actregardless of the outcome.    In general terms, however,  if pro-ceedings were being entertained in the Canadian courts,  in what-ever form and whether in a provincial, court or in the SupremeCourt, which put in issue the validity of the request or whichsought to challenge the validity in Canada of any resultantUnited Kingdom legislation it would,  in our view, be wrong toact on the request while the matter was sub judice.    (A casein 1949, when the legislation confirming the Terms of Unionbetween Canada and Newfoundland went ahead in the United Kingdomdespite the fact that an appeal in proceedings by six inhabitantsof Newfoundland had been made to the Privy Council, is in ourview distinguishable.6.    When the Prime Minister saw Messrs Roberts and MacGuigan on6 October, she asked whether there was likely to be an appealin the Canadian courts against the legality of what the BritishGovernment were doing.    Mr Roberts replied that this was not onthe cards.   Mr Ridley then commented that it would, nonetheless,be very awkward if the British Government were to patriate aConstitution that the Canadian Courts might subsequently findillegal.- 2 -CONFIDENTIAL
