lo  SECRETOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 6227 October 1980COPY NO81CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: SCOTLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland1. In C(80) 58 (paragraph 4 of the Annex) the Chief Secretary proposesthat I should make total reductions of  150 million a year in my ScottishOffice programmes covered by the &quot;block&quot; arrangements (which excludesAgriculture, Fisheries. Forestry and most Trade, Industry, Energyand Employment expenditure).    Of this about  60 million would be foundin 1981-82 by app1ying the usual formula arrangements to the net changein corresponding English programmes; the balance of  90 million isdescribed as being &quot;on account of assessed need&quot;.    The issues raised bythe second part of this proposal are of such importance that I must bringthem to the collective attention of my colleagues.2. I will of course make the formula based reductions flowing fromwhatever decisions we take on comparable English programmes.   I seeno reason why the Scottish Office should not make its full contribution tothe economies we all have to make.    However to go even further bydiscriminating against Scotland only would be to invite political disaster,and I cannot agree to it.    I made my general position on this clear in myminute of 8 July to the Prime Minister (copy attached).3. I have fully carried out the undertaking I gave at Cabinet on 10 July(CC(80) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2), namely to consider additional cuts inScottish programmes provided they would not be seen as being discriminatory.I have concluded that this cannot be done, because -1. The Needs Assessment Study (NAS) on which the Treasuryhave founded their proposal, is incomplete, is methodologicallysuspect and was in any case not designed for this purpose. Thepresent relativities derive from the decisions of successiveGovernments of both parties with Treasury agreement.    If they areto be changed this really cannot be done on the basis of the study oron raw per capita comparisons.   To make special cuts by referenceto public expenditure in parts of the United Kingdom is a major -and in my view dangerous - change.1SECRET
SECRET2. To find the total deductions of  150 million a year soughtby the Treasury is simply impracticable.   In 1981-82 I could notfind sufficient savings even if I were to make all achievable cutsin current expenditure and impose a total moratorium untilMarch 1982 on all capital expenditure which is not already legallycommitted or in relation to which a statutory obligation exists.3. As I indicated in my minute of 8 July, there are politicalobjections which override even the compelling arguments set outabove.    To alter Scotland1 s relative share of block expenditureby making reductions over and above thos* determined by theformula would be utterly disastrous politically.   Such a decisionwould be clearly seen in Scotland by all the Opposition parties asa deliberate act of policy directed against Scotland, and I would behard put to explain it, let alone defend it, to our own supporters.No-one in Scotland will accept the NAS as valid evidence.   I myselftold the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs (with Treasuryagreement) in July that the NAS could not be used for this purpose.Nor could I justify the imposition on Scottish services under mycontrol of cuts far in excess of the level of cuts to be made oncomparable services in England.    Such a decision would utterlydestroy cur credibility in Scotland and would be handing the ScottishNational Party precisely the issue they have been looking for.G YScottish Office27 October 19802SECRET
ANNEXWHITEHALL, LONDONSCOTTISH OFFICE2 A UCONFIDENTIALPrime Minister &apos;&quot;1;PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1986: SCOTLAND1. In C(80)40, the Chief Secretary proposes that my pro-grammes  (excluding agriculture and fisheries)  should bereduced by  150m a year over the next three years. Thisreduction would be additional to those flowing from hisspecific proposals on health, education, etc.    I was givenno warning,  formal or informal, of this proposal whichpurports to reflect the outcome of a me&apos;eting of Ministerson 1 May held to consider the Needs Assessment Study com-pleted last year.2. In fact, as the note of that, meeting records, there wasgeneral agreement that it would be very difficult politicallyto alter relative shares by re-distributing existing publicexpenditure allocations, particularly since any suchre-distribution would have to be made public.    We did, however,agree that it would be legitimate to take account of theresults of the Needs Assessment Study as a relevant factorin taking decisions on the distribution of increases orreductions in public expenditure plans.    In taking thisdecision the Ministers concerned were all aware that the greatbulk of my expenditure is, in total, adjusted in proportionto changes in the total of comparable programmes in Englandand Wales.    The formula by which this is done was made publicwith Treasury agreement at the same time as the last PublicExpenditure White Paper;    and, as it happens,  I was questionedin detail about this by the Scottish Select Committeeyesterday.3. The needs Assessment Study was part of the ill-fateddevolution proposals which assumed an arm&apos;s length relation-ship between the UK Government and a Scottish Assembly. Manyof us, in resisting the Assembly, argued-that Scotland would doless well financially if it had one.    The Chief Secretary&apos;sproposal totally undermines this argument - and this on thebasis of a Study which the Chief Secretary himself acknowledgeswas not intended to determine relative levels of publicexpenditure.   As you said in the House last week it is rightthat public cxpcsnuit urcs pea. -ntsct-u in Scotland is greater by aconsiderable amount than in England ana Wales.
  CONFIDENTIAL4. A few key figures will show what the Chief Secretary&apos;sproposal would mean.    He excludes agriculture and fisheries:in the light of our manifesto commitments I must also excludehealth and law and order from my calculations.    Present plansfor the rest of my programmes provide for cuts of nearly11%% between this year and 1984.    The Chief Secretary&apos;sproposal would put this up to almost 18%.    This is, quitesimply, impracticable.5. We need not imagine that any changes in public expendi-ture shares can be made by stealth.    Public knowledge of theformula and the close interest shown by the Scottish SelectCommittee and the Scottish press will see to that.    What isproposed is not re-distribution:,   it is, and will be seen as,a scheme to balance the national books by forcing Scotlandto take debilitating medicine not prescribed for any otherpart of the UK.    I need hardly explain to you what a disasterany move of this sort would be for our whole politicalposition in Scotland.    To do it within 18 months of thereferendum and at a time of the highest unemployment sincethe war would be very hard to justify.    My own credibilityif I were to agree to such a proposal would be gravely weakenedboth with public opinion and our own Party supporters.6. I shall of course be prepared to argue my case inCabinet, but I think it right to make my position clear toyou beforehand.    I should not have been put in the positionof having to challenge in Cabinet a proposal of such importanceto me when I have had no previous warning of it and when itis in conflict with an earlier Ministerial agreement.7. I am copying this minute to other members of the Cabinet,the Chief Whip, the Minister of Transport and Sir RobertArmstrong.8 JULY 1980
