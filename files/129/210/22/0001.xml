SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 72 COPY NO17 November 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. I undertook at Cabinet on 13 November (CC(80) 40th Conclusions,Minute 7) to circulate a paper drawing together the results cf the decisionsreached so far and their wider implications for the Government&apos;s economicstrategy.THE ARITHMETIC2. I attach tables showing the results for public expenditure (Table 1) and,for 1981-82 only, for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)(Table 2).3. Two cases are shown for each of the future years: Case A with nofurther cuts beyond those already agreed or offered; Case B with the out-standing proposals accepted in full, namely:Defence is reduced by  500 million rather than the  152 millionoffered by the Secretary of State.Social Security is cut by  200 million in 1981-82 (including the agreed 60 million resulting from the switch to monthly payment of ChildBenefit) and by about  350 million in subsequent years.Scottish Programmes are subject to a specific cut of  20 million in1981-82, and  30 million a year thereafter, rather than the  10 milliona year offered by the Secretary of State.Health cash limited Central Government expenditure is cut by 1 per centrather than nothing as previously agreed.SECRET
SECRETNATIONALISED INDUSTRIES4. Together with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, I have re-examined thedecisions on nationalised industries&apos; External Financing Limits taken in ECommittee on 5 November.    I am reluctantly persuaded that furtherreductions there could only be achieved by larger price increases or by evenmore severe investment cuts - the reductions we have already agreed arerelatively more severe than those which we are making in other programmes.Indeed, there would be a real risk that, even with the best will, the manage-ments of some nationalised industries could not produce further reductions inpractice.THE RESULTS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ?5. As Table 1 makes clear our expenditure plans for 1981-82 are going tobe substantially higher than the target we set in July - by  2 billion in Case A,by  l| billion in Case B (these figures are at &quot;1980 Survey&quot; prices, ie theprices of late 1979).    Instead of the total being below the March White Paperlevel, because of the  0. 7 billion European Community refund, it would be 1. 3 billion above it in Case A, and  0. 7 billion in Case B.    The comparisonin 1982-83 is even worse.6. In Case A expenditure plans for next year would be much the same asthe outturn now expected for this year - itself about  7 billion (at late 1979prices) above the planned level - and higher than the outturn in any year since1976-77, and nearly  4 billion higher than the post-International MonetaryFund low in 1977-78.7. At the same time Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be declining asour economy is confronted by the general recession in the world economy, themajor difficulties of adjusting to higher oil prices and their effect on theexchange rate, and the need to reduce further the rate of inflation. Publicexpenditure as a proportion of GDP will rise: 41 per cent in 1977-78, 41^ percent in 1979-80 and about 43 per cent in 1981-82.8. While the plans will still show expenditure falling in the subsequentyears, the commentators would justifiably point out that as so often in the pasta promised downturn in public expenditure has been once again postponed.Once again a White Paper showing dramatic &quot;cuts&quot; in public expenditure will befollowed by one in which the totals are significantly increased.9. The Government&apos;s commitment to the reduction of public expenditureonly has- a chance of remaining credible if we are at least seen to be takingsome action to curb the still substantially growing programmes - Defence,Social Security and Health - and being ready to take the politically difficultdecisions required.    Even on my proposals expenditure on these programmes(which between them account for about two-thirds of all Central Governmentexpenditure) will be respectively 11 per cent, 10 per cent and 5 per cent higherin 1983-84 than in 1978-79.2SECRET
SECRETTHE RESULTS FOR THE ECONOMY10. As Table 2 shows, if no further cuts were agreed, thv. PSBR next yearwould be about S 12| billion, before taking account of measures to increaserevenue.    If my remaining proposals were agreed in full it would still be 12 billion.    Both are far above the level likely to be consistent with successin the medium term in our fight against inflation and the achievement ofsubstantial reductions in interest rates.11. Reductions in the PSBR on the scale now required will mean significantincreases in the tax burden.    We are taking steps to raise further revenuefrom the North Sea.    Even so, given the pressing need to shift the balance infavour of the (non-oil) company sector, substantial additional revenues willhave to be taken from individuals.    Given our failure to contain publicexpenditure within our previous plans, the prospect is now that, in addition tothe employee national insurance contribution which we discussed, I shall haveto increase the real burden of personal taxation in the Budget.12. The increases in public expenditure for the later years put seriously atrisk the chances of making any significant ieduction in that tax burden then.CONCLUSION13. I consider it essential to the maintenance of our economic strategy andthe credibility of our commitment to reduce public expenditure in the mediumterm that we should make the greater part of the additional cuts now proposed,so that the totals are close to those shown for Case B.G HTreasury Chambers17 November 19803SECRET
