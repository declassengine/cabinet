confidentialDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 70 COPY NO11 November 1980CABINETPAY FACTORS IN CASH LIMITSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerI.        I was invited at Cabinet on 6 November (CC(80) 39th Conclusions,Minute 3) to circulate a memorandum on the implications of the decisionsthat:i. the pay factor in the cash limit for the rate support grant (RSG)settlement for 1981-82 would be 6 per cent;ii. announcements of cash limits for other parts of the publicservices would be made when they were operationally necessary;iii. for planning purposes the objective should be to achievea 6 per cent pay factor in the cash limit for the financial year1981-82 throughout the whole of the public services, the limit toapply provisionally in respect of settlements in the 1981-82 payround as well as of settlements in the 1980-81 round.2.        Public  iwjpiiAliiiiii&apos;    has already been heavily influenced by theannouncement of the 6 per cent pay factor for the RSG, and the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement that the remainder of the public services would bedealt with broadly within the same financial disciplines.    This hasproduced the expected favourable response from the private sector wherepeople have been looking for a lead from the Government in dealing withits own employees.    We have undertaken to be firm on this issue, and muchof the benefit would be lost if we now appeared hesitant and uncertain.But there are arguments in favour of our retaining as much flexibility asis consistent with our broader counter-inflation objective.confidential
confidentialIMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS3. The responsible managements will need to know the Government&apos;sdecisions on the pay factors for next year&apos;s cash limits before paynegotiations with each group of public service employees are taken veryfar.    Very early decisions will therefore be needed in the case of:i. university technicians - the university authorities havealready agreed a provisional settlement staged over 18 monthsgiving increases amounting to an annual rate of about 18 per cent,but an early indication of the pay factor could lead them toreconsider.ii. University teachers - the authorities and the teachershave proposed increases of 13 per cent as a basis for negotiationwith the Secretary of State, who has delayed any response untilhe can indicate the pay factor in the relevant cash limit.iii. National Health Service (NHS) ancillaries - the next meetingwith the management side of the Whitley Council is on 1 December.The Council will need to be informed of the pay factor at, orpreferably before, that meeting.4. These cases apart, the only major public service groups remainingare the Armed Forces and the Civil Service.    We are to consider theformer separately.    There is no operational need for an earlyannouncement about the latter.ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES5. From the standpoint of flexibility, it would be convenient if we couldannounce the pay factor for each group as the need arose, having regard onlyto the particular circumstances of that group.    Such a course would,however, undermine the negotiating position of the local authority and otheremployers who settle relatively early in the pay round, since it would riskleaving the impression that the Government would be ready to treat latergroups more leniently.    On the other hand to announce now that, come whatmay, the figure for every group would be 6 per cent would remove everytrace of flexibility and would be readily misinterpreted as a rigid pay norm.In practice, therefore, I see two alternative courses:i.        Fix and announce the pay factors now for each group,prescribing a scatter of different figures around 6 per cent dependingon the circumstances in each case (ie lower figures in cases wherethere is more flexibility from reductions in numbers or alternativesources of revenue).2confidential
confidentialii         Confirm 6 per cent as the factor for the three groups inparagraph 3, and use the same figure as a working assumptionin the preparation of the Departmental Estimates. Formalindications would then be given later as the timing of negotiationsrequired.6. The first course would be attractive in rebutting accusations of paynorms.    But although I should like to adopt an entirely pragmatic approach,it seems unrealistic now to propose a figure lower than 6 per cent in anyindividual case, while it would be very hard to justify higher figures forcentral Government groups either to the local authorities or to publicopinion at large.    I am led, therefore, to prefer the second approach.7. We also need to let the employers know our attitude to staging infuture and how we propose to provide for the effects of staging last yearof the settlements of the non-industrial Civil Service, teachers anduniversity teachers.   I propose that we should deal with these on the basisset out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of C(80) 65.    We shall also need to makeclear how we intend to calculate the cash limits for financial year 1981-82for those groups, of which the local authority manuals, the firemen, theNHS ancillaries and the university teachers are the most important,where there is &quot;over-provision&quot; in the cash limits for financial year1980-81.   I propose that we should adopt the approach I suggested inparagraph 4 of C(80) 65.CONCLUSIONS8. I invite my colleagues to agree that:a. The pay figure for the cash limits on the universitiesgrant and the hospitals should be set at 6 per cent.b. No immediate final decision should be taken on the CivilService, but that a firm figure of 6 per cent should be used forplanning purposes, including preparation of next year&apos;s Estimates.c. The problem of past staging and overhang should be dealtwith as proposed in paragraph 7 and that an early announcementshould be made on this.G HTreasury Chambers11 November 19803confidential
