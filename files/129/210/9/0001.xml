CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 59 COPY NO 5422 October 1980CABINETTHE ECONOMIC PROSPECT AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1. Last March Cabinet endorsed the Medium Term Financial Strategy(MTFS) for bringing about a permanent reduction in the rate of inflation,and thereby creating the conditions for a sustained growth of output,employment and living standards.    Essential to the strategy was a declineover the period in public sector borrowing, so that the monetary decelerationcould be achieved while at the same time reducing interest rates*?..        There are some encouraging signs that the strategy is beginning tobring about greater realism in pay and pricing.   We must build upon thissuccess by holding to the strategy.    This means that we must take thedecisions necessary to ensure that public expenditure, borrowing and thegrowth of money supply - which have all been too high recently - are broughtfirmly under control.    If we fail to do this we will do immense damage tothe overriding objectives we have set ourselves of reducing inflation,interest rates and the tax burden.3. This paper outlines the economic prospect and sets out the policydecisions we need to take to implement our strategy.THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUND4. We are clearly in a period of recession for the industrialisedcountries.    World inflation rose and output began to decline from the firstquarter of 1980.    This decline is likely to continue through the rest of thisyear, and 1981 could be a year of relatively slow recovery.5. The prospects for the United Kingdom economy are dominated by thecumulative effects of past and present inflation and low productivity. Thesecan be seen most clearly in the serious loss of competitiveness and the lowlevel of company profitability.    The volume of exports has so far held up1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwell, but the very rapid rise in world trade during 1979 and the earlymonths of 1980 to some extent masked the effects of the loss ofcompetitiveness.    With world trade slackening the volume of exports mayfall from now on.    Lower exports and reductions in stocks are likely tobe the main factors reducing output in the short-term.6. The fall in gross domestic product (GDP) this year seems likelyto be close to the 2f per cent forecast at Budget-time; but the recessionmay be deeper in 1981 than had been thought earlier.    The latest forecastssuggest that output in 1981 may fall by about the same amount as this year,but within the year the pace of decline should slacken and there may besome upturn in the second half leading to resumed growth in subsequentyears.7. On inflation the picture is brighter.    There has been a markedreduction in the rate of inflation in the past six months.    In the immediatefuture progress may be slowed by the lagged effects of the rise in wagecosts in the 1979-80 pay round and by increases in nationalised industryprices; the 12-month increase in the Retail Price Index is expected to beabout 11 per cent by late 1981 (this would also be equivalent to 11 per centbetween the financial years, which is relevant for cash limits).   A singlefigure outcome is possible but a number of favourable factors - for example,a continuing rise in the exchange rate, a further substantial squeeze inprofit margins, a fall in mortgage rates, continuing weak world prices,and single figure average pay settlements - would generally have to go inthe right direction. On balance we must expect some of these factors togo in the wrong direction.8. Further progress in reducing inflation will depend critically onthe course of pay increases.    The most effective way in which we caninfluence the private sector is to convince everyone that we will stick tothe financial strategy, whatever the short-term difficulties, and to settlepublic sector pay at a low figure.9. So far the reduction in inflation has come about in a way that haspermitted a further rise in real personal incomes because it has affectedprices before earnings.    The burden of adjustment has fallendisproportionately on company profits.    This means that the finances ofmany companies are extremely vulnerable in the immediate future unlesswage settlements are low.   A fall in real earnings over the next year orso is essential, and indeed this seems now to be widely accepted.PUBLIC FINANCES AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING REQUIREMENT(PSBR)10. The Treasury&apos;s latest forecasts put the PSBR for 1980-81 at over 10 billion.    This is  2 billion above the Budget forecast, much of itbecause of over-runs in expenditure.    This over-spending has been a2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmajor reason for the difficulties we have experienced this year in gettingto the point when we can look forward to a significant fall in interestrates.11. For 1981-82 the forecast PSBR is over  11 billion.    This assumesthat the cuts in programmes proposed by the Chief Secretary in July arefully achieved, but allows the expenditure totals to increase to the fullextent of the adjustment in demand-determined programmes (such associal security) and expected expenditure shortfalls caused by the revisedeconomic prospects.    It also assumes full inflation adjustment of personaland expenditure taxes in the 1981 Budget and public services pay rises of9 per cent.   A PSBR of the size implied by this forecast would have themost serious implications for interest rates.IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMONETARY POLICY12. We must stick to our two main objectives: lower inflation andlower interest rates.    This means that there can be no question ofdeparting from our monetary objectives.   To do so would have adisastrous effect on inflation, interest rates and the climate for paybargaining.13. Ore consequence of the recent high public sector spending andborrowing is that interest rates will need to remain high for longer thanwe had hoped.   The first requirement now is to secure an out-turn for themoney supply in the current financial year that is consistent with the targetrange set last spring.    For this we shall have to rely primarily onmonetary instruments, particularly selling more government debt topersons by &quot;granny bonds&quot; and other means.14. For 1931-82 and later years we must take action to keep monetarygrowth within the range set out in the MTFS.    This will entail fiscalmeasures to reduce the prospective PSBR.THE PSBR15. What size of PSBR in 1981-82 we should aim at cannot be decidednow.   But it is clear that we must aim at a borrowing requirementsubstantially below that indicated in the latest forecasts.16. The illustrative path in the MTFS envisaged a PSBR equivalent toabout 3 per cent of GDP in 1981-82: the forecasts imply one of around4f per cent.    To get back to the MTFS figure would entail a reduction ofabout  4 billion.    To go that far in a year of recession would not bewarranted; but if we wish to create conditions in which interest rates canfall we must seek a reduction of at least  2j billion from the currentforecast figure of over  11 billion.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL17. Since that forecast already assumes that the specific reductions inprogrammes proposed by the Chief Secretary in July are fully achieved thisis a formidable objective.TAXATION18. On the tax side I am considering a number of options for raisingrevenues, including the possibility of obtaining additional revenue from theNorth Sea.    But these obviously cannot close more than part of the gap.Even with the cuts in public expenditure proposed in the Chief Secretary&apos;spaper (C(80) 58) it will almost certainly be necessary to raise the realweight of personal taxation.    The real tax burden was increased in the lastBudget;  I need hardly stress the difficulties, and disappointments, that anyfurther increase would entail.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE19. The credibility of, indeed the chances of achieving, our wholestrategy vitally depends on holding public expenditure within our ownpublished planning totals.20. The changes in the prospects for the economy from those that underlaythe White Paper figures mean that there is likely to be higher spending onsocial security and items such as housing and export credit subsidies. Inaddition, discussions with the nationalised industries reveal a seriousdeterioration in their financial prospects.21. The proposals in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper are addressed tobringing back public expenditure volumes as nearly as possible within ourpublished planning totals.   But in itself this would do little to reduce thePSBR below the present forecast.    We need to go virtually that far to validatethe assumptions already in the forecast.22. There is thus a strong case that we should seek larger cuts.    But Irecognise the difficulties of this.    Even if we modify the objective ofrestoring the planning totals by not deducting the full savinos from theEuropean Community settlement, keeping within them would require cuts inprogrammes of about  2 billion (at late 1979 prices) in 1981-82 (and some-what larger sums in the later years).    As the proposals in the ChiefSecretary&apos;s paper make clear this will entail some very difficult anddisagreeable decisions.    But unless we face up to this issue there is noprospect of getting back to the path of our medium-term strategy andsecuring the reductions in monetary growth and interest rates we seek.And in the nearer term there would be very bleak implications for taxation.23. We must also act on the cost of public expenditure programmes aswell as their volume.    The PSBR reflects the cash costs of programmes, inrelation to our cash receipts from taxes.    One way therefore to reduce thePSBR beyond what can be achieved by volume cuts is to reduce the cost ofprogrammes relative to other costs in the economy.    In particular, a smallerincrease in public services pay, as envisaged in paragraph 5 of my paper onpay and price factors C(80) 60, would be a substantial help.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION24. The prospects for this financial year and next are extremely difficult.For bom years the PSBR on present policies is likely to be much higher thanis compatible with easing the pressure on interest rates within the continuingframework of our medium-term financial strategy.25. For the current year monetary instruments must continue to bear themain strain, though it is vital that cash limits should be held.26. For next year, although I am considering what extra revenue can beobtained, we must do all we can on public expenditure. Otherwise there islittle hope of getting interest rates dcwn.27. In the later years, the PSBR and interest rate problems may be lessacute.    But if these are to be years in which, as we all hope, taxes andinterest rates are coming down and industrial and economic confidence goingup then it is vital that we contain public expenditure within the earlier plans.G HTreasury Chambers22 October 19805CONFIDENTIAL
