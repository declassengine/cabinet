I attach a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliamentwhich has been revised in the light of the discussion in Cabinet on 23 Octoberand subsequent consultations with the Ministers concerned.2. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the other businessmanagers stressed the importance of avoiding commitments in the OpeningSpeech to a legislative programme which the Government might not in the eventbe able to carry through and of leaving the business managers sufficient scopeto propose the dropping of one or more Bills from the programme previouslyagreed by Cabinet if the pressures of Parliamentary time later in the Sessionmade this inevitable.    He has written to the Ministers concerned suggestingthe deletion of the implicit or explicit references to the Civic Government(Scotland), the Health and Social Services (Miscellaneous Provisions),Companies, Insurance Companies and Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgment Bills.Since these consultations are not yet complete, the attached draft includes therelevant references to these Bills in square brackets on page 5.    I hope,however, that my colleagues will agree that some or all of the referencesshould be deleted on the understanding that this does pot imply that the Bills willnecessarily be omitted from the legislative programme for next Session.3. There are three points outstanding: /a. The reference to Sri Lanka in the passage on State Visits (page 1)is still in square brackets. I hope we can remove the square bracketsor delete the reference at Cabinet on 30 October.b. The passage on help to the unemployed on page 3 of the draftSpeech will need to be looked at in the light of our decisions on therelevant public expenditure programme.1confidential
