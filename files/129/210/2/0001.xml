CONFIDENTIALHIS  OC U ME NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 525 August 1980COPY NO 81CABINETCOMPENSATION AND PRIVATISATION OF SHIPBUILDINGMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor1. I have seen in draft the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s paper(C(80) 51).2. I am bound to say that I regard it as an error to discuss the questionsof &quot;privatisation&quot; solely in connection with the alleged inequity of thecompensation terms.    The first is a question of policy which must ultimatelydepend on the desirability of separating and then selling assets now firmly inGovernment hands and has nothing inherently to do with the alleged inequity ofcompensation terms.    The second depends on the desirability of retrospectivelegislation which would benefit those shareholders who held on to their sharesin the hopes of such legislation but not those who sold their shares to cut theirlosses.    This means compounding the injustice to the latter group whilerewarding the former whose moral claim is no greater.    This glaringinjustice will be all the more formidable to defend since, in a great number ofcase8, the omelet cannot now be made to return to the egg shell at all.3. To introduce this legislation in the second Session of Parliament willset a very bad precedent in retrospective legislation indeed.    If it was to havebe en done at all it ought to have been done last year and included in ourElection Manifesto.H of St MLord Chancellor&apos;s Department5 August 1980CONFIDENTIAL
