DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 58 COPY NO        CJ  22 October 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGB A.MMESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. Cabinet decided on 10 July to keep public expenditure planj for1981-82 and later years within the totals announced in the March White Paper(Cmnd 7841) less the benefit from refunds of European Communitycontributions (CC(80) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2).    The separate paperC(80) 59 shows the importance of sustaining that decision.    Indeed, if itwere practicable, it would be helpful to reduce public expenditure furtherin 1981-82.2. But the prospects have deteriorated since July.    We foresaw thenthat cuts in other programmes would be needed to offset increased provisionfor nationalised industries, then put  470 million (this, and all otherfigures in this paper, are at late 1979 prices) over what was provided inthe March White Paper.    Subsequent developments show very largeprospective excesses over the March totals, of the order of  2.7 billionin 1981-82, and more in later years.    To offset these increases and getback to the March White Paper will now require larger and more difficultcuts in programmes, with serious difficulties, both practical and political.3. The main reasons for the increases, set out in table 1 are:i.  600 million more must be provided for the nationalisedindustries.    The July increase would have allowed specifically 1, 220 million for the industries in 1981-82.    They have now soughtexternal financing limits totalling over  2, 500 million.    I haveproposed in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (E)that their bids be scaled down to  1, 520 million, which is 300 million more than we allowed for in July.    In additionincreased provision of  300 million is needed in the Reserve fornext year, partly for the end-year flexibility scheme fornationalised industries.1SECRET
SECRETii. The changed prospects for unemployment, inflation andinterest rates indicate increased provision of perhaps  700 millionin 1981-82, and more in later year s, for benefits, housing subsidiesand export credit subsidies.iii. In view of the recent discussion in E Committee, we need toallow something for the proposals, originally amounting to 400 million, put forward by the Secretaries of State for Industryand Employment for &quot;seed-corn&quot; measures for industry andmeasures concerning unemployment, particularly for young people.The Annex to this paper provides for a net increase limited to 150 million.iv. An additional  550 million is needed in 1981-82 for anecessary increase in the Reserve, together with a reducedestimate for shortfall.v. Certain other smaller items require a further  250 million.4. To cover these increases we need both the specific cuts, as so fardiscussed in bilaterals with the Ministers concerned, and certain generalcuts which I now propose, affecting a large number of programmes. Theproposals in this paper need to be considered in conjunction with those inC(80) 60 concerning cash limits.    They concentrate on 1981-82. Figuresare also shown illustratively for 1982-83 and 1983-84 but the economicassumptions may need revision before the Budget and we can look at theseyears again when we have settled 1981-82.SPECIFIC CUTS5. Proposals for specific cuts are in the first column of Table 2:additional notes on some of the main ones are in the Annex.   In a few casesthe amounts have been reduced from what was suggested earlier in order toallow for the interaction with the general cuts described below. Bilateraldiscussions have led to agreement so far on only  0.2 billion of the 1 billion proposed.6. The difficulties, political, industrial, practical, of many of the cutsare evident.    Equally evident, to sustain our economic strategy and ourspecific commitment on public expenditure, we must make significant savingsin the very large as well as in smaller programmes.    This means movingaway from certain previous commitments, notably as to health, defence,education and social security.7. One key issue is social security, which accounts for a quarter oftotal public expenditure.    This is being considered separately.2SECRET
SECRET8. Defence is an area of special difficulty.    I respect the concern ofthe Secretary of State for Defence and others as to both national securityand relations with our North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies.    But thisis a very large programme, some 18 per cent of presently plannedprogrammes other than social security for 1980-81.    My proposal wouldmean that we had at least stopped the decline in defence spending whichoccurred under our predecessors, and that when most programmes arehaving to fall.   Significant increases for defence now need to be deferreduntil later in our period of office.GENERAL CUTS9. For the cash limit factor for expenditure other than pay the proposalin C(80) 60 is 11 per cent.    This will imply some degree of cash limitssqueeze if inflation turns out higher.    Eleven per cent is clearly withinthe realistic range of expectation, but requires the recent good performanceon prices to be continued.    Some moderate cash limits squeeze may yetstill be implied.10. Rather than reduce the cash limits factor further so as to producea deliberate major cash limits squeeze, I propose a general volume cutin all expenditures subject to cash limits (excluding local authority currentexpenditure) of 2 per cent in 1901-82, carried forward into the later years.The effect will be similar to that produced this year and last by the largecash limits squeeze.    It is preferable to doing it all again by such asqueeze: it enables programme managers to plan for it now, and thevolume figures published in the White Paper to represent more nearly theGovernment&apos;s intentions.11. In addition, I propose that we seek a further 1 per cent cut in localauthority current expenditure, in 1981-82, and in subsequent years, tc beshared out proportionately among the relevant programmes.    This involveschanging the earlier decision, announced in August to local authorities, tostick to the 2 per cent reduction between 1980-81 and 1981-82 shown in theMarch White Paper.    The extra reduction is required by the economicclimate and would be so explained.   It may not be implemented in full,especially in 1981-82, but we cannot exempt the local authorities from thisfurther effort.TOTAL EFFECT12. Table 2 shows the effects of these proposed reductions on the mainprogrammes,   other than social security.    The figures for later yearscarry forward the policy measures in the specific cuts, and the absoluteamounts of the general cuts.3SECRET
SECRETANNOUNCEMENT13. We have first to reach decisions on the substance, but need to keepin mind what will need to be said publicly and when.14. Specific announcements will be needed in the next month or so of:i. The additional cut intended in local authority currentexpenditure, which is relevant to the Rate Support Grant settlementnext month.ii. Cash limits factors.iii. The public expenditure policy assumed in the Industry Actforecast to be published in November.iv. Changes in some other programmes where operationallynecessary.15. It will be for consideration whether some announcement in generalterms about our overall plans will be useful in the near future. Subjectto that, the occasion for comprehensive and detailed announcement willbe the next public expenditure White Paper, which I propose we publishagain on Budget Day next spring. ,CONCLUSION16.

SECRETANNEXIMPLICATIONS OF MAIN CUTS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER1. Defence *XJi .     &apos;.  t jjd JL.As part of the specific cuts proposed in September, defence&apos;were asked fora contribution &quot;of the order of  ^00 million a year&quot;.   The additional 2% volumecut now proposed would mean for defence a further reduction of  188 million.Since a total cut of nearly  600 million is clearly not feasible, this has beenscaled down in the table to  500 million.   The Secretary of State for Defencevdll be concerned that cuts of that order, on top of previous cuts built intothe baseline, would damage operational capability and defence industrial capacity.2. EducationCabinet in July decided on cuts of  85 million next year, mainly inlocal authority current expenditure (on schools and further education) to achieveeducation&apos;s share of the 2% target reduction for local authorities. Sinceeducation is nearly half of local authority current spending, a further 61 million is needed towards the further ^% reduction;   and a 2% reduction inother programmes (universities, science) would yield a further   30 million.These cuts carried forward, with some further reductions, total (gross) 2*K) million a year for later years.   The Secretary of State will be concernedabout trebling the cut in his programme, when he regards what has already beenagreed as putting at risk the Queen&apos;s Speech commitment to &quot;maintain andimprove&quot; the quality of education.3. HealthFollowing decisions not to pursue fully a number of proposals for additionalcharges which had been made (notably charging for accident treatment) the programmeis already  100 million below current spending plans.   A further  126 million(2 per cent) cut in volume would mean a total reduction of  226 million belowpresent plans.   Unless Ministers are prepared to reconsider charging on thenecessary scale, gross NHS spending would have to be cut, not only below theplanned level arguably implied in the Manifesto commitment but in fact belowvolume spending in the current year.   Because of upward demographic pressures,this means an absolute reduction in level of service.-1-
k. ScotlandThe figures in the table show  90 million for specific cuts, plus  60 millionas the estimated &quot;formula&quot; cut to match the proposals for other programmes, givinga total of  130 million.   The Secretary of State was originally asked for 1^0 million plus &quot;formula&quot; cuts and regarded anything on this scale as politicallyunacceptable.   What is now proposed would still leave expenditure per capita inScotland on comparable programmes almost one third higher than in England.5. Home OfficeIn the last round of bilaterals, the Home Secretary reluctantly accepted acut of  10 million.   He has said that he is ready to accept a further cut of 30 million as his share of the percentage cuts now proposed.6. EnvironmentThe proposal is for specific cuts of a further  ^-3 million above the 65 million agreed earlier;   this would include in total  12 million for PSA.The percentage cuts would add another  69 million.   The PSA contribution is likelyto entail a reduction in departments&apos; accommodation programmes and standardsof service provided to them.SECRET
