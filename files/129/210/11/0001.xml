CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 61COPY NO 8124 October 1980CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT SETTLEMENT 1981-82Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentBACKGROUND1. TLe Cabinet agreed on 24 July on the totals of local authoritycurrent expenditure relevant for Rate Support Grant (RSG) purposes for1981-82 and on the totals for capital expenditure in the year(CC(80) 30th Conclusions, Minute 7).    This report, which has been preparedunder my chairmanship by a Group (MISC 21) of the Ministers directlyconcerned with local authority expenditure, makes recommendations forthe RSG settlement in 1981-82,    We invite Cabinet to endorse ourrecommendations for the method of grant distribution and to decide on thegrant percentage in the light of the decision on pay and price factors to beused in the cash limit.2. In England and Wales this marks the first year of the new system ofBlock Grant, and of separate grant settlements for the two countries. Thesystem is described briefly in Annex A.    For each authority a GrantRelated Expenditure (GRE) is defined and, as the authority&apos;s expenditureincreases beyond the GRE, the rate of grant support can be made to taperoff, leaving the authority to raise an increasing proportion of expenditurefrom its own ratepayers.    The basis of deciding how much an authorityneeds to spend (its GRE) is new, and this alone will produce large swingsin grant settlement this year.GRANT DISTRIBUTIONENGLAND3. We looked at the options for distribution against the backgroundthat, under the last Administration, there was a major and deliberate shiftof grant from &apos;shire&apos; counties to London which particularly benefited OuterLondon,    London&apos;s percentage share of total grant rose from 13.3 in 1975-76to 16. 7 in 1980-81, while that of the non-Metropolitan areas fell from 57.4to 53.6.    It follows that in reversing that trend Outer London as well asInner London will suffer losses.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.        Under all the options considered, the position of Metropolitanauthorities outside London, shire districts, and Inner London was broadlythe same.    The main differences lay in the balance between the shirecounties and Outer London,    Of the 5 options we examined we recommendwhat is known as Option 1 incorporating GRE B with per capita equalisation,10 per cent threshold, and 25 per cent constant taper.    These technicalitiesare explained in Annex A.    The local authority associations were consultedabout 3 options for defining GRE and GRE B was the preferred choice of theAssociation of County Councils.    In summary the grant changes under thisdistribution package from 1980-81 to 1981-82 are:-TABLE 1Non-	Metropolita	1	Metropolitan	Countie s	Districts	Total	Counties Districts	Total1.8p  67m	-0. 3p - llm	1. 5p  56m	l.lp       -2.

The details for each individuallocal authority are shown in Annex B; figures are still provisional at thisstage, but the overall pattern of the distribution is unlikely to be affected byfurther changes.5.        The system of defining GREs has been developed quickly, and theSecretary of State for Education and Science made clear that he still hasserious misgivings about some features.    But we agreed that in the timeavailable it would not be practicable to reopen the package, which formedthe basis of formal consultation.    Improvements will be looked for nextyear.    Meanwhile we recommend the option chosen as the most practicablefirst step in the right direction,2CONFIDENTIAL
confidential6. To keep the effects of grant changes within the bounds ofpracticability we have agreed also that ratepayers should be protected by asafety net system limiting the total grant loss of the authorities in any areato a maximum of 10p, and also that we should impose a limit on grant gainsof 7p.    We agreed that the Secretaries of State for the Environment and forWales should have some discretion to vary these limits, provided theymaintained consistency between countries.WALES7. The Welsh system will be operated separately from the English,and we have accepted the recommendation of the Secretary of State forWales that the distribution arrangements should be as summarised inAnnex C, which also shows the effect on individual local authorities inWales.    These arrangements are different in detail, though similar in theirbroad effect, to those in England.8. We further agreed that it would be right to retain the division ofoverall grant between England and Wales this year on the same percentagebasis as in previous years - ie 7.4 per cent to Wales.    A study will bemade before next year in the hope that the 1982-83 grant can be divided ona more satisfactory basis.CASH LIMITS AND GRANT PERCENTAGE9. The exemplification of the recommended distribution package inAnnexes B and C uses an overall grant percentage for England and Walesof 61 per cent (as last year - equivalent to 60 per cent in England and75 per cent in Wales) and an overall cash limit of 10^ per cent (8 per centfor new pay).    We need to consider whether to confirm or reduce the grantpercentage, and we need to bring the cash limit factors for pay and pricesinto line with those for the public services generally.10. There is a case for reducing the overall grant to 60 per cent.This would underline the Government&apos;s determination to cut localGovernment spending and give individual local authorities an additionalincentive to comply.   A reduction in the grant percentage would howeverbe likely to lead to rate increases additional to those which will come anyway,and will compound the presentational difficulties of introducing the newsystem and the criticism of it.   Notwithstanding grave doubts expressed inthe Group about the effect of lowering the grant percentage, we thought itright to put before Cabinet the option of a reduction to 60 per cent.11. A 1 per cent reduction in the grant percentage would be equivalent to2. 8p average extra change in rates for all English authorities, in additionto the changes brought about by the grant distribution.   A wider safety netwould be needed to allow the change to come through.    The effect on grantdistribution of the recommended option is:-confidential

The case for reducing the grant percentage must be seen in thecontext of a judgment on the effects of the cash limit chosen on localauthority rating decisions.    We therefore invited the Secretary of Statefor the Environment to estimat the likely impact on the rates of a cashlimit providing for an increase in pay and prices in line with that to beused elsewhere in the public services.   Pending decisions on this11 per cent has been used as a working assumption for prices and 8 per centor 6 per cent for new pay settlements between November 1980 and July 1981,and 6 per cent or 4 per cent for new pay settlements between August 1981and March 198?.    There are complications, depending on whether the newpay provision is assumed to include, or exclude, the &quot;overhang&quot; effect ofthe staged settlements for teachers, and also in deciding how to deal withthe police, who have previously been index-linked.OVERHANG13. The teachers received a staged settlement in September 1980 whichwill add to their pay bill between 1980-81 and 1981-82, independently of thenew pay they obtain in the 1981-82 pay round.    This issue is beingseparately considered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.But if it were decided to offset this &quot;overhang&quot; against the new payprovision, it would reduce the cash limit inflation factor by just over1 per cent.   However since this penalty would apply specifically to teachers,it would be necessary to adjust the distribution of grant, so as to reducesubstantially the allocation to education authorities as against others.INDEXATION14. If it were decided to make additional provision of 2 per cent to allowfor index-linking of police in 1981 mis would add 0.1 per cent to the cashlimit inflation factor.    There is a difficult point of presentation here.The allowance for police pay will be readily detectable from the cash limitof certain police authorities, particularly the Metropolitan police.    If theyreceive the &quot;standard&quot; provision (6 per cent or 4 per cent) for 1981-82pay round it will immediately be taken as evidence that the commitment toindexation based on past pay settlements has been .dropped.   We need todecide therefore whether or not to make an additional allowance, and how topresent this aspect of the settlement.4confidential

The Department of the Environment judge, on the basis of the pastbehaviour of the 457 local authorities in England and Wales in preparingtheir budgets and fixing rates, that they might rate on the basis of a figuresome way above the highest cash limit of 10. 5 per cent in Table 3 above.This is because they would err on the side of caution at every stage. Thepossible level of rate increases is   therefore as illustrated in the followingtable.TABLE 4Average domestic rate increases in 1981-82Grant	Cash Limit Inflation Factorpercentage	1980-81   to    1981-82 (from T	10|%   9l% 8l%61	16        17 1960	19        20 21(a) with a domestic rate increase of 16 per cent, the non-domestic rate rises would be 14 per cent.    With adomestic rise of 21 per cent the non-domestic rise wouldbe 18 per cent.5confidential
confidential(b) these averages would on past experience cover a very widerange (last year the average 27 per cent covered a range of11 per cent - 67 per cent).    This year the changes in grantdistribution are likely to lead to an even wider dispersion.17. These rate increases are well above what we want to see, and wemust influence authorities to budget and rate more tightly by, among otherthings, the content and presentation of the grant settlement.    To theextent that we can convince local government before mid-February that thecash limit factors are realistic, rate increases will be mat much lower.In terms of pay settlements, which are regulated centrally, our payassumption should be very influential.    We need to decide how far itshould be separately identified in announcing the settlement.GRANT PERCENTAGE AND DISTRIBUTION: SCOTLAND18. The grant in Scotland continues to be distributed on the previousbasis, and so the problems of changeover experienced in England andWales do not arise.    We recommend that the Secretary of State forScotland should be left to settle the detail of his distribution bilaterallywith the Treasury, once the overall grant, the cash limit, and the distribu-tion method in England have been decided.CONCLUSION19.      We therefore recommend that colleagues should agree on thefollowing points as the basis of the Rate Support Grant settlement for1981-82:-1,    The proposed method of distribution of RSG in England and Wales,and the share of grant between the two countries.(Paragraphs 3 - 8).ii.    Appropriate figures for overall grant percentage in thelight of the cash limit assumptions.   (Paragraphs 9 - 17).iii. Whether the pay assumption should be identified separatelyin the settlement (paragraph 17), and how the provision forfuture treatment of police pay groups should be presented.(Paragraph 14).iv. That the Secretary of State for Scotland and the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, should be left to agree appropriatefigures for Scotland to parallel those selected for Englandand Wales.

UNCLASSIFIEDANNEX AHOW THE BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM WORKS1. Block grant has the same overall objective as the previousRSG system - to enable authorities to provide a comparable servicefor a comparable rate poundage.   But it does this not through twoelements as formerly, but by a single grant payment bridging thegap between an authority&apos;s expenditure and the product of a specifiedrate poundage on its rateable resources.2. For each authority a bench-mark expenditure is defined by centralGovernment, called the &quot;grant related expenditure&quot; or GRE.   This isan assessment of the expenditure which that authority would be likelyto incur in providing a standard level of service.   To do this aformula is required to relate spending need to the characteristicsof that particular authority.   The formulae previously used to assessneed depended too much on past patterns of expenditure, so that highspending was built into the system.   The new system endeavours to moveaway from that.3*   The entitlement to grant is not open-ended:    as the authority&apos;sexpenditure increases beyond its assessed grant related expenditurethe rate of grant support can be made to taper off, leaving authoritiesto raise an increasing proportion of expenditure from their own rate-payers.   It will be for the ratepayers to express their views at thelocal election on whether they support well above average expenditureat increasing expense to themselves.   The level above GRE at whichthe taper starts to bite, and the severity and form of the taper canbe set each year in the light of circumstances.4.   Block grant thus aims to provide a link between grant andexpenditure for all authorities in such a way as to provide a fairand consistent incentive to economy.

CONFIDENTIALANNEX CTHE WELSH DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMRate Support Grant in Wales will be distributed under arrangementsdiffering from those in England but providing the same overall effect.There will be two formulae, one for Districts and one for Counties,to determine grant-related expenditure for each authority.    The formulaeare based on methodology developed jointly with the Welsh localauthorities over the past three years.    The basis is the client groupapproach, least dependent on past expenditure.2. The threshold in Wales will be the same as in England.    There willalso be similar arrangements for safety nets and limitation of grantgains.    The basis of equalisation, however, will be percentage ratherthan per capita and the Rate Poundage Schedule will be a non-linearcurve above the threshold with a power of 1.35: the effect of this isto increase the penalty as the degree of overspending increases.Rate Increases3. Welsh local authorities will take particular account of two1features of the settlement in fixing their rates.    The first is theeffective rate of grant support.    Because of the lower level ofrateable resources in Wales the effective rate is higher in Walesthan the corresponding England and Wales figure.   This gearing resultsin a proportionately larger reduction in the effective rate in Walesfor any given reduction in the England and Wales figure.   The effectiverate in Wales corresponding to 61% England and Wales is 74.9%, andcorresponding to 60% England and Wales is 73.7%.4.
