confidentialIjj. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 7112 November 1980COPY NO82CABINETTHE REMUNERATION OF JUNIOR MINISTERSIN THE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. When we discussed the pay of Ministers in July (CC(80) 26thConclusions and CC(80) 27 th Conclusions, Minute 4), much concern wasexpressed over the relatively poor salaries of Junior Ministers in the Houseof Lords (see Annex A).    In a statement to the House of Commons on7 July, the Prime Minister said:&quot;Junior Ministers in the House of Lords ... do not receive anysalary specifically in respect of their parliamentary duties.This is a very real problem, and we propose to consider howthe arrangements for their remuneration should be revised totake account of it. &quot;2. Officials were asked to report on the best way of dealing with thisproblem.    Their report is attached (Annex B).    They conclude that, ifadditional remuneration is to be paid, it should logically be paid to allMinisters and Office holders in the House of Lords; that it should beintroduced by means of an amendment to the Ministerial and Other SalariesAct 1975; and that the opportunity should be taken to amend this Act in otherways.THE CASE FOR MORE PAY3. I am convinced that Junior Ministers in the Lords should get moremoney, for the following reasons:-i. Present pay ( 16,400 for Ministers of State and  12, 500for Parliamentary Secretaries) bears no relation to the responsibility.There are some in real financial difficulties.ii. Lords Ministers have similar departmental duties toCommons Ministers but they also have to undertake a good deal ofwork in the Lords on behalf of other Departments.    I doubt thereis any significant difference in work-load between the two aftertaking account of constituency work for Commons Ministers.1confidential
confidentialiii. Lords Ministers who live elsewhere are obliged to spendthe week in London.    They get no help towards this.iv. When a Lords Minister relinquishes his post his salaryceases immediately whereas a similarly placed Commons Ministercontinues to receive his salary as an MP.    Even if defeated at anElection a former MP gets a severance grant equal to at least6 months&apos; full salary.v.       Junior Ministers in the Lords expect additional remunerationas a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement on 7 July.METHOD, AMOUNT AND SCOPE4. 1 accept the conclusion in the paper by officials that the best way toeffect an increase in remuneration is by an amendment to the 1975Ministerial and Other Salaries Act.    I also agree that a figure of  3, 500is about right (ie the equivalent of around half of a Commons Minister&apos;sParliamentary salary).5. I am mainly concerned to improve the remuneration of JuniorMinisters but do not dispute the logic in the official paper of making anincrease payable to all Ministers and Office holders in the Lords.    I wouldwelcome the views of colleagues on this point.    I for my part would foregoany such increase in my own salary as a Cabinet Minister at present.MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT CONSIDERATIONS6. The Bill to increase the remuneration of Lords&apos; Ministers could beused to deal with some anomalies in the 1975 Act which can - and have -constrained the freedom of Prime Ministers to determine the compositionand size of their Cabinets, as well as, if thought right, to make it possibleto pay increases in Ministerial salaries retrospectively.    The anomalies,and a suggested way of removing them, are discussed in the Appendices tnthe report by officials-     The inclusion of these provisions would have theincidental, but politically significant, effect of enabling us to present the Billprimarily as a machinery of government measure, with Lords&apos; Ministers&apos;pay as its secondary purpose.DIFFICULTIES7. I foresee two sources of difficulty.    The first is the timing of this interms of public opinion.    The second is the reaction of the House of Commons,whose members might be unhappy with legislation to increase the remunerationof Lords&apos; Ministers when their own pay has been restrained.8. We would also be further rejecting the recommendation of theTop Salaries Review Body.    If we are to proceed we should need to giveLord Boyle a full explanation, before any public announcement is made, ofwhy we feel it necessary to improve the lot of Lords&apos; Ministers.2confidential
confidentialCONCLUSION9* It will never be the &quot;right time&quot; to do this, but I believe that thearguments for going ahead are strong.    I therefore invite the Cabinet:-i.       To agree that Junior Ministers in the Lords should be givenadditional remuneration to the extent of  3, 500 per year and thatthis should be done as a matter of urgency by amending the 1975Ministerial and Other Salaries Act.ii.       To consider whether the additional remuneration should alsobe paid to other Ministers and Office holders in the Lords.iii. To agree that the opportunity should be taken to amend the1975 Act in other ways, permitting Ministerial salary increasesto be paid retrospectively and giving Prime Ministers greaterfreedom *o determine the composition and size of Cabinets.iv. To agree that the measure should be presented primarilyas a machinery of government Bill.C SCivil Service Department12 November 19803confidential

CONFIDENTIALANNEX BttVJhZRAilQK OF JUNIOR MINISTERS IN THE HOUSE C? LCJOSnote by OfficialsIntroduction*ine Governmen* hag decided that the remuneration of junior Ministerm vhe house of Lords should be revised to take account of theirparliamentary duties. * In her statement to the House of Comsocs on7# July (repeated by the Lord President in the Lords), the Prime  plaimster said:&quot;Although junior Ministers in the House of Lords now receive asecretarial allowance of  1,000, which we propose to increaseto  1,100 /now  1,1?57, they do not receive any salaryspecifically in respect of their parliamentary duties.    This isa very real problem, and we propose to consider how the arrange-ments for their remuneration should be revised to take accountof it.&quot;2.   This paper sets out the conclusions of a small group of officials,led by CSD, who were asked to consider the problem.    The group includedthe First Parliamentary Counsel, the Accountant of the House of Lordsand a representative of the Cabinet Office.    It deals first with thereasons for increasing the remuneration of Ministers in the House ofLordsi the recipients of the increase and the amount involved, andgoes on to consider possible methods of effecting the increase and thepresentational aspects.Reasons for additional remuneration3    Two distinct views can be taken of the reasons for increasing theremuneration of Ministers in the Lords.    The first is that, becausethey do not receive a parliamentary salary, unlike Commons Ministers,the total amount they are able to earn as Ministers is too low andinadequately compensates them for the loss of other earnings opportun-ities.   On this view the purpose of the additional payment is both toensure that existing Ministers are not penalised financially by theiracceptance of office and to ensure that Peers of ability are notdissuaded from becoming Ministers by low rates of pay. Additionalremuneration can in effect be seen as giving Lords Ministers the&quot;market rate&quot; for the job.4.   The other view is that Lords Ministers do certain types of work,which may be loosely described as &quot;Parliamentary duties&quot;, for whichthey are not at present remunerated, but ought to be.   The work Inquestion falls into two categories.   First, there is the job of speakingfor departments other than their own in the House of Lords, for whichthere is no equivalent in the Commons*   Second, there is the need todeal with correspondence from the public which the Top Salaries ReviewBody recognised when they recommended a secretarial allowance of  1,000for Lords Ministers in their Report No. 13*   This work may be broadlycompared with the constituency work of Commons Ministers but, unlikeCommons Ministers, those in the Lords receive no remuneration for whatthey do.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThese two views are not mutually exclusive but differentconclusions might be reached on the most appropriate way of detliwith the problem depending on which of them is taken as the pri:^.reason for increasing Lords lilinisters remuneration,    We have slideassumption that the Government is chiefly interested in ensuringthe total resjuneration of Lords Ministers is adequate (the firstThere would in fact be considerable difficulty in basing a case facross the board increase mainly on the existence of &quot;Parliaaentaduties&quot; because these duties fall unevenly between different KiniFor example some Ministers do a lot of work for departments otlisrtheir own, whereas others do relatively little.    Furthermore, itnot follow that Ministers who speak for several departments neceshave Bore onerous Parliamentary duties than those who speak onlyRecipients6.   The Prime Ministerfs statement referred to the remuneration ojunior Ministers in the Lords.   We presume that this should be tainclude Ministers of State, Parliamentary Secretaries, all GovernWhips and, possibly, the Lord Advocate.    There are however otherMinisters and paid office holders in the Lords, namely the LordChancellor, other Cabinet Ministers, the Leader of the OppositionOpposition Chief Whip&apos; and the Chairman and Principal Deputy ChairCommittees*   If it is accepted that the main reason for increasinremuneration is to ensure that the total income of Ministers is eto compensate them for loss of other earnings opportunities! thenargument applies to Cabinet Ministers as well as to others. Furtto increase the remuneration of Ministers not in the Cabinet onlyoverturn the pattern of relativities between different groups ofMinisters that the Government have hitherto thought appropriate,would be invidious to give additional remuneration to Ministersdeny it to non-Government office holders.   We would therefore recthat any increase in remuneration should be paid to all Ministerspaid office holders in the Lords.Amount7    Ministers in the Commons receive a Parliamentary salary of  6per annum.   We presume that the Government will wish to maintaindifference between the total remuneration of Lords and CommonsMinisters to take account of the constituency work performed by tlatter.   We consider that the additional remuneration for LordsMinisters might be around  3, 500, roughly half the Parliamentarysalary of Commons Ministers.Method8.   Broadly, there are four ways in which the pay of Lords Minismight be increased:a.   Using the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975* In pan Order could De drarted which listed in its scneauxe salfor Ministers which corresponded to the rates the Governmento pay to those in the Lords*   These rates would be treatedmaxima and Commons Ministers would in practice he paid so mHowever this would be in conflict with the spirit, if not tletter, of the 1975 Act which does not make provision for sLords and Commons salaries.   It would also be misleading assalaries quoted in the Order would not correspond to those .the majority of Ministers.   In any case, we understand thaproposal on this Ptu*tlcular point was put to Cabinet bySir Robert Armstrong ^^ f^^find favour with them*
CONFIDENTIALb. Amending the 1975 Act,     A new Act could permit differentsalaries to be p&apos;aid to Lords and Condons Ministers,    It could alsosolve some other problems of the present legislation,  for exampleby allowing retrospective payment of increases in Kinisterialsalaries.    An indication of further useful changes that Eight bemade is given in the annex to this paper.    However there are li&gt;:elto be problems of Parliamentary time and. possibly, a hostilereception by the House of Colons to any proposed legislationbenefiting Lords Ministers,c. Allowing Lords Mi n i sters to claim th e Tee rs&apos; expenses a lie v; ap cin full.    Between *y75 and early this year, i^eers who were ofTaTceholders were allowed to draw  700 per annum of Peers&apos; expenseallowance, of which  100 was tax free,    Report No.  13 of the TopSalaries Review Body recommended against the practice on the grou^that the payment was more in the nature of pay than reimbursementand was inconsistent with the system of categorising eligible itemsin the Peers* expenses allowance (ie into subsistence andsecretarial costs).   As an alternative the Review Body recommendedthat Lords Ministers should get a secretarial allowance up to amaximum of  1,000.      The Government accepted and implemented theserecommendations.    Quite apart from the inconsistency of theGovernment reversing its decision on Lords Ministers* allowanceswithin a few months, the argument of principle against treatingthe Peers* expenses allowance as a form of remuneration (andhence taxable) remains*d. Giving Ministers some other &quot;allowance&quot;.     There are two mainvariants to this option:i. Giving Lords Ministers the same sort of &quot;additional costsallowance&quot; as MPs.   Essentially this would mean allowingLords Ministers to claim reimbursement for the cost of asecond home outside London.   As an allowance for expensesactually incurred, this would only be payable to Ministerswho had to move to London on appointment, and not thosealready living or working in London.   It would hence beunsatisfactory as a means of increasing the remuneration ofall Lords Ministers*   A further objection is that MPs receivea second home allowance because they necessarily have to workin two places - Westminster and their constituency - whereasthis does not apply to Lords Ministers.ii. Creating a special and entirely new &quot;parliamentaryduties&quot; payment.   This would be in the nature of remunerationrather then reimbursement of expenses and would therefore bepayable to all Lords Ministers (despite the varying burden ofParliamentary duties as we define them in paragraphs.4 and 5above).   New allowances have been introduced by way ofresolutions in the past.   For example, the secretarialallowance for Lords Ministers was introduced in this way.However the propriety of increasing the pay of Lords Ministersas opnosed to reimbursing their expenses, without recourse tolegislation would be highly dubious.   The Ministerial andOther Salaries Act 1975 puts a limit on the remuneration ofMinisters.   Any attempt to increase this limit (whether ornot the increase was called an &quot;allowance&quot;) without amending_____. 1...CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Act would certainly be challenged in the Coronalirrespective of whether it vyas introduced by means of aresolution in that House.    The Government would have 6\iin putting forward a convincing defence.    If legislationrequired this option effectively becomes the same as optabove.9. Options (a) - using the 1975 Ministerial Salaries Act - and (callowing Lords Ministers to claim the Peers expenses allowance - aundesirable for the reasons given.    The choice therefore is bet.ve:-amending the 1975 Act and introducing one or other of the allcr.&amp;ncset out in (d).    The disadvantage of the first of these allowancaa(a second home allowance) is that it would not be payable to all LMinisters and that it would not be justified in terms of place ofThe second allowance would be an amendment of the  975 Act in allname and hence should not be introduced except by way of legislatiWe therefore recommend amending the 1975 Act.    This would have thefurther advantage that the power to make increases in Ministerialretrospective could be taken and some or all of the changes discus,in the annex could also be made.Presentation10. t7hatever means are used to increase the remuneration of LordsMinisters there will be difficult presentational problems. Althouthe argument that the total remuneration of Lords Ministers is toosmall in relation to their loss of earnings opportunities is quitetenable, it would be difficult to stress publicly. The case is likto rely to a significant extent on the argument that Lords Ministerperform duties over and above their normal departmental duties (orduties as Whips) for which they are remunerated. Unfortunately (apfrom the points made in paragraph 5) this argument is vulnerable tothe criticism that the Top Salaries Review Body have already specifconsidered the point* In their Report No. 12 (June 1979) the RevieBody said:&quot;The Parliamentary salary of Ministers and other paid officeholders in the House of Commons recognises their responsibilitas Members of Parliament, for their constituents as distinctfrom their Ministerial or other responsibilities;    a responsibthat is not borne by Members of the House of Lords. Consequenthe holder of an office in the House of Lords that is equivaleto an office in the House of Commons will be paid less becauseno Parliamentary salary is received.   The salary can only bethe same if, despite the equivalent nature of the job, it doesin practice carry a heavier responsibility or a greater worklceither directly or because additional duties are added to it.Where these have been identified we have made allowance for thin our recommendations.&quot;    (paragraph 29)Por the Government to give further increases to Lords Ministerstherefore would be to go directly against the Review Body&apos;s recommeation and is likely to be resented by MPs who have had their own parestrained*4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTax Position11.     Any additional remuneration for Lords Ministers would of eourssbe taxable.    The Inland Revenue advisa us that an allowance for thecost of a second home would also be taxable since Peers do not haveconstituency responsibilities.    In addition they have told us thatif the additional payment were described as being for &quot;parliamentaryduties&quot; the present tax-free treatment of Lords Ministers1 travelexpenses between their homes and VTestminster *ould be jeopardised.On the other hand if these payments were described as being forMinisterial duties the reimbursed travel expenses would not be injeopardy.Conclusion12.    i&quot;e recommend that,  if additional remuneration is to be paid, it3hould be paid to all Ministers and office holders in the House ofLords;    that it should be introduced by means of an amendment to theMinisterial and Other Salaries Act 1975;    and that the opportunityshould be taken to amend this Act in other ways.   We suggest that asum of around  3,500 might be an appropriate amount.16 September 19805CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX IOTHER POSSIBLE ASSgS&amp;XENTS TO THE MINISTERIAL AND OTHERSALARIES ACT 19751.    If legislation were introduced to s--nend the 1975 Act so asto deal with the pay of Ministers in the Lords, the opportunitycould also be taken to give the Prime /Minister greaterflexibility in determininga. the composition; andb. the sizeof the Cabinet.COMPOSITION OF THE CABINET2.   Schedule 1 of the Act assumes that Prime Ministers willalways include certain Ministers in their Cabinets,    As a result,the Schedule provides for the holders of these named offices onlyto receive a Fart I salary:    they cannot he paid under any otherpart of the Schedule.    In addition to the Premiership itself,these named offices are:i. Chancellor of the Excheo^uer;ii. All Secretaries of State;iii. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood.3. This arrangement can cause difficulties.   For example:i. In the last Labour Government, because the size ofthe Cabinet exceeded the limit on the number ofPart I salaries that may be paid, Mr John Silkincould not receive a Part I salary;    and becausethere is no provision to pay the Minister ofAgriculture at any other rate, Mr Silkin couldnot be paid a Part II salary either.ii. In the present Government, the limit on the numberof Part I salaries would again have been exceededif Mr Norman Fowler had been appointed Secretary ofState for Transport;    and as a Secretary of Statehe could not have been paid at any other rate.The title of his office had to be changed, therefore,to &quot;Minister of Transport&quot; and he had to be excludedfrom the Cabinet so that he could be paid a Part IIsalary.4, Comparable difficulties do not arise in the case of otheroffices whose holders are often but not invariably included inthe Cabinet and about which the 1975 Act makes no assumption.The Act provides that the holders of the following offices mayreceive a Part I salary so long as they are members of theCabinet and a Part II salary if they are not included in theCabinet.   The offices are:CONFIDENTIAL

Parliamentary Seer	etary to	the Treasury	Minister of State		I     difficulties of the kind mentioned in paragraph 3 above^ip-ht be avoided in future if the offices of the Secretary o2*gts and Minister of Agriculture were treated in the 3an:e v.the offices listed in paragraph 4 above.    This might be d&apos;w amending Schedule 1 of the 1975 Act:a.     to add &quot;Minister in charge of a public department&quot;to the list in Part I (so avoiding any further neeto make express mention of the Minister ofAgriculture); andb#     to provide that Secretaries of State and Ministerscharge of public departments shall be eligible forPart I salary for so long as they are members of thCabinet and for a Part II salary for so long as theare not.; . ,Appendix II  illustrates what changes might be required toParts I and II of Schedule I if this approach were adopted.THE SIZE OP THE CABINET6.   Part V of Schedule I to the 1975 Act imposes limits on thnumber of Ministerial salaries&apos; that may be paid in total andunder the various Parts of the Schedule.   In particular, itspecifies that not more than 21 salaries may be paid at thePart I rate.   This effectively limits the size of the Cabinetto 22 (ie the 21 who may receive Part I salaries plus the LorChancellor, for whose salary provision is made separately)unless some Cabinet Ministers are to be paid no salary at all(eg Mr John Silkin);   and it can lead to the exclusion from tCabinet of Ministers who might otherwise have been included(eg Mr Norman Fowler).   If it were considered that PrimeMinisters should have greater flexibility in determining thesize of their Cabinets, this might be achieved:a. either by amending Schedule V to specify a higherbut fixed upper limit on the number of Part I salarorb. by providing that the upper limit may be varied frotime to time by order subject to affirmative resolujjj while Parliament might regard it as reasonable to give Pr&apos;Cabi ters greater flexibility in determining the size of theiJin i?e*8  it might be less willing to provide scope for increiThi total number of Ministers to whom salaries may be paid]cbaJ* may suggest that any amendment should be confined to^ging the limit on the number of Part I salaries.September I98OCONFIDENTIAL
