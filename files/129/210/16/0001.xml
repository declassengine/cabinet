restrictedyCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 66 ft?COPY NC II   h5 November 1980CABINETEUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Departmentand the Secretaryoof .State for&apos;Foreign and Commonwealth AffairsINTRODUCTION1.        The United Kingdom&apos;s declarations of acceptance of the optionalclauses of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provide forthe right of individuals to petition the European Commission of Human Rightsand the acceptance by States parties of the compulsory jurisdiction of theEuropean Court of Human Rights, expire on 14 January 1981. Thismemorandum seeks our colleagues&apos; agreement to announcing that we havedecided to renew the declarations for a period of five years*BACKGROUND2. In 1966 the United Kingdom accepted, under Article 25, the right ofany person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals to makea complaint direct to the Human Rights Commission in Strasbourg, and,under Article 46, the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court ofHuman Rights in all matters concerning the interpretation and application ofthe Conventions    Both articles enable a State to make these acceptances fora specific period.    The United Kingdom&apos;s initial acceptance in each case wasfor 3 years and has subsequently been renewed variously for periods of 2,3 and 5 years.3. Of 20 States parties to the Convention, 14 (4 indefinitely) - including allthe members of the European Community (EC) except France - have acceptedthe right of individual petition and 17 (3 indefinitely) - including all ECmembers - the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.    States parties otherthan France which have not accepted the right of individual petition are:Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Spain and Turkey.DOMESTIC CONSIDERATIONS4,        Since the United Kingdom accepted the optional clauses there has, in anumber of relevant Departments, been growing concern about the dynamic andevolutionary interpretation which the Strasbourg organs (particularly theCommission) have put on the Convention.    The effect of this has been to gofurther towards interfering with the exercise of Parliamentary sovereignty1restricted
RESTRICTEDthan could have been foreseen in 1951 when we ratified the Convention. Thedecisions reached by these organs highlight the extent to which the acceptanceof international obligations may often have the unavoidable consequence oflimiting the freedom of action of national bodies, whether legislative orjudicial.    The Convention was designed primarily to check excesses such ashad occurred in Europe daring the 1930s and 1940s under the authority cfnational laws.    It has, however, been applied in ways which were not withinthe intentions, 80 far as they can be discovered, of the drafters of theConvention.5. Withdrawal of the right of individual petition and from compulsoryjurisdiction would not, of course, alter what has already happened andwould protect us from difficulty and embarrassment only in future years.The extent of possible future difficulty and embarrassment is, in partbecause of the relative unpredictability of the interpretative approach alreadydescribed, impossible to assess at all reliably.    Nevertheless, some of theresults of earlier cases, and some of the cases which are currently underconsideration or in prospect, give ground for anxiety.    The areas affectedinclude the interception of communications, immigration and, potentially,nationality, police procedures, penal law and treatment, corporal punishmentin State schools and, potentially, military discipline (see Annex).6. A decision not to renew, however, could only be defended publicly ongrounds such as those described in paragraph 4 above.    Critics would attackany such argument on the basis that we were paying only lip service to theConvention and avoiding its obligations.    We have   accepted the optionalclauses continuously since 1966.   A refusal to renew would be stronglyopposed and could not easily be reconciled with our Manifesto commitmentto discuss a possible Bill of Rights.    It would have potentially seveiepolitical consequences in Northern Ireland where critics would representit as an implicit admission that arrangements there could not be justifiedin the Strasbourg organs, and make adverse comparisons with the Republic,which has accepted indefinitely the right of individual petition.INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS7. The United Kingdom was one of the principal architects of theConvention and has always taken justifiable pride in its long standingcommitment to human rights.    The fact that we have accepted the additionalcommitments inherent in making declarations under Articles 25 and 46 givesus a tactical advantage in our relations with the Communist bloc and othercountriep, for example in Latin America, who infringe human rights. Adecision not to renew the optional clauses, particularly during the impendingreview of the Helsinki Final Act, would be criticised by our Europeanpartners and the United States, and also (for differing reasons) by EasternEurope.      The United Kingdom has been able to defend its position on thecorresponding provisions in the United Nations Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights (ie non-ratification) by reference to our acceptance of theright of individual petition in the European Convention which coversessentially the same ground and whose organs adopt a more judicial approachin the matters referred to them.2RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDPERIOD OF RENEWAL.8. Renewal could be for a shorter period than five years, but in theabsence of convincing arguments such a course would merely raise doubtsabout the United Kingdom support for human rights.    There is also anoption of indefinite renewal, which has recently been canvassed in the Press,,This option has the attraction of providing conclusive evidence of oursupport for international measures for protecting human rights and wouldbe seen by some at least as a safeguard for the future.    But it is open tothe very serious objection that, if in the future we were faced withunacceptable adverse judgments at Strasbourg, the Convention contains noprovision for withdrawing from the commitment, and it is uncertain whetherit could be withdrawn (even if the declaration itself referred to thatpossibility).    There is also the problem whether it would be politicallyfeasible to withdraw from a commitment which we had once accepted for anindefinite period and in respect of which there would be no naturalopportunity for review.    Lastly, it may be salutary for the Strasbourgorgans not to be in a position wheie they can count on United Kingdomacceptance into the indefinite future.    Only four States (Iceland, Ireland,the Netherlands and Sweden) have made indefinite declarations underArticle 25.    Renewal for five years seems best and would have theadditional advantage of avoiding the need to look at the question again duringthe run up to the next General Election.CONCLUSION9. For the reasons set out above we consider that the arguments,both domestically and internationally, for renewal for five years outweighthe arguments against this course.     Accordingly we invite our colleaguesto agree that the United Kingdom&apos;s acceptance of Articles 25 and 46 shouldbe renewed for a further period of five years from January 1981, and thatthe decision should be announced in Parliament in reply to an arrangedQuestion.W WCHome Office5 November 1980RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDANNEXSome significant areas affected by earlier cases at Strasbourg and &quot;bycases currently under consideration or in prospectInterception of communications.   An adverse judgement in the case ofMalone, which relates to telephone tapping in the case of a suspectedreceiver of stolen goods, could be most damaging.Immigration and, potentially, nationality.   The Commission&apos;s decisionspose a real threat to aspects of our policy.Police procedures.   Including dealing with suspected terrorists.Penal law and treatment.   Including sexual offences in Northern Irelandand procedures relating to the control of mentally disordered offenders.Corporal punishment in State schools.Military discipline.   The Ministry of Defence is concerned about the potentialimplications of the Convention in the field of military discipline, havingregard in particular to the European Court&apos;s judgement in the Dutch Soldiers Case(1976)    In the worst case an adverse judgement which directly affected theUnited Kingdom could have a serious impact on the summary powers of commandingofficers and this in turn could impair the operational efficiency of the ArmedForces.   When the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which has broadlysimilar provisions) was ratified by the United Kingdom in 1976 a reservationwas entered in respect of military discipline.   It would not be legally possibleto exempt any particular area of difficulty from the scope of the renewal ofour acceptance of the right of individual petition (as has been suggested bythe Ministry of Defence).
