SECTION I: INTRODUCTION1.1 In accordance with the undertaking given by the Lord Privy Sealin the foreword to the White Paper on Developments in the EuropeanCommunities January-December 1979, this White Paper resumes the usualsix monthy report; it covers the period of the Italian Presidency fromJanuary-June 1980.1.2 The period under review was dominated by the search for andculminated in a solution to a pressing internal problem of far-reachingsignificance: the United Kingdom&apos;s excessive net contribution to theCommunity Budget.1.3 A two part framework for an acceptable solution was establishedat the European Council in Dublin on 27/30 November last year. First, the1975 Financial Mechanism, which had so far provided no relief whatsoever,would be amended so as to yield a refund sufficient to bring the UnitedKingdom&apos;s share of the Community&apos;s contributions into line with its sharein Community GNP. Second, the Community would consider measures toincrease its expenditure in the United Kingdom. The Commission developedthis approach further in two documents, 4845/80 and COM(80) 147. Theseproposed that the Community should help to finance programmes of publicexpenditure in the United Kingdom designed to improve the country&apos;seconomic infrastructure and thereby to forward the Community&apos;s aim ofpromoting a convergence of economic performance within its boundaries.1.4 Community Finance Ministers agreed that this approach couldform the basis for an acceptable solution when they met on 21 Aprilalthough the amount and duration of the relief remained to be decided. Attheir meeting in Luxembourg on 27/28 April Heads of Government recog-nised, at least in respect of 1980 the scale of relief necessary. For the firsttime, the rest of the Community was prepared to discuss the problem in termsof the net contribution which it was reasonable to ask the United Kingdomto pay, rather than the size of the rebate which might be provided.1.5 These were considerable steps forward and paved the way for thesettlement reached at the Foreign Affairs Council on 30 May. In brief,the agreement provides a rninimum rebate of  1,5700 million in respect ofthe 1980 and 1981 Budgets. This reduces the United Kingdom&apos;s estimatednet contribution to those Budgets by about two thirds. There is also a risk-sharing formula which protects the United Kingdom from a dramaticincrease in its net payments to the Community if the Commission&apos;s estimatesof its unadjusted net contributions are exceeded.1.6 The settlement also provides for a far-reaching review of the wholeoperation of the Community Budget. If this review has not by 1982 pro-duced a permanent solution to the problem the Community will apply fora further year arrangements on the lines of the 1980 and 1981 solution. Thetext of the agreement is given at Annex III. When the Lord Privy Sealgave details of it to the House of Commons on 2 June, he said O Converted at the rate of 1-65 eua =  15
&quot;In the long term, the most important part of the package is thecommitment of the Council to review the development of Communitypolicies and the operation of the Budget. This, together with therestraints imposed by the 1 per cent ceiling will enable us to press forlasting reforms, which will, among other things, resolve the Britishbudgetary problem. This review offers an opportunity that has neverbeen available before, since we joined the Community, to work togetherwith our partners for financial arrangements and Community policiesthat are to the advantage and interest of all the Member States as befitsa Community of equals.&quot;1.7 The 30 May agreement thus transforms the prospect facing theUnited Kingdom in its financial relations with the rest of the EuropeanCommunity. Britain&apos;s budgetary position is now safeguarded for at leastthree years, and the Community is pledged to undertake the longer termreforms required to avoid a recurrence of the problem. More generally, theagreement demonstrates that the Community is capable of acting to accom-modate the grievances of one of its members and of adapting and developingits policies to changing needs; it is a striking example of the way in which,by persistent and diligent negotiation, the United Kingdom can help tomake the Community an effective vehicle of the aspirations of Europe asa whole.1.8 There is also a growing recognition that the rate of increase inexpenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) needs to be con-tained. The Community is now committed to restructure its Budget by1982. France and Germany will also be contributing substantially more tothe Community budget and therefore to the costs of the CAP. Together,these factors enhance the prospects for improving the operation of the CAP,particularly by restraining surplus production and thus cutting costs. Thisyear&apos;s price fixing, even taking account of green rate changes, has led to anaverage increase in support levels below the average rate of inflation.1.9 The Government remains committed to a satisfactory overall settle-ment of the revised Common Fisheries Policy at an early date. TheGovernment accordingly welcomed the commitment by all Member States ina Council Declaration of 30 May 1980 to negotiate, in the appropriateforum a settlement by the end of 1980 at the latest, and the identificationin the Declaration of all the aspects considered by the Government asessential elements of the overall final agreement.1.10 The period also saw considerable activity in Political Co-operationlargely because of events in Afghanistan and Iran, and growing tensionsin the Middle East. During this period Foreign Ministers of the Nine metin the Political Co-operation framework on average more than once amonth they were also in frequent touch with each other bilaterally and inother fora.1.11 Negotiations on Spanish and Portuguese entry, which the Govern-ment firmly support, have made steady progress. The prospect ofenlargement will need to be taken fully into account in consideration ofthe changes which will be necessary in the Community in the next few years.6
1.12 The Government welcome the attention which the Communityhas paid in the current international climate to relations with Yugoslavia,Turkey, Romania and the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN). Negotiations on agreements with each of these were successfullycompleted. The Government also welcome the agreement in principlewhich has been reached on Zimbabwe&apos;s accession to the Lome&quot; Convention,and the strengthening of ties with Latin America.1.13 The Government welcome the coming into force on 1 January1980 of the agreements reached in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations andare looking for a full and committed implementation of the new GATTAgreements by all the signatories. The Government will continue tosupport efforts to examine possible barriers to trade within and outside theCommunity.1.14 Recent discussion of energy in the Community has recognised theneed to develop policies aimed at a reduction in dependence on importedoil, the development of alternative sources of energy (in particular coal andnuclear) and the conservation and rational use of energy. The Commissionhas put forward ideas for a Community energy programme, aspects of whichit is examining further with Member States.1.15 In the field of transport, discussions have continued on proposalsfor a regulation enabling the Community to assist infrastructure projects ofCommunity interest. The Government welcome further talks on this matter,although there are a number of important questions which remain to beresolved before agreement can be reached on the draft regulation.SECTION II: POLITICAL CO-OPERATIONAfghanistan2.1 The Nine voted together at the United Nations in support of theresolution calling for a withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.They set out their own position further in a statement on 15 January, whichcondemned the Soviet invasion, called for a withdrawal of Soviet troops,and expressed grave concern at the USSR&apos;s violation of the basic principlesof international relations.2.2 Foreign Ministers discussed the Afghan situation again on 19February and, at a suggestion by the United Kingdom, launched theproposal that a solution could be found which would allow Afghanistan toreturn to its traditional neutrality and non-alignment. This proposal by theNine has since received widespread international support.2.3 The Nine Heads of Government discussed Afghanistan at bothApril and June European Councils. In their public statements they endorsedthe Foreign Ministers&apos; proposal for a neutral and non-aligned status for712745 c*
Afghanistan and made clear their continuing condemnation of Sovietoccupation. They drew attention to the genuinely national character of theresistance by the Afghan people and underlined the fact that the Sovietmilitary occupation of Afghanistan threatens to jeopardise the climate ofinternational relations for a long time.Iran2.4 Throughout the period the Nine emphasised their continuingconcern at the detention of United States diplomats as hostages in Iran.On 10 April the Ministers met in the margins of a Council of Europemeeting in Lisbon and agreed that they should recall their Ambassadorsfrom Tehran for consultations. Following these consultations the Ministersagreed at a meeting on 22 April on a series of measures against Iran to betaken in two phases, as a demonstration of solidarity with the United Statesand to maintain pressure on the Iranian authorities.2.5 The first phase included a number of measures which could beimplemented immediately, such as restrictions on sales of arms and relatedtechnology, reduction of staff in diplomatic missions in Iran, and the intro-duction of a visa requirement for Iranian nationals.2.6 The second phase involved the implementation of economicsanctions, if no decisive progress towards the release of the hostages hadbeen made before the informal meeting of Community Foreign Ministerson 17-18 May in Naples. At their meeting in Naples Ministers decided toapply sanctions. The United Kingdom Government applied sanctions underthe Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 and the Iran(Temporary Powers) Act 1980.2.7 Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers who discussed thehostage crisis at the European Councils in April and June have made clearthat they have no quarrel with the Iranian people, but cannot condone thisserious breach of international law.Middle East2.8 A major development in the Nine&apos;s position on the Middle Eastwas registered at the Venice European Council at which the Heads ofGovernment made a full statement of their position on the conflict in theMiddle East. They underlined that any settlement must be founded on twoprinciples: the right to existence and to security of all States in the region,including Israel; and the need for justice for all peoples of the region,which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.A comprehensive settlement requires that all the parties should respectthese principles.2.9 The European Council also decided to make contact with all theparties to explore the possibilities for practical progress towards a compre-hensive settlement on the basis of the principles outlined above. In thelight of these contacts the Nine will determine whether there is scope for afurther initiative on their part.8
South East Asia2.10 The second European Community (EC)/ASEAN (Association ofSouth East Asian Nations) Ministerial meeting took place in Kuala Lumpuron 6-7 March. Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN Member States andForeign Ministers of Member States of the European Community exchangedviews on regional and international problems and developments since themeeting in Brussels in November 1978. Their joint statement expressedconcern at Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia and Soviet military inter-vention in Afghanistan and called for a complete withdrawal of foreignforces from Cambodia and Afghanistan.Common Judicial Area2.11 Ministers of Justice of the Nine have not yet reached agreementon the draft Convention on Co-operation in Criminal Matters dealing mainlywith extradition arrangements among the Nine. The draft is being recon-sidered to see if a way can be found to resolve the outstanding problems.SECTION III: ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS,TRADE AND AIDEnlargement3.1 Progress continued to be made in the negotiations on the termsof Spanish and Portugese entry into the Community (a Treaty of Accessionwas signed with Greece in 1979 and Greece will join the Community on1 January 1981). The first phase of the substantive negotiations with Spainand Portugal, aimed at identifying the points of difficulty which will needdetailed negotiation in the next phase, was largely completed though discus-sions on agriculture, fisheries and Euratom are continuing.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): Multilateral TradeNegotiations (MTNs)3.2 The majority of the agreements, which the Community and othermajor developed country participants signed on 17 December 1979, cameinto force on 1 January. The Community is well advanced in implementa-tion of them, and has adopted a vigorous role in the various Committeesof Signatories set up to consult on any matters relating to the operation ofthe agreements. Discussions have continued, outside the framework ofthe MTNs, on the unresolved issue of a safeguards code, and are still goingon. The Community has also been active in furthering the introductionof an agreement to discourage trade in counterfeit goods, which it is hopedwill be signed later this year.Textiles3.3 Under the terms of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement bilateral agree-ments with low-cost supplying countries, a total of eight new quotas on
clothing products were made effective from 1 January. A further 3 quotason clothing have been introduced up to 30 June, together with one on woolcloth from Uruguay. The voluntary restraint arrangement which theCommunity made with Greece in 1979 has been extended to cover 1980.Synthetic Textiles3.4 During 1979 there was a sharp rise in imports of certain man-made fibre products from the United States of America. The Commissioninitially set up a Working Group in which the United Kingdom played anactive role and concluded that United States synthetic fibre producers gaina competitive advantage as a result of the United States Government controlson the price of oil and natural gas.3.5 It was subsequently decided that the EC should engage in consul-tations with the United States under Articles XXIII and XXI of the GATTin order to establish a mutually agreed interpretation of the level ofadvantage and its trade effects. To date no agreed conclusions have provedpossible and the discussions are continuing. In the meantime, the UnitedKingdom Government applied in February for controls on United Kingdomimports of those textile products. This request was acceded to in respectof two of the products and controls are now in operation. The Govern-ment are continuing to monitor the situation in other areas. The UnitedStates and Canada, who are most affected by the restrictions, have soughtcompensation under the GATT and a mutually agreed solution is expectedvery shortly.Turkey3.6 Negotiations on relaunching the Community&apos;s Association Agree-ment with Turkey were successfully completed on 30 June. Turkey willobtain agricultural concessions, certain improvements in the terms forTurkish migrant workers, and a financial package worth a total of 675million European units of account (MEUA) (about  409 million)Q.Japan3.7 The six-monthly Commission-Japanese High Level Consultationstook place in Tokyo from 19 to 21 May, when attention was drawn to thedangers created by the worsening trend in Japan&apos;s balance of paymentssurplus with the Community.China/Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)3.8 China was admitted to the EC&apos;s scheme of generalised tariffpreferences (GSP) on 1 January. Some industrial and agricultural productsare, however, excluded from GSP benefit, and others are subject to specialrestrictions.C1) Converted at the rate of 1-65 eua =  110
Yugoslavia3.9 The Community signed an agreement with Yugoslavia on 2 April,which covers trade, migrant labour and financial co-operation. 200 MEUA(about  121 million)^) will be available to Yugoslavia over 5 years in theform of low interest loans from the European Investment Bank.Mediterranean3.10 A protocol extending the existing agreement with Cyprus until theend of 1980 was signed on 7 February.3.11 The first meetings of the Co-operation Councils set up under theCommunity&apos;s agreements with Egypt and Lebanon were held on 21 Apriland 6 June.European Free Trade Area (EFTA)3.12 Negotiations were concluded with most EFTA countries onprotocols adapting the present agreements to take account of Greece&apos;sentry.Romania3.13 An EC/Romania Industrial Products Agreement (IPA) was con-cluded in June following an initialling of the main provisions in March. AJoint Commission Agreement (JCA) also was initialled in February. Thesetwo agreements represent the culmination of negotiations begun in February1979 and will take effect from 1 January 1981.3.14 The IPA is intended to develop trade and economic relationsbetween the Community and Romania and recognises the importance ofindustrial products in the expansion of trade. The JCA establishes a JointCommittee which will meet, normally annually, to monitor and discuss thedevelopment of trade.North/South Dialogue3.15 Community co-ordination has been pursued on North/Southmatters, including the Common Fund, the new International DevelopmentStrategy and preparations for the forthcoming round of United NationsGlobal Negotiations. At the final session of the Common Fund NegotiatingConference, held in Geneva from 5 to 28 June, agreement was reached onthe text of the Treaty which will bring the Fund into operation.Latin America3.16 The Foreign Ministers of Andean Pact countries (Venezuela,Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia) met Community Ministers in Brusselson 5 May.  This was followed by a first round of negotiations in Brussels(&apos;) Converted at the rate of 165 eua =  1.11
on 16-17 June on a non-preferential agreement between the Community andthe Andean Pact.3.17 Negotiations on a non-preferential agreement between the Com-munity and Brazil were concluded on 18 April and it is due to be signedin September.India3.18 A mandate for the Commission to negotiate a new commercialco-operation agreement was agreed in April. Negotiations with the Indiansopened on 6 June.ASEAN3.19 At the EC/ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur on6-7 March, an agreement on economic and commercial co-operation, thefirst such agreement between the Community and a group of developingcountries, was signed. The first meeting of the Joint Commission, set upunder the agreement, will be held in Manila in the Autumn.Lome Convention3.20 The annual meeting of the Joint EC/African, Caribbeanand Pacific Group of States (ACP) Council of Ministers was held in Nairobion 8-9 May. It reviewed the working of the first Lome Convention (whichexpired on 29 February) and looked forward to the entry into force laterthis year of the second Convention.3.21 Zimbabwe&apos;s accession to the Lome Convention was agreed inprinciple at the Nairobi Council. Negotiations on the terms of her accessionopened on 26 June.Agricultural Exports to the USSR3.22 On 15 January, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed not to replacethose agricultural products denied to the USSR by the US embargo, whileallowing &quot; traditional levels of trade &quot; to continue. In line with this decision,the Commission has taken steps to restrict exports of certain products, inparticular wheat, beef and butter. The Government have pressed consis-tently in the Community for an end to all subsidised food exports to theUSSR.Anti-Dumping Countervailing3.23 A new Community Regulation came into force on 1 Januaryreflecting the results of the 1979 GATT Agreements and the opportunity wasalso taken to clarify some of the existing rules and procedures. It ensuresthat Community legislation conforms with the new Agreement on the imple-mentation of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the GATT which deal withsubsidies and countervailing measures and the consequential amendments tothe existing Agreement on the implementation of Article VI (the Anti-Dumping Code).12
Community Trade - the Role of Standards and Certification Procedures3.24 The Commission is continuing to maintain an active interest in therole of standards and certification procedures in intra-Community trade andthe Working Party formed under the Chairmanship of the United Kingdomto examine the extent to which intra-Community trade is subject todistortion due to certification approval and testing procedures has nowcompleted its work.3.25 The report recommends that where immediate and pressingproblems arise which in the first place only affect 2 or 3 Member Statesthese problems should be dealt with initially on a bilateral or trilateral basis.To facilitate the creation of such arrangements the report recommends thata contact point should be set up in each Member State for this purpose.The report also emphasises the need for a greater output of harmonisedstandards from the European standards bodies and recommends that theCommission should keep continually under review its programme on direc-tives and accord priority to those directives for products where it can beclearly confirmed that substantial technical barriers to trade presently exist.The report will be presented to the Directors General for Industry at theirnext meeting.Food Aid3.26 Discussion of the Commission&apos;s proposals for new managementprocedures for Community food aid which we strongly support, continues.3.27 Agreement has been reached on the 1980 food aid programmes,comprising 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals, 150,000 tonnes of skimmed milkpowder, 45,000 tonnes of butteroil and 6,200 tonnes of sugar. In theseprogrammes it is increasingly necessary to provide assistance for (naturaland man-made) emergencies; for example, to help ease the plight of refugeesin East Africa alone, we have spent  4 million out of our total UnitedKingdom expenditure on national and Community food aid actions whichamounts to some  40 million a year.3.28 Agreement has also been reached on a new Food Aid Convention(1980) designed to ensure, perhaps with further members, a flow of 10million tonnes of cereals food aid a year to developing countries even whenworld supplies are short and prices high. Under this new Convention theCommunity have agreed to raise their food aid in cereals to 1,650,000 tonnesof which for 1981, the United Kingdom will provide as national actions117,000 tonnes in addition to paying a share of the Community&apos;s actions of924,000 tonnes.13
SECTION IV: AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESThe Common Agricultural Policy Price Fixing4.1 The Commission&apos;s proposals for common prices in 1980-81 andrelated measures were presented in February and a settlement was reachedat the Agriculture Council on 28-30 May, subject at the time to agreementon the Budget problem and associated matters.4.2 For milk a 4 per cent increase was partly offset by an increasein the co-responsibility levy, giving a net increase of 2.5 per cent; it wasalso agreed that a supplementary levy would be introduced in 1981-82if production expands by more than 1.5 per cent this year. The UnitedKingdom secured a contribution of full Community financing for the buttersubsidy which is worth  108 million to our consumers.4.3 For beef the guide price was raised by 4 per cent; variablepremiums in the United Kingdom were retained; and agreement wasreached on a new suckler cow subsidy.4.4 For sugar the beet price was increased by 4 per cent.4.5 For the main cereals there were increases of 4.5 per cent inintervention prices. The Council agreed to bring rye within the interventionsystem for feed grains. In the past a higher intervention price has beenpayable for rye. Alignment of the prices will be spread over three years.The Council also agreed to reduce production refunds on starch by 16 percent. These last two measures are designed to reduce CAP expenditure.The United Kingdom secured a commitment that the levy refunds onCommunity cereals used in exported whisky, including arrears back to1973, will be paid.4.6 The average increase in common prices which was agreed wasabout 5 per cent. Taking account of all changes in green rates since thelast price-fixing, the overall average increase in the support level is lessthan the average rate of inflation in the Community. The impact of theagreement on food prices will be about 0.7 per cent when all the effectshave worked through. This is equivalent to 0.15 per cent in the retailprices index.4.7 Under the price fixing settlement, the Council also agreed toimplement certain structural measures proposed by the Commission. Newregulations were adopted in June amending Directive 75/268 /EEC onassistance to less favoured areas (in particular increasing the maximumpermissible rate for annual compensatory allowances) and introducingprogrammes for the development of agricultural areas in the west of theIrish Republic and for the development of sheep farming in Greenland.The Council also agreed to restrict aid to investment in the dairy and pigssectors; but draft regulations amending Directive 72/159/EEC to implementthese decisions had not been adopted by the end of June. The Counciltook note that the Commission would be putting forward additional structuralproposals for Northern Ireland.14
Monetary Arrangements4.8 At its meeting on 21-24 April, the Agriculture Council prolongedthe provisions prescribing the use of the European Currency Unit (ECU)for CAP purposes until 30 June. Subsequently they were further prolongeduntil 31 March 1981. At its April meeting the Council also agreed toamend the so-called &quot; franchise &quot; rules, which concern the deductions madefrom the percentage difference between the green rate and market rate ofa currency for the purpose of calculating monetary compensatory amounts(MCAs). As a result the &quot; franchise &quot; rules are now the same for all MemberStates, which will help to avoid trade distortions.4.9 At its meeting on 6-7 May, the Council agreed to devaluation ofthe green currencies of France (1.3 per cent) and Italy (3.5 per cent). Atthe meeting on 28-30 May, as part of the agreement on CAP prices for1980-81, the German and Benelux green currencies were revalued by 1.1per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.Morton and Lamb and Potatoes4.10 The Agriculture Council on 28-30 May reached agreement on themain provisions of a common organisation of the market for mutton andlamb. At the United Kingdom&apos;s insistence the agreement provided forMember States to operate a deficiency payment system of support to sheepproducers as an alternative to intervention. There will thus be no interven-tion in the United Kingdom. Provision was also made for annual premiumpayments to producers to cushion producer incomes from the effect of theintroduction of free trade; the reference prices against which these premiumswill be calculated will be aligned to bring about a common level of supportin four years. The Council agreed that the regime would only come intoforce when voluntary restraint agreements had been concluded with NewZealand and other third country suppliers. These would limit their exportsto the Community to traditional levels in return for a reduction in the20 per cent import duty.4.11 The French Government refused to lift their controls on the importof sheepmeat from the United Kingdom until the coming into force of thenew regime despite the ruling by the European Court of Justice of September1979 that the controls were illegal under the Treaty of Rome. The Com-mission have instituted two further cases against France in the EuropeanCourt.4.12 Discussions continue on the Commission&apos;s proposals for a commonmarket organisation for potatoes.Sugar4.13 No agreement was reached in negotiations on Commissionproposals for a revised sugar regime. In June the Council agreed to extendthe existing regime, largely unchanged, for another year.1512745 d*
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.14 In the first six months of 1980 the United Kingdom received  33million from the Guidance section of the EAGGF in respect of claims madein 1979. This includes  7.6 million for individual projects approved underRegulation 17/64 and projects under Regulation 355/77 on marketing andprocessing.Animal Health and Welfare4.15 The Agriculture Council on 22 January adopted a Directive whichwill bring the methods used throughout the Community for dealing withoutbreaks of swine fever onto a uniform basis. The implementation datewhich is proposed at present is 1 January 1981. Derogations, which allownational controls to be applied to reduce the risk of introducing swine feverthrough the import of pigs and pigmeat from other Member States, wereextended to the end of October 1980. In the meantime measures to eradicatethe disease from the Community including financial support are beingconsidered, together with work on the adaptation of existing Directives toprovide better protection to those countries, including the United Kingdom,which have eradicated the disease.4.16 Two other Directives were adopted. The first introduced standardanimal health controls for intra-Community trade in meat products. Thesecond further amends arrangements for the control of bovine tuberculosisand brucellosis.4.17 The Council received the Commission&apos;s proposals for a regulationon zootechnical standards for breeding pure-bred and hybrid pigs. Thismatter was remitted for discussion at technical level where work alsoprogressed on a draft directive on acceptance for breeding purposes ofpure-bred cattie.4.18 The Commission&apos;s proposals for developing the existing safe-guards of Directive 77/489 EEC, which protects the welfare of animals duringinternational transport, continue to be discussed at technical level withinthe Council. The Commission has been working on its remit from theCouncil to make proposals to bring to an end the system of keeping hens inbattery cages as currently practised by the Community; to propose interimmeasures; and to report on systems of egg production which would be ableto satisfy animal health requirements and those of hygiene and social ethics,and which would take economic considerations into account.FisheriesInternal Regime4.19 At the Fisheries Council on 29 January agreement was reachedon Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for 1980 for fish stocks existing whollyor partly within the waters of Member States, and on the amount availableto Member States as a whole after taking account of the division of shared16
stocks and of allocations to third countries. Agreement was also reached ona catch reporting regulation which the Government welcomed as an impor-tant first step in developing an effective common Community system ofcatch recording and reporting. These agreements were published on 26March as Regulations 754/80 and 753/80 respectively. The interimmeasure adopted in December 1978, requiring Member States to exercise ameasure of restraint over their catches in the light of scientific advice, wassubsequently extended to 30 June.4.20 On 30 May the Foreign Affairs Council agreed a statement com-mitting all Member States to agreement on all the main aspects of theCommon Fisheries Policy to come into effect at the latest on 1 January 1981.All the essential elements identified by the Government were incorporatedin the text in terms compatible with the Government&apos;s objectives and leavingsubstantive negotiations to be undertaken in the Fisheries Council on theseissues in their own right.4.21 On 16 June the Fisheries Council extended the interim Decisionon internal fishing arrangements to 31 July and held a general discussionof the principles that would govern the allocation of catch quotas betweenMember States on the basis of a background document proposed by theCommission.External Regime4.22 On 27 February framework agreements were signed with Norwayand Guinea Bissau; in April agreements were signed with Spain and (for1980 only) Canada.4.23 On 16 June the Council agreed to ratification of the frameworkagreements with the Faroe Islands, Norway, Sweden, Canada (for 1980only), Senegal and Guinea Bissau. The Council also agreed ratification ofan agreement with Sweden under which the Community would contributeto salmon rearing costs in exchange for quotas in the Baltic.SECTION V:  ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARYQUESTIONSEconomic and Monetary Co-operationThe United Kingdom&apos;s Net Contribution5.1 The Finance Council played a subsidiary but important role in thenegotiations for a reduction in the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution tothe Community Budget. In particular it examined the Commission&apos;s revisedestimates of net transfers through the Community Budget in 1980 and 1981,and agreed that the reduction in the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution couldbe made by amendments to the existing Financial Mechanism, and throughCommunity financial support for public infrastructure programmes in theUnited Kingdom.1712745 d*2
5.2 At its 11 February meeting, the Council adopted a resolution onagriculture emphasizing that a substantial reduction in the growth ofagriculture spending was needed to ensure that the 1 per cent VAT ceilingwas not exceeded. This required both a prudent price policy and furthereconomy measures, which should be directed particularly at products insurplus. The Foreign Affairs Council reaffirmed this conclusion as part of itsagreement on the United Kingdom&apos;s budget problem on 30 May.Other Finance Council Business5.3 Apart from regular exchanges of views on the economic situationin the Community, the Finance Council considered a number of reportsfrom the specialist committees of the Community. On 17 March it endorseda Commission communication on the need to improve the coordination ofeconomic policies in the Community. On 21 April, the Council received areport by the Commission on the operation of the New CommunityInstrument (the Ortoli Facility) and the scheme of European MonetarySystem interest rate subsidies during 1979. The Commission has put for-ward a proposal for a second tranche of loans under the New CommunityInstrument, which, like the first tranche, would be for 500 MEUA ( 303millionX1) and cover energy and infrastructure projects. On 9 June, theCouncil endorsed the report from the Economic Policy Committee whichconsidered the lessons to be drawn from the Community fourth mediumterm economic programme in drawing up the fifth programme which isdue to be adopted in 1981.5.4 The June Finance Council discussed the financial problems posedby the need to recycle the large oil producer surpluses that have arisen asa result of the large increase in oil prices between 1979 and 1980. Itagreed on the importance of the role of international financial institutions inthis field, but asked the Monetary Committee to investigate a number ofpossibilities to see whether there was any need for the Community to takespecific action.European Investment Bank (EIB)5.5 The Governors of the EIB held their annual meeting on 9 June,and considered a report on the medium term outlook for the Bank. Theyagreed to raise the ceiling on the loans which the Bank can make outsidethe Community by the 1600 MEUA ( 970 million)Q.Budgetary QuestionsThe 1980 Community Budget5.6 In the absence of an agreed Budget for 1980, Community expen-diture in this period was financed under certain provisions of Article 204 ofthe Treaty of Rome, the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 and ofRegulation 2891/77; for each chapter of the Budget they involve a limitationon monthly Community expenditure by reference to the lower of the provisionsin the 1979 Budget or the 1980 Draft Budget and a limitation of the VATC) Converted at the rate of 1 -65 eua =  1.18
element in monthly contributions by Member States. Levies and duties havecontinued to be paid over in full.5.7 On 29 February the Commission forwarded to the Council newbudget proposals for the 1980 Budget amounting to 14,391 MEUA (approxi-mately  9,715 millionX1) for payment appropriations and 16,121 MEUA(approximately  10,883 millionX1) for commitment appropriations.5.8 Following the decisions of the Council on agricultural prices andon arrangements to reduce the United Kingdom net contribution, and thelatest available information on other areas of expenditure, the Commissionforwarded a letter of Amendment in June providing for an increase in bothpayment and commitment appropriations of 1,552 MEUA (about  1,047millionX1) raising the general budget to 15,944 MEUA (about  10,763millionX1) for payments and 17,994 MEUA (about  12,147 million)0 forcommitments. The Letter of Amendment took account of revenue changesin the estimated yields of sugar and isoglucose levies and agricultural leviesand provided for an increase in VAT own resources.5.9 On 17 June the Budget Council discussed the new budget proposalsand following further discussion with the European Parliament in Strasbourgon 18 June the Council established a 1980 Draft Budget on 20 June. Thisnew Draft Budget was then considered by the European Parliament inLuxembourg when various amendments totalling 11 MEUA for commit-ments (approx  7 millionX1) and 2 MEUA for payments (approx  1-4million)^) and a modification which did not affect the budget total wereapproved on 27 June. The Council examined the Parliament&apos;s proposalsand on 30 June decided to accept the Parliament&apos;s amendments but to rejectthe modification (in respect of refunds for milk and milk products).The Customs Union5.10 In May the Council adopted a Regulation which provided for thereplacement of the previous Community Customs valuation system, basedon the 1950 Brussels Convention on the Valuation of Goods for CustomsPurposes, by the system of valuation drawn up during the latest round ofGATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The new system is aimed atgiving greater uniformity in the methods of arriving at the value on whichad valorem duties are based. The Valuation Agreement of the basic GATTAgreement comes into operation generally on 1 January 1981, but theEuropean Community and the USA have agreed to implement the ValuationAgreement from 1 July 1980. The main advantages of the new systemto United Kingdom exporters are that it will end the American Selling Pricevaluation system and that it will be operated by a greater number ofindustrialised countries than the system it replaces.Export Credit5.11 A proposal by the Community (which participates as a singleentity in the Arrangement on Guidelines for Export Credit) to increase0 Converted at the rate of 1-4813 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1980Budget purposes.19
minimum interest rates as set out in the Guidelines by 0-75 per cent forrich and intermediate countries and by 0-25 per cent for poorer countrieswas agreed by Participants (all members of the OECD except Turkey andIceland) at the annual review of the Guidelines in May. The Guidelinesgovern the extension of officially supported credit on terms of two years ormore in order to contain destructive competition on credit terms betweencredit giving countries.Financial Control in the Community (Court of Auditors)5.12 The European Court of Auditor&apos;s Annual Report, for the financialyear 1978, was published in the Official Journal on 31 December 1979. Sub-sequently, the Council Recommendation on the Discharge to be given tothe Commission in respect of the implementation of the 1978 Budget andSupplementary Budgets was approved by the European Parliament.5.13 The Court of Auditors is the newest of the Community institutions.It was established by the 1975 Treaty amending certain financial provisionsof the Treaty of Rome, and its members (one from each member state) wereappointed in October 1977. The Annual Report is therefore the Court&apos;ssecond, but the first to be based entirely on their work.SECTION VI:  REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans6.1 The Commumty made loans totalling  10-9 million under Article56 of the Treaty of Paris following applications from United Kingdomcompanies in respect of projects creating employment opportunities forex-steel and coal workers. Further loans are under negotiation. The UnitedKingdom Government provided guarantees against possible loss or currencyfluctuations over the period of the loans for projects in the Assisted Areas.European Regional Development Fund6.2 The Council has not yet reached agreement on proposals consideredin December 1979 concerning specific regional development measures makinguse of the provision for 5 per cent of the fund to be used outside nationalquotas.6.3 In their original budget proposals for 1980, the Commission includedprovision for 1,200 MEUA (about  727 millionX1) but in December theEuropean Parliament rejected the whole of the proposed budget. A revisedbudget includes provision for 1,165 MEUA (about  706 millionX1) for 1980.C1) Converted at the July market rate of 1 - 65 eua =  1.20
Review of Regional Aids by the Commission6.4 The United Kingdom continued to supply the Commission withinformation on United Kingdom regional aids as part of the Commission&apos;sreview of Member States&apos; systems of regional aids. The review is expectedto be completed in the latter half of 1980.Aid Transparency6.5 On 25 June, the Commission adopted a Directive, under Article 90of the Treaty of Rome, designed to bring greater transparency in the transferof public funds to public undertakings in Member States. The Directivewill require Member States to provide information at the Commission&apos;srequest about their financial transfers to their public undertakings, so thatthe Commission can evaluate whether the financing arrangements involvedare compatible with the state aid provisions of the Treaty.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.6 Private sector manufacturing industry in the Assisted Areascontinued to receive foreign currency loans from EIB with the Governmentcovering them against exchange risk. Loans totalling  32-5 million weremade during the first half of 1980 to United Kingdom private sector invest-ment projects in the Assisted Areas and further loans are under negotiation.Science and Technology6.7 On 13 March after more than a year of discussion Council agree-ment was given to the new multiannual programme of the Community&apos;sJoint Research Centre (IRC). Expenditure of almost 511 MEUA (about 310 millionX1) will be devoted to a four year programme, 1980-1983covering research into the following areas nuclear safety, the study andprotection of the environment, new forms of energy, and preparation andimplementation of reference measurements. Agreement was also reachedon 13 March on a Community research programme on thermonuclear fusionwhich provides funds for fusion research in Member States and also includesthe Joint European Torus (JET) Project currently under construction atCulham in Oxfordshire. Expenditure amounting to 335-5 MEUA (about 203 million).*1) of which 190-5 MEUA (about  115 millionX1) is for JET,will cover a 5 year period.6.8 On 18 March the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to two moreresearch projects. The first is a continuation of the research programmeon radiation protection. The programme, covering a 5 year period andcosting 59 MEUA (about  36 millionX1) aims to increase and improveknowledge of the effects of ionising radiation. The Council also adopteda second concerted action research programme on medical and public health.The programme has an overall cost of 2-32 MEUA (about  1-4 millionX1)and comprises 4 separate projects. They are detection of the tendencyto thrombosis (4 years duration), understanding evaluation and treatment ofO Converted at the July market rate of 1-65 eua =  1.21
hearing impairment (3 years), criteria for perinatal monitoring (4 years),common standards for quantitative electrocardiography (4 years).Steel6.9 Although the United Kingdom steel industry has been seriouslyaffected by the reduced demand for steel, both in the United Kingdom andelsewhere this year, it has been helped by the continuation in a modifiedform during 1980 of the Commission&apos;s anti-crisis measures. United KingdomMinisters have kept the Commission informed of the industry&apos;s structuringplans, and explored with them the scope for increased Community aid tohelp redundant steelworkers.Shipbuilding6.10 The (Tommission has consulted Member States about a successorto the 4th Directive on aids to shipbuilding which provides the frameworkfor the provision and control of aids to the industry and which expires atthe end of this year. Proposals for a 5th Directive are expected to besubmitted to the Council in the near future.New Information Technology (Telematics)6.11 At the Dublin Summit in November 1979 the Council of Ministerswere invited to study with the Commission a common strategy in this area.A number of discussions have taken place between the Commission, MemberStates, Telecommunications Administrations and industry. The UnitedKingdom Government continue to support this initiative.Company Law6.12 A Directive on prospectuses for listed securities was adopted inMarch. Discussions continued throughout the period on a number of draftinstruments including: directives on qualification of auditors, collectiveinvestment funds (unit trusts), annual accounts of credit institutions, lawsrelating to guarantees and indemnities, interim reports by companies listedon a stock exchange, conditions of access to the profession of stockbroker,insider dealing and prospectuses for unlisted securities; conventions qnbankruptcy and the mutual recognition of companies; and on the EuropeanCompany Statute.6.13 In addition negotiations are at an advanced stage on draft directiveson group accounts and on &quot; scissions &quot; (the division of companies).Insurance6.14 The co-insurance Directive, the first major step towards increasingfreedom of services in insurance in the EC, came into force on 2 June.Progress has been slow on work on the more general draft directive concernedwith this freedom.22
Industrial Property6.15 Work continued on the steps necessary to implement theCommunity Patent Convention. Work has also been maintained on theconsideration of the creation of a Community Trade Mark. The Governmentreaffirmed in Brussels its wish to see the Community Trade Mark Officeestablished in London.Films6.16 Following the Commission&apos;s initiative in August 1979 discussionson aspects of our Film Acts were successfully concluded. As a result theFilms Act 1980 provides for an extension of the labour-cost requirementfor a film&apos;s registration as British to include payments to citizens of otherMember States. This provision will come into effect when forthcomingamendments to the Levy Regulations have been approved by Parliament.These amendments will be designed to help preserve the infrastructure ofthe British film industry.Commercial Agency6.17 The Council Working Group continued its consideration of theproposed commercial agency directive. The main purposes of the proposalare to harmonise the laws of the Member States relating to commercialagents, differences in which the Commission considers to be detrimental tothe functioning of the Community, and to strengthen the position of thecommercial agent who is assumed to be the weaker party in negotiating withhis principal. In view of conflicting reactions to the proposed commercialagency directive in the United Kingdom the Government has reserved itsposition and is working to achieve a directive that would prove moreacceptable.SECTION VII:  ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues7.1 The Environment Council met on 30 June. Following an initiativeby the United Kingdom last December, the Council agreed in principle thestructure of a draft regulation banning the import into the Community ofwhale products. The Council also considered a draft directive aimed atreducing the danger to the public of major industrial accidents, the so-called&apos; Seveso&apos; proposal; many of the outstanding issues were resolved, but fullagreement was not reached and the proposal was referred back for furtherconsideration.7.2 There was also a general discussion at the Environment Council onfuture Community action on the environment. This marked the beginningof consideration by the Council of what should follow the present environ-ment action programme, which expires at the end of 1981.23
Inland Transport7.3 At the Transport Council on 24 June, considerable progress wasmade towards agreeing a directive on the recognition and exchange ofdriving licences within the Community. Other Member States&apos; licences forpublic service vehicles and heavy goods vehicles would be exchanged by theUnited Kingdom on the basis of certificates of adequate experience signedby a previous employer and validated in cases of serious doubt by thecompetent authorities of the Member State whose licence was beingexchanged. The directive would also require licences in all Member Statesto be issued in a common format by 1 January 1986 and would include adeclaration on further harmonisation of standards with a view to improvingroad safety throughout the Community. The Government are consultinginterested bodies on the proposals, and will seek the views of Parliamentbefore giving a decision in the Council of Ministers. A Directive on inlandwaterway statistics was also agreed, and other proposals considered on railstatistics, rail tariffs and combined transport.7.4 The Council took note of the Commission&apos;s report on the implemen-tation of the drivers&apos; hours Regulation in 1975 and 1976, and asked theCommission to pursue with Member States the need for uniform applicationof the legislation. Among progress reports to the Council was one on the draftregulation on EC aid to transport infrastructure projects of Communityinterest. The Commission held a colloquium on the subject on 6 June; andon 25 June they submitted to the Council a Report on Bottlenecks andPossible Modes of Finance. The Government have consulted interestedbodies in the United Kingdom on the Commission&apos;s Green Paper on trans-port infrastructure, which was published in November 1979.Summer Time7.5 The June Transport Council approved in principle a proposal forcommon starting dates for summer time in 1981 and 1982, which involvethe United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland postponing and otherMember States advancing their previously proposed changeover dates byone week. There will be further discussion on starting dates after 1982 andon finishing dates although the United Kingdom has already made it clearthat there is likely to be considerable difficulty with the latter, where fourweeks and sometimes five weeks currently separate the United Kingdom andthe Republic of Ireland from other Member States.Shipping7.6 The Commission continued discussions with European shippers andshipowners on the content of a draft regulation applying the competitionrules in the Treaty of Rome to Shipping.7.7 The Community institutions continued their examination of variousproposals intended to promote marine safety and pollution prevention.The Commission presented a proposal for a directive concerning the enforce-ment, in respect of shipping using Community ports, of the relevantinternational standards.24
Civil Aviation7.8 The Commission has consulted Member States on the terms of adraft directive for the liberalisation of intra-Community regional air servicesprior to presenting a final draft to the Council.7.9 On 24 June the Transport Council approved a recommendation thatthe Commission, in consultation with Member States, should examinescheduled air fares in the Community and should report on the results ofits examination as soon as possible.7.10 The Commission has consulted Member States on the terms ofa draft regulation for the application of the Competition Articles of theTreaty of Rome to civil aviation. It is expected that a final draft will bepresented to the Council by the end of the year.SECTION VIII:  SOCIAL AFFAIRSEmployment8.1 The Standing Committee on Employment (representatives fromemployers and workers as well as Employment Ministers and the Com-mission) met on 26 February and exchanged views on a Commissioncommunication on the problems posed for employment by the new phase inthe technological development of micro-electronics. It was recognised thatthe introduction of the new technology raised major issues but if carefullyintroduced and having regard to the need for close consultation and prioragreement of the workforce also offered significant opportunities.8.2 The Committee met again on 29 May to discuss the Commissioncommunication on guidelines for a Community labour market policy. TheCommittee felt that more efficient operation of the labour market wouldbe achieved by improved use of the Social Fund and closer integration ofthe Community labour market. It was also suggested that more attentioncould be given in future to employment aspects of economic policies.8.3 Employment Ministers met informally in Venice on 15 and 16 May.They discussed the problems of employment and the broad outlines of aCommunity labour market policy. They also discussed the Commission&apos;sintention to present a draft directive concerning the right to information andconsultation of workers at European level by multinational companies andthe problems of third country migrants, in particular Turkish migrants.Ministers also talked in general terms about the participation of salariedworkers in asset formation and some problems of social security.8.4 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on 9 June. Againsta background of rising unemployment the Council discussed the working ofthe labour market and agreed a Resolution on Guidelines for a Community25
Labour Market Policy. This Resolution recognises that efficient operationof the labour market has an important, if supporting, role in efforts toincrease employment and sets out some broad objectives and suggestedactions in the areas of labour market information and manpower services.The Council reached agreement on a Directive to protect workers fromharmful exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents at work andon a revised procedure for improving the working methods for tripartiteconferences. The Council also agreed conclusions on the Community&apos;saction programme for the vocational rehabilitation of the handicappedand briefly discussed the relationship between health and safety at the workplace and directives under the Commission&apos;s programme for removingbarriers to trade in industrial products.European Social Fund8.5 In May the Commission published revised guidelines for themanagement of the Fund which set out the priorities which will be appliedto applications for 1981-83. Allocations made so far this year for trainingand other schemes in the United Kingdom amount to some  64 million.Social Security8.6 The Labour and Social Affairs Council in June considered theCommission&apos;s proposals for the adaptation of the Council Regulation onthe application of social security schemes to employed persons and theirfamilies moving within the Community to extend it to self-employed personsand their families and insured non-employed persons. The proposals whichare largely the result of United Kingdom initiative were, as in previousCouncils, acceptable to the majority. Reservations on the use of Article 235of the Treaty to extend the Regulations to the non-employed and on thearrangements for payment of family benefits proved, however, to be intract-able and agreement could not be reached. Discussion is to continue in aworking group of the Council with a view to resolving the outstanding issuesbefore the next Council meeting in November.Anti-Poverty Programme8.7 The present programme of pilot schemes and studies to combatpoverty was set up in 1975 and is due to come to an end in November.The Commission has proposed an interim programme to cover the period(about two years) between November and the setting up of any further pro-gramme which might be based on an evaluation of the present one: theCommission is to produce a report on the present programme by June 1981.The Labour and Social Affairs Council discussed the proposal for an interimprogramme on 9 June, but a decision was deferred until November.Education8.8 On 27 June, the Community&apos;s Education Ministers accepted a reportby the Education Committee on the implementation of the Resolution of9 February 1976.  It included proposals for action in modern languages,26
the study of the European Community and Europe in schools, and thepromotion of equal opportunities in education for girls. It also defined acommon approach to the admission to institutions of higher education ofstudents from other Community countries; United Kingdom Ministers hadalready announced in April that students from other Member States wouldbe charged the same tuition fees as United Kingdom students from 1980/81onwards. All these proposals have formed the subject of consultation inthe United Kingdom over the past 3 years with interested bodies, andwere generally supported by them. In the course of their discussion in theEducation Committee, the proposals have been amended in ways that madethem more appropriate and relevant to the United Kingdom educationsystems. It is expected that they will start to be implemented in 1981 andthat action will continue until 1985.8.9 A paper was also submitted to the Ministers about education inthe context of employment policy, with particular reference to the transitionfrom school to work, and to the implications for education of the newinformation technologies. Ministers also indicated their interest in a Frenchinitiative for the preparation of a guide for teachers on European civilisation.Rights of Establishment8.10 Discussion continued on proposals for the mutual recognition ofprofessional qualifications in a number of fields, notably architects andaccountants. Preliminary discussions were also held on engineers andother technical advisers and on hairdressers.Free Movement within the Community8.11 The Government hope that barriers to free movement within theCommunity can be reduced, although not at the expense of efficient controlson immigration and the movement of terrorists. As one small step, theGovernment lifted (with effect from 1 January) the requirement for nationalsfrom other Member States to fill in landing and embarkation cards onentering and leaving the United Kingdom.Common Format Passport8.12 Further discussions were held on proposals for a common formatfor passports issued by Member States. The United Kingdom has arguedthat account should be taken of the recent International Civil AviationOrganisation recommendation on machine-readable passports.SECTION IX: ENERGY9.1 The 13 May Energy Council devoted particular attention to thecurrent and prospective situation of the world oil market, and to theCommunity&apos;s energy strategy for the decade to 1990, in preparation forwider discussion of these matters at the subsequent meeting of IEA Energy27
Ministers on 22 May. As part of the strategy for 1990 the Council adoptedtwo Resolutions. The first established general Community energy policyguidelines for 1990 emphasising in particular the need to use energy moreefficiently; to reduce oil&apos;s share of total primary energy consumption; andto develop alternative energy sources in particular coal and nuclear forelectricity generation. The second Resolution set out more detailed guide-lines for action in the field of energy saving. The Council agreed to considerwhat additional measures might be necessary to improve the Community&apos;scapacity to cope with oil market disturbances or supply shortage. TheCouncil agreed to review at a future Council the case for additional supportat Community level to Member States&apos; energy investment programmes.SECTION X:  CONSUMER AFFAIRS10.1 Discussion has continued on the Second Consumer ActionProgramme, and also on several draft directives foreshadowed in the firstprogramme; discussion of the draft product liability directive has commenced.Size Ranges for Pre-Packaged Goods10.2 On 15 January the Foreign Affairs Council adopted a Directiveunder Article 100 aimed at reducing barriers to trade by specifying rangesof sizes for certain pre-packaged foodstuffs and common household productswhich must be accepted on Community markets. The Directive also containsan important consumer protection element in that the specified rangesgenerally consist of simply-related sizes so as to enable easy value-for-money comparisons to be made. Although these sizes are not mandatory,industry is encouraged to adopt them by virtue of the freedom of entryinto Community markets that the Directive ensures for the specified sizes.SECTION XI:  THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYCommittee of Three (Three Wise Men)11.1 The Report of the Committee of Three on the Institutions of theCommunity which was commissioned by the European Council in December1978, was submitted to the European Council on 12-13 June in Venice. Nofinal decisions were taken; the Council of Ministers is pursuing considerationof the Report.The European Parliament11.2 The European Parliament held 6 plenary sittings each lasting aweek in Strasbourg and an additional two days part session was held inLuxembourg at the end of June.European Court of Justice11.3 One of the chief concerns of the Court during recent years hasbeen the steady increase in the number of cases brought before it. While28
the first half of 1980 has continued to see an increase in the number ofcases, the amendments to the Rules of Procedure made in September 1979,which among other things allow a greater number of cases to go to Chambers(Divisions) of the Court, are beginning to show their effects. The averageduration of references for a preliminary ruling remains, as in 1979, just over9 months, while the average duration of direct actions has been reducedfrom 16 to 13 months. The increasing number of cases has, however, putgreater pressure on the Advocates-General, and a proposal to increase theirnumber from 4 to 5 is at present before a Council Working Party.11.4 In the period under review United Kingdom courts referred 3 casesto the Court for preliminary ruling; the Government submitted observationsin all of those cases and in 7 other cases referred by courts of other MemberStates. In addition the Government intervened in two direct actions broughtby the Commission.11.5 The Court has given judgment in a series of cases brought by theCommission against the United Kingdom and 4 other Member States allegingbreaches of Article 95 of the Treaty by the unequal imposition of dutieson beer, wine and spirits. In the cases against France, Italy, Denmark andIreland the Court found in favour of the Commission; in the case againstthe United Kingdom, however, the Court made no ruling but ordered theparties to re-examine the matter in the light of certain legal considerationsand to report to the Court on the results of their re-examination before theend of the year. In a reference from a United Kingdom court, the Courtdeclared that Article 119 of the Treaty (equal pay) was directly applicable,and that a woman employee was entitled to the same pay as her malepredecessor although the two had not been employed contemporaneously.Legal Co-operation11.6 Since before our accession to the Community, experts from theMember States have been working on the harmonisation of the &quot; choice oflaw &quot; rules of the Member States. In 1978 it was decided to limit this workto contractual obligations, and in 1979 a draft Convention was circulatedto Member States for their comments. Views on the draft were soughtfrom interested persons and bodies in the second half of 1979, and indiscussions resumed earlier this year the text was finalised taking accountof these views. By common consent of all Member States the Conventionwas opened for signature at a meeting of Ministers of Justice in Rome on19 June. The Convention has not yet been signed by the United Kingdom;it will require ratification, and implementation in the United Kingdom wouldrequire legislation.Terrorism11.7 As part of the Community&apos;s programme of co-operation againstterrorism senior officials met in Rome in May to consider reports fromWorking Groups. A seminar for officials from the Community on the subject&quot; Terrorism and the Media &quot; was held in London on 30 April and 1 May.29
SECTION XII: PARLIAMENTParliament was in session for 22 weeks during the period from1 January to 30 June. During that time the House of Commons ScrutinyCommittee considered 341 Community documents and recommended 38 ofthese for further consideration by the House. The House of Lords ScrutinyCommittee considered 415 documents in this period, of which 16 wererecommended for debate. Debates on 40 documents were held in theHouse of Commons and on 13 in the House of Lords.30

ANNEX inCONCLUSIONS OF THE 29/30 MAYFOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL1. The net United Kingdom contribution for 1980 will be calculated onthe basis of the present Commission estimates (1,784 MEUA). 1,175 MEUAwill be deducted from this figure. This leaves a United Kingdom contri-bution of 609 MEUA for 1980.2. The net United Kingdom contribution for 1981 will be calculated onthe basis of the Commission estimate of 2,140 MEUA. The UnitedKingdom&apos;s 1980 net contribution will be increased by a percentage equal tothe difference between 1,784 and 2,140 MEUA namely 19   9 per cent or121 MEUA. The net United Kingdom contribution for 1981 thereforebecomes 730 MEUA.3. The United Kingdom contribution, based on the above calculations,is reduced for 1980 and 1981 by 2,585 MEUA (1,175 plus 1,410).4. If the United Kingdom&apos;s actual contributions for 1980 and 1981 arehigher than 1,784 and 2,140 MEUA respectively, the difference will besplit for the first year 25 per cent will be borne by the United Kingdomand 75 per cent by the other 8 Member States. For the secondyear increase from 730-750 to be borne in full by the United Kingdom:from 750 to 850, 50 per cent to be borne by the United Kingdom and 50 percent by the other 8 Member States: above 850, 25 per cent to be borne byUnited Kingdom and 75 per cent by others.5. Payments over the period 1980-82 should be made by means of theadapted financial mechanism and the supplementary measures proposed bythe Commission. The financial mechanism will continue to function auto-matically until the end of 1982.6. The credits are inscribed in the budget of the following year,following the precedent of the financial mechanism. At the request of theUnited Kingdom the Council can decide each year on a proposal by theCommission to make advances to permit the accelerated implementation ofthe supplementary measures.7. For 1982, the Community is pledged to resolve the problem bymeans of structural changes (Commission mandate to be fulfilled by theend of June 1981. The examination should concern the development ofCommunity policies without calling into question the common financialresponsibility of these policies, which are financed from the Community&apos;sown resources, nor the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.Taking account of the situations and interests of all Member States, thisexamination will aim to prevent the recurrence of unacceptable situationsfor any of them). If this is not achieved, the Commission will make pro-posals along the lines of the 1980-81 solution and the Council will actaccordingly.38
8. The Council reaffirms the conclusions adopted by it (in its compo-sition of Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance) on 11 February 1980(cf. Annex to Doc. 5081/80 PV/CONS 5 ECO/FIN 9), which includedreference to the 1 per cent VAT own resources ceiling.9. It is important for the future well-being of the Community that dayto day decisions and policy making should function effectively and thisparticularly during the period when the review foreseen in paragraph 7 isunder way. With this objective in mind all Member States undertake to dotheir best to ensure that Community decisions are taken expeditiously andin particular that decisions on agricultural price fixing are taken in time forthe next marketing season.39

ANNEX VIUNITED KINGDOM VISIBLE TRADE WITH THEEUROPEAN COMMUNITYImportance of Trade with the European Community1. Throughout the 1970s our trade with the European Communitycontinued to expand more rapidly than our trade with the rest of the world,and the Community now accounts for over 40 per cent of our overseastrade, compared with less than 30 per cent in 1970. In 1979 the FederalRepublic of Germany overtook the United States as our leading exportmarket, while all the Community countries featured among our top tenexport markets.Trade Performance with die European Community (see Table 1)2. Our visible trade with the European Community has been in deficitby  2- 2J billion in each year since 1974. However the ratio of the volumeof our exports to the Community to our imports from the Community, whichmakes allowance for the impact of inflation, was 86 per cent in 1979, aconsiderable improvement on the figures for our earlier years of membership,and the highest since 1971.By Commodity (see Table 2)3. The overall performance conceals some decline in our trading per-formance in manufactures, which has also been evident in our trade withthe rest of the developed world. Manufactures account for nearly three-quarters of our trade with the Community, and a major feature in recentyears has been a rapid increase in imports of road vehicles, which is largelythe result of increased trading by multi-national companies. Nevertheless,the United Kingdom share of the European Community import market formanufactures has recently been increasing, and is likely to have reached7-7^ per cent in 1979, compared with 6 per cent in the early years ofmembership. Elsewhere, there have been improvements in our trade withthe Community in fuels particularly, and also in food.4. Any apparent discrepancy in the statistics on balances given in Tables1 and 2 is due to rounding.42
