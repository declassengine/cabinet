CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 60COPY NO    ~ .22 October 1980CABINET1981-82 CASH LIMITS AND VOTES:PAY AND PRICE FACTORSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. We need to decide now the inflation factors to be used in fixing cashlimits for 1981-82.    This is material to the decision to be taken during thenext month on the Rate Support Grant (RSG).    It will be useful to announcethe factors generally in the near future.2. These factors need to be considered at the same time as the volumeprogrammes discussed in C(80) 58.    It is the cash limits which willultimately determine how much money is available for the cash controlledprogrammes next year.     Whatever figures we decide, it is central to ourpolicy mat the resulting cash limits should be rigorously observed.3. The cash limits cover over  40 billion at late 1979 prices, that is,much of central Government expenditure including defence, the hospital andcommunity health service and universities, and the RSG and local authoritycapital expenditure.A. PAY4. On pay, cash limits cover numerous public service pay groupsincluding the Armed Forces, doctors, nurses, National Health Serviceancillaries, teachers, local authority manual workers and civil servants.5. The suggestion has been made that the 1981-82 cash limits and Votesshould provide for a 6 per cent annual increase in earnings from due settle-ment dates in the current pay round, for all public service groups includingthe Armed Forces.6. Certain ancillary questions concerning the provision to be made forsettlements due late in 1980 or late in 1981 and so belonging to the next payround, and the treatment of staging, are under discussion separately. Whenthese matters are settled, the decisions will need to be reflected in the actualcalculation of cash limits.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALB. PRICES7. I propose that in cash limits and Votes we provide for an increase inprices of 11 per cent between 1980-81 and 1981-82 (average over the year asa whole).    This is clearly within the range of realistic expectation, butrequires the recent good performance on prices to be continued. Somemoderate degree of cash limit squeeze may still be implied.    Quite distinctfrom this is the general volume cut proposed in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper.8. Eleven per cent would apply to all expenditure other than pay. Thereis no significant difference in the price prospects in the different areas ofexpenditure, so it is not necessary to use a range of different price factorsas in the past.9. This combined with the factors for pay (paragraph 5 above), withappropriate weighting, would be the provision for pay and price increasesin the RSGCONCLUSION10. I invite colleagues to consider the proposals in paragraphs 5 and 7above.G HTreasury Chambers22 October 19802CONFIDENTIAL
