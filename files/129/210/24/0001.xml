confidentialIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTIC(80) 74COPY NO  r n5 December 1980CABINETCIVIL, SERVICE MANPOWER: ESTIMATES 1981-82Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. In my paper for Cabinet in October on Civil Service numbers (C(80)56)I said that present plane would-produce a Service of 695, 000 on 1 April 1981and 685, 000 on 1 April 1982.    But the effects on staff numbers of risingunemployment could make the position much worse.    So savings wouldhave to be brought forward to the maximum extent and reflected in theEstimates for 1981-82.MANPOWER BIDS FOR 1981-822. Departments&apos; bids for Civil Service manpower for 1981-82 have nowbeen received and assessed in the Civil Service Department. Colleagueshave clearly made efforts to contain their bids, and I am grateful. Butthe fast growth in the provision to deal with unemployment (Department ofEmployment and Department of Health and Social Security) is throwing usoff course; and some Departments (in particular the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s, Defence and Transport) have not yet succeeded in bringingforward into 1981-82 sufficient savings to offset these rises and to keep theoverall figures moving downwards at a defensible pace. &gt;  THE PROBLEM3. The position has, therefore, deteriorated as I feared in October.The figures are as follows:-Staff in post 1 October 1980 697,000Estimate bids      1 April 1981 698, 500Estimate bids      1 April 1982 693,000The actual numbers of staff in post may in the event be a little lower thanthese Estimates.    But we cannot publish Estimates of this size for1 April 1981; they must come down.    Further, the proposed rate ofreduction to 1 April 1982 is much too modest.  And we cannot bank on eventhis in view of the uncertainties of the unemployment forecasts. Certainlywe cannot be sure that every quarter&apos;s figures, as they are announced, willshow a steady fall,1confidential
confidential4. In my statement in the House of Loris in December 1979 Irecognised that &quot;there may be short-term fluctuations&quot; in the generaldownward trend*    But a rise, however short-lived, would be politicallyvery damaging, particularly in the changed climate of rapidly-rising privatesector unemployment and increasing Parliamentary concern about ourchances of achieving the 630, 000 target*   It will be expected that eachquarter&apos;s figures should be lower than the previous quarter&apos;s, and we shallbe in trouble if they are not.RECRUITMENT RESTRICTIONS5. So I fear I can see no alternative to severe restrictions on recruitmenThese would be on the lines of those we imposed temporarily on coming intooffice.    They would have to last until we had established a clear and strongdownward trend in Civil Service numbers in the new circumstances ofrapidly rising unemployment.    I do not recommend this lightly - I am wellaware of the real difficulties such restrictions cause for management. Andit will be a further blow for the Civil Service Unions.    But we must keep aclear downward trend and run no risk of numbers going up.    We shall haveto look at all possible sources of savings in the course of 1981-82 - I shallbe in touch with colleagues.CONCLUSIONS6. I invite colleagues to agree that:-a. we must establish a clear and strong downward trend inCivil Service numbers towards the 630,000 target;b. we should impose restrictions on recruitment from1 January 1931 on the lines of those we imposed on taking office;c. these restrictions should remain in force until a clearstrong and downward trend has been established;d. I should circulate guidelines on exceptions to colleagues*SCivil Service Department5 December 19802confidential
