DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC&apos; MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 73COPY NO 5 825 November 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1982-83 AND 1983-84Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. As requested at Cabinet last week, I have now discussed with theMinisters concerned those of the proposals in C(80) 72 Table 3 for 1982-83and 1983-84 as were not already agreed.2. / Ths Table attached eut the peliiy xiduolkms now agreed frorrrthe figures in the March White Paper revalued, excluding nationalisedindustries.3. There are no outstanding issues. I need to draw attention to two pointsonly.i. I have agreed with the Minister of Transport that thereductions in his programme for the later years should be limitedto the amounts equivalent te carrying forward the 1 per cent offlocal authority current spending and 2 per cent off other cash-controlled programmes agreed for 1981-82.ii. The Secretary of State for Scotland was asked to considerwhether he could find savings of  20 million in 1982-83 and 30 million in 1983-84, instead of the  10 million additionalreduction already agreed for 1981-82, without these reductionsbecoming publicly evident, when the White Paper is published,as going beyond what would be justified under the standard formula.He has concluded that he sees no way of making these additionalreductions in the published figures without this becoming evident.But he has told me that, if it were possible to go beyond the 10 million without compromising the political considerationswhich Cabinet found persuasive, he would be willing to do so.Accordingly in the next year&apos;s Survey he will review his programmefigures for 1982-83 and 1983-84, to see whether some way could befound of doing this.   I propose therefore that in the coming WhitePaper  nly this year&apos;s  10 million cut should be carried forward intothe next two years and that we return to this question next year.1secret
