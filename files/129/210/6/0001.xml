CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 56 COPY NO 5517 October 1980CABINETCIVIL SERVICE MANPOWER: THE 630, 000 TARGETMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. Our public commitment is a Civil Service of 630, 000 by 1 April 1984.When we last discussed it, colleagues had offered 40, 000 in new savings.After extensive consultations they have offered 8, 000 more, which gets usdown to 637, 000.WHAT NOW?2. We agreed to aim at 620, 000 so as to provide a margin of 10, 000for contingencies.    But many of us were worried that the margin might betoo small.    Events since then have proved this right.    For we can alreadysee claims of around 10, 000, without allowing for any rise in unemploymentabove the present level.    It would be foolish to assume there is not moreto come.   I conclude that we should aim at 615, 000, which would give us amargin of 15, 000.    So I have seen it necessary to find another 22, 000 belowthe 637, 000 which colleagues have offered.3. Overall, after allowing for the growth we have already approved,we need a reduction of 16 per cent of the staff in post on 1 April 1979. Butthis cannot fall evenly, and I am therefore asking some departments formore, some for less.    My proposals for each department are in Annex A,with a brief explanation; I am writing separately to colleagues in greaterdetail.SCOPE FOR EFFICIENCY SAVINGS4. Most offers have included savings from greater efficiency. ButI believe they are over-cautious.    For the three years starting from1 April 1981 they amount to little more than 1 per cent per annum, and I amsure we can do better than this.    Looking at forward plans for staffinspection, Rayner scrutinies and other studies, including Service-widereviews (see Annex B), I believe we can achieve not less than 2 per centper annum overall, and my proposals reflect that.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLEGISLATION5. Some savings will need legislation.    Annex C gives details. Firmplaces will have to be found for these bills in the relevant legislativepro gr amm e s.THE POSITION AT 1 APRIL 19826. A high proportion of the savings will accrue towards the end of theperiod.    Present plans indicate a Service of 695, 000 on 1 April 1981 and685, 000 on 1 April 1982 (details are at Annex D).    This will look bad; theeffects on staff numbers of rising unemployment could make it much worse.So colleagues will see the need to bring their savings forward to themaximum extent, which should be reflected in the Estimates next month.NEW DEMANDS AND THE CONTINGENCY MARGIN7. Now is not the time to make plans for the use of the contingencymargin; we must create it first by agreeing the targets.    But it is alreadyclear that there must be tight restraint.   Apparently we shall need up to2, 000 new staff for every 100, 000 unemployed above two million.    Even ifthese requirements are pared to the bone, the room for new initiativesmay be very small indeed.   I am especially concerned about the effect ofthe taxation of unemployment and incapacity benefits (where the departmentsconcerned have already asked for up to 5, 000 staff).    We cannot settle thequestion today.    But unless part of this demand can be absorbed, it will ofitself claim up to one third of the new margin.SAVINGS AND THE COST OF THE RUNDOWN8. The gross amount saved between 1979 and 1984 will be about 1, 000 million and some  675 million a year thereafter.    But there willbe offsetting costs.    We shall need to retire some people early, and someredundancies will be unavoidable.   A round estimate of the cost is some 150 million over the period.    Some efficiency changes may call forcapital expenditure on, for example, accommodation and computers. Thenprivatisation, including the transfer of pension rights, will also cost money,though it is not yet possible to put a figure to it.PRIVATISATIO N9. Whether a proposed transfer of work out of the Civil Service is tothe private or to the public sector, it must be commensurate as the PrimeMinister has told Parliament, with sound management and good value formoney for the taxpayer.    So each Minister responsible will wish to assurehimself that he can justify his plans on that basis.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION10.       I invite colleagues:a. to adopt the global target of 615, 000;b. to adopt the departments targets proposed in Annex Afor 1 April 1984;c. to note the need for legislation as set out in Annex C.SCivil Service Department17 October 19803CONFIDENTIAL

Footnotes:a   The numbers shown for the Ministry of Defence and the -Foreign and Commonwealth Officeare the published totals for those departments for the date in question.     They includea certain number of civil servants who are not members of those departments but arealways included in their published manpower figures.     The numbers of these civilservants are subject to separate review.     They have therefore been excluded from thereckoning for the purpose of calculating the percentage reductions proposed for thetwo departments.This figure includes the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection.On the non-prison side, the proposed percentage reduction from 1 4 79 to 1 4- 84 is4.2%;    exclusive of growth the reduction is 18.2%.Based on savings of 10% of 1 4- 80 staff-in-post in the Office itself, and 4% in thedepartmental museums (see Appendix).Percentage reduction from 1 4 79 to 1 4 84, exclusive of growth and the specialhospitals, is 19*2%.The overall reduction from 1 4 79 to 1 4 84, excluding prisons and the State Hospital,is 17.5% net of a transfer in of 107 staff from PSA.
CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX TO ANNEX ANotes on individual departmental targets1. Ministry of Defence (including Royal Ordnance Factories)New savings of 17,000 (7.2$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post, excludingthose referred to in the note at the end of Annex A) have beenoffered, to be achieved partly through increased efficiency butwith a substantial proportion dependent on privatisation (the maincandidates are shown in the Appendix to Annex C).   Savings of afurther 10,000 should be possible through further improvementsin efficiency of 1^ per cent per annum.2. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodNew savings of 300 staff have been offered from a reorganisationof the regional structure partly offset by staffing requirementsof new EEC schemes, together with the transfer of the 500 staffof the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to the British Museum (NaturalHistory), a Trustee body.   Most of the remainder of the savingswill   need to come from efficiency improvements across the wholedepartment, including ADAS.3. Department of IndustryNew savings of 530 posts have been offered from improved efficiency.An additional saving of 99   by intensifying the search for greaterefficiency is proposed.4. Department of Trade, Office of Fair Trading, and Export CreditsGuarantee DepartmentOf the new savings of 640 offered in the Department of Trade, 270 willresult from removing personal bankruptcies from the InsolvencyService (with a further reduction of 300 in 1984 - 85), 65 fromabolishing the Registry of Business Names, and 45 from endingimport surveillance licensing and other activities.   A further260 will need to be achieved from general efficiency improvements.ECGD will contribute new savings of only 26 since more coulddamage support for British exports.   In the OFT further cutswould be difficult.   But further saving   of 59 posts from generalefficiency savings in this group of departments is consideredpossible.5. Department of EnergyNew savings of 23 posts have been offered from improved efficiency.A further saving of 47 might be made from economies in the arrangementsfor   Offshore   Supplies ,   and reductions in the PetroleumEngineering Division and in the nationalised industry divisions. Theproposed overall percentage saving   between 1 4 80 and 1 4 84(exclusive of approved growth of 35 posts) is 16.7$.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. Department of Employment GroupNew savings5 * have been offered in Unemployment Benefit Offices (UBOs),the Manpower Services Commission, the Advisory, Conciliationand Arbitration Service, and, to a smaller extent, in the Healthand Safety Executive.   The further savings proposed would needto come from the Rayner study into the payment of benefit tothe unemployed, and from economies in such areas as Job Centres.The proposed overall percentage savings between 1 4 79 and 1 4 84(exclusive of approved growth of 6240 in UBOs to cope Withcurrently assumed increases in unemployment) is 20.3$.7. Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Overseas DevelopmentAdministrationNew savings of 440 will be achieved by a 10$ cut in ODA staff-in-postat 1 4 80 through reductions in the Aid Programme and improvementsin efficiency;   by savings in the Passport Office (assumingreductions in demand by 1984);   and in the Diplomatic Service.Savings of a further 256 posts are proposed.   These could beachieved from one or more of a number of studies currently in hand,eg entry certificate work, security staffing, the India OfficeLibrary and Records;   further aid reductions,   and a review ofODA&apos;s specialist units.   These savings will be partly offset bysome increase in staff numbers through changes in nationality laws,and the introduction of EEC passports.    Savings of 300 locallyengaged staff, who do not count as UK civil servants, are alsoplanned.   Exclusive of growth (and of the staff referred to in thenote at the end of Annex A) the target proposed is 16.4$ below the1 4 79 level.8. Department of TransportExisting plans already aim to reduce the 1 4 79 staff-in-postfigure by 19$, but a further 4$, from improved efficiency andproductivity, is judged feasible.   In addition, with the disbandingof the Road Construction Units, the work of some 1,600 staff(counted as local government employees) will be transferred toprivate consultants, leading to a significant reduction in thetotal number of people employed in the public sector.9. Department of the Environment/Property Services Agency/OrdnancePurveyNew savings in DOE of 10$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post have beenoffered from improvements in efficiency, reductions in functionsand changes in status.   The target assumes that it will be possibleto increase these savings to 12$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post. Newsavings in PSA of 10$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post have also beenoffered from further privatisation of building maintenance work,and (subject to satisfactory cost comparisons) building design work.The target assumes that it will be possible to increase these to12$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post.   The status of the Ordnance Surveyis under review.   The target assumes that new savings of 171 (5$of 1 4 80 staff in-post) can be made from improvements in efficiencyand selective implementation of recommendations in the SerpellReport.   Transfer out of the Civil Service would, on the otherhand, save almost 3,000 posts.CONFIDENTIAL2
CONFIDENTIA10,Home OfficeExisting plans allow for an increase in police support, immigrationand prison service staff of about 2500.   Economies in prisonmanpower will go towards reducing overtime and minimising thestaffing requirements of new prisons.   Savings in the rest of theHome Office will come from streamlining and efficiency, froma transfer, to be negotiated, to local authority control ofpolice recruit training and possibly from police tele-communicationsservices, and from privatisation of domestic services at thePolice, Fire Service and Home Defence Colleges.11.   The Lord Chancellor&apos;s DepartmentsNew savings of 600 posts (6$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post) have beenoffered in LCD through improved efficiency.   Growth of about350 staff has been approved in the Crown (criminal) Courts todeal with the increasing volume of detected crime.   Excluding thisapproved growth, the overall saving between 1 4 79 and 1 4 84 is6.5$.   The Land Registry&apos;s new savings of 225 posts fromimplementation of various efficiency measures is offset by approvedgrowth of 250 man-years to cope with the most recent extensionsof areas of compulsory registration.   Excluding growth the overallsaving between 1 4 79 and 1 4 84 is 15.5$.   In the Public TrusteeOffice, new savings of 48 posts (15$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post)have been identified as a consequence of the installation of acomputer.   No further savings in the Public Record Office areproposed.12.   Department of Education and ScienceSavings of 95 staff have been offered from simplification ofprocedures and controls over education building, reduction infunctions relating to building development, student awards andteacher probation and in-service training, and reduction in.commonservice staff.   To reach the proposed target, additional savingsof 146 staff in statistics, Architects and Buildings Branch, andfrom general efficiency measures - including HM Inspectorate ofSchools and its supporting staff - will be necessary.13.   Office of Arts and LibrariesWhile new savings of 10$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post will be made inthe staff of the Office itself, further savings (provisionallyset at 4$) in the two departmental museums (the Victoria andAlbert and Science Museums) will depend on the outcome of proposedscrutinies.14.   Department of Health and Social Security/OPCSSome 8,000 of the savings will come from 3 major policy changes:Employers&apos; Statutory Sick Pay, Unified Housing Benefit and SimplifiedSupplementary Benefit.    Substantial areas still remain in thedepartment where Rayner-type scrutinies and other reviews shouldproduce efficiency savings beyond those already offered, eg theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstudy of the payment of benefit to the unemployed.   The 2,400 staffin the Special Hospitals have been exempted from cuts.   Growth of s6,742 has been approved chiefly to meet the currently assumedlevels of unemployment.   Allowance also needs to be made for thestaff for extra Supplementary Benefit claims arising from theabolition of the Earnings Related Supplement.   The new savingsoffered for OPCS are based mainly on reductions in functions,but the scope is limited by the timescale for processing the1981 Census.   The target savings of 5$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-postis based on the expectation that a reduction in the scope of thesurvey work should be feasible as a consequence of a currentRayner review.15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s DepartmentsNew savings of 10$ of 1 4 80 staff-in-post are proposed. Traditionbudget discretion will be required in deciding on the allocationof savings between these departments.   Some of the savings willcome from improvements in efficiency, others will depend onbudgetary decisions.   Above average savings were made between1 4 79 and 1 4 80, but further efficiency savings should be possiblIt must be assumed that by the end of the target period theGovernment*s policies will have reduced the burden of taxationand the number of people in tax.16. Lord President*s DepartmentsCivil Service DepartmentSavings amounting to 21$ between 1 4 79 and 1 4 84 willcome from a general cutting back of functions, includingcomputer bureau work, reducing the involvement of theCivil Service Commission in recruitment of non-mobilestaff and abolishing the regional network;   and fromincreased efficiency.Civil Service Catering OrganisationA proposal that canteen staff should count against thenumbers in the departments where they work is beingconsidered;   if adopted, it will be for each departmentto decide whether to save staff in this field. Otherwise,the savings will be found by closing some staffrestaurants.HMSOHMSO is to reduce its range of activities (excludingParliamentary printing). New savings offered amountto 29.9$ of 1 4 80 staff-inrpost.COIThe new savings will come from privatisation of filmswork, and some withdrawal from activities with consequentialsavings in administration and support staff.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL17. Paymaster General&apos;s OfficeAlthough the increasing work-load has been contained as far aspossible, growth of 147 posts has been approved.    Savings willbe achieved by the introduction of more efficient working methodssuch as acceptance of data in a computer readable format. Theoverall percentage reduction from 1 4 79 to 1 4 84 (exclusiveof growth) amounts of 5.2$,18. Scottish Office/Scottish Secretary&apos;s Other DepartmentsThe prisons and the State Hospital have been exempted from cuts.For the rest of the department, the savings proposed amount to5fo of the staff-in-post at 1 4 80.    This is based on an assessmentof the reductions in functions and efficiency savings requiredin analogous Whitehall departments, but taking into account thesmall scale of operation of many parts of the Scottish Office,and the level of cuts previously agreed.   Although small savingsare proposed in the Scottish Secretary&apos;s Other Departments theseare not sufficient to offset growth previously approved in theScottish Courts Administration to deal with an increasing workload,and in the Department of the Registers of Scotland to implementthe Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979.   The net increase instaff from 1 4 79 is 124.19. Welsh OfficeThe savings proposed amount to 5$ of the staff-in-post at 1 4 80.This is based on an assessment of the reductions in functionsand efficiency savings required in analogous Whitehall departments,but taking into account the small scale of operations of theWelsh Office and the level of cuts previously agreed.20. Northern Ireland OfficePruning of the UK Civil Service staff to produce new savings of17 staff is considered the maximum possible in view of thedepartment&apos;s close connection with problems of law and order.21. Other departmentsApproved growth in some small legal departments because of increasingworkloads and in the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produceas a result of EEC policies, is slightly greater than the savingsproposed, with a net increase of 136 on 1 4 79.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX BImproving EfficiencyThe drive for greater efficiency in Departments is producing encouraging resultsso far.     In particular, the disciplines applied in Rayner scrutinies haveproduced very good value.    But the scope for improvement is still clearlyvery great.2. The following points stand out:a. Rayner-type scrutinies of manpower-intensive areas are both producingconsiderable savings in their own right (for example, 1800 proposed in theRevenue and Customs and Excise in the past year) and providing pointersto further studies.    The evidence so far strongly suggests that there is a lotmore to find.    The present scrutiny of payments to the unemployed mayproduce very substantial savings in expenditure on staff and administration.b. reviews by the CSD and departments of existing formulae for translatingwork-loads into staffing needs, especially where repetitive clericaltasks can be measured, suggest that there is widespread scope for tightercomplementing.    For example, the Department of Employment expects to savearound 1000 by this means;c. substantial savings are being attained from service-wide reviews ofcommon functions.    The review of statistics is likely to recommend savingsoverall of about 20%.    The CSD review of messenger services is findingpossible savings of 30-50%.    Similar studies of supporting services inresearch and development establishments, typing, training andtelecommunications have begun;d. it is worthwhile to get managers of large establishments to conducttheir own reviews.    The Ministry of Defence have launched a major programmeof this kind;e. there is scope for substantial savings from streamlining networksof regional and local offices.    Successful exercises in MAFF, Customs andExcise and Transport are being followed by others in PSA and DOE.3. While departments have been understandably reluctant to set targets for suchexercises in advance, it should be borne in mind that:i. there are still 3&apos;1 years to go;ii. not many plans have yet been made for efficiency programmes after1 April 1982;iii. there are no signs so far of diminishing returns.All this supports the view that there are still large additional savings to befound from improving efficiency if the pressure is sustained.CONFIDENTIAL

It will be essentialboth to minimise demands for additional staff and to make further savings by1 April 1982 if the numbers are to continue to decline and the 1 April 1984 targetis to be assured.
