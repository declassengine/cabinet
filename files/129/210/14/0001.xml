SECRETOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 6429 October 1980COPY NO   g gCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE CHANGESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury1. This memorandum reports the outcome of discussions in MISC 47,except for the final discussions of Northern Ireland and agriculture on whichwe will report orally.2. C(80) 58 set out increases in expenditure compared with the MarchWhite Paper revalued of  2, 724 million (at late  1979 prices) in 1981-82;and more in later years.    It proposed reductions of   1, 610 million in pro-grammes (other than social security which was to be discussed separately)as a step towards bringing the total back to the aim, agreed in July, of holdingto the March White Paper figures, less the benefit from the EuropeanCommunity contributions.3. As a result cf discussions in the last week we now accept a largerincrease for employment measures, so bringing the total increase to 2, 780 million in 1981-82.    We have also agreed to abate our proposedreductions by  125 million in that year mainly in respect of health(paragraph B(ii)):  the total reductions in programmes which we now proposeis  1,485 million in 1981-82,    The changes are summarised in Table 1.4. We have reached full agreement with the Ministers concerned onprogrammes where the reductions amount to  273 million.     Also, on theprogrammes where there are issues unresolved, we have reached agreementwith the Ministers concerned on reductions of  92 million, taking into accountthe abatement referred to above.     With the other changes already agreedbefore circulation of C(80) 58, the total reductions agreed so far amount to 642 million.5. This leaves still at icsue:-i.     Further increase for employment measures of  90 million,and increases of  20 million on Wales, proposed by the respectiveSecretaries of State.ii.     Further reductions of  800 million on programmes discussedbut not agreed.1SECRET
SECRETiii.     Reductions being discussed today with the Ministersconcerned of  43 million.The position in respect of the programmes with issues outstanding issummarised in Table 2.A.    AGREED PROGRAMMESio   Environment (including Property Services Agency (PSA))6. The Secretary of State accepts our proposals for reductions totalling 173 million in 1981-82, but wishes to leave open the distribution betweenhis programmes (apart from P&amp;A, where colleagues will need to beconsulted on the implications of these proposals).    On housing, he wisheshis colleagues to recognise that, if as he proposes no further cuts are madein capital, this is likely to require a rent guideline for next year indicatingan average rent increase of  3.25 (as against  2.85 implied by theCmnd 7841 figures).ii. Transport7. The Minister of Transport has accepted the proposals for hisDepartment in C(80) 58 (despite their impact on the private sectorconstruction industry), provided that reductions elsewhere do not fall short.He has doubts about carrying forward the capital cuts to later years, but wehope to reach agreement with him on this also, following the Cabinetdiscussion.iii. Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Aid8.        Foreign Office Ministers have accepted the 2 per cent cut on thetotals for their programmes (including aid) for all three years, withdiscretion to adjust between programmes.iv. Office of Arts and Libraries9. For the arts, after discussion we are prepared to accept  11 millionreductions in each year, instead of the  15 million proposed earlier, giventhe cuts already made in this small programme and the damage any biggerreduction might do; the Chancellor of the Duchy has agreed to the 11 million.B.    ISSUES FOR DECISIONi. Education10. We have proposed further cuts in 1981-82, additional to the 85 million agreed by Cabinetin July, of  61 million as the education shareof the 1 per cent reduction in local authority current spending, and 30 million which is 2 per cent of the remaining cash-controlled Departmentof Education and Science programmes (universities, local authority capital,2SECRET
secretscience).    We proposed that this total cut of  176 million next year shouldbe carried forward into the later years in reductions of  236 million and 241 million,11. The Secretary of State is particularly reluctant to accept any of theextra  61 million proposed reduction on local authority current (schoolsand further education).    On his other programmes, the July cut( 24 million) amounted to l\ per cent, and he is prepared to find a further\ per cent( 8 million) making 2 per cent in all, provided that colleaguesaccept the full 2 per cent cuts; but this falls short of the extra  30 millionwe are seeking.12. We need cuts from education on the scale proposed, to achieve ouroverall target.    In particular we cannot make the further 1 per centreduction in local authority current spending unless education takes itsshare.    We therefore invite colleagues to agree that:-a. in 1981-82 local authority education expenditure should takethe full 1 per cent further cut ( 61 million);b. also in that year other cash-limited education programmesshould take the proposed 2 per cent further cut  ( 30 million),rather than the j per cent ( 8 million) proposed by the Secretaryof State;c. the total cut of  176 million for 1981-82 should be carriedforward into later years in reductions of  236 million and 241 million.ii. Health13. Because  100 million of expected income (mainly accident charges)has been lost, the net provision for health is at present by that amount lessthan the Cmnd 7841 figures which have so far been taken as a Manifestocommitment.    We proposed a further reduction of  125 million as thehealth share of the 2 per cent cut in cash-controlled programmes.14. The Secretary of State wishes to avoid this  225 million cut, byraising this amount instead through an increase in the National Insurancehealth contribution.    He regards this as politically and socially moreacceptable than cutting services or raising prescriptions or other charges;it would make the same contribution to the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement and would avoid placing a bigger burden on the sick and theelderly.15. We cannot accept this argument.    The National Insurance contribution,from which there is an allocation towards health costs, is essentially a formof tax, and should bo considered as such.    It does not count towards stayingwithin the Cmnd 7841 targets for public expenditure.    Volume spending onhealth cannot be exempted from making its contribution towards ourexpenditure target.3secret
secret16. We are prepared to accept that the  100 million loss of expectedcharges cannot now reasonably be made up, so that the health programmeshould bear only the standard 2 per cent cut in cash-controlled expenditure(and 1 per cent reduction in local authority current expenditure}, with thesame reduction carried forward into the later years.    This would stillprovide for some growth in the total National Health Service programme.17. We therefore invite colleagues to agree that:-a. the health programme should not be required to carry the 100 million loss of receipts frcm charges, which should bereinstated;b. it should be required to find its share of the 2 per centreduction in cash-controlled programmes ( 126 million) and1 per cent of local authority current spending ( 12 million)in 1981-82;c. this  138 million reduction should be carried forward intothe two later years.iii. Employment18. The Secretary of State for Employment has proposed expenditure onspecial employment measures (including unified vocational preparation) of 624 million in 1981-82 and similar amounts in later years.    The existingprovision for 1981-82 is  323 million,19. To continue the existing measures on their present basis would costan additional  112 million.    If the Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP)were to be expanded in order to maintain the current undertakings forunemployed school leavers and other young people,  this would cost a further 97 million.    The remaining  92 million proposed by the Secretary of Statewould allow for the improvement of this and other schemes, in particular,the Job Release Scheme and Community Enterprise Programme.20. Against this, the Secretary of State is offering savings on his otherprogrammes of  32 million in 1981-82 (and higher figures in the later years)as well as the general 2 per cent cut in cash limited programmes and the1 per cent cut in locnl authority current expenditure. His net additional bidis therefore  269 million in 1981-82.21. Of these additions to the programme, we are prepared to agree to the 112 million to continue existing schemes, and the  97 million to meet YOPundertakings.    To offset this, we think the Secretary of State should find 42 million net savings ( 10 million more than he has offered), either byreducing the rate of support under the Short-Time Working Scheme or byfurther savings elsewhere.    This would give total addition of  167 million,with equivalent figures for the later years of  203 million and  189 million.It falls  102 million short of the Secretary of State&apos;s net bid for 1981-82, butin our view this is the limit of what can be afforded on this programme with-out even more drastic reductions than we have proposed elsewhere.4secret
secret22. Accordingly we invite colleagues to agree that the net additions forspecial employment measures should be  167 million for 1981-82, 203 million for 1982-83 and  189 million for 1983-84.iv. Defence23. Our proposal here was for specific cuts of  312 million in each yearin addition to the standard 2 per cent of cash-limited expenditure, making fortotal savings of  500 million a year.24. The Secretary of State for Defence has agreed to consider theimplications of accepting the standard 2 per cent cut in cash-limitedexpenditure.    But ha is firmly opposed to any additional specific cut in viewof its likely effect on operational capability.    He considers that our inter-national commitments require sustained real growth in defence spending in1981-82; points out that he has already been obliged to make substantialeconomies, and to accommodate the Trident programme within the existingprovision for Defence; and is concerned about the employment and industrialimplications of deeper cuts*25. The Defence programme grew by 3 per cent in 1979-80 and seemslikely, through cverspending, to achieve 3 per cent again this year. Theeffect of our proposal would be to break with 3 per cent growth in 1981-82but allow some resumed growth in later years.    Against the background ofacute economic difficulties this is, and would we believe be seen as, a modestcontribution from a  10 billion programme (comprising /6th of total centralgovernment expenditure).    Performance against the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation target would remain well above average; and the proportion ofCross National Product devoted to Defence would continue to be higher thanany major European ally.26. We invite our colleagues to agree that:-a. Defence should not be exempted from the general 2 per centcut in cash-limited expenditure.b. In addition there should be specific cuts of  312 million ineach year, bringing the total saving on the Defence programmeup to  500 million a year.v. Scotland27. We proposed a reduction of  150 million in the Scottish Officeprogramme, consisting of formula cuts based on the proposals for otherDepartments (then put at  60 million for 1981-82), and an extra cut of 90 million because the Scottish share of public expenditure on comparableservices is much larger than is justified by relative need, as indicated bythe Needs Assessment Study.    The Secretary of State is prepared to make theformula cuts, but considers that any additional reduction for Scotland alonewould be politically disastrous.   His assessment of what cuts on this scalewould imply is set out in C(80) 62.5secret
secret28. We recognise the political difficulties of a conspicuous extra cutin the Scottish programme.    But we have to judge the programmes wherethere is a relatively good case for finding contributions to the overalltarget, and there is good evidence that the public expenditure baselineprovides relatively well for Scotland.    Accordingly we invite colleaguesto agree that:-a. in addition to formula cuts, the Scottish programme shouldbe reduced by  90 million in 1981-82;b. this should be carried forward into similar cuts (about  140 million a year) in 1982-83 and 1983-84.vi. Wales29. The Secretary of State for Wales has agreed to accept his share offormula cuts based on the proposals for other Departments.    But he hasasked for an additional  20 million in both 1981-82 and 1983-84 for factorybuilding in areas affected by steel closures.    We recognise that the positionwill be difficult, but it will be equally difficult elsewhere in the UnitedKingdom and we see no case for special treatment for Wales.    We thereforerecommend acceptance of the figures in Table 1.CONCLUSION30. We seek agreement to our proposals including both the general cutsand the specific cuts in programmes set out above.    The resultant netchanges in the programmes affected are set out in Table 3.GHJBTreasury Chambers29 October 1980secret
