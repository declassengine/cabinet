CONFIDENTIALS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO81CABINETCOMMISSION DIRECTIVE UNDER ARTICLE 90 OF THE TREATYOF ROMEMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilTHE ISSUE1. We need to decide whether to challenge a Commission Directive in theEuropean Court of Justice under Article 173 of the Treaty of Rome.    If wewant to mount a direct challenge we must institute proceedings no later than22 September to meet the two-month deadline prescribed in that Article.Contingent pleadings, summarised at Annex A, have been prepared to this end.2. The Directive (no 80/723), which was adopted by the Commission inJuly under Article 90 of the Rome Treaty, is designed to bring greater trans-parency into the financial relations between the member states and their publicundertakings.    It will enable the Commission to examine these financialrelations in order to assess whetheranynational aids or subsidies have beengranted contrary to the provisions of the Treaty.3. The adoption of this Directive has created a conflict between ourindustrial and commercial interest in supporting a measure which could help toimprove our industries&apos; competitiveness and our constitutional and legalinterest in seeing that the Commission do not gain power at the expense of theCouncil of Ministers.4. Following correspondence among the colleagues concerned, theMinisterial Sub-Committee on European Questions of the Defence and OverseaPolicy Committee (OD(E)) accordingly met under my chairmanship on15 September to consider whether the United Kingdom should challenge theDirective. Since we were unable to resolve the conflict of interests I wasinvited to bring the issue to the attention of the Cabinet.THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST A CHALLENGE5. The case for a challenge may be summarised as folio ws:-C(80) 5316 September 19801CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi. The legal argument briefly rehearsed at Annex A is essentiallyabout a transfer of power from the Council to the Commission and henceraises issues which go wider than the Directive itself.ii. If we do not challenge the Directive now we will not be able to doso in the event that the Commission decide to amend the Directive toextend it to sectors now excluded such as energy or to require the pre-notification of aids.iii. Confirmation of Commission powers in this area might precludeconcurrent Council action under Article 94 and would preclude the useby the Council of Article 235 in the same field (because power would bedeemed to exist elsewhere in the Treaty).iv. The Solicitor General has advised that we have a substantial andrespectable case to put before the Court and that, while any challenge isbound to carry some risk, we have a good fighting chance ofsucceeding.6. The case against a challenge may be summarised as follows:-i. Given the relative openness of the Government&apos;s relations withthe public sector, we have little if anything to lose in terms of thedomestic effects of the Directive.    Our decision to sever the linkbetween the British National Oil Corporation and the National OilAccount, once implemented, would remove much of the sensitivity fromany later extension of the Directive&apos;s scope to the energy sector.ii. The Directive&apos;s main impact is likely to be felt in France andItaly, whose opaque state aid arrangements often operate to thedisadvantage of our industry.    It thus represents one positive, iflimited, step towards redressing the imbalance between the alreadyexposed United Kingdom position and the far less transparent arrange-ments in other member states.    Since there is no prospect of theCouncil agreeing to take action in this area we should not seek toinhibit the Commission from doing something which is in our interest.iii. A challenge would conflict with our repeated expressions ofconcern to see the Commission take more effective action against thesubsidies given by other member states and could weaken the force ofany future representations we make to the Commission on this subject.IIt might also be difficult to defend to sectors of British industry,including the fishermen and farmers, who see themselves as victims ofabuses in other member states,iv.     There is a risk that the Court could endorse the Commission&apos;saction and adopt a dynamic interpretation of the Commission&apos;s powerswhich would make it more difficult to oppose their future expansion indirections contrary to our interests.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE ATTITUDES OF OTHER MEMBER STATES7. When OD(E) discussed this question the attitudes of France and Italywere still unclear.    It now appears that both have decided to challenge theDirective on broadly the same constitutional grounds as those we might putforward, though each might advance some arguments with which the UnitedKingdom would not wish to be associated.    All other member states arecontent with the Directive.THE OPTIONS8. We can:-i. Take no action against the Directive, leaving the Italians andFrench to bring the issue to the Court on grounds of their own choosing.ii. Intervene later in any actions brought by Italy or France, inwhich event the terms of our intervention would to a large extent bedictated by the pleadings of the parties to the action.iii. Mount a direct challenge ourselves before 22 September.In the OD(E) discussion opinion was divided between courses i. and iii  ; no-one saw much merit in course ii CONCLUSION9. I invite my Cabinet colleagues to decide which of the foregoing coursesthe United Kingdom should adopt.SCivil Service Department16 September 19803CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX ASUMMARY OF MAIN ARGUMENT ADVANCED IN DRAFT PLEADINGi.     The proper scope and function of Article 90(3)are to empower the Commission to act where anational measure results in an infringement, inthe case of a public undertaking, of the Treaty,and especially of the competition rules inArticles 85 and 86.ii.     Article 90(3) does not confer general law-makingpowers on the Commission.    This is evident fromthe wording of the Article and, subject to verylimited exceptions, from the absence from theTreaty as a whole of any legislative powersexercisable by the Commission other than delegatedpowers.iii.      In any event, Article 90(3) does not confer law-making powers in respect of state aids. Wherethe Treaty expressly confers a specific competenceon a Community institution, that competence cannotbe exercised by another institution.    Any rulesabout aids to undertakings and their notificationto the Commission which are necessary for theapplication of the rules on state aids in Articles92 and 93 should be made by the Council underArticle 94.iv.     Article 90(1) is aimed at legislative measures oradministrative practices in member states.    It isnot apt to cover individual executive acts towhich the directive purports to apply.CONFIDENTIAL
