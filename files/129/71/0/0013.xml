4-7SECRETC.(54) 313 COPY NO.  /P16th October, 1954CABINETREMUNERATION OF minister&apos;s memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerBefore the legislative programme of the new session is decided on,my colleagues may like to give some preliminary consideration to thequestion of Ministers&apos; remuneration.    (I use this term to include the remuneration of the Lord Chairman of Committees, the Chairman and deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, and the Leader of the Opposition.)2.   The present temporary abatement of senior Ministers&apos; salarieswas announced by the Prime Minister as being &quot;limited to the period of re-armament or three years, whichever ends the first&quot; (Official Report,6th November, 1951, Column 70).    That abatement can be ended at any time without legislation.    But, apart from that, nothing material can be done without legislation, either to increase Ministerial salaries or to enlargethe present limits within which Ministers in the Commons are entitled todraw Parliamentary salary or allowances in addition to their ministerial salaries.    The present statutory position is set out in the Appendix.3.        There is no doubt that, by modern standards, ministerial salaries - especially those of Parliamentary Secretaries - are much too low.    There is also a strong case for extending to all Ministers in the commons the right to draw Parliamentary salary, since they work fortheir constituents and incur considerable Parliamentary expenses.    Atpresent some get neither remuneration for the former nor tax-relief for the latter, and others get only half what they should.4.        The Select Committee recommended that all Ministers in the commons should draw the full Parliamentary salary (which they saidshould be  1,500).    The debate on 13th May last showed that there was general support for some improvement for Ministers, particularlyjunior Ministers,5.        But it is almost impossible to do anything worth while for the junior Minister alone without producing a nonsensical relationship between him and his seniors.    It follows, therefore, that if anything is to be done for junior Ministers, something must be done all the way up,6.        Many different schemes could be devised.    As a tentativeproposal for dealing with Ministers up to the  5,000 level (i. e, , leaving aside the English Law Officers and the Prime Minister) , I would suggest that all Ministerial salaries of less than  3,000 might beincreased by  500, and that all Ministers in the Commons should beentitled to draw the full Parliamentary salary, at present  1,000,    Iwould not advise extending to them also the right to draw the newSessional Allowance, but the legislation would be so expressed as toentitle them to draw the full Parliamentary salary, whatever it may bre from time to time.
7.        This plan would produce, to take as examples the standard casesof Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of State and senior Minister, thefollowing re suit:-ExistingParlia-MinisterialSalary mentarySalary SuggestedParlia-MinisterialSalary mentarySalarySenior Ministers        5,000 Nil(Temp. 4,000)Ministers of 3,000StateParliamentary 1,500Secretaries5005005,000i,0002,0001,0001,0001,0008.        There are obvious political difficulties about even so modesta scheme as this.    The timing of the legislation, and of its cominginto operation, would have to be carefully considered in relation toother matters.    But I cannot believe that the difficulties of dealingwith the subject justify us in delaying consideration of the arithmeticof a reasonable structure of salaries.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.15th October, 1954.

Any Minister in the Commons may surrender the whole ofMs Ministerial salary and draw the full Parliamentary salary instead,with tax relief on Parliamentary expenses up to  1,000 accordingly.This is frequently done by Junior Whips.5, A pension of  2,000 is payable to an ex-Prime minister whether or not he sits in Parliament; but it cannot be drawn concurrently with a Ministerial salary or with the Leader of the Opposition^ salary.If the pension is actually drawn, the holder&apos;s position is the same, asregards Parliamentary salary, etc., as that of the Leader of the ,Opposition.    It should doubtless remain so, and the pension shouldcontinue to be at the same figure as the latter&apos;s salary.
