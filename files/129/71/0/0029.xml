It is issued for the personal use of ...............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 3293rd November, 1954CABINETDEFENCE policy note by the Prime minister after the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on July 27 the Commonwealth secretary undertook, at my request and in the absence of the Minister of Defence, a further review of defence programmes to determine whether any additional adjustmentswere called for, beyond those recommended in the Report of the Defence PolicyCommittee (C. (54) 250), and also to consider what further reductions might besecured in expenditure on defence during 1955.In this review the Commonwealth Secretary had the assistance of Mr. Sandysand Mr. Birch; and the Service Ministers and Chiefs of Staff were called into consultation. Lord Alexander was also associated with the enquiry in its later stages; and I myself presided over the final meetings.In the attached Report the results of the enquiry are submitted for the cabinet&apos;s decision.  I endorse the recommendations made in the Report.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,2nd November, 1954.
report we have carried out the further review of defence policy which was envisaged by the Cabinet at their meeting on July 27 (C.C. (54) 54th Conclusions, Minute 4,Conclusion (4)). In doing so, we have considered whether the changes in the shape of our Armed Forces, which were recommended by the Defence PolicyCommittee (C. (54) 250), would result in the best apportionment of resourcesbetween the various elements comprising our defence effort. We have also considered whether any further economies could be secured which would havethe effect of reducing defence expenditure in 1955 below the figure of 1,550 millions (without making provision for the costs of our forces in Germany).2. Our work has been assisted by the discussions we have held with theService Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, and by the supplementary information with which we have been provided on certain aspects of defence programmes.3. We are in general agreement with the new strategic concept outlined by the Chiefs of Staff in C. (54) 249, and have been guided by it in making ourreview.4. In considering how to relate our defence expenditure to the requirementsof the new strategic concept, we have applied the following priorities:  &apos;(i) The minimum forces necessary to carry out essential Commonwealthcommitments in peace-time.(ii) Forces which would directly assist us in surviving the supreme openingphase of a third World War.(iii) (Subject to the essential needs of these two categories) Forces which,though making no direct contribution to our survival in the openingphase of a major war, would be essential in the ensuing period of lessintensive warfare.(iv) Expenditure on forces which do not fall into any of the above prioritycategories should as far as practicable be brought to an end.These priorities correspond with those which were laid down by the Minister ofDefence in the recent Radical Review of defence expenditure and they accord with the strategic appreciation of the Chiefs of Staff in C. (54) 249.5. Our defence policy is founded on the assumption that the United Statesand other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) willbe with us in any major war. Our plans must, therefore, take into account thatour forces will be part of a larger Allied whole. But within the alliance our forces must always be designed to provide the maximum protection for the UnitedKingdom for which we have a special responsibility.6. We are satisfied from our examination that the existing defence programmes, taken as a whole, and including the changes which the service ministers have proposed in C. (54) 250, comply broadly with the Chiefs of Staffstrategic concept (C. (54) 249) and also with the priorities and other considerations set out above. However, as the result of our review, we see the need for furtheradjustments in certain sectors of Service programmes.
7. We have no radical alterations to suggest in the programme of the Army.The main problem which we see in the Air Force programme is the degree of emphasis to be given to the development of the medium bomber force; and thiswill not materially affect the level of their expenditure until after 1955.Somewhat different considerations apply to the future shape of the Navy. TheFleet could not play any direct part in stemming the first onslaughts of nuclearair attack in the opening intensive phase of war; but on the Navy would fallincreasingly the task of assuring the due arrival of vital supplies from abroad.8. The three Services are equal in status and honour and will remain so.But each must vary in size and character as changes take place in the science of warand the course of world events. In the new strategic conditions, the relative importance of sea power in our defences is evidently diminishing and there is no sign that this trend will be arrested. There can be no question of having a largerNavy than we heed, or can afford; and we must make the best use of existingmaterial. It is natural that the Navy should wish to have their share in air power,which is growing in importance. The cost of the Fleet Air Arm, however-already about  70 millions a year and expected to rise sharply appears to impose a burden disproportionate to results. Moreover, the role of the aircraft carrier isalready restricted through the ever-increasing range of shore-based aircraft.THE navy the Fleet Air Arm9. Earlier plans provided for an operational force of two heavy and threelight aircraft carriers. Under the Admiralty&apos;s revised plans, the number of lightcarriers for convoy protection has been reduced from three to two. We considerthat two light aircraft carriers would be insufficient for the important task of protecting our Atlantic lifelines, upon which in the later stages of a war our lifemight depend. In this role, moreover, carrier-borne aircraft cannot effectively bereplaced by shore-based aircraft.10. We therefore recommend that, whilst the proposed size and composition of the carrier force should be maintained, the two heavy carriers should be mannedand equipped for the escort role only and that, at any rate in peacetime, theircomplement of aircraft should be reduced to that of the light carriers. substantial economies would flow from the consequent reduction in the numbers of aircraft to be maintained on these ships.11. It would be necessary to secure the agreement of N.A.T.O. before theseproposals could be put into effect, but we should not be deterred by the possibility that this may re-open the question of our share in the Naval Command structure ofN.A.T.O. As we should be retaining four aircraft carriers with the Fleet, butputting them to better use, we have a good answer if any proposal were made torCrOpen the question of command.
4 Q12. About half the cost of naval aviation as a whole is incurred on thepurchase and maintenance of aircraft. This heavy expenditure is mainly due tothe high wastage rate and to the high proportion of aircraft behind the front line.Under these two heads the Admiralty are willing to accept further adjustments intheir plans which would produce a saving next year of  3^ millions. If the cabinet also approve the reduction of the complement of the heavy aircraft carriers whichis recommended in paragraph 10, a further saving of  2 millions would accruenext year; and larger economies might then ensue through a diminution in thenumber of aircraft required behind the front line. It may, however, be necessaryto accept the postponement of some of these savings in order to mitigate the impact which sharply reduced orders for naval aircraft would have on employmentin the aircraft industry, especially in Belfast.13. We also recommend that the Minister of Defence should arrange foran investigation to be made into the future strategic role of the Fleet Air Armand the longer-term plans for the development of new types of naval aircraft. this review should cover the possibility of further reducing the number of aircraftrequired to support the front-line strength of the Fleet Air Arm.Cruisers14. The present plan is to maintain ten cruisers in commission. We acceptthe importance of the peace-time role of the cruiser in police duties and in showingthe Flag. In our view, however, it should be possible to make more extensive useof our aircraft carriers for these duties.15. For prestige purposes and for having a vessel superior to the latestRussian cruiser we consider that Vanguard should be kept in commission as was originally intended by the Admiralty. As against this, we propose that two cruisersshould be put to reserve, so reducing our active cruiser strength from ten to eight.This substitution, we are assured, can be made without incurring a greater outlayin money or man-power.16. In making this proposal we have taken into account the steps now beingtaken to reduce the time required to commission ships in the first two classes ofwar reserve. We are informed that about two months would elapse before these ships could be made battle-worthy.Minesweepers17. Two hundred coastal and inshore mineweepers are under construction and the prototype of an ocean type is being laid down. The Admiralty proposedto place further orders for coastal minesweepers at the rate of ten a year. It hasbeen stated by the Chiefs of Staff in C. (54) 209 that the new strategic conceptrequires less emphasis on minesweeping. In D.P. (54) 12 the Admiralty indicated that building would be confined to those ships needed in war which would be most useful in peace and that nearly allthe future minesweeping programme would be suspended. We have therefore considered whether fresh orders for minesweeperscould not be suspended entirely; but we are informed that this would probably
lead to the closing down of the small shipyards which specialise in -this type of construction. The former Minister of Defence was willing to accept the reductionof new orders from forty to twenty-four. We recommend that his proposal beadopted and that the orders should be spread over four years. This will save 1J millions a year.Administrative Costs. 18. It should also be possible to reduce the overhead costs of the naval programme. The War Office have undertaken to reduce administrativeexpenditure by  10 millions. The former Minister of Defence supported theproposal of the Admiralty to aim at a corresponding saving of  3 millions. Weconsider that the Admiralty should do their utmost to achieve a saving of 5 millions under this head.THE army the Strategic Reserve19. The army programme provides for building up in the United kingdom strategic reserve equivalent to 2^ divisions. Apart from its military advantages,this will bring with it financial savings because the cost of maintaining these forces will be lower at home than abroad. For both these reasons, there must be no avoidable delay in lightening the overseas commitments of the Army on whichthe withdrawal of their troops to the United Kingdom depends. Now^that ourrelations with Egypt have improved, it may well be found possible to complete theevacuation of our bases in the Canal Zone more rapidly than has hitherto beenconsidered practicable, with possible further savings under this head. A new studyshould be made at once aiming at halving the time of withdrawal. The earliestpossible start should be made in reducing our forces in Korea and Hong Kong.The battalion which was recently sent to British Guiana is, on present plans, not due to be withdrawn until it can be replaced by a West Indian battalion, which itis hoped to form by the end of 1956. We are satisfied that it must remain therefor the time being but the possibility of withdrawing it earlier should be kept underreview.Colonial Forces20. Everything possible should be done to build up local Colonial forces inorder to reduce the demands on our own Army. We shall not get quick relief inthis way, but the point is of such importance that we consider this question should now be studied by Ministers and pursued as a deliberate policy. In this studywe suggest that special attention should be given to the possibility of strengtheningColonial police and security services. These are the front line of defence againstsubversion and we are informed that recent experience has revealed defects intheir organisation. Efficient police forces and Intelligence. Services are the best,way of smelling out and suppressing subversive movements at an early stage, andmay save heavy expenditure on military reinforcements. They are an insurancewe cannot afford to neglect.

The army programme provides for building up in the United kingdom strategic reserve equivalent to 2% divisions. Apart from its military advantages,this will bring with it financial savings because the cost of maintaining these forces will be lower at home than abroad. For both these reasons, there must be no avoidable delay in lightening the overseas commitments of the Army on whichthe withdrawal of their troops to the United Kingdom depends.

Anti-Aircraft Command21. We endorse the proposal to reduce the strength of Anti-aircraft command to ten regiments of Light Artillery. We are satisfied that this is theright course in the light of their relative ineffectiveness against targets of the speed and height of modern jet bombers. The 15,000 regulars and 80,000 territorialsthereby released will be absorbed into other units in the Regular and Territorialarmies. This reorganisation can, therefore, be presented as a redeployment ofthe Army&apos;s man-power designed to eliminate expenditure which in view of technical developments is no longer justified and to secure more effective service for the Army from this personnel.The Territorial Army22. We also endorse the role assigned by the War Office to the TerritorialArmy in war, namely to reinforce the British element in N.A.T.O., to provide for home Defence and to support the Civil Defence authorities in this country. Everyeffort should be made to improve the readiness for war of the Territorial army as a whole, and, in particular, of the two divisions assigned to N.A.T.O. Furthertraining for these two divisions on mobilisation will however be essential. unless such training can be carried out in a warning period in advance of the outbreakof war, these divisions will not be effective and except in dire emergency will notbe available for deployment in Europe in the decisive opening phase.Disbandinent of Units23. The Army is faced with an inevitable contraction in manpower whichwill reduce its strength by 35,000 men over the next two years. This makes the elimination of a number of units unavoidable. In all eighteen units are to be disbanded, including the second battalions of eight Regiments. Infantry battalionsas a whole are already under strength and, unpalatable though it is, we are satisfiedthat the reversion of all Regiments to a single battalion is unavoidable.THE AIR FORCEFighter Command24. The present establishment of the twenty-eight regular squadrons of fighter Command is 566 aircraft. It was previously intended to build up this force to a front line strength of 792 aircraft, organised in thirty-six squadrons.Under the Air Ministry&apos;s latest proposals expansion will continue more slowly,reaching a front line strength of 576 aircraft by March, 1956. At the same timethe proportion of all-weather to day fighters will grow until equal numbers ofeach are in service in March, 1957. Up to 1958 squadrons will be equipped withthe Hunter and Swift day fighters and the Javelin all-weather fighter; thereafterthey will be re-equipped with the new supersonic fighter or the thin-winged Javelin.25. The number of squadrons in Fighter Command will still increase fromtwenty-seven to thirty-six, though the number of aircraft in each squadron will
fall from twenty-two to sixteen. Before the war each Fighter squadron comprisedsixteen to eighteen aircraft and the Chiefs of Staff would have preferred to seethe unit strength of the squadron maintained at not less than eighteen aircraft infuture. But they consider it essential for the air defence of this country that our fighter Force should be deployed in at least thirty-six squadrons and they are agreed that the reduction in size of each squadron to sixteen aircraft can beaccepted as a calculated risk in the interests of economy. There will be certainoperational advantages in reducing the size of the squadron below the twenty-two aircrafts to which it has grown since the war; and the extent of this reduction inunit strength need not become widely known. If it should later become necessaryto expand the Fighter Force rapidly, it will be simpler to increase the size of eachsquadron than to form new squadrons. Suitable stations already exist for theadditional nine squadrons to be formed.26. We are satisfied by our examination that the revised programme forFighter Command should be approved. Whilst the Command will now increaseless in size, it will become a better-balanced and better-equipped force and willconsequently provide a more effective defence.Royal Auxiliary Air Force27. Under the new concept of war with its emphasis on the need forimmediate readiness and high efficiency of air defence at the outset we have examined the justification for retaining twenty Auxiliary Air Force squadrons at an expenditure of  3-4 millions in 1955-56, rising to a higher level onre-equipment.28. The complexity of modern fighter aircraft and of air defence techniqueis bound to increase. We do not think that these squadrons trained on a volunteerpart-time basis can form part of the front line on the outbreak of war, nor in thepresent organisation could more than a small proportion of their pilots find timeto reach, during peace-time training, a high enough standard to reinforce theregular squadrons immediately in war. It had been proposed that the number ofthese squadrons should, for economy&apos;s sake, be cut arbitrarily to ten squadrons.We see difficulty in defending logically such a proposal.29. We therefore recommend, despite the controversy which may be aroused,that in the light of the new strategic concept there should be a fundamental changein the organisation of these important volunteer units which have lost much of their military value through no fault of their members.30. The Air Ministry is now engaged in drawing up a scheme which, it ishoped, will provide economies while at the same time enabling the membersof the Auxiliary squadrons to make a more direct contribution to strategic requirements. In brief, the Auxiliary squadrons will no longer form part of theR.A.F. front line and will have no operational aircraft of their own. EachAuxiliary squadron will be linked for training purposes with a regular squadron in Fighter Command but will retain its identity, its Honorary Air Commodore, its
town headquarters and a flight of Meteors or Vampires to be used for training.&apos;The number of Auxiliary pilots in each squadron will be limited to 12. Besidestheir own training aircraft, the pilots will fly the modern operational aircraft ofthe regular squadron to which they are affiliated. The Auxiliary ground crew willcontinue as at present on their Auxiliary airfields, but will go to the regularsquadron to which they are affiliated for their annual period of continuous training.The Medium Bomber Force31. The present plan is to build up the medium bomber force to a front line strength of 240 aircraft. To do this and maintain the front line strength until 1962will require the purchase of 330 aircraft at a cost of about  160 millions. no provision will be made for a war reserve of these aircraft.32. The medium bomber force is of cardinal importance to the primary aim off our defence policy, namely, to discourage aggression by building up powerfuldeterrents. The main purpose of creating a British bomber force is to put us ina position to knock out the Soviet air bases from which attacks would be deliveredagainst this country. In addition it could be used to assist in holding back theRussian land offensive in Europe and could also undertake missions againststrategic targets, though we regard these roles as secondary in importance to thatof counter-attacking the Russian bomber bases.33. In four or five years&apos; time the Russians may be expected to dispose ofabout 850 jet bombers, some of which would be capable of bombing the UnitedStates,.and all of which would be able to attack the United Kingdom. The Sovietlong-range Air Force to-day occupies forty permanent bases, but we know of atleast 150 other airfields in European Russia and the Satellites from which these aircraft, and the new Russian jet bombers which are now coming into the Force,can operate in war. These bases will doubtless figure amongst the targets to be attacked by the American Strategic Air Force. But we cannot be sure whatpriority the Americans will accord to them in relation to other targets on theirlist of bombing objectives. Since the very survival of Britain would depend uponthe promptness and thoroughness of the counter-attack against these Russian air bases, it is essential that we should ourselves possess and control a bomber forcecapable of performing this vital task.34. In addition to their heavy bombers the Russians will have about 2,500light bombers deployed in Europe or Western Russia. These would probably beused in support of their land offensive. However, from bases situated west of theRiver Oder they could equally well be used against objectives in the UnitedKingdom.35. As things now stand, production capacity exists for the manufacture of four medium bombers a month. This is sufficient to build up a front line strengthof 144 aircraft by 1958, provided that continuity of production is maintained byordering another sixty-four bombers now. With our full support, the action necessary to place these orders has begun.
36. To achieve the planned front line strength of 240 by 1958, it would benecessary to expand the monthly production capacity from four to nine aircraft.The additional tooling required for this purpose can be installed at a cost of 800,000; and on our recommendation this is now being done. Whether or not it is decided to develop the medium bomber force beyond a front line strength of144, we must be able, in case of need, to accelerate the supply of these aircraft.37. We are agreed that the medium bomber force should have a very high priority; it is at the same time the main deterrent which the United Kingdom can provide and our main defence against nuclear attack. We are not in a position at this stage to recommend what the ultimate size of this force should be, but thisdecision need not be taken before the middle of 1955. We suggest that in themeantime a separate study should be made of the case for building up the frontline strength to 240 aircraft as contemplated in the plans of the Air Ministry.38. Ten operational bases are planned for the medium bomber force and twotraining airfields, at a total cost of  35 millions, of which  12 millions have alreadybeen spent. The advent of thermo-nuclear weapons makes dispersal more than ever important. We therefore advise most strongly against any reduction in thenumber of bases from which this vital force will operate, even if its numbers wereto be limited to 144 aircraft.Coastal Command39. Expenditure in the Air Ministry vote on shore-based aircraft for themetropolitan forces of Coastal Command and for the two squadrons based in theMediterranean will continue for several years at or near the present level of about 35 millions. The front-line strength of 130 aircraft will be maintained and a warreserve of about twenty land-based aircraft will be laid down representingreplacements likely to be necessary during the first months of hostilities. these forces fall short of N.A.T.O. requirements in war and we are satisfied that the plans now contemplated should not be scaled down.Transport Command40. The present plans for Transport Command are designed to provide the capacity required to carry out a movement equivalent to the transfer of a brigade group and its light equipment from the United Kingdom to the Middle East inseventy-two hours with certain assistance from charter aircraft. We are not entirely satisfied that the present programme gives sufficient emphasis to the contribution to be made by civil aircraft. We accept that it is necessary tomaintain in Transport Command specialised aircraft (e.g., the Beverley) for operational movements of troops and equipment by air. But for routine troopingmovements and for the reinforcement of overseas garrisons in peace maximum use should be made of civil aircraft operators. Means should, if possible, be found ofgiving active encouragement to the expansion and modernisation of their resources, with a view to reducing the number of aircraft which must be maintained
by the Government in order to fulfil the work of Transport Command. Wesuggest that the possibility of cutting down the costs of Transport Command by thismeans should be investigated by the Minister of Defence with the Service Ministers,and the Minister of Civil Aviation.Administrative Costs41. We consider that it should be possible to achieve a further saving of 3 millions by a more stringent overhaul of the administrative costs of the AirForce programme.Air Transport for the Army42. Arrangements have been made to set up a joint Army/Air Force unitto experiment in the use of helicopters in support of the Army in the field. we welcome this development, for it is more than ever important to enhance the mobility of the Army in the face of modern forms of attack.MINISTRY m OF SUPPLY43. The present estimate of  1,550 millions for the Defence Budget in 1955includes a provision of  145 millions for the research and development work carried out by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the Armed Forces. The wholefield of research and development programmes is under investigation by the defence research Policy Committee, whose report will soon be submitted to the Ministerof Defence. We have, therefore, not included this sector of the Defence Budget inour review. But it will be necessary, at the appropriate time, to consider whateconomies can be made in the costs of the Ministry of Supply.CONCLUSIONS44. Subject to the recommendations we have made above for further economies, we endorse the proposals contained in the report of the Defence. PolicyCommittee (C. (54) 250). If all our proposals were accepted by the Cabinet,defence expenditure in the financial year 1955-56 would be reduced to about 1,535 millions. This would still be  10 millions in excess of the figure which theChancellor of the Exchequer is willing to accept for next year&apos;s Defence Budget.We recommend that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of defence should jointly examine the possibility of closing this gap in scrutinising the detailed estimates which are now being prepared by the Service Departments.45. It should not be assumed that the proportionate share of the availablefunds Which it may be decided to allocate to each Service for 1955-56 will necessarily remain constant in Subsequent years. It is almost certain that theproposed re-equipment of Fighter and Bomber Commands and the introduction
of guided missiles will in due course entail a substantial increase in the Air Ministryvote. Therefore, unless the overall ceiling for defence expenditure is increased,a corresponding reduction in the expenditure of one or both of the other services will be necessary.46. In this connection we would emphasise the importance of setting thedefence programme on at least a three-year basis. This would enable theDepartments concerned to plan ahead with reasonable confidence and would avoidabrupt changes which inevitably lead to inefficiency and waste. We accordingly recommend that, when the present review relating to 1955-56 is completed, theamount to be made available to each Service in the two following years should be provisionally fixed without delay.
