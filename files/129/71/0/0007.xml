C........ i...^.********CABINET  Caruiiaervs^.COMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPMemorandum by Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations&quot;AMy colleagues will recall that on .14th April, 1953 (C.C. (53) 26th Conclusions,Minute 5), they invited me to preside over a Cabinet Committee to consider theproblems involved in the admission to full Commonwealth membership of colonial territories which might in the future attain the status of independence withinthe Commonwealth, and to submit recommendations. We have studied these problems carefully and have received a most valuable report, which I append,from a Committee of Permanent Under-Secretaries and other senior officials, ofwhich Sir Norman Brook was Chairman. Though we considered the problemsfrom a general standpoint, we had prominently in mind the constitutional progress being made by the Gold Coast, which is likely to be the leading case, and to qualify for full self-government by 1957, if not earlier.2. As has been stated in public more than once, the timetable for theconstitutional advance of a dependent territory and its ultimate attainment of full(or responsible) self-government is a matter for the decision of the United KingdomGovernment alone. The admission of such a territory to full membership of theCommonwealth, however, involves consultation with all the existing members.Full self-government in the sense used above is more than self-government merelyin internal affairs. It means in effect independent sovereign status or nationhoodin which no powers at all, even in regard to external affairs or defence, are retained by the United Kingdom Government. The attainment of full self-governmentin this sense and application for admission to membership are separate steps which need not necessarily be simultaneous, but would be likely in practice tocoincide (as was the case with Ceylon), or to be separated by a very short period.The principal question which we had to consider was whether it was practicable to devise for the emergent territories some status which would give them, at theproper time, full self-government within the Commonwealth, which they have beenrepeatedly promised, without bringing up the question of membership. What,then, does membership involve? We concluded that, in the final analysis,membership of the Commonwealth could be held to involve only (i) the right toattend meetings of Prime Ministers at which foreign affairs, defence, and constitutional matters are discussed and to participate in the day-to-day exchanges of information on these subjects, which take place continuously; and (ii) the rightof direct access to The Queen.3. We came to the conclusion that notwithstanding the primg facieattractions of a second class of Commonwealth membership, which wouldwithhold these rights and perhaps also some measure of control over their external relations from those countries within it, the arguments against such a concept aredecisive. They may be summarised as follows. Most candidates for commonwealth membership would be unwilling to accept an inferior status,especially as it would be impossible to devise any absolute tests of qualifications for membership. Unless their national aspirations could be met to their ownsatisfaction some would undoubtedly secede from the Commonwealth rather thanaccept second-class membership. (The Governor of the Gold Coast has given itas his opinion that the Gold Coast would certainly do this.) Even if they did not46926 b59
do scy their discontent would almost certainly be exploited by others, notablyIndia and the Soviet Union. If,.as would be quite possible, they were admitted to membership of the United Nations without being full members of theCommonwealth, other Powers would undoubtedly make strenuous and insidiousefforts to draw them away from the Commonwealth circle, and such efforts wouldprobably succeed. However uncomfortable it may be to have some of the emergentterritories as full Commonwealth partners, we are quite clear that the wiser course is to admit them to a status of nominal equality, and seek from the start to ensurethat, through sharing in that intimate exchange of views and information on foreignpolicy which marks relations between members of the Commonwealth, they willremain within our own sphere of influence. &apos;-      -4. Although it would be idle to deny that the inclusion of men of differentorigins and traditions must alter the character of the family relationship which hasin the past been so very valuable a feature of Commonwealth consultation, we donot feel. that any further extension of full Commonwealth membership neednecessarily impair the closeness of the partnership between the older and moreinfluential members. In order, however, to preserve the closeness of thispartnership, we may have to discriminate rather more in practice between these andthe other members in our relations with them. This, however, will be only the continuation of an existing tendency, and experience with India, Pakistan and ceylon has proved that such a discrimination can be managed without serious effects. The time has long since passed when &quot;the Dominions&quot; could betreated as indistinguishable members of a homogeneous group. If the membership is further increased, we shall doubtless have to develop still further the existing practice of treating each particular country on its individual merits; and there willprobably be an increase of Commonwealth Meetings confined to groups of countries on a regional or functional basis as distinct from &quot; plenary &quot; meetings.5. My colleagues will realise if they endorse our recommendation, that thereis no alternative to a policy of sponsoring for full membership emergent countrieswhen they attain a fully self-governing status.6. If that policy has to be applied to the Gold Coast within the next few years,the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland will certainly put forward a claim forsimultaneous admission to membership. This will be embarrassing, since theexisting Constitution does not give the Federation full self-government and was put through on the understanding that there should be no major constitutional changes for the first eight or ten years. On various occasions over a period of twenty years before the Central African Federation came into being, Sir GodfreyHuggins, as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, attended by invitation meetingsof Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Originally he was invited as an observer when matters of special interest to Southern Rhodesia primarily economic matters were for discussion; but for many years past he has taken a,. full part in theproceedings even when these dealt with foreign affairs and defence. Last year Iwas assured by Sir Godfrey Huggins that no difficulty would arise in SouthernRhodesia in his continuing to attend such meetings as Prime Minister of theFederation. Nothing has been formally agreed about Sir Godfrey Huggins&apos; futureattendance; but it has been tacitly assumed, and I think accepted, that Sir Godfrey,or his successor, will be invited to attend in the future as in the past. If, in thecircumstances referred to above, the Federation does put forward a claim toadmission to membership along with the Gold Coast, my colleagues and I considerthat it will be impossible to refuse the practical substance of this claim, and atleast to concede that the Federal Prime Minister should thereafter attend meetingsof Commonwealth Prime Ministers as a matter of right, instead of, as hitherto, byinvitation. It may at the same time be necessary to provide for some increaseddevaluation of, external Affairs. Neither of these concessions would involve changesin the Constitution, and, as regards the first, we should in effect be validating theillogical position which has worked very well for some twenty years.7. If my colleagues endorse our recommendation no public statement willbe necessary, as we shall be following the course which is generally accepted asthe normal evolution. Nor would it be appropriate immediately to raise thequestion formally with the Governments of other member countries. TheGovernments of the &quot;old&quot; Commonwealth countries will, however, need to bebrought gradually face to face with the problem and given,ample time to reflectupon it, before the application of the Gold Coast for membership faces them
with the need for decision. If there is a Prime Ministers&apos; Conference in 1955, thewhole question can be discussed informally with the &quot; old&quot; commonwealth prime Ministers outside the Conference.8. We feel reasonably confident that Canada, Australia and New Zealandwill be ready to follow our lead, provided that the reasons for it are explained to them with care, and they are not required to take major decisions without duetime for reflection. India, Pakistan and Ceylon will welcome a proposal to extendfull membership to the Gold Coast. South Africa&apos;s likely attitude presents a muchmore difficult question, and the line she decides to take on the admission of theGold Coast to full membership may be of crucial importance.to.the future of theCommonwealth.. We may be faced with a choice between South Africa and theGold Coast. Dr. Malan, though he has made a number of bitter public attacks on the idea of the advance of the Gold Coast to membership, has been careful not to commit himself as to the decision the Union will make when faced with thequestion. There are many advantages to the Union in remaining within theCommonwealth, which Dr. Malan well recognises. But he will not go on for everand there are more extreme elements in the Nationalist Party who might forelectoral reasons be tempted to use the admission of the Gold Coast as a pretext for secession; on the other hand there are responsible elements in the nationalist party and if, as now seems likely, Mr. Havenga were to succeed Dr. Malan, theposition would be much easier. On the whole, our guess would be that, thoughthe Union Government may be expected to record dissent and make a protest,they will not leave the Commonwealth but accept a fait accompli.9. The date when the Gold Coasfs application for membership will come up is still uncertain, but it will certainly be within three years from now and possiblybefore the end of 1956. My colleagues may wish to know that measures are already being put in hand for introducing Gold Coast Ministers to international problems and for training of Gold Coast officials in the handling of them. For this purposean officer from the Commonwealth Relations Office will soon be attached to thestaff of the Governor and arrangements are being examined for the attachmentof Gold Coast officers to certain United Kingdom High Commissioners&apos; Offices(and possibly Foreign Office posts) for training purposes. y X10. My colleagues will remember the proposals of the Gqjd Coast, and also of Malta, last year to secure transfer from the Colonial Office to/the Commonwealth.Relations Office which we rejected (C.C. (53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3). TheCommonwealth Membership Committee recommend that it should be decidednow that no further territories should be transferred to the commonwealth relations Office before they are fully self-governing.11.   We invite our colleagues to agree (i) that there is no practicable alternative to a policy of endorsing the claims for admission to full membership of the Commonwealth, which may beexpected from certain Colonial territories when we give them full. self-government;(ii) that this will involve the admission of the Prime Minister of the central african Federation to Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings as of right, andpossibly other changes to accord to the Federation (within the limitsset by its constitution) the practical substance of full commonwealth membership;(iii) that the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica should be informally acquainted, as opportunity offers and inadvance of a formal decision being required in a specific case, with thenature of the problem and of our Views upon it;(iv) that responsibility for relations with territories should not be transferredto the Commonwealth Relations Office before they are fullyself-governing.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1;30th September, 1954: \46926b 2
appendix the FUTURE OF COMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPReport by the Official Committee1. Within the next few years the Gold Coast will insist On assuming full responsibility for her own affairs. She will probably wish to acquire the status of &quot; independence within the Commonwealth &quot; and will expect this to carry with it acceptance as a full member of the Commonwealth. She can only be admitted to full membership by a collective decision of the existing members. If she isnot so admitted, she will ask what her new constitutional status will be. the answer given to that question will have an important influence on the future pattern of the Commonwealth connection. It ought therefore to be given, not solely withreference to the Gold Coast, but in the knowledge that it will establish a precedentapplicable to other dependent territories which in future attain the status of&quot; independence within the Commonwealth.&quot;Before we reach this important turning-point in the evolution of theCommonwealth connection we should look ahead and consider in what general direction these constitutional developments should be guided. For this purposewe must try to forecast what the shape of the Commonwealth is likely to be in tenor twenty years&apos; time, and what will then be the essential links between itsindependent members.2. For many years past all political Parties in this country have supporteda Colonial policy of assisting dependent peoples to reach a stage of development at which they can assume responsibility for managing their own affairs. As a result,constitutional development is proceeding steadily in many parts of the colonial empire. This process cannot now be halted or reversed, and it is only to a limited extent that its pace can be controlled by the United Kingdom Government.Sometimes it may be possible to secure acceptance of a reasonable and beneficialdelay in order to ensure a more orderly transition. But, in the main, the pace of constitutional change will be determined by the strength of nationalist feeling andthe development of political consciousness within the territory concerned. political leaders who have obtained assurances of independence for their people normallyexpect that the promised independence will be attained within their own politicallifetime; and, if they cannot satisfy their followers that satisfactory progress isbeing maintained towards that goal, their influence may be usurped by lessresponsible elements. No Party in this country can afford to have it said that,though it promised independence, it never meant to concede it. Any attempt toretard by artificial delays the progress of Colonial peoples towards independence would produce disastrous results. Among other consequences it would ensure that,when power had eventually to be transferred, it would be handed over to a localleadership predisposed towards an anti-British policy.3. We therefore assume that constitutional development in the colonial empire will be allowed to pursue its natural course. If so, it seems likely that overthe next ten or twenty years it will produce something like the following pattern:  (a) Before the end of that time the following territories will have achieved a fully independent status and become candidates for full Common-wealth membership:  Gold Coast.Nigeria.Central African Federation.A Malayan Federation (including the present Federation of malaya, Singapore and possibly North Borneo, Sarawak andBrunei).A West Indian Federation.
(b) There will be a number of small territories which, though they may be orbecome capable of managing their own internal affairs, are never likelyto achieve full independence and cannot aspire to the status of full commonwealth membership.  These are:  Gibraltar.Malta.Cyprus. -Bermuda.Bahamas.British Honduras j&quot; uilless included in West Indian Federation.Falkland Islands.Fiji.Western Pacific High Commission Territories.Zanzibar.Gambia.Somaliland.North Borneo 1Sarawak V unless included in Malayan Federation.Brunei JAden.Hong Kong.Mauritius.Seychelles.St. Helena.(c) There remains an intermediate group where the future course of political development is uncertain:  Kenya.Tanganyika.Uganda.Sierra Leone.This classification makes no distinction between Crown Colonies, protectorates and Trust Territories.4. Most of the territories in group (b) present no immediate problem. Formany of them direct or indirect rule on the Colonial pattern will continue to be appropriate for many years to come even though we may find it necessary toabandon the term &quot; Colonial,&quot; in deference to latter-day susceptibilities and mis-representation in the United Nations. For such of these territories as may develop a desire to change their constitutional relations with the United Kingdom, it maybe useful to evolve a system by which they would pass under the jurisdiction of the privy Council and acquire a status comparable to that of the Channel islands and. the Isle of Man. Malta was recently offered such a status, with the approvalof the Cabinet, but has not yet accepted it. It would also be applicable to a numberof the other territories in group (by-though it might not be appropriate in allcases that the Home Secretary should be designated as the United kingdom minister responsible for presenting their affairs to the Privy.Council. From none of the territories in this group could there be any legitimate claim to full politicalequality with the independent members of the Commonwealth.Of the territories in Group (c) Sierra Leone may in due course develop onthe same lines as the Gold Coast. So might Uganda. In the other East african territories, however, the problem is different. There the first need is to find some means of reconciling the interests of the white settlers, the Asian community andthe indigenous African population. If this problem can be solved, it may bepossible to overcome the local objections, now strongly held, to the creation of an east African Federation which would in due course become a candidate for full commonwealth membership. -5. The urgent problem arises from the rapid growth of nationalism and the consequent pace of political development in the territories listed in group (a). Itis this which will test the flexibility of the Commonwealth Connection and will present an immediate challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship.
All the territories in this group are likely to attain full independence withinthe next 10 or 20 years. If they are then retained within the Commonwealth, theindependent countries of the Commonwealth will be: -United Kingdom        ...      ...Canada  ...      ...Australia ...      ...      ...      ...New Zealand   ...      .........South Africa    ...      ..........India     ............Pakistan ...      ............Ceylon......Central African Federation   ......West Indies Federation        ......Malayan Federation     .........Gold   Coast   (including  Ashanti   and territories) ...      .........Nigeria   ...      ............II6. What purposes will be served if all the countries in this group are heldtogether in the political association of the Commonwealth? What advantages shallwe gain?(i) We shall support and strengthen the political influence of the UnitedKingdom throughout the world.In former days the influence exercised by our small country of fifty million people was greatly enhanced by our possession of overseasdependencies in every part of the world. With the progressive realisation of our Colonial policy, we cannot hope to maintain that influence unless we succeed in holding together in a new form of association those partsof our former Empire which achieve independence. To follow courses which encouraged those countries to secede from the Commonwealth onattaining their independence would be tantamount to adopting a policyof deliberately weakening our own strength and authority in worldcouncils by a series of self-inflicted wounds. If we are to maintain our influence as a world power we must increasingly rely on our position asprimus inter pares in a group of independent Commonwealth countries.Our prestige and international standing has in fact been enhanced inrecent years by our capacity to hold within the Commonwealth countries to which we have accorded full political independence.(ii) We shall strengthen the economic position of the United Kingdom by adding political cohesion to the sterling area.(iii) We shall maintain such benefits to Commonwealth trade as can still besecured through the system of Imperial Preference.(iv) We shall strengthen our defence potential.We can no longer sustain unaided the defence commitmentsinvolved by the position which we wish to maintain as a world power.We cannot attain our defence objectives except as leaders of all theCommonwealth countries, independent and dependent. There are greatUncertainties in this. Thus, we cannot count on having the support ofIndia&apos;s military man-power, as we could before 1947, though theprospect of securing that of Pakistan is perhaps more promising. But wecan hope that by wise political leadership we may be able to mobilise aConsiderable part of the Commonwealth^ military resources in supportof some causes, at any rate. And, although we may not always succeed,it is clear that we must always try. Some of the younger Common-wealth members may become more willing to support a common military effort as the years go by. Meanwhile, the political connection betweenthe&quot; independent countries of the Commonwealth gives us valuablea Europeans: 2-6 millions., b Europeans: 213,000. ,&apos;.-.):;.-.-&apos;c Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados,&apos;and Leeward and Windward Islands.;    d Including Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei.Present Population(Milions)50-214-48-52-0...      12-6a...    356-975-8..8-16-262-7c7-ldsf.4-431-0
facilities in communications, raw materials and industrial potential, tosupport such Commonwealth forces as may be engaged in a future war.(v) Countries which maintain the British connection are less likely, in theperiod of their political immaturity, to pass under the influence of hostilePowers. Even though the grant of independence is delayed untilinternal political problems have been overcome, there is still a risk thatsome of the territories now nearing the stage of independence (e.g., aMalayan Federation) might, if they chose independence outside theCommonwealth, fall under the influence of a hostile Power-whetherby way of internal penetration or by open aggression. This risk willbe reduced if they remain within the political association of theCommonwealth.(vi) The Commonwealth is as yet the only effective international organisation which links together in an intimate association both European and non-European peoples. As such it now provides a valuable bridge betweenthe West and Asia, and in the coming generation it could do the samewith Africa. To play this role, the Commonwealth must retain itsmulti-racial character with equality between member nations ofdifferent races.(vii) From a broader point of view we may have faith that countries whichhave inherited, whether by blood or by upbringing, the British traditionsand outlook on life will be more likely to work for peace and to exercise a healthy influence in international affairs. They will be able to do somore effectively if they are linked together in a single politicalassociation.7. The independent Commonwealth peoples associated in this group arefavourably placed to exercise a substantial influence in world affairs.The group includes at least one country of outstanding importance and influence in each continent of the world Europe, (North) America, Africa, asia and the South Pacific.It embraces people of all the most important races save the Slavs and Mongols Europeans, Asians and Africans are included in it.It includes people of all the main religions of the world Christian, Moslem,Hindu and Buddhist.8. What is the essential link between them? What is the common feature ofthe group?The tie of blood, though important, is not an element common to all. It neverwas even in the halcyon days of Empire. The theory that the coherence of theold Dominions was founded on common ancestry from British stock ignored theethnological facts of French Canada and South Africa. Nearly one-third of thepopulation of Canada is of French origin and less than half is of British origin.In South Africa less than half of the European population is of British origin.Nor are we now all bound together by a common allegiance to the Crown, Allthe independent members of the Commonwealth recognise the Queen as Head ofthe Commonwealth and as the symbol of the free association of its peoples. Butthe Commonwealth of the future will probably include more than one republicwhose people owe no personal allegiance to the Sovereign. However greatly wemay regret this, it need not be fatal to the cohesion of the Commonwealth. Oneof the most obvious deductions from the common allegiance was the presumption that, if the United Kingdom were forced into war, all the other independent.Commonwealth countries would be at her side. But it has long been recognisedthat the decision to participate in a war rested with each Commonwealth Govern-ment separately.The cohesion of the Commonwealth will continue to be strengthened by thefact that many of its members owe allegiance to a. single Sovereign and that allrecognise that Sovereign as the symbol of their free association. / But the onefeature which will continue to be common to all Commonwealth members is thatthey were all at one time part of the British Empire and that they inherit, by birthor by upbringing, British traditions, methods of Government and Parliamentaryinstitutions. They have also inherited or acquired the use of the English languageas a medium (in most, places the medium) of: administration and civilised inter-course. Their common past makes it likely that there will be a broad similarityin their approach to major international problems. This is the important qualitywhich all the independent members of the Commonwealth have in common. \ Insome peoples who have recently achieved independence it may be obscured for a
time by the passing distempers which accompany emancipation from external rule,but when the initial exuberance of freedom has subsided it will emerge. to preserve, strengthen and develop it should be a prime object of Commonwealthpolicy. And the forms of the Commonwealth connection, and the procedures for maintaining it, should be so moulded and fashioned as to fulfil that policy..1 9. Many feared that the admission of three Asiatic countries to Common-wealth membership would impair the intimate relations which had previously been maintained between the independent members of the Commonwealth. And,although the older members have not allowed this widening of the Commonwealthcircle to disturb their old relations with one another, they have not as yet found it easy to treat the new Asiatic members on precisely the same footing. Thus, for various reasons, the United Kingdom Government has found it necessary todraw a distinction e.g., in the types of information communicated to other commonwealth Governments between the new and the old members of theCommonwealth.Fears are now entertained that the Commonwealth relationship may be furtherdiluted if the Gold Coast and other countries in a comparable stage of developmentachieve full membership. For this reason it has been suggested that the time hascome to develop a two-tier system of Commonwealth membership. Under thissystem membership of the inner circle, or upper tier, would be restricted to thosecountries which are in full control of their external relations and are capable ofmaking a significant contribution towards their own defence. The qualificationswould have to be so framed as to confine the inner membership to countries whose views would command respect in world councils. Thus, the test in respect of external relations would not be satisfied by a constitutional right to conductexternal relations or even perhaps by the fact that a country had entered intodiplomatic relations with neighbouring States or with a few of the Great Powers.A candidate for the upper tier would be required to show that it was effectivelyconducting its own foreign policy. As regards defence, it would not be possibleto make it a condition of inner membership that a country should be capable of defending itself, unaided, against external aggression. In the world of to-day thisambition is outside the reach of almost everybody. Most countries must rely, fortheir protection, on membership of some defensive alliance. The test would be whether the country had sufficient military strength to make it a worth-whilemember of such an alliance.10. This conception of a second class of Commonwealth membership hasattractions at first sight. But on closer examination it proves to be open to serious objections. And it seems doubtful whether it would be practicable to bring it into operation. Thus:  (i) The tests suggested for membership of the upper tier are not absolute:: they are essentially matters for judgment. The judgment on a particularapplication would have to be made by the existing members of the&apos; upper tier.  Would they find it easy to reach a decision acceptable toall? And would the applicant be content to accept an adverse decision?(ii) Not: all the countries now represented at meetings of commonwealth prime Ministers would qualify for membership of the inner circle on thebasis suggested. It is arguable that Ceylon might fail to pass the tests.The Central African Federation would certainly fail to qualify.   but its leading member, Southern Rhodesia, has for some time past enjoyed&quot;&apos;: de facto most of the benefits of full membership, including attendance at most meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers; and Sir GodfreyHuggins has been given to understand that he will enjoy, as Prime&apos;      Minister of the new Federation, the same advantages in this respect ashe formerly had as Prime Minister Of Southern Rhodesia. Would it be1! \ practicable to ask the Central African Federation-still less Ceylon towithdraw from the inner circle and accept a position in the second tier ?! : (iii) Some at any rate of the hew candidates for Commonwealth membership would be reluctant to accept the inferior status of second-tier member-ship especially if the Central African Federation remained in the upper&quot;:l&quot;&apos;Li   - tier.   Gold Coast Ministers have shown that they understand the distinction between the grant of self-government and the attainment of commonwealth membership.   But that does not lessen the risk that
the Gold Coast, on attaining full self-government, would reject any suggestions that it should remain within the Commonwealth with any constitutional status inferior to that of the older members,(iv) At the outset the lower tier would consist wholly of countries with colouredpopulations (unless the Central African Federation, with its Europeanelement, were constrained to join it). Even though India and Pakistanremained in the upper tier, it would be difficult to avoid creating theimpression that the second tier had been invented in order to prevent any further countries with coloured populations from entering the innercircle. It would be impossible to maintain the two-tier system if itcould be represented as based on a colour distinction.(v) Even if the newcomers could be induced to accept a lower-tier status, theywould probably be discontented with it and there is a risk that theirdiscontent would be exploited by India, who has already showndangerous tendecies to foster African nationalism. India, it is true,will be tempted to seek the leadership of the free African countries ifthey are admitted to full membership; but the risks involved in thiswould be less than those which would spring from India&apos;s championingtheir claim to elevation from a lower status.(vi) Unless we can retain the friendship and partnership of those colonial territories which are approaching self-government, it is likely that,instead of being at best co-operative or at least acquiescent, they may become positively hostile and, on the worst prospect, fall into the Sovietcamp. However uncomfortable it may be to have them as full membersof the Commonwealth, it would be far more damaging to our widerinterests if they were to turn against us. One of the great difficultiesin the two-tier suggestion is that aspirants to Commonwealth member-ship are likely to regard it as failing to meet their legitimate demands,and will therefore be disposed to secede from the Commonwealth ratherthan accept an inferior status within it. If the break were to occur withacrimony, the consequences might be very serious.(vii) Should any of these countries succeed in becoming members of the united nations* (as they almost certainly would if Russia changed her present attitude), they would hardly be content with an inferior status withinthe Commonwealth when, at the same time, they would sit in theGeneral Assembly on equal terms, not only with other commonwealth countries who are members of the United Nations, but with the UnitedStates, Russia and other great Powers.11. Apart from these practical difficulties, the two-tier system will defeat theessential purpose of the Commonwealth connection if, as stated in paragraph 8above, that purpose is to develop a community of outlook among all Common-wealth members on the main international problems of the day.The countries which will shortly assume full responsibility for their own affairs will in fact wish to conduct from the outset some of their external relations. Thus,the Gold Coast will undoubtedly wish to develop diplomatic relations with theUnited States, with Liberia and probably with the other European countries havingColonial possessions in Africa. A Malayan Federation would certainly wish tomaintain diplomatic relations with Indonesia and, in less troubled times, with china. A West Indian Federation would probably wish to establish relations withthe United States.As soon as any of these countries begin to conduct any external relations,they will feel the need of friendly help and advice. It is important that they shouldbe encouraged to look for this to ourselves and to other members of theCommonwealth. The concept outlined in paragraph 8 above will be whollydestroyed unless they do. The last thing we would wish is that any of thesecountries should be drawn into some foreign sphere of influence. It would, forexample, be highly embarrassing if any of them, on gaining admission to the united nations, were drawn into a South American bloc or an Arab bloc likely on occasion to vote against the other members of the Commonwealth. This situation would be only too Ukely to arise if, through being relegated to. a second tier ofCommonweatlh membership, they were excluded and felt themselves to be excluded from the intimate interchange of views and information on foreignpolicy which characterises the relations between the existing members of theCommonwealth.;* See C.C.M. (54) 2.46926 G
12. In practice, the only means of ensuring that these countries, on attainingindependence, will turn to us for help and advice in the conduct of their external relations is to make available to them from the outset information and guidance on such international questions as are of direct concern to them. Their first steps in the conduct of external relations will be of crucial importance. It will thereforebe most desirable that they should have from the outset the guidance of british officials experienced in Commonwealth relations and in international affairs.This means that a United Kingdom High Commissioner, with suitable staff, shouldbe stationed in these countries from the moment they attain independence indeed, there would be great advantage in having representation of this character at some earlier stage and that they should themselves establishas soon as possible thereafter corresponding missions in London and, later,in other Commonwealth capitals. These High Commissioners will not beable to carry out their task unless they are provided from London with aflow of information and guidance, selective at first but progressively enlarged,on international matters of common concern to the Commonwealth as a whole.And, as time goes on, there will be need for personal exchanges between the foreign ministers of those countries and of the older members of the Commonwealth.It is only by this means that we can hope to develop, in new Commonwealthmembers, that similarity of approach to the main problems of international relations which enables the Commonwealth to exercise its influence in world affairs. but these procedures, viz., the exchange of High Commissioners, the interchange ofinformation and views on foreign policy, and attendance at periodical meetingsof Commonwealth Ministers, are in fact the outward marks of full commonwealth membership.All this suggests that the essential purpose of the Commonwealth connectionwill not be achieved unless countries attaining full independence within it are admitted to full membership of it. This need not mean that certain aspects of the irrelations with/the United Kingdom or other Commonwealth members could notbe defined and regulated by written agreements importing specified duties and obligations. There would certainly be scope for such agreements on defence,finance and other matters: agreements of this kind were in fact concluded withCeylon.IV13. One of the objections sometimes raised to any further extension of full commonwealth membership is that what was formerly a close partnership between a few influential countries will be impaired if membership is opened to a largenumber of small countries. It is feared that the few Commonwealth countrieswhich carry weight in the world would fail to make their views prevail at a meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers if they were outnumbered by countries newlyadmitted to independence and still insignificant internationally.This apprehension, if it is seriously entertained, may be allayed by knowledge that, of the countries likely soon to claim full membership, so many will come forward in groups, viz., the Central African Federation, the Malayan federation and the West Indian Federation. It will be seen from the population figures,which have been given for this reason in paragraph 5 above, that the newcomersat such a gathering will not in fact be representing small territories or insignificantinterests.A more compelling consideration is, however, that on these occasions decisionsdo not go by vote. Nor, for that matter, does influence depend on card votes.At these meetings leadership and influence will doubtless continue to be exercised by those who can command it, on their individual merits or by virtue of the actual or potential power of the countries which they represent.14. At &quot; plenary &quot;meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers-all membersof the Commonwealth would need to be represented. But this need not make itimpossible to hold from time to time smaller meetings at which something lessthan the whole body of Commonwealth members would be represented. Meetingsto deal with specific regional problems could probably be arranged. And smallermeetings could sometimes be held on a functional basis, e.g., some defencediscussions could be limited to countries which had accepted specific defence commitments.: It might even be possible to develop a system by which formal meetings, onthe model of the old Imperial Conferences, were held for the discussion of financialand economic questions and other technical matters-the Colonies, as well as independent Commonwealth countries, being represented on such occasions but
the smaller meetings of Prime Ministers were treated as more informal gatheringsto be held at irregular intervals, as occasion offered. This might make it possiblefor the Prime Ministers of some of the older Commonwealth countries to meet together from time to time, even though not all of the new member countries were represented.It must, however, be admitted that in arranging meetings confined mainly tothe Prime Ministers of the old Commonwealth countries great care would haveto be taken to avoid importing the suggestion that a concealed two-tier system was in operation. It is also true that such smaller meetings, whether convenedon a regional or on a functional basis, would rarely consist of those Prime ministers and no other. Thus, in recent consultations between commonwealth representatives in New York to deal with United Nations business, it has usuallybeen found desirable to include India and sometimes there has been no need toinclude South Africa.15. The admission of further countries to Commonwealth membership may also lead to some changes in the procedures for day-to-day exchanges between commonwealth Governments. The free and full exchange of information andviews which takes place between, say, the United Kingdom and Canada will be neither necessary nor appropriate in the case of an African territory which hasnewly attained its independence. It will be reasonable that there should be somediscrimination, between one Commonwealth Government and another, in providinginformation and guidance on international questions of current interest. This,however, will not involve any radical departure from existing practice. The timewhen a Dominions Secretary sought to take into account what was regarded as a collective point of view of &quot; the Dominions&quot; has long since passed: theindependence of the other Commonwealth members has now advanced to a point at which they have to be treated as individual nations, not as indistinguishablemembers of a homogeneous group. In the day-to-day exchanges, as in matters of constitutional status, there would be dangers in discriminating by class and developing hard-and-fast differentiations in treatment between &quot; old &quot; members and &quot;new&quot; or, for that matter, between &quot;old,&quot; Asian and African members.The safer and better course will be to develop still further the existing practice of treating each particular country on its individual merits and sending to each such information as it is thought to require. If this sort of discrimination is known tobe applied as between, say, Canada and Australia, it will be more easily defendedas between, say, Ceylon and the Gold Coast.16. Africa&apos;s future presents a challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship.The forthcoming application of the Gold Coast for full Commonwealth membershipwill mark a decisive turning-point in the evolution of the commonwealth connection. It will be recognised as such by all the other members of theCommonwealth, and especially by the Asian members. The solution suggested inthis paper will certainly produce difficulties. In South Africa &quot; Gold Coastpolicies &quot; is already a term of opprobrium used to describe the bringing of african colonies to independence at too fast a pace, or indeed bringing them to independenceat all. Racial equality has no appeal for the vast majority of the inhabitants of theUnion, whether Afrikaans or English-speaking. It is questionable whetherDr. Malan (who, like all other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, would have to be consulted before a collective decision was taken on the admission of a new member)would agree to the Gold Coasfs admission to Commonwealth membership. It is not impossible that a decision to admit the Gold Coast might lead him to dissociateSouth Africa from the Commonwealth. On the other hand a decision to refuseher admission might lead Mr. Nehru to take a similar course and would certainlyproduce a wide rift between the old members of the Commonwealth and the Asianmembers. A decision based, or thought to be based, on a denial of racial equalitymight well lead to a disruption of the Commonwealth as we know it to-day. If it did not lead to the secession of the Asian countries from the Commonwealth itmight provoke them into assuming an open leadership of all the aspiring african colonies which might be even more disruptive in its effects on the cohesion of theCommonwealth and Empire.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK(On behalf of the Committee).&apos;     Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st January, 1954.
