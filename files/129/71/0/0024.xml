S5?Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1954SECRET Copy No.    6 8C. (54) 32426th October, 1954CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE: STRATEGIC CONTROLS ON SHIPPINGMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theFirst Lord of the AdmiraltyA rather awkward situation has arisen on East/West strategic controls on shipping.2. Briefly, the objectives which we in the United Kingdom have in mindare first, to try to stop the sale of fast merchantmen to Russia on the grounds that they might be used as commerce raiders; and secondly, to ensure that ourshipyards, in which the order books are shortening, should have access to theRussian market for &quot; safe &quot; ships in order to maintain employment and a highstate of activity in this important industry.3. In essence the existing controls are as follows. Some ships are bannedaltogether like warships, tankers and large ice breakers. The remainder, though not banned, are under a system whereby each country has to consult theCo-ordinating Committee in Paris in advance before accepting an order for anyship which is over 7,000 tons or can do more than 12 knots. In the last resort,however, the decision is with the individual country concerned.4. In addition to the ships altogether banned under existing controls,agreement has been reached in Paris to ban other types of particular strategicvalue, such as those which might easily be used as troopers, vehicle carriers or aircraft carriers. This agreement may be regarded by some countries as conditional upon a comprehensive agreement covering the outstanding problems referred tobelow.5. Obviously the present machinery is not very satisfactory. We in theUnited Kingdom have preferred on strategic grounds not to sell any ships above15 knots. The Naval Staff attach particular importance to limiting speed so faras possible. On the other hand, the Dutch are building five, which can do15^ knots. The Danes are selling one over 15 knots and are insisting on theright to sell ships faster than even 15J knots. The danger is that under thissystem, in order to get orders, other countries besides Denmark may be tempted to go further and further into higher speed ranges. Our ship-builders would be increasingly at a disadvantage if we for our part maintain our present policy asregards speed.6. We and the Americans have been anxious to secure control over thesefaster ships. The Consultative Group in Paris, after long and difficult negotiations in which the Danes have been particularly stubborn in the matter of speed, has put the following proposal to Governments:  (1) Ships over 15J knots should be banned for everybody except the Daneswho should be allowed to sell up to 15,000 tons, which probably meansabout two of these ships, a year.x    (2) For ships of 15^ knots or less, there should be a global quota, for all the paris countries, of 600,000 tons over three years.   But individual47040
, countries instead of being free to compete for orders within this globalquota, would be limited to national quotas of 105,000 tons each.!-,,    (3) Countries which have already committed themselves (before 8th September,1954) to trade agreements to supply ships to the Soviet bloc, mayexceed the global quota in order to fulfil their commitments; this inpractice applies only to Holland.7. The Americans have all along considered that a limit should be put onthe quantity of shipping exported to the Soviet bloc. We do not feel that such a limit is justified, but the Cabinet at their meeting on 24th February were prepared,in order to get an agreement, to compromise by accepting an annual global quota of 150;000 to 200,000 tons per year (C.C. (54) 11th Conclusions, Minute 7).8. We are being pressed by Mr. Stassen to accept the plan in paragraph 6.We must tell our colleagues frankly that we do not want to accept it; we do not atall fancy the task of trying to defend it in the House of Commons. The Danishexception was offered by the Americans to the Danes against our wishes andprobably cannot be withdrawn. It is hard enough to have to admit from time totime that other countries are selling goods that we are not. But to defend anagreement under which we have expressly agreed that they should be allowed todo so is still harder.9. Moreover to limit the United Kingdom to the same quota as all thesmaller ship-producers of Europe makes the situation worse &quot;still. This limitation,within the global quota, has nothing to do with security, although the Americansthink it may in practice tend to keep orders below the global limit. It doeshowever appeal to more than one other country because it will ensure that theUnited Kingdom shipbuilders cannot in any circumstances get as big a share ofthe Russian market as they would be able to do on the basis of their competitive,efficiency. This is a gross misuse of strategic controls.10. Then there is the special arrangement for the Dutch. It gives a specialadvantage to a country which has entered into a trade agreement with.Russia.We shall be immediately asked why we did not do so.11. We have got to judge this kind of agreement in the round. In the last resort it may be possible to defend one or other of these awkward clauses. Butthe combination of them altogether seems to us to add up to a proposal whichit just is not worth our while to support, and our advice would be to have nothing to do with it. From soundings which have been taken it seems clear that the shipbuilding industry would be very critical of any arrangement which puts them at a disadvantage as compared with foreign competitors.12. At the same time we recognise that if we do not accept this offer, whichis acceptable to all the other countries and to the United States we may not get anagreement at all. We shall then have to rely on such pressure as we and theUnited States can bring to bear to prevent other countries selling dangerous ships to Russia. This pressure is not insignificant. Nevertheless, without an agreement,it is possible that more fast ships will be sold than the Consultative Group&apos;sproposals would allow to the Danes.13. In our view there is only one sane way of running strategic controls, toagree upon what is really dangerous and stop it, and then to allow free trading in everything which is outside that short restricted list. This is the main themeof policy that we have been following over the past year. We are sure it is right and every time we are forced to abandon it at all we get into trouble. The currentproposal is doubly offensive: it would not stop the export of dangerous ships from Denmark; but it would make it impossible for the United Kingdom to do a fair trade in other ships.14. We would like to be authorised to tell the Americans and others thatthe United Kingdom are not prepared to lend their support to an agreement onthe lines proposed, although we should be anxious to keep the ban on the additionaltypes referred to in paragraph 4.15. The only alternative which we can see to this course would be a further approach to the Americans in the hope of securing a compromise which has alreadybeen discussed with Mr. Stassen, who expressed strong preference for the course
described in paragraph 6. Under this compromise the Danes would be allowedtheir two ships of over 15  knots a year, but other countries would remain free tosell ships below this speed on the basis of entering into contracts at will and reporting them afterwards for discussion by the Co-ordinating Committee. Wehave pointed out the powerful objections to this concession to Denmark; inparticular it would arouse the strongest feelings on the part of British shipbuilders.Nevertheless if the Cabinet consider this course to be preferred, we are wuling to try to achieve such a compromise with the Americans, provided that itsobjectionable features are fully appreciated..&apos;:.&apos;;;:v\ &apos; . , &apos;. ;/&quot;; p.. t. v. *: .:;j. p.l.t.26th October, 1954.
