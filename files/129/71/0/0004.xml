confidential.(54) 304 COPY NO.2nd October, 1954CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF GATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation the Home Affairs Committee to-day instructed me to refer backto the Cabinet for decision the issues of -(i) the diversion of the Brighton Road, and(ii)  compensation to householders living near the developed airport.2,        On the road diversion the facts have been set out by the Committeeof officials which, in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 8th September(C. C. (54) 59th Conclusions, Minute 6) examined outstanding aspects of theGatwick project.    I attach at Appendix A the relevant extract from theirreport.3.        I agree with the opinion therein expressed (paragraph 17) that scheme (c) offers the best solution but would cost  1.45 millions more thanthe   369,000 which is the estimated cost of scheme (a) - the original proposal as put forward by my predecessor.    Scheme (c) involvesconstructing a section of the projected Brighton Radial Road and Eastbournespur;  scheme (a) involves a short diversion of the road round the easternboundary of the aerodrome.4.        The real difficulty about scheme (c) is that there is no road fundmoney available within the next few years to meet expenditure of this order in addition to the schemes announced by my predecessor.    From aroads point of view the Brighton Radial Road has low priority comparedwith other proposals, and, further, even if it were treated as a specialadditional item, building this road out of money provided for roads inadvance of many much more urgent projects would arouse severe criticism,particularly from areas whose projects have not been accepted.5.        Consequently, if we are to find money for scheme (c), it wouldbe easier to meet criticisms if provision were to be made on my CivilAviation Vote.    The difficulty here is that this would increase the costof the Gatwick project by  1.45 millions over the  6 millions estimatedcost for stage 1, and the  10 millions for stages 1 and 2 together.6.        The Gatwick project has been considered both by the cabinet and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the basis of the figures setout in the preceding paragraph, and I do not feel it would be proper forme now to press for a financial alteration of this magnitude.
7.        The argument on the other side is that acceptance of scheme (c)would ease the position locally and that all the expenditure involved isexpenditure which will ultimately be needed.8.        The case for compensation rests on the argument that state -ments made on behalf of the late Government amounted to a pledge not todevelop Gatwick and that those people who acted on that pledge are inpresent circumstances entitled to compensation, though this would not normally be given to property owners near airports.    I attach as appendix B the text of these statements.9.        On compensation, though the matter is evenly balanced, I favour the scheme outlined in paragraph 10 of my C. (54) 282.    I appreciate,however, the difficulty of preventing repercussions from payments ofcompensation in such a case, and as a second best I would be preparedto make it known that my Department will be ready to purchase certainproperties adjoining the airport boundaries, if their owners desire tosell in order to leave the area.    Some accommodation will be needed for the staff of my Department and I am in touch with the Treasuryabout this.    I am also told by British European Airways that they will need for their employees plenty of living and working accommodationclose to Gatwick.10.       The Cabinefs decision is, therefore, requested -(a) whether the road diversion should be treated asin scheme (a) or scheme (c);(b) whether a limited scheme of compensation is tobe applied to owners of adjoining properties,or whether an attempt should be made to,alleviate hardship by purchases.For reasons which I would be glad to develop orally, it would be very helpful if an early statement could be made.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.1st October, 1954.-2-
13DIVERSION OF THE LONDON-BRIGHTON ROAD (A.23)15.      There are three proposals to be considered:-(a)   The proposal put to the Public Enquiry by the ministry for a short diversion of A. 23 round the eastern boundary of the aerodrome, costing  369,000.(b) The proposal by the Surrey County Council and others thata section of the Brighton Radial Road should be builtwith links joining it to A. 23 north and south of the aerodrome, the road at (a) being reduced to the status of a simple access road to the aerodrome.    The net cost of this would be  881,000.(c) A counter-proposal strongly supported by the Ministryof Housing and Local Government for the constructionof a larger section of the Brighton Radial Road and iheEastbourne spur, which together with the access roadwould cost  1,819,999.16.      Everyone is agreed that scheme (b) is unsatisfactory on the viewthat it would be an intrinsically bad piece of roadmaking and not worth the expenditure involved.    Proposal (a) is unsatisfactory as a permanentdiversion of A. 23.    It will involve towing aircraft for two or three yearsacross this heavily trafficked road, will leave the Surrey County Councilgravely dissatisfied and will involve expenditure which will be renderedabortive when the Radial Road comes to be built.17.      Scheme (c) is clearly overall the best solution.    It provides a new and improved main road where one will eventually be necessaryanyway, and it saves  212,000 of expenditure on the road round the airport which, under scheme (a), would have to be wider than will benecessary when the Brighton Radial Road is complete.18.       The only objection to scheme (c) is that the road programme,within the limits now prescribed for it, is too fully committed for thenext three years on schemes already announced; and the Governmentwould lay themselves open to criticism from areas such as the north-east where claims are technically stronger and who might think thattheir claims were prejudiced by a scheme which on road policy alone would not in the ordinary course have been put into execution for aconsiderable time.19.       On the other hand it can be argued that the construction ofGatwick Airport involving as it does the cutting of the existing A. 23,should advance the priority of these 10 miles of the new BrightonRadial Road and the cost should be faced as road expenditureinevitably caused by, although not necessarily part of, the Gatwickscheme.
APPENDIX BLIST OF STATEMENTS ABOUT GATWICKNovember, 1946. At the Public Enquiry into the Crawley NewTown, the Inspector intervened with Ministry of Civil Aviation approvalas follows:-&quot;I may remark here that Gatwick is no longer to be a majorairport and the Ministry of Civil Aviation have no objectionto the siting of the New Town, &quot;8th January, 1947, in the letter of decision on the Crawley NewTown Planning Enquiry, the Ministry of Town and Country Planningincluded the following reference to Gatwick:-&quot;The existence of Gatwick Airfield so near to the site of theNew Town was represented as a bad feature.    This matter was carefully considered when selecting the area for the NewTown development.    The future use of Gatwick as an airfieldis as yet undecided but, in the event of its continuation, it islikely to be used mainly as a base for charter and privateflying.    The Minister considers that the proximity of this type of airfield to the New Town, far from being a detriment,will have definite advantages. &quot;1st March, 1949, Hansard, Column 213, extract from a statement by Mr. Lindgren, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of CivilAviation:-&quot;I turn now to Gatwick, Blackbushe and Bovingdon.Bovingdon and Blackbushe are both reouisitioned aerodromes and it is not the intention of my Ministry to acquire either ofthem.    Gatwick is being derequisitioned in September ofthis year. &quot;30th July, 1952, Hansard, Column SdsL.    Written reply to a parliamentary Question - Mr. Lennox-Boyd:--&quot;It has now been decided to develop Gatwick as the southernalternative to London Airport and as a base for somescheduled services and other air transport activities.The detailed plans for the development of the airport willbe discussed with the Local Authorities in the near future.This should be regarded as part of the development ofairport facilities in the London Area. &quot;5th November, 1953, extract from Public Meeting at Gatwick.Mr. Lennox-Boyd in reply to questions:-&quot;&quot;Clearly I could not give a sort of blanket promise that ifpeople find life intolerable, the Government of the day would buy their house.....I would certainly look at caseswhere, just because a house or property happened to be just a few yards outside the perimeter of the aerodrome
and, therefore, was not subject to compulsory purchase ....I would look at every individual case ... I will give you thatpromise. &quot;   In reply to a further question - &quot;I am preparedto listen carefully and sympathetically to cases whereproperty is so near an aerodrome as to be to all intentsand purposes part of it, although not in fact part of it. &quot;It is logical to point out in this context that as early as 1950 the plans for intensive flying at Stansted became seriously prejudiced by thegrowth of military flying in East Anglia.    A review of the problem ledto this statement by Mr. Beswick, the then Parliamentary Secretary,in the House of Commons onJ^ J^ ^uty* 1950:-&quot;Representations have recently been made by british european Airways to my Department that Gatwick shouldbe developed as a regular terminal for certain of their services.    These representations are at present underconsideration. &quot;
