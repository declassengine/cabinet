SECRETCa(54) 337  - COPY NO.8th November, 1954CABINETTIME-TABLE FOR REVIEW OF WAR PENSIONS and national INSURANCE PENSIONS AND benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national InsuranceGeneralThe National Insurance Scheme, which is the main subject of the review, is exceedingly complicated.    It is due for review under legislation passed in 1946 and lays down a statutory procedure which I am bound tofollow.    This includes the laying before Parliament of a report by theGovernment Actuary on the five years1 working of the Scheme, and a subsequent report by myself on the adequacy of existing rates of benefit and pensions.    The outcome of the review will have far-reachingconsequences on the future of the Scheme,  the main feature of whichis the rapidly mounting bill for pensions.    We are at present payingnearly  360 millions a year in pensions and in twenty-five years&apos; time we should, at existing rates, be paying about  665 millions.    It was because of the seriousness of this prospect that we appointed the expert committee tinder Sir Thomas Phillips to advise us on the steps we shouldtake to meet it.    We have more than once emphasised that we cannot actbefore we get their report;  if we now announce complete proposals forour review without waiting for the report, or before we are at leastable to say that we are cognisant of its contents, we shall lay ourselvesopen to very just criticism from informed opinion that we are sacrificingthe stability of the great National Insurance Scheme to public clamour.Importance of preserving the insurance principle2.        We collect over  500 millions in a year in contributions towardsthe cost of various social services.    If we are not careful we shalljeopardise all this.    To preserve the insurance character of theNational Insurance Scheme we must review rates of benefit and contribu-tions simultaneously and as far as possible bring the two sets of new rates into force at the same time.    The preparation, printing anddistribution of new stamps of over twenty different denominations  whichare needed to collect the new contributions is a long process which cannotbe materially accelerated by emergency measures and it would be quite impossible to have these stamps available in the first two or threemonths of the New Year.Administrative problems3.        I regard the safeguarding of the insurance principle as paramount.I must, however, also warn my colleagues that if we attempt to carry outthe.necessary work for an orderly up-rating of pensions in my offices
Doduring January, February or March we shall be heading for an almost certain breakdown owing to the burden which even normal winter sicknessamong the public imposes on my offices; we cannot, moreover, exclude the possibility of a winter epidemic when sickness payments impose avery serious burden indeed.   We should incur well-merited censure if,as the result of trying to bring new rates of benefit in a little earlier,we land pensioners and sick people in the hardship and inconveniencethey would inevitably suffer if they were left without the means ofobtaining payment of the pensions and benefits due to them.    alternative arrangements would be makeshift in character.    They would involve thePost Office and lead to long queues in the busier post offices,  touncertainties and disputes about whether old people had been paid the correct amount or not, and to the waste of a considerable amount ofpublic money owing to lack of reasonable financial safeguards.National Assistance4.        The National Assistance Board are in a somewhat similarposition as regards any increase in assistance scales.    The national assistance Act deliberately placed responsibility for proposing increases  &apos;in scales on the National Assistance Board.    If they were now, for thefirst time, to adopt some emergency plan of an obviously makeshiftcharacter for bringing new scales into force in the immediate future,it would be plain to everybody that the Board had moved in response toGovernment pressure or for other reasons.    This would undermine thewhole object of removing the administration of assistance from directMinisterial control.     The Chairman of the Board did, however, come tosee me some time ago and I have had a further talk with him as theresult of which I expect the Board will put forward proposals for raising the scales of assistance early in the New Year.    I hope now to receivethese proposals in time to announce them at the same time as I announcemy own plans.War Pensions5.        The time-table for increasing war pensions is more flexible.Since no question of insurance is involved it has always been regarded as.possible to pay the increased rate as from the date when the royal warrant takes effect.    In my time-table I have followed the usual practice of bringing war pensions increases into force before the others.I am providing a certain measure of priority for them, but we must be careful not to lay ourselves open to the criticism of favouring the wardisabled, unduly.Proposed programme.        The Appendix sets out a programme for bringing increased ratesof pensions and benefits into payment under a reasonably orderly arrange-ment.    It involves some risks but I think they are reasonable ones.    Thereally crucial point in all these plans is the signature of the report of thePhillips Committee.    We have attached so much importance to havingit that it is almost impossible now to make detailed announcements about our proposals for National Insurance pensions and benefits before it isat any rate signed.    If signature is delayed we may have to make aseparate announcement about war pensions and national assistance anddefer for a few days our announcement about National Insurance benefits and pensions.    Provided, however, the report is signed by about the
13 fmiddle of December at latest we should be able to adhere to the programme set out in the Appendix so far as payment of the various benefits areconcerned, but of course if we cannot take the Second Reading of theBill before Christmas the Parliamentary time-table when we re-assembleis likely to be difficult.I shall be prepared, if desired, to inform my colleagues of thenature of the increases which I propose in the main rates of pensions,benefits and contributions involved in the operation.    I have agreed thesewith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    While I would propose to submit a detailed paper on this subject in all its complexity later in the month, i see advantages in obtaining the reaction of my colleagues to the schemesI have in mind so that I may start preparing my plans in the knowledge that I have my colleagues&apos; support.    In view of the importance of secrecy, I would prefer at this stage not to circulate a detailed plan.O.P.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W. C. 2.8th November, 1954.
