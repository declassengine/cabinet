Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   *] 3C. (54) 34817th November, 1954CABINETCAPITAL EXPENDITURE ON HOSPITALSMemorandum by the Minister of health the Cabinet are to discuss housing investment and capital expenditure in education, and in such a review of social service policy will wish to have in mind the position of the Hospital Service.2. Recently published figures showing the capital expenditure by public authorities in Great Britain on different social services give this picture:  Increase1949-50       1952-53      or decrease(  Millions)    (  Millions)    (Per Cent.)Housing    .........    254-5 363-8 ^ A3Education.........      32 1 64 1 4-100Hospital Services......      12-8 12-5 -   2-3In terms of pre-war values, we are in fact now spending on capital account forour hospitals, less than one-third of the rate of capital expenditure on hospitalsbefore the war.3. I am, of course, aware that the method of financing hospital buildingdiffers from that of local authority building, but I do not feel that this shouldinfluence the allocation of a reasonable share of the available resources to thedifferent services.4. I do not think it wrong that capital investment in education, for example,has doubled in^he Table shown above, nor do I oppose the suggestion for further expenditure on it. But I cannot, at the same time, justify the position in regard tohospitals.5. Over 50 per cent, of our hospitals in England and Wales were built before1900. More than 300 of them are over 100 years old. Many are very uneconomicto run. There is hideous overcrowding still in the mental hospitals. In the new towns the provision of hospital and health services lags far behind that of anyother Department. The problems of the old make increasing demand on our resources, not only in the hospitals, but on the local health authorities.6. Not a single new permanent hospital has been built in England and Walessince before the war.7. My predecessor, the Lord Privy Seal, held down the rate of capital development in the Hospital Service in view of the extremely serious financialposition that we inherited. Year by year, I have pursued the same policy. when this year I felt that I could no longer continue at the previous levels, I put in tothe Treasury a claim for  16 millions for building work at National Health Servicehospitals for the financial year 1955-56. This would have permitted no more than47165
2half the building being done before the war. When the Swinton Committee wasappointed, I felt that I had to try and hold the position for a further year and offered to cut my bid from  16 millions back to  10 millions a reduction of37^ per cent.  This was accepted, and I do not seek to go back on the decision.8. I am putting in a bid for no more than  12 millions for building work at these hospitals in England and Wales for the year 1956-57 and for  17 millions for the year 1957-58. These are minimum figures, but I do not ask now for any decision in regard to them. My colleagues, however, should be aware that we areneglecting capital development in the hospital services and we are far more vulnerable to criticism here even than on education.I. M.Ministry of Health, W. 1,16th November, 1954.
