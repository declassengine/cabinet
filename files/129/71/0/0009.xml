Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954SECRET, Copy NO&apos;, g gC. (54) 30913th October, 1954CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILLConcession for people whose land is compuSsorily acquired where there ought tohave been a claim under the 1947 Act but hone was madeMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentMy colleagues all know about Mr. Pilgrim. In 1950 he bought half an acreof land for  400. That was much too high a price because of the effect of theTown and Country Planning Act, 1947. Had building been allowed a development charge was, at that time, payable; or had a public authority bought the land theywould have paid only its value for its existing use. Meanwhile no Claim on the 300 millions had been made for the land, and in 1950 it was too late for anyoneto make a claim. Mr. Pilgrim was therefore paying for development value, but hewas not getting it, nor any benefit in lieu. In 1953 the land was compulsorily acquired by the Romford Borough Council for housing purposes. Under theterms of the 1947 Act the Council could pay only  65, that being the existing use value.2. Mr. Pilgrim had borrowed the money to buy the land, and the losssustained seems to have so preyed upon his mind that he committed suicide.3. Had a claim been made under the 1947 Act it would have been admittedat  335, and Mr. Pilgrim, as he had apparently paid the full value to the previousowner, would have been paid that sum (plus interest) by the Central Land Boardwhen the current Bill becomes law. The Board would in due course have recoveredthe sum from Romford.4. Mr. Pilgrim suffered under the 1947 Act. But our difficulty in maintainingthis defence is that the current Bill does nothing to prevent equally hard casesarising in the future. The Bill does contain protection for people who buy land infuture; they can find out if compulsory acquisition is threatened, and if they are told it is not and, nevertheless, the land is compulsorily bought within 5 years oftheir inquiry, they will be paid, in effect, market value. But it does nothing for people who already own land on which there ought to have been a claim but nonewas made.5. If my colleagues feel that we must do something for future cases and weare certainly going to be pressed to do so in the House of Lords we could movean amendment to provide (putting it very briefly) that where land is boughtcompulsorily after the Bill becomes law, the Minister can, if he is satisfied thata claim would have been payable if made, and that it is reasonable in all thecircumstances that some additional payment should be made on this account, fix asupplement which the acquiring authority would then be required to pay on top of the existing use value. Where it is decided that a supplement ought to be paid the amount would be related, as nearly as practicable, to what would have been due on a claim; but there would be no provision for arbitration.If this is agreed, the Lord Chancellor would, presumably, indicate that a concession would be proposed when moving the Second Reading.46958
6. There was a good deal of pressure for some provision to meet &quot; no claim &quot;cases when the Bill was going through the Commons. I took the line that we muststick to the basis of admitted claims and that was accepted. But I think thatwe could include a discretionary power of the kind outlined without imperillingthe broad scheme. And it would enable us to meet the cases of greatest hardship.The supplement would be payable by the acquiring authorities. That would include Departments acquiring land under compulsory powers.8. The discretion would be limited to compulsory acquisition. It would notapply where a planning restriction was imposed where an owner is told that he cannot build on his land but must keep it as it is. I think that this distinction isdefensible.9. The concession would not apply to cases where the acquisition has takenplace before the new Bill becomes law-where land has been bought under the1947 Act for existing use value only and there ought to have been a claim but nonewas made. Therefore it would not have helped Mr. Pilgrim. But it would enable, theGovernment to say that they were ensuring that such cases could not occur infuture. A propos Mr. Pilgrim, however, the Romford Council have asked mewhether, if they now pay  300 to  400 to his widow, I will, as I have power to do,remove the expenditure from review by the District Auditor. It would be easier for me to agree to this if the Bill were to make such payments legal for futureacquisition.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,13th October, 1954.
