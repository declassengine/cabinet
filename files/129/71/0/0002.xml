SUMMARY OF A DISCUSSION AT 10 DOWNING STREET, on tuesday, SEPTEMBER 28, AT 11 15 p.m.The following were present: The Right Hon. Sir Winston Churchill (Prime Minister).The Right Hon. Anthony Eden (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).The Most Hon. The Marquess of Salisbury (Lord President).The Right Hon. Lord Simonds (Lord Chancellor).The Right Hon Sir David Maxwell Fyfe (Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs).The Right Hon. H. Crookshank (Lord Privy Seal).The Right Hon. Earl Alexander of Tunis (Minister of Defence).The Right Hon. Viscount Swinton (Secretary of State for commonwealth relations).The Right Hon. Harold Macmillan (Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment).Mr. J. R. Colville.The object of the meeting was to discuss the proposal in C. (54) 298 that theForeign Secretary should, at a crucial stage of the Nine-Power talks at presenttaking place, be empowered to give an undertaking (i) that the United Kingdom would maintain on the Continent the effectivestrength of the British Forces now assigned to the Supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR), i.e., four divisions, and the tactical air Force or whatever SACEUR regarded as their equivalent fightingcapacity;(ii) not to withdraw these forces against the wishes of the majority of the brussels Treaty Powers who should take their decision in knowledgeof SACEUR&apos;s views.This undertaking would be subject to revision in the event of an overseasemergency or of the maintenance of such forces in Europe imposing too heavy a drain on the external finances of the United Kingdom. In the latter event her majesty&apos;s Government would be able to ask that the financial conditions should be reviewed by the North Atlantic Council.The Foreign Secretary stated that while such an offer would not be justifiedmerely in order to satisfy the French Assembly, all the other powers assembled inLondon felt that a British offer of this kind might save the situation. In particularDr. Adenauer, the German Federal Chancellor and Mr. Pearson, the CanadianSecretary of State for External Affairs, had appealed to him for a lead in thisdirection. Dr. Adenauer had spoken in a similar sense to the Prime Minister.In discussion it was pointed out that if the offer were made, and the Frenchstill refused to adopt a reasonable attitude, it would subsequently be easier toimpose the solution of &quot; the empty chair.&quot; It was agreed that, while the PrimeMinister might telegraph to President Eisenhower with the object of encouraginga corresponding move on the part of the United States Government, there would beno advantage in making a British offer conditional on the American decision sinceif America withdrew from Europe the whole N.A.T.O. defence system would in anycase collapse.In these circumstances it was generally agreed that the Foreign secretary should have the right to offer, at the time he thought appropriate, the stationing inEurope of four divisions of the British Army, or their equivalent in effectivefighting strength, as well as the Tactical Air Force, subject to the reservationsmentioned in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 298.
