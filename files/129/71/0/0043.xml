Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRET Copy No.   7 4C. (54) 34312th November, 1954CABINETEDUCATION policy memorandum by the Minister of education the central plan of the Education Act of 1944 was to transfer every child at11 to a Secondary School where the education would be free and at the same timeto reduce the size of classes to figures consistent with good teaching. But for threereasons progress has been slow and difficult. First, during and just after the wara million more children were born than had been expected when the Act wasdrafted. Second, the school leaving age was raised in 1947 to 15. Third, since1951 we have built so many houses that hundreds of thousands of children havebeen swept into new estates where there were no schools at all.2. Dame Florence Horsbrugh cut the cost of school building and doubledthe number of new school places completed. But she did not have the resources to make headway both against &quot; the bulge in the birthrate&quot; and against mr.. Macmillan&apos;s triumph as a builder of suburbs. Overcrowding in large classesis worse now than in 1951.   The old slum schools have had to be left untouched.3. The countryside has suffered from the enforced concentration on buildingschools for the new communities on the outskirts of towns. 36 per cent, of the senior children in the rural areas (compared with 9 per cent, in urban areas) arestill being taught in all-age schools, and no building to relieve this position hasbeen allowed since 1952. This injustice to the countryside is rousing the Farmers&apos;Unions, Women&apos;s Institutes and other rural associations. Our opponents will bequick to capitalise the anxieties of our friends.4. Certain things which we have done are increasing the demand for a fairerallocation of resources between housing and schools. The Rent and Repairs Actprovides for slum clearance and reconditioning of (houses. There (is nothingcomparable for old schools. The end of building licensing means that anyonecan build what he likes, including additions to independent schools, provided hehas the money. The public will not stop to think of the financial differencebetween a swimming bath paid for by Old boys of a public school, and runningwater in a village school, which continues not to be provided as a matter ofGovernment policy.5. The Questions already being put on the Order Paper show that if we donot do something more to deal with overcrowded classes and slum buildings, andto push on with technical colleges, we shall find our inaction used with great effect by the Opposition.6. In Appendix A is a list of the minimum improvements which I ask tobe allowed to make. In the financial year 1955-56 I estimate the cost to theExchequer at  300,000 rising to possibly  3 millions in 1958-59. If these plans were agreed we could bring into education some of the feeling of expansion andsuccess which has been the mark of our housing drive.&apos;7. I have carefully considered whether I could offer the Chancellor any economies to sweeten the request for the additional sum required to pay for mynew proposals. -Appendix B shows how difficult it is to make savings when theservice is automatically &quot;expanding with the increase in the number of school-children.47137
8. There remains the squabble over the Teachers&apos; Pensions&apos; Bill. We have lost much goodwill over this business. However true it is on mathematicalcalculations that the Teachers&apos; Pension Account shows a very large and growingdeficiency, many people believe it is intolerable that a profession, not too well paid,should be asked to contribute even another one per cent, when wage-earners andinvestors are seen to be better off than ever before. I doubt if I could get the bill through the House. Even if I did the teachers would not then support the restof my policy wih much enthusiasm, and they might well ask for a special reviewof their salaries which could cost the Treasury more than would be netted fromthe one per cent. Accordingly I submit in Appendix C an alternative plan, whichI have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to wipe out the existingpension scheme and to negotiate with the parties concerned a new one on more modern lines. I cannot say if the negotiation would succeed. Amongst other things we should have to take into consideration the effects of equal pay, if extendedto teachers, and that would mean considerable delay. Therefore, as reported tothe Legislation Committee, there could be no legislation before July.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,11th November, 1954.APPENDIX APROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING education. The Building ProgrammeCapital works are undertaken by Local Authorities with the help of loans,the effect on the Exchequer being limited to a share of the loan charges and of the consequential additions to running costs.The programme which I should like now to put in hand would permit:  (a) Local Authorities and voluntary bodies to do all minor jobs within a limit of  10,000. This is an increase of  2,500 on the present limit and wouldbe specially welcome in rural areas;(b) all schools in rural areas to be reorganised on the basis of a four to fiveyear programme, and work to the value of not more than  5 millions to be started next year;(c) the ban to be removed on playing fields to serve existing maintainedschools;(d) the ban to be removed on building technical colleges for any trainingother than mining, engineering, textiles and building. This is greatlydesired by industry as a means of increasing production under conditions of full employment;(e) the ban to be removed on village halls, community centres and playing fields laid out by voluntary bodies. This kind, of building attractsgrants of about one third of the cost, but it is essential to allow somebuilding for social needs in villages and in new housing estates so thatthose who live there can meet together and enjoy themselves.This programme would make a claim on building resources of not more than 5 millions in 1955-56.2. I understand from the Secretary of State for Scotland that he desires tomake in Scotland broadly similar relaxations of the present restrictions on educational building and on capital grants for village halls, playing fields and community centres. It will not be necessary to carry out in Scotland a programme for the provision of new rural secondary schools like that proposed in England,but there are in Scottish rural areas a few schools which are so unsatisfactory thatthey ought to be replaced as soon as possible. In addition it will be essential tocontinue the expansion of the programme for providing schools in new housingareas in which there are heavy arrears to be made up.
2. Teachers of Science and Mathematics3. I have asked the Burnham Committee to review the arrangements underwhich special salaries are paid to teachers engaged in advanced work, particularlyteachers of science and mathematics. This may lead to proposals for better salariescosting about  f million in all, of which about  450,000 would be met by theExchequer. Increases in the salaries paid to teachers of science and mathematicsin Scotland may also be recommended by the Appleton Committee which isexpected to report in the spring.APPENDIX BECONOMIES IN THE EDUCATION VOTE1. School Meals ServiceMy predecessor was unable to offer the Swinton Committee any economieson my vote, which continues to increase as the teachers&apos; salaries and the school population rise.  But the School Meals Service was left for further consideration.2. The cost is about Is. Id. a meal. The charge was raised from Id. to 9d.in March 1953, since when the proportion of children taking meals has fallen from51 per cent, to 45 per cent. How much this has been due to the increased charge and how much to derationing is not known.3. The Exchequer pays the overheads on the whole service, plus the cost of free meals to children whose parents cannot afford to pay. This amounts to 25 millions a year. The Local Authorities do not contribute. The reason is to befound in Sir John Anderson&apos;s statement in 1943 that family allowances would beintroduced at 5s. Od. instead of the Beveridge Is. 6d. because the Exchequer would bear the cost of free school meals.4. Although school meals have not been made free, the charge to parentshas so far not exceeded the approximate cost of the food. If the charge were nowto be raised above 9d. this principle would be set aside. Raising the charge wouldhit large families hardest and could be represented as regressive taxation.5. If the charge were raised by Id. to I0d., the saving in a year is estimatedat about  1-5 millions on the basis of a 5 per cent, drop in demand. If it were raised by 3d. to Is. Od., the saving in a year is estimated at about  3 - 5 millions onthe basis of a 20 per cent, drop in demand. I cannot advise my colleagues to insist on an unpopular economy which would be felt some considerable time before thebenefits of the building programme could be appreciated by the parents.6. However the principles of the service and, once these were settled and thedemand for meals stabilised, the administration of the service, need a thorough examination. I am ready to undertake such a review, but there would be little prospect of any saving in the year 1955-56.2. Duration of Schooling7. The other economy which has often been considered is to reduce thenumber of children at school by raising the age of entry or lowering the age of leaving. No saving would result unless we stopped recruiting teachers now andplanned for a lower number in the future. This would raise a storm at a timewhen there are still 74,200 classes of more than regulation size (i.e., 40,853 classescontaining more than 40 pupils under 11, and 33,347 classes containing more than30 senior pupils).(a) Raising Age of Entry.8. Now that &quot; the bulge in the birthrate&quot; is moving from primary schoolsto secondary schools we have not as, good an educational argument as we had two or three years ago for raising the age of entry. But even if this were not so,to raise the age above five would be highly unpopular with mothers. Many earnmoney as soon as the child goes to school, and the well-fed child of to-day needs
an occupation by the age of five. He must get out and about. Our climate isdamp and our cities large and not well provided with playgrounds. If a five-yearold is not at school someone must run after him.(b) Lowering the Age of Leaving9. To give parents the option to remove their children at 14 would becondemned as a major retreat from the Act of 1944. In many cases it would bethe children, and those who would most benefit by staying on, who would clamourto leave and earn the  3 a week offered to juveniles. If we, who mostly send ourchildren to boarding schools, encouraged early leaving from county secondary schools, we should present the Opposition with a first-class Election issue.3. General10. I will try to find further economies in the standards of school building and in the minor services, but there is no escape from the fact that when the army of schoolchildren is expanding from five to six millions, and teachers&apos; salaries haveto go up in step with other rewards, and the Act of 1944 is on the Statute book,my vote must rise or the standard of education must fall.APPENDIX CTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONIf we do not proceed with the Bill, as drafted, we must either postpone it orproduce another Bill. Postponement would leave the increased contribution an awkward issue at the Election.2, One basis for a new Bill, which I prefer, would be to write off the accumulated deficiency in the Account and to make the present 5 per cent, rate of-contribution the maximum for all who pay it, and to direct the Burnham Committeeto take into consideration this generous limit in contributions whenever they reviewsalaries. This settlement might well cost the Treasury less than insisting on higher contributions and then having to meet an immediate demand for highersalaries.3. The Chancellor has told me that he would, on certain conditions, be willing to recommend writing off the existing deficiency in the account, but that hewould not,be willing to limit the rate of contributions in the way that I have proposed; he has to consider the repercussions on other pension schemes. I have,therefore, agreed with him to propose to my colleagues that we should announce that the existing Bill is dead, and that representatives of the local authorities and&quot;the teachers Will be invited to negotiate With the Secretary of State for Scotlandand myself a completely new Pension Scheme on a contributory basis.4. The Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with this approach, but there arestill points which we should have to settle with the Chancellor relating to the assumptions on which we should try to negotiate a new pensions scheme. TheChancellor has given his opinion that taking into account Other schemes the rateof interest credited to the teachers&apos; Account must be 3 per cent, against the present rate of 3]- per cent.5. I would have to agree with my colleagues how we present any suchdecision to Parliament in the light of our previous statement. We ^should have tomake clear that we do not intend to allow the contributions, with interest thereon,credited to the Account to be inadequate to sustain the contractual obligations. Itis by no means certain that the teachers would agree to negotiate On the assumptions Whidh the Chancellor arid T take for granted. If I am rebuffed, i will have to bring the matter back to the Cabinet.6. In any case,, the result of such &quot;negotiations would not be ready in time for legislation before July.
