Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954Copy No.CABINETLEGISLATION TO REPLACE EMERGENCY powers memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andthe Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet, on 28th July, invited me to arrange for the drafting of atemporary Bill to continue Defence Regulation 55 and associated regulations forcertain specified purposes on the lines proposed in Appendix II to C (54) 247. TheCabinet further decided that, apart from a Requisitioned Houses Bill, there shouldnot be separate legislation on land and water in the next Session of Parliament(CC (54) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. The implications of these decisions have been studied by the emergency legislation Committee. As a result it has become clear that, although a temporary bill on the restricted basis approved in July could be prepared, it would scarcelybe a worth-while proposition to introduce it unless the Bill could be madecomprehensive and widened to embody a clause on similar lines dealing with theland regulations. If this were not done the existing procedures by which defence regulations are continued, including the annual motions in both Houses tocontinue the Supplies and Services Acts and the Emergency Laws Acts, wouldhave to go on; meanwhile we should have complicated matters further by addinga third renewal procedure, for the economic powers alone. This would not bea happy result. The comprehensive Bill including the land clause, and the restrictedBill without it, would entail exposing, for debate on the floor of the House andin Committee, the itemised purposes for which the economic control regulationsare still needed, but the political reward to be derived from the latter would notbe commensurate with the efforts required to enact it.3. In these circumstances the Emergency Legislation Committee firstexamined the possibility of a comprehensive Emergency Laws Bill dealing with landon the same temporary basis as had been approved by the Cabinet for the economicpart of the Bill. They found that, although it might be possible to draft a clausetemporarily continuing the land regulations for a number of specified purposes onthe model of the treatment proposed for the economic control regulations, theclause would not be acceptable to the Service Departments unless the purposeswent appreciably beyond those proposed for permanent legislation (see Appendix Ito C (54) 247). Even if this difficulty could have been resolved, the clause on any basis would have had to itemise the purposes for which the land regulations might continue to be used and these would then be open to debate in detail during thepassage of the Bill.4. It accordingly seemed desirable to consider whether an Order in council could not be drafted which would serve broadly the same object as the cabinet had in mind in inviting me to arrange for a Bill to be drafted narrowing the scopeof the Economic Control Regulations. Such an Order could moreover be made immediately so as to fit in with the annual renewal of Defence Regulations inNovember and come into operation on 1st January next. It would be in the natureof a partial revocation of the relevant regulations and would set out the limitedpurposes for which they might in future be exercised. While this might provokecomment during the renewal debates objectors could at the worst put down a Prayeragainst the Order as compared with the Opportunities for detailed amendmentoffered by a Bill.5.  An Order in Council on these lines has now been prepared.   No doubtexists as to vires but the Order would not, I understand, remove from a future government the power to reinstate by a further Order in Council the full range of46964SECRETC.

powers of economic control within the purposes laid down in the Supplies and services Acts. Such an instrument would none the less be valuable as a formaldeclaration of intent by this Government to reduce these controls to the barestminimum possible, and the existence of such an Order would certainly make itawkward for a future Government to put the clock back.6. Not without reluctance I and my colleagues on the Emergency legislation committee have reached the conclusion that we must give up the idea of a Billnext Session and with it the objective we have held before us of dealing finally with defence Regulations within the lifetime of this Government. Instead we invitethe Cabinet to agree that there should be an Order-in-Council on the lines indicatedin paragraph 4. If this course is approved the Cabinet will, no doubt, think it right to remit to the Ministerial Committee on Emergency Legislation responsibilityfor settling the precise terms of the Order.7. I must also invite the Cabinet to consider afresh the question of Bills tobe included in next Session&apos;s programme dealing with residual emergency legislation. If there is to be neither an Emergency Laws Bill nor a permanentAcquisition and Use of Land Bill, the three measures so far contemplated cannot in our view be regarded as an adequate instalment. These three Bills are Requisitioned Houses approved by the Cabinet on 28th July; Food andDrugs (Scotland) carried over from the present Session;Tube Shelters a hybrid Bill necessary to meet criticism by a Select Committee.8. There is a strong case for adding to the list three further measures; theseare:  Inventions and Designs (Defence);Aliens in Crown Service; and water.The Inventions and Designs (Defence) Bill is properly to be regarded as a carry-over from the present Session. It is the successor to the Inventions and Designs(Crown Use) Bill, but omitting the provisions which caused the withdrawal ofthat measure in the Lords last December. The Bill is essential before the Defence(Patents, Trade Marks, &amp;c.) Regulations can be revoked; it will also do away with the need for the two annual motions continuing certain temporary provisionsof the Patents and Registered Designs Acts. In accordance with the recommenda-tions of the Home Affairs Committee, the President of the Board of Trade hasarranged for discussions with the industrial organisations concerned in theproposals in the revised Bill. These discussions have not yet been concluded, butthere is hope that the organisation will accept the proposed measure. In thecircumstances I am sure that it would be wrong to omit the Bill from the next session&apos;s programme. The Aliens in Crown Service and Water Bills have bothbeen approved in principle by the Home Affairs Committee. They would revokethree of the Defence (General) Regulations outright, namely, D.Rs. 60D, 50Aand 56, as well as reducing reliance on D.Rs. 50 and 51. The Water Bill doesnot, strictly speaking, form part of the land legislation with which the cabinet was mainly concerned when they decided in July not to proceed with separateland and water legislation, and it would be an advantage to dispose of itbeforehand. If all six Bills can be included in the programme they will securethe revocation next year of a further 15 of the 71 regulations we expect will need to be renewed this year, and I invite the Cabinet to agree that they should proceed.9.   I invite the Cabinet (a) to take note of the reasons why it will not be practicable to proceed withthe Emergency Laws Bill restricted to the Economic ControlRegulations alone;(b) to approve, as an alternative, the making of an Order in Council havingthe object of narrowing the scope of the Economic Control regulations and to remit to the Ministerial Committee on Emergency Legislationresponsibility for approval of the terms of the Order; and(c) to agree to include in the legislative programme for the next Session theInventions and Designs (Defence), Aliens in Crown Service and WaterBills, subject, in the case of the first, to the Home Affairs Committeebeing satisfied as to its acceptability to the affected interests.D.
