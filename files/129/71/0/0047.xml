secret. (54) 34715th November, 1954CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS:MAINTENANCE BASE AT RENFREWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland as I made clear to the Home Affairs Committee, I do notdispute the case made on financial grounds by the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation.    I suggest, however, that, on the broadest social,economic and political grounds, we should not agree to the transfer of theBritish European Airways&apos; (B.E.A.) maintenance work from Renfrew toLondon until alternative aircraft work has been found for Renfrew,2. The B.E.A. base was established at Renfrew in 1949 with aflourish of trumpets;  and great credit has since been taken for the majorcontribution it has made to the building up - belatedly - of an aircraft industry in Scotland.    The fact that the aircraft industry has in the mainestablished itself in England and Wales is a matter about which there is strong feeling in Scotland.    Both parties have undertaken to do all they canto encourage development in Scotland; and we can claim that the recentassistance promised for the Prestwick Pioneer is an example of our goodintentions.    We shall, however, lose heavily in public estimation if we nowallow the Renfrew base to close.    As the Minister recognises, Scottishopinion in Parliament and outside, and irrespective of party, has shown itself solidly in favour of its retention.3. I concede that B.E.A. have made out their case that over thenext five years a transfer to London of the maintenance work now done atRenfrew will effect an average saving of about  160,000 a year.4. But we must look at the other side of the case.    We shall be accused of concurring in a transfer to London of aircraft work now done ina development area, of adding, to however small an extent, to the concentration of aircraft work in the most vulnerable parts of the country,and of dealing an unnecessary blow to the small and struggling industry inScotland,    We shall be told - not without justification - that it makesnonsense of our development area policy if we build factories at greatexpense in the development areas and then let a nationalised industry with-draw part of its work from a development area to London,    The Oppositionwill point out that in the debates on the Civil Aviation Bill in 1946 they undertook that the Government would do all in its power to encourage thedevelopment of an aircraft industry in Scotland; that they were instru-mental in establishing the Rolls Royce factory at East Kilbride; and that had they remained in office they would, in accordance with their undertaking,have seen that the Renfrew base remained in use.    I need not stress thepolitical consequences of all this.COPY NO.
5C It is true that only some 600 men are involved and that about half will be offered - though they may well decline to accept - employmentin London,    But the drain of skilled men to London will merely add to thestrength of the criticism;  and the most will be made of the remainingredundancy, especially as the prospects of finding employment for the menin Scotland ai*e net good.    The demands for Scottish engineering workers are diminishing - in particular there is no demand for the aero-fitterswho will comprise the bulk of the redundant skilled workers - and the semi-skilled and unskilled v/ill also create a difficult problem.    Rolls Royceare closing their fa.factory at Larkhall and there is already grave concern about the possibility of maintaining employment in the Rolls Royce factoriesat East Kilbride and Kiilington,    In fact the firm are already allowing $heirlabour force to run down.60 In all the circumstances, I remain firmly of the view whichI expressed to the Home Affairs Committee that a decision to authorisethe proposed transfer from Renfrew to London should be deferred, andthat in the meantime everything possible should be done to secure analternative and satisfactory tenant for the Renfrew premises.J oS oScottish Office, S.W..1.15th November, 1954.
