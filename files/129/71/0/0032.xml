It is issued for the personal use of .........................................;...................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 3324th November, 1954CABINETDEFENCE POLICY: THE FLEET AIR ARMMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty had hoped to be present when the Cabinet discussed the report annexed to C. (54) 329, which contains a number of expressions of opinion and recom-mehdations which are not in accordance with the views of the Board of admiralty and to which the First Sea Lord and I have taken every opportunity of objecting.As I cannot be present I must place the Admiralty&apos;s views on record.2. We do not think the report realistic. It fails to take into account the cumulative effect on the Navy of severe cuts already made and of the further reductions envisaged by the Board and the previous Minister of Defence. Theserepresent the limit of the contribution that the Admiralty can make towardsreductions in the Defence Budget.3. In particular, there is one recommendation in the Report which the Boardmust resist. This relates to heavy carriers. The searching discussions of the pastmonths have brought clearly into focus the strategic role of the Fleet Air Arm a role complementary to, and not in competition with, that of the Royal Air Force.Heavy carriers with their full complement of the right types of aircraft are essential in order that we may be ready to undertake our share of the Allied naval task.4. These carriers alone can embark and operate simultaneously sufficientaircraft to provide early-warning, fighter and anti-submarine defence and thenlaunch a worth-while blow at whatever threatens us by sea.5. The Committee&apos;s proposal would deny us carriers capable of taking their place in the covering force on which our control of the sea depends. The First sea lord and I have repeatedly expressed our strong dissent and Lord Alexander alsorecorded his firm opposition both on strategic and operational grounds and becauseof the effect abroad.6.   The present Board of Admiralty feels most strongly in this matter.7. Discussion during this review on the strategic role of the Fleet Air Armhas already covered some years ahead and the Board can see no reason forsuggesting that further investigation should be undertaken at the present time;though no doubt the new Minister of Defence would wish to study this subjectamong others.8.   I should welcome the Cabinet&apos;s early endorsement of the Board&apos;s view onthis issue which affects the Navy so gravely, but if further information is required -I hope that discussion may be adjourned to enable me to be present.J.P.L.T.Admiralty, S.W.1,4th November, 1954.47097
