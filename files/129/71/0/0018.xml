secret.(54) 318 COPY NO.   ip^2Oth October, 1954CABINETUNITED STATES/UNITED KINGDOM LOAN agreement memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in discussions with the Secretary of the United States Treasuryduring my recent visit to Washington, I raised the question of the U.S.A./United Kingdom Loan Agreement.    In the light of that discussion I should now like to advise my colleagues of the position, as I see it, in regardto:-(a) our proposals for revision of the Agreement; and(b) payment of the 1954 annuity under the Agreement.Revision of the Agreement2.        My colleagues will remember that in accordance with thedecision of the Cabinet on 29th June, 1953 (C.C.(53) 37th Conclusions,Minute 5) we presented an Aide-Memoire to the United States Administra-tion, in which we proposed revision of the Agreement by the excision ofSection 6(iii).    That Section (which must be fulfilled before we can claim,under the provisions of the Loan Agreement, that a payment of interestshould be waived) contains complicated provisions about the movement of sterling balances.    It would have debarred us from even claiming the waiver in 1951 and 1952, when we needed it, and the uncertainty about themeaning of the Section would have made a claim for the waiver verydifficult to establish in 1953, even if we had been minded to claim it.We have not received a written reply to our Aide Memoire, nor have we made any real progress in our discussions with the United states administration so far, although the United Kingdom case for revisionhas been pressed upon them on several occasions, both at the official and Ministerial level.    Apparently the Administration do not contestour view that Section 6(iii) is highly unsatisfactory - being obscure,impracticable and arbitrary in its results.    A final decision would,however, rest with Congress, to which any revision would have to besubmitted.    In response to our pressures, Mr. Humphrey testedCongressional opinion about a revision in the early summer, but could make no headway.    He has agreed that there should be further consultation between the two Governments after the next session of congress opens, and has expressed his readiness, in the light of that,to consider a second approach to Congressional leaders.It is unsatisfactory that our proposals for revision should driftin this way.    We cannot exclude the possibility that we might need the waiver some time and find, as in the past, that any claim to it would be
&amp;7frustrated owing to the unsatisfactory nature of Section 6(iii).    We have at present, however, no effective means of persuading the administration to make a move.    I have it in mind to broach this subject again early next year in accordance with Mr. Humphrey&apos;s suggestion above, but Iam not hopeful about the outcome.Payment of the 1954 Instalment3.        Preliminary examination of the qualifying conditions for the waiver for 1954 shows that we could easily satisfy the &quot;needs&quot; test inparagraph 5(b) of the Agreement, but we have no prospects of satisfyingany feasible interpretation of Section 6(iii).    We will, therefore, haveno option but to pay in full the service of the United States loan inDecember of this year - and, consequently, also of the Canadian line-of-credit.    This, however, need not be a matter for concern.    Our affairshave prospered so well in the past year that a claim to the waiver would on general grounds have been inappropriate.I have it in mind to advise the United States and canadian government&apos;s during the next few weeks that the service of the loanswill be paid in the normal way and in full at 31st December, 1954.    Theinterest element (to which alone the waiver clause relates) amounts toabout S108 millions on both loans, and the total annuities, includingcapital, to about 2*177 millions.    At the same time, I think it would bewell to remind the United States Administration then that we stillattach great importance to an early and satisfactory outcome of our proposals for revision of the Agreement.4.        I seek the agreement of my colleagues to proceeding asindicated in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.16th October, 1954.-2-
