TOP SECRET Copy No...^.T*.C0(54) 3369th November, 1954CABINETUGANDA PROTECTORATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesJudgment in the Uganda High Court case was given on 4th November and at Annex A is a copy of a letter which the Attorney-general has sent to me setting out the findings together with his comments on them.2. The salient points which emerge from the judgment are thefollowing(i)   The Crown has been technically successful in the action in that all the declarations andthe injunction sought by the Plaintiffs havebeen refused.(ii) Article 6 of &quot;the Agreement under which the Crownpurported to act has been held not to have beenapplicable to the circumstances of the case.(iii)  The Judge has expressed the view that the I abaka&apos;refusal to abide by decisions on policyconstituted a disregard of his duty under the termsof the Agreement to acknowledge and abide by theoverrule of the Crown and that it would therefore have been open to the Crown to terminate the wholeAgreement under Article 20.    The Judge addedthat recognition could have been withdrawn as an act of State.Copies of the relevant provisions of Articles 6 and 20 of the BugandaAgreement are attached (Annex B).3, Put in simple terms I understand the effect to be this:-(a) The Kabaka was disloyal and the Crown wastherefore justified in taking action against him.This could properly have been done only bydenouncing the Agreement (under Article 20)or by exercising the prerogative and disregardingthe Agreement altogether.(b) By proclaiming its continued adherence to theAgreement - as the Crown did in the case - andmisapplying the provisions of Article 6, the Crownhas acted in breach of the Agreement.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...:....:...........:....;.
(c)   The ^abaka has no legally enforceableredress for this breach.4. It is possible that the Plaintiffs may appeal against the finding that Article 6 creates no legal rights enforceable by the Court.In such an event I am advised that the Crown could file a cross-appeal,e. g. , to establish that Article 6 is not justiciable by the Courts if that isnecessary - there is some doubt as to the Chief Justice&apos;s finding in thisrespect or on the Court&apos;s finding regarding the applicability of Article 6to the circumstances of the case.    It is, however, more likely that thePlaintiffs will awa.it an announcement of Government policy before deciding to lodge an appeal, and unless the Plaintiffs do appeal the Crown has no right or opportunity of appeal,,5. I would not feel disposed to encourage appeal proceedings.They would be of no value to us unless it were possible to upset the findingon the-applicability of Article 6 to the circumstances of the case and the attorney-General advises that the Chief Justice might well be upheld onthis finding.    The Attorney-General further advises that if the appellateCourt were persuaded to consider the Chief Justice&apos;s obiter opinion aboutthe applicability of Article 20 (see paragraph 2 (iii) above) he does notthink they would agree with it.    Moreover, I am sure it is politically off first importance that, at the earliest possible moment, the currentuncertainty regarding the Governments action in the new situation should be resolved; that would be virtually impossible so long as legal proceedings are pending.6. I have given very careful and anxious thought to the course tobe adopted in the light of this finding that we have acted in breach of theAgreement and I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we have no option in these circumstances but to permit Mutesa&apos;s return on certain conditions.    We have at all times stressed the great importance we attach to the scrupulous observance of the Agreement by both sides and I am satisfied that it would be extremely difficult, and probably impossible to sustain his continued exclusion now that we have been found in default underthe Agreement.    This view is shared not only by the Governor but also by nearly all those of his advisers who had opposed Mutesa&apos;s return in the eventof our obtaining a favourable judgment.    Moreover, I am advised that, in thenew circumstances, if we decided to stand firm on the present decision, thiswould almost certainly result in a long period of non-cooperation in Bugandanecessitating direct rule, if it did not lead to actual disturbances.    It wouldalso kill any chance of acceptance by the Baganda of the recommendations ofthe Constitutional Conference which, in providing for participation by theBaganda in Protectorate affairs, have themselves resolved the issue whichwas the main cause of dispute leading to withdrawal of recognition.7. I am, however, equally sure that Mutesa should only bereturned on the terms which we lay down.    The opportunity for laying downthese terms is provided partly by the Court finding that he was in fact dis-loyal in 1953 and partly by the agreed recommendations of the constitutional conference whereunder the Kabaka will become a constitutional ruler andthe administration of Buganda will be assumed by Ministers in his name.The first factor can be regarded as justifying the drastic action taken against him in 1953.    It would certainly justify the Government in now taking stepsto ensure that his return only takes place in circumstances which will makeit difficult, if not impossible, for him to repeat the offence5  the secondfactor provides those circumstances.
8. I accordingly propose that his return should be made subjectto the following conditions(i) The acceptance by the Lukiko of theconstitutional recommendations asa whole.(ii)  Twelve months1 grace during which time thenew constitutional arrangements in Bugandacan become established.(iii) At the end of that period the Lukiko to be free to choose a Kabaka and if they chooseMutesa, Her MajestyJs Government willre-recognise him and permit his returnto Uganda.(iv)  The Kabaka to enter into the solemn engagementprescribed by the agreed recommendations forthe constitution of Buganda whereby hesurrenders his direct rule.If this proposal is accepted I would propose to announce the decision ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the House on 17th November when I expect the Agreed Recommendations of the Constitutional Conference to be ready for simultaneous publication.9. It is possible (though perhaps not likely) that our terms willbe refused.    &quot;Whether or not they are refused, it is, in my view, likely thatextreme nationalist elements, encouraged by our change of policy overMutesa, will before long start some new agitation.    If either of these thingshappens, very firm action will be necessary; but firm action will be morejustifiable and more acceptable to public opinion both here and in Africaif it has been preceded by what I believe moderate opinion will regard as areasonable offer for a settlement of the Mutesa issue,10. I hope that my colleagues will agree with my conclusions which I have reached reluctantly but which seem to me inevitable for thereasons explained in paragraph 6;  and that they will authorise me to proceed on the lines proposed.A.L-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.9th November, 1954,
ANNEX AKABAKA OF BUGANDANote by the Attorney-general on the Judgment of 4th November, 1954,of the Chief Justice of Uganda1. Diplock for the Plaintiffs submitted that there were thefollowing three issues for con side ration :-1st IssueDoes the Agreement (the 1900 Agreement) form partof the constitution of Uganda so as to create clearlyenforceable rights and liabilities?2nd IssueIf so, is the Secretary of State the sole judge of whether   &quot;the Kaba.ka, Chiefs and people of Uganda&quot;are co-operating loyally with Ker Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the   &quot;organisation and administration&quot;  of this Kingdom ?3rd IssueHad any right to withdraw recognition under Article of the Agreement arisen on 30th November, 1953, andas a subsidiary question, if so, did the right to with-hold recognition subsist after 17th December, 1953?The Chief Justice dealt with these issues in his Judgment.2. With regard to the 1st Issue, he held that  &quot;the Agreement inso far as incorporated in statute does so form a part of the constitution asto create clearly enforceable rights and liabilities&quot;.    He reserved  &quot;forconsideration of the second issue the question of whether or not all mattershinging on the Agreement are fully or partly justiciable by this Court&quot;.The Chief Justice does not in his judgment express the opinionthat Article 6 was incorporated in any statute.    So far as I am aware it hasnot been and consequently on this ground the Chief Justice in my view shouldhave held that the claim of the Plaintiffs based as it was on Article 6 wasnot justiciable by him.3. With regard to the 2nd Issue, the Chief Justice said the answer was   &quot;Yes&quot;.    The basis of his decision on this Issue would appear to be that&quot;The nature of the administration and organisation and the part which eachof these parties was playing are matters which must of their nature be the concern and within the knowledge only of the Secretary of State and otherexecutive officers of the Crown&quot;.The Chief Justice also attached importance to the fact that hadthe Attorney-General of Uganda not been joined as a party to the action andhad there not been full discovery, the Court would not have had before it anymaterials on which to decide whether or not there had been a breach ofArticle 69&apos;
I think that the 2nd Issue and the Chief JusticeJs statement that  &quot;the Crown can be and is the judge of its own case under Article 6&quot;were unfortunately and inaccurately phrased.    If a man decides to repudiatean agreement because on information he alone possesses, he believes thatthe other party has been guilty of a breach, that does not constitute the man who repudiates a judge in his own case.    In the case of a breach of contractwhether he was entitled to repudiate, may be decided in the courts of his country.    In the case of a Treaty, there may be no court which can determine whether the repudiation was justified.If there is an appeal, I should expect the appellate court notto agree with the form of the Chief Justice&apos;s answer to this question.4. In dealing with the 2nd Issue, the Chief Justice did not answer the question he posed and reserved for consideration on the 2nd Issue,namely  &quot;whether or not all matters hinging on the Agreement are fully or partly justiciable by this Court&quot;.    He has not in terms stated anywhere inhis judgment that Article 6 was justiciable by him or that it was not.    Hehas not expressed the opinion that Article 6 was incorporated in any statute.As I understand the position it has not been8 and consequently in my opinion the Chief Justice should have held that a claim on Article 6 was notjusticiable by him050 The Chief Justice said that in withdrawing recognition her majesty&apos;s Government  &quot;purported to apply an assertion of legal rights underArticle 6 of the Agreement and not to apply an Act of State&quot;.    This state -ment I find it difficult to understand save upon the assumption that the chief justice held the view that exercise by the United Kingdom of rights under aTreaty is not an Act of State.    In my opinion exercise of such rights is an Actj  State, and the fact that we asserted that our action was in accordance withour right under the 1 900 Agreement, does not alter the character of our action and make it something other than an Act of State.6. It is not easy to determine from the judgment whether the chief justice held that he had or had not jurisdiction to try the case.    While thereare some passages which tend to support the view that he held that he hadnot, he said that  &quot;recognition of the Kabaka could have been withdrawn as an act of State in which event the matter would clearly have not been justiciablein this Court&quot;.    This seems to me to imply that he regarded the claim aswithin his jurisdiction.    He appears to base his decision upon the fact thatin his view we asserted legal rights.    The essence of his judgment might be stated as follows:-&quot;As Her Majesty&apos;s Government have asserted legalrights,T have jurisdiction to try this claim but when Icome to examine the question whether the 1900 Agreementgave the Kabaka any right to recognition enforceable bythis Court, the answer is No&quot;.7. The Chief Justice went on to hold that &quot;Article 6 is not a termof a contract carrying mutual obligations enforceable by this Court&quot;.    Hebased this on his finding that the Crown can be and is the judge of its own caseunder Article 6.A Treaty is a contract between states.    It may contain mutualobligations, though the only court which can decide whether there is a breach of those obligations may be the International Courto
\-LTJIn my view Article 6 of the 1900 Agreement did containmutual obligations.    We bound ourselves to recognise the Kabaka as nativeruler so long as the Kabaka Chiefs and people complied with two obligations.I agree that the obligations were not enforceable by a decision of the chief justice not on account of the Crown being a judge in its own case but becausethe matter was not within his jurisdiction.8. The Judge having answered the second issue in the affirmativewent on to answer the 3rd Issue as a matter of convenience in the event ofan appeal.    He expressed the view that the application of Article 6 to thefacts of the situation which had arisen on 30th November, 1953, was mistakenand that a right under Article 6 of the Agreement to withdraw recognitionhad not arisen on 30th November, 1953.He bases this conclusion on two grounds:(a) that to entitle Her Majesty&apos;s Government towithdraw recognition under Article 6, there must bea failure to co-operate loyally on the part of the kabaka, Chiefs and People and not on the part ofthe Kabaka alone j(b) that the disregard by the Kabaka of his dutyunder the Agreement to acknowledge and abide bythe over-rule of the Crown and the evincing by the kabaka of an intention to pursue a disloyal policydid not constitute a failure to co-operate loyallyin the organisation and administration of the Kingdomof Buganda.While the Chief Justice has given a narrow interpretation tothe words organisation and administration, I doubt very much whether aCourt would hold the Kabaka&apos;s refusal to accept the Secretary of State*decision as to transfer of responsibility from the Colonial Office to theForeign Office, as to a time-table for independence, his refusal to nominatemembers of the Legislative Council and his intention to tell his people, ascoming within the phrase   &quot;organisation and administration of the Kingdomof Buganda&quot;.Nor do I think that it is by any means certain that the chief justice&apos;s conclusion that there must be failure on the part of the KabakaChiefs and people and not of the Kabaka alone can be reversed.    The argu-ments are evenly balanced.    The Chief Justice appears to have treated thewords   &quot;Kabaka, Chiefs and people&quot;  as similar in their content to   &quot;Mayor,Aldermen and Burgesses&quot;.90 The Chief Justice expressed the opinion that it was   &quot;manifestthat the Kabaka having evinced (an) intention, to pursue (a) disloyal policyit was clearly within the right of Her Maj-stys&apos; Government to exercise the right reserved by Article 20 of the Agreement and declare the Agree-ment to be at an end&quot;.I doubt the correctness of this obiter opinion.    To evince an intention to pursue a disloyal policy does not seem to me to be equivalentto pursuing a policy which is distinctly disloyal.

To evince an intention to pursue a disloyal policy does not seem to me to be equivalentto pursuing a policy which is distinctly disloyal,,
10. For the reasons given, I regard the judgment as extremely-vulnerable.If the Flaintiffs appeal and we do not succeed in establishingthat there is no jurisdiction in the Courts of Uganda to try the case, theywould in my opinion have a very good chance of establishing that Article 6did contain mutual obligations and that the Secretary of State was not the sole judge of whether there had been a breach of that Article.    If the appellate court were persuaded to consider the Chief 3&apos;ustice&apos;s obiteropinion referred to in paragraph 9, I do not think they would agree with it.If the Plaintiffs appeal, we should in my opinion enter a crossappeal alleging that the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction, and try to get this issue determined first.    For the reasons given I doubt whether we should succeed in disturbing the Chief Justice&apos;s interpretation of &quot;organisationand administration&quot;  in Article 6 though there is in my view a betterprospect of securing a reversal of his decision on the effect of the words&quot;Kabaka, Chiefs and people&quot;.ANNEX BEXTRACTS FROM UGANDA A GRE E MS NT, 19Q0&quot;Article 6.
