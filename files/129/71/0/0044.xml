secret. (54) 344 Copy No.12th November, 1954CABINETINVESTMENT AND housing memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Our economic position is healthier than it has been for some time. Our tasknow must be to consolidate what we have gained and to move forward to increasingnational prosperity. I am convinced that this requires a greater volume of investment, and that we must ensure that we invest in the right things.2. The greatest achievement of the present Government in this field is thehousing programme. We originally set ourselves a target of 300,000 houses a year.This was triumphantly exceeded in 1953, and it is probable that we shall buildabout 350,000 in 1954.3. The great success of this programme has resulted in higher pressure on our resources generally. So far we have avoided a return of inflation, and have maintained an exceptionally high level of employment. Indeed, housing hasswollen our production figures. It is only too easy, however, to relax our vigilanceand to mortgage in advance all the increases which we expect in the national income. I feel sure that this was one of the main causes of the recurrent balanceof payments crises of the previous Administration. There are not unlimitedresources available for investment, and our problem is to find room for thoseincreases which are demanded by the national interest. Increases in the national income are almost automatically accompanied by some increases in consumption,and these are in themselves desirable, but the first priority must be an increasein industrial investment. This will require an expansion both in building and inplant and equipment. I very much hope that the change in the investmentallowance which I introduced in the last Budget, and the publicity which we as aGovernment have given to the necessity for industrial development, are having their effect. But if rapid growth is to take place, as the national interest requires,we must ensure that there is room for it. We should therefore consider what we wish to do in the field of Government investment. The last controls on buildinggenerally have just been removed, and there may be particular pressure on this industry, with consequent delay and congestion throughout the economy.4. My colleagues are naturally thinking of the arrears in investment in the fields for which they are severally responsible, and I have sympathy for theiraspirations, but it is only by our general policies of financial prudence that we havebeen able to restore freedom to the public without the return of inflation. leaving aside the claims of defence there are powerful cases to be made for fresh investment,for example: rural schools and technical colleges need modernising, the fuel and power industries are expected to continue to expand, the railways are now preparingimprovement plans and there is strong pressure for increased expenditure on theroads. The increase in the number of motor vehicles, both private and commercial,is leading to severe congestion, which is increasingly wasteful of fuel and man-power. The Minister of Transport is preparing detailed proposals for increasedinvestment in the roads. Some considerable increase in this field may well prove to be needed. The increasing need for investment in transport will mean that less is available elsewhere.47138Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954
25. It is against this background that I revert to the position of housing. Bynext; spring, we shall have built over 1,000,000 houses since the General Election.Our discussions last summer showed that we were nearing the point at which heavysubsidies for new houses could be justified only for special and relatively long-.        term problems slum clearance, congestion of population, new towns, the Clyde8&apos;j     Valley, &amp;c.6. Even after the subsidy reduction last June, the subsidy in England andWales (Exchequer and rates) is equivalent to nearly  700 on the average capital costof  1,583 for a house with much larger subsidies for flats; in Scotland, the subsidyhas not been cut in accordance with the reduction in interest rates, and is nowequivalent to  1,340.7. Indeed, our housing success has nearly doubled the subsidy load on theBudget:  i 1 Subsidy on permanent houses	England and Wales   millions	Scotland   millions	Total   millions1951-52        ...........	24 0	6-2	30-21953-54        ...........	33-5	8-4	41-91954-55 (Estimate)  ...      ......	42 0	10-0	52-01955-56 (Forecast Estimate)	47-1	11-5	58-6This is a rapidly growing commitment, and it goes on for 60 years.8. Both on social grounds and on Budgetary grounds we should, in my judgment, now be justified in bringing about a steady reduction in the amountof subsidised house-building. Unless we do there is a real risk, as matters nowstand, that we shall over-burden the building industry. Private house-buildinghas responded very well to freedom from control, and we must be sure that wedo not put obstacles in its way.9. Thus the time has come to create some room in the economy to allowprivate building and industrial investment to expand further, and to permitincreased investment in roads and possibly, to a very limited extent, in some other government investment. The right way to get this masse de manoeuvre is by adefinite reduction in subsidised housing.Conclusion10. I therefore recommend that in England and Wales immediate steps should be taken to reduce the authorisations for local authority house-building.The present figure is 180,000 a year. We had better not go below 140,000 a year.So many houses are already under construction that there will certainly be notless than 350,000 completed in 1955, taking Great Britain as a whole. So we have every reason to throttle back thereafter, and that is what my proposal is intendedto do. We can only control completions in 1956 by restricting authorisations now.Ti. In Scotland it would no doubt be difficult to impose effective directcentral control on the local authorities&apos; house-building, so that the only way to influence it is to modify the subsidy. It was agreed in June that the Scottishsubsidy should not be reduced in accordance with the reduction in the rate ofinterest, pending the determination of Government policy on the Sorn Report.Since it is now clear that we shall not be enacting the latter reforms in 1954-55,it would seem that we must now face the reduction of the subsidy. I am discussing the problem with the Secretary of State for Scotland.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,11th November, 1954.
