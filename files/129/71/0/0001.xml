C ON FIDS N T IA. LC.(54) 30129th September, 1954COPY NO.   SLCABINETROMAN TEMPLE IN THE CITY OF london memorandum by the Minister of Wor-LcsThere&apos;s a fascination franticIn a ruin that&apos;s romantic - W.S. GilbertSince the Cabinet discussed the Temple of Mithras on21st September (C. C. (54) 6lst Conclusions, Minute 6) the public desire for its preservation has, if anything, increased.2.        Archaeologists generally, and my Chief Inspector of ancient monuments, continue to tell me that the Temple is not as important asseveral other discoveries of Roman remains now being made.     If more money were available for preserving ancient monuments they would prefer to spend it elsewhere.3.        On the other hand the public imagination has been deeply stirredby the drama of Mithras versus Mammon.    I cannot tell whether, if theTemple were off the danger list, it would prove an exception to ourunvaried experience that Roman remains attract very few visitors.     Thenew factor in this case is the television newsreel which has been thechief agent in creating interest.    But I doubt if this interest would last.4.        The following is the owners1 estimate of the cost of preserving the Temple on its present site:- (a) Structural costs (retaining wallsaround Temple - bridge, etc. ) 110,000(b) Costs arising from delay -6 months&apos; net revenue   155,0006 months&apos; interest on capital 35,000 190,000(c) Loss on rentable accommodation 330,000600,0005.        My consulting engineers advise me that the subsoil is so spongyand unstable that the 60 ft. span of the arch over the Temple could not carry more than two storeys against the seven planned.

There is work of the balue of more than  4 millions waiting  tobe done to bring the 600 monuments already in my charge to a satisfactorystate of repair.8.        Sir Alan Lascelles and Lord Dundee, Chairmen of the english and Scottish Historic Buildings Councils, report that the  250,000 a year&apos;s  far less than will be needed to help houses in the very first rank ofimportance.9.        I cannot therefore recommend that if substantial extra money is available for preservation it should be spent on the Temple.10.       Mr. A. V. Bridgland, the Chairman of the Company which ownsthe site, has offered at his expense to re-erect the Temple at groundlevel in one of the courtyards on the site.    I recommend that this mostgenerous and sensible proposal be accepted.11.        The Appendix to this paper is a letter from Mr. Nigel Nicolson, M.P.the only Member of Parliament who is on the Ancient Monuments Board for england..D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.I.29th September, 1954.
(oAPPENDIXHouse of Commons,S.W.I.26th September, 1954.Dear Eccles,As I am the only Member of the House who is on the ancient monuments Board, I thought I would write you a note about my attitude to the preservation of the Cannon Street Roman Temple.If you decided not to make any grant towards the huge cost of preserving the Temple, I would entirely support you.    All my instinctslead me to plead with you to save it, but I feel it would be wrong to doso, for the preservation of the Temple, as distinct from its discovery,is really of little importance.    Its archaeological value lies in its existence,its ground plan and the objects found in it.    In itself it isnot an object of beauty, and its dismembered stones would mean little to any but professional archaeologists.    If it were preserved, few people would visit it, and even those that did would see it as part of abasement, surrounded perhaps by boilers and certainly by cement walls,which would kill any atmosphere of Roman London.    If there is to beany additional grant for archaeology, there are a dozen-better ways of using it, for instance in the excavation of other blitzed sites in the City.Indeed, one way of mollifying public indignation about the Miihraeurcmight be to make a grant for exactly that purpose.I arn of course speaking purely for myself, and I believe that most of the members of the Ancient Monuments Board disagree with me.Although I went over the whole site with Grimes before it became news,I did not discuss the question of preservation with him.If you have already decided to make a grant towards itspreservation, I shall of course not oppose you, and I was very glad thatyou personally took such energetic action to allow the Temple to be fully excavated.Yours sincerely,(Signed) NIGEL NICOLSON
