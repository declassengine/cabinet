/Oo(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 32827th October, 1954CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have read the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposals in C. (54) 321.It is my clear understanding of our discussions before the susrAmcr 3*ecossthat my colleagues agreed that the Overseas Information Services should be exempted from the economies which Lord Swinton&apos;s Committee was considering. .2.    I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by a furtherMinisterial Committee investigating this problem.    It has already been thesubject of three different investigations, including one by Ministers.All these enquiries have endorsed the need for expanding our information services.&apos; - .3.    I can only repeat that the efficient conduct of our foreign policyrequires the expansions recommended by the Drogheda Committee.    recent developments in the foreign field reinforce this need.    I must therefore ask my colleagues for an urgent decision on this matter which has now beenoutstanding for well over a year and must renew my recommendation thatthe proposals of the Home Secretary&apos;s Committee should be accepted without further delay.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.27th October, 1954.COPY NO.
