On these sure foundations of national prosperity My Ministers will findincreasing scope for pursuing social policies directed to the happiness and well-being of all My People.17. My Government are very sensible of the difficulties of many of My people who are old age or disablement pensioners.   The first five-yearly report on the

They will introduce early legislation to authorise increases in retirement pensions and the other benefits provided under the National insurance schemes for the victims of industrial accidents and diseases, for widows, the sick and the unemployed. There will be corresponding increases in pensions for thosedisabled in war and war widows.18.

Legislation will be laid before you dealing with the problem ofrequisitioned houses, and certain other matters relating to housing and slum clearance.20.
