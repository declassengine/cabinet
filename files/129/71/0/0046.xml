(54) 34615th November, 1954CABINETRATIFICATION OF THE SOUTH-EAST ASIA collective defence treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty was signed at Manila on 8th September by Lord Reading in accordance with the authority given by theCabinet on 27th August (C.C. (54) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2). On16th November, the Treaty will have been before Parliament for the customaryperiod of 21 sitting days. It was expressly approved by the House of commons on 8th November, and although it was mildly criticised in a debate in the Houseof Lords on 10th November there was no suggestion that ratification should be withheld. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will accordingly be able to ratify this Treatyat any time after 16th November.2. So far only Siam has ratified. President Eisenhower has sent the treaty to the Senate with a request for early ratification. Pakistani intentions areuncertain, but the remaining signatories to the Treaty can probably ratify beforethe end of the year. If my colleagues agree, I propose to defer ratification by theUnited Kingdom until the United States is in a position to ratify. I have suggested to the remaining signatories, except Siam, that they should also ratify at the sametime as the United Kingdom and the United States.A.
