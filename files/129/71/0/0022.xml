SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 32225th October, 1954CABINETROYAL COMMISSION ON SCOTTISH affairs memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, in announcing the publication of theReport of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs (Cmd. 9212) on 27th July,said, as proposed in C. (54) 233, that the recommendations in the report wouldhave immediate consideration. With the resumption of Parliament, there isalready pressure for an early statement on the Governments attitude to the report.2. The Commission were asked &quot; to review with reference to the financial,economic, administrative and other considerations involved, the arrangements forexercising the functions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to Scotland,and to report.&quot; The Commission endorsed in general the present arrangementsfor the administration of Scottish affairs and did not recommend any substantialdeparture from the principles on which Ministerial responsibility has been assignedfor particular subjects, or from the existing departmental arrangements. TheCommission did, however, make three specific recommendations affectingMinisterial responsibility, and also made a number of proposals affectingdepartmental practice. After consultation with the Ministers directly affected weinvite our colleagues to agree that the Government should accept the Commission^recommendations in principle and should authorise an early statement inParliament to this effect. A draft statement is appended. The main recommendations are discussed in more detail below.Roads3. The Commission recommended that the responsibility for roads inScotland, including the construction, maintenance and classification of highways,should be transferred from the Minister of Transport to the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. In support of this they observed that, while roads serve the country as a whole, local requirements are of predominant importance, at any rate in thecase of those in the lower classifications; that the Minister who is most likely to be aware of local requirements in Scotland the Secretary of State should, therefore,be responsible for Government policy in relation to roads; that the Secretary ofState is likely to be better informed than the Minister of Transport can be in regardto the repercussions of road policy on the local economy of Scotland; that scottish local authorities are accustomed to consult the Secretary of State on a wide variety of topics, and that it should be more acceptable to and convenient forthem if they were able to consult him on highway matters; and that, since theSecretary of State is already responsible for the provision of most of the basicservices in the Highlands and Islands, it seems unbusinesslike and inconvenientthat highways should, as at present, form the single important exception to that rule.4. The proposed reorganisation will require rather more staff than the present arrangement; the segregation of small technical staffs in Scotland will presentproblems, though efforts will be made to minimise the ill-effects by transfers ofstaff between the English and Scottish Departments; and there will be strong47026Printed for the Cabinet.

pressure for higher Government expenditure on Scottish roads, though obviouslythe Government would be reluctant to agree that the reorganisation in itself couldbe a reason for higher expenditure on the roads of Great Britain as a whole.The existence of the Road Fund, covering Great Britain, also presentscomplications. None of these difficulties is, however, insuperable; and theMinister of Transport accepts the view that effect should be given to the RoyalCommission^ recommendation, subject to a possible exception in regard to the supervision of the collection of motor vehicle duties. Detailed arrangements willhave to be worked out between the Departments concerned. The most convenientdate for making the transfer may be 1st April, 1956.Justices of the Peace5. The Commission recommended that the present responsibilities of theLord Chancellor for Justices of the Peace in Scotland should be transferred to theSecretary of State for Scotland; and the Lord Chancellor, after discussion with theSecretary of State, does not wish to object.Animal Health6. The Commission recommended that the responsibility for theadministration in Scotland of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1950, and other legislation dealing with animal health should be transferred from the Minister ofAgriculture to the Secretary of State. They made the recommendation primarily to correct the position whereby the Secretary of State, while responsible for every other aspect of Scottish agriculture in which animal husbandry plays a leading part,has no control over, nor Parliamentary responsibility for, animal healthadministration. . They pointed out that the anomaly is emphasised as veterinaryeducation and research fall within the Secretary of State&apos;s jurisdiction and hearranges for the provision of veterinary services in the Highland counties.7. The Minister of Agriculture, while he thinks that there may be criticism on technical grounds, agrees that, subject to the special arrangements described below in respect of epidemic diseases, the responsibility for animal health anddisease in Scotland should be vested in the Secretary of State. It is proposed toprovide accordingly and to arrange for common action by the two Ministers where appropriate. The special arrangements will apply to the control of epidemicdiseases, e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever, and fowl pest. Thearrangements for the control of foot-and-mouth disease were recently examined by the Gowers Committee, who, in view of the movement of animals constantlytaking place across the Border and the vital need for prompt action on uniformlines, strongly recommended that the present system of unified control should bemaintained. Taking that view into account it is proposed that control of generalpolicy in regard to epidemic diseases would be exercised, and statutory ordersconcerned with that policy made, by the two Ministers acting jointly; and operational control of epidemic diseases throughout Great Britain would continueto be under the Minister of Agriculture and to be administered by the Ministry&apos;sAnimal Health Division. The existing veterinary service would continue to bemaintained on a Great Britain basis and would act under the Secretary of State inrelation to transferred matters in Scotland.Agricultural Research8. The agricultural research institutes in Scotland are at present financed from the Vote of the Department of Agriculture. The Agricultural research council have proposed that all funds for agricultural research in Great britain should be concentrated in one central fund, namely, the CounciTs grant in aid.The Royal Commission decided not to support this proposal and recommendedno change, whereas the Estimates Committee (Fifth Report of 1953-54) were evidently sympathetic to it. There seems thus to be some conflict between theviews of the Royal Commission and the Estimates Committee. Departments arediscussing arrangements under which there would be improvements in the machineryfor co-ordinating broad questions of research policy and the broad allocation of funds between the Agricultural Research Council and the agricultural departments. It is not necessary to seek a decision by Ministers on this subject at this stage or to refer to it in the proposed statement on the Royal Commission&apos;srecommendations.
Departmental Practice9. The Commission made a number of recommendations designed to improveadministration in Scotland, especially by measures designed to increase the amountof Scottish business which various Great Britain Departments can transact inScotland. Most of these recommendations can be accepted by Departments andtheir detailed implementation, either as they stand or subject to modification, will now be considered by Departments in consultation with the Treasury.Machinery to Implement Decisions10. The transfer to the Secretary of State of functions relating to animal health could be effected by Order-in-Council under the Ministers of the Crown(Transfer of Functions) Act, 1946. The same is true of the functions relating toroads, though the position is complicated by the desirability of legislating on thesubject of the Road Fund. The Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Functions)Act may also be sufficiently wide to cover the transfer of the functions relating toJustices, but other considerations may make it desirable in practice to deal withthis matter by legislation. In these circumstances it would not seem to be desirableto include in the statement of the Government^ intention any promise of legislationnext year.Conclusion11.   We invite our colleagues (a) to   agree  that  the   Government  should   accept  the  Commission^recommendations subject to the minor exceptions indicated above; and(b) to approve the attached draft statement to be made in Parliament.R. A. B.J. S.22nd October, 1954.appendix draft statement i should like, with permission, to make a statement on the conclusions whichthe Government has reached on the principal recommendations in the report of theRoyal Commission on Scottish Affairs.The Commission was charged with the duty of reviewing the arrangementsfor the exercise of the functions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to scotland and, after careful examination, the Commission, in general, has endorsed the existing arrangements.The Commission proposed, however, that the responsibilities of the Ministerof Transport and Civil Aviation in Scotland for roads, piers and ferries, theresponsibility of the Lord Chancellor for the appointment of Justices of the Peace,and the responsibilities of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries for animal health, should all be transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland. TheGovernment accepts these proposals and at the appropriate time will ask parliament to approve them. The only qualification I need mention is that, for reasons given in the recent report of the Departmental Committee on Foot andMouth Disease, the Minister of Agriculture will remain responsible for the operational control of epidemic diseases among animals throughout Great Britain.The control of policy in regard to such diseases will be exercised by the Secretary ofState and the Minister, acting jointly.The Commission made a number of recommendations of an administrativecharacter, designed inter alia to increase the amount of Scottish business which theUnited Kingdom and Great Britain Departments can settle in Scotland. TheGovernment is in full accord with the objectives of the Commission and hopes tobe able to give effect to most of their detailed recommendations.
