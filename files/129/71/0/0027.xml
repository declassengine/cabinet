Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1.954SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 32728th October, 1954CABINETANGLO-CANADIAN relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsFor three and a half weeks my wife and I have been the guests of the canadian government.2. Though I had been in Canada several times during and after the war1 had not been across the country since 1932; and the Canadian Prime Ministerwanted me to see as much as possible in the time. I had two days in Ottawa atthe start and four days near the end. During the rest of my time I stayed inEdmonton, Vancouver, Victoria, Banff, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Quebec andMontreal.3. In Ottawa I had talks with a number of Federal Ministers, a record ofwhich I append. In all the other cities I talked with Provincial Ministers, Mayors,leading industrialists and owners and editors of newspapers and saw the TradeCommissioners and their staffs. In every city I spoke to large gatherings, usuallyarranged by the Canadian Clubs. Nearly all these speeches were broadcast, andin addition I was interviewed three times on television. As we moved from place to place I recorded my impressions of the tour; I am circulating separately someof these impressions which will be of interest to my colleagues.4.   I can summarise my main impressions briefly as follows:  (i) I could not have had a warmer welcome. Everywhere people were notonly generous in their hospitality, but they talked with the frankness of friends.(ii) The friendliness of the average Canadian is matched by his ignoranceabout Great Britain; this is particularly true of the younger generation. The storyI had to tell about British recovery and the efficiency and inventiveness of Britishindustry was as novel as it was agreeable to most of my hearers. The Chairmanof the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation told me that he had had letters fromall over Canada saying how much they had appreciated having had the speechesbroadcast. Even in Montreal a Senator said to his neighbour at luncheon: &quot; Ishall be interested to hear what he has to say. I think the old country is in prettypoor shape.&quot; After luncheon: &quot;I never knew that; I recast a lot of my thinkingwhile he was speaking.&quot;(iii) I found, particularly in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, a growing appreciation of the value of the United Kingdom market and the consequent importance of reciprocal trade. Two Prairie Provinces have &quot; BuyBritish &quot; weeks. Primary producers resent the restrictions which are imposed ontheir exports to the United States, often suddenly and without notice. In speeches and in conversation I stressed the increasing liberalisation we were giving to canadian imports in spite of the dollar gap, and the fact that, given something approaching equilibrium, Canadian exports could increase steadily, as we arenatural reciprocal markets.(iv) There appears to be no limit to Canadian resources and development.There are not only enormous iron-ore deposits in Quebec and Labrador, but thewhole economy of the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia is being transformed.Oil, natural gas, minerals have been added to the vast grain areas of the Prairies;and in minerals they have, as it were, only scratched the surface.47043 bST-&apos;
(v) The American pull in trade is formidable and constant. Canada will nevergo American in a political sense. Every Canadian, old and new, is first and last Canadian. But American technique, American capital, American goods so easilyavailable, American advertising, American magazines and American visitors all have a profound effect on Canadian habits, Canadian business and Canadianbuying in spite of the large adverse trade: balance.(vi) I should, however, record several factors which help us. First, thereis the Dollar Exports Council. Secondly, there is the close contact betweenCanadian research institutions and our Own, not   only in pooling information butalso in the interchange of personnel at all grades^ Thirdly, there is the presenceof Canadian students in our Universities and ours in theirs. The more of this the better.(vii) What I have said is not intended to be a reflection on British firms. BothCanadian Ministers and business men told me that our bigger firms were goodin their representation and their study of the market. But it is always uphill work,though the help British trade is getting from the Dollar Exports Council andJames Duncan&apos;s Dollar Sterling Trade Council is of the highest value.(viii) We have a tremendous opportunity. There is no horizon to Canada&apos;resources and development. It is the biggest prize in the long run commerciallyand politically. But we shall not win that prize unless we can bring home tomillions of Canadians that mutual trade is as much their interest as ours. Todo that we have got to &quot; sell Britain &quot; day by day. How can the British Governmenthelp in this ?(a) We can encourage manufacturers by seeing they have enough dollars fora personal study of the market and to be well represented and toestablish their own selling organisations. The more British capital invested in Canada, the better. I know all this has much improved inthe last year or two.(b) Our Trade Commissioner Service must be the best we can provide. Thereare some good men in it to-day, and all I saw were keen. But the topmen should be men who can talk with Ministers, Federal and provincial, and with leading business men with confidence and authority.(c) We should arrange for visits by Ministers and other men and women who can talk well on British life and on what Britain is and is doingnot only in industry but in every field.(d) We should have in the key cities first-class Public Relations Officers who can be on intimate terms with the Press, radio and television. Theymust put over their stuff largely as news, and their aim should be tocreate an atmosphere in which Canadians want to know more andmore about Britain. I am convinced this is as important as the trade commissioner Service, with whom the Public Relations Officers should work closely.We are fortunate in our High Commissioner, who is known, liked andrespected all over Canada. He will direct the effort well; but he must havethe necessary staff and the right staff.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,26th October, 1954.

APPENDIXOttawa, 18th October, 1954.I had an hour&apos;s talk with Mr. Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs,this morning in which we covered a wide field.2. Cyprus-On Cyprus I said that Mr. Pearson knew the importance weattached to this, that we had much appreciated Canada having voted with us and we hoped that he would help us still further in trying to turn votes the rightway. Mr. Pearson said Canada would do all they could but we must let him playthe hand with other countries in his own way. He had been a bit handicapped by the Canadian Prime Minister^ declaration three years ago that the U.N.O.Assembly ought to be able to discuss anything. The vote which Canada had given against inscribing Cyprus was given in the teeth of that declaration andthe Canadian Government would have some criticism in Parliament; but they were set on their course and they would meet that criticism all right.3. Mr. Pearson then asked me what was the attitude we wanted the assembly to adopt. I said we believed that the present Greek plan was to work for a&quot; benign &quot; resolution. Such a resolution would be in some ways worse than theoriginal Greek proposal for a United Nations plebiscite in Cyprus, because itwould tend to obscure the fact that the passing of any resolution, except oneclosing discussion, would constitute intervention of the United Nations and would recognise Greece as a party to a dispute with the United Kingdom over Cyprus.Mr. Pearson said he thought that was good sense, that he agreed and would follow that line. He said our talk was very opportune as the Greek Minister was coming to see him later that day. Mr. Pearson said that he would try to be at the Assemblyhimself when Cyprus came up.4. S.E.A.T.O.-On S.E.A.T.O. I told him that Australia had decided tomake no reservation. This was news to him and he said it was most satisfactory.He was critical of Foster Dulles for insisting on the American reservation.5. I asked Mr. Pearson whether he had had any talk with the PakistanPrime Minister, whom he had met in London, about the Pakistan attitude. Hesaid &quot; No.&quot; I said that both Mr. Eden and I had spoken to Mohammed Aliabout this as I had heard that Mohammed Ali was now doubtful about Pakistanratification. I hoped we had turned him, but I had found Mohammed Ali a ratherharassed man and clearly not as much in control of his Cabinet as he had beenwhen I was in Pakistan before Christmas and before his recent ill-judgedmanoeuvres. Mr. Pearson said it would be very bad if Pakistan did not ratify.He said it would surely be mad for Pakistan to take this line when they were trying to get a lot of United States aid. I said that this was just what I had toldMohammed Ali in London. Mr. Pearson asked me to speak to Mr. St. Laurentabout this as he himself was leaving for Europe to-morrow and would not bein Ottawa during Mohammed Ali&apos;s visit.6. Kashmir. I told Mr. Pearson the position about Kashmir, most of whichhe knew pretty well. I said that it was very important when this came up thatthe Security Council should pronounce definitely on Graham&apos;s outstandingrecommendations and not let the thing be thrown at large into the Assembly.We had been throughout in close touch with Zafrullah and Pakistan would playthe hand this way and we should support fully. Mr. Pearson said that canada would do the same and again he hoped he might be present when thiscame up. He hoped very much that Zafrullah would remain throughout theAssembly to handle the Pakistan case and would not leave to take up hisInternational Judgeship.7. Mr. Pearson told me how Zafrullah came to be elected. The voting wasvery close. Canada like us had supported the Indian. When the final vote wastaken, the Israelite, who would certainly have voted against Pakistan, wasprecluded from casting a vote as it was some Jewish festival and so Zafrullah gotin by a majority of one.8. Indo-China. I expressed great appreciation of all the work Canada was doing on the Indo-China Commissions. It seemed to me that much would turnon having such a good Canadian team. Mr. Pearson said that they had stretchedthemselves to the limit.   Brigadier Lett, who is the senior officer, is first class and47043
they had to find 120 officers, largely soldiers, and competent soldiers at that.Canada would keep us closely informed about all that passed and any confidential information they had. Mr. Pearson confirmed that the Laos situation with the communists was very difficult in the North. On the Commission the Poles were apparently co-operative, but they knew exactly what they wanted and they wouldstop co-operating when it did not suit them. The Indians were anxious not to taketoo strong a line and this put a lot of responsibility on the Canadians. I saidagain we must all be profoundly thankful that they were there in such good force.9. Germany and N.A.T.O.-M.X. Pearson said he thought things were goingpretty well. He spoke very highly of Sir Frank Roberts and said he thoughtWilgress was also doing a good job, but they were working to a very narrow time-table. Mr. Pearson thought we could not settle every detail and he hoped wewould get all that really mattered in the formal agreements and that some detailscould be left over until the organisations were established and at work. Tiresomematters of detail would then smooth themselves out. Mr. Pearson was obviouslyvery anxious lest M. Mendes-France should accept the agreements but say that hecould not get them ratified by his Parliament until the Saar question was settled.Dr. Adenauer had been: extremely helpful and had gone as far as he could. I said I wondered if the Saar question was not in fact simplified by the establishmentof the European Coal and Steel Organisation. Mr. Pearson was inclined to agreebut M. Mendes-France was keenly interested in building up a strong economicFrance and he might be overplaying his hand to get- this.10.   Obviously working with Mr. Eden was one of his happiest experiences.11. Mr. Pearson then talked about all our interchange of information. Hesaid that this was first class and that they felt in Canada that they were not onlygetting everything but that we were appraising so much of the informationtogether. On their part they wanted us to feel (as indeed we do) that they are doing the same by us and that they are treating us as if we were one with them.Mr. Pearson said that they were giving us a great deal more information than theygave to any other Commonwealth country and indeed a good deal more than theygave to some of their own High Commissioners. They felt that our contact withall the Commonwealth countries was so close that they got everything from us;and that it was easier for us to differentiate in the information we gave to different countries than it would be for them.12. Altogether, one of the most satisfactory and agreeable hours I have spent.Ottawa, 18th October, 1954.I had a good talk with Mr. Howe, Minister of Trade and Commerce and ofDefence Production. He said that he appreciated we could not do convertibilitybut he hoped we could liberalise our trade still more. I said that we wanted to do all we could and we had gone a very long way, particularly in view of the adversetrade balance. The only thing that could stop us was lack of dollars and it was toour mutual advantage to try and reduce the dollar gap. Mr. Howe was a bitinclined to take the line that Canada was a free trade country and that 15 million people could not buy as much as 50 million, to which I replied that the 15 couldtransfer something of what they bought from the United States where the balancewas the wrong way. I think in practice Mr. Howe is better than his forceful faith in free trade. I asked him whether our manufacturers were doing their best in theirselling organisations here. He said &quot; Yes &quot; and that he thought now the big firmshad little to improve.2. He had one grouse on a subject with which I was hot familiar. He saidthat we had given the West Indies leave to spend an increased amount of dollarsbut we had said they must spend only 7 per cent, on motor cars. That was the kindof thing that irritated the Canadian people, by which he meant his Canadianmanufacturers. Mr. Howe said that there was always an undercurrent of feeling against the preferences they gave us where we gave them no preferences in return.I said that in fact we were a tremendous market for Canadian food and rawmaterials and that it was our unfettered purchases which created the big balance in their favour. They would never find us putting on sudden restrictions as theUnited States did unless we were compelled to do so by an acute dollar shortage.
Mr. Howe then said that this was pretty well realised. Certainly I had found thiswas so in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia. Mr, Howe added that we need not worry about the preferences. They were not going to reduce these.3. I asked Mr. Howe about unemployment. He said it was not serious,though of course manufacturers and workmen contrasted it with the full or overfullemployment they had been enjoying. He expected the position to improve.4. I asked Mr. Howe how the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) discussions had gone. He said he was pretty well satisfied with these,that &quot; the Australians and New Zealanders had been as tiresome as usual&quot; butthat he thought we should probably be a united team when we went into action.He told me he had had some talk with President Eisenhower, who hoped to getratification by Congress next year and to get a good deal more freedom in tariffnegotiation. Mr. Howe said that he thought the G.A.T.T. Session would be apretty sticky one but we should probably emerge with some sort of agreement allround, and that this would include setting up some body, which could be incontinuous session, and in which the countries could negotiate moderatere-arrangements of tariffs without raising the whole issue in a full meeting. Igathered that he thought our Japanese proposals fairly satisfactory.5. I asked Mr. Howe whether it would be useful to re-open discussions onthe Civil Aviation Agreement. He said &quot; No let it slide for the time being.&quot; Hewas enthusiastic about the Viscount.6. I asked Mr. Howe about the request by the American company toestablish a new cable service to the United Kingdom. I said I hoped the G.P.O.was now in full touch and agreement with the Canadians. Mr. Howe said hethought that was all right. If we wanted another service he supposed we had betterhave it. I said I did not think we wanted that at all. The only thing that was likely to influence us was the suggestion that another circuit was necessary for strategic purposes. Mr. Howe said he had not known about that. I said we would want to be very sure that this was really necessary as I was inclined to suspect thatthe American company was over-stressing defence to get a commercial advantage.Mr. Howe said that that was entirely his opinion, that this was a competition between the two big American companies and one wanted now to catch up withthe other. It is obviously very important that we should play this hand with canada.7. Mr. Howe dominates the whole economic field in Canada as much as ever.I find him all right to deal with as he barks at me with a friendly frankness whichwe have employed to one another for a good many years.Ottawa, 18th October, 1954.My final interview of the morning was with Mr. Harris, the new Minister ofFinance.2. Mr. Harris said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had dominatedthe finance talks and the Chancellor had obviously impressed Mr. Harris verymuch. Mr. Harris said he found himself a bit handicapped because his peoplehad told him that the Chancellor was going a good deal further on convertibilityand that it was only after Sir Frank Lee had been in Ottawa that they began tohave doubts. I said I hoped we had kept them informed on our thinking andMr. Harris said he had no complaint on that score. I gathered that his own people had gone on with their own wishful thinking. Mr. Harris said that in theend he had felt himself that we were wise not to rush things.3. Mr. Harris then went on to talk about the United States. He gave mea new forecast of the future, which no One else had done. Mr. Harris said that,though he agreed with other people that probably there would be a DemocraticCongress, he doubted whether this would be nearly as liberal and free trade in itsoutlook as the President and the State Department expected. He thought thata number of Democrats who might be elected for Northern constituencies wouldbe protectionists in their outlook and that the result might be that, on the tariffside, the President might have nearly as difficult a Congress to deal with as, atpresent. This is not Mr. PearsOn&apos;s view and Mr; Howe is perhaps mid-way betweenin his guess. ,&apos; &quot;
Ottawa, 18th October, 1954.I had had a long talk with the Prime Minister on my arrival, and to-day Italked with him again. I told the Prime Minister that we had been giving a gooddeal of consideration at home to the situation which would arise when the gold coast and later other Colonial territories attained full self-government. The gold coast would probably, be the first and this was not likely to happen for three years.But we felt we should be looking ahead and that we should have the opportunityof informal talks with some of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers.2. It rested with the United Kingdom Government to decide the time andpace of advance, but when a new country attained what we used to call &quot; fullDominion Status &quot; that country would almost certainly ask to be accepted as afull sovereign Member of the Commonwealth. That decision, of course, rested with all the other full Members. It had generally been assumed that full commonwealth status within the Commonwealth would be accorded.3. We had considered whether anything in the nature of a two-tier system was practicable. For all the reasons I detailed to Mr. St. Laurent, we at homewere inclined to think that this would be impossible and if it were attempted itwould probably lead to a country which was anxious to remain within theCommonwealth seceding. We therefore felt that full Commonwealth status wasthe only solution. This would not prevent our dealing differently on a numberof matters with new Members. As the Prime Minister was aware, there were already matters on which we and the old Commonwealth countries exchangedcomplete information and ideas, which were not so fully shared with others. ThePrime Minister said that he felt sure the conclusion we had come to was right.He also felt that when the time came this line would be entirely consistent with canadian thinking.4. The Prime Minister said he assumed the difficulty would arise with SouthAfrica, and he asked me what position I thought they would take. In my earlierconversation I had told the Prime Minister that we were expecting Dr. Malamto announce his resignation and that we very much hoped Mr. Havenga wouldbe his successor. Dr. Malan&apos;s announcement came while I was on tour. I saidthat I thought South Africa would probably accept the position if all the other commonwealth countries did. They would not like it, but rather than go out ofthe Commonwealth my guess was South Africa would take it. I did not thinkSouth Africa wanted to be isolated. I had told the Prime Minister in our previoustalk of our dbfence discussions with South Africa and the remarkable advancethey had made about the ports and about defence, generally. We were also closetogether on economic questions. If the issue should come up while Mr. Havengawas Prime Minister the probability of things going right would be greater.4. Mr. Harris told me that Mr. Abbott, the former Minister of Finance,had known M. Mendes-France well as he had come regularly to meetings of theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr. Abbott said thatM. Mendes-France had always cared much more about the economic side and building an economic French Empire than he had been about anything else. Thisis interesting as confirming Dr. Adenauer&apos;s view.5. Mr. Harris said the Colombo meetings had gone well. He had started by wanting to cut his Colombo contribution but he found that Colombo had considerable popularity in Canada as an altruistic exercise. Incidentally theirengineering contribution is quite helpful to their unemployment at the present time.Mr. Harris said he thought there was a lot of waste. He gave as an example that canada had supplied equipment for a dam and that they had found that this waslying unused after six months. I told Mr. Harris about the appointment of theman from Lahore to go round and see that the Colombo countries were orderingthe right equipment for their university and technical training. Mr. Harris thought this might well be extended to making sure that all contributions were properlytimed and used. Mr. Harris said that hitherto the Canadian contribution had been entirely to Commonwealth countries. He thought they would now have to extend this a bit, e.g., to Burma and possibly to Indonesia, though he rightly felt Indonesiaa pretty bad bet.6. After a rather slow start I got on well with Mr. Harris, who is obviouslyshrewd and certainly knows his Canada.
5. The Prime Minister then spoke to me about the office of Governor-General. He said that when Lord Alexander retired he had felt that it would be good to have a Canadian Governor-General, particularly as Mr. Massey was anideal man. It was good to do this in order to show that the meaning and tradition of the Crown and the Crown&apos;s Representative was as much Canadian as British.This did not necessarily create a precedent. Indeed, the Prime Minister said itwould probably be a good thing to ring the changes.6. The Prime Minister then told me about his plans for the Senate.Hitherto, the Senate had been regarded as a reward for political services.It had become too much a Party institution and a single Party at that,and the Senate had lost in influence and prestige. He had deliberately left a number of vacancies unfilled and now there were twenty vacancies to fill. he therefore proposed to fill ten of those vacancies by appointing men of distinguishedacademic attainments and to fill the other ten seats by political nominations. Igathered from what the Prime Minister said that at the moment this was knownonly to his Cabinet, so it should be treated with great confidence until he makes hisappointments.7. The Prime Minister then spoke to me about Mohammed Ali. He had told me before of the embarrassment of Mohammed Ali proposing to take a secondwife who was a Canadian citizen. The Prime Minister said that he thought thiswas a terrible mistake on Mohammed Ali&apos;s part. No doubt under Muslim law aman was entitled to have four wives, but not only had Mohammed Ali got acharming and able wife, who had made an equally good impression in his own country and in Canada, but he felt sure that this would be very ill-regarded inhis own country where women were attaining a new status. I understand that thelady who had travelled with Mohammed Ali as his secretary to England and theUnited States would now domicile herself for two months in Edmonton. after that we should see.Ottawa, 18th October, 1954.I had a talk with Mr. Pickersgill, who is the new Minister of Immigration.Mr. Pickersgill said that he hoped the temporary unemployment in Canada wouldnot hold up emigration. Certainly it would not hold up British emigration. any british citizen was welcome who would take his chance here and they were gladwhen a man was settled that he should bring out his family. He emphasised that unless a man came out to special assured employment he would have to take hischance and he could not necessarily find the trade he wanted.2. This year about 28 per cent, of the Canadian immigrants had been British.Mr. Pickersgill was not in favour of subsidised emigration. They had theirassisted-passage scheme, which he told me was in practice largely for Britishemigrants, but the emigrant had to repay his passage money. Generally he wasnot keen on any kind of subsidy because he thought the man who wanted to comewould probably manage his own passage.3. Mr. Pickersgill told me confidentially that he would very much like tointroduce a scheme of assisted scholarships to enable United Kingdom students toattend Canadian Universities. He had not yet tried this on his Cabinet. I saidI liked this idea enormously. We had got the Athlone Fellowships, which were first class, but the more there could be an interchange at the undergraduate levelthe better. I had been delighted to find a number of British undergraduates inVancouver. I asked Mr. Pickersgill whether it would embarrass him if, without inany way referring to his ideas, I said in some speech at home that I thought a two-way traffic at the university level was of great value, referred to the AthloneFellowship and referred to British undergraduates in Canada and said that themore this could happen between us the better. Mr. Pickersgill said he would like this very much.Ottawa, 19th October, 1954.I had a talk this morning with Mr. Campney, the Minister of Defence. Hehad been very pleased with his talks in England and delighted with his visit toGermany. He said he had found the Canadian troops in tremendously good heart.
The test had come on the manoeuvres in which they had a week of the worstpossible weather. They had stood up to this Very Well, had hardly any sickness and not a single case of pneumonia. He said the morale of both the Brigade group and the Air Force was very high and that the men were very happy. They were doing a lot for their families and children. They had got schools and werestarting more, and in this the Germans had been very co-operative.2. Mr. Campney then went on to talk about co-operation between theServices. He said that in Canada this was getting better all the time. The services were now thoroughly integrated. The Navy, who had been the least willing toplay, had now accepted the combined training and in all their Colleges all three services worked together with Commandants of the Schools drawn from theServices indiscriminately. He found that his Chiefs of Staff worked well together and all the better because the co-operation was getting better all the time at all levels. He liked the Canadian system under which there was a single Minister ofDefence with his Deputy, neither of them having an association with a singleService. In fact, throughout his Ministry the divisions were functional andnot Service and this was working very well.
