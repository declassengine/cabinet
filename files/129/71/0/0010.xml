Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954SECRETC. (54) 31014th October, 1954CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1954-55 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Cabinet, on 28th July, reached certain conclusions on next Session&apos;programme (C.C. (54) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5). The purpose of thismemorandum is to enable my colleagues to review the position.Bills included in the programme . The Cabinet approved the inclusion in the programme of the essentialBills included in List A&quot;of C. (54) 246, and such of those in List B as might in due course prove to be necessary. The following Bills must, in consequence, now beregarded as having a definite place in the programme:  Army and Air Force (3 or 4 Bills).British Transport Commission (Borrowing).Colonial Development and Welfare.Expiring Laws Continuance.Housing (Temporary Accommodation) [Economy Bill).Isle of Man (Customs).New Towns (Money).Northern Ireland: Governors Emoluments.Pakistan - (Consequential Provision).Pensions and National Insurance.Public Works Loans.Rating and Valuation.Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage (Amendment) (Economy Bill).South Lancashire Criminal Courts.Sugar Industry (Hybrid).Teachers&apos; Superannuation.Scottish Bill.Herring Industry.Fuller particulars of these proposed measures are set out in Appendix I tothis memorandum.Bills recognised to have strong claims to inclusion in the programme. The Cabinet also recognised, though without final commitment, thatcertain other Bills, although not essential, had strong claims to inclusion in theprogramme. In certain cases they specifically authorised the Ministers concerned to arrange for the preparation of such Bills; in other cases drafting has been authorised subsequently. The Bills in this category are as follows:  Dentists.National Service.Oil Pollution.Requisitioned Houses.Road Traffic.Rural Roads.Tube Shelters (Hybrid).Scottish Bills.Crofters.Food and Drugs.Fuller particulars of these proposed measures are set out in Appendix II to thismemorandum.Copy No.846966b
4. The inclusion of the Scottish Food and Drugs Bill in this list is on theassumption that the English Bill will be passed this session. If this should nothappen, the future of both Bills will have to be considered afresh.Time likely to be available for legislation. I have previously drawn attention to the vital need to relax in the next session Parliamentary pressure upon Government supporters so far as this ispossible on the basis of the Government^ present narrow majority. I considerthat the following is the minimum provision for recesses which should be madein the next Session:  Christmas From Wednesday, 22nd December to Tuesday,        One   month   less18th January. &quot; four days.Easter From Thursday, 7th April to Tuesday, 19th April.        11 clear days(usual).Whitsun From Friday, 27th May to Tuesday, 7th June.        10 clear days(usual).I suggest that it should be our aim to grant an additional week&apos;s recess at Whitsunif at all possible, in spite of the loss of five sitting days which this would involve.6. When allowance has been made for other categories of parliamentary business (Debate on the Address; Supply, and the Consolidated Fund andAppropriation Bills; Budget and Finance Bill; Private Members&apos; Bills and Motions;and a suitable margin for contingencies), but not for an additional week&apos;s recess atWhitsun, the maximum number of days upon which we can count for government legislation before the Summer Recess is 48.Size and Content of the programme. Calculations show that the Bills listed in paragraphs 2 and 3 above maywell occupy all the 48 days likely to be available for legislation. This would mean that there would be no margin available for emergency or unforeseen measures forwhich a need may arise. I understand that there is already a likelihood oflegislation being required as a result of the prospective European DefenceAgreements, and the Colonial Secretary has warned me of a possible need for minorlegislation in the Colonial sphere. I should emphasise here how helpful it wouldbe if the Finance Bill could be kept shorter than it has tended to be of late yearsand if the number of days to be devoted to the Bill in Committee could be reduced below eight.8. The principal measure of the Session will undoubtedly be the Bill dealingwith Pensions and Industrial Injuries. This Bill, together with the colonial development and Welfare Bill, will provide the programme with its necessaryelement of social welfare measures. The momentum of economic policy will doubtless be maintained through the Budget and Finance Bill, and the programme at present contains two small measures designed specifically to secure economies in Exchequer expenditure. The proposed Road Traffic Bill will rank as animportant measure of reform in a field in which there is deep and widespreadpublic interest. Finally, the special needs of Scotland and Wales will be recognised by the Crofters Bill and the proposed Bill on Rural Roads.9. It is hard to forecast the likely mood of the Opposition or the receptionwhich some of our measures will receive when they are presented to Parliament.The Chief Whip and I believe that the estimates which have been made of thetime which the various measures will take are reasonable, but we are working insome cases on the basis of titles of Bills only, and experience has shown how oftenit happens that the insertion of a single clause in a Bill can result in an otherwisestraightforward measure having a difficult passage in Parliament. We wouldlike the lists of Bills in paragraphs 2 and 3 above to be still further reduced, ifthis is possible. In any case we consider it to be essential that, before any particularmeasure is introduced, Ministers should consider most carefully how the Bill islikely to be received, particularly by our own supporters.
10. In this connection I must reluctantly assume that the need to pass the teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill in the next session cannot be avoided in view ofthe definite statement made in the House of Commons on 20th May that the bill will be carried through &quot; as soon as the pressure of the Parliamentary time-tablepermits and in any case before the end of the present financial year &quot; (official report, Col. 2297). There are, however, other Bills at present in the programme,whose political implications the Chief Whip and I would urge our colleagues toexamine most carefully. These are:  the Sugar Industry Bill;the two &quot; economy &quot; Bills listed in paragraph 2 above:  (a) to substitute Exchequer contributions to annual loan charges for capital grants at present payable under the Rural Water Supply and sewerage Acts;(b) to extend the period of amortisation under Section 8 (3) (b) of theHousing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, from 10 to 15years;the Requisitioned Houses Bill; andthe Rating and Valuation Bill.Bills to Enable Emergency Powers to be Dispensed With11. Under this heading the Cabinefs decisions were twofold. First, they agreed that the programme should include a Requisitioned Houses Bill but nO other legislation on land and water powers. Secondly, they invited the Home Secretaryto arrange for the drafting of a temporary Bill to continue Defence Regulation 55and associated regulations for certain specified purposes on the lines proposed inAppendix II to his memorandum, C. (54) 247.12. In C. (54) 311 the Home Secretary explains the reasons why he does not now recommend the introduction next session of a Bill to deal with defence regulation 55. At the same time he states the case for including in the programmecertain Bills to replace emergency powers in addition to three Bills of this kindincluded in the list in paragraph 3 above (Food and Drugs (Scotland),Requisitioned Houses and Tube Shelters (Hybrid)). Whilst I recognise the case for proceeding with this legislation when opportunity offers, it will be clear from. what I have said earlier that I do not consider that there will be time next session to carry through $8 the Bills which the Home Secretary has in mind for thispurpose as well as all the Bills listed in paragraph 2*, and that, if a choice has to be&quot;made between them, the Bills listed in paragraph $. have the stronger claim to priority.Other Bills13. If my colleagues adhere to the view that the Bills listed in paragraphs 2arid 3 above are those which should be brought forward, then it follows from the argument in this paper that there is no chance for any others at all. The only wayof making room is to drop something already approved.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W.1,14th October, 1954.46966
