MS&quot;,(THj0DCCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC Ma. JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 333 COPY NO. &quot;7 O6th November, 1954CABINETARMY AND AIR FORCE ACTS;REPORTS FROM THE SELECT committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for War andthe Secretary of State for AirFollowing difficulties which arose with the Opposition on theCommittee Stage of the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill in 1952, a select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed in May of thatyear &quot;to consider the Army Act and the Air Force Act and to make recommendations for the amendment thereof; and to consider and reporton the advisability of enacting the said Acts or parts thereof permanently&quot;.This Committee and its successors in the 1952/53 and present sessionshave submitted five reports, of which the final one, dated 20th July, 1954,contains in an Appendix draft Bills recommended for enactment in placeof the existing Army and Air Force Acts, and also deals with the question raised in the last part of their terms of reference.2.        Members of both Parties on the Select Committees have workedthroughout in the utmost harmony, and their reports are unanimous onalmost all points.    &quot;We are agreed that they have performed   a most valuable and necessary service in revising these Acts.    If their efforts are not to be wasted it is most important that the new Bills, with any necessary amendment, should be passed into law as soon as possible.They have been included in the programme of legislation for the coming session and, subject to early decisions by the Cabinet on a few major questions set out below, it is hoped to have them ready very shortly for examination by the Legislation Committee, with a view to their introduction early in the new session.3.        We need not trouble the Cabinet with most of the changes proposed.    Broadly speaking while there are a few things we do not like,we feel that there is nothing vital to which exception need be taken, andwe are in favour of accepting the whole of the recommendations in substance in the hope that the spirit of co-operation shown on the SelectCommittee will be continued in the House, and the Bills will have acomparatively easy passage.    If we propose major departures from theSelect Committee^ proposals, it will encourage others to do the same.If, however, our expectations are not fulfilled and controversial amendmentsare in fact put down by the Opposition, we wish to reserve the right to putdown Government amendments to the few clauses we would like to seealtered.4.        The matters to which we think it necessary to draw specificattention are in the Appendix.
We seek the Cabinefs decision on item (i)  (the number andpermanence of the new Acts), and we recommend their agreement to theproposals in (ii) to (iv) which relate to the death penalty for aiding theenemy or communicating with the enemy, mutiny and the application ofthe Acts to civilians.A.H.D.E.D.:5th November j 1954.APPENDIX(i) Number and Permanence of new ActsThe Committee recommend that there should continue to be aseparate comprehensive Act for each Service, covering the whole of thepresent field, and that these Acts should be renewable annually, but byOrder in Council after Resolutions of each House, for five years after which comprehensive new bills would be necessary.    These they recommend should be examined by another Select Committee unlessParliament otherwise decides at the time.    The appointment of such a select Committee is of course a matter for the House or Houses.    It isto be hoped that its proceedings would be largely formal.From the point of view of the Departments no reason is seen to object to the proposals.A short and uncontroversial third Bill will be necessary,common to both Services, to include necessary consequential amendments of other Acts, transitional provisions and savings.    The Select Committeerecognise this.(ii) Clauses 24 and 25.    Death penalty for aiding the enemy orcommunicating with the enemyThese clauses give effect to what was undoubtedly the intentionof Parliament in 1930, when the death penalty was abolished for cowardiceand desertion.    The effect is to exclude from the death penalty, and makeliable to imprisonment for life, some offences still capital under thepresent Act which might be committed through cowardice or othermotives not amounting to treachery, and to limit the death penalty to cases where intent to assist the enemy is proved.    Such intent might ofcourse be difficult to prove;  it would have to be inferred from the facts.Death sentences for military offences are very rare, and it isdoubtful whether these changes will make any difference in practice.
The Cabinet considered the Service Departments&apos; proposals on mutiny on 17th February, 1953, (C.C.(53) 12th Conclusions, Minute 3)when certain difficulties were raised by the Law Officers.    Later it wasagreed that the proposals might be placed before the Select Committeefor consideration as the preliminary conclusions of the Service authorities with the points made by the Law Officers clearly brought out, on the under1standing that the Government were not committed to acceptance(C.C.(53) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4).Under the existing Acts every offence of a mutinous nature,however trivial, carries the death penalty as the maximum punishment,and &quot;mutiny&quot; is undefined.    The Select Committee recommend thefollowing definition:-&quot;Mutiny&quot; means a combination between persons two at least of whom are subject to service law(a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority in Her Majesty&apos;s forces or any forces co-operating therewith or in any part of any of the saidforces;(b) to disobey such authority in such circumstances as to make thedisobedience subversive of discipline, or with the object of aoviding any duty or service against, or in connection with operations against, theenemy, or(c) to impede the performance of any duty or service in Her Majesty&apos;forces or in any forces co-operating therewith or in any part of any ofthe said forces.&quot;Service law&quot; means military law, the Naval Discipline Act or theAir Force Act.Attention is drawn to the words underlined.Under the Select Committee&apos;s proposals the death penalty formutiny will in future be limited to:-(a) taking part in a mutiny involving the use of violence orthreat of the use of violence, or having as an object the refusalor avoidance of any duty or service against, or in connectionwith operations against, the enemy, or the impeding of the performance of any such duty or service;(b) inciting any person subject to service law to take partin such a mutiny, whether actual or intended;(c) with intent to assist the enemy, failing to use utmostendeavours to suppress a mutiny which is known to betaking place or intended, or to report it without delay.Other offences will carry imprisonment for life.
1(2(iv)  Clause 211 and Fifth Schedule.    Application of Army andAir Force Acts to civiliansDifficulties have arisen in the past owing to the fact thatcivilians accompanying British forces in foreign countries are not subjectto military law except when the forces are oh active service.    This means that in peace-time such civilians who commit offences must either besent home for trial, which is usually impossible or very difficult, orleft to the mercies of foreign processes of law and punishment, or escapeany penalty.    It had therefore been proposed that power should be takenin the Army and Air Force Acts to try such civilians by court-martialfor civil offences and certain offences applicable to them, such as dis-obedience of standing orders,resistance to arrest, etc.     Other forces,e.g. American and French, already have such powers over their civiliansand they are necessary if we are to be able to exercise our jirior right of jurisdiction in certain cases under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationstatus and other international agreements.The Staff Side of the National Whitley Council, so far as crown servants are concerned, while disliking trial by court-martial, regard itas preferable to trial by local courts.    The Treasury have been associated with the discussions.The Select Committee have recommended that powers shouldbe taken, for use if necessary, and should include provision for the summarydisposal of minor offences by a fine not exceeding  10, with a right toopt for trial by court-martial.The Select Committee&apos;s proposals have not, so far as we are aware, aroused any unfavourable comment in the Press.
