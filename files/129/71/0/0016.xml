Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954SECRET Copy No.    g gC. (54) 31619th October, 1954CABINETTHE COMMONWEALTH DISCUSSIONS ON  THE  GENERALAGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADENote by the President of the Board of TradeI attach for information a note written by Sir Frank Lee, the permanent secretary of the Board of Trade, in his capacity as Chairman of the recent conference of Commonwealth representatives to discuss the Review of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).2. Sir Frank Lee&apos;s note indicates a welcome degree, of agreement on a great many issues, but makes it clear that on others further study and reference to ministers will be required before we can settle definitely what line is to be takenby the United Kingdom at the G.A.T.T. Review session beginning on 8th November. Arrangements are already in hand for the further study of thesequestions and for the preparation of submissions to Ministers: I will circulatethese to my colleagues as soon as they are ready. In the meantime I am taking up separately in C. (54) 314 the question of Japan (paragraph 3 (a) of the enclosed note) and am discussing with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the questionof what action we might take on the crucial issue of the proposed United Statescontinuous use of quantitative restrictions on agricultural produce.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,18th October, 1954.
SECRETCOMMONWEALTH DISCUSSIONS ON THE REVIEW OF THE G.A.T.T.4th-llth October, 1954Note by the Permanent Secretary, Board of Trade&apos; ;This note gives some broad personal impressions on these discussions and an indication of those questions on which further consideration of the UnitedKingdom proposals will be necessary as a result of the meeting. ,2.   Three main impressions have been left on my mind:-(a) This was an exchange of views only. Delegations were averse even tohaving an agreed record, and the achievement of a uniform Commonwealth line was out of the question. Delegations are now reporting to their Governments,and consequently no completely firm deductions can be made from the recent discussions, since Ministerial instructions for the Geneva Conference may differ from the line taken by officials in the talks. . ;,Nevertheless, a substantial degree of agreement emerged. It is true that atany given moment a stray visitor attending the discussions might have imaginedthat he was attending an organised meeting of protest against the G.A.T.T. Butin a meeting of this kind, discussion naturally tends to concentrate on points of criticism while the points approved are taken for granted. Although at intervalsthe Australian representative said that his Government would wish, to see what sort of G.A.T.T. emerged from the Review before deciding whether to continueto adhere to it, there is no doubt in my.mind that Commonwealth governments will in the event continue to support the G.A.T.T. and to regard it as being an indispensable long-term code of behaviour in trade matters and as an essentialcorollary of any move to freer payments and trade. There is not agreement aboutthe sort of G.A.T.T. Governments would like. Broadly speaking, the UnitedKingdom, Canada and South Africa stand for a tighter G.A.T.T., more strictly observed; the &quot; under-developed &quot; countries (India, Pakistan and Ceylon) want aG.A.T.T. where they have full rights but only minimal obligations; Australia wouldlike a, tighter G.A.T.T. in some, respects (e.g., export subsidies) but in: other important respects would be opposed to a tighter G.A.T.T. New Zealand issympathetic to Australia but will loyally follow us.It follows that nothing happened at the meeting which, in my view, radicallyaffects our own broad approach to the G.A.T.T. Review. We shall not get full commonwealth support for all our proposals, but there will, I think, be no reallycrucial point of difference.(b) All Commonwealth representatives especially those from Australia expressed very great concern about the danger to stability represented by mountingUnited States agricultural surpluses and the risk of their being dumped abroad. Toa substantial extent, this concern goes wider than the G.A.T.T. Review what is really feared and disliked is the whole operation of the United States price support arrangements, which directly leads to over-production and surpluses. So far asthe G.A.T.T. is concerned, this general concern affects (i) the provisions in regardto export subsidies (which all Commonwealth Governments agree should betightened as much as possible), and (ii) the likely effect of the United States decision that, for political reasons, they must maintain quantitative restrictions on agricultural commodities. From the standpoint of the United Kingdom, the point at (ii) is of capital significance since if this exception is admitted for a great creditornation it may be very difficult to refuse agreement to all sorts of other exceptionalarrangements involving the use of quantitative restrictions.There will be a concerted attack at Geneva on the American position and strong feelings will be expressed. This will be all to the good. The difficult problem will be to decide what to do if the Americans persist in saying that theymust&apos; have ah exception in respect of; quantitative restrictions for agricultural commodities especially as most Commonwealth delegations are less interested inthis particular difficulty than in making a general attack on the American pricesupport system. yti

(c) A special note is perhaps desirable on the position taken by the Australiandelegation. This tended to be characteristically violent in written papers and initialexpression, but much more moderate in the course of discussion. The broadposition appears to be that, with the passing of the sellers&apos; market for primary products and the threat of United States agricultural surpluses, Australia faces thefuture with an apprehension quite urik-noWif in, say, 1951 (when we vainly tried to persuade her to limit increases in wool prices). There is consequently a disposition to say that G.A.T.T. is -ill-balanced; that it favours highly industrialisednations against those largely dependent on primary products, and.that thisunbalance must be remedied. The general&apos; line appears to be. to expressdissatisfaCtiori with and1 attack everything in the hope that something will emergewhich will benefit Australia or Which can be represented as a political victory.But the bark is always worse than the bite, and I do not believe that Australia willeither leave or wreck the G.A.T.T., especially if they can get their way about export subsidies and- commodity arrangements.3l I will now summarise as briefly as I can the outcome of the discussions onthe main individual issues put before the meeting: -(a) Japan   .       .       -.&apos;   .      .,. ..   u iThere was a welcome degree of support for&quot; the United Kingdom proposalChat Article XXXV of the G.A.T.T. should be amended so as to make the entry of japan&apos;-conditional oh the conclusion by us and other countries of bilateral agreements&apos; containing- escape provisions against Japan. I have some doubt whether, in the event, the Canadians (who have tiresome moral scruples on this issue) Would support us if the United States did not. Otherwise, we shall havegeneral Commonwealth support, although it is possible that one or moreCommonwealth cduhtries-(especially South Africa) may apply Article XXXV in any event. : -.. -The question now is one of tactics vis-a-vis the United States arid Japari. Thisrriust be considered separately.(b) Quantitative Restrictions - ,,Leaving aside the problem posed by the American attitude on protection for agriculture, the broad&apos; position on the United Kingdom proposals as regardsquantitative restrictions&apos; was that no-one; except Canada and South Africa, was prepared tc go as far as us on the tight control of quantitative restrictions i.e., tobe imposed for strictly bona fide balance of payments purposes and subject to approval by the G.A.T:T. and to a time limit. The main objections stem from (i) adislike of the need to seek approval of the G.A.T.T., (ii)&apos; a1 deep-seated1 prejudiceagainst any. intervention by the International Monetary Fund, and (iii) a belief thatthe proposed time limit might operate hardly in the case of countries largely dependent on exports of primary products (the prices of which might be depressedfor a period of years).Ministers will presumably have to consider how far, in practice, we shall beprepared to&quot; modify our proposals at Geneva in the light of the criticisms-expressedof them. It is doubtful whether we could get them accepted in their presententirety, though this will largely depend on what happens about the United states attitude on protection for agriculture.(c) Pfieferenees-i.;., --. -,../        r.-;.;. lh       *.t r:r-:d     t.    i iu;   *--.v.:r. ;nThe discussion on this subject took an unexpected turn. The-Australianrepresentative led off; with a general attack, on the rigidity of the present rule. . he received, however, scarcely any support either for a frontal attack on the no-view-preference rule; or for.any general measures of adjustment (e.g.,,a revalorisation of specific (preference rates).. In a. second- statement, he. i virtually. disclaimed any intention on the part of Australia to raise; either&quot; a general attack on the no-new-preference rule or broad measure of adjustment&apos; such&quot; as the revalorisation of specificrates, and he said that (1) Australia did not want to increase preferences arid might in some cases wish to diminish them, arid (ii) that if stronger, provisioris could&apos;besecured on export subsidies much of Australian&apos; anxiety: under this head would disappear, -;-.vi.: ..;;v - ;-- w .-;;.&apos;. The general impression left on my mind is that.preferences! are regarded- bymost people.as no longer a really live issue particularly as they would really beno protection against the main anxiety expressed at the meeting the danger arisingfrom United States internal price support schemes and export subsidies.      ,
(d) Tariffs- [\ f.-.-./ v;:..;:;.: &quot;r&apos;;! .;f; :&apos;;rf\ &apos;4 :Ar/. A&quot;. ;. ..: The issue here is whether there should be a further, extension after the. summer of next year of the present time bar on the renegotiation of&apos;bound tariffs. the canadians pressed strongly for this (and indeed, urged that tariffs should be stabilised indefinitely, subject to some escape provisions) on the grounds that to throw bound&apos; tariffs open to renegotiation would encourage protectionist elements in the United States and Canada as well as in Other countries. Most other delegations, while paying lip service to stability of tariffs, insisted that they must be free to make adjustments of their tariffs in order to meet particular difficulties.No decision has as yet been taken as to what line the United Kingdom shouldtake on this subject. It will be necessary for an early submission to be made to ministers on the subject, and the preparation of this is in hand.(e) Export SubsidiesI have already indicated that all Commonwealth delegations agreed that theexisting provisions of the G.A.T.T. restricting the use of export subsidies shouldbe materially strengthened, because of their great fear of American surpluses andthe risks of widespread dumping. This is in accordance with our own policy; but itwill be necessary for further study to be made of the question of what precise formthe revised provisions should take. ..  , .   .The Australians pressed that, as a corollary to the inclusion of strengthened&apos;provisions in the G.A.T.T., importing. countries should be placed under ahobligation to impose countervailing duties in all circumstances against subsidisedexports. This proposal.met with scarcely any support:, we ourselves were at pains to point out that we should find it difficult to accept any such general obligationwhich might, e.g., preclude us from buying cheap American wheat at&quot; ourown discretion.(/) Commodity arrangements the. Australians pressed strongly that G.A.T.T. should be amended in orderto ensure that commodity arrangements should be conducted under its aegis: they also urged that the principles governing commodity, agreements should be lessrigidly stated than they were in&apos; Chapter 6 Of the Havana Charter.There&apos; is a good deal of illusion on this subject since&quot; (as was freely pointedout at the discussion) the formal placing Of commodity arrangements under the aegis of the G.A.T.T.. would not in fact of itself bring about the conclusion of any commodity.; agreements. That is a matter for negotiation on individual commodities (a field in which the Australians have hitherto been very slow to take action). But we ourselves think it right to.propose that commodity&apos;arrangements should be brought under the&apos;aegis of the G.A.T.T. rather than left (as they are atthe moment) in the hands of a Commission of ECOSOC (which can scarcely fail to be other than tiresome). Arid! we see relatively little difficulty about theAustralian suggestions concerning the principles governing commodity agreements.There may, however, be acute difficulty with the Americans on this subject, sinceCongress is very suspicious of any suggestion that the United States should participate again in general commodity arrangements like the InternationalMaterials Conference.(g) Position of the Underdeveloped CountriesRepresentatives of India, Pakistan and Ceylon argued that Article XVIII ofthe G.A.T.T. which, broadly speaking, gives underdeveloped countries a special&quot; let-out &quot; in respect of additional tariffs or quantitative restrictions designed toprotect development programmes should be substantially redrafted in such a way as would permit action by such countries virtually without question and in any circumstances. They agreed, however, that it would be desirable to seek a definition to ensure that Only bona fide underdeveloped countries were accordedsuch a right in the sure confidence that they themselves would be on the right sideof the demarcation line.This may well be a difficult problem. We are committed to agreeing thatunderdeveloped countries should have special rights, not available to ordinarymembers of the G.A.T.T., in order to enable them to concentrate resources on development. But we do not want this right to be pushed too far i.e., to aposition in which the underdeveloped countries had all the rights but none of theobligations of the G.A.T.T., particularly as. this is an issue on which United
Kingdom industry feels strongly. We shall have to give a good deal of further thought to the question of the re-drafting of Article XVIII in a form which; wouldgive the underdeveloped countries something without giving them the complete-licence for which they ostensibly ask.(h) The &quot;Special Problem of the colonies the recital of these problems met with a,very sympathetic response from alldelegations. There was general agreement that we should try to deal with theproblem by pressing for a suitable extension of Article XVIII of the G.A.T.T.,which would in effect give the United Kingdom the right to meet particularColonial needs by special arrangements in the United Kingdom market (quotas,preferences, subsidies, &amp;c.) which might not be permissible in the ordinary wayunder the G.A.T.T. The actual extent, to which we could use such powers inpractice would clearly depend on the circumstances of each individual case andthe right would be one-sided there could be no reciprocity on the part of theColony and the right could only be exercised in respect of Colonies which acceded to the G.A.T.T.&apos;:;A- provision on these lines should enable us to deal with some of the morepressing individual problems of the Colonies. Further study will have to be givento the exact form of the extension to Article XVIII.4. I have hot tried to deal with some of the other questions discussed(e.g., discrimination against a persistent creditor), in which the discussions gave riseto no question of principle or difficulty. It will be seen that we were at pains toarrange for full discussion of the four particular difficulties (particular preferences:the revalorisation of specific preferences: special problems of the Colonies: andan escape clause in relation to Japan) which the Chancellor mentioned in his speech at Blackpool on the 8th October.5. I might conclude this note by making some reference to the calibre and performance of the delegations. The United Kingdom gained considerable creditby our initiative in convening the meeting and our action in circulating fullmemoranda beforehand. There is no doubt that, although they may take adifferent line from us on individual subjects, Commonwealth countries generallylook to us for guidance on the general approach to the G.A.T.T.The Canadian delegation was intelligent and helpful, but somewhat toodidactic, especially for Australian tastes. I have already dealt with the attitude ofthe Australian delegation: it was most ably led. The South African delegation was a little aloof and cynical: standing firmly for multilateralism but sceptical ofits fulfilment. The Indian delegation was most ably led: it expounded what was(to us) often a bad case with great distinction and elegance. The delegations fromPakistan and the Federation were poor and inarticulate: that from New Zealandsteady, uninspired, loyal to the United Kingdom: that from Ceylon a one maneffort with a good deal of experience of the G.A.T.T. but with relatively littleinterest apart from pressure for more generous treatment of underdevelopedcountries. The problems of the Colonies were put with great skill and success bya number of speakers from Africa, the West Indies and the Mediterranean Colonies.
