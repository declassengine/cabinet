(54) 3314th November, 1954CABINETDEFENCE POLICY: MINESWEEPERSMemorandum by the Parliamentary and Financial Secretaryto the AdmiraltyMinesweepers today cost about  ^ million each. They can be built byrelatively few firms since the requirement that they should be non-magnetic makesthem a difficult undertaking for which special capacity has had to be created.2. The Chiefs of Staff have agreed that the mining threat is reduced. Thisview is based both on the assumption that the enemy would put our major portsout of action by thermo-nuclear attack, which would be more durable than miningtheir approaches, and on the long-term effect of the Allied strategic air offensive on the enemy&apos;s logistic support.3. Supplies will however still have to reach this country by sea. EveryRussian warship carries mines and we may confidently expect that the approaches to our smaller ports will be mined by sea and air.4. In C. (54) 250 it was stated that the Board&apos;s policy was to concentrate onbuildmg ships that would have a valuable role in both war and peace and thatin consequence nearly all the future building of the minesweeping fleet would be suspended. What has now to be decided is precisely how many Minesweepersshould be ordered each year to keep up the force and retain the capacity.5. The Board&apos;s considered opinion was that 40 should be built over thenext 4 years while Lord Alexander recommended 24. ,6. The crucial factor is that during the next few years the war-time fleet of mass-produced wooden Minesweepers is wearing out and if only 24 are built weshall reach the end of this decade with a Minesweeper fleet of 215 ships ascompared with 345 in 1956 and a requirement of some 600 in the first month ofwar. Further, the capacity to increase the building rate would be largely destroyed.It is this double effect of any further cut that confirmed the Board in its conclusionthat it would be most imprudent to plan on fewer than 10 a year.7. The Admiralty&apos;s objections are based on the strategic grounds set out above. The proposal to cut to 10 a year involves however serious industrialconsequences including heavy discharge of labour, especially in Northern Ireland,an area already affected by cuts proposed in aircraft.A.N.Admiralty, S.W.1,3rd November, 1954.47085
