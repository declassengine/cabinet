secret.(54) 31418th October, 1954COPY NO.CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND TRADEBilateral Agreement with Japan Memorandum by the President of the Board of trade we have shortly to take a decision about Japan&apos;s accession to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).    It is an important one.    No one who considers the balance of forces in the world, andparticularly in the Far East, would lightly recommend a course designedto exclude Japan from normal friendly commercial relations with theWest.    We must, however, also recognise both the real potential dangers of Japanese competition sustained by cheap labour and often backed by methods which are impossible to defend, and the deep passions whichthis subject can arouse in the United Kingdom.2.        We have with great difficulty obtained genex*al support for our commercial policy and our continued membership of the G.A.T.T.   Thishas not been easy either in the case of industry or of the conservative party.    It would be quickly lost if we accepted the obligations of theG.A.T.T. towards Japan without adequate safeguards.3.       Broadly there are two safeguards which we must have.     First,power to take emergency action if Japanese imports are causing real danger to our industry; and second, the right for other countries suchas Australia to preserve if they wished to do so the margin of additionalpreference which they now give to our goods over the Japanese.    Ifwe fail to get either of these safeguards I could not take the responsibilityof advising my colleagues to approve our acceptance of the Japaneseaccession to the Agreement.    In the following paragraphs I describe the events which have led up to the present situation, the nature of ourdetailed proposals and the course of action which I recommend.4.        On 27th July the External Economic Policy Committeeprovisionally approved my proposal that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould seek to have the G.A.T.T. so amended as to allow existing members to make their acceptance of an acceding member subject tothe terms of a bilateral agreement which would override the G.A.T.TThis would make it possible for us to support Japan&apos;s admission if she were prepared to negotiate a satisfactory bilateral agreement with us.    The Cabinet were subsequently informed by the Chancellor of theExchequer that the proposal should be put to the United States and theCommonwealth on the basis of C. (54) 2 68 (C. C. (54) 59th Conclusions,Minute 10).
5.        Our proposal was discussed with, the United States government during the recent talks in Washington at the time of the international monetary Fund meetings.    The United States Government dislike our proposal on the ground that the precedent of providing, however indirectly,for discrimination between two members of the G.A,T.T, will inevitablytend, in their judgment, to compromise the integrity of the G.A.T.T.They proposed therefore that countries which did not feel able to acceptunconditionally the obligations of the G.A. T.T. towards Japan should beallowed to accept the obligations on the basis that they would be free to suspend them if and when they wished to apply instead the terms of bilateral agreements subsisting between them and the Japanese.    ThisUnited States counter-proposal would not meet our necessary require-ments.    In the first place it would not be easy in practice for us to suspend the application of the G.A.T.T, to our relations with Japanevery time we might have occasion to take emergency safeguardingaction;  such suspension would be bound to cause friction with theJapanese, and the political objections would limit our freedom of action.Secondly, and more important, it would not be open to Australia,New Zealand and South Africa, as it would be under our form of solution,to reserve their freedom ab initio to retain existing tariff discrimina-tion against Japan; they would have to start by accepting the most-favoured-nation obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan and thiswould mean that on all items where they could not afford to reduce thediscriminatory duties now charged against Japan they would be obligedto increase the duties against all other countries, including us.6.       At last week&apos;s meeting with Commonwealth countries therewas no support for the United States counter-proposal.    Our ownproposal met with general sympathy, especially from Australia,New Zealand, South Africa and the Federation.    We have reason alsoto hope that we may have some European support; we know that theFrench are sympathetic, though at present disposed to invoke article XXXV (the effect of which would be to renounce&apos; any G.A.T.T.relationship with Japan).7.        I propose therefore that we should now tell the JapaneseGovernment of our proposal and that we should press it uponMr. Yoshida, the Japanese Prime Minister, when he is here next week.I attach the draft of an Aide Memoire communicating our proposal inwriting to the Japanese Government.    I suggest that in speaking toMr. Yoshida we should say bluntly that unless our proposal is acceptedby the Contracting Parties we shall have no alternative but to invoke article XXXV so as to refuse any G.A.T.T. relationship between us and japan.   It is important to ensure that Mr. Yoshida be left in no doubt about this.    The Americans have themselves acknowledged that a solution on the lines we propose would be better for Japan than the completelynegative remedy of invoking Article XXXV; but this basic consideration will not weigh effectively with them or with the Japanese so long as theycontinue to foster false hopes that if they hold out against us we shallultimately drop the idea of invoking Article XXXV and accept the fullobligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan.8.        I also propose that we should at the same time press our proposal similarly on Mr. Dulles personally through H. M. ambassador in Washington.-2-
9.        I therefore ask my colleagues to agree:-that our proposal should be put to the JapaneseGovernment immediately in the terms of theattached Aide Memoire;that our proposal should be pressed on theJapanese Prime Minister when he is inLondon next week; andthat H. M. Ambassador in Washington should similarly press our proposal on Mr. Dullespersonally.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.16th October, 1954.(a)(b)(c)
5*fAPPENDIXAIDE ME MOIREHer Majesty&apos;s Government have been considering the questionof Japan&apos;s   application to become a member of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    There is no need to re-state at length the grounds which have led Her Majesty&apos;s Government to feel that Japan&apos;s accession to G.A.T.T. would be likely to create special problems for them.    Theessential fact is that Japanese industry has shown in the past a capacity for development in particular manufactures so rapid that competingindustries in other countries have been unable to adjust themselves.In the light of damage thus caused to British industry no British Govern-ment could afford to treat Japan as a full member of G.A.T.T. withoutparticular safeguards.2.        As the Japanese Government are aware, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment tried unsuccessfully at meetings of the Inter-sessional Committee in1953 to secure agreement to certain amendments of the G.A.T.T. whichmight have relieved the problem if the United Kingdom proposals hadbeen wholly accepted.    These amendments were strongly opposed,however, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government have reluctantly reached theconclusion that it would be fruitless to continue to press those proposals.3.        It is of course open to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to invoke article XXXV and thus renounce any G.A.T.T. relationship between thetwo countries.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be very reluctant totake such a wide ranging action directed specifically against Japan.They are of the opinion that such action would have a damaging effecton political relations between the two countries.4,        Her Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered asuggestion that the proposal of Japanese accession might provide for a contracting Party to suspend its obligations towards Japan at any time after the new member&apos;s accession.    Such a procedure would not meetthe special problems of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and is therefore not acceptable.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore convinced thatthe only practical alternative to invoking Article XXXV would be a procedure on the lines indicated in the following paragraph.5.        Under the present provisions of the G.A.T.T. when a new memberjoins  the existing members may either accept all the rights and obliga-tions of the Agreement in relation to the new member or invoke article XXXV so as to accept none of these rights and obligations.But there is no middle course.    What Her Majesty&apos;s government propose is that the G.A.T.T. should be amended so as to provide a middle course, namely that an existing member should have the option to negotiate with the new member a bilateral agreement which wouldbe recognised by the other members as overriding the G.A.T.T. inthose matters in which it differed from the G.A.T.T,   It would thus beopen to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and other Governments in acorresponding position to negotiate with the Japanese Governmentmutually acceptable bilateral agreements and, subject to these agree-ments, to accept and support Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T.    Theterms of the bilateral agreements might vary according to the particularneeds of the countries concerned, e.g. in relation to any pre-existingtariff discrimination, but Her Majesty&apos;s Government would for their-4n .
srspart propose an agreement, which they would hope in due course to buildup into a comprehensive Commercial Treaty, on the lines set out in the annexed note.    The Japanese Government will observe that the basicprovision to modify the terms of the G.A.T.T. as they affect the two parties would be an escape clause for either, after due consultation withthe other, to take protective action in the case of certain defined formsof emergency.6.        In the event that any other members of the G.A.T.T..might still be disposed to invo ke Article XXXV, it would also be open to theJapanese Government to initiate bilateral talks with a view to avoidingthis on mutually acceptable terms.7.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the Japanese Governmentwill recognise that this proposal is put forward in a sincere desire toavoid the difficulties which Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T, mustotherwise entail for both countries.    It is the only method which her Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to discover for resolvingthe difficulties which have made it impossible for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to accept Japanese accession to the G.A.T.T. and her Majesty&apos;s Government sincerely hope that the Japanese Governmentwill share their view that it is to their mutual interest to negotiate asolution on these lines.ANNEXBILATERAL. AGREEMENT WITH JAPANDRAFT HEADS OF AGREEMENTI, Establishment ProvisionsThe Agreement might contain certain establishment provisions,to protect the nationals and companies of such party in the territories of the other.II. Goods ProvisionsMembership of the G.A.T.T. would of course provide for most-favoured-nation treatment.    This might also be provided for in the bilateral agreement.But there would be a right for either party, subject to prior consulation with the other , to apply a discriminatory quota or customs duty:-(i)   if the goods in question were being imported into its territory in a way that was causing,or threatening to cause, serious injury totrade in such goods produced at home orimported from other contracting parties;
(ii)   if the goods in question were being sold toimporters in its territory under conditionsof unfair trading or at artificially low pricesresulting from Government action (subsidies,etc.) or industrial practices (dumping, etc.).There would also be an appropriate provision dealing with theschedule of United Kingdom duties bound under the G.A.T.T.III. Navigational RightsIt is desired that the Agreement should contain provision for national and most-favoured-nation treatment for ships and shipping.
