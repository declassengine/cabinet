Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRET Copy No.   74C. (54) 3358th November, 1954CABINETUNITED KINGDOM LOAN TO PERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 29th July the Cabinet agreed that a loan of  5 millions should be offered to Persia through the Export Credits Guarantee Department (C.C. (54)36th Conclusions, Minute 7). The Persians have made no formal response but have indicated that they wished the amount to be  10 millions, the period of repayment 5 years and the interest 3J per cent, (instead of the 3 years and 4 percent, offered).2. Meanwhile Persia&apos;s foreign exchange position has deteriorated and herfree reserves are almost exhausted. In September the Central Bank was forcedto suspend most sterling payments, thus seriously checking the expansion of our trade with Persia.3. The United States Government have recently decided to offer during thenext eight months grants and loans totalling over $100 millions. This is enoughto secure Persian economic stability without further assistance from us; but itactually strengthens the case of increasing our own credit. It is very much inour economic and political interests to get a firm and early foothold in the expanding Persian market, and to see a substantial part of their future sterlingearnings from oil ( 100 millions annually within three years) spent on british exports. An improvement of our trading position will strengthen our politicaland cultural influence.4. A  5 millions credit is not sufficient to secure our ends. A proportionof it will be devoted to financing contracts already let to British firms and thebalance will not make an adequate contribution to financing new ones, which will go to the Americans or even to the French, who, with much less at stake, have offered the equivalent of  5 millions and are apparently ready to double it.5. We need, therefore, in our own interests to make an offer on terms whichthe Persians will accept at once, which will allow the flow of United Kingdomconsumer goods to resume and which will give our exporters a chance to competefor the many new development contracts.   10 millions should do this.6.   I recommend that (a) our existing offer should be increased from  5 millions to  10 millions;(b) as regards terms of agreement and interest, our offer should be made on conditions which the Persians can readily accept;(c) the credit should be conditional on the simultaneous resumption of sterlingpayments by the Persians.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6th November, 1954.47109
