The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...C.(54) 31720th October, 1954CABINETUGANDA PROTECTORATE;THE KABAKA OF BUGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in C. (54) 287 I warned my colleagues that it would become necessaryto review the decision on Kabaka Mutesa in the light of the new situation created by Professor Hancock&apos;s mission.    I set out the arguments infavour of opening the door to Mutesa&apos;s return in paragraph &amp; of that paper,and those in favour of standing firm on the decision to withhold recognitionin paragraph 7; and said that, while my inclination.at that time wastowards the former course, I would not make a final recommendation until after the hearing of the Court case designed to test the validity of thewithdrawal of recognition..    I proposed then to re-examine the argumentspro and con with the Governor, preferably after making a personalappreciation on the spot.2.        During my recent visit to Uganda, which took place immediatelyafter the Court hearing had been concluded and before the delivery of judgment (which is expected on or shortly after 25th October) I had fulldiscussions with the Governor, his officials and leading unofficials of allraces.    Before leaving for Africa I also talked the question over withProfessor Hancock.    No new arguments emerged from these discussions;but I found that, seeing things on the spot, I came to attach greater weight to those against Mutesa&apos;s return than I had been inclined to do from london; and that the balance, always close, shifted definitely to this side.    I therefore reached the conclusion that it would not be in theinterests of Uganda (or of our position in Africa as a whole) to send the kabaka back as an act of policy on our part.    I also felt, however, thatif the decision of the Court should go against us to the extent of indicating that our action was unjustified it would be impossible not to accept thatdecision.3.        Opinion in Uganda is divided.    The Governor himself fullyadheres to the recommendation in paragraph 9 of C. (54) 287 that,whenthe Hancock proposals are put to the Lukiko at the end of this month,Her lvlajesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative in announcing that,since an entirely new situation would be created by acceptance of theseproposals, it would be open to the Lukiko (after an interval for the newconstitution to get on to its feet) to decide whether to have Mutesa back.The Governor thinks the choice is between two risks: one of increasingtrouble, a possible breakdown of administration and increasingly badrelations with the Baganda which might lead to their permanent estrange-ment; the other the risk of appearing to be weak by a reversal of policy.
He considers that, given strong leadership, the second risk could be mitigated or overcome.    The view that the way should be cleared forMutesa to return (after an interval and subject to conditions) isunreservedly shared by Professor Hancock, and on balance by the out-going and incoming Residents of Buganda, the Anglican and roman catholic Bishops of Uganda, the Principal of Makerere, the Timescorrespondent in Uganda and the Chairman of the Uganda development corporation who is also one of the unofficial members of ExecutiveCouncil.     (The African unofficial member of Executive Council, aMuganda elder statesman, and the Indian Mayor of Kampala, sit on thefence. )4.        On the other hand, apart from the Resident of Buganda, the senior officials at the Centre and from all parts of the Protectorate aregenerally, some of them very strongly, convinced that to open the doorto Mutesa&apos;s return would be contrary to the long-term interests of Ugandaand damaging to our position in the Protectorate.    The majority of the junior officials in Buganda are also opposed to such a course, as aretwo of the three African Regents of Buganda and, on balance, the secondEuropean unofficial member of Executive Council.    Their views, ingeneral, are that the ordinary African would never understand, or accept,the argument that a new situation had been created by the Hancockproposals.    The return of Mutesa would be regarded as a reversal ofpolicy and would be claimed as a victory by the Uganda National Congress,an extreme nationalist body who have been putting it about that theywould secure Mutesa&apos;s return.    It would be taken as a sign of weaknessthroughout the Protectorate and various demands designed to weaken theauthority of the Protecting Power in other parts of the Protectorate(where Mutesa&apos;s removal was popular) would be likely soon to follow.The bad elements in the country would be encouraged and the loyal setback, or even in some cases victimised, and Mutesa&apos;s personal influencewould be used behind the scenes to damage the new constitutional arrange-ments and to preclude any permanent improvement in relations betweenthe Baganda and the Protectorate Government.5.        I am impressed by the strength of this side of the case.    Itseems to me clear that the reliable and moderate elements among theBaganda are against Mutesa&apos;s return, that the Civil Service in Ugandawould be much embarrassed if Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision were reversed and the whole fabric of government weakened.    We must expect a renewed decision to hold our ground to be followed by a periodof uneasiness and there may even be some trouble.    But I am not convinced that there will be and I believe the dangers of the contrarycourse to-be considerably greater.6.       At the same time I am sure that it would not be possible tomaintain the present decision if the Uganda High Court on the factualissue were to find that the Kabaka did not fail to co-operate loyally.While I am advised that such a finding is unlikely, it is a possibilitywhich we cannot leave out of account.    I am also sure that in such an event we should not take the issue to appeal.    Not only am I advised thatthe finding of the High Court on this issue of fact is unlikely to be reversed by an Appeal Tribunal but, whatever the outcome, the positionof the Uganda Administration would be untenable in the face of an adversedecision by their own Chief Justice.    In this event I am convinced thatwe must accept the finding and permit Mutesa&apos;s return.    (If we should-2-
win on this point in the High Court, but on appeal by the plaintiffs the find-ing were reversed by the East African Court of Appeal, I would not in that event preclude an appeal by the Crown to the Privy Council. )7.        This consideration has led me to consider whether there wouldnot be substantial advantage in linking a statement of Her Majesty&apos;governments decision with the decision of the Courts.    In case of afavourable judgment, a statement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe guided by the decision of the Courts would, in my view, be much more acceptable to public opinion, both here and especially in Uganda, than a flat statement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government stood by the decision to withhold recognition;  while, in the case of an unfavourable judgment,as I have said immediately above I doubt whether we should have any real alternative.    A statement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be guided by the decision of the Courts could not be made before judgment wasgiven (since the Baganda would then suspect that the Government hadreceived advance information of the nattire of the judgment) but should clearly be made, if at all, as quickly as possible afterwards if it is tohave its effect.8.        I discussed this possible course of action with the Governor andhis senior advisers on my last evening in Uganda.    The Governor, while making it clear that he stood by his earlier recommendation, consideredthat an announcement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would abide by the ruling of the Courts would create a situation in Uganda that would not beimpossible to hold or defend.    It would, in his view, provide strongground for urging the Lukiko to take definite decisions on the Hancockrecommendations, even though they might still reject them, or postponea decision, on the grounds of Mutesa&apos;s absence.    Both he and his advisers fully supported the view that an announcement on these lines would be greatly preferable to a plain reaffirmation of the finality oflast year&apos;s&quot;decision.    This view (on how to present the decision) wasshared by all concerned in Uganda, whether or not they favoured Mutesa&apos; return.    Should the case go against us on the factual issue of loyalty,and it be then decided to have Mutesa back, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be considered in Uganda to have bowed to the majesty of EnglishLaw and not to the fulminations of the Uganda National Congress.9.        I accordingly recommend to my colleagues that, as soon as Ihave received and studied the Court judgment, I be authorised to take action as follows:-(a)    If the High Court has found unequivocally that the Kabakadid not fail to co-operate loyally, I will announce immediatelythat, in view of the new situation created by the HighCourt decision, I have invited the Governor, the Kabaka and representatives of the Lukiko to a very early discussion inLondon which v/ill deal both with the situation created bythe High Court decision and with the agreed recomrnenda-tions reached as a result of the conference held binderProfessor Hancock&apos;s auspices.I should see Mutesa before making this announcement and endeavour to persuade him to take no action until this conference had been held.    I should hope to be successful in this;  but, if I were not, I should not take any action tokeep him out of the Protectorate.
(b) If the High Court has found unequivocally that the Kabakadid fail to co-operate loyally, I will make a statement inreply to an arranged Parliamentary Question; in this statement I will say that now the High Court has affirmedthe decision taken to withdraw recognition from Mutesa,Her Majesty&apos;s Government stands by that decision.    IfI am asked what will happen if the judgment of the Courtis reversed on appeal, I should decline to give a definite answer to a hypothetical question.    (The Governor wouldhave liked me to make it clear in my statement that, ifthe finding of the High Court were reversed on appeal,Her Majesty&apos;s Government would accept the finding of thehighest Court.    I have discussed this with the Attorney-General who feels there are objections to the course proposed by the Governor.)(c) If the High Court in its judgment does not find unequivocallyone way or the other on the point of substance, I shallconsult with the Attorney-General with a view to adoptingone of the above courses if appropriate.   If it should benecessary in this event, I will consult my colleagues inthe Cabinet again.A.T. L. -B.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.19th October, 1954.
