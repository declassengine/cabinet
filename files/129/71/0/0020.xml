CYPRUS:  LAWS RELATING TO SEDITION AND THE PRESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies recent statement by the Attorney-General of Cyprusabout enforcement of the existing sedition and press laws was criticised by all sections of the press here as illiberal.    I have to make a statement in the House about these laws next Thursday, 28th October, in reply to abatch of Opposition Questions.2. I have been into this very fully with the Governor during his visit.    The law of sedition has been in the Cyprus Criminal Code formany years.    It is probable that incitement to violence is a necessaryelement of the offence of sedition in this country but that is not so in cyprus or probably in the majority of colonies.    The only provision whichdifferentiates this part of the Cyprus law from that in most other colonies(which, apart from the point mentioned above, follows English law) is onemaking sedition an intention to bring about a change in the sovereignty ofthe Colony.    This existed during the whole of our predecessors1 term of office, having been inserted after the riots in Cyprus in 1931,    I do notconsider that it would be practical politics in Cyprus to-day to remove this long-standing part of the law;  and I see no case for any change in the cyprus Criminal Law relating to sedition.3. I propose to say this in my statement; but I am prepared toarrange for a relaxation (with which the Governor agrees) over the PressLaw.    One part of this, dating from 1947, provides for penalties includingsuspension of publication for up to three years on any newspaper publisherconvicted by the Courts of seditious or other libel.    These penalties arenot essential in practice.    They can readily be got round, and the otherexisting laws are sufficient.4. I propose to announce that I am asking the Governor to arrangefor the removal of this Section of the Press Law.    The press in Cypruswill then be subject to no more and no less than the ordinary and long-standing Cyprus law concerning seditious utterances.    I think this shouldremove the suspicion created by the Cypriot Attorney-General&apos;s detailedrecital of penalties that the legal position in Cyprus puts the press in aworse position than in this country.    In fact, under the law in Cyprus (asamended), the penalties to which the press are liable for sedition would be broadly similar to those in this country.5. In addition, as suggested at the Cabinet meeting on 22nd October(C,C.(54)69th Conclusions, Minute 3), I propose to take the opportunity of re-stating our general view on the issue of sovereignty.&apos;       &apos;6. I seek my colleagues agreement.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.22nd October, 1954,COPY NO. 66CABINETSECRETC(54) 32023rd October, 1954
