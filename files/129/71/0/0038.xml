C.(54) 33810th November, 1954CABINETUGANDA PROTECTORATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesWith reference to paragraph 8 of C. (54) 336, I attach a draft ofmy proposed statement announcing the Governments decision to the Houseof Commons.    The statement is not necessarily in final form and I wouldnot wish to be tied to the precise wording of the present draft.A.L-3.Colonial Office, S.W.I.9th November, 1954.DRAFT statement with permission I wish to make a Statement on the situation inBuganda.In recent months two new factors have emerged!&quot;The first is the agreement reached on constitutional matters atthe Conference at Namirembe presided over by Sir Keith Hancock.The second is the judgment in the case brought in the UgandaHigh Court to test the validity of the action taken last year by her Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the Kabaka Mutesa II,A copy of this judgment was placed in the Library last week,and I am to-day placing there copies of the recommendations of theNamirembe Conference.The Conference agreed to recommend -(1)  That Buganda should continue as ah integral partof the Prote ctorate of Uganda.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..^......
(2) That for the future Kabakas should be constitutionalrulers with Ministers responsible for the conductof public affairs and the Kabaka being required toenter into a solemn engagement to accept the new arrangements,These and other recommendations are being presented to-day to the Great LukikocAt&quot; the same time the Governor is announcing certain proposed changes in the Executive and Legislative Councils of the Protectorate -(1)  That there should be 30 instead of 20 African Membersof the Legislative Council.(2) A Ministerial system should be introduced with sixos? seven Official and five Unofficial Members,three of the latter being African.(3)    It is further recommended that no major change shouldbe made in the new constitutional arrangementseither for Buganda or the Protectorate for a periodof six years.A copy of the Governor&apos;s statement will also be placed in the library,,    The agreed recommendations create a new situation in Bugandaand if accepted by the Great Lukiko and carried into effect should settlesatisfactorily the points of difference which arose last year and preventtheir recurrence.The second new factor is the judgment of the Uganda HighCourt.The Chief Justice refused all the declarations asked for by thePlaintiffs,    He held that there was no legal right to recognition vested inthe Kabaka and that it was not therefore necessary for the Court to cometo a conclusion on the question of the right to withdraw recognition.    Incase however the ruling should be upset.on appeal the Chief Justicerecorded his views on the question.    He held that the Kabaka&apos;s refusal to abide by Her Majesty^ Governments decisions on policy constituteddisregard of his duty under the terms of the 1900 Agreement to acknowledgeand abide by the overrule of the Crown, and that in consequenceHer Majestyls Government would have been justified in bringing theAgreement to an end under Article 20 of the Agreements  action which her Majesty&apos;s Government did not however take0    The Chief Justicealso found that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were mistaken in withdrawingrecognition from the Kabaka under Article 6, because in his view a rightunder Article 6 to withdraw recognition had not arisen on30th November, 1953.    In essence, in his view, it would seem that he held that Pier Majesty^ Government were justified in taking action -which, as the House will recall, my predecessor, Lord Chandos, tookwith the greatest possible reluctance - against Mutesa II, but that theyacted wrongly in basing that action on Article 6 of the Agreement.Her Majesty^ Government have at all times said that they considered themselves bound by the Agreement, and its scrupulousobservance seems to Her Majesty&apos;s Government a matter of the firstconcern.
In the light of the new situation Her Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided that subject to certain conditions the Great Lukiko should after an interval be given the opportunity to choose whether a new Kabaka shouldbe elected or whether Kabaka Mutesa II should return as Native Rulerof Buganda.    The conditions are -(1)  The agreed recommendations of the NamirembeConference should be accepted as a whole by theGreat Lukiko 0(2)    The amendments and additions to the 1900 agreement to give effect to the agreed recommendations and theterms of the Solemn Engagement to be entered intoby the Kabaka should be agreed by Her Majesty!sGovernment and the Great Lukiko and the amendingagreement should be formally executed by theGovernor on behalf of Her majesty&apos;s Governmentand by the Regent and representatives of theLukiko on behalf of Buganda and&apos;be brought intoeffecto(3)  In order that the new arrangements may be well established before it is called on to make thedecision, the choice of the Great Lukiko whetherKabaka Mutesa II should return as Native Ruler orwhether a new Kabaka should be elected should bemade nine months after the new arrangements havebeen brought into effect.    Her Majestyls Govern-ment will make every effort to ensure that they are brought into effect by 31st March next year.(4)  When the choice of the Lukiko has been made, the kabaka should be required to enter into theSolemn Engagement before he was recognised by her Majesty&apos;s Government.The decisions which I have announced have been made on theassumption that there will be no appeal in the case recently heard by theHigh Court.    If an appeal were to go forward, it would, of course, benecessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to await the final judgment andthen to consider the whole position again9These decisions have the full support of the Governor of Ugandawho is communicating them to-day to the Great Lukiko.
