Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRET Copy No. 77C. (54) 3303rd November, 1954CABINETRELINQUISHMENT OF CERTAIN POWERS OF THE allied high COMMISSION IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in the Declaration of Intent which formed part of the Final Act of the Nine-Power Conference in London, the Governments of France, the United Kingdomand the United States of America instructed their High Commissioners in Germanynot to use those powers which they at present hold, but which they will relinquishwhen the occupation ends, unless with the agreement of the Federal GermanGovernment. The only exceptions to this instruction relate to powers in the field of disarmament and demilitarisation and to cases where the Federal Governmentis not yet able, for legal reasons, to take the action or assume the obligationscontemplated in the agreed arrangements to end the occupation.2. The detailed application of this policy has been under consideration bythe United Kingdom High Commissioner in Bonn who has submittedrecommendations as to which of their present powers the three high commissioners should immediately cease to exercise. These recommendationshave been accepted inter-departmentally at the official level and I need only draw the attention of my colleagues to one of them, namely, that the Allied high commission should forthwith hand over to the Germans control of civil aviation,subject only to the safeguards which we would retain under the Bonn Conventions(i.e., control over air corridors to Berlin). If this recommendation is endorsed bythe three Governments, it will mean that the Germans will be able almost at once to operate their own air services, as they will in any case be entitled to do as soonas the treaties come into force and the occupation ends.3. Acceptance of recommendations on these lines would be the logicaloutcome,of the Declaration of Intent.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1954.47078
