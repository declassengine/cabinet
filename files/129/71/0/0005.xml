k Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954.confidential. (54) 3054th October, 1954CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF THE european coal AND STEEL community memorandum by the Minister of Supply. On 26th May the Cabinet approved the policy to be followed in thenegotiations for an agreement with the European Coal and Steel Community onthe lines recommended by the Ministerial Committee in C. (54) 173; and I wasentrusted with responsibility for the conduct of these negotiations (C.C. (54)36th Conclusions, Minute 7).2. In order to pave the way for the formal meeting in London and to ensurethat there was no risk of any serious last-minute hitch, I have had a series of privatetalks with M. Monnet and two of his colleagues in Paris.3. As was expected, M. Monnet was at first most insistent that the Britishtariff should be reduced as a pre-condition for any agreement. However, aftermany hours of discussion, he agreed to drop this idea and to accept our proposal that the agreement should be confined to the setting up of a &quot;Council of association &quot; on a purely consultative basis.4. I have agreed with M. Monnet, subject to confirmation by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in London and the High Authority in Luxembourg, the text of a JointCommunique summarising the aims and duties of the new Council of Association(Annex A).5. At Annex B (Column 3) I attach the text of a draft agreement which Ihave likewise agreed with M. Monnet, again subject to confirmation on both sides.For purposes of comparison I have included also the text proposed by M. Monnet(Column 1), as well as the text proposed by me in accordance with the instructions of the Committee of Ministers (Column 2). M. monnet  draft contained a numberof features which were obviously unacceptable by reason of the fact that theytended to give the new Council an executive and &quot; supra-national&quot; character.However, it will be seen that in the agreed text, in Column 3, these objectionablefeatures have been eliminated.6. The National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board have been consulted and they in turn have consulted their respective industries. . As a result,the Minister of Fuel and Power and I are satisfied that there are unlikely to beobjections to the agreement from either of these quarters.7. It is proposed that the four representatives of the United KingdomGovernment on the new Council of Association should include the Chairmen ofthe two Boards.8. Subject to certain points of detail, which I am looking into, the Committeeof Ministers have approved the draft Communique (Annex A) and the draft^agreement (Annex B, Column 3).;&apos;9. I invite the Cabinet to authorise me to confirm these two documents withM. Monnet and to arrange for the formal meeting in London to take place as soonas possible. ^Copy No. 68Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2.,2nd October, 1954,46909b
-   ANNEX ADRAFT JOINT COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THE AGREEMENTOU &apos;Revised Text, as agreed (subject to confirmation) between the Minister ofSupply and M. Monnet in Paris on 29th September1. From the outset the United Kingdom Government has welcomed the conception of the Schuman Plan, both on account of its contribution to the efficiency and stability of the basic industries of the countries concerned and on accountof its contribution to the wider cause of European unity.2. When the European Coal and Steel Community was formed, the UnitedKingdom Government declared its desire to establish an intimate and enduringassociation with the Community, and this declaration was warmly welcomed by theHigh Authority.3. As a first step towards this objective the United Kingdom government established diplomatic relations with the High Authority and on 1st September,1952, a Delegation, headed by Sir Cecil Weir, took up its duties at Luxembourg.4. In view of the substantial progress which has since then been made by theHigh Authority in its task of creating a common market in coal and steel withinthe area of the Community, the United Kingdom Government and the high authority consider that the time has now come to take a further step in thedevelopment of the relations between the United Kingdom Government and theCommunity.5. With this object the United Kingdom Government and the High authority have concluded an Agreement to set up a Council of Association composed of four representatives of the United Kingdom Government and four representativesof the High Authority.6. The function of the Council of Association will be to provide means for continuing consultation on matters of mutual interest relating to coal and steel and,where appropriate, on the preparation and co-ordination of parallel action to dealwith common problems. (The addition of a new sentence giving the substance of Article 7 is to be considered.)7. It is recognised that the extent of the benefits to be obtained will inevitablydepend upon the extent to which normal trade can flow between the UnitedKingdom and the Community. The Council of Association has therefore beengiven the duty to examine restrictions and other factors affecting mutual tradein coal and steel between the two areas, with a view to making, for their mutualbenefit, such recommendations as may be agreed for their reduction or elimination.8. The Agreement also provides a procedure for joint consultation, where necessary, between the United Kingdom Government, the High Authority andthe Council of Ministers of the Community.9. In order to ensure continuous contact in the interval between the meetingsof the Council of Association, the United Kingdom Government will maintain its representation in Luxembourg and the High Authority will similarly establishrepresentation in London.10. While paying due regard to the interests of third countries and to thespecial relationship between the United Kingdom and the other members of theCommonwealth, both parties trust that by these new arrangements it may be foundpracticable before long to take further steps in the development of a growingassociation, which they believe will contribute to their common prosperity and assist in the promotion of European unity.
