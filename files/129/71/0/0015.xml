i 1 ^7tTHIS DOCUIVIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 315 COPY NO. 7/18th October, 1954.cabinet civil DEFENCE;  manpower memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh-affairs my colleagues will be aware that the Civil Defence (armed forces) Bill has been passed by the House of Lords and is coming beforethe House of Commons for its second reading as soon as the Housereassembles.    The Bill provides statutory authority for all members of the armed forces to be employed on Civil Defence duties, and to undergo civil defence training, but the effective measures which have been contemplatedand which were announced in the House of Lords are confined to giving afortnights Civil Defence training in each of two successive years to annualintakes of 15,000 National Service Reservists of the R.A.F. during their period of part-time service.    A small proportion of these may be availablefor a third period of a fortnights training.2. This scheme, which is as far as the Service Departments havebeen able to go in the light of their other commitments, is a first step in creating a war reserve of full-time manpower trained in civil defence.While the Bill was unopposed in the House of Lords the scheme was criticised as being inadequate.    The principal points which have been made against the scheme both in Parliament and elsewhere are:-(i)  that it will be many years before a numericallysignificant force has been developed onthis basis;(ii) that only in respect of the small minority whoare available for a third period of training will it be possible to carry out any unittraining;(iii) that the scheme does not provide for anyoperational organisation in being against a sudden emergency.3. That these criticisms had some substance was recognised fromthe start, but I was fully prepared to defend the scheme on a number of validgrounds, and in particular that the basis of our policy is the prevention of,rather than the preparation for war.4. Since the announcement of this scheme the question of civil defence has had a good deal of public attention, including a debate in theHouse of Commons and publicity in connection with Coventry, and criticismhas not diminished.
m5. The draft of a &quot;White Paper setting out the effects of attack withnuclear weapons and explaining the steps to counter them which are to betaken by the Services (including the Civil Defence Services) is now beingconsidered by the Departments concerned.    The situation is rightlydescribed in the most sombre and awe-inspirittg terms.    When this white paper is published, the civil defence plans which have hitherto been announced will be made to look quite inadequate to deal with the expectedsituation in the event of war.6. In these circumstances the Government is likely to be open todamaging criticism, particularly if the Second Reading of the Bill is at about the same time as the publication of the White Paper, and in my view it is vital that I should not have to give the impression in the Second Readingthat the scheme already announced is the only measure the government proposes for strengthening the civil defences of the country.    I think that itis of the highest importance that I should state positively that the Governmentis now reconsidering the whole question of civil defence and intends to announce as soon as possible further substantial measures to meet the kindof situation described in the White Paper.7. I can see no escape from a substantial part of any such measures being provided in one form or another by the Armed Services.The kind of thing I have in mind is that most, if not all, service personnelshould receive some civil defence training; and that a complete course oftraining in the specialist tasks of firefighting and rescue (which in the caseof formed units would require not more than one month a year) should begiven to a limited number of units.    Even if I do not make any specific reference to particular measures, I wish to have the approval of mycolleagues to indicating that we intend to use the Bill for purposes of thiskind.8. I therefore recommend(i)  that the Cabinet should agree that in movingthe Second Reading of the Civil Defence(Armed Forces) Bill I should indicate that theGovernment is contemplating using the Bill forsubstantially wider purposes than those already announced;(ii) that the Service   Departments should be invitedto consider what steps should be taken to carryout the suggestions in paragraph 7 above.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1,16th October, 1954.-2-
