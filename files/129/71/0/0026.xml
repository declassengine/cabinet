mPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1954SECRET Copy No.     *J gC. (54) 32627th October, 1954CABINETTHE ECONOMIC CONTROL REGULATIONSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Cabinet, on 20th October, had before them my memorandum C. (54) 310reviewing plans for legislation in the next session, and a memorandum by theformer Home Secretary (C. (54) 311) about measures to dispense with furtheremergency powers. They agreed to appoint a Committee under my chairmanship&quot; to examine in detail the proposals for legislation in the next session, includinglegislation to replace emergency powers, and to submit their recommendations tothe Cabinet&quot; (C.C. (54) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. An immediate decision by the Cabinet is required on the recommendation in C. (54) 311 that an Order in Council should now be made, which would revokein part the economic control regulations i.e., Defence Regulation 55 and the associated regulations and specify the limited purposes for which they might beused. If such an Order is to be made, it is very desirable that it should be referredto in the Home Secretary&apos;s annual White Paper on &quot; Continuance of emergency legislation.&quot; This White Paper must be laid not later than 5th November, if,as is the present intention, the annual debates in both Houses on the continuanceof emergency powers are to be held during the week beginning 15th November.3. The considerations which led to the recommendation that such an order should be made were set out in paragraphs 1 to 6 of C. (54) 311. My committee agreed that the only practicable alternative to the making of such an Order wasto do nothing in the immediate future about the wide economic powers conferred by these regulations. They recognised that such inaction offered the prospect of avoiding debate in the next session upon a number of highly controversial topics.On the other hand, they felt strongly that Government supporters in parliament would be opposed to complete inaction in the matter and that, while they wouldbe disappointed with the proposed Order in Council for not going far enough,the Order was the minimum measure with which they were likely to rest content.Discussion upon it in Parliament would only arise on a prayer for its annulment,and for this one day&apos;s debate should suffice. The Committee agreed, therefore,that the balance of advantage appeared to be in favour of proceeding with it.Conclusion4.   Accordingly, on behalf of the Committee, I invite the Cabinet:  (1) to approve the making of an Order in Council, to come into operation on 1st January, 1955, having the object of narrowing the scope of theeconomic control regulations;(2) to remit to the Ministerial Committee on Emergency Legislationresponsibility for approving the terms of the Order.5. I shall submit a further memorandum about legislation in the next sessionas soon as the Committee have completed their detailed examination of theproposed programme.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W.1,26th October, 1954.47042
