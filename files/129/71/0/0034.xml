(THISTDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)_________________....__..___._______,__..___......__......______..____,__u__.....____.__;..confidential.(54) 334 COPY NO. u6th November, 1954CABINETROYAL FLIGHTS; POSITIONING OF H.M. ships for SEARCH AND RESCUE DUTIESMemorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyWhen Her Majesty The Queen, His Royal Highness The Duke of edinburgh, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother or Her royal highness The Princess Margaret fly considerable distances over the seathe Royal Air Force, who are responsible for the Search and Rescueorganisation, provide an air escort consisting of one aircraft about an hour&apos;sflight ahead of the Royal aircraft with another following itj  both areequipped with survival gear.    The Royal Navy posts ships along theproposed route of the flight.    These arrangements would also apply in thecase of the Royal children.2.        Y/hile such flights are becoming more frequent, reductions inthe Fleet are making it increasingly difficult to provide ships for this dutywithout serious disturbance to Fleet programmes.    For example, the task of posting ships for the flights of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaretto and from the West Indies in February would halve the number of home fleet destroyers and frigates available to take part in the combined Homeand Mediterranean Fleet Spring Exercises in the Gibraltar area; and the extra cost of providing the ships would be  40,000.    I understand thatHer Royal Highness thinks that ships should be dispensed with for these twoflights and that Her Majesty&apos;s Private Secretary believes that there would beno objection.3.        I should have no hesitation in accepting the disturbance to the Fleetduring these and other flights, and the extra expenditure, if I were convinced of the usefulness of the ships in the event of an accident to the Royal air-craft.    But, with the routes of the flights liable to alteration at short noticebecause of bad weather, there can be no guarantee that the ships would be within hundreds of miles, and they thus become no more than a ceremonial -and distant - escort.4.        I have discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for air and the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.    The latter tells me thathe hopes that by February the pilots of Royal aircraft will have information from which they can calculate the position of shipping in the areas over which they are to fly.    Thus if the aircraft had to come down, the pilotcould make for the nearest ship which would be warned and would use allher visual and radio devices to give the aircraft her exact position.    Thisconfirms my opinion that the practice of posting ships can no longer bejustified except for flights by the Sovereign where, I suggest, the ceremonialaspect would outweigh other considerations.
&amp; * [2jd5.        I recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure be taken on theproposal that H.M. Ships should no longer be posted on the prospectiveroutes of Royal aircraft except during Her Majesty&apos;s own flights.    TheSecretary of State for Air assures me that there is, of course, no questionof the Royal Air Force discontinuing the air escort.J.P.L.T.Admiralty, S.W.I.5th November, 1954.
