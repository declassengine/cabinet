SEC BETG.(54) 303 COPY NO.2nd October, 1954CABINET5&quot;!SCAMPTON AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Weir h affairs on 21st Septembers 1954, the Cabinet decided that the developmentof Scampton as a Class I airfield should go forward, unless within a fort-night it could be shown, to the satisfaction of the Home Secretary, theMinister of Labour and the President of the Board of Trade, that theestimate that the development of any suitable alternative airfield wouldinvolve an additional cost of  if millions was incorrect, in which event the matter should be considered again by the Cabinet (C. C. (54) 6lstConclusions, Minute 4).2.        With my two colleagues, I have now examined the development plans of the Air Ministry on which the above estimate of additional costis based.    We have compared the plan for Scampton with that forHemswell which is said to be the cheapest practicable alternative, andis indeed the alternative put forward by the local authority.    Apart fromHemswell and the twelve airfields mentioned in the Annex to thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (C. (54) 292), the fewairfields which are suitably placed for Class I purposes would needconsiderably more development work and the cost would be very much higher.3.        The comparison of the costs of development at Scampton andHemswell is as follows  millionsScamptonA ir fie Id e xpe nditur e 1,28(runway and perimeter extensions,hard standings, drainage, fencing,lighting and navigational aids, etc.)Earthworks . 12Ermine Street diversion .15Buildings 1.17Total 2.72
4.        The estimate of additional expenditure at Hemswell of 1. 63 millions is almost entirely attributable to earthworks, which is the filling in or building up of the land under the runways to avoid inclinessteeper than those which can be tolerated for the operation of   medium bombers.    At both airfields, it is the north east-south west runway whichwould have to be extended, in order to make use of the prevailing wind.5.       At Hemswell, owing to the escarpment at the south west, theextension of the runway would have to be at the north east end.    Thetake-off there would normally have to be up hill, and to offset this, theextension of the runway would have to be 500 feet longer than at Scampton.Moreover, to avoid too steep an incline during the latter part of the take-off,there would have to be a considerable filling in, to a depth of (at thedeepest part) fourteen feet.    (Representatives of the local authority wereincorrectly informed that the depth was thirty feet; but the costings are based on the correct figure of fourteen feet.)6.        At Scarnpton, the greater part of the extension of the runway would be at the north east end and, although the groundgradually falls away there, this would be at the beginning of the normaltake-off run, where an uphill incline of up to 1 in 100 can be tolerated.Consequently, despite the fall of ground, there is need to fill only acomparatively small and shallow saucer.7.        Comparing the two, 2,250,000 cubic yards would have to be filled at Hemswell, but only 300,000 cubic yards at Scampton.8.        There are other objections to developing Hemswell, one of themost important being that the flight path of aircraft taking off from therewould cut the approach lane to Sturgate, which is being developed as an american long-range fighter base.    If Hemswell were to be developed,Sturgate would have to be abandoned; another base would have to befound, and the  500,000 already spent at Sturgate would be wasted.9.        In the light of these facts, and our study of the plans and charts,I and my two colleagues think that the estimate of the additional cost issoundly based.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1.1st October . 1954.2-HemswellAirfield expenditure 1.65Earthworks 1.5Buildings 1.2Total 4.35
