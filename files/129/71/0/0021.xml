secret.(54) 321 COP23rd October, 1954CABINETy no.OVERSEAS INFORMATION services memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in C. (54) 296 the Foreign Secretary urges the Cabinet totake an early decision on the Drogheda Report on Overseas information services, and to accept the recommendation of the Home Secretary&apos;sCommittee, set out in C. (54) 185, that expenditure on the overseas information services should be increased from the present annual rate of;110^- millions to a rate of  12f millions by seven annual increases of 357,000, the first of these increases to fall in 1955/56.    These figures,of course, make no allowance for rises in the cost of existing activities.2. I agree that an early decision on the financial provision forthe overseas information services for 1955/56 is a matter of urgency, and Isympathise with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s wish to be in a position to make astatement to Parliament on the Governments attitude to the recommendationsof the Drogheda Committee.    I sympathise too with his desire to have athis disposal strong and efficient information services overseas for thesupport of our foreign policy.3. I consider, however, that in the overseas information services,as in the defence programme, our objective must be to secure the best possible value for the money we can afford to devote to them, by spendingmore on the essential and much less on the merely desirable or inessential.I suggest that a small committee of Ministers representing the three overseas departments, under the chairmanship of a Minister without departmental responsibility, might, with the aid of the official Overseas InformationCommittee, consider urgently how total expenditure on overseas information services in 1955/56 can - by the re-alignment of resources on the lines suggested below, which were also those postulated by the Drogheda Report -be brought within the limit of  9^ millions recommended by the Committeeon Civil Expenditure .4. Meanwhile I remind my colleagues that the Home Secretary&apos;srecommendations were explicitly made &quot;irrespective of any Economies whichmay have to be undertaken as the result of other deliberations&quot;, and were thus in no way excluded from consideration by Lord Swinton&apos;s Committeewhich examined the whole field of civil expenditure in relation to the serious problems of my 1955 Budget.5. It was the considered view of Lord Swinton&apos;s Committee thatthe overseas information services ought not to be exempt from the economies which it was imperative to make, not only in the social services, in thesupport programme for agriculture and in all other fields of civil expenditure,both at home and overseas, but also in the defence programme, which is after all the strongest weapon of all in the armoury of our foreign policy.
Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.22nd October, 1954.6. I think that the case against singling out the overseas information services for increased expenditure, at a time when many other services, about the value of which there is much less room for dispute, areto suffer reductions, is very strong.    But apart even from the 1955budgetary problem, I am not at all convinced that increased expenditure isnecessary to improve the efficiency of the overseas information services.The Drogheda Committee itself recognised in a general way that we havespread our resources too thinly in overseas information work over too large a field, and they themselves recommended that reductions shouldbe made in certain areas and media in order to strengthen our efforts inthe most important fields.    Unfortunately the Drogheda Committee failedto apply these admirable principles when they came to make specific proposals.     There was a not unnatural reluctance, which is, of course,shared by the. Departments and agencies concerned, to make proposals fordrastic changes in the framework of our overseas information services.The Committee, therefore, sought an easy solution by the method of recommending increased expenditure in the directions which they thoughtimportant, without anything like countervailing reductions in the directionswhich they themselves declared to be of lesser importance.    Nearly a yearago I set out in C. (53) 3Z1 some of the ways in which, in my view, theadmirable principles of the Drogheda Report could be effectively furtheredwithout heavy new expense.......7. I suggest it would be of advantage if the governments proposals on the subject of the overseas information sex-vices were explained to Parliament at about the same time as the issue of the proposed White Paperdescribing the re-alignment of our defence effort.R.A.B.
