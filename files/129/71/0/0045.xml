secret(54) 345 COPY NO.13th November, 1954CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS;MAINTENANCE BASE AT RENFREWMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation on 30th October the Home Affairs Committee instructedme to submit to the Cabinet the question of closing the maintenance base at Renfrew (H.A0(54) 27th Meeting, Item 3)02. During recent years British European Airways (B.E.A.) have maintained their Viking and Pionair aircraft at Renfrew.    The Viking was withdrawn from service last month and the Pionairs are in process of being withdrawn.3. In view both of this and of the completion at London Airportof a large base capable of doing all necessary maintenance, B.E.A. decidedearly this year that substantial economies could be obtained by closing the base at Renfrew, and transferring the residue of the work done there tothe new base.4. This is, on the face of it, a matter of normal commercialmanagement for them.    In view, however, of the feelings aroused,Lord Douglas of Kirtleside, Chairman of B.E.A., sought the views of my predecessor, and in May the Ministers concerned discussed this question.5. The Scottish Trade Unions disputed the accuracy of B.E^A..&apos;scalculation of the economies to be obtained.    B.E.A, therefore offeredjointly with the Trade Unions to appoint an independent accountant to review their calculations.    The Trade Unions refused.    BeE.A. nonethelessappointed an Edinburgh accountant, Mr. J.A, Walker to conduct such a review.    The Trade Unions were offered an opportunity to put their case tohim.    This they refused.6. Mr. Walker has now reported.    His conclusions are appended to this paper.    As will be seen, he forms the view that B.E.A.&apos;scalculations are sound, and, indeed, &quot;conservatively made&quot;.7. Constitutionally this is a matter of management for british european Airways.    It is doubtful whether it would be open to me to issue a &quot;general direction&quot; directing them to keep the Renfrew base open,    I haveno other powers that are relevant.Ba On 25th October Lord Douglas, who has shown commendablepatience, wrote to me as follows&quot;We feel that the issue is now crystal clear.A saving to B.E.A. of not less than  800,000 over thenext five years can be confidently forecast if the RenfrewBase is closed and the work transferred to London Airport.-1-
In our view, the only arguments which could lead to the maintenance of the Base in beingwould be those of wider National interests, suchas the preservation of light industry in scotland or strategic reasons.    Were we directed tomaintain the Base open, the Board of B.E0A. wouldbe bound to come back to you and ask for additionalremuneration to the extent of  800,000 over fiveyears in order to meet, uncommerciallys a Nationalrequirement&quot;.B.EoA0 are operating at a loss and in receipt of subsidy fromthe Exchequer.    The loss last year was  If millions, and looks like beingabout  1 million this year.    I am constantly pressing them to improve their financial position by economies and greater efficiency.    It is materialalso to have in mind the fact that subsidies paid to them in respect of ^their deficits are made under legislation due to expire on 31st March, 1956.10, Approximately 600 men are employed at the Renfrew base.If the base moves, 100 men will be  required for minor maintenance work atthe airporto    Employment at London Airport would be offered to 250 others.B,E0A. are offering substantial re-housing grants to staff who accept this offer.11. I should make it clear that it is the maintenance base onlywhose future is in issue,    I am. continuing to operate Renfrew as a civilairport and am opening the fine new terminal buildings, the first completed in this country since the war, on 26th November.    I have also undertaken on that date to see the Scottish Trades Union Council and the Scottish Council (Development of Industry) on the base question.12. The issue for decision is, therefore, whether I should exercise such pressure as I can to induce B.E.A. to maintain a base whosecontinuance is demonsirably commercially unsound.     To do so would in aconsiderable degree frustrate my efforts to secure that they operate in due course at a profit, and would involve treating them in a commercial matter in a way in which a private firm could not be treated.    Although, therefore,Scottish interests would undoubtedly make a row, I do not think this outweighsthe serious consequences of pressing a nationalised industry to act in thisway.13, The Secretary of State for Scotland suggests a postponementwhile the efforts which have been made since May to induce other aircraftinterests to take over part of the maintenance base are continued.    Though I appreciate the Secretary of State&apos;s point, I do not think this proposal wouldbe satisfactory.    In the first place, it is much more difficult to securetenants for these premises when it is not known publicly whether they are going to be vacant.    Secondly, it places B.E.A,, in a position of expensiveuncertainty and would involve a very strong demand from them for paymentof additional subsidy to cover the cost.    Thirdly, though I hope other air-craft work in adequate quantity will be forthcoming for Renfrew, &quot;there is no guarantee of it, and any delay merely holds up at considerable cost a movewhich will have to be made in the end, and which politically may be moredifficult to make then than it is now when we have just been fortified by theassessor&apos;s Report,14. I therefore recommend that a decision be taken that no pressurebe put on BJS.A. to remain, and that I be authorised to tell them this after Ihave seen, on 26th November, the Scottish bodies referred to in paragraph 11.J.A.B -CaMinistry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W.1,12th November, 1954* -2-
ITS&quot;APPENDIXBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSREPORT by JAMES /J&amp;XANDER HALKER, CHARTEREDACCOUNTANT, EDINBURGH on the FDJANCIAL aspect of the PROPOSED TRANSFER of the CORPORATIONSMAINTENANCE BASE at RENFRE1,? to LONDON AIRPORT1. The terras of my remit are   contained in a letter dated 5th August 1954 addressedto me by the Secretary and Solicitor of the Corporation, a copy of which is appended hereto (Appendix &quot;A&quot;).2. I have excluded from my mind any considerations other than financial ones whichmay or may not have a &quot;bearing on the problem, and I have taken cognisance only ofsuch facts as are presently known to me.3. I have carefully perused the Statements prepared by the Corporation and by theTrades Unions side of the National Joint Council for Civil Mr Transport asfollows:-(a) both December 1953 - Statement by the Chief Executive of the Corporation.(b) 1st February 1954 - Statement by the Chief Executive of the Corporation,(c) 21st April 1954 - Trade   Unions side Paper Part I.(d) 21st April 1954- - Trade   Unions side Paper II.(e) 27th April 1 954- - Memorandum by the Chief Executive of the Corporation(Attachment 1 to Board Paper CX (54) 4)*(f) 14th July 1954 - Statement by the Chief Executive of the Corporation. ,(s) 25th August 1954 - Memorandum by the Chief Jlxecutive of the Corporation.Copies of these documents are attached hereto (Appendix &quot;B&quot;).4. I have also perused the Minutes of the Fact-Finding Committee set up by theNational Joint Council for Civil Air Transport dated 11th February 1954*19th February 1954, 26th February 1954, 2nd March 1954, 11th March 1954 and22nd March 1954 respectively.     Copies of these documents are attached hereto(Appendix &quot;C&quot;).5. I have examined the Accounts and Records of the Corporation so far as theseconcerned the subject of my remit and I have discussed the matter under reviewwith the following officials of the Corporation, inter alios:-(a) The Chief ExecutiveCb) The Secretary and Solicitor(c) The Financial Controller(d) The Chief Engineer(e) The Assistant to the Chief Executive(f) The Chief Maintenance Engineer(g) The Personnel Officer, London AirportCh) The Technical Assistant to the Chief Maintenance Engineer(i^ The General Accountant(j) The Cost Accountant(k^ The Planning Superintendent, London Airport(l^ The Accountant, London Airport(m) The Works Manager - Renfrewin) The Senior Personnel Officer for Scotland(o) The Planning Superintendent - Renfrew(p) The Accountant - RenfrewAll Accounts and Records of the Corporation which I desired to examine were madeavailable to me.
I applied my mind to estimates which had &quot;been prepared of the relative costs tothe Corporation of undertaking at Renfrew, or alternatively at London Airport,the following:-(a) Pionair Maintenance(b) Manufacture of Pionair parts for stock(c) Manufacture of parts for modifications(d) Overhaul of all items at present sub-contracted &quot;bythe Corporation.I invited the Trades Unions side of the Rational Joint Council for Civil air transport to supplement, either in writing or orally, the Papers prepared ontheir behalf - see Paragraph 2 (c) and (d).     I was informed, however, by theSecretary of the Trades Unions side that there was nothing further to add tothose Papers and that it was felt unnecessary to send any representative to sub-mit any verbal evidence to me.(a) Dealing with the questions referred to in Paragraph 6 supra I have had nodifficulty whatever in reaching the conclusion that, from the financialangle, a very considerable reduction in expenditure over the next five .years would result to the Corporation if the activities now carried on atRenfrew Maintenance Base were transferred to London Airport.     this conclusion is arrived at on the basis of the estimates prepared by theCorporation covering the calendar years &quot;1955-1959 inclusive.     In myopinion these estimates, so far as I am able to JLidge, have been conserva-tively made and, unless unforeseen circumstances should arise, I see noreason why these economies should not be achieved.(b) The estimated savings which may be expected over the next five   years are summarised in Appendix &quot;D&quot; to this Report, and amount in the aggregateto approximately  800,000.     Details of the estimated savings for the yeax1 955 are provided in Appendix &quot;E&quot; and the estimated additional costs whichwould arise in the first year due to transfer of staff and equipment fromRenfrew to London Airport are shown in Appendix &quot;P&quot;.(c) It will be noted that the estimated savings referred to above apply onlyto the transfer of Pionair Maintenance from Renfrew.     In my opinion theother matters to which I gave my attention, viz. manufacture of Pionairparts for stock, manufacture of parts for modifications and overhaul of items at present sub-contracted by the Corporation have little or no bearing on the main question.(d) It is no doubt true that should It be decided to concentrate these threelast-named activities at Renfrew, a certain.in amount of work would beprovided for Staff presently resident in that area.     I think that thevalue of such work would not be substantial enough to merit serious consideration.     In any case the undertaking by the Corporation of workpresently sub-contracted is bound to be a gradual process.     In addition,it is at least doubtful whether much of this work could be carried out atRenfrew as cheaply as it could be at London Airport, having regard to the&apos; fact that extra costs such as carriage, additional equipment, etc, would be incurred at Renfrew.     It could also be maintained that efficiency wouldbe improved if all such operations were conducted under the same roof andthe same control as the major maintenance of the aircraft concerned.I would refrain from commenting upon the Statements made on behalf of theTrades Unions side of the National Joint Council for Civil Air Transport apartfrom stating that in my opinion these Statements are misleading and that thefinancial conclusions which have been drawn are based on wrong premises.(Sgd.) JAMES A. WALKERCA.8 York Place,18th October. &apos;NOTE:    The Appendices to Mr. Walker?s Report, which are very bulk? and. consistJ     &apos;      mainly of financial statements and statistics, have not been circulated.Copies are available from the Ministry of Transport &amp; Civil Aviation.
