Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954CONFIDENTIALC. (54) 32325th October, 1954CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF THE european coal AND STEEL community memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentOn 5th October, the Cabinet approved, in general terms, the draft agreement and draft Communique annexed to C. (54) 305 (C.C. (54) 63rd Conclusions,Minute 3).2. I have now cleared all outstanding points with the High Authority andI attach the final draft of the proposed Agreement (Annex A).3. I also attach the agreed draft of an Exchange of Letters about the composition of the Council of Association (Annex B) and of a joint Communique(Annex C). Both these documents have been agreed with the High Authority andare intended for publication at the same time as the Agreement.4. Subject to confirmation of these drafts by the Cabinet and by the Councilof Ministers of the Community, it is proposed that the president and two membersof the High Authority should come to London to sign the Agreement during thefirst fortnight of November.5. The only point to which I feel it necessary to draw special attention is thatrelating to reciprocal representation contained in paragraph 10 of the draftCommunique. Her Majesty&apos;s Government established a Delegation at the seat of the High Authority in Luxembourg two years ago and the Delegation was granted diplomatic privileges. The High Authority have now intimated that theywould like to be accorded similar privileges for the Delegation which they proposeto establish in London. The Foreign Secretary has been consulted on this point and agrees that it is not feasible to refuse reciprocal treatment. This will, I am afraid, involve the passage of a short Bill.6.   I accordingly invite my colleagues:   -(a) to authorise the signature of the Agreement, to be accompanied by theExchange of Letters and the joint Communique; and(b) to agree that a Bill granting diplomatic immunities to a Delegation of theHigh Authority in London should be introduced during the next session.D.

ANNEX CJOINT COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THE agreement. From the outset the United Kingdom Government has welcomed the conception of the Schuman Plan, both on account of its contribution to theefficiency and the stability of the basic industries of the countries concerned and onaccount of its contribution to the wider cause of European unity.2. When the European Coal and Steel Community was formed, the UnitedKingdom Government declared its desire to establish an intimate and enduringassociation with the Community, and this declaration was warmly welcomed bythe High Authority.3. As a first step towards this objective the United Kingdom government established relations with the High Authority and on 1st September, 1952 a delegation, headed by Sir Cecil Weir, took up its duties at Luxembourg.4. In view of the substantial progress which has since then been made by theHigh Authority in its task of creating a common market in coal and steel withinthe area of the Community, the United Kingdom Government and the high authority consider that the time has now come to take a further step in thedevelopment of the relations between the United Kingdom and the Community.5. With this object the United Kingdom Government and the high authority have concluded an Agreement to set up a Council of Associationcomposed of four representatives of the United Kingdom Government and fourrepresentatives of the High Authority. In view of the powers and responsibilities in regard to the coal and steel industries of the United Kingdom which have beenconferred by law upon the National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board, therepresentatives of the United Kingdom Government on the Council of Associationwill include one member of the National Coal Board and one member of the Ironand Steel Board.6. The function of the Council of Association will be to provide means forcontinuous consultation in regard to matters of mutual interest relating to coal andsteel and, where appropriate, in regard to the co-ordination of action to deal withthese matters.7. It is recognised that the extent of the benefits to be obtained will inevitably depend upon the extent to which normal trade can flow between theUnited Kingdom and the Community. The Council of Association has therefore been given the duty to examine restrictions and other factors affecting mutualtrade in coal and steel between the two areas, with a view to making such proposalsfor their reduction or elimination as may be agreed for the mutual benefit of theUnited Kingdom and the Community.8. The Agreement also provides a procedure for joint consultation, where necessary, between the United Kingdom Government, the High Authority and theCouncil of Ministers of the Community.9. The Council of Association will pay due regard to the interest of third countries and to the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the othermembers of the Commonwealth.10. The United Kingdom Government will maintain a representation in luxembourg and the High Authority will establish a similar representation inLondon, the grant to whom of any privileges and immunities which may be appropriate being subject to Parliamentary approval. The composition of theUnited Kingdom representation will be determined with due regard to the special responsibilities of the National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board.(Note. This paragraph is subject to the reservation that the UnitedKingdom Cabinet have yet to approve the introduction of new legislation togrant the privileges and immunities in question.)11. Both parties trust that these new arrangements will help to promote a growing association between the United Kingdom and the Community which will,they believe, contribute to their common prosperity and assist in the advancement of European unity.
