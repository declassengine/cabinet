secret.(54) 325 COPY NO. (pC^27th October, 1954CABINETEAST/V/EGT TRADE: STRATEGIC CONTROLS ON SHIPPINGMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation am in full agreement with the views expressed in C. (54) 324 bythe President of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty.My interest is in the sale of second-hand merchant ships on the UnitedKingdom and Colonial registers.     It is an active interest because the bulkof the tonnage purchased by the Russians from this country in recent months has been second-hand.2.   The ability to sell second-hand ships abroad has always been a matterof importance to our mercantile marine.    Such sales provide our shipownerswith a significant part of funds needed to build new ships and thus are ofindirect benefit to our shipbuilding industry.     There should be nounnecessary or avoidable restriction on the ability of our shipowners to sellabroad at a time when every effort is needed to modernise our mercantilefleet.3.   Taken together, the proposals put forward by the Consultative group are objectionable to us for commercial reasons and seemingly difficult todefend on strategic grounds.     It does not make sense to suggest that there arestrategic dangers if British ships steaming 15-^ knots are sold to the Russians,but none if these ships are sold to them by the Danes.    Nor can wo defendat the same time a quota which places this country, the largest exporter ofships, on the level of our smallest competitor - or possibly even below itwhen account is taken of the proposed exemption of trade agreements alreadyentered into.    If we accepted the scheme  I have little doubt that our ship-owners would lend weight and support to the criticisms that will be made bythe shipbuilding industry.4.   It is not at all clear what is the balance of advantage on strategicgrounds between the new proposals and the existing procedure.    Thepolitical objections are, however, obvious and, in my view, are decisive.I therefore support the line taken by the President and the First Lord, andfor my part I should prefer to take our stand on the conclusion inparagraph 14 of their paper, rather than adopt the alternative inparagraph 15.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.26th October, 1954;
