secret. (54) 33911th November, 1954CABINETDAVEY PAXMAN &amp; CO. LTD.Memorandum by the Postmaster general it is proposed that the attached statement should be made in both Housestoday.2. The subject of the statement has been considered by the Home AffairsCommittee (H.A. (54) 25th Meeting, Item 3 and H.A. 26th Meeting, Item 1).Briefly the position is that from 1st June, 1954, when Part 1 of the wireless telegraphy Act 1949 was brought into operation, all our charges for radio licenceshave had full statutory authority. But the Attorney General advises that this isnot the case in respect of some charges made under the old Wireless TelegraphyAct, 1904. He therefore proposes to submit to judgment on a test claim to be heardon Monday, 15th November, that charges for a land mobile radio licence had no statutory authority.3. The amount involved in all the land mobile licences is about  120,000;but what is far more serious, is that the Attorney General advises that the legality of the charge for broadcast receiving licences under the 1904 Act could be questioned. The repayment of charges for land mobile licences would not therefore remove the risk of a corresponding claim in respect of broadcast receivinglicences which might amount to  75-100 millions.4. The Home Affairs Committee has recommended that all past payments should be validated by a Bill, and that an announcement of our intention be made before the case comes up on Monday.D.General Post Office, E.C. 1.11th November, 1954.DRAFT statement with Your Lordships&apos; permission,With your permission Mr. Speaker and that of the House, I should like to makea statement about radio licences.As a result of certain recent developments doubt has arisen as to the legality of charges made for certain classes of licence under the Wireless Telegraphy act of 1904, including Broadcast Receiving Licences and Mobile Radio Licences.The Government propose to remove any doubt there may be by introducing legislation to validate charges made on all licences under the 1904 Act. For future and current licences the matter has been clarified in the Wireless Telegraphy act of 1949.Copy No. 66*    -47136Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954
