Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRETC. (54) 34012th November, 1954CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1954-55 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Cabinet, on 20th October, agreed to appoint a Committee under my chairmanship &quot; to examine in detail the proposals for legislation in the next session,including legislation to replace emergency powers, and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet&quot; (C.C. (54) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5). On28th October the Cabinet approved this Committee&apos;s interim recommendation that the powers of economic control conferred by Defence Regulation 55 andassociated Regulations should be narrowed, not by legislation, but by Order inCouncil (C.C. (54) 71st Conclusions, Minute 1). I now submit the Committee&apos;sfinal recommendations about legislation in the next session.Proposed programme . The Committee have closely scrutinised the case for including in theprogramme each of the Bills referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of C. (54) 310 and,where necessary, have discussed the matter with the Minister responsible. Theyhave similarly examined the case for certain further measures whose claims havebeen brought before them. In the light of these detailed investigations they now recommended the inclusion of the following Bills in the programme:  BILLS RECOMMENDED FOR INCLUSION IN THE PROGRAMMEArmy and Air Force (3 Bills).*British Transport Commission (Borrowing).Cocos Islands.* Colonial Development and Welfare.* County Court Jurisdiction.*Herring Industry.*Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions).Isle of Man (Customs).National Service.New Towns (Money).Northern Ireland:  Governors Emoluments.*Qil Pollution.Pakistan (Consequential Provision).*Pensions and National Insurance.Public Works Loans.Rating and Valuation.*Road Traffic.*Rural Roads (Wales).Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage.*South Lancashire Criminal Courts.* Sugar Industry.Wireless Telegraphy.Scottish Bills* Crofters.Food and Drugs.47134   -Copy No.   g Q
The Committee ,agreed to recommend that certain of these Bills should be specifically referred to in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. the bills in the above list!which are so referred to in the draft of the Speech circulatedunder cover of C. (54) 342 are marked thus *.3: The Committee further recommend that the following additional bills should be prepared for introduction on the understanding that decisions- whether any or all of them should be introduced should be taken at a later stage in thelight of the situation as it develops:  BILLS RECOMMENDED FOR PREPARATIONAliens in Crown Service.Copyright.Inventions and Designs (Defence):Water.4. The only Bills in the above lists which appear to call for special commentare the following:  Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions)The Committee favoured the promotion of a single Bill to deal with.:. (a) requisitioned houses;(b) temporary houses;(c) the compensation to be payable to owner-occupiers of houses covered bya slum clearance Order.The Cabinet on 28th July approved in principle the promotion of separate bills to deal with (a) and (b) above (C.C. (54) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5, Conclusion (2)-and Minute 8, Conclusion (1) )i The Minister of Housing is now seeking, theapproval of the Home Affairs Committee for his proposals under (c).Rating, and ValuationThe Committee recognised that April 1956* would almost certainly have to be adhered to as the date for the new valuation and. that, if it were, this Bill wouldhave to be passed during the course of the next session. They, therefore, agreedto recommend that the Bill should be included in the programme but that theGovernment should avoid any final commitment in the matter by not referring tothe Bill in the Queen&apos;s Speech.Sugar IndustryOur obligations under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement mean that legislation is necessary before state trading in sugar can be abandoned and theLondon Terminal Sugar Market can. be re-opened. The Committee recognised that both these objects were in line with general Government policy and would be toour economic advantage. They were informed that the Economic PolicyCommittee favoured legislation but took the view that, in order to avoidantagonizing Government supporters, this should not extend to altering the structure of the British Sugar Corporation. The Committee agreed to recommendthat legislation on this limited basis should be included&apos; in the programme.CopyrightThe President of the Board of Trade and&apos; the Postmaster-General joined in pressing the urgent claims of a comprehensive Bill which would:  (a) deal with the recommendations of the Copyright Committee;(b) enable the United Kingdom to ratify two international. CopyrightConventions;(c) confer on televising authorities a copyright in television programmes,particularly sporting events.
n1*40 ^The Committee considered that some legislation on copyright would almost certainly be necessary in the next session but that the Government should not commit themselves at this stage to a comprehensive measure or, in particular, tofurther legislation affecting television. They, therefore, agreed to recommend that legislation should be prepared but that it should not be referred to; in The Queen&apos;sSpeech. .      ?&apos;.;7 0iJ-.ft,-; ii v:A t&amp;wqxiq fxi iAvWeight of the programme. Four of the Bills referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of C. (54) 310 are not now recommended for inclusion in the programme. Of these the most important is the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill. The Committee were informed that it was now proposed that an entirely new pension scheme for teachers should be negotiated and that the negotiations were unlikely to be completed in time for legislation to be brought forward in the next Session. The Chancellor of theExchequer made it clear that he would feel bound to emphasise to the Cabinet,when the matter came before them, the difficulties in the way of a solution to theproblem on these lines. The Committee agreed to recommend that the present bill should not be included in the programme, but that The Queen&apos;s Speech should contain a suitable indication of the Governments intentions in general terms.5. The Committee agreed that time would not be available for the DentistsBill, and they were informed that the Minister of Works did not now wish toproceed with the Tube Shelters Bill. The Expiring Laws Continuance Bill may beexpected to have become law before the end of the present Session.6. The lightening of the programme by the elimination of these four Bills hasto some extent been offset by fresh additions to it. Thus, Bills on the CocosIslands, County Court Jurisdiction and Wireless Telegraphy are now included, andthe scope of the proposed housing legislation is likely to be extended. On balance,therefore, the Committee have not found it possible to reduce appreciably theburden of legislation for the next session, in spite of the recognised need to relax,so far as possible, the strain on our supporters in Parliament.Conclusions7.   On behalf of the Committee I now invite the Cabinet:  (i) to approve the inclusion in the programme of the Bills listed in paragraph above.(ii) to authorise the preparation of the Bills listed in paragraph 3 on theunderstanding that decisions whether or not any or all of them shouldbe introduced in the next Session will have to be taken later in the lightof the situation as it develops.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,11th November, 1954.
