Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1954SECRET Copy No. 74C. (54) 31921st October, 1954CABINET&quot;v   Cyprus memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am increasingly disturbed about the international aspect of some recentCyprus developments.2. I told the Greek Prime Minister in August of last year that this subject wasnot discussable between us. In my understanding that is still the position of her majesty&apos;s Government.3. In the light of this and our declared policy, we have fought a stout fightat the United Nations. Though we lost on numbers, we certainly won on qualityin our battle there. All the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries supportedus save only Greece herself, Iceland and the United States. We therefore face the next round there with greater confidence.4. But now there has come the visit of the Archbishop Makarios, which Iam afraid has done us much harm. The Greek Ambassador spoke with concern to the Foreign Office about this. (See Annex A.) It was also unfortunate that the archbishop&apos;s arrival almost coincided with the Governors. Since then he hasbeen gratified by his broadcast exchange, and I understand that he was in theGallery yesterday when Mr. Driberg was pressing the Prime Minister about theword &quot; never.&quot;5. Meanwhile the Greek wireless is indulging in a torrent of abuse which wedo not report, and to most of which we do hot retort. Some choice examples are attached Annex B. The Greeks are also indulging in a campaign against theGreek Cypriots who are loyal to us.6.   Meanwhile Papagos, the Greek Prime Minister, is on a visit to Franco.7. I must place on record my own view that the Turks will never agree to cyprus being handed over to Greece. On the other hand, if they think we arelikely to give way to Greece, we must expect a demand from Turkey for the return of the island, which they ceded to us. If we are firm, the Turks will back us. Ifwe appear to yield, they will at once put in their own demands. It is therefore essential that we should continue to be firm. If we are firm, I am sure that we shallwin through.8. I think the Cabinet should consider whether some further statementreaffirming our position is not called for without delay. This would help to counter the Archbishop&apos;s arrival in New York.A. E.Foreign Office, SWA.20th October, 1954.46998B
ANNEX a record by Mr. G. W. Harrison, Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the ForeignOffice, of his conversation with M. Mostras, the Greek Ambassador, on18th October, 1954CyprusThe Greek Ambassador (who spoke in strict confidence and for obvious reasons should not be quoted) said he was extremely worried about the activitiesof Archbishop Makarios. He was seeing a considerable number of political figures and M. Mostras was afraid that he might be getting a dangerously wrongimpression. The Leader of the Liberal Party, for example, was telling him thatof course something must be done about Cyprus. Prominent Labour politicianswere leaving him with the impression that, if they were returned to power, therewould be a complete change of policy. Even phil-Hellene Conservative M.P.s,no doubt out of politeness, were making sympathetic noises. The result was thatthe Archbishop, who is naturally only too anxious to hear this kind of thing, iselated and is telegraphing what M. Mostras regards as unduly optimistic messages to Athens, New York and elsewhere. M. Mostras fears that not only will thismake M. Kyrou, the Greek Delegate to the United Nations, and his associates moreintransigent than ever, but is also laying up seeds of future trouble.2. M. Mostras said in this connection that he had asked prominent Labourpoliticians what exactly the Scarborough resolution meant. He was told it meant that, if Labour were returned to power, they would at once introduce a liberalconstitution with the prospect, in 15 or possibly 10 years, of the Cyprlots being given the opportunity of determining their own future inside or outside theCommonwealth. M. Mostras said that, knowing what Labour leaders had said in the past, he felt that this was a more probable forecast of future Labour policythan the Archbishop&apos;s impression of an immediate plebiscite and hand over to greece.ANNEX B1. Broadcasts to Cyprus on Athens RadioA.: 12th August, 1954&quot; . . . . The hitherto reticent Armitage decided to open his mouth to the full;his articles and interviews follow one another.....the man believes that in thisway he will succeed in making black white, and that the Cyprus. people will automatically be turned into puppets who will start doing what the simple mindedArmitage dreams . . . . and when, and very soon now, the Cyprus people are free and the Greek flag flies alone and proud over the whole of the island, we shallagain remind him of what he has lost and what he has gained. We shall alsoremind him how right we were when we told him that when Greeks fight fortheir freedom no force can stop them.  But then it will perhaps be too late.&quot;B.-15th August, 1954&quot; . . . . The intellectuals of Greece proclaim that so long as Cyprus is under british rule they will keep inspiring the Greek people with hatred of Britain, andthe teachers swear to pour into the students&apos; souls the poison of hatred of Britain.&quot;C.-20th August, 1954&quot;. . . . My enslaved Brothers, the battle has started. Today all the newspapers are faithful to the struggle and you can see whole pages depictingthe Greek flag with Cyprus enfolded in it.....the general slogan is: &apos; Cyprusis ours! At the present moment we Greeks have all achieved the feelings of a soldier in the hour of battle, but this time the battle is being waged for union withour beloved island. &quot;
&quot; Arise O heroic Cyprus, the hour of your freedom is come! Arise, beloveddaughter, your bonds are beginning to break. As the moment of the appeal for your deliverance approaches so does the emotion of the Greek people work up toa climax. For we all feel that matters have reached a stage where agreements of expediency and delays cannot be tolerated. The hour of fate has struck. now or never!&quot; . . . . You must remain calm and rally yourselves round your worthyEthnarch. Do not be afraid of the terroristic laws. These laws have been made,but they have done nothing more than cover those who ordered them with ridicule.For as Montesquieu says in his famous &apos; Grandeur and Decadence of the Romans,&apos;there is no worse tyranny than that imposed under the guise of an alleged legality.There is no example in history when such laws have been successful. Themediaeval feudalists in Cyprus and the local traitors have forbidden the wordEnosis. Let our enslaved brothers listen to their radios at 18-30 and they willhear the mighty answer of the Greek people as well as this forbidden word.&quot;D. 1st September, 1954Referring to the argument that there are many Cypriots who are against Enosisbut who are afraid to say so,&quot;. . . . Those &apos; many &apos; people must surely be the criminally bad Greeks; infact, a handful of infernal types like those whom the British created in the IonianIslands in order to perpetuate their occupation. It is indeed strange that thosepractical people, as they are, have not derived any lessons from that period and continue in the same way.&quot;E.-7th September, 1954Referring again to Cypriot &quot; traitors,&quot;&quot;. . . . The Governor of Cyprus, Armitage, having failed to effect aconference of local representatives of the Cypriot people and notables of the islandfor the examination of the proposal for a Colonial constitution is now indulgingin secret contacts with certain persons who he is trying to influence in return forwell-known exchanges to make them renounce their homeland and agree to theenlisting of their names as traitors to their country by those of John Kliridis andPaul Pavlidis and two or three others who will remain stigmatised in the pagesof Greek history.....If Armitage succeeds in finding five or ten evil spiritsin the midst of the human sea of 4,500 patriots he will render the Cypriot peoplea great service because the world must at least know whom it must point to astraitors to its holy struggle for freedom at the moment when the humble andwretched peasants and workers and the other worthy Cypriots do not hesitate to sacrifice everything for this sacred ideal.&quot;F.-20th September, 1954With further reference to Cypriot &quot; traitors,&quot;&quot;.....The only exception (to those who support Enosis) are the three or four traitors who try to perpetuate the enslavement of their country under theBritish yoke in exchange for fat salaries which are nothing but pieces of silver fortheir treachery. Theirs is the London ostriches&apos; only argument to prove that theCypriot people do not want Enosis. But all the world knows that such fatherland-denying big-wigs as the Government Councillors Paul Pavlidis and John Kliridishave long ceased to be numbered among genuine Cypriots. In order to securejobs with the Attorney-General they betrayed a struggling and heroic Cypriotpeople. They may be sure that they will enter history along side the traitors likePausanias and Ephialtes, whereas honour will come to those patriots whose lot itmay be to be arrested, imprisoned and even executed because they are not afraidto risk their lives so that the country may live for freedom.....   The represen-tatives of foreign nations .... take no notice of certain treacherous voices of afew renegade Greeks like the notorious Sossidis, official Secretary of the LancasterBranch of the Anglo-Greek Union, who will remain on the list of stigmatisedtraitors in the conscience of every genuine Greek for his attack on the Ethnarchwho (he said), &quot; rejecting British liberalism dares to carry out anti-british propaganda and to terrorise the Cypriots so that they prefer a doubtful futureunder Greek administration to their present well being &quot;.&quot;
G.-23rd September, 1954&quot; .... If by any chance the U.N. Steering Committee decides not toinclude the Cyprus issue on the Agenda it is considered certain that, instead oftriumphal meetings, there will be, despite the ban and the oppressive measures,meetings and demonstrations in which Cypriot people will express their greatbitterness and will complain vigorously. Resolutions and cables will be sent tothe U.N. Secretary-General and to the Delegations which will not onlyrecord the Cypriot people&apos;s bitterness and dissatisfaction, but will also repeattheir insistent demand that the U.N. General Assembly should finally decide to include the issue in its Agenda. There is now no doubt that the Cypriotpeople are determined to make every sacrifice to demand and obtain their freedom.&quot;H. 5th October, 1954Addressing the Governor of Cyprus,&quot;. . . . Only a few months have passed since that notorious period when youthreatened the unhappy Cypriot people whose friendly co-operation you are now seeking hinting this time that the proffered constitution will be acceptable to them.You know quite well that, with the exception of the notorious traitors, Kliridis andPavlidis, and five or six others who have sold their souls and their glorious countryto the devil, you will find no other true Cypriot that is true Greek who woulddishonour his name and that of his family before history. And when the gallantpeople of Cyprus celebrate their freedom the renegades will be compelled to takerefuge in Britain where they will find only the contempt of the proud british people, because no one has ever cared for traitors.&quot;2. The following is a text of a letter received by the Commissioner,Nicosia/Kyrenia, at the time of the Coronation:  &quot; Kyrenia,Sir, 18th June, 1953.I wish to put the following facts before you and to request that you willforward this letter to His Excellency the Governor.I am a Cypriot and ex-Serviceman and served in the British Army from1941 to 1943 during which time I was wounded. I am a loyal British subject and as such I decorated my stall in the market in honour of Her Majesty the queen&apos;s Coronation. I received first prize in the competition for the bestdecorated shop.The Bishop of Kyrenia sent for me and informed me that should I getmarried and have any children, he would not baptise them nor would he buryany of my family. He has also given instructions that Cypriots are not to tradewith me at my stall.I wish to protest strongly against the conduct of the Bishop and to request that His Excellency will take the necessary steps to protect a patriotic british subject from such persecution.(Signed) SAVVAS N. RIALAS.&quot;This letter provides a striking and useful refutation of the claim made byArchbishop Makarios when he was interviewed on the B.B.C. Home Service on15th October that the Church did not use religious pressure to induce Cypriots to toe the Enosis line.
