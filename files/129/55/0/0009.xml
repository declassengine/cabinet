secret.(52) 30926TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETTHE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ORDER 1951Memorandum by the Chancellor of. the exchequer wish to comment on the Minister of Labour&apos;s memorandum C.(52) 303about the amendment which he wishes to make to the Industrial Disputes Order,1951 (Order 1376) about the position of professional organisations.2. I fully recognise that the general principle of compulsory arbitrationis an essential part of the country&apos;s industrial machinery.   What I doubt most strongly is whether the compulsory arbitration procedure of the industrial disputes Tribunal is suitable for settling the salaries of very highly paidprofessional staff.3. There is to my mind something repugnant in the idea of the managerialgrades taking the employer to compulsory arbitration and the objections areeven stronger in the case of the public services, where the Exchequer pays part,if not all, of the salaries.   The Order would not in form bind the Crown, but if itwere passed I should find it extremely difficult to avoid compulsory arbitrationfor the most senior grades in the Civil Service, who have, up to now, been excludedfrom the Civil Service compulsory arbitration procedure.4. Not only is the general idea repugnant, but the procedure of the industrial disputes Tribunal is also, I think, unsuitable for settling the complicated issues arising from the remuneration of the most senior staff.   The Tribunals mainfunction is to settle industrial wage claims of a straightforward nature.5, The Minister suggests that there is no real danger of the seniorprofessional classes resorting to the Tribunal.   No claims from such classesmaterialised from 1940 to 1951.   I cannot be so confident.   Until recently it has notbeen the practice, or even the desire, of managerial staff to have their remunerationsettled by arbitration, but in the last few years the attitude of the professionalclasses has altered and the Danckwerts award has been a most powerful stimulus to other professional classes to use this procedure.6. If I am right, the Minister&apos;s proposal may result in a series of Danck-werts awards to the senior professional classes.  As I pointed out in C.(52) 190, suchawards will set up a dangerous chain reaction, particularly if the consultants areincluded in the process.   There would be bound to be repercussions in the Uni-universities, in the local Government service and in the higher Civil Service,7. Finally, with respect to the Minister of Labour, large increases givento the most highly paid professional classes would be most dangerous to the wage restraint policy.   Industrial workers will not be content with a 10/- increaseif they see the  2,000 man getting an award of  10 a week.COPY NO._^Lf:
8. For all these reasons, while I recognise the Minister of Labour&apos;difficulties, I think that in amending Order 1376 he should provide thatcompulsory access to the Tribunal would not be given to those earningmore than, say,  1,500 a year.I?- .A.
