(t-his document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret.(52) 346COPY NO. /O720TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTRANSPORT bill memorandum by the. Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and power the Transport Policy Committee have been giving furtherconsideration to the provisions of the Transport Bill and expect shortly to propose substantial amendments in it.The object of this note is to put before my colleagues someconsiderations which they may wish to have in mind when coming to adecision on such proposals.2. If Part II of the levy (i. e. the part of it which depends uponfuture transfers of traffic from rail to road) has to be dropped owingto lack of public support and active opposition by trade and industry,the main possible courses of action seem to be as follows:-(a)  To proceed with the Bill without Part II of the levyThis would have to be defended on the ground that the reorganisedrailways, given wide freedom in charges, could hold their own againstroad transport.The Bill if so amended would probably be criticised on thefollowing grounds :-(i) that the idea of integration had been abandoned and nothingconstructive put in its place;(ii) that while there was something to be said for the proposition that trade and industry as a whole should pay the reasonablecost of the transport services, both road and rail, which they require, including the cost to the Commission of returning itsroad haulage undertaking to private enterprise as part of thenew system, it is indefensible to ask the C Licencee to bear the great bulk of the cost of this return as an isolated project;(iii)  that if the Government believe that rail could hold its own against. road they cannot expect offers for road transport units to be readily forthcoming.   If on the other hand the railways (as manybelieve) will not be able to compete successfully with roadeven with wider freedom to vary their charges, letting the hauliersloose would result in the railways getting into financial difficulties from which they could be extricated only by state assistance or by excessive charges for those traffics whichmust go by rail.
(iv)  that shorn of inessentials the Bill as so amendedwould amount to little more than the forcedsale of public assets to private enterprise ata very considerable loss which in the mainwould have to be met by the L. Licencee.(The railways could be reorganised without aBill.    The scheme making powers of theCommission in regard to road passenger transport and trade harbours are moribundalready and even the increased freedom of charge for the railways could have been allowed by the Transport Tribunal under acharges scheme if they thought it justified. )(b) To drop Part II of the levy and to dispose of only a fixedfraction of the Commission^ road haulage undertakingIt would be impossible to find a reasonable basis for determination-ing the content of the fraction.    What the Commission would want to sellhauliers would not want to buy and vice versa.    No impartial body could fairly be asked to carve out such a fraction.Apart from the practical difficulties there seem to be insufficient grounds for defending such a proposition.(c) To leave the Road Haulage Executive&apos;s undertaking withthe Commission, drop both parts of the levy and remove the 25 mile limit immediately on this basis the railways would still get their increased freedomof charge and the proposed relaxation of the licensing system forhauliers&apos; vehicles would remain.This could be defended on the ground -(i)  that the railways will in future be able to hold theirown against road (see (a) above);(ii) that those who believe in nationalisation should notshrink from exposing the Road haulage executive to competition from privateenterprise, especially as they now have along start so far as traffic beyond the25 mile limit is concerned;(iii) that the Road Haulage Executive would not be putunder any obligation that did not apply to theprivate haulier.Proposals on these lines might well commend themselves totrade and industry, the hauliers and a considerable section of publicopinion. It has however to be borne in mind that a possible courseof events if they were adopted would be -(i) neither the railways nor the Road Haulage Executivewould be able to stand up to competition from thefree hauliers;
In this connection the Chairman of the Commissionin a letter to the Minister of 16th Octoberdealing with the charging powers of the railwaysmakes the following statement:-However this may be, the Commission wishto make it clear that, in their view, so long asuncontrolled private road hauliers remain free to pick and choose what they will carry, and toleave to the railways the responsibility ofproviding a public service which will meet alldemands at all times, the consequences are bound to fall on other users of the services or,alternatively and in the last resort, on theExchequer through the operation of theguarantee.    Even the proposed alleviationof railway disabilities, the value of which theCommission do not underrate, does not removethis fundamental inequality. &quot;;(ii) the Road Haulage Executive would run at an increasing loss and get into financial and perhaps operating difficulties.    (So muchso that it would probably be desirable toprovide that the Commission should have powers to dispose of parts of their road haulage undertaking if they considered this expedient);(iii)   any future Labour Government might be tempted toreimpose the 25 mile limit (and at the same timeto restrict the freedom of the C Licencee).    Onthe other hand proposals on these lines wouldinvolve a minimum of interference with thenationalized undertaking set up by the 1947 Actand would to that extent make it easier for theopposition to accept it (although not in public)as a compromise which they would not upsetunless on genuine grounds of public interest.3. The course of action outlined in paragraph 2(c) above mayin present circumstances be the best one to adopt.L.Great George Street, S. W, 1.20TH OCTOBER, 1952.
