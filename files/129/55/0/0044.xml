(TH^S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 344 COPY NOv18TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETEMERGENCY LAWS (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILLEMPLOYMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED forces on URGENT WORK OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCEMemorandum by the Home secretary i desire to bring to the attention of my colleagues a difference ofopinion which has arisen between the Minister of Labour and myself on theprovisions of the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.   It wasconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee on 16th October and there were also differences of opinion in that Committee.   The Bill which was preparedby the Emergency Legislation Committee under my Chairmanship was approvedby the Home Affairs Committee, subject to the submission to the Cabinet ofthe point which is in dispute (H.A. (52) 27th Meeting, Minute 1).2. Paragraph 5 of the first schedule to the Emergency Laws (miscellaneous provisions) Bill would make permanent the provisions of Regulation 6 of theDefence (Armed Forces) Regulations which authorise the Admiralty, the ArmyCouncil and the Air Council to employ Service personnel on agricultural work or other urgent work of national importance.   Without these provisions therewould be no authority for employing Servicemen to assist in maintainingessential supplies and services in emergencies, including those arising from industrial disputes, unless there was a formal Proclamation of an Emergencyunder the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.   It has been found by experience sincethe war that there are occasions where it is essential to use troops but whereit would not be expedient to proclaim a formal emergency.   The Departmentsconcerned with maintaining essential supplies consider it necessary to maintainthese provisions in force, and the Minister of Labour agrees that they must becontinued for the present and may well be required permanently.   The differencebetween us is as to the footing on which they should be continued after10th December next.3. The Regulation in question, which is continued under the supplies and Services Acts, will expire after 10th December unless continued in some form or other.   It has in recent years been continued from year to year byOrder in Council under the Supplies and Services Acts, and the Minister ofLabour suggests that that procedure should be followed again on this occasion.My view is that, since it is clear that these provisions will be reqitired for asfar ahead as we can see, they should be included in the Emergency Laws(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.   This would mean that while the defence regulation would be continued temporarily by Order in Council from10th December next it would be replaced by the provisions of the EmergencyLaws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill when the latter became law and theprovisions would then have permanent effect.4. The Minister of Labour considers that in view of the present situationin industry it would be a mistake to introduce provisions to make this regulation permanent.   He thinks that they might well be contentious and that
liftthe occasion would certainly provide an opportunity for making politicalcapital.   In my view no better opportunity for making these Regulationspermanent is likely to arise.   As my colleagues will be aware, the emergency legislation Committee have been endeavouring in accordance with our publicpromises3 to clear up the tangle of emergency laws and regulations byensuring that those for which a strong case cannot be made out are dropped and that those which are required permanently are given statutory form.The only Regulations which we intend to continue in their present form arethose which are residual and would without doubt cease to be required in thenot distant future and those representing the basis of the main economic controls which we intend to have replaced by Statutes renewable annuallywhen the difficulties of drafting such Statutes have been overcome and a placehas been found for the Bills in the legislative programme.   Regulation of the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations clearly falls into the category of those which would be required permanently and in accordance with theprinciples set out above its provisions should be included in the EmergencyLaws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is to make permanent thoseRegulations for which there is a continuing need.5. I appreciate that there may be contention and that the opportunitymay be taken to make political capital.   I cannot think, however, that there ismore risk of such trouble on this occasion than there is likely to be in future,and if we defer tackling this problem so that it has to be faced on a lateroccasion we shall probably increase the risk of trouble.   Making the Regulationpermanent now can be represented as part of the clearing-up process;  if itwere dealt with in isolation later on it would be more open to attack on political grounds and possibly less easy to defend.   The use of troops for maintaining essential supplies and services under this Regulation was resortedto by the Labour Administration on a number of occasions with almostuniversal approval and it will therefore not be easy for them to criticise the proposal.   Furthermore, it should not be overlooked that these powersenable troops to be used not only on occasions where there is an industrial dispute but on other urgent work of national importance, including occasionsof civil emergency caused by natural disasters, such as those, for instance,occasioned by floods.   In the absence of these special powers it would not bepossible to require troops to perform such functions which are outside thescope of their military duties.6. I hope therefore that my colleagues will agree that we should proceedwith the proposal to make these provisions permanent in the EmergencyLaws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.D. M. F.Home Office, S. W. 1. ,18TH OCTOBER, 1952.
