STCABINET OFFICE. RECORDS SECTION(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAXESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)I confidential. (52) 325 COPY NO.      ol8th OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETDEVELOPMENT CHARGE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.After the Cabinefs meeting on 1st October the Prime minister asked me to discuss this question with the Ministers principally concerned.This I have done.   We are now agreed on the following points(i) The . 300 millions should not be distributed next year.(ii) We could not advance the proposition that all land should in future be bought and sold at its current market value(C. (52) 312) without reviving all the old politicalcontroversies over land values.   It would not be possibleto revive these now - especially as we, in Opposition,supported the principles of the 1947 Act and challengedonly the arbitrary figure of  300 millions.(iii) Compensation for land compulsorily acquired or compulsorilysterilised should be paid, as and when each case arises,at existing use value plus the 1947 claim0(iv) Development Charge should not be payable in full on landfor which planning permission to develop is granted.2. The sole remaining issue for decision by the Cabinet is whetherDevelopment Charge should be abolished altogether or whether it should bereduced.   If it is merely to be reduced, we consider that it should be reducedto 50%.   The alternatives are:-(i) to adopt the proposals put forward by the Minister of housing (C. (52) 304) including the abolition of development charge;  or(ii) to introduce legislation providing for (i) and (iii) of thepreceding paragraph, and to reduce Development Charge by regulation to 50%.3. The arguments on either side have been fully stated in the earlier discussions.   We invite the Cabinet to decide which of these alternativesis preferable.A.E.:Foreign Office, S.W.1,8th OCTOBER, 1952.
