CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    gC. (52) 34820th October, 1952CABINETAGRICULTURAL MARKETING BOARDS AND THE MONOPOLIESCOMMISSIONMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Government should support producer marketing boards because (a) it is pledged to do so;(b) they can stimulate efficiency in agricultural production and marketing;(c) the agricultural industry believes in them and their existence will promoteconfidence and so help the production drive.2. There is a point in dispute between the President of the Board of Tradeand myself which I must refer to my colleagues, viz., whether marketing boards should be within the scope of the Monopolies Commission. Postponement of the monopolies Bill has not enabled me to postpone this issue, as urgent decisions mustbe taken on agricultural marketing.3. Boards can have wide powers of control, and agricultural products are of vital importance. It is accepted that powerful safeguards for the public interestare necessary and indeed existed pre-war. To these, Ministerial powers to servedirections were added in 1949.4. These safeguards only operate effectively after the event. I therefore propose yet further safeguards: (a) Prior notice of certain proposed restrictiveactions (e.g., price fixing; regulations of supplies); and (b) the setting up Of anindependent Marketing Council to advise Ministers; to enable views of all con-cerned to be heard; and to help to avoid political pressure. The Council could also advise on wider marketing problems such as the desirability of new schemes.If proposed actions were against the public interest, Agriculture Ministers could,if necessary use their powers of direction under the 1949 Act.5. I am discussing with the Minister of Food this general idea and its applica-tion to particular schemes, three of which have been before us since we took office.The Minister of Food is doubtful whether the safeguards proposed are adequate for Boards handling basic commodities such as milk, but I think we shall be readyto give the promoters our agreed views on at least one of these schemes (applesand pears) in two or three weeks.6. In spite of the safeguards I propose the President of the Board of Tradeconsiders that Marketing Boards should also be subject to the monopolies commission.  I understand his difficulties to be:  (i) The Governments announced intention of bringing nationalised industrieswithin the scope of the monopolies legislation rests on the principle thatno monopoly should enjoy a privileged status under the legislationmerely because it has a statutory basis. Whatever the merits of any existing or new safeguards in the agricultural marketing field, it wouldbe unfortunate as a matter of political presentation if the Governmentwere to appear to be proposing an exception to this principle in the caseof producer-controlled marketing boards. This would probably leadto demands for a similar exemption for the nationalised industries andthe whole principle of bringing statutory monopolies within theCommission^ purview might be jeopardised.Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952
(ii) He may want to refer to the Commission general issues such as therestriction of persons through whom products may be sold, which cannotbe fully considered without covering the field of agricultural marketing.(iii) He cannot see that the producers&apos; interests would have any valid ground for objecting to formal consistency of treatment. The power to refer to the Monopolies Commission would never be used without the agree-ment of Agriculture Ministers (or the sanction of Ministers collectively). and any remedial action following a report of the Commission wouldbe a matter for Agriculture Ministers.7. On the other hand the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of Foodconsider that:  (a) Boards need more safeguards than the Monopolies Commission (whichwould operate in a general way after the event) can provide. My pro-posals provide for specific action before the event.(b) My proposals would meet the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s require-ment under 6 (ii) above because any independent body under my pro-posals would work in close contact and I hope have overlapping mem-membership with the Monopolies Commission. Further in considering anygeneral reference of the kind mentioned the Monopolies commission would be entitled and expected to enlist the help of the independent body.(c) On the President^ points at 6 (i) above we have to reconcile our policieson monopolies and agriculture. The Agriculture Ministers are deeply committed to support all agricultural marketing boards. It will bedifficult enough to get agreement to our proposals for additional safe-guards though I have reason to think that we shall get it. I am satisfiedthat we should never get it for them and for the Monopolies Commis-sion as well, and that the farmers&apos; representatives would not be content to accept the formal consistency agreement advanced in 6 (iii).id) In reply to any Opposition criticism the President can argue that the formerGovernment did not consider it desirable in providing additional safe-guards in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1949 to make marketing boards subject to the Monopolies Commission.8. I invite my colleagues&apos; authority to proceed with discussions with the farmers&apos; representatives on establishment or revival of marketing boards on theunderstanding that such additional safeguards as may be agreed beforehand withthe Minister of Food will take the place of direct subjection of Agricultural Market-ing Boards to the Monopolies Commission.T. L. D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,20th October, 1952.
