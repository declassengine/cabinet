(52) 3268th October, 1952CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION: UNITED states air BASES IN DENMARKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsProblemThe Danish Ambassador told me on 29th September that, the danish government were considering a proposal that United States fighter bases shouldbe established in Denmark and that they were disposed to agree. I had alreadyheard about this proposal from the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who visitedLondon at the end of June. M. Kraft told me then that there would be two suchbases, on each of which a wing of American fighter aircraft would be stationed.The air-fields are not likely to be completed before the end of 1953, but, in orderthat the cost of their construction can be paid for out of N.A.T.O. funds, the danish government are required to give an undertaking that fighters can be stationed on them in peace time.2. Count Reventlow stated that his Government were anxious for the viewsof Her Majesty&apos;s Government and I told him that I could not give a definite replywithout consulting my colleagues. Speaking personally, however, I felt sure thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government would not want to discourage the Danish government from agreeing to this proposal. It seemed to me, moreover, that it might bepossible to argue that it was less provocative to have American fighters in Denmarkthan American strategic bombing forces in the United Kingdom.Argument3. The Soviet Government have shown themselves sensitive to the establish-ment of N.A.T.O. forces in Scandinavia. They addressed notes of protest to the danish and Norwegian Governments when those countries signed the north atlantic Treaty and obtained from the Norwegian Government (though not fromthe Danish Government) an undertaking that no foreign bases would be established on their territory in time of peace.4. The latest development is that, according to an agency report, the SovietGovernment has protested to the Danish Minister in Moscow in a note stating thatthe intention of allowing bases to forces of the Atlantic alliance &quot; could be inter-preted as a violation of the assurances given by the Danish Government in its note of 4th May, 1949, in which Denmark said that she had no intention of joining anyaggressive policy directed at Russia.&quot; The Danish Government was reminded ofthe promise made by its mission in Moscow in March 1946 that it would establishits own administration without foreign troops at Bornholm. The note continuedthat the intention of lending military bases on Danish territory to foreign troops&quot; must be considered as endangering the security of the Soviet Union and of othercountries in the Baltic region.&quot;  The Danish Foreign Minister is reported as having
stated that Denmark has made no decision regarding the stationing of foreign forcesin the country and that no decision would be taken until Parliament had discussed the matter.5. We do not want any action taken which would lead to a worsening of ourrelations with the Soviet Government and a fortiori which would convince themthat war was inevitable. At the same time it would be an error to do anything which would lend support to the Soviet thesis that the Baltic Sea is the exclusivepreserve of the adjacent States and give Norway and Denmark (and for that matterSweden) the impression that we were weakening in our determination to resistaggression in that area.6. The Danish Government themselves would be glad of the greater defencesecurity which the presence of American fighter aircraft would provide, but Danishpublic opinion still views the N.A.T.O. with some suspicion and is always reluctant to accept commitments which have not been accepted by Norway. DanishMinisters, who have undertaken that they will not proceed without parliamentary approval, have been working to educate their public opinion in favour of the project. They have been meeting with considerable success, but Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Copenhagen has reported that the decision that only Danish and norwegian naval forces should enter the Baltic in connexion with the recent opera-tion &quot; Mainbrace &quot; has had a depressing effect in Danish Service circles.7. Denmark incurred criticism early this year in the United States for the inadequacy of her defence preparations, and last July the United States Govern-ment made a strong protest to the Danish Government in connexion with the delivery to the Soviet Union of a large tanker which had been constructed in aDanish shipyard. The Danish Government would certainly incur further criticismin the United States if it adopted an unhelpful attitude towards the construction ofN.A.T.O. bases in Denmark, as also would Her Majesty&apos;s Government if it became known that the Danish attitude had our support.RecommendationWhile the stationing of bombers on Danish territory could be regarded as a potential threat to the Soviet Union and would require careful consideration, i recommend that, in view of the fact that it is only proposed to station fighters inthe projected bases, I should be authorised to reply to the Danish Governmentthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government are in agreement with the United States proposal.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,8th October, 1952.
