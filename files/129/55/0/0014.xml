Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No. 6 6C. (52) 31430th September, 1952CABINETTHE PALEY COMMISSIONNote by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i think my colleagues will be interested in the attached critical summary ofthe Report of the Paley Commission. The Memorandum estimates the effect ofthe developments forecast in the Report and the policy recommended therein tothe United States Government on the United Kingdom and the Sterling Common-wealth. It concludes by discussing some implications of the Report on UnitedKingdom policy.A fuller summary of the Report has been prepared for the commonwealth economic Conference a&amp;d is available.Ministry of Materials, S.W.1,30th September, 1952.THE REPORT OF THE PALEY commission. The Ministry of Materials have been examining the important Report of theCommission appointed by the President of the United States (the Paley Commission)on the long-term materials situation likely to face the United States and the restOf the free world. What follows is a summary of the Report and some reflectionson its importance to the United Kingdom.General Assumptions2. The Report starts from the general assumption that over the next25 years the total output of goods and services in the United. States and therest of the free world will approximately double. As the United States is in thethroes of another industrial revolution and has an economy with a high rate ofcapital formation, the Ministry think that the general picture of the future shape of its economy is not unreasonable, although it seems doubtful Whether th6 restof the free world together will progress economically at the same general rate as the United States over the next 25 years.Supply Prospects of ^Industrial Materials3. Having laid down its fundamental economic assumptions, the Reportproceeds to estimate the possible supply/demand situation in the long-term ofthe major industrial materials, although certain important materials for the UnitedKingdom and the Commonwealth are not specifically considered (e.g., wool, cotton,jute). Attached, as an appendix, are Table I, which shows the estimated long-termdemands for the materials of greatest interest to the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth as estimated by the Paley Commission, and Table II, which showsan estimate, necessarily tentative, made by the Ministry of Materials of what mightbe the amount and Value, at present prices, of the Sterling Area&apos;s share in meetingthe increase in American requirements.SWINTON.42973
4. From Table I emerges the importance attached to the non-ferrous metalsgroup as a whole. Indeed, the Report in its examination of the supply prospects of non-ferrous metals stresses the need for increased vigorous exploration anddevelopment of new ore reserves and the use of low-grade ores owing to the exhaustion of the easily accessible high-grade deposits.5. It should not, however, be assumed from the Paley Report that any vastexpansion in Sterling Area dollar earnings is likely, even over the long-term,through increased exports of industrial materials to the United States. Table IIsuggests that by 1975 there might be increased earnings of  150 million a year on the twelve main materials considered in the Report (which, however, do not include wool and jute, at present among the biggest dollar-earners). This is asizeable sum, but it would represent an annual growth of only some  6 million a year. Whether even these figures could be achieved would depend largely upontwo things:  (a) The long-term possibility of converting the Sterling Area as a copperproducer from the present position of production approximatelybalancing consumption to one of a substantial net exporter to theUnited States. Although Northern Rhodesia has made great stridesas a copper producer over the last twenty years, its long-term future as a copper producer is not yet certain.(b) The future output of the United States&apos; synthetic rubber industry in theevent of a substantially rising long-term demand for rubber. UnitedStates officials have commented, in the recent discussions of the RubberStudy Group concerning a possible Rubber Commodity Agreement,that any shortage of rubber developing in the late 1950&apos;s or early 1960&apos;scould technically be met by a rapid expansion of synthetic rubberproduction, especially if production is in the hands of-private enterprise.If an initial shortage of natural rubber developed, and it were so met,the prospect of additional natural rubber imports in the longer runwould be remote.6. On the other hand, the prospective increase in the demands of the UnitedStates for raw materials is not without serious dangers for the United Kingdom.If the expansion of supplies fails to keep pace, the superior purchasing power ofthe United States is likely to force up prices and suck in supplies largely at ourexpense. The damage done to us would be greatest in commodities, such assulphur, molybdenum, and perhaps timber, where we now draw supplies largely from the United States and other parts of the dollar area. But even in the caseof commodities of which the Sterling Area is a net exporter and consequently would benefit as a whole from the increased prices, there would be a deterioration in theterms of trade of the United Kingdom and a rise in our cost of living.Policy recommendations. The Report makes certain policy recommendations, particularly on foreign trade questions. Those of particular importance are briefly:  (a) inter-governmental agreements with raw material-producing countries toencourage and protect the investment needed for new raw materialsproduction against violent fluctuations in prices;(b) encouragement for United Nations technical assistance in geologicalsurveying and mineral exploration;(c) the establishment of a permanent agency to follow Defense MaterialProcurement Agency and other emergency agencies to make long-termpurchase contracts with foreign producers with price guarantees andto make loans for production;(d) agency contracts by the Government for foreign materials expansion;(e) permanent powers to reduce or abolish import duties on scarce materials and the repeal of the &quot; Buy America &quot; Act;(/) consideration of multilateral contracts on the model of the wheat agree-ment and of buffer stock arrangements for a few commodities withoutrestrictive provisions in order to reduce market instability;ig) changes in United States tax laws to encourage United States private investment in foieign countries;(h) the use. of stockpiling as a permanent instrument of national materialspolicy.
8. These policy recommendations constitute a&quot; significant materials policy.But, while there are already abundant signs in the United States Press and elsewhereof the interest which the Report has evoked, we cannot expect it to have animmediate influence on the new Administration and the new Congress: thoughthe very fact that the Report has been made and has obtained wide publicity is bound to have its impact.Technology9. The report places considerable stress on the role of technology in over-coming particular problems and in developing new materials. Indeed UnitedStates technology will obviously determine in a large measure the actual shape ofthe United States materials position by 1975. The attention of the Office of theLord President of the Council, of the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of fuel and Power might be drawn, we suggest, to Volume IV of the Report, &quot; The promise of Technology,&quot; in the belief that it will repay detailed study.Implications for United Kingdom Policy10. Given that the Report of the Paley Commission may be expected to haveformative effects on American public opinion and policy, which may show them-selves in action after the Presidential Election, how can we take advantage ofthese?(1) The interest indicated in international commodity arrangements gives anopportunity for serious consideration of agreements in cases, of whichrubber is the current example, where a suitable agreement would beto the advantage of the Commonwealth and the Sterling Area. the americans will, however, look to us to produce the ideas and to showwillingness in initiating stabilisation plans for commodities of whichthe Commonwealth is the main producer.(2) American opinion may become more favourable to the establishment ofsome permanent International Organisation whether growing from theInternational Materials Conference or otherwise to keep an eye onraw materials generally and to stimulate more speedy action to dealwith emergencies in particular commodities. . This would be to our interest, and we should press it on Americans as opportunity arises.(3) Present United States Government policies for the provision of capital for development in under-developed countries are likely to be strengthened,but also canalised more towards projects which will directly improvesupplies of particular materials. We are considering these matters in preparation for the Commonwealth Economic Conference.(4) The emphasis on domestic stock-piling by the United States could have disturbing results: we should use the other recommendationswhen necessary to impress upon the United States Government theneed for regulating stock and de-stocking operations so that they donot upset the normal market.(5) American private investment in materials production may also be stimulated by the Report. We should try to see that taxation and concessionrules in Colonial territories are not deterrent to it; and we should reducethe disincentives in our own taxation to the expansion of mining andother development by British Companies.(6) We should press on more actively with geological and other survey workin the Colonial territories. More money spent on this could bring abig return in the attraction of American capital as well as profitableinvestment for our own.

Theyassume a sufficient rise in output to meet the expanding demand of the rest of the world as well as the UnitedStates.(2) Bauxite imports are for United States and Canada together, and assume a joint 1975 output of 5,000 tonsof aluminium, requiring 20 million tons bauxite, compared with 1950 output of 1-1 million tons. Naturalrubber assumes that total 1975 United States demand of 2-5 million tons will be met by 1-0 million natural,1-5 million synthetic. Rest of free world demand would be met 1-3 million natural, 1-2 million synthetic.The Paley Report puts maximum output of natural at 2-5 million, of which 200,000 may go to non-free world.An average value of 24rf. per lb. is taken.
