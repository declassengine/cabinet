CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   6C. (52) 34117th October, 1952CABINETPERSIA: INTERNAL POLITICAL  situation note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to read the attached letter, dated 13th October,from Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tehran to the Foreign Office. It gives a picture of the internal political situation in Persia.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,17th October, 1952.This has been a week of suspense and uncertainty with all Persians anxiouslyawaiting our reply to Musaddiq&apos;s latest note. The main events have been reportedseparately; the following are, therefore, a few general observations. &apos;2. It is generally agreed among Persians that Musaddiq&apos;s position hasweakened considerably since he was granted full powers. It is now becoming clear,even to the ignorant people, that Mussadiq is incapable of constructive action. Hehas remained in office through a combination of factors, namely, fear, the lack of an effective opponent and hope of an oil settlement. These factors no longer play as great&apos;a part as they did immediately after Qavam&apos;s fall. The voice of opposition was heard during Muharram from the preacher and Deputy, Rashid, and Vahidi,a member of the Fidayan-i-Islam, and there is no longer the extreme fear of expressing an opinion unfavourable to the Government that was apparent twomonths ago.3. General Zahidi, whose supporters number such diverse elements asHa&apos;irizadeh, baqa&apos;I&apos;i and the old Right-wing Opposition, has established himself asthe only alternative Prime Minister in sight. His chances of success depend largely on the progress he makes in wooing Kashani. The latter is reported to be favour-ably disposed towards the general, whom he would like to use to further his ownends, but he is proceeding with caution. Musaddiq has to-day attempted todiscredit Zahidi by associating him with an alleged &quot; plot.&quot;4. There is now a feeling of some pessimism about an oil settlement and if it becomes quite clear in the near future that Musaddiq is unable to achieve results,either with ourselves or the Americans, his already uncertain position will be seriously shaken.5. Dr. baqa&apos;I&apos;i resigned yesterday from leadership of the Toilers&apos; Party (Hizb-i-Zahmatkishan). His resignation is said to be due to differences with KhalilMaliki, the organiser of the party since its inception, who is accused of forminggroups in opposition to Dr. baqa&apos;I&apos;i. This accusation was first made at meetingsof the Toilers&apos; Party more than two months ago when, after a tour in America,baqa&apos;I&apos;i had discovered a plot, said to have been engineered by Maliki, to undermine43054Printed for the Cabinet   October 1952      &apos; &apos;
his authority as a leader of the party. At one of these meetings Maliki was accusedby Dr. baqa&apos;I&apos;i of dividing the party on an ideological basis, also of being in close contact with the British. On both these points Maliki defended himself bydeclaring that he had always opposed any suggestion of linking with the Tudeh,arid that only in his decision to fight the Communists had he done anything whichcould be construed as helping the British. Maliki&apos;s ideology is best described asTitoist.6. Relationships within the Toilers&apos; Party were adversely affected by the open conflict between baqa&apos;I&apos;i and Maliki, as a result of which BaqaTs popularityhas declined to such an extent that he could not hope to retain the leadership whilehis opponent, a much more clever: tactician, remained predominant with over-whelming support from the rank-and-file members of the party. BaqaTs positionhaving therefore become untenable, it is fairly certain that he had no alternative but to relinquish the leadership. Nevertheless, BaqaTs supporters are now trying to bring him back.7. It is too early to forecast the political significance of Dr. BaqaTs with-drawal from the Toilers&apos; Party. . Dr. baqa&apos;I&apos;i himself has said that the members arenow free to follow their own desires. This may result in the extremists deciding to transfer their; allegiance to other crypto-Communist organisations while othersmay continue to follow baqa&apos;I&apos;i, whose future intentions cannot at present be any-thing but a matter of conjecture. In any case the split is bound to be unhelpfulto Dr. Musaddiq and the National Front, for both Maliki and baqa&apos;I&apos;i, despite their differences and conflicting personal ambitions, have both been loyal supporters ofthe present regime, although baqa&apos;I&apos;i has recently been expressing in privateconsiderable dissatisfaction with Musaddiq.8. The importance of Dr. BaqaTs resignation should not be overemphasised.baqa&apos;I&apos;i is an alcoholic and no great personality in his own right.9. The general state of the country remains confused and disordered. Therehave been minor disturbances in various parts, but the most important was therailway strike. This was a display of workers&apos; solidarity protesting against failure to pay increments, and an appeal from Kashani was treated roughly. TheGovernment claims that the situation is now under control.
