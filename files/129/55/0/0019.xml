(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)mSECRETC.(52) 319 COPY NO._102ND OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTRANSPORT BILL:   PART TWO OF THE LEVYNote by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterMy colleagues on the Transport Policy Committee invited me to circulate to the Cabinet the attached notes in which I advocate abandoningpart two of the levy.SWINTONOffice of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, W. C. 2.,2ND OCTOBER, 1952.I think part two of the levy should be dropped for the following reasons:-1.        I do not believe it will survive debate in the House of Commons.If so we should get the merit of dropping it ourselves.2.       We do not lose prestige by dropping it.   We have said that in steel and Transport we wished to use the interval to get as wide a measure ofagreement as possible.3.      Not only is the levy universally unpopular, Government supportersas well as Government critics strongly believe it is wrong.4.       The only justification is that so much traffic will pass from railwayto road, that road must compensate, i. e. subsidise railways.   But the answer tothis is to allow the Transport Commission to compete on the roads.   That weare now doing.   The Commission will have a lot of road traffic.   It will have -(a) Its pre-war number of lorries plus the estimated increase which would have taken place, if transport had not beennationalised.(b) All the feeder road services
(c) The vehciles we cannot sell.(d) The right to apply to the Licensing Authority for the right to run additional lorries and new services..   5.       We are therefore doing the right thing in giving the nationalisedtransport the power to develop wherever it can give the best service.This policy which we have introduced into the Bill is right; but itis inconsistent with the levy,6,       One main object of the Bill is to sell lorries.   It is doubtful how manywe can sell.   We shall certainly sell fewer, if they carry the levy,7, We can no longer argue that road services do not contribute to thepermanent way. They pay three or four times as much in petrol tax, as therailways pay to maintain the permanent way.8.        Whatever we say, everyone else will say (and believe) the levy is afeatherbed subsidy and a disincentive to the railways to be more efficient,and economical.   The Transport Commission themselves take this view.9.        It will be impossible in practice to assess the subsidy and levy.   You can say by how much railway traffic has diminished and road traffic increased.But who can say how much less the railways would have lost if their operationhad been more competent, if restrictive practices had been reduced, if economieshad been made, if their road services had been more progressive and efficient?10, A limit on the amount of the levy is no answer; and the figure suggestedwill merely increase opposition.lil.       The levy is certainly no deterrent to renationalisation.   The onlyanswer to that is a Bill which is popular and workable;  which people willbelieve is an unprejudiced attempt to give the best service without ideologies andwhich works well when it&apos; is in operation.
