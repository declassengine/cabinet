secret. (52) 3224TH OCTOBER, 1952COPY NO.    i-7CABINETEAST/WEST TRADEEXPORTS OF RUBBER TO RUSSIA AND HER EUROPEANSATELLITES, CHINA AND NORTH. KOREAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of trade on the 8th May, 1952, the Cabinet considered a memorandum (C. (52) 138)which reviewed at length the strategic, political and commercial considerationsgoverning the export of rubber to Russia and her allies.   The Cabinet approved the conclusions of the memorandum, including the following (C. C. (52) 51stConclusions, Minute 3):&quot;(i)  Under present conditions Her Majesty&apos;s Government should maintain their present embargo on shipments of rubber to North Korea and china.   This should be reviewed on any change in conditions(e.g. a truce or armistice in Korea or a general change of policy towards China).((ii) As regards supplies of rubber to the Soviet Bloc, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should maintain their present policy - i. e, that it isfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to decide where the balance ofadvantage lies between security and economic considerations,(iii)  From the Security point of view it is desirable that supplies of rubberfrom all sources to the Soviet Bloc should not exceed the estimates of civil consumption within the Bloc,   Broader considerations mayjustify some relaxation. &quot;The Cabinet agreed that exports to Russia from United Kingdomcontrolled sources in 1952 should be limited to 80,000 tons (in addition to acarry-over of 18,000 tons from 1951).   Exports to the European satellites arebeing licensed at the annual rate of 30,000 tons from United Kingdom controlledsources (C.C,(52) 80th Conclusions, Vlinute 7). ,2. It is necessary now to fix the level of exports from United Kingdomcontrolled sources in 1953.   The Russians have already bought about20,000 tons of rubber which will arrive from Malaya for re-export from theUnited Kingdom in the first quarter.   In order to avoid a situation in whichlicences have to be refused for rubber which the Russians have already bought,it is essential to inform them and the satellites as soon as possible of themaximum quantity which may be licensed in the first half of the year.
3. Recent developments.    There is no reason to modify the conclusionsof C. (52) 138 set out above, but certain new factors need to be taken intoaccount in fixing the level of exports in 1953:The estimates of civil consumption during 1953 in Russia and the satellites are between 65,000 and 80,000 tons and about 50,000 tons respectively, as against the figures of 85,000 tons and 35,000 tons which were submitted to the Cabinet last May as estimates for theyear 1952.   (These estimates are made on the best information available which is not as complete as could be wished).Restrictions on exports from United Kingdom controlled sourceshave been accompanied by increases in exports to Russia and the satellites from other sources;  according to the best estimates which can be made these exports have in the first eight months of1952 been at an annual rate of about 15,000 tons to Russia and at about the same rate to the satellites.Negotiations for a new coarse grains contract have resulted inagreement on the sale by Russia of only 200,000 tons so far ascompared with the 800,000 tons secured under the 1951 contract.Even for this quantity the rubber clause has had to be included inthe contract terms; under this, the Russians are free to stop orcurtail deliveries of grain if they cannot buy the rubber they want.They have made it clear that they are not prepared to discuss furthersales until they know what they can buy with the proceeds.The price of top-grade rubber is now below two shillings a pound.Attitude of United States GovernmentIn discussions which took place in London in April, 1952(summarised in paragraphs 6 and 7 of C. (52) 138) the United States Governmenturged, inter alia that our rubber exports to the Soviet Bloc should be limitedto amounts necessary to obtain our essential imports, and that the soviet bloc&apos;s receipts of rubber from all sources in 1952 should not exceed the levels of the previous year.   In a written reply of 23rd May Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment after explaining that their policy represented a balance of security and other considerations, stated that they &quot;reserve to themselvesdiscretion to license shipments in excess of the level set by strict securityconsiderations where, in their view, this offers the only practicable means ofobtaining essential imports or where broader political and economic considerations justify such action&quot;.   No rejoinder has been received from theUnited States Government.   The latter are, however, under continual pressure from Congressional and public opinion to show energy in enforcing the BattleAct.   While they are probably not sanguine about reducing United Kingdomrubber exports, any increase in existing levels might be expected to evokea sharp reaction.5. Suggested level of exports from United Kingdom controlled sources in 1953.The application of the principles accepted by the Cabinet in May gives rise to no difficulty in the case of China and North Korea (where the embargomust be maintained).In the case of Russia the strict application of the security criteriawould point to a limit of between 50,000 and 65,000 tons on supplies from(b)(c)(d)
United Kingdom controlled sources.   To the extent that the assumptionsupon which this figure is based are accurate, any additional supplies might beexpected to go to swell the Russian stockpile estimated last May at 100,000tons of rubber.   But the Russians are certainly counting on receiving atleast last year&apos;s figure of 80,000 tons.   Their attitude over the coarse grainscontract (paragraph 3(c) above) is significant and suggests that they are not likelyto sell us more coarse grain until they are assured of continuing supplies of rubber.   Our need for non-dollar coarse grains is as great as ever.   timber supplies from the Soviet Bloc this year are indeed of less importance owing tothe release of stocks;  but in 1953 total imports will increase and it will be important to be in a position to obtain larger quantities from Eastern Europeif we are to reduce the need for dollar supplies and keep down Finnish and swedish prices.   Moreover, the economic and political situation in Malayamakes any further reduction in permitted exports extremely difficult,particularly if, as experience in 1952 suggests, our restrictions merely divertSoviet Bloc purchases elsewhere.   On these grounds the strict application of thesecurity criteria appears unrealistic, and exports of at least 80,000 tons seemunavoidable if our essential objectives are to be secured.   If this figure is approved we would propose at this stage to tell the Russians that we areprepared to license 40,000 tons in the first half of 1953, of which not more than25,000 tons would be licensed in either quarter.   (The offer of the remaining40,000 tons would be reserved for further coarse grains negotiations.)Seen from Washington this figure, exceeding the strict security quotaby some 25 per cent, will appear to imply a change in policy.   The UnitedStates Government will be aware through intelligence channels of thereassessment of civilian needs noted in paragraph 3(a) above, and of theamount of Russian imports from other sources.   They also know that we have sofar contracted only for 200,000 tons of coarse grains.   However we should be onfirm ground in defending the figure of 80,000 tons or at least 40,000 tons for thefirst half-year on the basis of our memorandum of 23rd May (paragraph 4 above),and the United States Government may derive some consolation from the fact thatit does not exceed the 1952 level.In the case of the satellites the security criteria would permit a levelof 35,000 tons (as against 30,000 tons in 1952).   We depend, however, much lesson the satellites for essential supplies, and an increase in our rubber exportsto them above the current rate, taken in conjunction with a substantial over-shipment of the Russian security quota might well oblige the United states administration to align itself with public criticism of our policy, withregrettable results elsewhere.   Exports to the satellites should therefore, inour view, remain at mis year&apos;s figure of 30,000 tons, but the position should be reviewed later in the light of the circumstances then obtaining, including anyfurther evidence of the level of satellite purchases from sources not controlled by the United Kingdom.6. Re commendationsIn the light of these considerations we recommend:(i) that the present embargo on exports to China and North Koreashould continue, subject as before to review on any changein conditions.
that exports from United Kingdom controlled sources in1953 to Russia and the satellites should remain at 80,000 tons and30,000 tons respectively, subject in the case of Russia tothe tactics proposed in section 5 and in the case of the satellites to review in the light of purchases from other sources.7. We ask our colleagues to approve these recommendations and toagree that the United States Government should be informed of the proposedlevel of exports to Russia and the satellites in 1953.A.E.P.T.4TH OCTOBER, 1952.
