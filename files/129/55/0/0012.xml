CONFIDENTIALAMENDMENT OF THE TOWN AND, COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in paper C. (52) 304, the Minister of Housing has presented to theCabinet his draft of a White Paper on his policy for amending the Town and country Planning Act, 1947.   I am not concerned with the main proposalsfor the abolition of development charge.   From these I do not dissent.   Butthere is one aspect of the proposals which I, like I am sure others, findprofoundly disturbing.   In the covering memorandum, he states that theCabinet have agreed to the principle that whereas landowners who sell to private developers shall receive present use value plus present development value, i. e. the full market value, landowners whose land is acquired by apublic authority or compulsorily sterilised shall only receive present use value plus the 1947 development value.   I have personally never accepted this principle, and I feel bound once more to trouble my colleagues with the reasons.The differentiation which the Minister seeks to make between the two categories of landowners seems to me to be entirely inequitable;   I do not believe that itcould lead to a permanent settlement of this very thorny question;  and Igravely fear that, though it may have the effect of modifying Socialist opposition and I even doubt this - it will be extremely unpopular with wide sections ofthe Conservative Party.   For it is a great mistake to suppose that the owner-ship of land in this country is confined, nowadays, to a small body of richterritorial magnates, who are politically unimportant.   It is very widelyspread, and a vast quantity of the property which is likely to be compulsorily acquired or sterilised is today owned by small men.   These small ownersare the backbone of our party, and they may well be severely hit by thisprovision and bitterly resentful of the inequity involved.2. On what basis is this differentiation made?   Why should we propose(as is suggested in paragraph 25 of the White Paper) that &quot;the Governmentshould pay compensation for loss of development value created in the past -up to the time the 1947 axe fell - but not for the loss of development valuecreated in the future?&quot;  The Minister states very fairly the arguments against his own proposal in paragraph 27.   He admits that there is hardship.   But,he adds, such hardship is already inherent in the Act of 1947.   He seems toassume that this is an entire justification of his scheme.   But I cannot accept this assumption.   After all, the 1947 Act was introduced, not by a ,Conservative Government, but by a Socialist Government, and it is admittedlyfull of injustices.   Indeed, one of the main purposes of the proposed Bill is toremove these.   Why then perpetuate one of the most glaring?   Why shouldMr. A. , who may be very poor, receive only the 1947 development value for his land, which is acquired by a public body or sterilised, whereas Mr. B,who may be very rich, is to get the whole present day market value, merely because he is fortunate enough to be allowed to sell his land to a privatedeveloper.   There seems no rhyme or reason in it.   The Minister defends theC.(52) 312COPY NO.30TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINET
proposal by broad references to what he describes as &quot;the general principleof good neighb our line ss and public interest&quot;, and, in paragraph 32, by the(more specific argument that &quot;if public authorities were required to pay fullmarket value for land needed for public purposes they would, in many cases,have to pay a price enhanced by public improvements made at public expense&quot;.But that is equally true of nearly all private development.   It has indeed often been argued in the past that all value is created by the community, and that only the community should benefit by its development.   But that is a contention that has never been accepted by the Conservative Party.   In this particular case, the Minister does accept it in a   modified form, and his conclusion isthat a certain measure of confiscation is therefore justifiable.   That seemsto me an extremely dangerous principle for the Conservative Party to adopt.Moreover, his argument is, to my mind, seriously weakened by hiscomplementary proposal, in paragraph 34, that public authorities should be bothempowered and encouraged to buy compulsorily land which is earmarked in their plans for early development, not only for public purposes but &quot;in order tomake it available to private developers on easy terms&quot;.   They are to be ableto buy in the lowest market and sell at whatever price they like.   The assumptionrunning through the whole paper is that public authorities are always generousand humane and private owners are extortionate ruffians.   That is strangedoctrine for the Conservative Party, and I do not believe that there is any basis for it in fact.   Indeed, I have seen examples within recent times which lead toexactly the opposite conclusion.   Nor do I accept his argument that though,in his proposal, there may indeed not be equality as between landowner andlandowner, &quot;it is an illusion to suppose that equality is synonymous with equity&quot;.In this particular instance, I should have thought that the two were entirelysynonymous,3. It may seem from my argument that I am in favour of limiting thedevelopment rights of all landowners, whether they sell to private or publicdevelopers - or are precluded from developing at all - to the 1947 value;  and indeed I do feel that that would be far more equitable than the Ministers present plan.   But the real difficulty in pursuing that course is that, as he himselffrankly recognises, it is likely to be impossible, with the passage of time, tomaintain that position.   People who want land badly enough will pay more than the1947 value for it, and no one will be able to stop them.   That is already happeningtoday on a large scale.   What I should like therefore to suggest is that thestandard value for all land that is bought and sold after the passing of the newAct shall be the present market value, whether it is acquired by a public or private buyer.   In the vast majority of car? ?s,   this will easily be agreed, asI know from personal experience:  for the ordinary private owner, I wouldrepeat  is not extortionate.   Provision must however of course be made for thecases where the owner stands out for an unduly high price from a public body.In such cases, I suggest that the matter should be referred to an independent body of experts for arbitration, the decision of that body being final.   Thisshould be an entirely effective deterrent against the extortion of an excessiveprice by an antiasocial owner:  and, in practice, I believe that the cases referredto the arbitral body would be few, since the actual presentation of the seller&apos;scase before it would be expensive and he would only refer to it on occasions when he felt that he was being really hardly treated.4, I submit this alternative proposal with all deference to my colleagues.It is, I know, always an invidious and ungrateful task in these days to put thecase for landowners.   They are not, politically, a popular body.   But they areas entitled to justice as other sections of th^ community, and they are nowadays,I would repeat, not a very restricted and immensely rich class:  they includeinnumerable small owners, many of whom have invested the savings of a lifetimein land or houses.   If they are not to get protection from the Conservative Party,
Lf6to whom are they to look for it?   Under the Minister of Housing&apos;s proposals,many of them will be even worse treated by us than by the Socialist Government.lfThen,they would at any rate have got, immediately, their share of the  300 millionsNow, they will not even get that.   Nor will they get (see paragraph 30) compensationfor refusal to permit change of user, though the present user may give theowner no adequate return on his investment, and the prospect of a redevelopmentof his property involving change of user may have been the sole reason why.he originally bought it.   They will have to wait until their land is acquiredor sterilised, and even then - it may be years hence, when conditions, may haveentirely changed - many of them will only get the 1947 development value.5. I cannot believe that by a sacrifice of our principles to politicalexpediency such as seems to be envisaged in these proposals, we shall enhanceour credit or authority either with our own supporters or with the country asa whole.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.30th SEPTEMBER, 1952.
