TRANSPORT BILL: THE TRANSPORT LEVYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and PowerOne of the principal features of the Transport Bill which the Cabinet approvedon 3rd July (C. (52) 65th Conclusions, Minute 4) is the transport levy on all butsmall road haulage vehicles. This can be regarded as falling into two parts,according to the purposes for which the money is to be applied:  Part one. To compensate the British Transport Commission for any lossarising out of the disposal of the Road Haulage Executive^ undertaking.Part two. To make good to the Commission future losses of net revenuedue to future transfers of traffic from rail to road so far as it is not practicable to offset them by compensating economies.2. Part one of the levy is generally accepted as necessary and just. Butpart two, ever since the publication of the White Paper on Transport Policy(Cmd. 8538) in May last, has met with widespread hostility. At recent meetingsof the Transport Policy Committee we have considered whether some change should be made and, since we are almost equally divided, we find it necessary tosubmit the question for decision to the Cabinet. It is urgent because we must havea clear line of policy before transport is considered by the Party Conference on 9th October.Arguments against Part Two of the Levy3. These are both political and economic. The political argument is brieflythat hostility to part two of the levy is so strong even on our own side that it willnot survive debate in Parliament. If that is accepted, there would be merit in takingthe initiative of dropping part two of the levy and the Government need notnecessarily lose prestige by doing so, having announced before the Recess thatthey wished to use the interval to get as wide a measure of agreement as possible.A further political argument is that the levy might be used by a subsequent labour government as a precedent for levies to equalise the competitive position of otherindustries e.g., cotton and rayon, in quite different circumstances.4. The economic argument against part two of the levy is that it is wrong to &quot; featherbed &quot; the railways by increasing the burden on road haulage, whichis already very heavily taxed as it is. (It must be pointed out, however, that railwaylosses in the long run are featherbedded by the Exchequer.)5. Part two of the levy also involves practical and administrative dis-advantages. Many senior railway officials have expressed their dislike of it to theMinister of Transport. It is said that it will poison relations between road and rail, that it will provide continuing irritation to road hauliers and to trade andindustry and that it will be difficult to assess, ^becoming progressively more so withthe passage of time. Further it is said that, if the railways can rely on an automaticsubsidy from the levy, there is little incentive to them to make either their railwayor road services economical and efficient. The levy is naturally opposed by industry,Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952SECRETCopy No, 7 3C. (52) 3182nd October, 1952CABINET42995
which wants to use the cheapest form of transport without having to pay for theupkeep of the railways which they nevertheless expect always to be available whenneeded. The road haulier objects to a charge which may reduce his competitiveadvantage.6. The Transport Policy Committee have considered whether opposition to part two of the levy could be mitigated by imposing a ceiling to prevent excessivegrowth; but the Committee have decided not to recommend such a course.Arguments in Favour of Part Two of the Levy7. Part two of the levy was originally accepted in principle, and is stillregarded by those of us who believe in it, as the essential feature of the Bill. TheTransport Act, 1947, was an attempt to make the whole of transport self-supportingby means of financial and organisational integration. The Act has failed to produce the right results and the levy is a free-enterprise solution to the same problem.It leaves transport users free to choose the form of transport they prefer but itensures that, if transport users prefer the cheapness and convenience of private-enterprise road haulage, they shall still pay their share of maintaining the railwayswhich the country as a whole must still keep going and whose services all transportusers need from time to time. On this view, part two of the levy is a semi-automaticbalancing factor which will ensure that transport as a whole pays for itself or rather is paid for by the users of transport while individual transport users aregiven freedom of choice. Its supporters think that the railways cannot success-fully compete with road experience in all countries points to this conclusion andthat the attempt to do so will involve among other undesirable factors highercharges for traffic tied to rail (such as coal). We cannot be satisfied with arrange-ments which, while failing to enable the railways to make both ends meet, make no other provision for covering their losses and thus leave a potentially unlimitedburden to be borne by the Exchequer.8. The political, argument against dropping part two of the levy is that, ifwe do so, the Opposition will be able to hold the Bill up to obloquy as going furthertowards &quot; selling out &quot; the railways and the railwaymen to the road haulage interests.Possible Alternatives to the Levy9. Those of us who wish to give up part two of the levy realise that we cannot do so without putting something, else in its place. Otherwise the railways willsimply be exposed to the full blast of competition from almost unrestricted private-enterprise road haulage. The Bill already goes some way to put the railways ina more favourable position. Some greater freedom in the matter of charges isconferred by the Bill. In addition the railways or rather the British transport commission are to be allowed to keep all the railways&apos; feeder road services andalso the railways&apos; pre-war interests in road haulage, plus the increase in those interests which it is estimated would have taken place if transport had not beennationalised. It will be open to the Commission, as to any other transport opeiator,to apply to the licensing authorities for the right to run additional lorries and newservices. Finally, it seems possible that private purchasers will not be found forthe whole of the Road Haulage Executive assets, any part of which remainingunsold must continue to be operated by the Commission. The proposals for allowing the railways to retain limited road haulage interests were intended toreduce the amount falling to be met by the levy but, if this part of the levy goesaltogether, other measures are necessary to provide any prospect that the railways,even with their ancillary road services and their interests in road transport, shallbe self-supporting.  These are as follows :  (a) Even greater freedom in the matter of charges. The railways are ham-hampered by numerous restrictions on special and competitive quoting, most of which date from the time when the railways had a monopoly of transport and had to berestrained from exploiting it. Negotiations are going on between the Commissionand a committee representative of trade and industry. If this committee were torealise that placing the railways in a position to charge competitively would makepart two of the levy unnecessary, they might well reach an agreement with theCommission. It should, however, be clear to them that the greater freedom con-templated for the Commission must be expected to result in higher charges fornbri-competitive traffics such as coal, iron and steel, other minerals, &amp;c.
(b) Decentralisation. The Bill provides that the Commission are to submit toI the Minister of Transport a scheme for decentralising the railways.    Thedecentralisation will need to be drastic and to apply to the railways&apos; road interests as well. The effect should be much greater flexibility of administration andconsequently much greater competitive power.(c) Capital.-The Commission have to provide  35 million a year towards theservice of British Transport stock. Of this sum the Commission regard some 28 million as the proper contribution of the railways. Unlike the pre-nationalisa-tion holders of railway shares, the holders of British Transport stock have their interest guaranteed. It would greatly increase the freedom of the railways to deviserates fully competitive with road transport if, while still being expected to make asubstantial contribution, they could be relieved of a substantial part of the liability to meet fixed interest charges. It must be realised that the only possible sourcefrom which to meet the balance is the Exchequer, and that, once this possibilityhad been accepted, there would be no point at which pressure for higher railway wages, better services and lower charges could be resisted short of the completetransfer of these fixed interest charges to the Exchequer. On the other hand, someof us argue that, with decentralisation and greater freedom of charging, the balanceof fixed interest charges falling on the Exchequer would not be unduly large andmight in the long run disappear.10. It is the belief of those who favour that course that, if part two of the levy were dropped and if the measures set out in the preceding paragraph were adopted, the present hostility towards the Bill of trade and industry and independentopinion would disappear, and that a lasting solution of the country&apos;s transportproblem would have been found. Some of us. however, anticipate serious opposition from trade and industry if increased freedom in charging is accorded to the railways,though some of us believe in the possibilities of a large measure of agreementbetween the Commission and trade and industry, especially if, as a concession tothe latter, part two of the levy is dropped.Conclusion11. All members of the Committee see great force in the political arguments against part two of the levy; and most might be prepared to abandon it if someother means of attaining the same end could be found. But those of us who favourpart two of the levy do so because it attempts to provide a constructive solution ofthe road-rail problem, based on consumers&apos; choice but ensuring that transport as awhole pays for itself and does not become a burden on the Exchequer. They cannotbelieve that the alternatives suggested are sufficient to enable the railways to pay. their way or that the relaxations proposed in control over railway charges willescape serious opposition by trade and industry. Their view is that there must bea limit, for instance, to the extent to which the railways could discriminate betweencustomers. There must also be a limit to the extent to which failure by the railwaysto make ends meet throws additional burdens on the Exchequer. Being, as I have said, almost equally divided, the Committee must refer the matter to the Cabinet.I ask.my colleagues to decide whether:  (a) The Bill to be introduced into Parliament at the beginning of the next session, and to be defended at the Party Conference on 9th Octobernext, should be substantially in the form now before the House,including part two of the transport levy; or(b) The Bill should be amended by dropping part two of the levy and by adding provisions, in respect of the railways&apos; powers in the matter of charges, designed to enable nationalised transport, after the disposal ofthe Road Haulage Executive, to make ends meet without assistance fromother forms of transport.   .L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,2nd October, 1952.
