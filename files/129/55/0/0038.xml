I2tf; OCONFIDENTIALC(52) 338 COPY NO.^15TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTURKISH AR.MAMENTS CREDITSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum sets out the history ofthe dispute between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Turkish government over the repayment of the 1938 and 1939 Armaments Credits.   These creditswere granted to the Turkish Government under an Agreement dated27th May, 1938, and under the Treaty of Mutual Assistance of the19th October, 1939, the proceeds being destined for the purchase of warmaterial necessary for the defence of Turkey.2. In October, 1950, the Turkish Government, without warning,addressed a note to Her Majesty&apos;s Government asking for completecancellation of the credits.   They were informed that this request could not begranted but that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to consider any&quot;serious proposals&quot; for lightening the burden.   The Turkish reply was arestatement of the demand for cancellation, and default.   Since that time theyhave treated all efforts to reach a reasonable settlement with disdain.3. At the time of the default the amount owing to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment v/as  32.5 millions, exclusive of military supplies, etc.,aggregating about  6.2 millions (which claim the Turks have consistentlyrefused to recognise) and the best offer which they have made has been 2^ millions which has been rejected as completely unacceptable^   TheForeign Secretary now asks for authority to accept  5 millions with discretion to close for  3 millions if needs be.4. While I would be prepared, if the Turks showed real signs ofbeing willing to arrive at a fair settlement, to accept rather less than 16 millions, it seems to me that a settlement at a figure of between  3millions and  5 millions (and that over a period of years) would be worse thanno settlement at all, and would set a very undesirable precedent.5. I recognise the political importance of reaching a settlement andI share the Foreign Secretary&apos;s desire to avoid a deterioration in Anglo-Turkish relations, but the Turks can be under no illusions as to the sort of settlement Her Majesty&apos;s Government have all along had in mind and, in my view, they can have no legitimate cause for grievance if Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment refuse to entertain what is little better than a token offer.6. I recognise, too, that these credits were granted for the purposeof common defence and that Turkey shouldered a heavy burden during the war;but their country was spared the ravages of physical destruction and theirsacrifices cannot possibly be compared with our own.   Their burdens inrelation to the strength of their economy are nothing compared to ours.
7. I am advised that a settlement would not require legislation butthe proprieties undoubtedly require that a report should be made to theHouse.   I think it would be very difficult to defend a settlement on the lines proposed in view of the position in which we find ourselves.   I do not see how the Commonwealth would understand how we are able to forego ourjust claims.8. Unless, therefore, the Turks are prepared to make aconsiderable advance on their offer, or we are to be relieved of our everincreasing commitments, I would prefer to leave the matter in suspensefor the time being.R.A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,15TH OCTOBER, 1952.
