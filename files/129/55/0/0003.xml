SECRET Copy No.    ?C. (52) 30320th September, 1952CABINETTHE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ORDER, 1951: POSITION of professional ORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service find it necessary to refer to my colleagues, and to ask them to resolve, a difference between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself about an amend-ment which I desire to make to the Industrial Disputes Order, 195.1 (Order 1376)relating to the position of Professional Organisations.2. This Order, as my colleagues are aware, provides for industrial disputes which are reported to me to be referred in certain circumstances to compulsory arbitration. The provision was first introduced as a wartime measure in 1940 andembodied in the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940(Order 1305). At the end of the war it was continued at the request of both sides of industry. In conditions of peace certain of the provisions of the original Orderwere found to be inappropriate and last year, after long discussions with industry,the old Order was revoked and replaced by the present Industrial Disputes Order.3. Unfortunately in drafting the new Order the expression &quot; trade union &quot; was used to describe the organisations which had the right of reporting disputes onbehalf of workers.4. This had the result of excluding from the right to report disputes manyprofessional organisations which, while not technically trade unions, habituallytake part in negotiating conditions of employment on- behalf of their members.(Such organisations include, for example, the Royal College of Nursing and other organisations of professional employees in the health field, the British medical association, the National Union of Teachers, &amp;c). Immediately, a large numberof professional organisations protested to my predecessor and subsequently to myselfat the withdrawal from them of a right which they had enjoyed under the old Order.5. This result was never intended. There is no reason on merits why profes-sional organisations should be excluded from the right to report disputes under theOrder. There is no reason why they should be treated any differently from tradeunions in this matter. Their exclusion has led to the anomaly in some cases wheretrade unions and professional organisations form part of the same machinery of negotiation for the same category of employees, that the trade union representing a small minority of the employees can report a trade dispute whereas the professionalorganisation representing the great majority of the employees cannot.6. I came to the conclusion that this could not be justified and that the rightto report disputes which the professional organisations had enjoyed under the oldOrder and which had been taken away from them by inadvertence must be restored to them. Accordingly, several months ago, after discussion with the National joint advisory Council, I informed the professional organisations mainly concerned thatI would make the necessary amendment to the Order.7. Before I did so, however, my Department consulted the Treasury whichexpressed serious concern at the prospect of highly paid professional persons being42926Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1952
able to take to compulsory arbitration claims for improved remuneration. Thisconcern arises largely, I understand, out of the experience of the Danckwerts Awardfor general practitioners. The Treasury are anxious to prevent the reactions ofthat Award spreading to other sections of the Public Service and in particular toavoid giving consultants in the Health Service the right to compulsory arbitration;they feel that any extension of the use of compulsory arbitration by highly paidprofessional or managerial staff is dangerous and might have serious consequencesin the Civil Service itself and that large increases of salary to such staff would do much harm to the policy of wage restraint. In addition they regard the industrial disputes Tribunal as unsuitable for pronouncing upon the claims of such people and feel that the Government could retain more flexibility by the use of ad hocmachinery specially constituted. After much discussion the Treasury have suggestedthat the best way of meeting these difficulties is to introduce a salary limit into theOrder in other words to give access to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal only to persons whose salaries are not above a certain figure.8. I cannot accept this suggestion. I have much sympathy with the appre-apprehensions expressed by the Treasury, but I cannot help feeling that they areexaggerated.9. During the period from 1940 to 1951 during which the old Order was inforce and the right to report disputes was far more extensive than is now proposed,none of the dangers feared by the Treasury materialised. I see no reason why theyshould in future.10. As regards the medical profession, the view is held by the legal advisers to my Ministry and the Ministry of Health that a dispute as to the amount of remuneration made available for medical practitioners providing general medical services under the National Health Service cannot be dealt with under the Ordereven if the proposed amendment is made. It seems very unlikely that consultantswould wish to make use of the present Industrial Disputes Tribunal since they want a different kind of Tribunal including representatives of the medical pro-fession. There is naturally room for difference of opinion as to the suitability ofthe Industrial Disputes Tribunal for pronouncing upon the claims of highly paidprofessional or managerial staff. But at least the Tribunal has long and variedexperience of dealing with wage claims which raise extremely complicated issues,and not merely with straightforward claims.11. The Treasury proposal raises issues that are different from and muchmore fundamental than those involved in my limited proposal to restore to profes-sional organisations the right which they, previously enjoyed and which, as I have explained, was taken away from them only by inadvertance.12. The proposal for a salary limit would take away the right of. access to compulsory arbitration from persons who now enjoy that right under the presentOrder, for a considerable number of associations (including some professionalorganisations), which are in a position to satisfy the definition of a trade union inthe Order, have in membership professional and other persons with high salaries.13. The Treasury proposal indeed involves a fundamental change in thescheme of compulsory arbitration as embodied first in Order 1305 and now in Order1376. Such a change would involve long and difficult negotiations with all parties in industry (not merely the professional organisations). It would be very difficult for me to await the uncertain outcome of those negotiations before fulfilling myundertaking to the professional organisations to restore to them the right to reportdisputes under the Order.14. Accordingly I propose to my colleagues that I should now proceed with-out further delay to amend Order 1376 so as to restore to professional organisations the right to report disputes under the Order.-      W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,20th September, 1952.
