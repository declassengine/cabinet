Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1952I CABINET office i meows SECTIONCONFIDENTIALCopy &quot;No.C. (52) 30425th September, 1952CABINETAMENDMENT OF THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI was authorised to prepare a draft of the kind of &quot; White Paper &quot; which mightbe used in connection with the proposed amendment of the Town and country planning Act, 1947.2.   Here it is.3. It has been prepared by me, with the help of my advisers in the Ministryof Housing only.If the principles are approved, a revised text will be necessary, in consultation,with other Departments concerned.4. The object of the draft is to show how the Limited Compensation scheme might be presented to Parliament and the public.5.   General agreement has now been reached on all but one point.6.   It is agreed that the  300 million shall not be distributed next year.It is agreed that compensation for land compulsorily acquired or compulsorilysterilised, shall be at existing use value plus 1947 claim, and shall only be paid as and when each case arises.It is agreed that development charge, at .100 per cent, should be modified.7. The only difference is this: I want to abolish development charge. TheChancellor of the Exchequer wants to reduce it to (say) 60 per cent.8.   The arguments for abolition are,id) that it is a hateful and hated tax;(b) that it cannot be (like ordinary taxes) accurately calculated, but depends onthe judgment of the valuer, and is often a matter for &quot; negotiation &quot;;(c) that it is a tax on development.   The old land reformers used to attackundeveloped land, not development;(d) that the developer has to pay out hard cash at the very moment when heis incurring all the costs of development;(e) that there seems no logical basis for 60 per cent, more than for 50 per cent.,40 per cent, or any other percentage.9.   The arguments for retaining charge are,(a) that it is unfair that some landowners (where land is not compulsorily acquired or compulsorily sterilised) should get the full profits arisingfrom sale for development, while others will only get limitedcompensation;(b) that it is wrong that private owners should pocket &quot; betterment&quot; due to public effort;(c) to allow (a) and (b) would offend the public conscience and may become ascandal; lead to much political agitation; and perhaps end in a clamourfor land nationalisation.42941a
10.   My reply to this is,(a) that the wide use of compulsory purchase for re-sale to private owners aspart of local authority development schemes will avoid any scandal;(b) that if you want to keep a tax on permitted development and any profits made, then you should tax the man who sells land (who is receiving cash)not the man who develops land (who is paying out cash). This, of course,is a matter for a Finance Bill, not for an amendment of the Town and country Planning Bill;(c) that large scale development for private housing will need to be stimulatedrather than restrained;(d) that if the Government want to acquire all development rights, then theymust pay for them, (i.e., stick to the present scheme the  300 millionpayout);11.   I would present the political case as follows,(a) Socialists were prepared to pay out  300 million to landowners, howeverremote the intention to develop. We think this a scandalous waste ofpublic money.  Indeed, we propose &quot; compensation as you go &quot;;(b) development charge is a clog on development and falls specially hard onlittle men, we abolish it;(c) charge for &quot; change of use &quot; seems indefensible to most people. If &quot; changeof use &quot; is undesirable, &quot; planning &quot; stops it. Why should you pay for doing what &quot; planning&quot; says it is in the public interest that you should do.12. These are the arguments. I hope the Cabinet will have an early discussion and decision. We must make a decision quickly, for Parliamentary and technical reasons.H.

ANNEXPROVISIONAL   DRAFT   OF   WHITE   PAPERTOWN AND country planning  ACT,   1947AMENDMENT OFFINANCIAL PROVISIONS
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 19470AMENDMENT OF FINANCIAL PROVISIONSProvisional Draft of White PaperPart I. introduction. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had under review the financial provisionsof the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947.2. When these provisions were introduced into Parliament they commandeda broad measure of agreement. Indeed, they do not differ very greatly from theproposals contained in the White Paper on the Control of Land Use (Cmd. 6537)which was laid before Parliament in 1944 by the Coalition Government. But inoperation they have attracted a great deal of criticism from many different quarters;from local authorities, from representatives of industry and commerce, from pro-fessional bodies, from property owners, large and small, and from many privatepeople anxious to build themselves a house or to engage in some other enterprise.Her Majesty&apos;s Government think it will be generally agreed that the financial pro-visions are giving rise to difficulties in practice.3. The problem which the financial provisions were designed to meet is the dual one of compensation and betterment arising out of the control of land use.This control inevitably inflicts loss on some people, while conferring benefits onothers. The resulting problem of compensation and betterment was analysed inthe Report of the Uthwatt Committee published in 1942 (Cmd. 6386), summarised in the White Paper of 1944 and fully discussed in the debates on the Bill for theAct of 1947.4. The solution adopted in the 1947 Act was to vest all development rights inthe State, and to make intending developers pay to the State a licence fee (develop-ment charge) on being granted permission to carry out development. Three mainpillars support the system: : &apos; j ,(i) no development^ may be carried out without planning permission and,subject to certain exceptions, when, permission is granted a develop-ment charge must be paid based on the increase in the value of the landdue to the grant of permission;(ii) payment is to be made out of a  300 million fund to anyone who can showthat his interest in land is materially depreciated by the Act. Claims forthis purpose have been made and nearly all have been agreed or settled.(iii) as the corollary to (i) and (ii), the price at which land is bought by com-pulsory purchase is its value for its existing use (i.e., development value is excluded): and all land should in theory change hands at or about this price, though the Act does not make that obligatory.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend to maintain unimpaired the full controlof land use provided for in the Act. It is as necessary now as ever it was to preventbuilding over good agricultural land or over land containing valuable mineraldeposits; to restrain the outward sprawl of the great towns; to improve living conditions and industrial efficiency; to preserve the countryside and coast line from further disfigurement and destruction; and to enable public authorities to acquire and needed for public purposes without having to pay inflated prices.6. The question the Government have had to consider is whether it is possible,while maintaining these powers unimpaired, so to adjust the financial provisionsas to reduce or get rid of the difficulties which have arisen in practice; and to do this without materially increasing the burden on public funds or bearing too hardlyon private individuals.7. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that amendmentwhich will retain the essential features of the Act of 1947, but which will get rid of its worst practical difficulties, is possible.  Their proposals, in broad outline,* Development is very widely defined. it includes any building, engineering or miningoperationjs and any material change in the use of any buildings or of land. r;,i j ^
are set out in Part III below. In order that these may be better understood, thedifficulties in the existing system are described in Part II. The legislative programme is outlined and certain transitional questions are discussed in Part IV.Part II. The Practical Difficulties of the Existing Financial Provisions8. Most of the difficulties spring in one way or another from the unwillingnessof people to act in accordance with the theory which underlies the financial pro-visions, or from their inability to understand them, or from a widespread conviction that they are unfair. Perhaps the greatest difficulty has been that people generally donot understand either the principles or the practice of the Act, particularly the separation of development value from the land. But it is to be noted that many ofthose who do understand the Act believe that it needs amendment.9. The difficulties may best be described by reference to the main features ofthe 1947 scheme:  (i) The  300 million Fund10. At one time it was suggested that the  300 million might be grosslyinsufficient to meet claims for compensation for depreciation in values. Most ofthe claims made by owners to the Central Land Board have, however, now been assessed; and the total will be only about  350 million. Some owners whose land was ripe for development in 1947 have been promised payment in full; their claimsamount to about  100 million. Once these &quot; preference &quot; claims have been net the  fund would enable the remainder to be paid at the rate of about 16s. in the  .11. Under the Act as it stands agreed claims on the fund have to be paidbefore 1st July, 1953. But to pay all these claims in the next twelve months, apartfrom its considerable inflationary effect, would put a great deal of money into thehands of owners who have no real case for payment: who have no intention of developing their land, or whose land is not, indeed may never be, ready for develop-ment, or who can fairly be prevented without any payment from carrying outfurther development where such development would be contrary to the publicinterest (e.g., changing the use of a building to the detriment of neighbouringproperties). Furthermore, once the  300 million are paid out it would be exceedingly difficult for any future Government ever to alter the financial provisions at allradically, however badly they seemed to be working. For all the holders of claims would have been paid, both those who will be allowed to develop and those who willnot.(ii) Purchase at existing use value12. As indicated, all land transactions should, on the theory of the Act, takeplace at or around existing use value; and compulsory acquisitions do take placeon that basis. But except where they are forced to do so, owners are, naturally,unwilling to sell land for development at no more than it is worth for its existing use, since a sale on that basis provides no return for the trouble and expenseinvolved. If that is all they are to get they might as well keep the land and oneresult of the Act has been that little land is being offered for development.13. If, however, the developer pays more than existing use value, the effect ofthe Act is to increase the total which he pays for the land (since development chargehas also to be paid and it is in effect part of the purchase price). The Act is there-fore increasing the cost of private development. The Central Land Board haveindeed power to intervene in order to compel transferences on the existing usebasis; and on occasion they have, when approached by a prospective developer,acquired compulsorily on his behalf land for which the owner was asking morejthanexisting use value. But intervention of this kind in the individual case is at besthaphazard, and the implied notion that if A has a fancy to build on a bit of B&apos;s land.he can ask the State to get it for him, is not an attractive one. In any event theexistence of the power contributes to the reluctance of owners to offer land for development at all.14. To the extent, therefore, that the existing use basis is effective it hashelped to keep land off the market; and to the extent that it has been ignored thecost of development has risen. Local authorities do, of course, buy land at existing use value, and in recent years they have been responsible for a large proportion of
the building which has been done. But private developers, whose activities shouldbe encouraged, have been severely hampered through being unable to obtain landfor development at a price which takes sufficient account of their liability to charge.(iii) Development charge15. The strongest criticisms of the Act have been levelled at development charge which, if logical and perhaps equitable in theory, has seemed arbitrary andunfair in practice. The theory is that the levy of development charge by the Stateenables the public (albeit on a basis of rather rough justice) to collect any better-ment due to public effort; that it ensures equality of treatment between those whoare not allowed to develop their land and those who are; and that while it helps tomeet the cost of paying compensation it does not, or should not, add to the cost ofdevelopment. In practice, however, charge is seen as a straight tax on develop-ment which is bitterly resented; and few people can understand its basis, since itbears no obvious relation either to the cost of the land or to the cost of thedevelopment.16. The great majority of private people who want to build a house or to start a shop or other enterprise are people of small resources to whom the theoryof the financial provisions is really meaningless., Sometimes they have no claim,either because they have bought the land without getting the claim, or because theland had in 1947 little or no development value; the charge to them is just anadditional burden imposed on their enterprise. Even if they managed to buy theland cheaply they resent charge; indeed some of the bitterest complaints have comefrom those who did buy cheaply the very people in whose case the Act is workingas it was presumably meant to work. It may be that they would have had to pay more for their land had it not been for the Act; but that they could have under-stood. They could have bargained; they could have tried elsewhere; they could have been lucky. But charge is everywhere; implacable, inescapable, govern-meiital.17. For developers who hold claims on the  300 million charge is, for thetime being, not so bad. Since it was announced that the sum would be sufficient tomeetclaims at least up to 16s. in the   the Central Land Board have been setting-off charge up to 80 per cent, of the relevant claim. In other words where claim andcharge equal each other the prospective developer who holds a claim is at present,having to pay down only 20 per cent, of the charge. But very often the charge,exceeds the claim. This is bound to happen as the prospects of development con-concentrate and mature in particular places. So that most people will find, as time goes on, that the charge exceeds, in some cases greatly exceeds, the claim. It is improbable that people will willingly accept this. Also there will be many caseswhere charge must be paid where no claim was made or admitted; where in 1947there seemed to be little or no prospect of development, e.g., where the ownermerely wants to enlarge, or improve or change the use of his building. This toopeople will find it difficult to swallow. In short, it will become increasingly difficultto maintain the exaction of charge.18. Nor is the general hostility to charge by any means the only difficulty. as explained above, land-owners do not in fact sell land for development at its existing use value. There is no obligation on them to do so. The burden of chargeaccordingly falls in whole or in part upon development. Moreover it has to be paidjust at the stage when the developer is least able to meet it, when he is facing thecost of development. The true additional burden may not be very great. But withthe cost of developing as high as it is to-day any addition is serious. And sometimesthe addition is severe.19. One criticism widely made is that the basis of charge is uncertain. since it is assessed on the difference between the value of the land without permission todevelop and its value for the development permitted, it is inevitably a matter of judgment and valuation and therefore for negotiation, just as the price of land isa matter for negotiation. Quite small adjustments made in the two values duringthe process of such negotiation can sometimes have a very large effect on theamount of charge finally assessed. This is inherent in the nature of charge; but theeffect is to destroy confidence in its validity. A tax (and nothing will persuadepeople that charge is not a tax) should not be negotiated between the official and thesubject. It should be certain and as far as possible unchallengeable. This develop-ment charge of its nature cannot be.
20. Suggestions have been made in the past few years that in order to reducesome of the difficulties associated with charge, particular classes of development,such as private housing, or changes in the use of buildings, or the extension of buildings beyond the present charge-free limits, should be exempted from charge.The Government have examined the various possibilities, but have come to theconclusion that no substantial exemptions could be made without giving rise to difficulties as great as those from which it is desired to escape. The charge on private housing could not be abolished without upsetting the basis for assessment of charge on municipal housing and indeed on many other forms of development-and reducing the income from charge to a negligible amount. About 70 per cent, ofthe charge at present being collected comes from house-building (including municipalhousing). The charge on change of use or on extensions could not be abolishedwithout penalising new building by comparison with old. In any event the pro-posal that certain forms of development should be exempted from charge reallyderives from the belief that charge is a tax on development.. But it is not in theorysupposed to be anything of the kind; it is supposed to be the purchase price of thedevelopment value, which the owner would get if the State did not.21. Another possible approach would be to reduce the rate of charge for alldevelopment say to 75 per cent, or even 50 per cent. This has considerableattraction, particularly if payment of claims on the  300 million fund is deferred,and such charge as has to be paid can be set off against the claim where one applies.(Indeed, it would be difficult materially to reduce charge unless the payment of claims were deferred see paragraph 11.) This might provide the owner particu-larly the owner with a claim with an incentive to sell land at a price which wouldbe low enough for the developer to be able to pay the reduced charge without anyburden on the development.22. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have examined at length the possibility of asolution along these lines. It seems to them, however, that there can be no certainty that land would, even with a heavy reduction of charge, normally change hands ata price that took account of the developers liability to pay whatever charge islevied. The vendors of land, like the vendors of any other commodity, will get thebest price that they can and the charge, however small, would in effect be passed on,in whole or in part, to the developer. Moreover, the problem is not merely one ofeasing the market in land: there is an urgent need for developers who already ownsuitable land to be put in a position to make use of it. Charge even at a reduced rate would act as a deterrent, and one that would be specially resented at a timewhen there is an urgent need to encourage desirable development like housing, notplace obstacles in its way. To the extent that charge can be set off against claim itmay be tolerated; but even a reduction of 50 per cent, will not avert the difficultieswhich must arise when charge begins to be much greater than claim. Nor, if chargebe reduced to 75 per cent, or 50 per cent., is there any clear principle why it should stand at any particular figure: the process of reduction, once begun, will be difficultto stop. From the point of the revenue, a heavily reduced charge becomes hardlyworth collecting when allowance is made for the cost of collection.23. Development charge is thus too weak an instrument to act as the lyncfi-pin of a permanent settlement. Accordingly the Government have reached theconclusion that a mere adjustment of the existing financial provisions is unlikely toprovide a stable solution; and they have decided that a more radical amendmentmust be made. . &apos;   ,Fart III. The Limited Compensation Scheme24.   In the barest outline, Her Maje.s$y&apos;s Government propose (l) not to pay out the  300 million fund, but to retain the once-for-all reckoningof the .1947 Act by limiting the compensation payable on any piece ofland to the full agreed value of the appropriate claim on the fund;.(2) to pay compensation for planning restrictions only as and when the develop-ment of land is prevented or seriously restricted;.(3) to fix the compensation payable on compulsory acquisition at the currentexisting use value of the land plus the full amount of the agreed claim,both to be paid by the acquiring authority.;(4) to abolish development charge altogether.These proposals may conveniently be called the Limited Compensation Scheme andare set out in the following paragraphs.
Compensation at 1947 Values25. The essence of the Government^ proposals is to turn the &quot; depreciationpayments &quot; of the 1947 Act into compensation payments. They believe that therewill be general agreement that the once-for-all reckoning of compensation effected by the Act of 1947 must be maintained. Unless that is done effective control overthe use of land cannot be maintained, for the cost of compensation, if it always hadto be paid at the peak value, would be crippling. It would also include a largeelement of value created by public effort. The Government will be prepared to pay compensation for loss of development value created in the past up to the point where the 1947 axe fell but not for the loss of development value created in thefuture.26. The limit within which it is proposed that compensation should be paidis 100 per cent, of the claims admitted and agreed by the Central Land Board. Sincethe basis is now to be admittedly a compensation basis it would not be fair to payless than 100 per cent, of the admitted claim where the owner is deprived of alidevelopment value. This principle will be subject to certain modifications (seeparagraph 30).27. It may be argued that it is unfair to limit compensation in this way.Land Which now has a very small claim upon it may at some future date acquireconsiderable development value. Values will tend to follow the plan and theland which acquires this high value will normally be land on which development will be permitted: but there will be exceptions, and some may feel that to limitcompensation in these cases will inflict hardship on the owners refused permission.But such hardship, if it is hardship, is inherent in the Act of 1947 as well as inthe Limited Compensation Scheme: if the pay-out were made now owners would receive nothing for these distant and prospective values. All transactions in landover the past five years have taken place in the full knowledge that the 1947 develop-ment value was the most that anyone could hope to receive by way of compensation from the  300 million fund; indeed, most claimants expected to receive onlya fraction of that value. For the future no one should pay more than currentexisting use value plus 1947 development value for land without first making sure of permission to develop. The value to be placed on the land with the benefit ofthat permission will be a matter for private judgment.Deferment of payment28. There will probably also be general agreement that payment of compen-sation should not be made until damage is actually inflicted. This proposal has in substance been made in several quarters, notably by the Royal Institution ofChartered Surveyors. The intention is that compensation should not be paiduntil there is a real proposal to develop, which is prevented by the refusal of planning permission, or a real need to establish that permission will not be granted. (TheRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors contemplated that claims would also have to be paid when charge was levied; but as Her Majesty&apos;s government propose to abolish charge that does not arise.)Payment on basis of full agreed claim with interest29. As explained, payment will be on the basis of the full agreed claim. TheAct provides that interest should accrue on any sums due to be paid as from theAppointed Day (1st July, 1948). The underlying assumption was that the payments would be made within five years; and since payments are now to be deferredHer Majesty&apos;s Government propose that interest should be allowed to accrue fora further, though limited, period. The duration of this further period is one ofthe several points to which further considerations will be given; but it will certainlyrun to the point at which claims which have already become due where develop-ment has already been prevented or land has been compulsorily acquired are paid.Exclusion from compensation30. It is nOt intended that compensation should be payable in every casein which permission to develop is refused or conditions are attached to a permission.For example, compensation will not be paid for a refusal to allow a change inthe use of a building;* or refusal to allow one type of building rather than another;or refusal to allow development which would place an undue burden on the* With the general abolition of charge there will, of course, be nothing to pay in future when achange of use is permitted.
community, e.g., in the provision of public services; or refusal to allow develop-ment which would endanger public health or safety. It seems reasonable that development of this kind should be prevented without compensation on the general principle of good neighbourliness and public interest; and there is precedent for doing so in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932. The precise limits of theexclusions have still to be worked out.31. Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend that the scrutiny of claims for compen-sation, and the payment of compensation, should be the responsibility of an agency of the central Government; but provision will be made for appeal to an independent tribunal against a decision by the agency that a particular case falls within theexclusions prescribed by the Regulations, and against the assessment of the amountof compensation to be paid on any particular decision, subject always to themaximum of the agreed claim.Basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition32. Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition should be the current existing use value of the land plus the full value of the agreed claim (if any) on the fund. This will mean that an owner whose land is required for a public purpose may receive something less-perhaps in some cases a great deal less than its current market value: but hewill be no worse off than if his land were to be bought under the original Act.To pay an owner on compulsory acquisition something less than he might get ifhe sold privately can be criticised, and no doubt will be criticised, as being harsh.On the other hand, if public authorities were required to pay full market value for land needed for public purposes they would, in many cases, have to pay a priceenhanced by the plan itself or by public improvements made at public expense.It is not possible to separate the value due to these elements from the value dueto chance or to the general trend of development. The owner whose land is com-pulsorily acquired, like the owner of land which is not allowed to be developed,only loses his chance of making a profit. He will receive full value for the existing use and also his claim for 1947 development value (plus accrued interest) whichshould fully cover in most cases more than cover anything he has actually paid for development value. Where a public authority finds that it has to buy landfor which permission to develop has already been obtained and something higherthan 1947 development value paid, they will be required to pay to the owner any additional expenditure which it can be shown that he has incurred on the strengthof the planning permission.Use of Powers of compulsory acquisition33. One result of the changes which Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose willbe a free market in land. This will make it easier for developers to secure the landthey want but there is a danger that the market price of land on which building isto be allowed will rise, perhaps steeply, especially where such land has to be limited by planning (because of agricultural or mineral values, or the desire to restrict thegrowth of towns) in relation to the demand. Whether this will in practice happenmust be uncertain. But it might; and if it did the cost to private developers wouldbe serious, the difference between the price paid by public authorities for their development and the current market price might become too great, and the for-unfortunate owners whose land was allowed to be developed privately would attain aprivileged position which would offend the public conscience.34. Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose, therefore, that local authoritiesshould be empowered and encouraged to buy compulsorily land which is ear-marked in their plans for early development, in order to make it available to privatedevelopers on reasonable terms. Wide powers of acquisition in order to bring landinto development in accordance with the plan already exist in the Act of 1947; but these powers need some simplification to enable local authorities to engage, as necessary, on wide-scale acquisition for the purpose of disposal to any person will-ing to develop in accordance with the provisions of the plan. The usual procedure for compulsory acquisition with the customary safeguards will of course apply,35. The power of the Central Land Board to acquire land will disappear withtheir function of collecting charge. The type of acquisition now contemplated by her Majesty&apos;s Government is very different, in that it will originate in the planningproposals and not in the desire of particular individuals to get particular plots ofland.
Abolition of Development Charge36. From a date to be fixed by legislation no further development chargewill be collected. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered whether this couldbe achieved by Regulation under the existing Act, but they do not think that thatwould be a suitable method of introducing so big a change. The legislation for thispurpose is being introduced immediately. Legislation will also be required (see part IV below) to deal with some of the cases in which charge has already been paid.General37. The new scheme is by no means a wholesale reversal of the old: it isan adaptation of it in the light of experience. Indeed, it could not have been devised had the Act of 1947 never been passed. Under that Act the control of land use has been firmly established and local planning authorities have been able tomake plans for the future development of their areas, which they could not havedone except in the confidence given by the compensation settlement.38. But Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the need to make radicalamendments now is established by the practical difficulties outlined in Part II.And they think that their proposals will retain the essential features of the .1947settlement, while restoring the free market in land (except for land needed for public development, or which it is desired to encourage private persons to develop)and getting rid of one of the obstacles at present inhibiting private persons frombuilding or similar enterprise. There will no doubt be criticism of the scheme; inthis sphere there is certainly no perfect solution. The main criticisms which her majesty&apos;s Government have considered are as follows.39. The new scheme makes no attempt to be self-balancing and does not seek to extract betterment, or anything approximating to betterment. It does not seem to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, however, that there is really any necessaryconnection between the payment of compensation and the collection of betterment;although in the past there has been a tendency to think so. The whole communitybenefits from the control of land use, not merely those who are allowed to develop.Some may argue that for this reason the proper course would be a tax on incrementsin site values. But, if so, it should surely be so designed that it is paid by the man who cashes in on the benefit at the moment of sale and not, like development charge, by the man who initiates the development at the time when he has to bearall the costs involved. The merits and practicability of such a levy may be dis-puted: what is certain is that it is no essential part of the arrangements requiredfor effective control of the use of land and for the payment of fair compensation to those who interests are affected.40. It may be suggested that to make payment of compensation turn on plan-ning decisions is a retrograde step which will adversely affect the quality of planningdecisions. The reply to this is that the mischiefs and inadequacies of plan-ning arrangements before the war arose not from the connection between planning and compensation but from two vital facts: first, that compensation was alocal authority responsibility, second, that it was unlimited. The Act of 1947 made it, in effect, an Exchequer responsibility and limited the total liability. Both theseessential features remain.41. Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not pretend that the Limited compensation scheme will provide equality of treatment as between owners who are allowed todevelop and those who are not, or those whose land is bought compulsorily. Thepresent system does not produce equality in practice and Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment do not believe it to be attainable. In any event, it seems to them an illusionto suppose that equality is synonymous with equity. The terms of compensationproposed are in themselves reasonable, and whilst the man who is refused permis-sion to develop, or whose land is bought compulsorily, will perhaps feel enviousof his neighbour who is left free to realise the current development value of hisland, there will be safeguards in the powers of compulsory acquisition.42. Finally, there is the question of cost. It is impossible to estimate, withany accuracy, the cost of the Limited Compensation Scheme or to compare it withthe cost of carrying out the Act. The Scheme, on one hand, involves the loss ofrevenue from charge. This had, up to 31st August, 1952, brought in  18^ million.It is accruing at the rate of about  8 million a year and that figure would increase as the special categories of land which are free of charge are exhausted.   But it
would, of course, be a very long time indeed before the revenue began to meetthe cost of paying out the  300 million fund with accrued interest. Under theScheme, although there will be a loss of revenue from charge, nothing like  300million will ever have to be paid out because permission to develop will be given,for a good deal of the land covered by claims on the fund, and some claims willnot now be paid (e.g., those applying to existing buildings and those applying toland which the owners never propose to develop). A good deal of money willhave to be paid out in the first few years for land which has already been cora-pulsorily acquired and for land where development has already been prevented;but this will not amount during those years to anything like the net cost of payingout the whole  300 million even if charge were maintained at 100 per cent. a true comparison of the cost of the two schemes would depend on the rate ofdevelopment and, if the Act were to be maintained, on the future of charge. Neithercan accurately be estimated.Part IV. MiscellaneousTechnical Dfaculties43. Claims under Part VI of the 1947 Act were intended to provide a basis for the distribution of the  300 million fund: they relate not to depreciation in thevalue of land itself but to depreciation in interests in land existing in 1948.* Underthe Limited Compensation Scheme, as under all schemes for deferred payment(e.g., that put forward by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors), the title to compensation must run with the land. This gives rise to a number of technical difficulties. There may be changes in the interests concerned between 1948 and thedate when payment has to be made. Again, some claims cover wide areas: as and when these are split into smaller holdings it will be necessary to apportion theclaim in order to provide each with its appropriate compensation quota. the detailed provisions necessary to meet these difficulties are being worked out.44. A difficulty of a more general character arises from the need, under any scheme which provides for compensation to be paid as and when planning permis-sion is refused, to defeat applications for permission made with the sole purpose ofsecuring compensation. Sometimes the proposal will be merely premature development would not naturally have taken place until later; sometimes, aswhere the land is held for recreation or to protect the amenities of adjoiningproperty, it may be wholly fictitious. Intention can seldom be proved or disprovedand cannot therefore be made the test of a &quot; genuine &quot; application. In some cases,particularly where the land is held to safeguard the amenities of a dwelling house,the answer may be to grant the permission which is ostensibly sought. For therest, provision will be made to ensure that no claim for compensation shall liewhen planning permission is refused solely on the grounds that development wouldbe premature. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are considering what further steps should be taken to ensure that payment is only made as and when loss is sustained.It may be desirable to provide that in specified circumstances payment of the claim in full shall confer an option to acquire the land.45. Provision will also have to be made for the registration of claims for compensation; for repayment of compensation if a planning decision is altered anddevelopment is after all allowed; for scrutiny of decisions by local planning authorities which involve payment of compensation where the Government whohave to pay do not feel able to accept the decision; and for a variety of othermatters.Transitional Arrangements46. Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to repay to anyone holding the rele-vant claim on the  300 million fund any development charge he has already paid,whether the charge exceeded the claim or vice versa. This will, in the normal case,extinguish so much of the claim as related to the land which was developed. they also propose to pay in full with accrued interest all claims (apportioned where necessary) relating to land which has been compulsorily acquired. Immediatepayment in full would also be appropriate where permission to develop the land* Thus there may be two or more claims in respect of the same piece of land, representingfreehold and leasehold interests.
has been revoked (as has happened in the Green Belt around London), or whereland has already been sterilised by the refusal of permission.47. Difficult cases arise where the person who paid the charge does not hold the claim, generally because the land has changed hands since the Act came into force. Here the equity of the matter depends entirely on the price paid forthe land. If this was no more than existing use value there is no case for repayingthe charge to the developer: payment ought to be made to the owner who sold.Where the developer paid the full unrestricted value for the land he has a case for repayment, even though what he did was contrary to the intention of the Act andthe advice given by the Central Land Board : certainly the owner who has already received full value has no case even though he holds the claim. These, however,are the extreme types of case : in the majority of cases the price paid has beensomewhere between restricted and unrestricted value. Here the fair course wouldbe to divide the payment between developer and claim-holder according to theprice at which the land changed hands. To do this would involve an enquiry intothe facts of individual transactions and may not prove administratively practicable.Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not therefore feel able at this stage to give any undertaking as to how they will deal with these cases. They are also considering what adjustments would be appropriate where a vendor has sold land without thebenefit of the claim and no development incurring charge has taken place.Legislation Programme &apos;48. Owing to the pressure of Parliamentary business and the intricate draftingwhich some of the provisions may require it will not be possible to introduce themain Bill embodying the Limited Compensation Scheme before the autumn of1953.; Meanwhile, as already stated in paragraph 36, Her Majesty&apos;s government propose to introduce immediately a Bill to relieve the Central Land Board of theduty to collect charge. This Bill will also suspend the obligation laid on theTreasury by the present Act to distribute the  300 million fund by 1st July next year.
