us(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALG. (52) 313 COPY NO.30th SEPTEMBER, 1952.CABINETKOREA: ARMISTICE TALKSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues the following note on the present situationin the Korean Armistice talks.2. The United Nations Command&apos;s proposals on 28th September, at Panmunjom, the United Nations Commandnegotiators proposed to the Communists that, after the conclusion of an armistice:-(i) all prisoners should be taken in groups to a mutually agreed placein the demilitarised zone and there be given the free choice of going north or south, if desired under the supervision of the International Committee of theRed Cross, joint Red Cross teams, or military observers from both sides;  or(ii) those prisoners refusing repatriation should be taken to the demilitarised zone, freed from military restraint and interviewed individuallyby representatives of neutral countries, under observation similar to that in(i) above;  or(iii) all prisoners should be taken to the demilitarised zone wherethey would be checked against lists, it being understood that, when this had been done, all obligation to release and repatriate them would be considered to have been fulfilled.3. These proposals are in fact variations on a suggestion whichSardar Panikker, the then Indian Ambassador in Peking, reported thatChou En-Lai had made to him in June this year, but which theChinese laterspecifically disowned as unacceptable.   The initial Communist reaction to them has not been encouraging.   The truce talks have now been adjourned untilthe 8th October.4. Alternative Proposal not adopted by United States GovernmentThe United States Government considered putting forward, simultaneous -ly with the proposals outlined above, another proposal of a quite different type,which was to have been  is follows:   that both sides should carry out all thearticles of the armistice agreement already agreed on between them (i. e.the complete armistice agreement except for the prisoner of war article);that the United Nations would return 83,000 prisoners (i. e. all those willing to-1-
go) to Communist control;  that the Communists would return 12,000-oddprisoners (i. e. all the United Nations prisoners) to United Nations control;that there should then be an immediate cease-fire and armistice in Korea;and that the question of what to do with prisoners whose status remained in dispute after the cease-fire should be the subject of later negotiations,hi fact an armistice would then be secured by the two sides agreeing to differon the disposal of prisoners of war refusing repatriation,5, This proposal derived from one which had been put by us to theState Department at an earlier date.   Although in practice it probably wouldhave had little chance of acceptance by the Communists, at least it represented a fresh approach to the deadlock on prisoners of war and its rejection by the communists would have been a further propaganda point in our favour.6. The United States Government, however, finally decided not to put the proposal forward, for the following reason.   Unless the Communistsaccepted it in the clear knowledge that they were in effect abandoning theirinsistence on forcible repatriation    there would be, in the American view(particularly in the view of the United States military), a serious risk thatafter the armistice had been signed it might eventually be violated by the communists.   The United States Government recognised that this rink exists in any case and that the Communists might violate an armistice over an issue such as withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea.   Theynevertheless considered that it would be highly dangerous to give the communists an additional important pretext for breaking the armistice byleaving such a delicate issue hanging over unresolved.7. This argument rests on the assumption that the Communists might accept the proposal in the genuine belief that the United Nations Command had abandoned the principle of voluntary repatriation.   It would, however, be perfectly feasible, in putting the proposal forward, to make it clear to the communists that this was not the case.   On such a basis, the proposal,admittedly, would be unlikely to appeal to the Communists,   It would, however,be at least more likely to do so than the proposals now put forward, the principlof which has already been rejected by the Communists.   It would also havethe advantages set out in paragraph 5 above.8. I should be glad of the views of my colleagues on the question whetherif the Communists confirm their rejection of the latest proposals by the united nations Command, we should again urge upon the United States and old commonwealth Governments the desirability of putting forward a proposal on the lines of that discussed in paragraph 4 above, explaining to theUnited States Government why we have not been convinced by their objectionsto it.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,30th September, 1952.
