if. ,W confidential, (52) 328 COPY NO.     ^10th OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETMETHODS OF BORROWING BY LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the ProposalI shall be glad if my colleagues will consider the case for a changein the present system of providing the local authorities with their capitalfinance.   My proposal is that the law requiring the authorities to borrow fromthe Exchequer through the Local Loans Fund should not be renewed when itexpires in December 1952, and that in 1953 the amount they borrow from theExchequer should be limited to such provision as we make for that purpose in the Budget, leaving them to raise the balance of their requirements bymortgage loans and issues of stock.The Present system.        The present system is governed by Section 1 of the Local AuthoritiesLoans Act, 1945 - which Section will expire on 31st December, 1952 unlessrenewed by inclusion in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.    Under it,local authorities must borrow from the Exchequer through the Local loans fund unless authorised by the Treasury to do otherwise.    In practice theauthorities are authorised to borrow on private mortgage within limitsthat have permitted them in recent years to raise some 20 per cent of theirloans each year from sources other than the Local Loans Fund.    But therehave been no stock issues in the market by local authorities since the warexcept conversion issues, and the last of these was in 1948.    As long as theauthorities are obliged to borrow from the Local Loans Fund, there is acorresponding obligation on the part of the Government to lend them what-ever sums they require to raise in order to meet approved commitments.For each year after 1948-49 the actual loans by the Government required under this commitment have substantially exceeded the provision madebelow-the-line in the Budget.3.        The provision in this year&apos;s Budget is  360 millions.   The best estimate that can be made, based on the figures of advances so far made tolocal authorities, suggests that there may well be an excess over theBudget figure of the order of  75 millions.Limited Objective4..        The proposal has a limited objective.    It is not a proposal touse the market to control the volume of local authority borrowing.    Localauthorities borrow to meet commitments already approved by the responsibleDepartments and covered by the appropriate sanctions.    lam not suggesting that we should throw the local authorities on to the market to stop themborrowing altogether or to reduce their borrowing by forcing them to bid
for capital in the market at penal rates of interest.    On the contrary,I am clear that as long as local authorities incur capital expenditure under Government authority, they are entitled to an assurance that inorder to finance that expenditure they will be given access either to theExchequer or to the market and, if the latter, that the terms will be appropriate to their standing as public authorities.5.        It would be wrong, therefore, to regard the new system proposed as a substitute for control over the volume of capital expenditure bylocal authorities.    But I believe it would provide a useful support forthat control.    I have said that the authorities must be given a generalassurance of access to the market on appropriate terms.    But theknowledge that certain authorities in due course will have to come to terms with the market should have a restrictive and sobering effect upon them when they plan their capital expenditure.    It might also make them more careful on their current expenditure.Advantages6.       The following advantages would result from the change.7.     First, it would have a healthy effect on public opinion both athome and abroad.    At home, we shall find that the plans of the localauthorities are framed in a more realistic way.    Abroad, the publishedfigures of Exchequer issues under the present system have done damage to Government credit and to confidence.    The change will not in itselfreduce the volume of local authority borrov/ing.    Nor, given outstandingcommitments, will it reduce the rate of Exchequer lending for aconsiderable time.    But the announcement, of the change would beregarded as a step in the right direction.8.      Secondly, we avoid the necessity for re-enacting the statutory provision obliging local authorities to borrow from the Local Loans Fund.This obligation is provided in Section I of the Local  AuthoritiesLoans Act, 1945.    As originally enacted, the provision was limited induration to five years and should have lapsed on 31st December, 1950,but it has twice been prolonged for a year at a time, by the expiring laws Continuance Acts of 1950 and 19*1.    The local authorities are on record as wanting Section 1 of the 1945 Act to lapse so that they regaintheir freedom.    If we continue the present system we have to justifythe legislation to Parliament;  and before we provide for it in the nextExpiring Laws Bill, we shall have to negotiate with the authorities aboutthe terms on which we prolong their obligation to borrow from theExchequer.    This means an extension of the present practice under whichthey are left free within wide limits to borrow from the Exchequer or outside, as they like, while the Government must lend them whatever they require.    If Section 1 of the 1945 Act lapses we are relieved of the need to legislate, for we shall still have all the control over the form of localauthority borrowing that we require - because they, like other borrowers,are subject to the provision for capital issues control in the borrowing Act, 1946.    On the other hand, the Government would regaindiscretion to lend from the Local Loans Fund such amounts as we may decide on grounds of Government policy.9.       Thirdly, we need the change in order to avoid the embarrassment to the Budget resulting from the existing system under which theprovision for loans to local authorities is an open figure not capableof restriction to the estimate.    We have already seen this year what
happens when issues to local authorities substantially outrun the estimate.The figures published weekly have done damage to Government credit, andto confidence.    The Exchequer has been obliged to meet the deficit by adding to the floating debt, and the consequent increase in the liquidityof the banks weakens our monetary policy and endangers our controlover credit.    The issues to local authorities represent the lion&apos;s share of provision for expenditure below-the-line in the Budget(  360 millions out of a total below-the-line of  612 millions in1952/3).    We must r egain control over this item as part of our newmonetary technique.Objections10.   I appreciate that we shall encounter some criticism both inParliament and from some local authorities.   Most of the objection willspring from the fallacy that we intend to penalise some of the authorities by leaving them to the mercy of a stringent stock market.   The answer istwofold.   First, authorities which cannot be accommodated by the local loans Fund will be given access to the market to borrow to meet approvedcommitments on terms appropriate to their standing;  and secondly,this does not mean that we are discriminating against, the authorities whogo to the market, since we already charge the full market rate on loans from the Local Loans Fund and shall continue to do so.Negotiations with Local Authorities11, Once the decision of principle is taken to limit the issues from theLocal Loans Fund to the amount provided in the Budget we shall need to negotiate with the local authorities on the arrangements for sharing outthe limited sum.   It will probably be necessary to meet the whole of therequirements of the smaller authorities from the Local Loans Fund,   Therequirements of the larger authorities will then be covered if the resourcesof the Local Loans Fund are supplemented by mortgage borrowing and by arranging for a small number of substantial stock issues by the LondonCounty Council and a few other large authorities of recognised creditstanding,   I recognise that these arrangements will depend upon the futureprovision in the Local Loans Fund being enough to reduce the balance to befound by stock issues to manageable proportions.   It is, of course, too early to decide on the figure for loans to local authorities in next year&apos;s Budget:but if the system is changed as I suggest, I shall take care that theprovision for local loans is sufficient to keep the balance to be found bystock issues to manageable proportions.Re c ommendation11. I ask my colleagues to agree:-(a) to allow Section 1 of the Local Authorities Loans Act, 1945to lapse on 31st December, 1952 by omitting it from theforthcomingExpiring Laws Bill;(b) to announce this decision when the Expiring Laws Bill is published early in November, coupled with the governments intention in future (starting in the financial year 1953/54) to limit issues from the Local Loans Fund to the provision in the Budgetj(c) to inform the local authorities immediately of this decision and to open negotiations with them on future arrangements, with the object of settling the arrangements in time to indicatethem in outline when the decision is announced in early NovembeTreasury Chambers, S.W.1. R.A0B.10th October, 1952.
