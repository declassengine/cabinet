mCONFIDENTIAL^Jt (52) 329 COPY NO. )S  ^10th OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETGERMAN REQUEST FOR THE     .RETURN OF THEIR CAPTURED ARCHIVESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.At the end of the last war a great mass of German documents fell intoAllied hands.   They included the archives of the German Army, Navy and AirForce, of the German Foreign Ministry, and many technical and scientificdocuments.   Possession of them was divided by agreement between the UnitedStates and British Governments but they were, to be held for the most partin joint custody.   The principle of mutual consultation between the Britishand United States Governments, to which the Departments of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment concerned attach great importance, on all questions relating tothese papers, was agreed and has been generally observed.2. On 17th June, 1950, the Chancellor of the German Federal Republic,Dr. Adenauer, quoting a resolution passed by the Bundestag on 11th May,19508 wrote to the Allied High Commission requesting the return of thecaptured German documents.   During the recent negotiations for theContractual Agreement the question was raised again, and it was agreedthat an exchange of letters should take place under which the AlliedGovernments would agree to discuss this question with the Federal GermanGovernment.   This exchange of letters has been effected, and theGermanshave notified the Allied High Commission of the names of their representatives inthe discussions, and have requested that discussions should begin at an early date.3. The German Foreign Ministry archives have always been treatedseparately from the military and technical collections.   From an early dateafter the war the State Department and the Foreign Office adopted the view thatthey were custodians of these documents for a future German Government andthat, when the requirements of the historians engaged on publishing selectionsfrom them in the series Documents on German Foreign Policy had been satisfied, they would ultimately return the whole collection to the Germans,As a consequence of this view, with which the French Government as a partnerin the publication project concurred, and in response to the federal chancellor&apos;s request, the Allied High Commission made an offer to the Germansabout these documents on 6th July, 1951.   This  included (1) the loan to theFederal Government of all microfilms made and to be made;  (2) a liaison officer in this country with free access to the documents;  (3) a German Editorto be associated with the British, American and French Editors;   (4) the return of certain categories of documents including the personnel files of the formerGerman Foreign Ministry - these have since been returned - and (5) the return of the pre-1914 papers.    To this offer no direct reply has been received from theFederal Government but it is proposed that negotiations should be opened withthem in the near future on the basis of the offer and the United States and french governments have already agreed to this course.
4. The question of the return of the military and scientific and technicaldocuments presents much greater difficulty.   These documents are not only^important for the official War Historians but there are serious securitytreasons against returning many categories of them, including some categories of technical and scientific documents.   The question has been consideredby the interested Departments and their agreed proposals were given general approval by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 4th September,,5. For their part the Departments concerned would have preferred tomake no concessions to the German request, but they have agreed to offercertain concessions to meet the view presented by the Foreign Office thatit is of considerable importance politically to grant such concessions to the Germans on this matter as may be possible.   Their proposals thereforelay down that whilst there are certain categories of material which, for security or other reasons, cannot be returned to the Germans &quot;within any foreseeabletime&quot;, the great bulk of the documents could be returned in due course,6. The Departments therefore considered that the general principle thatthe captured archives should ultimately be returned to their country of origincould be conceded, but that, in discussion with the Germans, this principle should be expressed merely as an intention to return them when they are nolonger being used for defence or historical purposes.   A definite guarantee of return, unaccompanied by a time limit, would merely invite charges ofbreach of faith, if the documents were withheld beyond a period which isregarded by the Germans as reasonable.   On the other hand, it is not possibleto set an arbitrary limit to the period within which they, or any substantial part of them, will cease to be of practical value to us.   Moreover, the documents,which reveal German strategy and tactics during the war in comprehensivedetail, could not fail for many years to come to be of great assistance to anypotential enemy of the Western Powers and in particular of this country, andtheir retention in this country or in the United States, even when their value for purposes of study and research has been exhausted, may under the conditions prevailing at the time be a wise and necessary precaution.   It seems important,for this reason alone, that the right to retain them should not be relinquished.7. On this point the Chiefs of Staff Committee stated at the meeting referred to in paragraph 4 above that &quot;the question of return of CapturedArchives to a defeated enemy country was one of principle for which there wasno known precedent.   It was therefore most desirable that Ministerial approvalshould be obtained to this principle&quot;.   The principle can be defended on theground that such records contain the basic history of the country&apos;spast and that without them its history cannot be written.   Moreover permanent deprivationof the national archives would create a permanent grievance,8, It is ovident that, before discussions with the Germans are opened,discussions should take place with the United States and French governments to arrive at a common policy, and a proposal for such discussions has alreadybeen made to the United States Government,   It was suggested   in this proposal that the discussions should be held either in London or Washington, preferablythe former, and that the host government should invite the French Governmentto take part in them.   The Department of Her Majesty&apos;s Government interestedin this question are most anxious to maintain the principle of joint consultationwith the United States Government.   It is also in the highe,st degree necessaryto determine as precisely as possible, before discussions with the Germansbegin, the specific categories of documents which must be excepted from theprinciple of return and to secure agreement with the other two Governments onthese exceptions.
I therefore recommend:-(1) that negotiations for the return of the German Foreign Ministry-Archives should be opened as proposed in paragraph 3 above;(2) that German military, scientific and technical documentsshould be dealt with as proposed in paragraphs 7 and 8,A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.I.10th October, 1952.
