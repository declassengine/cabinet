SECRET/C. (52) 310 COPY NO.    Vp1st OCTOBER, 1952.CABINET1DISMISSALS OF labour at THE GLOSTER AIRCRAFT FACTORY.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.The revision of aircraft requirements, following upon the acceptanceof the Chiefs of Staff review of global strategy, has resulted in the cancellation by the Air Ministry of production orders for 341 Meteor aircraftout of the total remaining programme of 817.2, These cancellations will oblige the manufacturers, the GlosterAircraft Company, to reduce the labour force of their factory at Gloucesterfrom 5,400 to about 2,900 over the next few months.3, Apart from the unemployment problem which this involves, I amconcerned about the possible delays it may cause in the deliveries of the newGloster Javelin all-weather fighter.   The production programme for this aircraft would require the firm to start recruiting labour again towards theend of 1953, building up to a peak of 5,900 by March, 1955.   There is,however, no certainty that having once dispersed the labour, it will be possibleto attract it back in the numbers and at the speed needed.4. Moreover, the publicity which these large-scale dismissals will receive, is bound to create a feeling of insecurity throughout the aircraft industry generally and may have a serious effect upon its ability to recruitlabour in the future.5. I feel that theCabinet would wish to consider these possible repercussions before the cancellations are put into effect.D.S.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.1st OCTOBER, 1952.
