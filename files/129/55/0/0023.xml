(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 323 COPY NO. /6th OCTOBER, 1952.cabinet national SERVICE policy memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National Service.An adjournment motion about the call-up of agricultural workerswhich is to be moved soon after Parliament reassembles raises broadquestions of National Service policy.   I shall probably be asked to restore thecomplete protection of agricultural workers.   It will be argued that if it is right, under the scheme recently announced, to defer the calling up of menin the engineering and shipbuilding industries engaged on important exportwork, it is equally right to refrain from calling up men in agriculture whose work saves food imports.   A second question likely to be raised, in view ofMir. ShinwelPs recent speeches, is whether the two years&apos; period of whole-timeNational Service cannot now be shortened.   I should like my colleagues to approve the line I propose to take on these points which is, on the first, that nofurther extension of deferment can be contemplated, and, on the second, thatI can see no prospect of being able to shorten the period of whole-timeNational Service in the foreseeable future.2. As regards deferment, the position is that only coalminers (about10,000 per age group), merchant seamen (about 4^000) and a few hundredscientists and professional engineers working on projects of exceptionalimportance and urgency have their call-up deferred indefinitely and so escapecall-up altogether if they stay on the work in question until they are 26.Mien employed on small farms or as stockmen on larger farms can have theircalling up deferred, if various conditions are satisfied, until the farmerhas found a replacement or can otherwise manage v/ithout them.   Theseagricultural deferments are running at the rate of about 8,000 per age groupout of about 18,000 in the field.   Many of them will probably, in practice, be renewed until the men pass out of liability.   As regards engineering and shipbuilding, in order to keep the numbers who might be granteddeferment in so wide a field within bounds, the arrangements recently introduced have been limited to men belonging to specified highly skilledoccupations and working on stiper-priority defence projects or designatedcategories of export work.   Moreover, in order to make it clear from the outset that these young men are not being granted exemptions defermentis granted for the specific period of two years, and the present intention isthat, after two years, the young men should, if medically fit, be called up.The numbers who will be granted deferment under these schemes cannot be precisely estimated but may be of the order of about 3,000 out of approximately23,000 skilled men in engineering and metal working occupations at presentcalled up annually.3. I regard it as imperative that National Service in peacetime shouldbe required, as nearly as possible, of all fit young men alike.   This is for two reasons:&quot;
(1)    Two years1 National Service, while not without its advantages,represents for most young men a substantial and unwelcome interruption of their normal civilian lives and careers.   Moreover, men called up also have a liability for 3\ years&quot; part-time service during whichthey are liable for 60 days&apos;  training and to be mobilised immediately in the event of war.   In my view, we shall not be able to maintaingeneral public support for peacetime conscription - which, in somecases, involves a high degree of personal hardship - unless we make asfew exceptions as possible and confine these to closely defined fieldswhich the general public will readily accept as justified.   evidence in support of this view is found in recent leading articles in the&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and some other responsible newspapers.(2)   Every concession made inevitably leads to demands for others forwhich an almost equally strong case can often be made out.   But the manpower needs of the Services leave no room for any further concessions of any size.   The extent to which the Services will need todraw upon National Service manpower over the next few years is notyet finally settled, but the probability is that while there may be a smallsurplus during the remainder of the current financial year, we shallbe short of manpower to meet the requirement of the Services over thenext three years.   If further concessions were made the manpower needsof the Services could be met only by increasing the period of whole-timeNational Service for the young men who are called up.   This step would not only be highly unpopular of itself, but would increase publicresentment about the favoured position of the young men whosedeferment made the increase necessary.4. As regards agriculture, when allowance is made for medicalrejects, less than half the men in the field are called up.   Agriculture is already in a favoured position compared with every other industry except coalminingand the Merchant Navy and is losing only about 8,000 young men a year - or16,000 over the two years - out of some 900,000 men (including workingfarmers) on the land.5. As regards Mr. Shinwell&apos;s suggestion, as there are not likely to be enough National Service men, even with two years&apos; whole-time National Service,we clearly cannot contemplate shortening the period.   Apart from thisdecisive consideration, any shorter period would be highly uneconomical as itwould greatly reduce the amount of useful service the Services would obtain from young men after they had finished their military training.   Moreover,owing to pledges given io Parliament as to the minimum age and trainingperiod for men sent to these theatres, it would not be practicable to sendNational Service men to distant places like Korea or Malaya as they wouldhave to be sent back again only a few months after they arrived.   The burdenin these operational theatres would then fall even more heavily than it doesat present on the Regulars with consequent ill-effects on morale.6. There are other major arguments against shortening the period of whole-time service, the principal of which are these.   It would mean anaggravation of t e present shortage of men of longer service and experience in the Forces, and especially of junior N.C.Os. , of which the National Serviceintake produces a considerable proportion.   It would impose a further strain on the training organisations of the Services, owing to the quicker turnoverof intakes.   And, finally, any reduction in the two year period of whole-time service would inevitably constitute a disincentive to the large numbers of young men liable for National Service who are at the present time taking thenew three and four year short service regular engagements.7.
