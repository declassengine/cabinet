IS M)CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.^| [1     C.(52) 335 COPY NO.14TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETGEORGE BUNDOCKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs[1 George Bundock was employed as a storeman at H. M. Embassyat Moscow.   In March, 1948, he was accused before a Soviet Court of havinginfected a Soviet girl with venereal disease. (There is reason to think thathe may have done so, though not knowingly.)    Mr. Bevin, who was ForeignSecretary at the time, was concerned at the effect on the morale of theI Embassy staff if Bundock was surrendered and convicted and instructedhim not to appear before the Soviet Court.   He was condemned in absentiato eighteen months&apos; imprisonment and a fine which Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have said they are ready to pay.2. Soviet law does not accord diplomatic immunity to junior Embassypersonnel.   The practice of States in this respect is not uniform and wecannot say that the Soviet practice is contrary to an established rule ofinternational law.3. Bundock is now thirty years old.   He has been a prisoner in theEmbassy compound for more than four years.   During that time his casehas been taken up personally by Mr. Bevin with Mr. Vyshinsky and also bysuccessive Ambassadors in Moscow.   The Soviet Government have been .uncompromising in their insistence that Bundock must surrender to theSoviet Court and in their refusal to give any undertaking that, if he did so,I he would be pardoned or expelled.   On my instructions H. M, Ambassadorrecently made a further attempt with Mr. Vyshinsky; not only did he not meetwith any success, but Mr. Vyshinsky stated that Bundock was guilty ofcontempt of court in not having surrendered earlier, and it is conceivablethat this might result in some increase of the original sentence.4. I see no prospect of arranging an exchange for Bundock and thealternatives seem to be between his remaining indefinitely inside theEmbassy compound, or surrendering to the Soviet Court.   I propose toinstruct H. M. Ambassador to advise him that the latter course may be in hisbest interest while making it clear that, if he chooses to do so, he is free toremain on at the Embassy.   If Bundock surrenders, I shall instructH. M. Ambassador to make an immediate appeal for clemency and in support^^HIJ of Bundock&apos;s own appeal to do all he can to persuade the Soviet authoritiesrelease him.5. I recognise that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will incur criticism as^^llfel       tne result of their failure to protect Bundock but however distasteful thismay be, I consider that in his interests the course I am recommending is theonly right one. ^^fl] Foreign Office, S.W.I.,14TH OCTOBER, 1953.
