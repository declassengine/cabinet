Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of ..............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 3203rd October, 1952CABINETDEFENCE AND ECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroductionWe were all agreed when we took office that the defence programme whichwe inherited was beyond the nation&apos;s means. It was based on assumptions aboutAmerican aid and the strength of our economy which have since been proved false.The programme would have involved a defence budget of  1,650 million in 1952-53.We cut this back to  1,462 million, and within this total we limited expenditure onmetal goods to  460 million.2. These reductions were- not enough. In the Spring we directed Depart-ments to adjust the programme, so as to contribute  40 million to the balance ofpayments in 1952-53, by liberating steel and diverting arrnaments to export. Aslong ago as May we decided to review the further stages of the defence programme,both to make more metal goods available for export and to reduce1 overseas expenditure.3. These efforts to deal with the situation this year have necessarily beenpiecemeal.  They have not produced the results which we hoped for:  (a) Some Defence Departments are finding it difficult to keep within theirvoted provision: we may be asked to consider at least one substantialSupplementary.(b) Defence production of metal goods has increased by rather more thantotal metal-goods production: the load is now likely to reach an annual rate of  500 million towards the end of the year.(c) Service Departments estimates of military expenditure overseas in 1953-54show an increase of roughly  50 million (about 40 per cent.). this includes  30 million for Germany.u 4. In the Economic Debate at the end of July, the Prime Minister and I,with the agreement of the Cabinet, assured the House that it would be possible to limit the demands made by defence on the engineering industry so as to set free a valuable part of its capacity for the expansion of our civil exports. I have framedmy conclusions in paragraphs 14-16 below after re-reading the speeches we madeon that occasion.Minister of Defence&apos;s proposals. The Minister of Defence was good enough to discuss his Paper (C (52) 316)with me before he put forward his proposals. I recognise the very thorough and careful examination which he has given to the subject, and the grounds on whichhe feels compelled to propose a Defence Budget of no less than  1,645 million in1953-54 rising to  1,688 million in 1954-55, and rising yet again to  1,698 million in 1955-56. The corresponding metal-using loads are  485 million,  540 million and  550 million.43005
6. These figures do not include the defence efforts of the Civil Departments.These will add a further  65 million to  70 million a year (including  20 millionfurther load on the metal-using industries) or  200 million over the three years.There is nothing included here for shelters. Most of the items are of great direc\importance to the defence effort. e.g., the communications network for &quot; ROTOR &quot;(the Control and Reporting System), emergency port and oil installations, measuresto safeguard essential services, fire-fighting equipments, emergency hospital services, &amp;c. The Minister of Defence&apos;s figures also exclude Ministry of Supplyassistance to industry and expenditure on nuclear research and stockpiling.The Budgetary Problem7. It is my duty to look at defence expenditure not in isolation but in relationto our whole economic position. Already in the first half-year the ExchequerAccount shows a larger deficit than usual. We are spending more than we expectedthis year, and, with rising expenditure, we shall start next year with a considerablerisk of inflation. The indications so far for next year are unfavourable, withdebt interest rising, capital for local authorities outrunning the estimates, andfurther large rises in social service expenditure threatened in departmental fore-casts. This will in itself present a serious problem and if in addition there is asubstantial increase in defence expenditure we shall only be able to avoid inflationby making substantial reductions, involving major decisions of policy over the field of public expenditure as a whole. The alternative of a heavy increase of taxation,the bulk of which would have to be found from income tax, would be a reversal ofpolicy which we ought not to contemplate. To find the extra money asked forby the Minister of Defence even in 1953 would mean, if it were wholly by wayof income tax, another Is. in the  . I need not dwell upon the atrophying effects oftaxation even at its present level. It stifles the very virtues enterprise, initiative,thrift on which we must rely for rescue from our perils.8. I am again forced to the conclusion which I have repeated consistently tomy colleagues since we took office, and particularly in the papers which I circulatedlast May (C (52) 166, 172 and 173), that in total we are trying to do far more than our resources permit. If my colleagues are convinced that we must.carry on thedefence programme at its present level, then there must be adequate reductions inour efforts in other directions. If, to go further, they are convinced that nothingless than the Minister of Defence&apos;s proposals will meet the situation, then, of course,the reductions in other directions must be so much the more severe. (In other words, if, as regards defence, we go partly over to a war effort, then, on the rest ofthe field, we must go partly over to a war economy.Balance of Payments9. The gravity of the aggregate defence load on the balance of payments(over  700 million a year) is described in the Appendix.10. In the last twelve months there has been a marked improvement in our balance of payments. This is mainly due to the vigorous measures we have taken,such as the import cuts, but it is also thanks to the improvement in the terms oftrade and to the aid which we have received from America. These helpful factorscannot be relied on indefinitely. In particular, unless there is some change in theAmerican outlook under the new administration, we are unlikely to receive aid from that quarter on the same scale and in the same form as has benefited our economy hitherto. It is, moreover, only in the last half of 1952 that we expect tobe in balance with the non-sterling world on current account and it is only fromthis point we can start building our reserves. Failure to maintain a strong exchange position will jeopardise the whole economy. ; Our defence efforts will then be undermined. Moreover, we shall be unable to fulfil our commitments to theCommonwealth and we shall thus forfeit the opporunity to give them the moralleadership for which they are entitled to look to us.11. An expensive solution of our balance of payments problem depends uponincreasing our exports. That means, more than anything else, increased exports bythe metal-using industry. Although, as. the Minister of Defence points out inparagraph 15. of his paper, total metal goods output is  3,500 to  4,000 million ayear, over  1,600 million of this consists of spare parts and consumer goods. a defence load of  485 million in 1953-54 will be about one-quarter of the residue.This residue is the heavier sectors of the engineering industry which provide our
best exports and essential home investment requirements. I concluded inC. (52) 173 that we could not safely devote to defence in 1953 and 1954 more thaxi:\about  400 million worth of metal goods at the prices then ruling. I then made^certain assumptions about production and exports which subsequent events haveshown to be in general by no means too pessimistic. Certain adverse developmentssuch as a lower export performance by some non-metal goods, and even by someclasses of metal consumer goods, look like making us even more dependent on the heavier sectors of the engineering industry for our exports.12. I can therefore find no ground for altering the broad conclusion that anyrising level of defence production would impede exports by that sector of engineer-ing with the best continuing export prospects. We cannot abandon our exporttarget at the first sign of sales difficulties, particularly at a time when the Common-wealth Conference is considering proposals which would increase our commitments to finance development in the Commonwealth. Apart from any new commitments,it is necessary for us to pay our way by consistently exporting more than we import,so that a balance on current account is available to meet our existing liabilities.Germany13. As the Minister of Defence points out, we have maintained and continueto maintain publicly that the United Kingdom Budget and Balance of payments are in no condition to accept any additional load in respect of Germany: and thereis certainly no authority from the Cabinet to accept it, or any part of it. I agree,however, that it is realistic in our defence planning to make some provision againstthe contingency of our not succeeding in getting the whole of our costs in Germanymet from outside sources. I agree to take  30 million in 1953-54 and  35 million in each of the two subsequent years as planning figures for this purpose. I feel thatthis course is justified by the consideration that Germany, though it may constitute a fresh financial commitment, is not a fresh military one. Any additional expendi-ture on Germany which we may be forced to accept over and above these figuresmust not only be covered within the total of the defence budget but balanced either by further savings in other overseas military expenditure or by further limitation ofthe load of defence on the metal-using industries.Conclusions14. As I have indicated in paragraph 8 above it will be necessary, if thedefence effort is to be sustained at its present level, let alone increased, to secureretrenchment in other sectors of Government expenditure. Provided my colleagues are prepared to accept the implications of this, I consider that we could face thefinancial consequences of allowing defence expenditure in 1953-54 to continue at the present level. But planning must clearly proceed on the basis that this isthe maximum, not only for 1953-54, but for the two subsequent financial yearsof the period now under review. I refer to costs in the next paragraph. I agreethat the figure should be adjusted upwards to take account of the new impositionson Service Votes which the Minister of Defence mentions and which do not involve any real increase in the defence burden. These additions amount to  57 million in 1953-54. With the additional  30 million for Germany mentioned in para-graph 13 above I reach a total figure for 1953-54 of  1,549 million, say 1,550 million.15. I recognise that a defence total of  1,550 million in 1953-54 and the twosubsequent years might have to be adjusted to take account of variations in costs,upwards and downwards, -as time goes on. But such adjustments cannot beautomatic and should be considered on their merits in the circumstances at thetime and having regard to the causes underlying the variations. I can go thus far.as regards possible adjustments of the total, but 1 cannot entertain the suggestion&apos;made in the Working Party&apos;s Report (not, however, repeated in the Ministerscovering Paper) that the Defence Budget should be increased to take account ofexpenditure by the&quot; Services on equipment which will not how be completed or willbe surplus to requirements.16.   As regards the metal-using load, I consider that  400 million is the mostwe ought to afford.   I am prepared to risk  450 million ( 470 million with theinclusion of civil defence requirements), though this must hamper the export drive.
To the extent that we go above this level, it will be necessary to make compensatingadjustments elsewhere in the economy particularly in the import programme to off-set the loss of exports of engineering goods.Summary17. (a) Decisions are overdue. The right ones must be taken immediately if theyare not to be too late.(b) We are attempting to do too much.  If the Defence Programme is to be sustained at its present level, there must be retrenchment in other expenditure of national resources.(c) On the understanding that the neessary compensatory adjustments aremade, the Defence Budget can remain at its present levei, with certainbook-keeping additions and an extra  30 million to take account ofGermany.  That is,  1,550 million in all.(d) Within a Defence Budget of  1,550 million, defence claims on the metal-using industries must be limited to  450 million ( 470 million includingcivil defence); and every effort must be made to reduce military expenditure abroad.(e) We must not plan now for any greater burden of defence in 1954-55 andin 1955-56.(/) The most that can be allowed, even as a planning assumption, for germany is about  30 million. Any excess over this must be coyered, within theDefence Budget, by savings on other expenditure directly affecting thebalance of payments.(g) Anything more than the current level of expenditure means moving towards a war economy,with radical revision of our social and economic policies.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd October, 1952.APPENDIXLoad of Defence on the Balance of payments. My colleagues should be aware of how much of the Defence Budgetimpacts on our balance of payments. This may be seen from the following Table.2. , ( million)		Estimate	Estimate	1951	1952	1953Metal goods for Defence	300	450	450*Imports   of  machinery   and			manufactures     ...      .;.	28	82	33Direct overseas military expen-			ditures     ...      ...	122	143	1781	450	675	661Defence Budget financial years             1,132 1,462 1,5501951-52 1952-53 1953-54* At March 1952 prices.t Includes  20 million only for Germany in calendar year 1953.This does not represent the full cost of defence to our balance of payments. Thereare other items, such as, strategic stockpiling, oil for Forces in the United Kingdomand imports of raw materials for manufacture of defence non-metal goods.3. Even on the foregoing figures (which are based on the lower levels ofexpenditure indicated in paragraphs 14-16 of the Paper and not the full amountsfor which the Minister of Defence asks) the load of defence on our balance ofpayments would be in the region of  700 million in 1953. This would be roughlythe equivalent of 70 per cent, of the total imports by the Ministry of Food or about 25 per cent, of our total visible exports.4. Even on these reduced figures we will be taking serious risks with bur1economic policy objective of paying our way in the world.
