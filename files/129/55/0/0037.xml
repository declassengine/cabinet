(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF4IER BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 33 7 COPY NO. to 714TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTURKISH ARMAMENTS CREDITSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as my colleagues are aware, the Turkish Prime Minister and Ministerfor Foreign Affairs are paying an official visit to London this week.   I am confident that this visit will prove a success, but there is one long-standing pointof friction between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Turkish Governmentwhich disturbs me, namely the dispute over the repayment of the armamentscredits which Her Majesty&apos;s Government made available to the Turkish Governmentin 1938 and 1939.   I am very anxious to dispose of this question without delaybecause I fear that, if it is left unsettled, it will become a lasting source ofirritation and will impair the collaboration between the two Governments on issues of major international importance,background. The total sums received by the Turks under the armaments credits in1938 and 1939 amounted to approximately  39,300,000.   Until they defaulted inJuly, 1951, they had repaid  8,900,000 of the capital and had paid interestamounting to  7,700,000.   According to the terms under which the credits werenegotiated, all payments are made in Turkish liras, which are used to financeTurkish exports to the United Kingdom.   Since the Turkish default there havebeen various attempts to negotiate a settlement, but it has been impossible toreach agreement.   The present position is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have said that they will accept nothing less than  16 millions, while the Turks have offered only  2^ millions.   This offer, although disappointing, is at least aconsiderable advance on the  100,000 token payment which the Turks originallyoffered.   H. M. Ambassador at Ankara considers that, if matters are not clinchedin London this week, the prospect of a settlement in the foreseeable future will bedim.   He has proposed that in accepting payment over a period of years in freelyutilizable Turkish liras Her Majesty&apos;s Government should request the TurkishGovernment to agree to the use of a whole or part of the annuities, not on purchases of Turkish produce, but for British official expenditure in Turkey.   This isrunning at a little over 5 million Turkish liras annually (7. 84 T0 liras - i.l)eCONSIDERATIONS3. The political and strategic arguments for compounding with the Turksare strong.   The Turks themselves argue with some force that the original creditswere extended for political and strategic reasons in the interests of common defence that they have already paid more than  16 millions and that account should betaken of the very heavy military expenditure which they are now incurring for thecommon cause.   They are sure to press these arguments very strongly.   in considering them I am bound to take account of the fact that in all first-classinternational issues they have shown themselves sound and staunch allies.
They have become an important element in the North Atlantic treaty organisation and we need more than ever their support in the Middle East.It would be tragic if co-operation on these important issues were poisonedindefinitely by the question of the debt.4. The Turkish Ministers will also no doubt represent to me the serious deterioration in the Turkish economic position.   Turkey is in heavy deficit($216 millions) with the European Payhients Union arid t Understand that theBritish share of this amounts to about  20 millions,   Turkey is also very heavilyin deficit with the United Kingdom:  in the period January-August, 1952,Turkish exports to the United Kingdom totalled  4, 9 millions and her importsfrom the United Kingdom  25,4 millions.   As it is unlikely that we can do muchto increase our imports from Turkey, I shall be under even heavier pressure to let the Turks off lightly over the armaments debt.RECOMMENDATION5. In these circumstances I ask my colleagues to authorise me to make an effort to reach a settlement with the Turkish Ministers during their present visit.I see no possible hope of inducing the Turks to pay  16 millions or even  10millions,   I would propose to aim for  5 millions and to make the utmost effort to get it.   But in the last resort I should like authority to close for  3 millions.6. I realise that financially this will be a disappointing result.   But, asI see it, the only alternative to compounding for a low figure would be to abandonall hope of any repayment in the foreseeable future, as well as to accept thecontinued existence of an irritant in Anglo-Turkish relations at a time when it is imperative for relations to be maintained and improved.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.,14TH OCTOBER, 1952.
