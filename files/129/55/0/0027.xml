Printed for the. Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIAL copy no.74C. (52) 3279th October, 1952CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will know that for some time past discussions have been pro-ceeding about the rules governing the political activities of civil servants. I now submit proposals for amending those rules. But I must first explain what has happened in recent years.Pre-war Position2. Up to 1950 the position was as follows, and had been so for over twenty years:  Non-industrial Civil Servants(i) Under an Order in Council of 1927, non-industrial civil servants wereforbidden to stand for Parliament unless they first resigned;(ii) There was a Treasury rule of long standing that civil servants were&quot; expected to maintain at all times a reserve in political matters and not to put themselves forward prominently on one side or the other.&quot;It was left to Departments to decide what activities came within this general ban. The Post Office, alone of the Departments, had rules whichdefined the sort of activity which was banned or permitted.(iii) As regards local government it was left to the Head of each Depart-ment to determine if, and on what conditions, &quot; an officer of his Departmentmay become a candidate for, or serve on any local Council, provided that theduties involved .... shall not conflict with the officers performance of theduties of his Department.&quot;Industrial Civil servants in certain Departments, in particular the Service Departments, industrial civil servants were subject to no restrictions whatever and were even allowedto stand for Parliament; but other industrial civil servants, while not free to stand for Parliament unless they resigned, were subject to no other restrictions.Masterman Committee .     -3. After World War II the Staff Side of the Civil Service National whitley council pressed strongly for a review of the restrictions on the political activitiesof civil servants. In April 1948 the late Government appointed a strong Com-mittee under the chairmanship of Mr. J. C. Masterman, the Provost of WorcesterCollege, Oxford.4. In evidence before this Committee the Staff Side suggested that all therules limiting the political activities on the part of civil servants should be abolished and that reliance should be placed solely on the discretion of individuals. TheMasterman Committee in their Report-rejected this suggestion. Broadly speakingthey recommended that the Civil Service should continue to be divided into two-groups consisting on the.one hand of grades of which the members should be completely free to exercise whatever political activities they like, and on the other
hand, grades which should maintain a reserve in political matters and abstain from any public manifestation of views which might associate them with any political party.5.   The Committee did, however, recommend two very important changes.In the first place they proposed a substantial widening of the area of the CivilService which should enjoy complete freedom. That area should, they said, includenot only all the industrialists (over half of whom were already free) but also allthe manipulative grades in the Post Office (numbering some 200,000) and also anumber of minor grades such as messengers, &amp;c. This was a proposal to give com-plete freedom to some 650,000 civil servants, of whom some 400,000 are industrial and some 250,000 non-industrial.6. In the second place the Masterman Committee recommended that thereshould be more definition of the type of action which was to be regarded as coveredby the ban on political activities. The ban should be defined as covering not onlyparliamentary candidature but also the holding of office in a party political organisation; speaking in public on matters of party political controversy; writingletters to the press setting out views on party political matters; or engaging incanvassing, &amp;c, of political candidatures. On Local Government, however, theCommittee recommended that permission to take part should be granted to themaximum extent possible consistent with maintenance of the Civil Serviced repu-tation for political impartiality.Events following the publication of the Masterman Report7. In June 1949, the Government published the Committee&apos;s Report(Cmd. 7718) and at the same time announced that it accepted its recommendations.This provoked strong protest from the Staff Side on two grounds. The first wasthat the Government had not discussed the terms of the Report with them before coming to a decision on it. This was a deliberate act on the part of the late government, who took the view that the extent to which civil servants might take part in political activities was a matter of high State policy and inappropriate for negotiation on the National Whitley Council in the manner usual with matters of domestic concern to the Civil Service.8. The second reason for the Staff Side&apos;s dislike of the Report was that besidesrecommending the maintenance of rules limiting the freedom of civil servants, it insome ways, by defining them more closely, increased the existing restrictions.9. There followed a period of agitation in Parliament and in November 1949the Government decided:(i) that effect should be given to the recommendations of the MastermanReport in so far as they freed all industrials and minor and manipulativegrades from restrictions on their political activities;(ii) that, before a final decision was taken on the rules appropriate to the restof the Service, there should be discussions through the machinery ofthe National Whitley Council to see whether, without departing fromthe general principles of the Masterman Report, some modification ofthe proposals, acceptable to both sides of the Council, might be found for submission for the consideration of Ministers;(iii) that meanwhile for the grades concerned in (ii) the practice which hadprevailed before the Report was published should be maintained.The Report of the Whitley Committee10. In accordance with 9 (ii) a Committee of the National Whitley council was set up under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Bridges, including on the official side the Permanent Secretaries of some of the largest Departments.After months of very difficult discussion the Committee has succeeded in producing what amounts to an agreed scheme ad referendum to Ministers, subjectto reservations on two relatively minor points. It is this scheme, set out in the annexed Report, which I submit for the consideration of my colleagues.11. The essence of the scheme is as follows. It recommends the retention ofthe conception underlying the Masterman Report that there should be in the CivilService(a) on the one hand certain grades which should have complete politicalfreedom;
(b) other grades which must abstain from any public manifestation of views which might associate them with a political party.Moreover, it accepts in general the recommendations of the Masterman Committeefor definition of the restrictions to be maintained in force.12. The new conception introduced by the Whitley Committee is the creationof a third group of civil servants intermediate between these two categories andcalled, for want of a better name, &quot; the grey class.&quot; The members of this classwould be neither completely and automatically free like, say, postmen, nor subjectto the same restrictions as, say, administrative officers; instead, they would be eligible for partial, but quite considerable freedom, permission to exercise this free-dom being granted or withheld by Departments mainly according to the degree to which the individual civil servants work brought him into contact with the public.13. Permission to engage in political activities would be given to individuals in this intermediate class on the understanding that they would be subject tocertain limitations on the extent to which they might express views on government policy and national political activities. Subject to this limitation the permissionwould extend to all activities allowed to the completely free except that actualParliamentary candidature would still be barred on the ground that Parliamentarycandidates could not be subjected to restraint on their expression of political views.14. The intermediate group would consist chiefly of typists, clerical assistants,clerical officers and parallel grades, amounting in all to nearly 300,000 staff. TheCommittee estimated that only one-third of those included in this group would, inpractice, be likely to be denied the full freedom open to the group, should they seekit. And even they would be allowed to take part in local Government activities tothe extent to which the circumstances of their Department permitted, subject again to the observation of a certain discretion in their public utterances.Matters for Decision15. The main point for decision by the Cabinet is whether to accept thisscheme. In considering this issue they will want to be sure that the scheme doesnothing which might undermine the tradition of a non-political, non-partisan publicservice. To-day the Civil Service is a very large and diversified organisation. Itreaches into every town and touches the lives of the people at many points.Although many of the staffs engaged in these local offices are employed uponduties of a fairly routine nature, it is nevertheless as essential to safeguard public confidence in the political impartiality of civil servants who come into contact withthe public in local offices, as it is to ensure the continued confidence in the impartial-tiality of higher civil servants who advise Ministers in Headquarters Offices,16. At the same time it is fair to point out that there are very large numbersof civil servants in the clerical and analogous grades whose duties involve a verysmall element of discretion, if any, and that it is contrary to the traditions of thiscountry to impose restrictions on the political activities of citizens unless thoserestrictions are clearly necessary in the public interest.17. The extent to which officers in the clerical and analogous grades of theCivil Service can be allowed political freedom without bringing into jeopardy the reputation of the Service for political impartiality depends, therefore, on the extentto which they come into contact with the public as responsible agents of the centralgovernment, and it is for this reason that any scheme which is to extend still further the additional freedom contemplated in the Masterman Report must be drawn upin such a way as to have regard to the circumstances of particular Departments.18. After full consideration I have come to the conclusion that the report ofthe National Whitley Council provides a sound solution of a difficult question andthat it can be accepted without any damage to the interest of the State or the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality. I recommend mycolleagues to adopt it.19. If my colleagues accept this view, decisions are called for on two sub-sidiary matters. As stated in paragraph 10 above, the Report of the JointCommittee is an agreed one with the exception of two reservations to which the
Staff Side attach much importance, but which the Official Side did not feel able torecommend to Ministers to accept.   These were:  (i) that the Junior Executive Officer grade and analogous grades be includedin the intermediate category; -(ii) that canvassing should be excluded from the political activities debarredto the higher grades and allowable to members of the intermediateclass only by permission of the Department. Thus the Staff Sideproposed that all civil servants shoufd be free to canvass in supportof candidates for Parliament or local government should they so wish,subject only to their personal judgment of the fitness of so doing.20. I gave the Staff Side an opportunity to come and see me and elaboratetheir views on these reservations. But having considered what they said I am not disposed to agree with them on either point. I agree with the objections to thesetwo Staff Side proposals as they are expressed in paragraph 4 of Annex 4 and paragraph 5 of Annex 3 to the Whitley Report (see pages 19, 20, 16 and 17 below).SummaryI recommend to the Cabinet (i) That we should accept the scheme embodied in the report from the CivilService National Whitley Council and summarised in paragraphs 11to 14 above.(ii) That we should reject the proposals made by the Staff Side about (a) the inclusion of the junior executive grades and analogous grades in the intermediate category, and(b) canvassing.(iii) That in view of the importance of the issue involved the Government^decision should be announced in a White Paper, to be laid beforeParliament.  No legislation will be needed to give effect to the decision.(iv) That the Opposition should be informed of the position privately beforethe White Paper is laid though as the scheme is in the main agreed with Staff representatives I do not expect the Opposition to raise objection.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th October, 1952.
CIVIL SERVICE NATIONAL WHITLEY council report of a Joint Committee set up to Consider Certain Aspects of theGeneral Question of the Political Activities of Civil ServantsTerms of reference . On 15th November, 1949, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasurystated in the House of Commons the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that before final decisions were reached on the extent to which, within the general principlesof the Report of the Masterman Committee on the Political Activities of civilservants (Command 7718) civil servants could be free to take part in political activities, it would be appropriate that there should be joint discussions throughthe machinery of the National Whitley Council. We were appointed a Committeeto be the medium of those discussions. It has been our task to explore the possi-bility of producing, for the consideration of the Government, proposals acceptable to both Sides of the Council for the modification of the recommendations of theMasterman Report.2. All our discussions have been &quot; within the general principles of the Master-man Report.&quot; That is, we have started from the propositions that all non-industrial civil servants cannot be free to take overt part in national political activities; thatthe non-industrial Civil Service has therefore to be divided between those who are so free and those who are not; that the dividing line is one to be settled by rule andnot at the discretion of the individual. The Staff Side do not admit the validity ofthese propositions, but they have accepted them for the purpose of these discussions.Our primary object has been to consider whether the complete freedom fromrestrictions proposed by the Masterman Committee for cetrain categories of civil servant (and put into effect in January 1950) might be extended to other categories.The Masterman recommendations. The Masterman Committee recommended that complete freedom to take part in political activities and in local government activities should be accorded tothe industrial grades not already enjoying it and to the minor and manipulativegrades. The application of this recommendation released about 450,000 from all restrictions, and now some 650,000 civil servants are completely free, even to theextent of being allowed, while still civil servants, to be adopted as candidates for parliamentary elections. (They must resign before Nomination Day, but if notelected are reinstated.)For the rest of the, Civil Service some 400,000 people the committee recommended that they should maintain a reserve in political matters and abstain from any public manifestation of views which might associate them prominentlywith a political party. In particular, they were not to hold any office, such as president, chairman, secretary, in any party political organisation; speak in publicon matters of party political controversy; write letters to the press setting forththeir views on party political matters; or engage in canvassing in support of politicalcandidatures. So far as local government activities were concerned, however,permission to take part should be granted to the maximum extent possible con-sistently with the maintenance of the Civil Serviced reputation for politicalimpartiality.Thus, the Masterman plan would divide the non-industrial Civil Service intothe Completely Free and the Restricted. The dividing line is pretty clearly defined,with two large groups on the one side of it, and all the rest on the other.The Staff Side&apos;s proposals. The Staff Side, accepting for the purpose of these discussions that theremust be such a line, proposed that the area of complete freedom should be extendedto include not only industrial staff and minor and manipulative.non-mdustrial staff,as at present, but also certainly:  (a)-(i) all typists and other sub-clerical staff;(ii) all clerical staff and parallel staffs;(iii) all junior executive officers (and parallel staffs);
and possibly-(b) some higher grades.This then was the proposal which we had before us at the beginning of our discussions.5. The Official Side were quite unable to accept this proposition, even so faras the staff in (a) (i) and (ii) were concerned. This was primarily because of theirconviction that, whatever might be the position in some Departments and sometypes of office, very serious harm would be done to the Civil Serviced reputation forimpartiality if clerical or sub-clerical staff in the local offices of Departments suchas the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of National Insurance, National assistance board, and Inland Revenue, were free to identify themselves with party politics-and to do so unreservedly and right up to the extreme stage of parliamentary candidature. The staff in such local offices are in direct personal contact with individual members of the public and take, or seem to the public to have discretion to take, decisions affecting their personal well-being. To the Official Side it wasunthinkable that such staff could within the principles of the Masterman Report begiven complete political freedom. They may be remote from policy-making andmany of them may have little, if any, actual discretion in individual cases. But tomany members of the community, they nevertheless represent &quot; the Civil Service,&quot;being the point at which the governmental machine most obviously touches their personal lives. In this respect the local office staff of these Departments are in avery different position from the Post Office counter clerk, for whom the MastermanCommittee recommended complete freedom.6. The Staff Side argued that the Official SideY apprehensions sprang froman altogether distorted view of the situation; that by under-estimating the sense ofresponsibility and discretion of the staffs concerned as greatly as they over-estimated the importance which these staffs were in the eyes of the public, they had conjuredup dangers which did not exist; that these dangers, if they had existed, wouldhave been revealed already since there was reason to believe that quite a numberof the staffs under discussion, including some above the clerical level, had been engaged in political activities, with discretion and without embarrassment to their departments, for years past and particularly during the two General Electionssince the Masterman Report was issued; that it was not to be believed that such activities on the part of typists, clerical assistants or even clerical officers would lead any reasonable members of the public to doubt their integrity in the per-formance of their official duties; that the Official Side&apos;s undiscriminating taboowas its own condemnation, and that within whatever line of division might beagreed for application generally in the Service the same confidence should be shownin the staffs of these local offices as in the staffs of other offices until experienceproved it to be misplaced.7. Considerable discussion failed, however, to shake the Official Side fromtheir view. They did not deny that there are in the area of restriction some, indeedmany, individuals employed on work which is such that they could in practice begiven political freedom without endangering the primary principle of the necessityfor having a line at all. But if a line is to be drawn, it must be both broadlyintelligible and administratively workable. And that being so, it seemed impossibleto the Official Side to put the line between the Completely Free and the Restrictedin any significantly different place from that in which the Masterman Committeeput it.Disagreement on the Staff Side&apos;s proposals. The Committee were therefore unable to agree on a plan for the simpleredrawing of the Masterman line. But from our very considerable discussions on this point there emerged the idea of the scheme which it is the main purposeof this Report to present.Alternative Proposal9. Even if the Masterman line had to remain where it was, leaving untouchedthe area of complete freedom, was it possible, consistently with the general principlesof the Masterman Report, and without producing acute administrative difficulties,to draw another line through those to whom the Report denied complete freedom
in national political activities, dividing these in their turn into the &quot; Restricted&apos;1and the &quot; Less Restricted &quot;? In other words, could the Service be divided not into two categories as envisaged in the Masterman Report, but into three as follows: -(a) classes completely free (on the Masterman plan);(b) classes subject to restrictions;(c) a category intermediate between (a) and (b), of classes whose members might be partially free by permission; this category being a newconception.10. We think it can. Both Official and Staff Sides are agreed that acategory (c) could be created, and for want of a better name we shall, for con-venience, refer to it as the grey class. The main features of this class would beas follows:  The Grey Class11. Civil Servants of the grey class would be eligible for permission to engage in all national political activities except Parliamentary candidature.12. The granting of permission would depend on the acceptance of a code of discretion, putting certain limitations on the extent to which, and the mannerin which, the civil servant could express views on Governmental policy and nationalpolitical issues generally. (Hence, the exclusion of Parliamentary candidature frompermissible activity: it would be impracticable to demand discretion of this sortfrom a would-be Member of Parliament.) A draft code of discretion is attached as Annex I.13. In deciding which of their7grey class staff should be allowed this degreeof freedom Departments would be influenced mainly by the criterion of remotenessof contact with the public and anonymity.14. The grades to be included in the grey class would be settled centrally.This having been done, each Department would divide its grey class staff asfollows:  (a) those to be covered by what might be called an open general licence totake part in all the national political activities open to the grey class,this open general licence being given to cover whole blocks of staff, sofar as possible;(b) those who must individually seek permission, which would be granted onthe merits of the individual case according to the criterion indicated inparagraph 12 above.The detailed arrangements would be discussed with the departmental staff representatives, but within the machinery centrally laid down the decision would rest with the Department.15. Subject to certain special rules for those Departments (the Ministries of housing and Local Government, Education, Health and Transport) in close officialcontact with local authorities, grey class staff with an open general licence for national political activities would be&quot; allowed to take part in local government andin political activities in the local field (that is, political activities in relation to localgovernment) subject to:  (a) the observance of the code of discretion referred to in paragraph 12 above;(b) the notification to their Department of election to a local authority.Grey class staff not covered by open general licence could seek permission to take part in local government activities and in political activities in the localfield. Generally speaking, those to whom permission would be given to take partin national political activities would be given permission to take part in local govern-ment, &amp;c, activities subject to the code of discretion referred to in paragraph 12above. Those not allowed to take part in national political activities would never-theless, in as many cases as possible, be given permission to take part in localgovernment and in political activities in the local field. This permission, whichwould be subject to a code of discretion requiring them to act with moderation,particularly in matters affecting their own Department see Annex 2 would cover freedom to hold local party political office, such as Ward Secretary, impingingonly or primarily on local government activity, but not any office impinging onlyor primarily on party politics in the national field.
16. Staff who were neither in the grey class nor in the area of complete free-dom would not be allowed to take overt part in national political activities. But(subject to what is said in paragraph 15 about the special position of certainDepartments) they would be eligible to seek permission to take part in localgovernment activities and in political activities in the local field. This permissionwould be given to the maximum extent which the circumstances permitted, subjectto the observance of the code of discretion (Annex 2).17. Apart from a difference of opinion on the Staff Side&apos;s proposition thatcanvassing, in a Parliamentary or a local election, is not such a public manifestationof party political views that it need be forbidden to anyone (a matter which is dealtwith in Annex 3), the two Sides are in agreement on this conception of the greyclass.18. The question then is, what grades should be included in this class? Thetwo Sides are agreed that it should include the following:  (a) typists, clerical assistants, clerical officers and their analogues general service and departmental;(b) grades parallel to those in (a) i.e., grades of roughly the same status,whether general Service or departmental, e.g., Assistants (scientific);(c) departmental grades known as the intermediate clerical grades (a very small group);(d) grades parallel to the general Service grade of junior executive officer,i.e., grades which, not being in an executive class, either general service or departmental, or in a class analogous thereto (e.g., the informationofficer class) are of roughly the same status, e.g., draughtsmen, leadingdraughtsmen, assistant experimental officer, experimental officer, tech-nical grades 2 and 3;(e) Post Office manipulative supervising officers who, not being within the areaof freedom as recommended in the Masterman Report, have salaryscales whose maximum is not higher than, or not much higher than themaximum of the junior executive officer scale.19. So constituted, the grey class would include about 290,000 staff. Of theseit is estimated that some 185,000 would be given an open general licence (see para-graph 14). Of the 100,000 or so who would have individually to seek permission to take part in national political activities, probably about 45,000 would get it. Thegreat majority of those who would not get it would be in local offices of theMinistry of Labour and National Service, the Ministry of National Insurance, the inland Revenue, and the National Assistance Board. Those not allowed to take part in national political activities would be given permission to take part in localgovernment activities to the maximum extent which the circumstances of the par-ticular case permitted.20. There are roughly a million civil servants, industrial and non-industrial,established and unestablished. If the arrangements envisaged were put into force,the general position would be that about 62 per cent, of them would be completelyfree; another 22 per cent., say, would, subject to the code of discretion, be free totake part in all political activities except Parliamentary candidature, and some16 per cent, would not be free to take part in national political activities but wouldbe given permission, in as many cases as possible, to take part in local governmentand political activities in the local field.21. In addition, we are agreed that the existing Post Office rule permittingcanvassing by Post Office staff, except where &quot; obviously incompatible with their official position,&quot; should be maintained.22. We are also agreed that a few individuals who now hold certain types oflocal party political office which would not be allowed to other members of theirgrades should continue to be free to hold them.23. In recommending for the consideration of Ministers the institution of agrey class, and in effect the extension of a very real measure of freedom to over200,000 civil servants whom the Masterman Committee put outside the area of freedom altogether, we have, we think, achieved a not inconsiderable measure ofagreement. It has been reached only after much thought on both sides and a greatdeal of joint discussion, and would have been impossible without a real effort on each side to understand the other&apos;s point of view and to meet it so far as funda-mental conviction would permit.
24. But there nevertheless remain two major aspects of the problem on which,having been unable to reach agreement, we can only record the respective points of view of the two Sides.   These unresolved questions are:  (i) Should canvassing be excluded from the political activities for which per-mission is necessary, i.e., should all civil servants be free to canvass insupport of candidates for Parliament or local government, should they so wish, subject only to their personal judgment as to the fitness of so doing?(2) Should the junior executive officer grade and analogous grades be includedin the grey class?25. In spite of much discussion we have been unable to reach an agreedconclusion on these two questions: to both of them the Staff Side would say &quot; yes &quot;and the Official Side &quot; no.&quot; This Report can therefore do no more than record forthe consideration of Ministers the respective views of each side on each matter.Annex 3 sets out the opposing points of view on canvassing. Annex 4 sets out the opposing points of view on the inclusion in the grey class of the junior executivegrade, &amp;c.Conclusion26. As we said in paragraph 1, our task has been to explore the possibilityof producing for the consideration of the Government proposals acceptable to bothSides of the Council for the modification of the recommendations of the MastermanCommittee.We have succeeded in this task by producing the scheme for a class of civil servant, intermediate between the two envisaged by the Masterman Committee,that is, between those who as a class have complete freedom, and those who, as a class are forbidden to engage in any activities associating them publicly with apolitical party. This new class, which we have called the grey class, and which wehave described in detail in paragraphs 10 to 16, would be eligible for partial but still considerable freedom.   We submit this proposal for consideration27. If it is accepted, as we hope it will be, decisions will be called for on thetwo subsidiary but nevertheless important-matters dealt with in detail in annexes 3 and 4:  (a) Should officers who would not be allowed to engage in national or local political activities generally (whether they are within the grey class or outside it) be forbidden to engage in canvassing, on the grounds thatit involves prominent public manifestation of party political views anda real risk that for them to engage in it would give rise to public concern? .(b) Is the grey class to include the junior executive officer and analogousgrades?Signed on behalf of the Staff Side:     Signed on behalf of the Official Side:A. J. T. DAY. EDWARD BRIDGES.April, 1952.ANNEX 1Codes of DiscretionCode of Discretion for those who, though not completely free politically, are allowed to take part in both national political activities and local governmentand political activities in the local fieldA certain discretion is required of those civil servants who, not being withinthe area of complete political freedom, are nevertheless given permission to take part in national political activities (other than Parliamentary candidature) and in local government and local political activities. All such staff should bear in mind that they are servants of the public, working under the direction of Her Majesty&apos;ministers forming the Government of the day.   While they are not debarred from
advocating or criticising the policy of any political party, comment should be expressed with moderation (particularly in relation to matters for which their ownMinister is responsible) and should avoid personal attacks. They should use everycare to avoid the embarrassment to Ministers or to their Department which could result, whether by inadvertence or not, from the actions of a person known to bea civil servant who brings himself prominently to public notice in party political controversy.ANNEX 2Code of Discretion for those who though not allowed to take part in nationalpolitical activities are allowed to participate in local government and political activities in the local field the permission to participate in local government and in political activities inthe local field granted to civil servants not free to participate in national political activities is subject to the condition that they act with moderation and discretion,particularly in matters affecting their own Department and that they take care notto involve themselves in matters of political controversy which are of nationalrather than local significance.ANNEX 3Canvassing1. The two Sides are agreed that the political activities for which permissionshould be necessary are the holding of office in party political organisations, speakingin public on matters of party political controversy and expressing views on suchmatters in letters to the Press, books, articles or leaflets.2. The Official Side would add canvassing, on the grounds that, like these other activities, it is a prominent public manifestation of party political views andthat knowledge that a civil servant was engaging in it could spread widely enoughto give rise to public concern.3. The Staff Side strongly contest the Official Side&apos;s attitude and for several reasons. Their main argument is that canvassing does not satisfy the two conditionsin the previous paragraph which, not separately but only when combined, can beheld by the Official Side to justify the denial of freedom to a large number of civilservants. The task of the canvasser nowadays is not to persuade people to vote in any particular way but to find out how they intend to vote. His specific instruc-tions, in one party at any rate, are to that effect. His object being research, notpropaganda, he need not engage in argument or express his own political views,although it is true that by canvassing for a particular party he does identify himself with it. But not prominently, nor, in any reasonable meaning of the word, publicly,since canvassing is, in its nature, a series of private interrogations of individualcitizens. Canvassing cannot, therefore, be said to involve a &quot; prominent publicmanifestation of party political views.&quot; Nor, in general turning to the secondcondition need it expose the civil servant to the risk of being widely identified as such. Even if he canvassed voters in the immediate neighbourhood of his own home, those who knew him by conversation, common talk, &amp;c, to be a civil servantmight in the same way, and without any sort of public manifestation on his part,already know him to be a supporter of this party of that and his appearance as acanvasser on its behalf would be no new revelation. But in practice it would generally be easy to arrange for civil servants to canvass in parts of the constituency,away from the immediate neighbourhood of their own homes, where, unless forsome reason not connected with politics they were already public figures, they wouldbe fleeting eallers at every door, unidentified either by name or by occupation. this being so, the Staff Side cannot see what real danger to the reputation of the service for the politically impartial discharge of its duties-the Official Side&apos;s sole or mainjustification for imposingany restriction can be apprehended to warrant the formalwithdrawal of this particular right of the ordinary citizen from any civil servant,though they would expect that in exceptional cases (e.g., where a civil servant inone of the higher grades was already, for some reason, generally known as. suchthroughout the constituency) the right would not be exercised.
4. Their view is supported by actual experience. Staff rules in the Post office have for many years specifically permitted canvassing, without restriction as togrades, but with the proviso that the Postmaster-General might have to impose Unemployment\&amp; the use of the open licence ever proved embarrassing. As it has never done so,.xiMit is to be inferred that no untoward consequences or none worth mentioning-have resulted from the general permission to canvass. Nor have any such conse-quences followed from the canvassing in which civil servants, not only of the lowestgrades, in other departments have considered themselves free to engage in view ofthe specific permission given in the Post Office rules and the absence of any specificprohibition in their own. Now to designate canvassing as the sort of political activity which should be denied to those not allowed to engage in political activitiesgenerally would, therefore, be to impose a new restriction for which there is nodemonstrable justification from the Official Side&apos;s own point of view as the staff side understand it.5.   The Official Side find it extremely difficult to accept these arguments.It may be that the modern canvasser is usually instructed not to seek to persuade or to indulge in argument. This is not, of course, a matter on which theOfficial Side are well qualified to express a view. Nevertheless, a canvassercanvasses on behalf of a particular candidate and on behalf of a party: he may even wear a badge on his lapel showing which party he is not only supporting but is working for. To the Official Side this seems undeniably to be putting oneselfforward prominently in association with a political party. It also seems to themundeniably to be putting oneself forward publicly in association with a political party. The &quot; publicity &quot;. may be different from that involved in, say, addressinga meeting but it is nevertheless there, and in the Official Side&apos;s view no less incon-sistent with the general principles within which the Committee is working. More-over, and more importantly, the Official Side think that this is how the matter wouldstrike the public.As to the present rules, it is true that, outside the Post Office, departmentalrules make no mention of canvassing. But they are couched in very general terms.For example, in several Departments the rule says: &quot; Civil servants are expectedto maintain at all times a reserve in political matters and not put themselves forwardprominently on one side or the other.&quot; In another Department the rule says:&quot; It is a well understood rule that civil servants should refrain from taking an overtpart in public political affairs.&quot; In another Department the rule says that &quot;civilservants should refrain from taking an active share in party politics.&quot; To theOfficial Side it is inconceivable that the general run of the staff could seriously havebelieved that to canvass was compatible with rules worded in this way. The factthat the Post Office&apos;s rule was different would, in the Official Side&apos;s view, prove verylittle: the Post Office is far from being.a typical Department.As to past practice, the Official Side are not aware that staff generally have infact canvassed either to a small or large extent. Had permission to do so beenasked, it would certainly have been refused. But even if some civil servants, who in future may not be free to do so, have in the past canvassed, and canvassed with-out doing noticeable harm to the Civil Serviced reputation for impartiality, that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that openly to declare that all civilservants are free to canvass would do no harm. And to omit canvassing from the list of political activities for which permission must be given, which must inevitably be published, would be tantamount to such a declaration.ANNEX 4The Scope of the Grey Class1. The Staff Side propose that the grey class should include the juniorexecutive officer grade and the analogous grades. There are some 40,000 people in these grades.2. For this proposal the Staff Side advance the following reasons. Thearguments for complete restriction apply in their full force to the extreme case ofthe administrative class and, in the view of those who believe in them, diminish ineffect as they are extended downwards. Conversely, the arguments for complete freedom, to be used with individual discretion, are weightiest at the bottom levelof industrial, minor and manipulative and analogous grades and may be held to
lose some of their force as they are extended upwards. Where can the two sets of arguments reasonably be said to meet and balance? Not, in the Staff Side&quot;view as low down, in a graded Service ranging in terms from, say  4 a week to 5,000 a year, as a grade which at its maximum receives only  700 a year. At that level the arguments for allowing ordinary citizen rights unless their denial isdemonstrably necessary to the preservation of public confidence in the Servicehave by no means lost their force or been outweighed by the converse arguments for withholding these rights in case an incident should occur to bring into question the impartiality of an individual civil servant as such. To allow freedom in anycontext is to take a risk, and while the Staff Side, though not sharing it, can under-stand the Official Side&apos;s reluctance to take any risk at all by granting politicalfreedom to, say, Assistant Secretaries rising to  2,000 a year, they feel bound tosay that to view junior executive officers and their like in the same light, to considerthe reputation of the Service to be as vulnerable through them as through the much higher grade, to want the same absolute assurance against risk in the one case asin the other, and to deny freedom to all members of the junior executive grades,however and wherever employed, equally with all members of the higher grades of the administrative class, is to carry an arguable caution to the verge of timidity.3. The Staff Side can well believe that as about a quarter of the grey class, ifconstituted as in paragraph 18 of the Report, would be entirely restricted, theproportion of junior executive officers who would be similarly restricted if includedin that class would be higher still. Those allowed to engage in political activitiesmight indeed be only the minority. But it is a serious matter, tending to be over-looked when dealing with civil servants in the mass, to deprive a single individualof any of that freedom of speech and lawful action in political matters for whichrevolutions have been started, and the Staff Side take the view that if, as they believe to be the case, an appreciable number of junior executive officers could,with discretion, and without any real risk to the repute of the Service, engage in political activities, they ought not to be deprived of the opportunity of doing soon a theory that this is the level of the Service where the arguments against the grades as a whole override the arguments in favour of certain of the individuals in them. The Staff Side would not even agree that this could be said at the higherexecutive level. But as, for the purpose of achieving an agreed settlement, the gap between the two Sides has been narrowed to the junior executive case, the staff side do not press their point of view beyond that, but confine themselves to it inthe belief that, up to that level at any rate, the balance of argument is clearly intheir favour.4. The Official Side are unable to accept the Staff Side&apos;s proposal to includejunior executive officers, &amp;c, in the grey class because, in their view, it is at this level that one enters the lower reaches of that part of the Civil Service of whosepolitical impartiality it is essential that there should be no doubt in the public mind.Members of the higher grades of the general Service executive class not infrequentlywork in close association with the administrative class in framing policy. Manyof its members in all grades are engaged in the day-to-day working out and ampli-fication of the detail of that policy. Others are in responsible positions in local offices. Mutatis mutandis, the same is true of the analogous classes in Departmentssuch as the Ministry of Labour, Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. TheOfficial Side appreciate that the Staff Side propose the inclusion in the grey classonly of the basic grades of the executive classes, and obviously the responsibilities of these junior grades should not be over-estimated: there are junior executive officers employed on work for example, in the Post Office Savings department and in the museums far removed from policy-making and remote from contact with the public. They realise, too; that the Staff Side for their part appreciate that,fuven the conception of the grey class, the freedom permitted within it would have  be denied to very many junior executive officers and their analogous colleagues,were they included in it. But nevertheless the Official Side are unable to persuadethemselves that it would be right to recommend the inclusion of these grades in thearea&apos; of possible freedom. They see that it is possible reasonably to draw a lineabove the clerical officer or thereabouts. But above that line, the atmosphere and responsibilities are, generally speaking, radically different from what they are belowit. It was only after much hesitation that the Official Side agreed to recommend the inclusion in the grey class of the technical grades parallel with the juniorexecutive officer, and therefore of higher status than clerical officer. In so recom-mending they have gone to what they regard as the&apos;farthest limit consistent withthe general principles of the Masterman Report.
