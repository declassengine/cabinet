DRAFT OF THE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE prorogation of parliament my Lords and Members of the House of Commons ! r;&apos;1. My thoughts turn first toMy beloved Father whose death was so ,d;eeplymourned throughout the Commonwealth and beyond. The countless expressions of devotion to Him have moved Me deeply and encourage Me in My resolutedetermination to prove Worthy of &quot;a sacred trust.2. My Ministers have continued to give the fullest support to the united nations Organisation in its efforts to promote international co-operation and tomaintain peace.3. My forces are playing their full part in collective resistance to aggression in Korea and have, enhanced their, high reputation for efficiency and for readiness to carry out whatever task is demanded of them by land, at sea or in the air. Imourn the loss of gallant lives which has brought sorrow to many homes. MyGovernments in the United Kingdom and in the other countries of the Common-wealth have worked ceaselessly to achieve an armistice agreement in conformitywith the principles for which the United Nations stand.4. In Malaya My forces and&apos;the civil administration are successfully carryingout a difficult task with patience and determination. In spite of great loss andsuffering all communities are playing an ever more active part in the defence oftheir freedom.5. My Government, in close association with our Allies, have shared in the steady development of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. They have welcomed the notable contribution which the people of the United States of Americahave made to the strengthening of the Organisation and of its member countries.I have watched with hope and confidence the measures which these countries, nowhappily joined by Turkey and Greece, have taken to secure themselves against the threat of armed aggression. The continued strengthening of My forces has con-tributed to the growing power of the free world to deter aggression and so to preserve peace.6. My Government have worked for the promotion of unity and prosperityin Europe and are now taking a leading part in the work of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation. They have also appointed a permanentdelegation to the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community.7. A treaty of mutual assistance has been concluded between the UnitedKingdom and the members of the European Defence Community and My Gdvern-ment have joined with the Governments of the United States of America andFrance in reaffirming their guarantee to Berlin. It is their confident hope thatthese and other related measures will contribute powerfully to the stability of western Europe and of the democratic world.8. My Ministers have supported the inclusion of the German Federal Republicin the European community and by ratifying the Bonn conventions have forged anew relationship between the United Kingdom and Germany. I regret, however,that prolonged exchanges between My Government and the Soviet Governmenthave not yet ended in agreement upon the unification of Germany in conditionsof freedom and that the efforts of My Government to conclude an Austrian StateTreaty have not yet been successful.9. The Japanese Peace Treaty has been ratified and legislation has been passed to give effect to certain of its provisions.10. My Government, with the help of other Commonwealth governments and of the Sterling Area as a whole, have taken drastic steps to stop the drain onour reserves and thereby to redress the balance of payments and to maintain thestrength of sterling as an international currency.
