Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1952Copy No. 67CABINETERITREA-BRITISH WITHDRAWALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will be aware that the British Administration in Eritreatransferred its powers to the local authorities at midnight on 15th-16th September,and withdrew from the country immediately thereafter accompanied by the small british garrison. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are thus relieved of the last of thethree former Italian Colonies in Africa: Somalia, Libya and Eritrea.2. In accordance with resolutions of the United Nations, Somalia was handedover to Italian Trusteeship on 1st April, 1950; Libya became independent on24th December, 1951; and Eritrea has now become federated with Ethiopia as alocally autonomous unit under the Ethiopian Crown.3. The Eritrean settlement prescribed in a United Nations resolution ofDecember 1950, was in some ways the most difficult to negotiate. The Ethiopianswanted to annex the territory while the Italians wanted it to become an independent state; and both we as administrators, and the United Nations Commissioner forEritrea, have had to hold a difficult middle course.4. The first task of the British Chief Administrator, after the adoption of theUnited Nations Resolution, was to put down the serious banditry which threatened to impede all progress. It was then possible for the United Nations commissioner to sound Eritrean opinion and to produce the Constitution of this new autonomousunit in the Ethiopian Empire. Meanwhile the British Administration conductedthe first general elections in the territory, leading to the establishment this spring of the Eritrean Representative Assembly, which approved the Constitution in july and appointed a temporary Executive Committee to take over from the british administration such urgent tasks as the engagement of staff and placing of con-tracts for the future Eritrean Government. The British Administration meanwhilecompleted their disposal of State assets between the future Federal and Eritreanauthorities in accordance with a United Nations Resolution of January 1952, whichagain struck a compromise between Italian and Ethiopian interests. Throughoutthese operations there was fortunately a minimum of friction between Christianand Moslem Eritreans, and the Government of the territory (under a ChristianChief Executive who is persona grata to the Emperor of Ethiopia), represents mostof the Eritrean parties, creeds and regional interests.5.   The seal was set on these arrangements by the Emperor&apos;s ratification of &apos;the Eritrean Constitution on 11th August, and his ratification on 11th Septemberof the Act of Federation which safeguards the limited autonomy of Eritrea in theterms of the United Nations Resolution of 1950.6.   It is our hope that we have left an Eritrea which will remain stable, and whose disposal the United Nations General Assembly will note with approval whenit considers the reports of the United Nations Commissioner and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment this autumn.43059CONFIDENTIALC.

Eritrea has not been able to exist as a stable and well-run country withoutfinancial assistance from-, Hp%:-t]$%jtttyX.QovpTWi$8&amp; \ which,, (on civil votes alone)has cost some  2,600,000 since *tne ^ occupation in 1941&apos; at&apos; an&apos; annual rate in recentyears of about  350,000.

They have undertaken to pay to Her Majesty&apos;s Government the isiah of 950,000 over the next year, and have indemnified us against any financial, clangs.8. The Department of the Foreign Office responsible for the administrativeaspects of the work, the Foreign Office Administration of African Territories, hasnow completed the task for which it was set up in 1949, and will wind up itsaffairs by the end of the year.A.
