(THE-DOCUMENT--IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENT)secret.(52) 306 COPY NO.24th SEPTEMBER, 1952.CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE UNION OF SOUTH africa in THE CONTEXT OF THE UNITED NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.At the forthcoming General Assembly of the United Nations theSouth African Government will almost certainly be severely attacked on three questions:  the question of the treatment of Indians in South Africa;  the generalracial policy of the Union Government, which has given rise to the currentpassive disobedience campaign;  and the problem of South West Africa.   the attack on the first two questions will probably be led by the Indian Delegation.It is necessary to decide the policy by which the United Kingdom delegation should be guided on these issues.   Brief notes on these three items are atAppendices I, II and III.2. Our policy on all these items should have regard to three basicfactors.   First, we must preserve our own rights as a Colonial Power vis-a-vis the United Nations:  we cannot afford to allow that organisation to establish a &quot;right&quot; to intervene in any way in our colonial administration.   In our view the political affairs of our dependent territories are essentially a matter withinthe domestic jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and as such fall outside thescope of the Assembly by virtue of Article 2(7&apos;)* of the Charter.   Secondly, wehave a reputation to maintain as a champion of liberal Western civilisation.We would wish to maintain this reputation not only in the United Nations but alsobefore our own public opinion and - what is perhaps even more important -opinion within our colonies.   African and Asian opinion in our colonies isespecially hostile to the Union of South Africa, and any move on our part whichcould be construed as endorsement of Union racial policy could bring us intoserious conflict with that opinion, especially in West and Central Africa.   Wemust also bear in mind the strength of opinion in India and Pakistan on this subject.* Article 2(7) of the Charter reads as follows:-   &quot;Nothing contained in thepresent Charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.. , &quot;
3. Thirdly, we must do all we can to preserve and strength ourrelations with South Africa.   This is important not only on the general ground of the desirability of maintaining our Commonwealth links, but also forweighty strategic and economic reasons.   The Nationalist Governmentswillingness to co-operate both in Middle East defence in wartime and in anti^ Communist measures represents a change in traditional policy which must be encouraged.   Moreover, our continued use of the Naval Base at Simonstown isof the utmost importance to us both in peace and in war.     Further, South africa is a source of supply for a number of raw materials of great importance to th-United Kingdom in peace-time and vital to us in time of war.  Economically the stability of the sterling area is dependent on the United Kingdom obtaining asubstantial part of South Africa&apos;s gold output and equally the Union furnishesan important market for our exports.   It must also be borne in mind that theHigh Commission Territories of Basutoland and Swaziland, and possibly the bechuanaland Protectorate as well, can at any time be economically strangled ifthe Union Government chooses to deny them essential facilities.  I suggest that each item might be considered in the light of these factors.Persons of Indian Origin in South Africa4.    This represents a direct clash between the Union on the one hand and India(together with Pakistan) on the other.   Clearly this debate will serve no useful purpose and the only helpful role that we can perform is to do our best to make itas short and as temperate as possible.   We could not discuss the merits withoutoffending either one side or the other.  Apart from this, it would be most unwise to be drawn into such a discussion because the subject appears to fall clearlywithin the sphere of South Africa&apos;s domestic jurisdiction and therefore (by virtue of Article 2(7) of the Charter) outside the scope of the United Nations.In 1946, we proposed that the question of the Assembly&apos;s competence should bereferred to the International Court of Justice for its opinion.   This proposal was defeated and, since then, the line our Delegation has taken has been that beforethe item can be discussed, the Courfs opinion should be obtained;  but we ourselves have not again formally proposed such a reference.   I recommend thatwe maintain our previous policy, subject to the modification that in future weshould not advocate a reference to the International Court of Justice except as a last resort in an attempt toprevent the passage of a thoroughly objectionableresolution (e.g. one which sought to establish the principle that the united nations was entitled to intervene in the political affairs of non-self-governingterritories).   For there is this disadvantage in a reference to the Court, thatwe should not be able sufficiently to control the wording of the question thatwould be put to it.   Thus the question might be phrased in such a way that theCourt was asked to give an opinion of the general effect of Article 2(7) of the charter with regard to the competence of the Assembly to discuss the politicalaffairs of non-self-governing territories.   The legal arguments are finelybalanced on this issue and there is considerable danger that the Court as atpresent composed would tend to show a bias against the Colonial powers.   Evenif the question posed were carefully limited, the Court might well express some general views unhelpful to the United Kingdom on the effect of Article 2(7) in examining its relevance to the limited issue.   An opinion of the Court thereforemight well establish the competence of the Assembly to discuss not only thisparticular issue but also general problems arising from the presence ofimmigrant peoples in our own Colonies (e.g. Indians in Kenya).5. The safest course for the United Kingdom Delegation to pursue, therefore, seems to be to do all they can, at the moment, to keep theidea of a reference to the Court in the background; to work for a moderate and short debate;  to seek to get both sides to discuss their differences directly;
to work for a moderately worded resolution; to play as inconspicuous a partin the debate as they can; and, in particular, to abstain on any resolutioncritical of South Africa.South Africa&apos;s Racial Policies6. This item encroaches even more obviously on the field of domesticjurisdiction.   As Appendix IIshows, we have already made our position, clear to the Government of India.   In reply to their request that we should intervenedirectly with the Union Government, we declined to do so on the ground thatthis was a matter which in our view clearly lay within the field of the Union&apos;internal jurisdiction.  A fortiori we could not support any attempt by theUnited Nations to intervene.   To do so would be a volte face.   Moreover, itwould be against our colonial interests to support such an attempt, for we might then we regarded as having consented to a debate that might later be quoted as a precedent for the discussion of matters within our own domesticjurisdiction (e. g. in relation to a colony).7, It must be remembered, however, that South Africa&apos;s racialpolicies have aroused strong emotions both here and elsewhere - especiallyin some of our colonial territories.   These feelings will be played on to thefull in New York and much will be made of the claim that this is a matter of human rights and therefore eligible for discussion in that context.   our reply must be that Article 2(7) of the Charter has overriding effect andprecludes discussion of the subject.   We should therefore vote against theinclusion of the item in the agenda.   If - despite our opposition - the item isdebated, our delegation should make a formal reservation that they do not regard the debate as setting a precedent;  should avoid committing themselvesto any expressions of opinion on the merits of the case, while making it clearthat their opposition to the inclusion of the item on the agenda relates solely to the question of competence;  and should be guided generally by the policy proposed in paragraph 5 for the item on people of Indian origin in South Africa.Since it is impossible to predict the manner in which the Assembly may decide to deal with the item, I recommend that our Delegation be given discretion to abstain on or vote against any resolutions that may be put forward.8. I should warn my colleagues that if the Assembly does decide toinclude this item in its Agenda - as it almost certainly will - the UnionGoverixment may well decide to withdraw their Delegation and take no furtherpart in the work of this session of the Assembly,   From time to time, SouthAfrican Ministers have even gone so far as to suggest that South Africamight withdraw altogether from the United Nations if the Assembly continues itshostile treatment of issues affecting South Africa,South-We st Africa9, There is, on the merits, something to be said in favour of theUnion&apos;s point of view.   In the first place she had a very reasonable case forincorporating the territory into the Union in 1946.   We then supported the UnionGovernment, and it seems probable that, but for the fact that South Africa&apos;sracial policy was even then causing concern, the Assembly would have agreed tothe proposal.   In view of the Assembly&apos;s rejection of the proposal, SouthAfrica admits that she remains internationally accountable for her administrationo  the territory.   What she has not so far been prepared to admit is that heraccountability is now to the United Nations.   This is v/hy she has not so faraccepted that part of the International Court&apos;s opinion which advises that theUnited Nations has rights of supervision in respect of South^West Africa
similar to those exercised by the League of Nations, including the right toreceive reports on the Territory and to examine written petitions relating to it.This is the crux of the disagreement between the Union and the rest of theUnited Nations,   The Union Government&apos;s attitude is based mainly on the belief that the opponents of their racial policy would seize the opportunities afforded by public debate of reports and petitions to criticise their domestic affairs.10. We can have some sympathy with the Union&apos;s attitude in viewof the hostile character of the Assembly&apos;s attitude in the past and in particular ofthe Fourth Committee (in which the South West African item would be debated).Moreover, the Court&apos;s opinion is only an advisory one and, as it has no bindingforce, the Union Government are within their strict legal rights in rejecting partof it;  our own legal experts have always been doubtful of the legal soundness ofthis particular part of the opinion.   Our predecessors however decided that advantage lay in accepting the Court&apos;s opinion as a whole.   My immediatepredecessor also agreed with this view, which has accordingly been expressedby our Delegation at the last two sessions of the General Assembly.   Even if itwere desirable, I consider that it would be very difficult to follow a differentcourse now.11. In considering our policy, regard must be had to the fact thatthe debate on this item will take place in the Fourth Committee (which discussescolonial questions).   Feeling in this Committee is strongly anti-colonial, and inrecent years it has been endeavouring to enlarge its powers beyond the scope laiddown by the Charter of the United Nations.   The Colonial Powers have to be constantly on the alert to frustrate these attempts.   Hitherto we have been reasonably successful in this contest.   In particular we have been able to preserve the principles listed in the Annex to C. (52) 232 on which the Cabinet recentlyagreed that we could not yield (C.C.(52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 7).   One ofthese principles is likely to be challenged during the forthcoming debate on South-West Africa, since it is possible that the anti-colonials may make a further attemptto maintain their claim that the Fourth Committee is entitled to hear oral evidence from petititoners from South-West Africa.   It would be but a short step from this to claim the right of the United Nations to hear oral evidence from petitioners from non-self-governing territories.   We could not concede the latter claim; but ourposition would be undermined if even the former were re-asserted by the FourthCommittee and put into effect without protest from ourselves.   To this extent our interests lie in the same direction, as those of the Union Government.12. On the other hand, we must be careful to avoid giving the south africans any encouragement to think that they can be sure of our support if theyadopt an unconciliatory attitude to the Fourth Committee.   If they were to do so,feeling in the Fourth Committee would become exacerbated, with consequent riskof danger to our own interests.   Moreover, we must remember that much of theopposition to South Africa on this issue arises from the feeling that unless SouthAfrica is made accountable to an international body like the United Nations for its administration of South-West Africa, the inhabitants of that territory will be exposed without any defence to the Union&apos;s racial legislation.   We cannot ignorethis sentiment and we must therefore avoid giving the impression by our actionsin the Assembly that we are indifferent to the fate of these peopoe.    These two factors impose definite limits on the extent to which we can go in supportingSouth Africa.13. Taking all these factors into consideration, I feel that the best course for our Delegation to adopt would be to advise the South African Delegation(if it is still present when this item is discussed) to adopt a conciliatory attitude, andto ccsnsel moderation generally while avoiding the impression that we are preparedto compromise the happiness of the inhabitants of the territory.   If a solution
is proposed which offers some hope of acceptance but which does not entirelycomply with the Courfs opinion, our Delegation should not reject it on that groundalone.   They should not regard themselves as entirely fettered by our advocacyof that opinion as a whole,   Should the South Africans directly challenge that opinion, however, we would have no alternative but to support it.   If this policyis accepted, it is proposed to inform the South African Government in advance thatthis is the limit to which we can go in supporting them on this item.14. It is therefore recommended:-(i)  On the problem of people of Indian origin in South Africathat our policy should be to work for a moderate debate; to seek toget both sides to discuss their differences directly; to workfor a moderately worded resolution;  to play as inconspicuous apart in the debate as possible and to abstain on any resolution critical of South Africa.(li) On South Africa&apos;s rscial policy(a) that we should vote against the inclusion of the item in theAgenda on the ground that it is a matter of domestic jurisdiction,to which Article 2(7) of the Charter applies;(b) that if it is included in the Agenda our intervention in debate should be limited to a restatement of our views, including thepoint that our opposition to the inclusion of the item on th-agenda relates solely to the question of competence;(c) that the Delegation should be given discretion to abstain on or vote against any resolution.(iii) On the problem of South-West Africa(a) that the United Kingdom Delegation should work for a moderatedebate in order to prevent points of principle arising affectingour own vital interests;  defend our interests should suchpoints arise (e. g. the hearing of oral petitioners) while avoiding any implication that in doing so we necessarily agree with south African policies; help the South Africans by counsellingmoderation; and endeavour to persuade them to make concessions to the majority view that the opinion of the International Courtof Justice must be accepted as a whole, including the obligationto osubmit reports to the United Nations and of acknowledgingtheir right to receive written petitions;(b) that if, in spite of our efforts at moderation, a head-on clashwere to occur on the question of the validity of theInternational court  s opinion, we should make it plain that weadhere to the view that it should be accepted as a whole;(c) that the Union Government should be told in advance the limitswithin which we are prepared to support them.15. The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Statehave seen this memorandum and are in general agreement with my recommendations.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.24th September, 1952.
THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE OP INDIAN ORIGININ THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.The Government of India first brought this question before theUnited Nations in 1946;   the origins of it go back to 1860, when the first Indiancoolies were brought to Natal.2. The Indian community in South Africa consists mainly of thedescendants of coolies and of the Indian traders who followed them, and nownumbers about a quarter of a million (almost all of whom are concentrated inNatal, the United Party stronghold) in a total population of 11-g- millions.   Thecommunity has protested for many years about disabilities imposed on it inrelation to the Europeans (though these are less than those imposed on the natives).These disabilities include the denial of the vote in Natalj and Transvaal and the orange Free State, restrictions on inter-Provincial movement, on the acquisition and occupation of property, difficulties in the way of taking up certain forms ofemployment and trade, and the various regulations segregating the races in public vehicles, public offices and similar places.3. The Indian and South African delegations took up in 1946 the samebroad positions as they maintain today.   The Indians said that the Union Government&apos;^treatment of Indians in South Africa constituted a denial of human rights, and asked the Assembly to call upon the Union Government to revise its policiesaccordingly.   The South Africans maintained that the matter was one of SouthAfrican domestic jurisdiction and that, under Article 2(7) of the United nations charter, the United Nations had no competence to intervene.   The UnitedKingdom suggested that the question of competence be referred to the international court;  this suggestion was turned down by the Assembly when put to the vote.4. Since 1947 Pakistan has appeared on the international scene andhas felt obliged to support the   Indians on this issue, though she has never played a prominent part in the debates.   The Nationalist Government in South Africawhich took power in 1948 has based its policy on the principle of apartheid(segregation) for non-European South Africans, and the Indian governments attitude has also hardened, particularly since the introduction of the Group AreasBill in 1950.5. Partly owing to the United Kingdom&apos;s influence, talks took placein Cape Town early in 1950 between the representatives of India and pakistan and South Africa, and resulted in tentative agreement to hold a round table conference to negotiate for a settlement.   The Conference was never held, as theIndian Government refused to take part in such a conference while the south africans persisted with their racial policies.6. The Resolution adopted at last year&apos;s Assembly recommended thatthe Governments of India, Pakistan and South Africa should set up a commissionof three members to negotiate for the settlement of the problem.   If theGovernments did not nominate the members of the commission, the Secretary-General was authorised to lend his assistance to the Governments to facilitatenegotiations, either in person or by appointing someone to represent him.   TheResolution further called upon the South African Government to suspend further action under the Group Areas Act and gave it as the opinion of the Assembly thata policy of apartheid is necessarily based on doctrines of racial discrimination.We abstained on the voting for this Resolution.rl.:
3lj.7.   The South Africans later informed the Secretary-General that they did not accept the Resolution as it constituted intervention in a matter within the Union&apos;sdomestic jurisdiction, and said, as they have often said in the past, that they were willing to take part in negotiations with the Indians and Pakistanis outside the purview of the United Nations on the lines tentatively agreed in 1950.   the indians and Pakistanis thereupon said that, in view of the South African attitude,nomination by them of a representative on the three-man commission would serve no purpose.   The commission has therefore not been set up.8,    The Secretary-General has made a tentative approach to the South Africans,as authorised by last year&apos;s resolution, to see whether he could do anything tohelp, but the South Africans have rejected his initiative, and he is expected toreport failure to the Assembly in New York.APPENDIX IISOUTH AFRICA&apos;S RACIAL policy the Government of India in a memorandum dated 2nd Aprilexpressed their great concern at &quot;the gradual accumulation of tension and ofelements of racial conflict in South Africa&quot;.   The memorandum went on todevelop the Indian Government&apos;s attitude on the question of Indians in South africa and then expressed regret that no important European group in South Africa had yet questioned the moral validity of the apartheid laws in connection with the separate Representation of Voters Act.   It went on to draw our attention to thecivil resistance campaign involving non-violent defiance of apartheid, which wasthen being planned and said that once the campaign started racial conflict mightspread beyond South Africa and awake a sympathetic response in India and many other countries.   The Indian Government therefore hoped that we would exert all our influence with the Union Government in order (a) to ensure that civilresistance would be so handled as not to intensify racial antagonism;  and (b) tobring about some change in South Africa&apos;s racial policies which are injuringthe cause of world peace.2. The United Kingdom Government replied on 24th April to the effectthat we saw objection to the proposed intervention with the Union Government andthat in particular, to advise the Union Government how to deal with the civildisobedience campaign would constitute intervention of a most direct characterin the Union&apos;s internal affairs, which would not only be useless but might evenexacerbate feeling.   We were therefore not prepared to act upoki the IndianGovernmenfs suggestion,3. The Indian High Commissioner sent me a further memorandumon 17th July which was mainly addressed to the issue of Indians in South Africa.It also drew attention to the aspirations of the indigenous population of SouthAfrica and said that in the Indian Governmenfs view &quot;a spirit of sympathy and progressive liberalism is essential if racial conflicts between the membersof the politically dominant and the politically subject races in Africa are not todegenerate into violent conflicts..., which might prove disastrous to our hopes ofestablishing lasting peace...    If the purposes of the United Nations are tobecome a reality, neither national sovereignty nor the view that any issues thatgravely menace these purposes are exclusively domestic, can be regarded orargued as postulates which would not require consideration or may not Suffermodification&quot;.
4. No reply was sent to this last memorandum.   We felt that we hadsufficiently set forth our own views in the memorandum summarised inparagraph 2 above and that there was no point in controverting again theIndian views.5, On 11th September the Indian High Commissioner gave me a further memorandum, which said that the Indians would be raising the question of race relations in South Africa at the Assembly and asked for our support in getting the Assembly to take note of the passive resistance campaign, expressdisapproval of South Africa&apos;s racial policies and recommend to the UnionGovernment that, in the interests of peace, they revise their racial policies&quot;in accordance with the principles of the Charter&quot;.   If the proposals in the body of this paper are approved I intend to inform the Indian Government that wecannot comply with their request.APPENDIX IIISOUTH WEST AFRICA.South West Africa is the only remaining former Mandated territory which has neither acquired independence nor been placed under the United Nationstrusteeship system.   In 1946, at its first session, General Smuts asked for theGeneral Assembly&apos;s agreement to the incorporation of South West Africa inthe Union, since consultations had shown that this was the strong desire of theEuropean and of the majority of the native inhabitants.   He was supported by theUnited Kingdom delegate since we were convinced that the consultations had been fairly conducted.   The General Assembly, however, refused to accede to general smuts&apos; request and for several years at each successive General Assembly theSouth Africans were pressed to place the Territory under the trusteeship system.2. In 1949, largely as a result of United Kingdom initiative, theInternational Court of Justice was asked to define the legal position.   The CourfsAdvisory Opinion, given in 1950, was briefly to the effect that although the union was under no legal obligation to place South West Africa under the trusteeship system it was accountable to the United Nations for the Territory to the same extent as it had previously been to the League of Nations, including the obligationto submit reports to the United Nations and to take cognisance of petitionsaddressed to that organisation.   Competence to change the status of the Territorylay with South Africa acting with the consent of the United Nations.3. The 1950 General Assembly, largely at the instigation of theUnited Kingdom, adopted a resolution accepting the Courfs opinion as a whole and setting up an Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate with South Africa on suitable arrangements for carrying out the court  s opinion.   South Africa, although notaccepting the Courfs opinion in its entirety, agreed to join in negotiations.This Committee made certain suggestions, which were rejected by the south africans, for supervisory arrangements similar to those of the League of Nations.The Union&apos;s own counter-proposals proved unacceptable to the Committee since thecontained no provision for reports and petitions.4. Discussion of the problem in the Fourth Committee (the dependent territories Committee) of the 1951 General Assembly was prejudiced from the start by the Committee&apos;s decision to invite certain South West African tribalchiefs to give oral testimony before it.   In common with the South Africans,we opposed this decision as being unconstitutional under the United Nations
3foCharter.   The South African Delegation having failed to obtain a reversal of theCommittee&apos;s decision withdrew from it for the remainder of the Assembly.In the event, the Union authorities refused to allow the tribal chiefs to attend the Assembly.   In their absence the Fourth Committee heard statements bythe Reverend Michael Scott.5, The Fourth Committee passed two resolutions which were adopted by the General Assembly,   The first reiterated earlier resolutionsthat the Territory should be placed under trusteeship while the other continued the Ad Hoc Negotiating Committee until the next Assembly and at the same timesolemnly called upon the Union to honour its international obligations.The United Kingdom Delegation abstained on both resolutions;  on the firstbecause the International Court had advised that the Union was under no suchobligation, on the second because of its gratuitously offensive implications.6. The Union Government is at present engaged in further negotiations with the Ad Hoc Committee.
