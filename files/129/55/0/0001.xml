secret.(52) 301 COPY NO. LA*16TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETJAPAN&apos;S APPLICATION TO ACCEDE TO THE GENERALAGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn E.A. (52) 110, I sought authority for lodging objection to the use by japan of an inter sessional procedure under which tariff negotiations could be held between contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) and newcomers as a preliminary to the accession of the latter tothe G.A.T.T.  That authority was given on 30th July (E.A.(52) 23rd Meeting,Minute 6).   I pointed out in E.A. (52) 110 that, even.if a sufficient number ofsuch objections were lodged, this would secure only a short deferment as thequestion of her application to enter into tariff negotiations with a view toaccession would then fall to be discussed at the Seventh Session of the contracting parties in October and that we should then have to decide what attitude the United Kingdom should adopt on that occasion towards the application.2. This stage has now been reached.   The United Kingdom, Australiaand New Zealand voted against the use of the inter sessional procedure.   Threevotes were necessary to secure that Japan&apos;s application should be deferred fordiscussion at the Seventh Session.   We have, therefore, been successful in our immediate objective.   France, Norway and the three Benelux countries replied to the Secretariat of the G.A.T.T. to the effect that, in their view, the Japaneseapplication should be referred to the Seventh Session;  the Secretariat wouldhave regarded the replies as votes against the use of the inter sessional procedureif three clear votes had not been cast in any event against its use.3. Before coming to the question of our line of action at the G.A.T.T.session, I should indicate briefly the practical effects which would follow if, asa result of Japan&apos;s being admitted, to membership of the Agreement, we and theother existing parties became obliged to accord to her the treatment providedfor by the terms of the Agreement as they at present stand.   The main effect would be that all countries members of the G.A.T.T. would be under an obligationto give most-favoured-nation treatment to Japanese trade.   This gives riseto special difficulties in regard to Commonwealth trade, which are explainedbelow, but it is also a general difficulty for us that foreign countries will be driven to raise their tariffs in order to protect their own industries against japan and that because of the most-favoured &quot;nation Article our exports will suffer from these measures.   All countries whose exports are vital to their economy will no doubt be sensitive to this point.   We are probably the country that will be mostaffected because Japan&apos;s exports and ours are competitive over such a wide field.It would seem impossible to find any solution to this problem without allowing opendiscrimination against Japan, and it is evident that few other countries are preparedto deny most-favoured-nation rights to Japan.4. It is, therefore, all the more important that we should try to find asolution to the special problems that would be created for Commonwealth trade by Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T.  The grant of most-favoured-nation rights
to Japan by the countries of the Commonwealth would matter less if, as in pre-wardays, all of us in the Commonwealth were free to take, without any effect on theHX duties which we charge on one another&apos;s goods, the alternative course of raising,v^ in respect of those classes of goods in which Japanese competition is acute,the duties applicable to imports of such goods from all foreign sources.   Butthe position is now quite different in that, under the &quot;no new preference rule&quot; of theG.A.T.T., Commonwealth countries are not free to raise the duty on foreign-made imports of any class of goods without increasing correspondingly the rateapplicable to British goods.   Thus, for example, if Australia were obliged togive Japan the treatment provided for in the G.A.T.T. in order to give her owncotton textile industry increased protection against Japanese textiles she wouldhave not only to increase the import duty on cotton textiles from all foreigncountries, but also, in order to comply with the no new preference rule, toincrease equivalently the preferential duties on our cotton textiles;  and the samewould apply elsewhere in the Commonwealth.   It is primarily this effect of theno new preference rule of dragging up British preferential rates when Common-wealth countries raise their general tariff rates that makes the question of japanese admission to G.A.T.T. so difficult for us.   I may mention in thisconnection that the Chairman of the Cotton Board, in discussion with myDepartment, is now strongly pressing the view that, since Lancashire cannotrely on the indefinite continuance of quota restrictions, either in the independent commonwealth countries or in the Colonies, as a means of protection againstthe competition of Japan, it is essential to make the strongest effort to obtain,as an alternative, substantially larger tariff preferences in these marketsover Japanese goods.5. It is evident that we could not willingly permit the coming about ofsuch a situation, in which the whole Commonwealth would be bound hand andfoot not to raise duties against cheap Japanese goods save by means which would gravely injure intra-Commonwealth trade as a whole and in particular our export trade to Commonwealth markets.   It is true that there exists Article XXXVof the .G.A.T.T., which would enable us in respect of the United Kingdom andthe Colonies, and the other Commonwealth countries in respect of their ownterritories to contract out of all obligations under the G.A.T.T. towards Japan.But it is certain that India, Pakistan and Ceylon would not exercise this right.Nor on the whole is it probable that the older Dominions would do so;  they andother countries are likely to feel that, if Japan is to be invited into the G.A.T.T.the members should be prepared to give her the benefits of the G.A.T.T.  Theexistence of Article XXXV does not therefore materially ease for us thedifficulties which, essentially as a result of the no new preference rule, the accession of Japan to the G.A.T.T. would create for our export trade.THE PROBLEM AT THE SEVENTH SESSION6. The question at issue at the Seventh Session will be whether japan should be regarded as an acceptable candidate for. accession and, if so, when and where tariff negotiations between her and those contracting parties who wishto negotiate with her should be held.   This issue is for decision by a simple majority vote.   Whatever the decision, a contracting party which did not wish tonegotiate with Japan could not be obliged to do so.   If the decision at the seventh Session is favourable to Japan, the contracting parties will considerlater, in the light of the results of the tariff negotiations, whether Japan should beallowed to accede;  at that stage Japan will need the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the contracting parties in order to accede.   If these votes are obtained,it will then be for any country which has not entered into tariff negotiations with japan to decide whether to invoke Article XXXV of the General Agreement andthus to refuse to bind itself to apply the Agreement to Japan.LIKELY ATTITUDE OF OTHER COUNTRIES7. The attitude of the United States has changed since I consulted mycolleagues in E.A. (52) 110 and now appears to be as follows.   They are likely
to sponsor a resolution which would welcome the application of Japan to enter intotariff negotiations with a view to accession and are likely to resist any attempt by other contracting parties to reject the Japanese application during the OctoberSession.   As already explained, if the matter were pressed to a vote, theywould only need to obtain the support of a bare majority of the contractingparties.   They could count on the support of the Asiatic countries (India,Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma and Indonesia) and they may well be able to influence the Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,Haiti, Nicaragua and Peru) to vote on their side.   The U. S.A. will, moreover,get support from European countries.   Sweden is anxious to enter into tariff negotiations with Japan;  the attitude of Denmark appears to be similar.Germany, Italy, Turkey and Czechoslovakia have stated that they had no objectionto the use of the intersessional procedure.   France has indicated that she would not formally oppose the accession of Japan but would make it clear thatshe would not herself grant most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan.   Even thenon-Asiatic Commonwealth countries are probably not united in opposition tothe accession of Japan;  South Africa did not object to the use by Japan of theintersessional procedure although she does not intend to enter into tariff negotiations with Japan.   (Canada did not vote against the use of the intersessionalprocedure apparently because she found that three votes had already been castagainst its use.)COURSES OPEN TO THE UNITED KINGDOM8. Clearly our delegation at Geneva should in the first place see whetherthey can persuade the United States and a majority of other countries effectively to postpone a substantive decision.   But it is virtually certain that the UnitedStates will reject a course involving overt delay and that we shall have to dealwith a resolution definitely agreeing to Japan&apos;s entering into tariff negotiationswith other countries with a view to acceding to the G.A.T.T.). The line that our Delegation at Geneva should take on such a Resolutionhas been discussed with Foreign Office and Treasury officials.   It is common ground that we should have to make it plain that, in our own case, the question of japan&apos;s accession raised special and difficult problems.   Our delegation should refer to the fact that Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are currently reviewing their whole commercial policy;  they should indicate ingeneral terms that the question of Japanese accession (for the reasons givenin paragraphs 3 and 4- above) presents especial difficulties for us so long asCommonwealth trade is subject to the rigidities and inhibitions of the no newpreference rule, and that unless these difficulties can be smoothed out by achange in the rules we shall not ourselves enter into tariff negotiations with japan and it might be necessary for us to invoke Article XXXV.10. The view of Foreign Office and Treasury officials, I understand, is that having made our own position clear in this manner, we should not oppose theresolution, nor even abstain from voting on it, but should vote for it.   Theyconsider that as our abstention would be quite ineffective we should be incurringJapanese ill-will to no purpose, whereas a positive vote for the resolution, eventhough we had made the reservation described in paragraph 9 would have somepositive value in our relations with the United States and Japan.   They suggestfurthermore that in exchange for our support we might be able to secure thatthe resolution was in a form which required Japan&apos;s tariff negotiations to becarried out at a full tariff conference of the contracting parties (an arrangement which would probably delay the negotiations until late in 1953).11. I consider that it would not be consistent on our part to make astatement about our difficulties as described ?.n paragraph 9, and then to vote fora resolution designed to facilitate Japan&apos;s accession.   Nor could we do so without incurring violent criticism from the Lancashire cotton industry and from our-3-
other industries which are looking to us to do the little that we can to help them over the problem of Japanese competition in their export markets.   A vote for such a resolution will be taken by most people in this country to mean quitesimply that we want Japan in the G.A.T.T. with all that that implies.   No technicalexplanations or excuses about the various stages of admission or escape clausesare likely to alter this opinion.   Our industries look to the Government to givea lead to other Governments and especially to Commonwealth Governments torefuse to commit themselves to giving most-favoured-nation rights to Japan.In this country it will appear the worst weakness to have voted in favour of aresolution which is bound to lead to the difficulties about which we will havewarned the other contracting parties in our statement.   I, therefore, recommendthat having made our position clear we should abstain from voting on theresolution.12. If we proceed on this basis in the G.A.T.T. discussions, we should,I recommend, continue as hitherto to say in public in the United Kingdom thatit continues to be our policy not to commit ourselves to giving most-favoured-nation rights to Japan.   We are, it is true, continuing to give her most-favoured-nation treatment, but we actually restrict imports from her severely forbalance of payments reasons.   For convenience, I attach details of statements on this subject by the previous Government and my own statement.To support Japan&apos;s application by our vote at the forthcoming session of.A.T.T. would be in reality, and still more in appearance, an important step towards securing for her a guarantee of most-favoured-nation righsand would not be, at any rate easily, reconcilable with my own statement inthe debate on the Japanese Peace Treaty.   It appears moreover from statements of the previous Government that we would be quite likely to be attacked forsuch a course from the left flank as well as from the right.13. I therefore recommend that -(i)   Our Delegation at Geneva should explore the possibilities of securing a delay on the lines described in paragraph 8 above.(ii)  If our Delegation is unable to Secure such a delay, they should make astatement of our difficulties as described in paragraph 9 andabstain from voting on the resolution.(iii)  In public statements we should continue to say that it remains our policy not to commit ourselves to give most-favoured-nation rights to Japan.(iv)   This course of action should be discussed with other commonwealth countries&apos; officials at the pre-G.A.T.T. discussions next,week.P. T.Board of Trade, S. W.l.,16TH SEPTEMBER, 1952.
DETAILS OF GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS (see paragraph 12)1. In answer to a Parliamentary Question from Mr. Anthony Greenwoodon the 19th March, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade , Mr. Harold&quot;Wilson, included in his reply the following sentences -&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whetherthey could take the step of entering into a formal undertaking..........to extend most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan, and theyhave decided that in all the circumstances they should not enterinto such an obligation. &quot;&quot;......His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to accord to japanese goods the benefit of the most-favoured-nation tariff,but it would be unwise for us to tie our hands in any way until thefuture course of the Japanese economy and of Jetpanese commercialpolicies have become more clearly established. &quot;2. In a supplementary reply to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. Asshetonon 26th July, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade, Sir hartley shawcross, said -&quot;We have made it quite clear that we can give no undertaking toextend most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan in the future. &quot;3. At the opening of the Geneva Session of the Contracting Parties on19th September, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade, Sir hartley shawcross, said that if Japan applied for full membership of the G.A.T.T.,Britain would have seriously to consider whether she could extend to her obli-gations already extended to the original members.   He went on to say that thequestion of Japan being admitted as a member of the G.A.T.T. had not yetarisen, and &quot;at present, we have no intention of granting her most-favoured&quot;nation rights. &quot;4. On 2Sth November, 1951, on winding up the debate on the second reading of the Japanese Treaty of Peace Bill, I made the following statement -&quot;I was asked.......what our attitude would be about most&quot;&quot;favoured-nation treatment.   My answer is that to-day weextend most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan, but we are under no obligation to do so under the Treaty that we have signed, norwill we tie ourselves to do so because it would, in these circum-stances, be unwise, with the future as uncertain as it is.   the truth is - and I would say this to those who attack us -that this country is free to impose quotas, to put on tariffs or to discriminate against Japanese trade coming into this Island. &quot;
