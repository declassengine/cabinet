SECRET Copy No.   J QC. (52) 307 (Revise)5th December, 1952CABINETSUPER-PRIORITY FOR THE B. 35 BOMBER aircraft memorandum by the Minister of supply ask that super-priority should be granted for the B. 35 bomber aircraft,which have been ordered from A. V. Roe, Ltd., and Handley Page, Ltd. I made this proposal in my paper C. (52) 187 which was considered by the Cabinet on12th June, but a decision was deferred pending the review of the defence programme (C.C. (52) 59th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. The creation of a modern jet bomber force is essential to the globalstrategy approved recently by the Cabinet. Yet, even with the grant of super-priority it is most unlikely that the first aircraft can be delivered to the R.A.F.in much less than three years. If super-priority is not granted delivery dates will fall back by at least a year and probably longer.D. S.Ministry of Supply, S.W. 1,5th December, 1952.43334Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952
