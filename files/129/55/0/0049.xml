\SlCONFIDENTIALC.(52) 349 COPY NO.   &quot;7^21st OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETEGYPT:  REQUEST FOR JET aircraft memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.On 17th September the Egyptians made a formal request to us forthe release of 65 jet aircraft which were ordered in 1950.   The value of these aircraft is over  2 millions, and the Egyptians have paid a 20% deposit onthis sum.   The following is a list of the aircraft in question:-3 Meteor Mark 7 Trainers24 Meteor Mark 8 Fighters16 Vampire D.H. 113 Night Fighters22 Vampire Mark 52 Day Fighters together with 18 sets of components.2. The supply of these aircraft was interrupted in 1950 on account ofthe increased needs of our own and Western defence forces, and the embargo was maintained in view of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Wafd Government in egypt and successive Governments.   The supply position is now such that we can afford to sell jet aircraft to Middle Eastern states;  indeed, I understand that, from thepoint of view of the aircraft industry, it is desirable that we should supply atany rate Meteors in the near future.   In fact we have just agreed to supply 14jet aircraft each to Iraq, Syria and The Lebanon and 14 to Israel.   So far as theEgyptian request is concerned, we have merely replied that we are consideringthe matter in the light of the present Anglo-Egyptian relations.   Meanwhile,however, we have taken the preliminary step of clearing with the Near EastArms Co-ordinating Committee in Washington a proposal to release3 Meteor Mark 7 Trainers and 12 Meteor Mark 8 Fighters.   The way is nowtherefore clear for us to release these 15 Meteor aircraft if we wish.3. Apart from supply considerations, the arguments in favour of releasing these 15 aircraft now would appear to be that -(a) The new regime in Egypt may be more willing to take a realisticview of our defence requirements than previous Egyptian Governments,The release of these aircraft would be regarded in Egypt as a rather spectacular gesture on our part and might encourage the moderate elements in the new regime.   H.M. Ambassador atCairo has strongly recommended that we should release as manyof these jet aircraft as possible.(b) Conversely the egyptians are bound to be upset when they learn of &apos;our recent decision to sell jet aircraft to other Arab countries and to Israel if we do not let them have jets as well.(c) If we do not release these aircraft, it is probable that the Egyptianswill try to get them elsewhere, possibly from the americans orthe French.   It might even be that a refusal by us will determine theEgyptian Air Force to turn to American equipment as a general
practice.   It is estimated that it would take them at least twoyears to rebuild their Air Force on American equipment, and apart from everything else, this enforced delay would probablyembitter them.   In any event, if we are going to allow theEgyptian Air Force to revive, it would be preferable that sucha revival should be an Anglo-Egyptian operation, since this wouldfit in with our ideas for the ultimate establishment of a joint anglo-Egyptian air defence organisation as part of our defence arrangements with Egypt.The Arguments against releasing the aircraft are that -(a) We have as yet nothing definite to show how the new regime&apos;policy towards us is going to develop.   The internal situation inEgypt is still uncertain and the day may come when for one reason or another the new Egyptian Government may find it convenient to revive the old anti-British and Imperialist slogans.   We do not wish to give the Egyptian Government the impression that they have only to make demands upon us for us to give way.(b) The Israelis have already protested against the provision of jet aircraft to other Arab countries, and H, M. Ambassador at Tel Avivhas warned us that the effect in Israel will be very bad if werelease these aircraft to Egypt unless we can at the same timeinduce theEgyptian Government to state that they would be preparedto start peace negotiations with Israel.(c)       We have with some difficulty maintained a general embargo onthe supply of arms to Egypt from other countries.   There is little doubt that, whatever arguments we may use, we shall be unable tomaintain this embargo in being if we release these aircraft.We shall thus be weakening, and probably ultimately destroying,one of our strongest bargaining levers with the Egyptians.4. I do not think that we need worry unduly about the risk that theEgyptian Air Force might use these jet aircraft against us at some future date.The Egyptian Air Force is not comparable with a modern Air Force in itsstandards of training, its equipment or its general effectiveness.   The supplyof these aircraft would not change this state of affairs.5. I have considered carefully whether we should not try to obtain some quid pro quo from Egypt in return for the release of jet aircraft.   In my view a suitable return would be Egyptian agreement to lift the restrictionsat present in force upon the traffic of Israel-bound cargoes through the suez canal, or an Egyptian declaration of readiness to make peace with Israel.   ButI am advised that the chances of our securing such undertakings from Egyptare very small.   The United States Government are unwilling to join us in an approach to the Egyptian Government on these lines at present.   H.j.vi. ambassador at Cairo considers that if we try to link the release of these aircraft with suchundertakings, we shall simply throw away any advantage which this gesturewould otherwise have given us.   He thinks that the most we should ask for shouldbe a statement by General Neguib that the strengthening of the Egyptian armed forces was a purely defensive measure, with no specific mention of Israelat this stage.   H.M. Ambassador at Tel Aviv has, however, advised that such aguarantee would be totally inadequate.
6. On balance I recommend as follows:-(a) We should decide to release to Egypt the 15 Mark and Mark 8 Meteors now.(b) H.M. Ambassador at Cairo should be instructed so to inform general Neguib, and to add that this is intended as an indication of confidence on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   Heshould make it clear at the same time that the release of anymore jet aircraft will depend upon how Egyptian policy  develops.If, for example, the Egyptians were to make a contributionto the stability of the Middle East by taking some definitestep towards settling their differences with Israel, such as an intimation of their readiness to make peace, or by joiningin due course with the Western Powers in a defence organisation for the Middle East, this would obviously make it easier forus to supply more jet aircraft in the future.   At the very least,the Egyptian Government should state publicly, as soon as the news becomes known, that these aircraft are required purelyfor training and that theEgyptian Government have no intentionof using them for any aggressive purposes,(c) We should give the best assurances we can to the israeli government, in the light of anything that General Neguib maysay to H.M, Ambassador at Cairc.. (d)      We should decide about the release of the remainder of the 65jet aircraft to Egypt in the light of the Egyptian response to our offer of 15.(c)      We should inform the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation andother European countries interested of the position at the sametime as we make the offer to Egypt.A.E.Foreign Office, S.
