fVtGfc(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1^ GOVERNMENT)ONFIDENTIALC. (52) 330 COPY NO. 7 ^11th OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETGALL-UP OF YOUNG AGRICULTURAL workers memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Minister of Labour&apos;s paper, C. (52) 323, has forestalled mein taking up with him, and with my colleagues, the serious labour situation inagriculture.2, The facts are these.(i) Up to 1949 an encouraging build-up of regular workers in agriculture.(ii) In 1950 a rough balance between supply and demand.(iii) This was held to justify the last Governments decision toremove exemption from call-up in 1951, which agricultural workers had had since February, 1946.   Even this had to be deferred tillNovember, 1951, to ensure the gathering of that year&apos;s corn androot harvest.(iv) The favourable trend up to 1949 has since been reversed most seriously.   In three years there has been a net loss in GreatBritain of 54,000 regular farm workers out of 673,000.   The rateis increasing - in annual figures, June to June, it has been 10,000,21,000 and 23,000.(v) At this rate of loss we shall next year have less regular workers inagriculture than we had in 1939, although we are producing far morefood.(vi) The call-up accounts for some 9,000 of the net loss of 23,000 in1951/52.   There will be a similar loss in 1952/53 if there is no alteration in call-up arrangements,(vii) Although after that the men first called up should be coming back,there is very serious doubt whether anything like the number called up will return to the farms.3. These losses will have a serious effect on our food production plans for increasing output to at least 60 per cent above pre-war by 1956, comparedwith about 44 per cent today.   On reasonable but optimistic assumptions aboutcontinuing increase in output per man, there will be a gap in the next two yearsof around 15,000 men between the minimum requirement for the programme andthe probable labour supply on current trends.
4. It is the skilled regular workers, for whom there is no substitute,that we are losing - particularly men under 30.The present deferment arrangements make no provision for the youngmen on the larger farms with experience of tractors and modern machinery;a lot of our food production depends on these farms and th.se men,6. Again, we are trying hard to give the people more British meat.   Menare essential to tend and provide feed for the increasing numbers of cattle,sheep and pigs.   More machines are not the answer.   But no provision is made fordeferment of stockmen unless they are full-time.7. In this situation farmers cannot understand how we can allow the call-up to go on when we are pressing them to increase their output.   They are convinced the men could not possibly be mobilised in event of war and they feelunable to do their job without them now.   They say that ploughing grants and calfsubsidies without labour do not make sense.   It is one of my hardest jobsto convince them that the Government are in earnest.8. The agricultural need could be met without granting exemption.This could be doneby allowing all those working in agriculture to be eligible for consideration of deferment, whatever the size of the farm and whatever the job done.   This should include men working for agricultural contractors.The grant of deferment would then depend on recommendations ofthe agricultural advisory panels after taking account of the effect on food production,and possibilities of rearrangement of work and of substitution, as under present arrangements.9a The case for relaxation of call-up in agriculture is:-(i) We must reduce the fall in our regular agricultural labour force.(ii) We have to persuade farmers that we are in earnest about morefood production.10. The case against is:-(i) Agriculture should make its contribution to national service.(ii) Others will ask for similar concessions.(iii) The Services cannot afford the loss to them.11. My answers are:-(i) Agriculture would still be making a contribution, even though small;but the special deferment arrangements would ensure that thosereally needed for food production are kept back.(ii) Agriculture and coal mining needed special treatment in 1946 to 1951,and so they do today;   this will be generally recognised,(iii)    I realise that we must balance agriculture*s need against that of theServices,   But food is as necessary for our national existence as the armed Forces;  and I am sure that agriculture cannot afford to lose the experience and skill of the relatively few young men concernedc
12. I must ask therefore that the scope for deferment of call-up of youngagricultural workers shall now be extended as proposed in 8 above.W An eauly announcement to this effect would do a power ofgood to the food production drive.T.L.D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W.1.11th OCTOBER, 1952.
