i......^-a,--!confidential. (52) 315 COPY NO.j^30th SEPTEMBER, 1952.cabinet internation OIL INDUSTRY:FEDERAL GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS IN THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.As I informed my colleagues on the 4th September, the UnitedStates Attorney-General recently convened a Federal Grand Jury and instructedthem to consider whether the activities of the international cjil industry constituted a breach of the United States Anti-Trust laws (C.C.(52) 78th Conclusions, Minute 5),The scope of these proceedings is very wide and has provoked great indignationon the part of both British and American oil companies, a number of whichhave been served with sub-poenas requiring the production of books, records and correspondence over twenty years or more.   It is in fact a test case, since these are the first anti-trust proceedings aimed exclusively at companies&apos;activities outside the United States of America.2. Apart from the big five United States companies (Standard New Jersey,Gulf, Socony-Vacuum, Texas Oil Company, Standard California), Anglo-iranian oil Company (A.I.O.C.) have been sub-poena&apos;d through their office in New York,and Asiatic Petroleum Corporation (A.P.C. - an American subsidiary of Shell)have also been sub-poena&apos;d.   Personal sub-poenas have been served on mr. H. Wilkinson, a director of Shell Transport and Trading, in his capacity as president of A.P.C., and on three other officers of the Corporation.3. On the instructions of the Ministers concerned, certain action hasalready been taken, designed to stiffen the State Department in their efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of these proceedings.   Informal representationsat diplomatic level, emphasising the harmful effect public indictment of the oil companies will have in third countries, especially in the Middle East, havealready been made to the State Department.   We have asked theDutch and french governments to do likewise.   It was also agreed that, after consultation with theBritish companies and the State Department, we should take such action asmay be possible to prevent the production of certain documents on grounds ofnational interest.  A decision on this point is now urgent since the motionsby A.I.O.C. and the United States companies in the United States of AmericaCourts, challenging their sub-poenas, will be heard on the 1st October, and since the postponement A.I.O.C. secured for production of documents expireson the 3rd October.4,    The General IssueIt is for consideration whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should oppose,for all trading companies (i. e. not confining it to the oil industry), and on-1-
broad national grounds, the attempted application of the United States Anti-Trustlaws to activities of non-American companies outside the United States of America.In its simplest terms, to accept such application would me an that a Britishy%)mpany having some association with an American company, and having a^subsidiary company, office or other property in the United States, could atany time be subjected to penal proceedings before a United States Court for breach of the United States Anti-Trust laws, even though the acts complained of were done outside the U.S.A. and were not a breach of British law or of thelaw of the place in which they were done.   This raises the general question of the propriety of a country instituting penal proceedings in connectionwith things done outside that country by persons who are not nationals orresidents of that country.   Legal consideration at the highest level should begiven to this question^ to decide what, if any, cteps can be taken.   Unless we take a stand on this wider constitutional issue, British companies may wellbe deterred from entering into trading association with American companies oreven having business premises in the U.S.A. - and this at a time when both we and the Americans wish that dollar business should be developed.   Moreoverother foreign countries might be encouraged to adopt similar legislation to compel British overseas corporations to disclose details of their businessthroughout the world.   Consideration of this broader principle and of its implications will, however, take time.   In view of the time limits mentioned at paragraph 3 above, other more immediate action is desirable,5,    The Immediate issue the indictment of British oil companies in the United States Courts isa very serious matter.   Not only is the oil industry of major economic,strategic and political importance, but the disclosure of key documents, e,g,confidential agreements between the companies and foreign governments, cor-respondencebetween the companies and Her Majesty&apos;s Government, could be extremely prejudicial to the national interest.   Moreover to allow productionof such documents may assist the United States Courts to issue orders tobreak up inter-cqmpany arrangements on which depend the flow of oil to the free world.   In view of the fact that British companies have been enjoined to producecompany records and correspondence from their British archives on or aboutthe 3rd October, it is essential that these companies should be told by her majesty&apos;s Government that any documents or information likely to prejudice the national interest should be withheld.   It is also essential that they should notbe subjected to charges of contempt of court if they do not produce these records -as they have no wish to do.6.      Discussions have taken place with the British oil companies and theTreasury Solicitor on possible immediate protective action to be taken by her Majesty&apos;s Government and it is considered that the sending of a letter by her Majesty&apos;s Government to all British oil companies likely to be involved,on the lines of the draft at Annex A, would provide a certain measure ofprotection ad interim.   The letter has been drafted in such a way as to make clear both grounds of objection i. e. legal and strategic, to the United states administration, in the hope that this will have a salutary effect.   The objectof this letter is:-(i) to indicate Her Majesty&apos;s Governments general concern at attempts to expand United States jurisdiction under the Sherman Act to embraceactivities of British companies outside the U,S,A.(ii) to make it clear that production of certain documents by British companiescould endanger not only British interests but those of the Western Powers.(iii) to protect British nationals under personal sub-poena (e.g, Shell&apos;sDirectors),
f i &apos; v.   *The letter is not however a legal document in the sense that any legal action can be taken if United States Courts reject it.   In that event, such recourseas we have would be through diplomatic channels.7,      As drafted, the letter at Annex A in effect places on the companies the onus of deciding what documents to   submit, as they will have to decide whether release of a given document would prejudice or endanger theeconomic, strategic or political interests of Her Majesty&apos;s Government or ofthe Western Powers.   The companies have been informed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be willing to advise them.8.        The draft has been shown to the Netherlands Embassy who welcome itas being in line with their own thinking in respect of Shell&apos;s Dutch interests.Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Washington, has also been consulted.   They haveno comments but are consulting the State Department.   The latter have promised their views as soon as possible but, judging by the personal views expressed by State Department officials now in London, they are unlikely towant to express any opinion.9.        In view of the time element therefore I would invite rny colleagues1agreement to:-(i) authorising the despatch forthwith of the draft letter at Annex A to all british oil companies who may be involved in the United States Anti**Trustproceedings,(ii) taking legal advice on the wider constitutional issue as described at paragraph 4 above.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.30th September, 1952.ANNEX AThe claim by any foreign state to have the right to institute legal proceedings in connection with things done outside that state by persons who are british nationals or by British corporations is a matter of concern to her majesty&apos;s Government.Her Majesty&apos;s Government understand that in connection with proceedings in tha United States under the Anti-Trust Laws of the United States you have been or may be required or requested to produce documents and your officers have beenor may be required or requested to give information relating to the conduct ofyour business outside the United States.Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider it contrary to the national interest that, in response to such requirements or requests, you or your officers shouldproduce any documents, papers or other information relating to the conduct ofthe business of your company outside the United States, the disclosure of whichmay prejudice or endanger the economic, strategic or political interests ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government or the Western Powers.For the above reasons, any documents, papers or other information,falling within these categories, should not be provided.
