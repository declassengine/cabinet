confidential. (52) 35020th October, 1952CABINETINVESTMENT IN 1953: RECONSTRUCTION OF BLITZED CITYCENTRESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government it&apos;s &quot; Tommy this, an&apos; Tommy that,&quot; an&apos;&quot;chuck &apos;im out, the brute&quot;;But it&apos;s &quot; Saviour of &apos;is country,&quot; whenthe guns begin to shoot!(R. Kipling.)&quot; Of course, we must first concentrate, as we are doing,all available building labour on those parts of ourcities which have suffered most . . . .&quot; ..(Mr. Churchill, Central Hall,Westminster, 15th March, 1945.)1.   This is the story of the blitzed cities.2. Excluding London, there are 18 which suffered severe and concentratedwar damage. Since 1949 successive Ministers for Planning have contrived to get an &quot;investment allocation &quot; to enable some reconstruction to be done in. these18 cities. y&apos;&apos; &apos;;&quot;&apos;.&apos;&apos;/.&apos;      *: *&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; i,;&apos;v;-3.   Work has been carried out each year to the following value:  1949 and 1950:  2-3 million.1951:  3-5 million.1952:  4-5 million (estimated).4. This work is almost entirely financed by private developers, and consistsmainly of shops to replace those destroyed in the central shopping areas.Encouraged by promises made during the war, the Local Authorities bought thedevastated land in order to provide convenient plots for rebuilding. As soon asbuilding is allowed, rents and rates are paid to the Authority. At the moment the Authorities are incurring heavy expenditure (by way of loan charges) on idleland; so is the Exchequer, which pays a high rate of grant.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not feel able, however, to allocatemore than  2-5 million in 1953 to reconstruction. Completion of works in progress will take up to  2 million in 1953 and  700,000 in 1954. Therefore there will be only     million to allocate (among 18 cities) to new work in 1953.6. The rebuilding programmes are already running down. With only ^ million to pump in, most of them will come to a complete stop early next year.7. I have got to announce the allocation; Local Authorities and their Mem-bers are already clamouring for it. When it is known, there will be a bitter outcryand much agitation-questions, adjournment motions, deputations and press campaing.Copy No.9---:-:-Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952
8. There are 68 Parliamentary seats in these cities; 40 are held by theOpposition, who will lose no opportunity to attack and embarrass the 28 Govern-ment supporters who hold the other seats.9. Up to now we have been able to blame the steel shortage; this, people canunderstand. But that cock won&apos;t fight much longer. Everyone knows we canuse reinforced concrete or, in some cases, load-bearing walls. Besides, a lot of jobs either do not require new steel or require very little because the firms have italready in hand from salvage or from stock.10. Nor can we argue that labour freed from blitz reconstruction can be diverted to other more important work, except in a heavily over-loaded area likeCoventry. It is admitted that in^most of the eighteen cities the building labour fora modest reconstruction programme can be provided without interfering with otherbuilding programmes. In certain cities, such as Plymouth there is no other build-ing work in need of labour. Housing cannot absorb them all. So the men driftout of the building industry, or go oh the dole.11. The best way out would be to authorise &quot;in principle&quot; the starting ofnew work in 1953 to the value of a further  2 million; i.e., a total &quot; programme &quot;for the year of  4 - 5 million. But where any project was to be, and when it was to start, would be settled by the Minister of Works, through the machinery of the regional Building Committee (representing all Ministries concerned). The Com-mittee would only allow new work where it would not interfere with the progressof defence projects, industry, housing, schools; they would have special regard tothe labour situation in each locality.12. If we do this we can meet the local outcry even if the starting dates haveto be put off from month to month.13. In view of all the promises made to the blitzed cities I think we must recognise that there is a moral as well as a material problem. There is also apolitical problem.14. I must point out that most of these developers are still willing to spendtheir own money. They ask for no subvention, subsidy, or assistance; indeed theyare prepared to reduce the burden of public expenditure. If we put them off too long, we may put them off altogether.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,20th October, 1952.
