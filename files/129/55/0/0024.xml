(52) 324^|       7th OCTOBER,&apos; 1952.CABINETCHEMICAL WARFARE POLICYNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate a copy of aminute from the Minister of Defence.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.7th OCTOBER, 1952.PRIME MINISTER FROM MINISTER OF DEFENCEMINUTE of 30th SEPTEMBERGeneral Ridgway has asked the Standing Group for policy directionon chemical warfare.   In turn, the Standing Group have asked the MilitaryRepresentatives&apos; Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)to approve a directive to General Ridgway as follows:-J^. &apos;&quot;^ie P ^cy on Sas warfare is:- ^^^J(a) To be prepared to defend against possible enemy employmentof such agents against Allied forces and their installations.(b) To be prepared in the event of enemy employment to retaliateon the orders of higher N.A.T.C. authority. &quot; *J2. All the military representatives, except the Canadian, have approved thisdirective.   The views of the Canadian Government, which have beenrepresented to the Foreign Office, are: -(i) That a directive to General Ridgway at the present time, ^^^Jenvisaging the use of chemical warfare in retaliation, might leakand so provide fuel for Soviet propaganda.(ii) That the directive should make clear that the decision toretaliate in the event of enemy employment of chemical warfare ^^^Hshould be a Governmental one; the phrase &quot;on the orders of higher ^^^1N.A.T.O. authority&quot; is, in their opinion, too vague.3. The Chiefs of Staff consider that, on military grounds, the Standing ^^^JGroup should be authorised to issue the directive in order that General-1-
VAVJ Ridgway can implement Allied policy.   They recognise that this mayBVfl involve the accumulation of stocks of chemical warfare weapons, but these yamI would be held by national forces and made available for use by GeneralVfVj Ridgway when required and when authorised by &quot;higher N.A.T.O. authority&quot;.?Wfl In this way a measure of national control over the stocks would remain*1(1       4.      Moreover, the Chiefs of Staff consider that the proposed directiveI to General Ridgway is in line with the Defence Committee decision on 9th July,thatVAVj &quot;The Allies should not take up a position which would deprivethem of their ability to use chemical and bacteriologicalH warfare in retaliation, if this were to their advantage&quot;, RVfland that the authorisation to stock chemical weapons is a necessaryconsequence of this decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. VfVJVAVj 5.      The following further points are relevant to the two Canadian objections:- VfVj(i)   As regards the fear of leakage, our emergency planningcannot be based on the assumption that messages from the ftwflI m Standing Group to General Ridgway are liable to leak* AllVAVJ  Wm our most secret planning passes through this channel,BWfl and the request for a directive on chemical warfare hasalready passed up it in the reverse direction.I (ii) As regards the responsibility for authorising retaliation, it hasVAVJ now been made clear in the Military Representatives&apos; Committee V&amp;VJthat the authority responsible for taking such a decisionwould have to be a political one. To specify that the decision VAVJto retaliate must be approved by the N.A.T.G. CouncilI implies that this body will in fact be running the war, whilstVAVJ                                  reference to any other kind of Governmental approval wouldraise a major issue with the smaller N.A.T.O, Powers, Thephrase &quot;on the orders of higher N.A.T.O, authority&quot; exactlyfits the meaning which we wish to convey.IJ       6.      The Chiefs of Staff consider that Sir William Elliot should be? IW      instructed to support the issue of the directive.   I agree with their views.The Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations B^HII have been consulted.   The latter has intimated that he concurs with the viewsVfWJ               of the Chiefs of Staff, though he recognises that there is some force in the V^HCanadian contentions.   The Foreign Secretary is prepared to approve the BwHVAwJ          Jl  directive to General Ridgway, but only on the understanding that the phrase : &quot;on the orders of higher N.A.T.O. authority&quot; would, in fact, mean that theI ^ Commander could not act without the approval of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, ftVfJVfwJ 7.      The Foreign Secretary and I feel that you should endorse theseinstructions before we inform the Canadians and Sir William Elliot.   I am BAwflVaVJ sending a copy of this minute to the Foreign Secretary.^___z^^M
