v 1 m(TH]g)OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 33414TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETJUDGES&apos; salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerHere are my views on the method of giving any increase in the remuneration of the judges as proposed by the Lord Chancellor (C. (52) 321).The choice between a large salary increase or a smaller tax-free allowance is not so easy as paragraph 12 of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s memorandumsuggests.2. I do not question the special position of the judges or their need to maintain some state and dignity.   But we have to remember that a&quot;red robe&quot; judge on circuit already receives an untaxed allowance of 7.10s. a day to enable him to do this.   If we must nevertheless recognise the special position of the judges when not on circuit - and many of themnever go on circuit - I believe, for the reasons that follow, that we have no real alternative to doing so by improving their salaries themselves, though admit that the tax-free allowance has the great attraction that it would lookbetter because the amount would be much smaller.   At present rates oftaxation we should have to increase the judges&apos; salaries by some  2,000to give (to a judge with no income beyond his salary) the equivalent of a tax-free payment of  450.3. The judges are entitled by existing law, like all other salaryearners, to relief from tax in respect of expenses incurred &quot;wholly,exclusively and necessarily in the performance&quot; of their duties.   this gives them relief in respect of the upkeep of robes, a personal library, etc.But this relief is small, the maximum relief being tax on  110 a year.And we cannot, in my view, give them within the existing law either furtherrelief from tax on their present salaries or any material additional allowance which will not in many cases attract tax.   We could of coursegive them actual cash in respect of the expenses at present relieved fromtax;  but that would only improve their position by a quite trivial sum.I think it is likely that without legislation we could also give them an allowance of some hundreds of pounds to give them greater privacy oftravel, either by the use of taxis or to help them to provide themselves with a car.   But in all those cases - which might be numerous - inwhich the judges used neither taxis nor a car of their own in connectionwith their duties, we should be in difficulty in justifying the charge of suchan allowance to Votes, and, more important, the Inland Revenue would be ingreat difficulty in exempting it from tax.   For the judges are the lastpeople for whom we should connive at a lax or dubious application of thelaw.   In a proportion of cases therefore - eVen if we risked theParliamentary difficulty - we should have failed in our object of givingsubstantial additional resources to the judges.COPY NO.   (xj
4. This leaves us only one method of materially improving theposition of all the judges by a means other than a plain increase in salary.That method would be a specific change in the law which would either give them an added payment which was specifically exempted from tax, or aspecial exemption for a part of their existing salaries beyond theirpresent expenses allowance.   To do this would I believe be a mistake.It would mean that their income would be treated in a quite different way from that of all the rest of the community.   They alone would have twosorts of income:  one subject to tax, the other not.   The necessary legis-lation would have to provide quite expressly that the ordinary income taxlaw did not apply to a specified part of their income;  for we should not, bydescribing any additional payment in the legislation as &quot;an allowance for expenses&quot;, confer on it any automatic exemption from tax within thepresent law.5. The consequences of giving the judges the privilege cf havingpart of their income exempt from the ordinary income tax law might be very far-reaching.   I am assuming that we are dealing with the 77 men who areJudges of the High Court or are of parallel or higher status.   I recognise thatthese men have a special position in the community.   But I have no confidence that once the quite unique privilege of exemption from the universal income tax law had been conferred on anyonej we should be ableto stop at that for long.   The discrimination in this matter between themand the lower judiciary and other semi-judicial officers might soon become abone of contention.   And other public figures of high status - includingMinisters themselves - could present a strong case for a similarexemption.   I have been under strong pressure to exempt from tax the over-time pay of miners and other key workers.   Once we break theprinciple that all, without any exception, are subject to the general law wehave started on a very dangerous process.   I urge my colleagues most stronglynot to make this exception.6. To sum up:  Income tax exemptions are intended to covertypes of expenditure which a man has to incur wholly, exclusively, andnecessarily in pursuance of his duties.   So far as the judges are concernedthere are no expenses which can be so defined other than those alreadyallowed, with the possible exception of a concession on transport.The real trouble about the judges is that their total net salary is too small.   The proper way to deal with this (failing a general reduction of income tax) is not to give an exemption from income tax on a proportionof their official income, but to put up their gross remuneration.   Or to put it in another way, although the judges occupy a special position, that special position is not reflected in their having to incur specific items ofexpenditure which can properly be freed from tax:   it is rather that their special position justifies a larger net total reward than they now receive,R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,,14TH OCTOBER, 1952.
