1 ^(TH,is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S- GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 342 COPY NoCC&quot;17TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTHE PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGSMemorandum by the Minister of Works -The Home Affairs Committee at its meeting on 16th October(H.A.(52) 27th Meeting, Minute 5) approved a proposal that I should introduce a short Bill next session giving powers to the Minister of Works to make grants for the preservation of historic buildings.   The Committee considered that a reference to the Bill in the Queen&apos;s Speech on the opening of Parliament wouldgive general satisfaction.2. The public has long recognised and is now keenly anxious that theGovernment should follow up the recommendations of the Committee under theChairmanship of Sir Ernest Gowers who were appointed by Sir Stafford Crippsto consider how the owners of outstanding houses of historic importance shouldbe helped to keep the buildings in a proper condition.   Two main questions were considered by the Gowers Committee:-(a) the form in which assistance should be given, and(b) how the Act should be administered.The Home Affairs Committee supported the view of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, which I share, that assistance should not be by way of taxremissions.   The Committee preferred grants to be made from the annualsum of  250,000 to  300,000 which the Chancellor is prepared to make available for maintenance.   In addition the Chancellor has agreed that the LandFund should be used for purchases up to a total of  500,000 in the next five years.We do not want to set up a new and expensive machine to handlethis comparatively small sum of money.   The Committee approved my proposal that our Bill should give the Ministry of Works power either to make a grantitself to a building or to make a grant to the National Trust in England and wales to act on its behalf.   I propose as a general principle that the Ministry of works should look after those houses for which no private occupier can be found,e. g. houses that become museums or are occupied by some Government Depart-ment, and that the National Trust should act in respect of privately inhabitedhouses.3. The Bill would provide for an.Advisory Council which would designatethe houses of outstanding importance.   Any house on this list would be eligiblefor a grant.   The arrangements made would in all cases be voluntary, and nocompulsory powers would be needed.4. This scheme applies to England and Wales:  I am discussing arrangementsfor Scotland with the Secretary of State.5, The Treasury have indicated that they would be prepared to extend the provision which permits buildings to be taken in place of death duties to cover
f:the contents of houses.   In this way it is hoped to help owners to leave tothe nation both an historic building and chattels which greatly add to itspublic interest.6. There are certain powers of listing buildings with artistic or historicimportance exercised under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947,by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.   These powers overlap those exercised by the Ministry of Worksunder the Ancient Monuments Act.   It is thought that an attempt to tidy up this position in the Bill next session would make the measure controversial and take up too much time.   I shall discuss with the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and Secretary of State for Scotland how, without legislation,we can improve our administrative arrangements.7. I therefore   ask   my colleagues to approve a short Bill which will(a) extend the powers of the Minister of Works so as to enable him tomake grants for inhabited buildings;(b) empower the Minister of Works to make purchases out of the LandFund up to a total of  500,000 in the next five years;(c) set up an Advisory Council to designate the buildings to which grants should be given;(d) allow the Treasury to accept in approved cases chattels in placeof death duties.D.E.Ministry of Works, S. E, 1,,17TH OCTOBER, 1952.
