Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 8C. (52) 30825th September, 1952CABINETTHE sudan memorandum by the Minister of state in a despatch dated 8th May the Governor-General of the Sudan submittedto Her Majesty&apos;s Government and to the Egyptian Government the draft of a newConstitution for the Sudan. Under the existing arrangements, this draft can bepromulgated as an order by the Governor-General if, within six months of the dateof the despatch, both Governments have not expressed their disapproval of it.2. It has of course always been our intention that the Statute should comeinto force, and our hope, as the Foreign Secretary told the House of Commonslast November, that it should be working by the end of 1952. Under present arrangements this could be achieved by merely saying nothing: but to let theConstitution come into force by default would leave the way open for suggestions that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were not positively interested in the programmeof constitutional advancement. Further, to do this, or alternatively to give ourapproval without discussion with the Egyptians, would lay us open to the chargein Egypt and elsewhere of having pushed the Constitution through without con-sideration for the Egyptian interest in the Sudan or the need to seek agreementwith Egypt. It would, in fact, be much more satisfactory for our general relationswith Egypt and for the future of the Sudan if agreement could be reached with egypt about the introduction of the Constitution.3. Since the breakdown last May of discussions with Hilali&apos;s government about a formula to serve as a basis for discussions on the Sudan, there have been no contacts between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Governmenton this subject. The various Egyptian Governments have, however, held abortivediscussions with representatives of Sayed Abdel Rahman el Mahdi Pasha (theprincipal supporter of the Umma Party in the Sudan) in an attempt to reach agreement.4. The six months&apos; period will end on 8th. November. Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo has therefore, on instructions, spoken to General Neguib,the Egyptian Prime Minister, about the Sudan. He has informed him that her majesty&apos;s Government intend early in October to send a despatch to the Governor-General giving Her Majesty&apos;s Governments approval to the draft Constitution.At the same time he has informed him that certain amendments, designed to meetEgyptian objections, have been inserted into the text of the Constitution, and thatHer Majesty&apos;s Governments despatch to the Governor-General will include certain conditions attaching to Her Majesty&apos;s Governments approval, which are againdesigned to meet Egyptian objections. He has also suggested that the egyptian government should join in an International Commission, consisting of British,Egyptian and Sudanese representatives with a Chairman who would be a nationalof a country not directly interested in the Sudan, to supervise the elections whichwill follow the introduction of the Constitution.5. The idea of a Tripartite Commission is not a new one. In Foreign Officedespatch of 20th February defining the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on lines approved by the Cabinet, Sir Ralph Stevenson was given authority &quot; at theappropriate time to suggest that a Commission, upon whch the United Kingdom,42953
Egypt and the Sudan would be represented, should be set up in the Sudan to observe the conduct of the elections to the Sudanese Parliament&quot; (last sentence ofparagraph 11).6. General Neguib has replied to the Ambassador^ approach that he mustconsult his Government, but will let us have their answer by 1st October at thelatest. If the Egyptian Government show readiness to co-operate, but expressapprehension about committing themselves without any agreement on the pro-tection of Egyptian interests after the introduction of the Constitution, her majesty&apos;s Ambassador has authority to say that Her Majesty&apos;s Government hopethat it would be possible to agree on some machinery for associating Egypt withthem in ordering Sudanese affairs between the coming into force of the constitution and the exercise of self-determination by the Sudanese, and to hint that, forexample, the International Commission might remain in being after the elections asan advisory body on constitutional development.7. If the Egyptian Government accept the proposals they might say thatthere is no time between now and November to appoint and bring into operation the proposed Commission. In this case, Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador will say thatit might be possible to suggest the postponement of the elections for a period of afew weeks in order to give more time, but that such postponement will only bepossible if the Egyptian Government have agreed to co-operate on the Commissionand are ready to make public their agreement.8. If, as is perhaps more likely, these proposals do not appeal to the egyptian government, and they ask for a postponement in the introduction of the Consti-tution until agreement can be reached on the whole subject of the Sudan&apos;s future,they will be informed that, with Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs blessing, the sudan government will have to proceed without their co-operation.9. Once the hurdles of bringing the Constitution into force and holdingelections have been passed, it should be possible to bring the Sudanese Government,which will by then have been,established, into discussions between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Egyptian Government about the Sudan. The SudaneseGovernment will also be able to express the Sudanese view on the speed and formof the next steps in constitutional development towards self-determination.10. The despatch of instructions to Sir Ralph Stevenson, which sets out more fully the considerations summarised above, is being distributed separately to mycolleagues.S.
