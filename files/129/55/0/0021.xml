Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No.67C. (52) 3213rd October, 1952CABINETJUDGES&apos; salaries memorandum by the Lord chancellor cannot any longer delay bringing before my colleagues the question of the salaries of Judges of the High Court. It is a question which has caused me increasinganxiety during the past year and I have refrained from bringing it up before only because I hoped from month to month that a more auspicious occasion might arise.Such a hope has proved, and is likely to prove, illusory. For, unless it is recognisedthat there are special reasons for an increase in the net emoluments of the Judgeswhich do not apply to any other section of the wage-earning community, the pleawill continue to be urged that a salary of  5,000 a year should not be increased solong as an extra  2 a week is denied to the engineer, an extra  .1 10s. a week tothe miner and so on. And the longer recognition is deferred, the more difficult itwill become. The more auspicious occasion will never arise.2. I therefore now put my case for an immediate and substantial increasein the net remuneration of Judges, for I am convinced that, if we do nothing, west and in real danger of causing irreparable damage to the judicial fabric andconsequently to one of the pillars of our Constitution.3. I need not elaborate upon the position occupied by the Judges in ourConstitution. Since the Act of Settlement their independence has been as the arkof the covenant. If they have not all reached the same high intellectual standard,yet for more than two centuries theirs has been a record of fearless integrity of which-T;heir fellow citizens, if they happen to think of it, are proud. Nor need I enlargeon the special qualities which should be possessed by Her Majesty&apos;s Judges. Itmay be sufficient to point out how serious and notorious is any departure fromtraditional excellence.4. These considerations were in the material sphere recognised by the wisdom of our ancestors. I set out in the Annex some details of judicial salaries whichmay interest my colleagues. I now only point out that as long ago as 1832 the salary of the judicial office which corresponds with that of the High Court judge of to-day was fixed at  5,000 a year. At that figure it has remained ever since.Thus the the financial position of a judge was in 1832 made secure andcommensurate with the importance of the duty which he performed.5. What is the position to-day? The relation in which a Judge receiving 5,000 a year in 1832 stood to his fellow citizens may have unduly emphasised the majesty of the law. In the year 1952, travelling in an omnibus along the Strandto the Royal Courts of Justice and perhaps hanging to a strap while the litigantand solicitor^ clerk occupy the seats in front of him, he enjoys neither the materialcomfort nor the prestige to which his position entitle him. This example (whichis not fictitious) I give as symptomatic of the change that has taken place. I want to impress on my colleagues its seriousness. I have now had the friendship oracquaintances of a generation of Judges. They are to-day gravely dissatisfiedand there is something like real unrest on the Bench. They see their positionsteadily deteriorating and always they are told that the time is not yet.43004
6. There have been prophetic warnings in the past that this state of affairsmight ultimately come about. Lord Birkenhead, writing in 1922, drew attention,to the difficulties with which he thought the Lord Chancellor would be faced in\filling vacancies on the Bench if no steps were taken to increase judicial salaries,and went on to say: &quot; Indeed there are not wanting signs that we may even be faced by the possibility that those already on the Bench, still in possession of their full health and vigour, may be indisposed longer to serve for an income which bearsno relation to that which they might earn if they were free, and may consider thequestion of returning to practise at the Bar. If either of these two things happened,-there would be grave reflection upon the prestige of the Bench, and a serious blowwould be struck at the whole of our system of judicature.&quot;7. Twelve years later Lord Sankey uttered a similar warning in the Houseof Lords. After discussing the qualities necessary for appointment to the Bench,he said: &quot;There cannot be expected to be found at the Bar at any given momentan unlimited supply of men of the right age, of the right experience, and possessingthe other qualities which I have enumerated. The position is not rendered easierby the financial circumstances of the present time. Most men at the Bar who come within the circle from which selection can be made are patriotic and willing, even at a financial sacrifice, to undertake the high calling of a Judge. But one cannotput out of one&apos;s mind the disproportion which now exists between the salary of a judge and the income which may be earned by a King&apos;s Counsel in large, or evenin moderately large, practice.&quot;8. I shall not, I think, be guilty of any breach of confidence (particularly as anincorrect version of the facts appeared in the Press) if I report that two High court judges recently came to see me to discuss their position. They were seriouslyconsidering resignation with a view to resuming practice at the Bar. I vigorouslydissuaded them, for it appeared to me that&apos;such a step, though it might be effective in calling public attention to the inadequacy of the judicial salary, would otherwise be deplorable. I was for the time being successful, but I am powerless to stop it if they change their minds again or others determine to take the same step. If such things happen or may happen, there must be grave risk that the quality of the Benchwill not be maintained.9. Yet that quality must be maintained. Never, I think, was it so important that it should be maintained. We no longer talk of the &quot; separation of powers &quot; asthe basic principle of our Constitution. But it remains essentially true tha.t a balance.must be preserved between the executive and judicial authority. To-day,when there is seen a vast increase in the power of the executive, due largely to the increasing body of delegated legislation, it is of paramount importance that judicialauthority should not be weakened. I would say that never since Stuart times was it so important that the Bench should be vigilant,, fearless and strong.. Can we be certain of retaining this quality if we do not accord to a Judge the remunerationwhich will at the same time relieve him of financial care and make clear to theworld that he has duties and responsibilities which place him apart from hisfellows? Perhaps I write pompously on this theme. If so, I ask forgiveness, recall-ing that I was myself for a long time a Judge and learned something of the isolatedresponsibility which that office brings.10. I may be met once more by the argument that now is not the time. I am sure, that, if we. delay in the hope of better days, nothing will be done by a succeedingGovernment of a different hue. For such action clear thinking and courage are needed,, and, being as a lawyer prone to Judge by precedent, I see no reason to suppose they will be found in a Socialist Government..11. Finally, I recur to a point to which I referred at the opening of this memo-randum. The sum which my plea involves, is trifling in: relation to our national expenditure.. It would not he. suggested that by itself such an addition could have any inflationary: effect. But always the fear is expressed that it will have its reper-cussions in the whole community and that it will be more difficult to resist, theclaims of every wage-earner to an increase of his wages. I would not deny thatthere, may be some who wiil take advantage of this as of every other opportunity topreach their horrid egalitarianism. But this should not deter a conservative government at least from pursuing a course which they think to be right, and,though it is no doubt easy for me to make light of a task which it will fall to others to perform, I should hope that the necessary legislation would pass through theHouse of Commons without serious opposition, and I believe that this would reflect
the general opinion of the electorate and would be but a blunt weapon in the handsjOf those who would use it to urge the claims of others, whether engineer or minerISr civil servant.12. If the principle of my plea is accepted, there will be no difficulty in determining the method of increased remuneration. Admit that the position of the judges is unique, then the fear so often expressed that the door will be open to others can be disregarded, whether the increase takes the form of a larger (a much larger) salary subject to tax or a tax-free allowance of  x in addition to the presentsalary. My own preference is on the whole for the latter. In either case legislation will be necessary.13. Although I have in this memorandum dealt only with the case of theEnglish Judges, my colleagues will be aware that similar considerations apply tothe Judges of Scotland and Northern Ireland, who find themselves in the samecondition as their English brethren.1. When the independence of the Judges was established by the Act of Settle-ment in 1688, the salary of a Judge of the superior courts was  1,000 a year togetherwith an appreciable income from fees taken from suitors in the courts. The income of the Chief Justices of the different courts was considerably more than this owingto the patronage which they enjoyed, which was particularly valuable in the caseof the Chief Justice of the King&apos;s Bench. The Judges&apos; salaries were raised in 1759by an Act which recited that the existing salaries were &quot; inadequate to the dignity and Importance of their Offices.&quot; The Judges&apos; salaries continued to be raisedthroughout the eighteenth century as the value of money fell and, at the end ofthe century, the salary of the Chief Justice of the King&apos;s Bench was  4,000, thoseof the Chief Justices of the two other common law courts  3,500 and of the puisneJudges  2,400, together with the income which the Judges received from fees andthe exercise of patronage.2. A series of statutes was passed in the first quarter of the nineteenth centurywith a view to abolishing the Judges&apos; dependence on fees. In 1825 the salaries ofthe Chief Justice of the King&apos;s Bench and the Master of the Rolls were fixed at 10,000 and  7,000 a year respectively, and those of the puisne Judges at  5,500a year. These salaries were to be in lieu of all income from fees and were expresslydeclared to be free of tax. A further statute passed in 1832 reduced the salaries of puisne Judges appointed after 16th November, 1828, to  5,000. The salary ofthe Chief Justice continued to be fixed at  10,000, but when Lord Denman wasappointed Chief Justice shortly after the passing of the Act of 1832 he agreed toaccept  8,000. By an Act of 1851 the salaries of the Chief Justice and the master of the Rolls were fixed at  8,000 and  6,000 respectively. Although these salarieswere still declared to be free from all taxes and deductions, this did not extend toincome tax, which had been reintroduced in 1842.3. When the old common law courts and the Court of Chancery were mergedin one Supreme Court of Judicature in 1873, the salaries of the Judges were fixed at the levels at which they then stood. The salaries of the Judges of the Court ofAppeal were to be, as they are to-day, the same as those of the High Court Judges,namely,  5,000 a year.4. Lord Selborne, who was the author of the Supreme Court of JudicatureAct, 1873, had intended that the new Court of Appeal created by that Act shouldreplace the House of Lords in its judicial capacity, but this proposal had to be abandoned in view of the opposition which it aroused. When, in 1876, the creationof Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was authorised, their salaries were fixed at  6,000a year, the figure at which they remain to-day.SIMONDS.Lord Chancellors Office,House of Lords, S.W.I,3rd October, 1952.ANNEX
