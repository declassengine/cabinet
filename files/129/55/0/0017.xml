Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1952SECRETCopy No.C. (52) 31730th September, 1952CABINETATOMIC  ENERGY  ORGANISATION: TRANSFER FROM MINISTRYOF SUPPLY TO A NATIONAL corporation in my view the time has now come for us to decide to transfer the whole ofthe Atomic Energy Organisation from the Civil Service to a nationally-ownedcorporation.2. During the war our atomic energy effort, which was mainly devoted tohelping the Americans in critical parts of their undertaking, was kept within asmall secret branch of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.When it became clear towards the end of the war that we would require a largeorganisation in this country in order to develop atomic energy, it was intended toset up a nationally-owned corporation for the purpose. This intention was notimplemented by the Labour Government which decided to entrust the wholeenterprise to the Ministry of Supply. The administrative-change was made in theautumn of 1945 and embodied in the Atomic Energy Act of November 1946.3. Seven years after the end of the war we have still to test our first atomicweapon. We hope to do this shortly but even then it will be some time before wehave a stock of weapons. The Russians, starting in 1945 with vastly less knowledgeof the problem or of the wartime American undertaking though unfortunatelypossessing more information than we then suspected tested their first weapon in1949, and certainly now have a not inconsiderable stock.4. This distressing comparison reflects no discredit on the many scientists,engineers and administrators who have done their utmost to build up our under-taking. It is partly no doubt a result of the ruthless priorities which are only possible in a dictatorship. But we could never have fallen so far behind if ourorganisation had been more equal to its task. The time we have lost is the sumof thousands of little delays all due to the application of Civil Service rules andconditions.5. The Conservative Party was at first reluctant to criticise the organisationadopted by the Labour Government. We wished to keep the project out of partystrife and we watched with hope and anxiety the great efforts of the first controller of Atomic Energy, Lord Portal of Hungerford, to overcome the many difficulties and frustrations with which he was confronted. But when Lord Portal resignedand when it became clear that our slow progress was leading to widespread dis-satisfaction, both among those engaged within the project and outside, I moved,on 5th July, 1951, in the House of Lords, &quot;That this House regrets the slow progress made in this country in developing atomic energy for peaceful and forwarlike purposes and calls upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, whilst maintainingbroad general control, to transfer work on this subject from the Ministry of supply to a special organisation more flexible than the normal Civil Service system underthe direct control of the head of the Government.&quot; This was an official party-motion and I had every reason to believe that it embodied a policy on which ourparty was resolved.Memorandum by the Paymaster GeneralHistory42991
6. Immediately on the formation of the present Government the PrimeMinister stated in the House of Commons that he was considering what adjust-ments should be made in the existing statutory responsibilities of the Minister ofSupply for atomic energy questions and referred to the possibility of an amendingAct (15th November, 1951). In the press of business which confronted the new government, and amid our preoccupations with the dangerous economic situationwhich we had inherited, it was at first difficult to devote sufficient attention tothis problem. In discussions between officials the proposal for a nationalcorporation was criticised, as might have been expected, by those who consideredthat no expenditure of Government money should be exempted from detailedTreasury control and by those who were afraid to make a big change at thisparticular time. Certain compromises were examined, including a proposal toset up a semi-Government agency on the lines of the Medical Research Council andalso, at the Prime Ministers direction, the possibility of a transfer to the Ministryof Defence. For one reason or another these proposals were all turned downand the Prime Minister announced on 24th March in the House of Commons that&quot; in view of the fact that important experiments are to be made in the autumn of this year &quot; no radical change would be made &quot; for the present.&quot;7. Subsequently, with misgiving, I accepted, within the existing organisation,the responsibilities placed upon me by C. (52) 119. My experience since then has confirmed my view that the existing organisation is unsatisfactory and that a cleanbreak is required.Defects of the Present Organisation8. The exploitation of atomic energy is the most important step taken byman in the mastery of nature since the discovery of fire. In civil life it offers us the prospect of supplementing, during the next few decades, our straitened coalresources. Less than 100 tons of uranium yearly may generate the whole of thenation&apos;s electricity. In the military sphere it will soon dwarf all other weapons and perhaps effect changes in international relations as great as those once wroughtby gunpowder in the political structure of Europe.9. Such an enterprise requires all the imagination and drive which we, asa nation, can furnish. It wants vision, elasticity and rapidity of decision: qualities of mind and outlook which we may hope to find in those who control large and growing industrial enterprises. We alone among the competing nations havechosen to put our atomic undertaking under the control of an ordinary Govern-ment department. We have subjected it to the same rules as the collection of customs; it has the same pattern inside the Ministry of Supply as have the royal ordnance Factories whose job is the routine production of standardised weapons..10. We have indeed made the worst possible choice. The Civil Service, forall its great merits, was never designed to handle work of this nature. Rapid pro-gress in matters of this sort can only be expected if the people in charge are given a reasonably free hand. It cannot be made if every decision is necessarily inhibitedby precedenfand bedevilled by consideration of parities throughout the whole range of the Government service. Full control by Treasury rules is essential to theordinary processes of departmental administration; it is fatal to the conduct.ofa high pressure industrial undertaking employing a host of wholly novel techniqueswhose development is in turn dependent on physical and chemical research beingcurrently pursued on the frontiers of knowledge.11. One of the most unfortunate results of Civil Service control is the rigidityof salaries and conditions of employment. There is little complaint to be made about the application of Civil Service salary levels to the great majority of employees, i.e.. up to the  1,000 to  1,200 a year class, though even here delaysoccur owing to the need to observe Civil Service Commission formalities in makingurgent if junior appointments. It is in the top levels that the main difficulties arise.Here it is frequently essential to fix a personal salary which will attract a particularman for whom industry may be competing. This is barred by Civil Service rules and a difference of a few hundred pounds a year results in a loss of momentumto the project which may cost hundreds of times as much. It has recently proved impossible to obtain a Deputy Controller in the Production Division, though hewas willing to come,at a salary less than he was receiving in industry. We have since looked in vain for an engineer with.his unique qualifications. A similarsituation may, at any time, arise in either the research or weapons branches; inneither of these branches has the Director an adequate deputy.
12.   Partly as a result of the level of salaries there is a frightening rate of lossQof key staff. In the vital weapons division, which is at the very heart of our national security, there is an annual loss which varies between 5 per cent, and 10 per cent.I have corresponded with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to find out whether hecould agree to any special forms of contract to improve this alarming situation; andI have been quite properly told that any action of this sort would be an embarrassingprecedent elsewhere in the Civil Service.13. Apart from this special aspect, the general security position is stillunsatisfactory. The safeguards rightly devised to protect Government staff as awhole are not appropriate in a special and vital project. The introduction of&quot; positive vetting,&quot; though it has apparently satisfied the Americans for a time,has led to little real improvement. Power is required to make suitable arrange-ments so that employees can be suspended or dismissed even though definite proof of misconduct is lacking. But this is quite rightly impossible while the project isin the Civil Service.   .The Organisation Proposed14. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the whole organisation should betaken right outside the Civil Service. I now therefore seek the agreement of mycolleagues to the setting up of a national corporation, which would take overall atomic research and production from the Ministry of Supply, together with thenecessary ancillary services. I contemplate that the corporation would have asmall executive Board. Members of the Board would be appointed by the PrimeMinister, who would answer for it in the House of Commons. The corporation would be financed by a grant-in-aid and its budget and investment programme would be settled annually in advance in consultation with the Treasury.Within its approved budget, and subject to directions which might at any time be given to it, the corporation would have complete freedom. Jealous as Parlia-ment has shown itself of proposals for grants-in-aid, I believe that an overwhelmingease could be made in public for this proposal.Timing of the Change of Organisation15. I believe that the critical time at which to decide upon, and announce, thechange of organisation will be shortly after the forthcoming test of the UnitedKingdom atomic weapon at Monte Bello. In the first place, as I have already mentioned, the Prime Ministers statement in the House of Commons on 24th Marchindicated that no change would be made until after the test. If nothing is saidthen, it would be held to imply that we had finally decided to continue the present arrangements.16. Secondly, the size, and to some extent the character, of the atomic energyproject is about to change. Its size will increase owing to the switch-over fromexperimental to production weapons, to the demands of the Chiefs of Staff forincreased output of fissile material, and to the new programme for industrial powerreactors. All these will mean that the present straitjacket will soon cramp the enterprise even worse than hitherto. - *17. The character of the project will be changed by increasing co-operationwith industry. Hitherto although, of course, industry has provided the organi-sation with a wide range of its requirements on sub-contract there has been littleconsultation with industry, and industry has borne no responsibility for any partof the work. This will soon have to be changed. It will not be long before thesheer size of the undertaking will probably force us to entrust some part of thedevelopment and management of nuclear plants to industry: in doing so we shall of course only be doing what the Americans have done for the greater part of their programme from the outset. But more particularly, as interest shifts from weaponsto power production, it is essential that industry should be brought in unless theGovernment wishes to seek to monopolise the production and distribution ofelectricity and perhaps of heat just because it happens to be generated by nuclearmachines. I foresee many obstacles to this most desirable development if the atomic project remains embedded in a Government department. The smoothtransfer and loan of individuals between the project and industry will be impededand the whole process of co-operation will be rendered unnecessarily stiff andvexatious. This is so important a feature of the problem before us that I believethat it should be stressed in public explanations of the reasons for the change.
Indeed, it may be found that this aspect of the matter would even appeal to theOpposition, whose hostility to a change such as I advocate has only developed inthe last year.Interim Proposals18. I realise, however, that even if the decision to make a change is reachedforthwith, it would hardly be possible to get a Bill establishing the Board through parliament until the .1953-54 Session and that this means that it will be at besttwo years before a Board can be established and the vesting date fixed. after careful consideration, I suggest therefore that a separate Ministry should be createdforthwith, by a short Act (or if possible by Order in Council), charged with theresponsibility of establishing an integrated enterprise which can be handed overto the future Board, of preparing the no doubt complex details of the permanent legislation required, and of carrying on the undertaking in the interval.19. I emphasise that this proposal for a separate Ministry is an interimproposal only. As I have been at pains to point out, my major objections areto Civil Service control as such and no mere shift of departmental managementwould provide a satisfactory alternative. Nevertheless, I see some immediateadvantages in having for a limited period a separate Ministry which would be ableto concentrate its attention on the needs of the atomic undertaking, free from thecountless other preoccupations of the Ministry of Supply, Quite apart from thegeneral issue, it is desirable that an independent Ministry should undertake theunscrambling of the project from the Ministry of Supply: a task which involvesseparating out those elements in the Ministry&apos;s &quot; common services &quot; which are engaged on work for the atomic project. Given goodwill I do not anticipate any great difficulty in doing this.Conclusion20. In conclusion, I would beg my colleagues to face the requirements of thedawning age of nuclear power. The present makeshift arrangement should notbe allowed to continue. We need an organisation such as I have described whichwould be able to use its unhampered initiative in the full development of its resources, which would be able to work in close co-operation with industry andwhich, incidentally, would certainly find it much easier to work with the similarlyconstituted American Atomic Energy Commission. If my proposals are accepted,I am convinced that we shall be able to make far quicker progress than heretoforeand regain the place in nuclear development to which the outstanding achievementsof our scientists entitle us. If these proposals are rejected, and the status quomaintained, the new Industrial and Military Revolutions will pass us by. Quietlyand imperceptibly we shall lose our place among the nations of the earth.C.Paymaster Generals Office, S.W.1,30th September, 1952.
