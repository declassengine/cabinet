secret.(52) 305 COPY NOv23rd September, 1952.CABINETTHE DECONTROL OF TEAMemorandum by the Minister of Food.-In my memorandum C. (52) 118 of 7th april I ms.de proposals for increasing the tea ration and adjusting retail tea prices in preparation for the ending of tea rationing.   These proposals were approved.by my colleagues(C.C.(52) 39th Conclusions, Minute 9).2. As a first step towards derationing, the weekly ration was increased on the 13th July, 1952, from 2 ozs. to 2f ozs.   On the 7th September the rationwas again increased from 2f ozs. to 3 ozs.   At the same time, blenders wereencouraged to increase stocks of packeted tea held at their depots throughoutthe United Kingdom and controls were modified to enable retailers and whole-wholesalers to build up stocks to meet any exceptional temporary demand whichmight follow the removal of rationing controls.3. Stocks of tea in the United Kingdom and afloat are ample to meetunrationed demand over the next few months, and world supplies should besufficient to enable importers to meet all our requirements after the initial period.   Any further delay in ending rationing might lead to restriction ofproduction, with the consequent risk of shortage in the latter part of 1953.4. The response of the blending and distributive trades to the call forstocking-up has been satisfactory.   I am satisfied that the risks of local shortages have now been reduced to a minimum and that the situation is likelyto deteriorate rather than improve by postponing action.   Evidence as to thepresent uptake of the 3 oz. ration is not conclusive but, from sales figuressupplied by the large multiple stores, consumption appears likely to fall below 3 ozs. once rationing is ended.5. I am satisfied that all necessary precautions have now been taken,and that the time is ripe to end rationing.   I propose to do so therefore on the5th October.   This information, which must, of course, be given at the lastpossible moment, will be released to the press in time for publication on the morning of that day, and for announcement in the Sunday morning news on theB.3.C.  I propose, at the same time, to remove price control and other controls on tea except those relating to the import of tea from the non^sterling area,which will have to be retained for balance of payments reasons.   I do not expect the removal of price control to result in any increase in prices which are nowtending downwards.6, I think my colleagues will be interested to have this advance information about the course I propose to adopt.Ministry of Food, S.W.1.23rd September, 1952.G.
