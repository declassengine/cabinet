(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL( rjC.(52) 333 COPY NO.I13th OCTOBER, 1952. ?CABINETPERSIANote by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs in connection with recent developments in Persia my colleagues maybe interested to read the attached text of a letter, dated 6th October, from her Majesty&apos;s Charge1 d&apos;Affaires at Teheran to the Foreign Office.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.13th October, 1952.LETTER DATED 6th OCTOBER FROVI HER MAJESTY&apos;S CHARGED&apos;AFFAIRES AT TEHERAN TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE.As you will have realised from my telegrams, the United states ambassador and I presented our respective messages to Musaddiq separately.Henderson felt that it would be exceeding his instructions if we were to havea joint interview with Musaddiq and in any case he considered that we shouldeach have a better opportunity of discussion if we were alone with Mlusaddiq.In view of the time factor I could not consult you and therefore acceptedHenderson&apos;s view.With reference to the last sentence of paragraph 4 of Washington telegram1883 of the 3rd October, I know for a certainty that it is not Henderson&apos;s viewthat if Musaddiq goes the change must necessarily be for the worse.   We bothfear that as things are it is only too likely that Musaddiq would be succeeded byKashani or a stooge of the latter, which would indeed be a change for the worse.   But we both still hope that some alternative prime minister may yet befound, possibly a Bushiri, a Zahidi or even a Makki, who might be more amenable to reason.   We both agree too that the longer Musaddiq stays in power thegreater will become the hold of the Tudeh Party on the country.   PerhapsAcheson was speaking strongly for the sake of argument.   But I am sure thathis views as expressed in the Washington telegram would not have the unqualifiedendorsement of the American Ambassador here.I am sorry that we had to abandon the detailed refutation contained in yourtelegram No. 4135 of the 2nd October to Washington.   In this case againHenderson told me that he could see no harm in our making known our legitimatepoint of view.   If matters are brought to a crisis and Musaddiq decided tobreak off diplomatic relations, I hope that we may yet be able to use the
refutation. I suggest that, mutatis mutandis, I might be allowed to issueit as a personal statement before leaving.In the twenty-four hours since the message was published there,has been no discernible reaction from the Persians,  As I have reported by telegram, moderate opinion considers that the door is stillopen.   But we are still waiting to hear from the extremists and I fear that anti-British agitation is inevitable.   If it becomes too strong,Musaddiq may find himself forced to make the break.
