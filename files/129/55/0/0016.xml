Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of top secret copy No. 6C. (52) 3163rd October, 1952CABINETTHE DEFENCE programme memorandum by the Minister of defence on 22nd July, 1952, I circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet (C. (52) 253)in which I set out the estimated expenditure over the next three financial yearsrequired to give effect to the policy set out in the Chiefs of Staff Review of defence policy and Global Strategy (D. (52) 26). On 23rd July, the Cabinet asked meto examine the effects of adopting lower figures both for annual expenditure andfor the load thrown by the rearmament programme on the metal-using industry(C.C. (52) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 5). In subsequent discussion with theChancellor of the Exchequer he and I agreed on certain alternative figures as abasis for this further examination, which has now been carried out. The results,with the comments of the Chiefs of Staff, have been circulated in D. (52) 41. the annex to that paper contains a careful and detailed analysis&apos; of the ways in whichthe programme devised to give effect to the Chiefs of Staffs Strategic Review wouldhave to be modified, if either of the alternative lower figures (Exercises I and II see Table I of the Report) had to be accepted. A defence programme is a highlycomplex affair and it is not easy from a study of a mass of detail to derive a clearpicture of the general effect of different levels of expenditure. I want in this paper to help my colleagues to realise clearly what is at stake, and to state my ownconclusions on the proper size of the programme for the next three years.2. In my previous memorandum (C. (52) 253) I drew the attention of theCabinet to the importance of the Chiefs of Staffs Review, which they completed inJuly of this year. For the first time since the beginning of the rearmament pro-gramme we had a full and careful assessment of our world-wide tasks and obliga-tions made in the light of the rapid development of atomic weapons and of theUnited States&apos; strategic air power, and taking account of the economic situation of the country. That Review and the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on british overseas Obligations (C. (52) 202), both of which were generally endorsed by theDefence Committee, set before us a coherent basis for our defence planning. TheChiefs of Staff, in their new report, once more emphasise that any marked departure from the programme worked out from their Strategic Review would be attended by unacceptable military risks. They point out that they did everything they could to confine their rearmament proposals within the limits imposed by economicnecessity. The resultant programme did not by any means build up completelyequipped forces in three or four years. Far from it. Re-equipment with new weapons under that programme would have reached a reasonably satisfactory levelby 1958, but much would have remained to be done even after that date inall three Services if they were to be fully prepared for war. This must be borne in mind in considering any further reduction of the programme.
3. Our defence plans have to cover the current needs of forces of a certainsize, the build-up of the forces where they are clearly insufficient, and a re-equip- fment programme for providing them with modern equipment where this is necessary,and for building up war reserves to a minimum level. With regard to the size of the forces and the build-up that is planned, the position is quite simple. no increase or decrease is planned in the size of the active Army, the whole of whichis committed in the Cold War, and only four of our reserve divisions are to -be equipped for war. There will be some decline in the active strength of the Navy,though it is intended to build up the number of anti-submarine craft and mine-sweepers the additional ships would be mainly in reserve in which ourdeficiencies are most serious, and to proceed with the modernisation of old ships to fit them for the conditions of modern warfare. The whole of the programme will be carried out at a slower pace than previously intended. The Royal Air force is to be expanded from its present dangerously low level in order to strengthen the defences of this country against air attack and to contribute to the deterrentforces of the Atlantic Alliance. The expansion is, however, much smaller thanthat to which we have been working since January 1951. Our contributions toN.A.T.O. will generally fall far below those which we accepted at Lisbon; this applies especially to bomber and tactical air forces.4. The main issue on the re-equipment programme is how rapidiy we should introduce modern equipment to replace the old, and how quickly we should buildup the small war reserves for which the new strategic concept calls. The pro-gramme recommended by the Chiefs of Staff already moves uncomfortably slowly.To reduce it much further would increase the danger that should war come theforces we should have to commit would be gravely underequipped and outmatchedby the enemy. If we are to have a rearmament programme at all, we must spendenough on it to make it effective; nothing would be more uneconomical than to spend considerable sums over many years without increasing the effectiveness ofour armed power.5. Given our strategic commitments, our obligations to our Allies, and our general tasks in the Cold War, our right course would be to accept the programme which the Chiefs of Staff have recommended. However, in assessing what is needed to carry out a given policy, there is room for argument about the precisecomposition of the programme, and about how far we should go in discountingthe possibility of war in the next three or four years. There &quot;is also room fordiscussion&apos; about the degree of obsolescence that can be accepted in some types of equipment.6. I have, therefore, in accordance with the policy which I have consistentlyfollowed since I took up office, and in full consciousness of our grave economic problems, felt it my duty to examine most carefully the programmes of the three services to see whether expenditure could be reduced without irreparable damage tothe main structure of the rearmament plan. In consultation with the service ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, I have personally scrutinised in detail the pro-gramme of each Service.7. The result has been to confirm the validity of the recommendations madeby the Chiefs of Staff and to demonstrate that they are not making any excessivedemands.8. I have, nevertheless, investigated certain further economies, which while they would be most undesirable and extremely painful, would not destroy thewhole basis of the programme, though they would materially set back our readiness for war.9. These further economies cover a wide range, but the following brief accountwill, I hope, serve to indicate their general nature. In the Army&apos;s programme, themain change would be a cut of more than three-quarters in the number of tankswith the 120-mm. gun to be delivered in the three-year period. This would severelyreduce the fighting power of our divisions on the Continent, but the number of tanksleft in the programme would be sufficient to keep the production line going atminimum level and to put enough tanks into the front line to act as a wholesomedeterrent. In the Royal Air Force, the completion of the build-up of the night fighterforce in Fighter Command would be delayed from the end of 1953 to the end of 1954;the creation of the mobile reserve of fighters would be slowed down; and expansionof Bomber Command planned to take place by the end of 1955 would be greatly
reduced. This would mean taking the Washingtons (B.29s) completely out ofservice. In the Navy, our own programme of minesweepers would be reduced by40, and the ships would be offered to the United States as an off-shore purchase for allocation to N.A.T.O. countries, so that they would still go to reduce the generaldeficiencies of minesweepers. For all three Services, the vehicle programmes wouldbe cut, the accumulation of war reserves of warlike stores in several importantcategories, as well as of general stores and clothing, would be delayed; all furtherstockpiling of oil fuel would cease, except for aviation fuels, our stocks of whichare far too low, and stocks would be run down to some extent. Further reductions would, be made in works programmes and staffs would be reduced wherever possible. The numbers of Z reservists called up for training would be substantiallycut, and there would be some reduction in the refresher training of reserve pilots.10. If all these economies were forced upon us, the saving during the threeyears would be about  250 million.11. I can summarise the position as follows. The original costing of theChiefs of Staff Review gave the following figures:  Total,1953-54-1952-53        1953-54        1954-55        1955-56        1955-56 M.  M.  M.  M.  M.1,462 1,759 1,857 1,867 5,483(actual)A revised and more accurate costing of the programme has since been worked out, making better allowances for shortfalls in production, giving the following figures:  Total,1953-54-1952-53        1953-54        1954-55        1955-56        1955^56 M.  M.  M.  M. .  M.1,462 1,719 1,777 1,790 5,286(actual)The figures that would result from the Chiefs of Staff Review, if the savingsmentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10 were made in full, would be:  Total,1953-54-1952-53     &apos;   1953-54        1954-55        1955-56        1955-56 M.  M.   :  M.  M.  M.1,462 1,645 1,688 1,698 5,031(actual)12. In comparing the figures of future expenditure with the provision forthe current year, it should be remembered that they include, as pointed out inparagraphs 5 and 6 of the Annex to D. (52) 41, substantial amounts for services for which either no provision, or much smaller provision, had to be made thisyear. In considering these amounts, the following factors should be borne inmind:  (a) GermanyIt has been assumed that from July 1953 the local costs of UnitedKingdom forces in Germany will be met in full by the United kingdom excequer. We have maintained that we cannot accept this additional burden on our balance of payments. The Americans are well aware ofthis. There is also likely to be some delay in raising the first german forces. Against this background I suggest that it would be reasonable to assume that our local costs after July 1953 will not have to be borne in full by the United Kingdom Exchequer, but that they will be offsetfrom Germany or from American aid in a substantial degree, whichI should estimate at possibly  30 million in 1953-54 and  35 million ineach of the two succeeding years. &apos;
(b) G.P.O. ChargesUnder a recent Cabinet ruling the cost of G.P.O. expenditure on defence account is now being recovered from defence votes, and thusforms part of the defence budget though not an additional charge on theExchequer.(c) Expenditure in MalayaAgain under a recent Cabinet ruling the extra cost of preservinginternal security in Malaya has been transferred from the Colonial and middle Eastern Services Vote to Defence Votes, with no extra charge tothe Exchequer.(d) Petrol DutyThe figures include about  40 million a year for petrol duty, whichreturns immediately to the Exchequer. This amount has been greatlyincreased, to the extent of no less than  35 million a year in comparisonwith previous years, by increased duty and because jet aircraft now usedutiable fuel.   Clearly this expenditure is no burden on the Exchequer.13.   The sums concerned in these four items are:  Germany ...G.P.O. ServicesMalaya    ...Petrol DutyFull allowance must be made for this additional burden on the defence budget in any comparison between current and future estimates^Metal-Using Industries14. If the further economies mentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10 above weremade in full, the load imposed on the metal-using industries by the defence pro-1953-54	1954-5	1955-56	Total M.	 M.	 M.

Metal-using pro-duction is, however, the heart and core of the rearmament programme and I anifuily satisfied:  (a) that, after making every effort, all possible economies in this sphere,which are consistent with the maintenance of the rearmament pro-gramme at an adequate level, have been made;(b) that to impose further reductions on the figures now suggested would create very serious risks;(c) that to impose a fiat level of metal-using production over the next threeyears at this stage of the rearmament programme is not practicablewithout destroying the whole basis of the programme and causing far more serious dislocation arid inefficiency than that with which we arealready faced.15; ( Iwouid ask my colleagues to bear in mind, too, that these calculations onmetal-using production, are not by any means precise arid that the whole mattermust be considered against the background of a total metal-using production inthe country of somewhere between  3,500 million and  4,000. million annually.  It
does not seem to me that for the sake of  30 million or  40 million annually weshould be justified in inflicting the serious damage to the rearmament programme which would result from further reductions of this kind.Investment Programmes16. The investment programmes (new works and building in the UnitedKingdom only) corresponding to the financial estimates under Global Strategyrequire  118 million in the calendar year 1953. The economies which I have mentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10 would reduce this figure slightly and generallyI am prepared to keep the 1953 programme within the limit of  114 million uponwhich the Cabinet agreed in principle at their meeting on 24th July (C.C. (52) 73rdConclusions, Minute 8). In the years 1954 and 1955 the figures fall to 102-5 million and  98-5 million respectively, a significant reduction which shouldbe of considerable assistance to the economy.Prices17. When I undertook my further study of the programme, I agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer that this should be in terms&apos;of real resources and not simply of money. All the figures in this memorandum and in D. (52) 41 are basedon the level of costs, prices and wages prevailing in June 1952 and no allowance has been made for any increases during the next three years. The programme would thus not be susceptible of reduction to offset rises in costs. Neither, ofcourse, could any reductions be made to accommodate any further items such asthose mentioned in paragraph 12 which it may be decided in future to transfer from other votes to defence votes.Conclusion18. It is essential for domestic and international reasons that a broad decisionon the size of our future defence programme should be reached as soon as possible,and that this decision should cover the next three years. We cannot delay any longer in deciding what figures we are to use for the N.A.T.O. Annual Review, our reply to which is already a month overdue. The further examination I have madehas confirmed my view that to carry out our agreed policy we need a defence budget of the size which I recommended in my earlier paper C. (52) 253 of22nd July, as adjusted in Table III of the Annex to D. (52) 41, i.e.,  5,286 million for the three years. If, however, our economic difficulties compel us to reduce all forms of Government expenditure and use of economic resources, I should beprepared, though with great reluctance, to make further economies in order tocome down to  5,031 million. I could not possibly recommend going any further than this. I recognise that we are living in times when risks must be run political,economic and military. But the balance of risk must be evenly borne. I could notsubscribe to a policy which, in a manner so familiar in the past, threw all the riskson to defence and the armed forces.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,3rd October, 1952.
