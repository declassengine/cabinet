Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 186 Copy No.    5 617th November, 1961CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of power on 26th October (C.C. (61) 58th Conclusions, Minute 5) I asked the Cabinetto approve the proposals of the National Coal Board for the following selectiveincreases in coal prices:(a) an increase averaging 14s. lOd. a ton (20s. on house coal and 15 per cent.on other coals) in the price of all Scottish coal as from 1st January, 1962;(b) an increase of 6s. a ton on coal sold in the North-Western Division fromthe same date;(c) an increase of 20s. a ton in the price of South Wales boiler fuels on1st May, 1962, in addition to the increase of 10s. a ton resulting from areclassification of groups on 1st November.2. Particular concern was expressed about the effect of the increase onScotland&apos;s economic prospects. The Cabinet recognised the need for measures to restore the National Coal Board&apos;s financial position, but asked me to considerthe problem further in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, theChief Secretary to the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andthe Minister without Portfolio and to submit revised proposals. Two meetingshave been held under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary.3. Before the first of these meetings, Lord Robens, the Chairman of theNational Coal Board, let me have a report prepared for the Board by Messrs.Cooper Brothers on the Board&apos;s financial prospects up to the end of 1966. Thisreport had been commissioned in connection with the target to be set to the industry under the White Paper on the Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337). It is based on a series of assumptions,which may well be optimistic, and suggests that the Board&apos;s prospects are evenmore serious than I described to the Cabinet on 26th October. It estimates that,without further price increases and allowing an additional  10 millions a year forfixed assets replacement in order to comply with the requirements of the white paper, the Board&apos;s deficit will be  47 millions in 1962 and  282 millions over thewhole five years. I have already begun with the Board an examination of thefuture of (the industry and of the measures that will be needed to secure its viability.My four colleagues and I felt that it might be convenient if I brought comprehensiveproposals before a group of Ministers (perhaps the Economic Policy Committee)as soon as I was in a position to do so.4, My colleagues agreed that the serious position now revealed makes it allthe more urgent for the Coal Board to secure additional revenue in order to dealwith their mounting deficit. Since the Cabinet discussion last month, the board have given me a comprehensive schedule of price increases which they want tointroduce before 1st May, 1962. This schedule is summarised in Annex A (i).Apart from the proposals for Scotland, the North Western Division, and for boiler59996BTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
fuels which the Cabinet have already seen, the most important proposal is toincrease, by 10s. a ton on 1st May, 1962, the price of all house coal and large coalused by industry in England and Wales (but not in Scotland). Even if the Board&apos;sproposals were accepted in full, they would only earn  33 millions more in 1962towards their estimated deficit of  47 millions in that year. The Board are considering the possibility of adding 2s. 6d. a ton to the cost of small coal used byelectricity power stations and general industry, in the autumn of 1962, as a furtherstep towards bridging this gap, but they are not ready to submit this proposalformally for my consideration.5. My colleagues and I considered several possible courses. We agreed thatit was undesirable in principle to seek legislative authority to subsidise either theCoal Board or individual consumers of coal. We thought that any question ofreorganising the Coal Board&apos;s capital structure, so as to relieve it of some of itspresent burden of depreciation and interest charges, must await the conclusion of a comprehensive examination of the industry&apos;s future prospects.6. Our discussions centred on the question whether the Coal Board shouldbe allowed to secure their increased revenue by selective price increases designedto take account of commercial considerations and of regional production costs;or whether that revenue should be secured by a general increase in the price ofall coal. We could not agree on this question of principle and we decided thatwe should bring it before the Cabinet for decision.7. At the first meeting we held, I was asked by my colleagues to put forwardrevised proposals, on the assumption that the Cabinet would accept the principleof differential price increases, but would want to lessen the severity of the coal board&apos;s own proposals, particularly in Scotland. The proposals which I felt i could persuade the Board to accept are summarised in Annex A (ii). Their effectsin various parts of the country are set out in Annex B. The main differences between them and those submitted by the Board are:(a) a reduction in the Scottish increase from an average of 14s. lOd a tonto 12s. 6d. a ton, the benefit to accrue entirely to industrial consumers;(b) the postponement of the proposed increase in the price of house coal andother large coal both in Scotland and in the North Western Divisionuntil 1st May, so as to avoid a mid-winter increase in the price of domestic fuel.These changes would reduce the additional revenue which the National coal board are seeking by  4-3 millions in 1962, and  2 millions in a full year. Toraise the  38 millions of additional revenue which my proposals would give theBoard in a full year, by means of a general price increase, would need an increase ofabout 4s. 6d. a torn on all coal.8. The Cabinet are already familiar with the arguments in favour of ageneral price increase, and of selective price increases.  To summarise briefly:In favour of a general increase is the burden which selective increases would tendto impose on those parts of the country, particularly Scotland, which areeconomically weakest, and where the Government are already taking special measures to support the economy. In favour of differential price increases :(a) a general price increase would still further weaken the ability of theeconomic coalfields to compete with oil and other fuels. The EastMidlands and Yorkshire are already losing markets and can no longerafford to subsidise losing Divisions such as Scotland and the North-Western;(b) the future of the industry depends largely on the Board&apos;s ability to closedown uneconomic capacity. Unless the price mechanism enables themto reduce the demand for coal in regions like Scotland, so that they canclose completely uneconomic pits, they can never hope to wipe out theirdeficit in those areas.(c) Lord Robens and his Board believe strongly that, while public opinion will accept differential price increases which can be shown to be part of a plan for closing high cost and expanding low cost production, the continuation of the series of general&apos;price increases which have takenplace since nationalisation would cause a disastrous loss of confidence in coal as a fuel.
Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,17th November, 1961.599969. I myself am strongly opposed to the principle of a general price increase and believe that selective increases should be large enough to contribute towardsthe Board&apos;s policy of closing down high-cost pits and maintaining the capacity ofthe most economic coalfields to compete with other fuels. At their discussion on26th October, the Cabinet seemed ready on balance to accept the principle ofdifferential price increases, based on variations in costs of production, but thought the increases then proposed were too severe. I hope that my modified proposals will be acceptable to the Cabinet. I believe they are the least we can expect theBoard to accept, consistently with our commitment to leave the nationalised industries as much freedom as possible in fixing their prices.10. I hope the Cabinet will allow me to tell the Coal Board that theGovernment accept the need for selective price increases but feel that the effectof the Board&apos;s proposals would be too serious, especially in Scotland. I wouldthen discuss with the Board a revision of their proposals along the lines summarised in Annex A (ii). I would be most grateful for a decision very soon. The board will have to revise their proposals in the light of the Cabinefs decision, and mustthen carry through the necessary consultations with the Domestic and the IndustrialConsumers&apos; Councils, in time to bring price increases on industrial coals into effect in Scotland and the North-Western Division on 1st January, 1962.R.
