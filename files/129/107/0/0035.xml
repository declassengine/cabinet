THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 185 Copy No.   5715th November, 1961CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN GREATER london memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet considered the future of London Government at their meetings on 6th July (C.C. (61) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6) and 20th July (C.C. (6.1) 41stConclusions, Minute 5).2. The general view was that, with two important qualifications, the broadlines of reorganisation proposed by the Royal Commission were acceptable. these were that the borough should become the primary unit of local government, andthat a directly-elected Greater London Council should be established to carry outthose functions which need to be planned and administered over the whole of the metropolis.3. Final decisions were deferred until the Cabinet could consider a draftof a White Paper. The attached draft has been prepared in consultation with theother Ministers immediately concerned.4. Size of the Boroughs. The Commission proposed 5.1 boroughs rangingin population from 100,000 to 250,000. The Cabinet thought they should be larger.Proposals have been worked out for 33 boroughs ranging from about 200,000 toabout 350,000. The White Paper has been drafted on this assumption.5. Education. The Commission^ proposal to divide responsibility for education between the Greater London Council and the boroughs was thoughtunacceptable.6. An alternative to this which was before the Cabinet on 20th July was asystem of joint boards. My predecessor disliked this solution. In effect we shouldbe saying that not a single directly-elected local authority in the whole of greater london, although larger under our proposals than the majority of county boroughs,was capable of administering this most important local government service. Thiswould be very difficult, and certain to arouse bitter opposition within localgovernment. I have discussed the question with the Minister of Education andparagraphs 9 and 3$ to 44 of the draft White Paper indicate our conclusions.7. We propose that, outside a central area, education should be a boroughresponsibility. This will greatly help to get local authority support, and shouldmake the proposals for bigger boroughs more acceptable. For a central area, theMinister of Education is convinced that there is need for a single education authority.The reasons are set out in the White Paper. This central area should, we think,cover several boroughs and have a population of perhaps 2 million, though the eventual size must depend to some extent on the possibility of finding an appropriategroup of boroughs.8. The form of the education authority for this central area presents some difficulty. There is no ideal solution. It might be constituted from those member selected to the Greater London Council for the area, thus preserving the principleof direct election. Alternatively it might take the form of a joint board. Although59982
I do not think the joint board system really satisfactory for a service like education,we ought to hear the views of the boroughs concerned before coming to a conclusion. Therefore I propose, in agreement with the Minister of Education, tocanvass these two possible solutions in the White Paper, and to reserve our decision until we have heard views.conclusion 9. it js essential that we should now announce our decisions, and I hopethat my colleagues will agree to immediate publication of the White Paper.10. Its proposals will be subject to consultation with the local authorities concerned and to debate. They can, if necessary, be modified before legislation is introduced. There are many relatively minor but still important matters to besettled. But we must get started. With the present uncertainty as to its future itis becoming increasingly difficult for local government in Greater London to carryon. If we are to legislate during the lifetime of the present Parliament and thatis what our party expects we must aim at a Bill in the 1962-63 session. Forthat we need to start the consultations at once.11. On the proposed borough pattern, and on the precise area to be included within Greater London, I suggest that I should announce the provisional proposalsfor 33 boroughs as soon as possible after publication of the White Paper, as a basis for discussion with the authorities. These proposals may well be subject to substantial modification as a result of discussion. These discussions will alsocover the precise definition of the central area for education, which will dependvery much on the borough pattern. The final pattern must be settled before aBill is introduced.12. The proposed reorganisation will effect a very great improvement inthe local government system of Greater London. It is in principle strongly supported by our party. If we do not legislate for it in the lifetime of this parliament we may well miss a great opportunity. Meanwhile local governmentin the capital, already quite incapable of dealing with the immense and growingproblems of traffic and of general congestion, will become increasingly chaotic.13.   I ask my colleagues to agree:(a) that I should now publish the White Paper;(b) that following the publication of the White Paper, the Ministers concerned should be authorised to start any necessary consultations with localauthorities and bodies who may be concerned with particular aspectsof the proposals; and(c) that preparation of a Bill, to be ready for the 1962-63 session, should beput in hand.C.

DRAFTLONDON GOVERNMENTGovernment Proposalsfor ReorganisationPresented by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to parliament by Command of Her Majesty1961LONDONHER MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office net cmnd.
LONDON GOVERNMENTGovernment Proposals for ReorganisationThe Royal commission. The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater london was set up in December, 1957 &quot; to examine the present system and working of local government in theGreater London area; to recommend whether any, and if so what,changes in the local government structure and the distribution of localauthority functions in the area, or in any part of it, would better secureeffective and convenient local government; and to regard, for these purposes, local government as not including the administration of police,or of water, and the Greater London area as comprising theMetropolitan Police District together with the City of London, the boroughs of Dartford, Romford and Watford, the Urban Districts ofCaterham and Warlingham, Chorley Wood, Hornchurch, Rickmans-worth, and Walton and Weybridge, and the Parish of Watford Ruralin the Watford Rural District.&quot;Their report was made in October, 1960 (Cmnd. 1164).2. After an exhaustive consideration of the administration of the mainlocal government services, and of the general functioning of local govern-ment in the areas, the Royal Commission summed up their conclusions in these words (paragraphs 695, 696) &quot; Where things are working well our inclination is to leave themalone. We do not believe that London&apos;s problems can be solved merely by improving the machinery of government. Our inclination is torecommend changes only where they appear to be essential.In spite of these predilections the facts we have found to exist andthe inferences we feel bound to draw from them drive us to the conclusionthat, judged by the twin tests of administrative efficiency and the health of representative government, the present structure of local governmentin the Review Area is inadequate and needs overhaul.&quot;3. The Commission^ criticisms of the present system fall under two main heads. First, they found that a number of vital functions notablytown planning, traffic, roads and overspill which at present are the concern of many different authorities, require a broader treatment than can be givento them under the present system. Second, they found that for a variety of reasons the status and responsibilities of boroughs and urban districts have seriously declined; and they expressed the belief that the health of localgovernment required the rehabilitation of these authorities.4. The Commission^ main recommendations, which were unanimous,may be summarised thus: (1) The conception of an upper and lower tier of authorities should bereplaced by the conception of the Greater London borough as the primary unit of local government, performing all functions which canbe performed within its own limited area; and a directly electedCouncil for Greater London as a unit of local government performing
functions which can only be or can better be performed over the wider area of Greater London.(2) The appropriate range of population for a Greater London boroughshould be 100,000 to 250,000 and, wherever practicable, existingboroughs and county districts should be retained or amalgamatedwithout change of boundaries.5. The Commission recommended that the principle to be followed inassigning functions was that those to be performed by each type of authority should be as far as possible self-contained without overlapping or duplication-tion. Their report contains detailed proposals for distributing functions.They considered that the boroughs&apos; responsibilities should include housing(the Greater London Council having some concurrent and supplementarypowers): personal health, welfare and children&apos;s services: environmentalhealth (other than refuse disposal): roads (other than main roads): andlibraries. They should also have an important part in the administrativedischarge of education and planning functions. The Council for greater london should be the education and planning authority (with somefunctions in these fields undertaken by the boroughs on lines to be laid downby statute), and the authority for traffic, main roads, refuse disposal, fire and ambulance services. They should also have concurrent or supple-mentary powers in respect of housing, parks, open spaces, entertainments,main sewerage and sewage disposal, and land drainage.6. The report suggests the broad lines on which amalgamation ofboroughs should take place, but the Commission made it clear that they hadtaken no evidence specifically on this, and that their recommendations wereprovisional (paragraphs 931, 932).Governments Main Conclusions7. The Government have carefully studied the Royal Commission^report, and the views of the 100 and more local authorities and others whohave commented on it.8. The Government^ main conclusion is that the Commission werejustified in their criticism of the present structure of local government in greater London, and that their broad design should be adopted as the basis for improving it. In particular the Government endorse the view that the boroughs ought to become the primary unit of local government; and thata new, directly elected, authority should be set up to administer functions which require to be dealt with over the whole of Greater London.9. This conclusion is subject to two important qualifications of theCommission^ plan. One is that the boroughs ought to be larger, and thereforefewer, than the Commission proposed. The other is that the structurerecommended by the Commission for education is not considered to be satisfactory. On education the Government do not agree that the two-tier system proposed would be likely to work well and they think that, given thelarger boroughs they envisage, education could and should, over the greaterpart of the area, become a borough service. In the heart of London, however,the Government consider that the best arrangement would be to have a largeeducation  authority  for  an  area   comprising  several  boroughs.    The59653
Governments conclusions on education are set out in more detail inparagraphs 38-44 below.10. Coming back to the broad design, the Government entirely agreewith the Commission that Greater London has a recognisable civic unity and shape, largely because it has grown outwards from a single centre. but its local government structure, inherited from the days when London was much smaller, in no way reflects that unity. The major services are administered by six county councils and three county borough councils, andthree systems of local government exist side by side: single-tier governmentin the county boroughs, two-tier government of the normal pattern outsidethe present administrative county of London, and a unique two-tier systemwithin the administrative county, in which most of the important localgovernment functions vest in the county council.11. London has clearly outgrown the system of local governmentdevised to meet the vastly different physical and social conditions of the last century. This great town now faces immense problems; problems above all of congestion, of traffic, of land shortages, of major redevelopment.All of its citizens are &quot; Londoners &quot;, not only those who live within theCity and the 28 metropolitan boroughs. Greater London is their city andall are involved in what happens to it.12. The Royal Commission were convinced that, unless some methodcould be found within the framework of local government to tackle the pressing problems of Greater London, the central Government wouldincreasingly supersede the local authorities. They thought that that wouldbe disastrous for local government, and they were right. That is the answer to those who say that a system of local government which recognisesGreater London as a unit for some purposes is not local government at all.In the Governments opinion it is the only way to enable Greater london to enjoy an adequate measure of responsible self-government.13. There is now an opportunity to carry out effective reorganisationwhich will bring London, government into harmony with the physicalfeatures of the metropolis, and will fit it to face the new problems presented by changing social conditions and the ubiquitous motor vehicle. TheGovernment are convinced that if this opportunity is not now grasped, localgovernment will wither in the capital city where, in the past, it has beenstrongest.14. The Government have been impressed by the wide recognition amongthe local authorities concerned of the need for some change. True, manywould adopt a different and less radical solution than that proposed by theCommission. But about the same number, while having reservation on some points of detail, would accept the Commission^ broad plan.15. The feature which attracted the greatest support was the conception of the borough as the primary unit of local government. The Governmentare sure that this is the right principle. It is a serious defect in the present organisation that many of the boroughs, and especially the metropolitanboroughs, have no real responsibility for the running of the local and personal services. The system proposed by the Commission would place personal,preventive and environmental health services, welfare and children&apos;s services,and housing, in the hands of one authority, local enough in character to
enable local knowledge of the area and of its living and working conditions to be brought to bear. This would not only greatly enlarge the scope of the borough councillor, but would also make for more effective administration ofthese closely linked social services. The Government regard this as a keyfeature of the Commission^ plan, and one well designed to attract into localgovernment more men and women of real ability, by making sure that thereare worthwhile jobs for them to do. If any re-organisation of localgovernment does not secure this it will fail of its purpose.16. The principal alternative plan is one, sponsored chiefly by the countycouncils of Essex, Kent, London, Middlesex and Surrey, for an indirectlyelected joint board for an area a good deal wider than that reviewed by theCommission, and the retention of the existing county and county borough councils. The board would have responsibilities in town planning fordrawing up a master plan to which the local planning authorities would berequired to conform, covering such regional questions as the main roadframework, target populations, the level and main disposition of employment:for laying down the main considerations for dealing with traffic: for planning and co-ordinating refuse disposal: and for planning and co-ordinatingprogrammes for over-spill. The powers of this joint board would be mainlyadvisory in character, and meanwhile somewhat greater powers would be conferred on or delegated to the boroughs.17. The Government are sure that a plan on these lines could not begin to meet the needs of the situation. For a start it ignores or denies one ofthe fundamental assumptions on which the Royal Commission^ Report was based: namely, that the built-up areas outside the County of London are,now, more properly a part of Greater London than of the Home Counties towhich historically they belong. But that apart, this plan would surely confuseresponsibilities. The authority which has to deal with the planning, traffic and road problems of Greater London must exercise a real responsibility, andmust be able to secure that its plans are effectively carried out. A largelyadvisory body, with powers mainly of co-ordination and supervision, wouldbe likely to achieve very little. The overall authority must be an executivebody if it is to be effective, although no doubt it would be right that it should in some matters act through the agency of the borough councils. TheGovernment also believe that this authority, for full effectiveness and bearing that mind the powers and responsibilities which it will carry, ought to be directly elected. A joint board as envisaged would entail a third tier of responsibility,and this would only further confuse the already confused local governmentpattern in the area. County councils would be sandwiched between the joint board and their boroughs and districts, while the latter could not be given the responsibilities which, in the Government^ view, they ought to have.18. The Government recognise that the abolition of the present countypattern in the London area will present formidable problems of organisationand the disturbance of some traditional loyalties. This is inherent in anyreorganisation of local government. They are, however, convinced thatLondon needs a form of organisation to match its present physical shape and state. They are convinced, too, that this organisation must be one whichrecognises the unity and cohesion of the area, and which would combineability to handle those issues that demand a comprehensive view of thewhole area with the capacity to grapple effectively with the local problems
now growing continuously in number and complexity. The government believe that, provided these conditions are met, as they are confident theywill be under the system now proposed, the new structure will itself providea focus for new loyalties, as well as fuller opportunities for really worthwhilelocal government service.The Boroughs19. The Royal Commission suggested that the boroughs should fall within the population range 100,000 to 250,000, and provisionally proposed a pattern comprising 52 new boroughs (including the City). The LocalGovernment Act, 1958, provides that, in so far as the constitution of a newcounty borough outside the metropolitan area is affected by considerations of population, the Minister should presume that a population of 100,000 is sufficient to support the discharge of the function of a county borough council. This does not mean, however, that larger units would not be betterif they could be set up without loss of convenience. Larger units wouldprovide more adequate case-loads in all the personal services, and so makespecialisation in staff and institutions more efficient and economical. Inaddition, larger units would be stronger in resources and so better able tosecure the major redevelopments which many boroughs now need, as wellas being better able to maintain and improve the standard of their services andto undertake their development as circumstances may require. Moreover thevery nature of London continuously built-up at high densities, with a comprehensive system of transport and a population which in many of itsdaily activities pays little regard to local boundaries distinguishes it fromthe typical county borough. Hitherto, London has suffered in its local administration from too great a proliferation of not very strong authorities.The aim now should be to create units which, while retaining their localcharacter, are as well equipped as possible to provide a fully adequatestandard of local services. In a closely-knit area such as London, theGovernment believe that this object can best be assured by aiming at a largerminimum population and rather fewer boroughs than suggested by theCommission. They consider that this will make not only for higher standards,but also for greater economy in the costs of administration.20. The Governments general conclusion about the size of the boroughsis that it would be desirable to aim at a minimum population of around200,000 wherever possible; some boroughs might of course be substantiallylarger than this. They propose very shortly to publish a suggested pattern of boroughs as a basis for consultation with the local authorities. In doing this they will seek, so far as possible, to amalgamate complete boroughs and county districts but there must be points at which boundary adjustmentsshould be made and not every existing area can be kept intact.21. The Government agree that the term &quot; metropolitan borough &quot; should now be abandoned; they propose the title of &quot; London Borough &quot;. TheCommission suggested that the constitution of the borough councils should follow that of municipal boroughs outside London, and the Government arein general agreement with this view.22. The Government agree with the Royal Commission in thinking thatthe boundaries and status of the City of London should remain unchanged,and that it should receive the additional powers given to boroughs in theLondon area.
The Greater London Council23. The Government agree, as already explained, that the Greater london council should be directly elected. They propose to adopt the Commission^plan that its members should serve for three years and retire together.24. The Commission proposed that election should be based on parliamentary constituencies. On the present structure this would give amembership of about 110. Many authorities have criticised this proposal, andargue that representation would better be based more directly on the boroughs.This is a matter which will require further examination in the light of the pattern of boroughs which emerges, and the Government reserve their decisionon it.25. The Government agree generally with the principles applied by theCommission in deciding which areas they should recommend for inclusion inthe Greater London administrative area, and they would not propose theinclusion in that area of any districts proposed to be left out by the RoyalCommission. When consultation takes place with the local authorities aboutthe borough pattern, there will be opportunity for any peripheral authority tomake known its views about its inclusion or exclusion from the London area.The districts left out of the London area will be brought within the ambit ofthe Local Government Commission, who will then of course be able toconsider, among other things, Watford&apos;s claims for county borough status.Functions26. The following paragraphs set out the Governmenfs broad proposals with regard to the administration of particular functions; many matters of detail will naturally require further consideration.Personal Health and Welfare Services and Children&apos;s Services27. There was no doubt in the Commission^ mind that these services(with the exception of the ambulance service, which is referred to in a laterparagraph) should all be organised on as local a basis as possible; they recommend that they should become a borough responsibility. TheGovernment agree with this conclusion, and concur also in the belief that positive advantages will follow from the concentration of responsibilityfor these services, and other associated ones such as housing and environmental health, in the hands of the same authorities.Housing28. The Government accept the Royal Commission^ main conclusionthat housing is essentially a borough service. They consider that newboroughs ranging upwards from around 200,000 population should be able to handle all aspects of their housing problems (including slum clearance) whichcan be solved within their own boundaries.29. The Government think, however, that it would be right to conferreserve housing powers on the Greater London Council. That body shouldbe solely responsible for arrangements for overspill outside the area. Theyshould be empowered to build within the area if and only if that is necessaryto help a borough unable to solve its own problems, or to secure development in accordance with the development plan.   The Council should not build
within the area except with the consent of the council of the borough inquestion, or of the Minister if the two councils are unable to agree.30. The Government concur in the Commission^ proposal that houses in Greater London at present owned by the London County Council shouldpass initially to the Greater London Council. They also consider a point nottouched on by the Royal Commission that in the first instance the housesowned by the London County Council outside Greater London would have tobe transferred to the new Council. But in time all these houses ought, in theGovernment&apos;s opinion, to be transferred to local ownership and management:either to the local authority in whose area they stand, or possibly to locallyestablished housing trusts;Town and Country Planning31. The Commission^ main proposals were that the Greater london council should be responsible for the preparation and periodic review of thedevelopment plan for the whole area, although (subject to some qualifications)the borough councils should be responsible for dealing with individualplanning applications. The Government agree that this general scheme ofworking is right.32. The need to have one plan for the whole of Greater London was thepoint on which there was the most complete agreement among the authoritiesin their comments on the Commission^ report, though (as mentioned inparagraph 16 above) the alternative proposals put forward by the countycouncils envisaged a master plan prepared by a joint planning board a set ofgeneral principles, within the framework of which the present planning authorities would prepare their own development plans. As already stated inparagraph 17, the Government do not believe that this proposal would proveeffective.It is true that the county councils who sponsored the joint board schemealso urged the need to look at a much wider area than that adopted in the RoyalCommission^ proposals; and it is true, too, that the influence of Londonspreads far beyond the continuous built-up area. There is however a clear distinction between the nature of the planning problems in the main built-up area which clearly must be looked at as an entity for planning purposes and those in the areas beyond. The two react on each other, but they canbe handled separately.33. A number of detailed matters connected with the part whichthe borough councils should play in planning, both in the build-up ofthe overall plan and in the handling of individual planning applications, need further consideration, and on these the Government have yet to reach final conclusions. In particular, further examination will be given to the proposition that it may be desirable to define special areas and within those areas to specify the kinds of development calling for reference to the overallauthority.34. The planning powers so far considered are those dealing withoverspill, the development plan and the control of land use. planning authorities also have powers to carry out comprehensive redevelopment,and that raises the question whether the Greater London Council should have
any function in this field. Clearly the borough councils can be left to dealwith most of such development entirely within their own boundaries certainly in so far as it is of a fairly normal character, such as the clearanceand fresh layout of obsolete development and minor improvement to theroad pattern. But where major schemes are concerned, entailing perhapsexceptionally heavy expenditure, on occasion traversing borough boundariesand usually involving major road improvements and affecting traffic conditions over a wide area, it may be necessary for the Greater london council to carry out the work. In the Governments view they should, have powers to do so, but (as in the case of housing) exercisable only withthe consent of the borough councils concerned or, if there is no agreement,of the Minister.* Traffic and Highways35. As with planning, there was widespread agreement that traffic management and the construction of main highways raised urgent problems which could be solved only in the context of Greater London as a whole.The essential recommendations of the Royal Commission in this field were that one authority should be responsible for traffic management throughoutGreater London, and that the same authority should be responsible for theconstruction, improvement, maintenance and lighting of all main roads.36. The Government accept both these recommendations in principle.A number of detailed matters will require consideration, especially thequestion of the complementary functions of borough councils, but in theGovernment^ view there is no doubt that ultimate responsibility for traffic management and main roads should be placed on the Greater london council.37. The Commission differentiate between &quot; main roads&quot; (by whichthey mean those chiefly used by through traffic) and other roads, and recommend that within Greater London this distinction should replace theexisting road classification. All main road work should then rank for grant.The Government intends to give further study to these proposals, and alsoto the extent to which main roads in the Greater London area should or should not be designated as trunk roads under the direct responsibility ofthe Minister of Transport.Education38. The proposal of the Royal Commission was that education functionsshould be divided between the Greater London Council and the boroughs.The Government appreciate the considerations which led the Commissionto this proposal: that it is most important to give to the London boroughsan effective role in education; but that to divide the whole metropolitan areaup into 50 or so self-contained units would result in a too fragmented&apos; system, especially in the heart of the area, where schools and institutionshave been provided without regard to borough boundaries, and where thefree movement of pupils across these boundaries has been one of the strengths of London&apos;s educational system.39. The Government do not feel able to accept the division of theservices between the two different types of authority. This is a system that can be made to work, but, as the Royal Commission themselves pointed out,
it has not always worked very satisfactorily, and the Government believe thatit would be wrong when reorganising the local government system in greater London deliberately to legislate for a divided responsibility in the educational field.40. As already indicated, the Government^ view is that there should be assigned to the boroughs services which can be effectively provided at thelocal level, and to the Greater London Council those functions which requireto be planned and co-ordinated over the whole built-up area. Followingthis principle, they are satisfied that it would be wrong to entrust to theGreater London Council the function of carrying out the whole education services for Greater London; the area is far too large to form a singleeducation unit. Moreover, their proposal to organise the area in larger andfewer boroughs than the Commission envisaged makes a big difference. TheGovernment believe that, given boroughs of the size they now propose, itwould be satisfactory that over the greater part of the area education should become a borough service.41. They do not think, however, that this would be right in the centre of London, where the absence of administrative boundaries and the consequent complete freedom of choice for pupils and students, is of specialvalue. Here they would wish to see one education authority for an areamuch larger than can be envisaged for the individual boroughs. they propose that for a central area covering about 2 million population thereshould be a single education authority.42. The precise definition of the area to be covered by the central london education authority depends very much on the pattern of the boroughs in the centre. The Government propose that this should be further considered in the course of the consultations about the borough structurereferred to in paragraph 20.43. The Government have considered what form the education authorityfor the central area might take. They think that the choice lies between a joint board of the boroughs in the area, or the constitution of a separateauthority from the members elected to the Greater London Council forelectoral divisions in the area. They would wish to have the views of thelocal authorities concerned before deciding which of these two forms to adopt.44. So far as higher education outside the universities is concerned, theMinister of Education has recently proposed that the colleges of advanced technology should bs transferred from the control of the local educationauthorities to direct grant status. The remaining arrangements for higher education will be subject to review in the light of any recommendations thatmay be made by the Committee on Higher Education under the chairmanship of Lord Robbins.Youth Employment Service45. The Government propose that the organisation of the youth employ-ment service should be on the same pattern. The central London educationauthority, and the boroughs in outer London, would provide the service unlessany of them opts not to do so, in which case it would be provided in that area by the Minister of Labour.
Environmental Health Services46. The Government agree with the Royal Commission^ conclusionthat, subject to certain exceptions, the environmental health services shouldbe the responsibility of the borough councils. In the Governments view there is a clear case for making the Greater London Council responsiblefor refuse disposal (as distinct from collection), and they agree with theCommission^ proposal on this point. Further thought needs to be given tothe extent of that Councils responsibility for main sewerage and sewage disposal, for land drainage and for certain major parks and open spaces.Ambulance Service47. The Government agree with the Commission^ recommendation that the Greater London Council should be responsible for the ambulanceservice; the area for the efficient operation of the ambulance service is verymuch larger than that appropriate to the other health and welfare services.Fire Service48. The Government also agree that this service can more effectivelybe organised over a wider area, and should be the responsibility of theGreater London Council.Other Services49. These are not mentioned individually in this paper and some of them will need to be discussed with the local authorities concerned before final conclusions can be reached. While the Government agree with the principle which animated the Commission^ approach, namely, that as many functions as possible should be performed as locally as possible, they also recognisethat there may be services other than those mentioned in this Paper which need to be exercised over or on behalf of the whole of Greater London.Intelligence Department50. The Commission recommended that the Greater London council should set up a first-class intelligence department for continuous research into the many interlinked problems of Greater London as a whole, a department which should serve not only the authority itself but also the borough councils, the central Government and the public. In the Govern-menfs view there is a clear need for such an intelligence department, andthey fully endorse the Commission^ proposal.Finance51. Obviously the financial implications of any reorganisation of localgovernment must be carefully considered. In the Governments view thefinancial arrangements should follow consequently on changes which arenecessary for other reasons. It would be premature at this stage to setout detailed proposals on finance. There are many factors which make areliable estimate of the financial consequences of reorganisation impossible at the present time. The probable effect on rate resources of the generalrevaluation for 1963 will not be known until 1962. The future cost of services when they fall to be carried out by altered or enlarged localauthorities cannot be very  closely  estimated.    For these reasons the
Government have not yet reached a final conclusion on the Commission^proposal that the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey should,for a limited period, be granted financial relief in respect of the severance of parts of those counties.52. The Government appreciate that the reorganisation proposed wouldinvolve considerable reduction in the resources of Surrey, Essex and Kent,but they see no reason to dissent from the Commission^ view that each ofthese counties would remain financially viable. Compensation for addedburdens resulting from boundary adjustments has caused considerabledifficulty and friction in the past, and the statutory provision for it wasrepealed by the Local Government Act, 1948. The Government would be reluctant to revive the principle of compensation for added burdens, though they will consider when further figures are available whether an exceptionshould be made for the counties affected by the reorganisation of LondonGovernment.53. The Commission noted that the average rate resources per headof population were higher in Greater London than in the rest of the country.But they recommend that a scheme of rate equalisation should be introduced to reduce the disparity between rates in the central area and those whichmay have to be levied by some of the other boroughs in Greater London.The Government agree that a scheme is needed. Further study will benecessary before the details can be settled.Future Steps54. The legislation required to give effect to these far-reaching proposals will of necessity be extremely complicated, and there are many matters whichwill need to be explored with the local authorities before legislative proposalscan be presented to Parliament.55. One important matter which will require early consideration is thegeographic pattern of the new boroughs. As mentioned in paragraph 20 theGovernment propose shortly to publish some provisional suggestions as abasis for consultations.56. This White Paper sets out the Governments broad intentions. Theyare proceeding now with a detailed study. It is not possible at this stage to say when a Bill giving effect to the proposals will be presented to Parliament,but the aim will be to make it possible for the new authorities to be electedin the autumn of 1964 and to take over from the existing authorities in April,1965. It is the Governments desire that the change over should be made atthe earliest practicable date, partly because it is very difficult for the existing authorities to carry on once it is known that changes are impending, and partlyalso because the Government believe that the changes proposed will provide,for this great city where more than 8 million people live, a more effective and a more firmly based system of local government, better fitted to meetthe needs of the future.Printed and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office59653   Wt.
