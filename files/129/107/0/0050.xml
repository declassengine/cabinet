SECRET\^\    &apos;    285(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.   kc^cabinet european LAUNCHER. DEVELOPMENTORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general in considering the proposals in C. (61) 197 we ought to bear in mind the financial implications.2.   Blue Streak was cancelled as a military project in April, I960.Ministers then agreed to consider whether its development should becompleted as a satellite launching vehicle.    The cost of the UnitedKingdom doing this alone was estimated to be  52 millions over fiveyears.3,     Partly in order to reduce the burden on United Kingdom resources,and partly in order to further European co-operation, we decided to explore the possibility of setting up a European organisation (E, L, D. O. )to do the job.     The cost of a European programme was estimated to be 70 millions over five years.4.     At the Strasbourg Conference in February,   19-61, the UnitedKingdom offered to contribute our approximate national incomeproportion, namely 25 per cent or  17.5 millions.    In the course ofthe Conference the Minister of Aviation, with his colleagues&apos;concurrence, raised this offer to 33f per cent or  23. 3 millions.5.     Five small countries whose contributions would have amountedto 10. 5 per cent are now likely to reject the proposals.    The remainder,including France and Germany, have indicated willingness to join,except Italy (9. 8 per cent or  7 millions).    Ministers have agreedthat, if the Italians accept, we should offer to share the remainingdeficit (10.5 per cent or  7.4 millions) with France and Germany.On this basis the United Kingdom would be bearing  26 millions.If the Italians do not come in, and if we were to bear the whole ofthe resulting deficit, this would make another  7 millions, totalling  33 millions.6.      This is not all.     The original estimate of  70 millions hasrecently increased to  74 millions.    In order to stick to the originalfigure for presentational purposes at the London Conference we agreed that the United Kingdom should bear another  0. 9 milliondepartmental expenses and  2.4 millions for expenditure duringC. (61) 20029thijgyember, 1961
the period from 1st April to 31st October which was to have been theresponsibility of E. L. D. O.7.      In order to bring the Australians along, we in effect offeredthem  5 millions just before the opening of the London ConferenceThey say this is not sufficient;  chey may well ask for  15 millions.8.      We have therefore progressively agreed that the United kingdom should bear amounts totalling  23. 8 millions over and above the 17. 5 millions which we originally offered at Strasbourg.    Wemay still be called on to pay a good deal more.9.      The cost of the E. L. D. G. programme is almost certainconsiderably to exceed the present estimate.     The United Kingdom/Australian element includes only some 20 per cent for contingencies;as originally calculated, the contingency element was 30 per cent.The Draft Convention provides for E. L. D. O. spending a further 2 millions in the first two years on research for subsequentprogrammes.     These, when reached, would be extremely expensive.10.    The prospect is much more attractive for the French (who willbe paying  16. 9 millions) and the Germans ( 15. 7 millions) than forus.     They will be developing the second and third stages of the launcherwhich technologically are now much more interesting than the first.11.     The figures given above are for development only.     TheEuropean Space Research Organisation may buy shots at some 3 millions to  4 millions a year, of which the United Kingdom would bear 25 per cent.    Having developed a launcher, we may well want to use it for our own national experiments.     These might cost some 10 millions to  15 millions a year, if the minimum annual production programme for the launcher were 10 to 12 rounds, a likelihoodreferred to by the Minister for Science.12.    So far not one country has confirmed to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that it is now ready to sign the Convention drafted at theLondon Conference, though there is reason to believe that the Frenchand Germans will do so.     The Germans have, however, proposed anumber of amendments, including one which would involve theUnited Kingdom continuing to bear the whole of the current expenditureon Blue Streak (about   jr million a month) for another month or two before E. L. D. O. takes over.    The Australians have indicated thatthey v/ill not be able to reply until their new Government have takenoffice.13.    There has been every indication that neither the French northe Germans are willing to get down to brass tacks about the short-fall in subscriptions until they know which countries are formallyready to join, and what the size of the deficit will be.    I suggest thatthis is only common prudence on their part, which the United kingdom should imitate.    Apart from anything else, we need to know whatSEGHIT
further price, if any, the Australians are going to demand for theiradherence.    Our financial resources are not unlimited, and we must recognise that the more we promise for Blue Streak, the less will beavailable for other purposes.14.    On the general issue, the total cost to the United Kingdom ofthis project would be not less than  4lmillioiic initially, if the Italiansstayed out and we bore the resulting deficit, plus perhaps  10 millions to 15 millions a year for production after the first five years, togetherwith the United Kingdom share of subsequent development programmes.If the Cabinet agree with my view that we should not at this stage makeany further offer, they may in the meantime like to be considering these questions in the light of my paper on Public Expenditure(C. (61) 199).H. B.Treasury Chambers, S, W. 1.29th November, 1961.-3-
