COFSEITIAL257[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MATESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 197COPY NO.28th November, 1961CABINETEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation memorandum by the Minister of aviation am anxious to press to a speed conclusion the setting up of theEuropean Launcher Development Organisation.   The facts are as follows:-(i) At th-3 Conference this month, a draft Convention was agraedbetween delegations and is being referred by them to their Governments.(ii) The technical proposals for the programme of launcher develop-ment had a satisfactory reception from the delegates and are also being submitted to Governments.(iii) Answers from the Governments concerned are awaited.   As ever,the   Italian Government are delaying matters.(iv) We have reliable information that the Americans are stepping upthe bidding in their offers to the Italians in an effort to coax the Italiansaway from Blue Streak in the belief that this would wreck the chances of Europe having an independent launcher.2.    I understand that President de Gaulle has expressed himself in support of the venture andthat he is willing that France should pay their original share of the cost plus   some further contribution to thetotal cost   but that he is not willing for France to pay any part of theItalian contribution.    It thus appears that President de Ga.ulle is pre-pared to go on with the project even without Italy   provided that someonepays the Italian contribution.3.    If I am to press this matter to a successful conclusion, I need a decision of the Cabinet that Britain should - in the event of Italydefecting, and for the first project only - carry the Italian share   onthe understanding that France and Germany will share with us anyother shortfall (as there are indications that they will be willing to do so).If I am so authorised,  I would communicate this forthwith to theauthorities in Bonn and Paris;  expressing the hope that they will cometo a speedy decision on the proposals placed before them.    This isthe only way left to us to force the Italian hand.4.    The difference between carrying one/third of the Italian shareand the whole of it is  900, 000 a year for five years.   I do not judgethat we should let our whole future role in this type of work founderupon a   sum of this size.    The total cost for  us including the Italianshare is  33 millions over five years compared with  55 millions ifwe did it alone.    The value of the work done on sterling account is 40 millions, of which  6. 8 millions would be spent in Australia.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
5.    We have made great efforts to secure these importanttechnological opportunities for the United Kingdom;   their loss nowv/ould be a grievous blow to our engineering industries and would present our principal competitors with a monopoly which they can scarcely fail to exploit.    I ask my colleagues to support me in thesefinal stages of getting a European launcher development established.F. T.Ministry of Aviation   W. C.2.28th November, 1961-2-COMFSDENT1AL
