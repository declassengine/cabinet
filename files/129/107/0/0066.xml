2 CONfMMFIALIMMUNITIES&quot; AND PRIVILEGES : FOR COMMONWEALTH.  ORGANISATIONSREPORT BY OFFICIALSWe were instructed to examine, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion on7thT March (C.C. (61) 11th Conclusions, Minute 8), the implications of a proposal by the Commonwealth Secretary that Commonwealth organisations&apos; established inthe United Kingdom should be made eligible for the benefits which may be conferred on international organisations by Order-in-Council under theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950.2. The Act of 1950 lays down maximum immunities and privileges, whichare broadly those accorded to foreign diplomatic missions. The most importantare immunity from legal proceedings, both civil and criminal; inviolability of premises; and exemption or relief from United Kingdom taxes. Benefits within these statutory maxima are accorded both to the organisations themselves andto the individual representatives and the organisations&apos; high officers.3. The primary purpose of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposal is toinvigorate existing Commonwealth organisations and encourage. the establishmentof new ones by offering them the same enhanced status and practical benefits as are now enjoyed by international organisations; and to use them as a means of developing a greater sense of cohesion and vitality throughout the Commonwealth.- 4. Its would be neither logical nor practical to extend immunities and privilegesto. organisations as such and not to their individual members and officers. Sofar as individuals are concerned, the proposal would at present have a real effecton very few people.. Apart from the prospective Chairman of the commonwealth economic Committee, the Director of the Commonwealth Education Liaison unit and a few others of less importance, all the members and officers of existing organisations either already enjoy diplomatic immunities and privileges by virtueof being, or being on the staff of, Commonwealth High Commissioners in london or they are outside the scope of the&quot; proposal because they are United kingdom citizens or Commonwealth citizens domiciled in this country. There is, however,pressure for immunity from United Kingdom income tax on behalf of the twopeople mentioned above, and it may well be that, as Commonwealth organisationsdevelop, an increasing number of individuals would be affected. Indeed, one ofthe objects of the proposed concession is to ensure that Commonwealth organisationsare able to attract staff of the right calibre from other Commonwealth countries.5. The arguments against extending diplomatic immunities and privileges aregenerally recognised:(i) It is inherently undesirable to put any body or person outside the law.Every time a new concession is made, there is a further encroachmenton the legal rights of our own citizens and the community as a whole.(ii) A further erosion of the principle of no differentiation in the incidence of income and other taxes,(hi) Every concession makes it more difficult to resist further demands. Whileit can be argued that the Commonwealth is a special case, the possible effect of extending immunities and privileges into a new field cannotbe ignored (paragraph 7).The strength of public feeling on the subject has often been demonstrated, mostrecently in debates in the House of Lords on 25th April and 3rd May.6. Some of the objections might be met, at least in part. It might be possibleto provide, as do some international agreements, that the organisation was undera duty to waive immunity from civil or criminal proceedings where this could bedone without prejudice to the purposes for which the immunity was accorded. Andit would go some way to meet the tax objection if the Commonwealth organisationswere willing, like some international organisations, to operate their own internalsystem of taxation (even if it applied only to a very small number of individuals).But both of these questions would require detailed discussion with other commonwealth Governments if the main proposal is accepted.
7. The nature of the Commonwealth is, however, such that it is not possibleto draw an exact analogy between Commonwealth organisations and the organisations on which immunities and privileges have been conferred under the1950 Act. If the proposed extension were made, a Commonwealth organisation would, we suggest, need to satisfy certain minimum qualifications before beingeligible for immunities and privileges: it should be an organisation on which boththe United Kingdom and one or more other Commonwealth countries (but noforeign countries) were represented; which was jointly financed by commonwealth governments; and which had a permanent independent staff of its own. Even so,there would be important differences:(i) So far as international organisations are concerned, if we are to enjoy theadvantages of membership, the grant of immunities and privileges is part of the price which we must normally pay. This does not applyto the Commonwealth organisations we have considered.(ii) The grant of immunities and privileges has been defended on the grounds that the organisations and their officers would otherwise be inhibited inthe full performance of their functions. It cannot be argued that theCommonwealth organisations and their officers have been so inhibited.(iii) The international organisations are, in all cases, set up by formalagreements. There is, therefore, an opportunity to limit the extensionof these benefits at the stage when the agreement is being negotiated;and, because they owe their existence to formal agreements betweensovereign States, the organisations are in form bodies to which it wouldappear logical to grant the complete immunity enjoyed by their members.Most Commonwealth organisations, on the other hand, are not basedon similar formal agreements: that is not how the Commonwealthusually works. There is not, therefore, the same scope for negotiations;the organisations themselves are of a much more informal character:and the logic of granting them immunity would not be apparent.These considerations suggest that the differences between the two types of organisations are sufficient to require strong arguments to justify the extension ofimmunities and privileges to Commonwealth organisations.8.   The main questions of policy for decision by Ministers are:(i) Whether the development of Commonwealth organisations and the recruitment of suitable staff for them would be significantly helped by the proposed concession or, conversely, inhibited by its refusal.(ii) Whether  the case for the  concession  is  strengthened  by  specialrepresentations received on behalf of two of the people who would be immediately affected (paragraph 4).(iii) If so, whether the advantages of giving an additional impetus to commonwealth organisations outweigh the recognised disadvantages of extending diplomatic immunities and privileges not only to more people but also into a new field (paragraphs 5 and 7).9. If Ministers decide in favour of the proposal, we recommend that further study should be given to the question of waiving immunity from suit and legalprocess and the possibility of Commonwealth organisations adopting their own internal tax systems.July 1961
