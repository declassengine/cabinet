DEC IM A; LjS ATIOIjDraft Statement by the Chancellor of the exchequer as I have already informed the House, the Government have been considering this question in the light of the widespread public interest which has been shown in it following the Joint Report of the committees of the Eritish Association and the Association of Eritish Chambers ofCommerce.2.      The Government&apos;s view is that real advantage would follow from adopting a decimal currency.    At the same time it is clear that,given the widespread use of accounting and other monetary machinery,the transitional cost would be substantial.    It should, however, bepossible to limit this cost, both by the choice of the size of the newunits to be adopted and by careful timing of the changeover.    before reaching a final decision, therefore, the Government consider thatthere should be a full scale investigation into the best form of decimal currency, the steps by which the change could be brought about, andthe cost of the changeover to the national economy..-I &quot;*C.
