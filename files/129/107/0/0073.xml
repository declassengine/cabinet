SECRETS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(6l) 175 COPY NO31st October, 1961CABINET3aBERLIN:  ECONOMIC COUNTER-MEASURESMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsMy colleagues will recall that I gave an account, following themeetings of Foreign Ministers in Paris and Washington, of measures whichmight be taken by the Allies should the East Germans or the Russians tryto interfere with access through the corridors to West Berlin (C.(6l) 132and C. (61) 149).   An ad hoc meeting of Ministers especially concerned withthis problem was also held on 10th October to consider a paper settingout the progress of planning,2. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N. A, T. O.) has beenworking for the past two months on a series of measures which could beapplied in different situations and in differing orders of severity. Agreat measure of agreement has been reached on the appropriate res-ponse to interference with allied aircraft in the corridors and a preciseprocedure has been laid down which General Norstad, the SupremeAllied Commander, Europe, should follow.3. N.A. T. O. also has under consideration a whole range ofmeasures from mild harassment of the   movement of Soviet personnelin N. A. T. O. countries to measures amounting to an embargo on tradewith the Soviet bloc in the case of complete blockage of access.   I attacha copy of telegram number 6059 to Washington giving the list ofmeasures that could be adopted (Annex A).4. There is as yet no agreement as to how economic measuresshould be put into force.   The Americans, French and Germans are infavour of applying them against the whole Soviet bloc.   We are arguingstrongly that in the beginning they should be aimed only at the DeutscheDemokratische Republik (D. D. R. ) because it is there that we should inflictthe maximum damage on the enemy&apos;s economy at the least relative harmto ourselves.   The debate in N.A. T. O. continues;  discussion on the lastpoint is only now about to be broached.   It is certain that we shall besubjected to increasing pressures by the Americans, but in the eventthe exact economic measures to be used will have to be decided in relationto the actual situations with which we are faced.    I am considering meansby which we can convince the Americans that unwillingness to prejudgesituations does not imply faintheartedness on our part.   I attach a copyof telegram number 7753 to Washington which tells the Americans plainlywhy we cannot agree to any particular economic measures being putinto effect automatically (Annex B).   I hope they will accept this explanation.-1-SECRET
SECRET5. So far there has been no trouble in the corridors, but in thelast week the situation has taken rather a different! turn and it couldbecome serious.   The East Germans have started to alter the practiceswhich have hitherto prevailed with regard to the rights of the Americancivilians to go into East Berlin without showing documents.   This is notdenial of access but a demand to see documents which have hitherto nothad to be shown.   For some years now British practice has differed fromAmerican practice.   Cur civilians indicate that they are the holders ofdocuments if they are requested to do so by the East Germans, although theydo not have to identify themselves.   Cur military are authorised to dolikewise, but have in practice never been called upon to display their papers.6. Ther Americans reacted very strongly against the East Germanefforts to make them change their established practice.   But the EastGermans, backed by the Russians, seem to be insisting.   Since theAmericans do not wish a row to develop which will wreck the chances ofnegotiations on the main issues involved in the Berlin dispute, they aretrying now to find a way of backing out of the difficulty.   Their Ambassadorin Moscow, Mr. Thompson, has been instructed to see the Soviet ForeignMinister, Mr. Gromyko, and ptopose that the Americans will adopt ourprocedure on civilian documentation if the Russians will open up asimilar number of points of access to East Berlin to that which is open tothem when they wish to enter West Berlin.   They at present only provideone into East Berlin whereas there are still twelve open to them. Thissort of arrangement would save face.7. If Mr. Khrushchev wants to rub the Americans1 noses in thediiNt, Mr. Gromyko will reject this advance and keep the Americans onthis awkward hook.   But I believe that Mr. Khrushchev does want anegotiation and there is a reasonable chance that this matter will besettled by some such device as the above.8. If Mr. Thompson&apos;s meeting with Mr. Gromyko fails, thesituation could become dangerous, because the Americans may try toget their Allies to agree to a number of measures prepared against adifferent contingency (denial of access to West Berlin by the corridors),b*it which would seem politically appropriate to them in these new circum-stances.9. I cannot predict what measures the Americans might thinkappropriate to this situation, but those that they have had in mind in theevent of denial of access to East Berlin hitherto include preventing Sovietparticipation in international activities (e.g. Trade Fairs, Conferences, etc.and stopping Allied participation in Soviet organised activities. Theywould also probably demand far-reaching controls over the movementsof Soviet bloc citizens in the N. A. T. O. area;  this would involve diplomats,traders, tourists and cultural parties - both resident and visiting. Thiswould inevitably affect our trading arrangements with Soviet bloc countries,by preventing the inspection that is essentialtb the completion of contracts,though it would not necessarily bring trade to a halt.10. I have suggested to the Americans that honour would be served ifthe Allies agreed first to reduce the number of access points into WestBerlin to one or whatever number the Soviets keep open and secondly toasking Russian civilians to show passes when they go into West Berlin. Butthe Americans may not think this is enough, especially if they get abrusque brush off from Mr. Gromyko.-2-SECRET
SECRET11.        There is, however, another line that the Americans mightpursue, namely to assert their right of access without identification forcivilians, even to the point of forcibly removing barriers.   This is thepresent American plan, though it is in abeyance during Mr. Thompson&apos;sattempt to reach a compromise with Mr. Gromyko.   When they failed toachieve their point by such probes, they would publicly proclaim theSoviet Union responsible for the violation of Allied rights in Eerlinand for making negotiations for a peaceful settlement impossible. Thiswould lead to a very grave situation.H. .Foreign Office, S. W. 1.31st October, 1961-3-SECRET

Theyare not related to specific contingencies which is impracticable inadvance, except to the extent that Category D is roughly appropriateto the situation envisaged in paragraph 2 of the agreed minute.(3) The wording of the measures is based on that of the May 5 paper(BERCON TRI D-18a), though some changes have been made. Thereare some differences in wording between this and the new list draftedin Washington, but&apos;this is the preferred wording on practical grounds.(4) A (Z\  refusal to TTD&apos;s to Soviet Zone trade travellers wouldbe dependent on similar   measures by the Federal Republic.(5) Cn B (2), (3) and (5) the wording has been altered, becauseprohibition would entail legislative and other complications, out of pro-portion to the practical effect   anticipated, e. g. , the banning of the flowof information is impossible without full censorship.(6) On C (17) it would be desirable to implement this measurein the first place against those countries towards whom we have noobligations under international agreements, e. g. International AirTransit Agreement.(7) Item 5 in stage III of the May 5 list (which also figures in the newWashington list) is somewhat obscure;   it would appear to fall appropriatelyanywhere in categories A to C, depending on the nature of Sovietharassments.-6-SECRET
SECRETANNEX BCOPY OF TELEGRAM NUMBER 7753 TO V/ASHING TONI take strong exception to the terms used by Kohler. Thereis no question of Her Majesty&apos;s Government reneging on their commitments.The original draft presented by the Americans in Paris contained thewords &quot;in the event .... they would immediately impose a total economicembargo&quot;.    We resisted this and got them to agree to the words &quot;agreethat . . . would be an appropriate response&quot;.   In our view this representedthe furthest we could go towards accepting a commitment.   But it isno more than a moral commitment to take the necessary action at theappropriate time, for it would have been politically and constitutionallyimpossible for us to enter into a binding obligation.   Even our obligationsunder the N. A. T. O. Treaty are less far-reaching than this.   It wasalso accepted by all in Paris that it would have been tactically unwiseto present the rest of N.A. T. O. , whose co-operation is essential tothe success of the enterprise, with a Four Power fait accompli.   If theAmericans have convinced themselves that all the necesary decisionsapart from the establishment of the facts have been taken, or could betaken in advance, they are wrong.   This will be equally impossible,politically and constitutionally, even after we have obtained a statementof moral obligation from the rest of N.A. T, O. comparable to our own;but we shall then of course be better placed to fulfil our obligation whenthe time comes since N.A. T. O. participation is one of the generallyagreed pre-requisites for the operation.2.     As for the definition of the moment at which a total economicembargo would be appropriate, we have always considered it in thecontext of complete blockage and imminent hostilities.   The UnitedStates memorandum of July 25, from which all subsequent discussionhas derived stated:&quot;Blockage of access would create a situation in which the out-break of hostilities would be imminent and the economic embargo to beimposed would be total. &quot;  It may be a vague statement, but in theabsence of qualification one can only interpret &quot;blockage&quot; as total. Itwas with this in mind that we approached the United States draft minutein Paris.   This contained a number of ambivalences, most of which theAmericans readily agreed to remove.   This confirmed our impression thatcomplete, blockage was what we were talking of. One ambivalence remained:&quot;air or ground&quot;.   We regret that in the haste of the meeting we did notpress our understanding about this harder.   At the time we regarded thepoint as being a largely unreal one, and we still think that it is unlikelyto arise, though it might do (cf. paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 7640(of October 24)).   But the Americans cannot on the one hand agreewith us that the total embargo should be reserved for the final stage beforehostilities and on the other ask for a commitment to it in circumstancesin which it might still be some way off.-7-SECRET
SECRET3. There is room for argument about the moment of final crisis.To the extent that we can foresee the actual course of events (and this canonly be guesswork),   we consider that this will be upon us at the momentof total blockage and not before.   Subject to N. A. T. O, agreement, weregard ourselves as under the strongest moral obligation to impose theembargo measures, once v/e are satisfied that that moment has arrived.We are striving at present to obtain the agreement of other N. A. T. O.members to the same understanding, so that in the event they will beunder the same obligation.4. Please speak to Kohler on these lines, using as much as youthink proper of UKPel   N. A. T. O. telegram under reference, with whichI entirely agree.- u -SECRET
