COPY NO.CABINETNUCBEAR PROPULSION FOR MERCHANT shipd memorandum by the   Minister of TransportWe discussed the next steps in JulyOn 6th July, 1961, the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the then Paymaster-General (C. (61) 91) which invited the Cabinet to agree thata nuclear powered ship should not be built now, but that a research anddevelopment programme should be undertaken at an initial cost of 3- 4 millions.    Decisions on further expenditure would be taken later in the light of progress.We decided not to build a ship now2. The Cabinet agreed that the construction of a nuclear merchant ship should not be authorised at present;  and invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister for Science, to proceedwith the review of the civil research and development programme of the atomic Energy Authority.    It was also agreed that discussion should be resumed at a further meeting later in the month, i. e. July.    (C. C. (61)39th Conclusions, Minute 5.)The Chancellor has now agreed to a research programme. The review could not be completed in time to allow further discussion in July.    But the Chancellor of the Exchequer has now approved the inclusion, within the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s overall programme,of the initial programme of some  3 millions or so in respect of marinenuclear propulsion.I therefore want to announce the Governments policy. I accordingly invite my colleagues to take note of the position,now reached and to approve the terms of the announcement   annexed tothis memorandum which I should like to make in the House of Commonsearly in the new session.E, M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1.24th October, 1961.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.(61) 16924th October. 1961
CONFIDENTIALANNEXDRAFT OF GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTThe tenders received by my Department from industry for a nuclear reactor suitable for installation in a merchant ship havebeen examined in detail by the Committee on the Application of nuclear Power for Marine Purposes and by its Technical Committee,and the Government have carefully considered the matter in the lightof the advice received from these Committees.This advice shows that, while it would certainly be technicallyfeasible to build a nuclear powered ship now, nuclear propulsion formarine purposes does not offer sufficient economic promise tojustify building a merchant ship at the present time.     The Govern-ment have therefore decided that the right course in presentcircumstances is to authorise a vigorous programme of researchaimed at a reactor system which is economically attractive to a wide range of shipping.     The programme will be carried out by the atomic Energy Authority in conjunction with industry.
