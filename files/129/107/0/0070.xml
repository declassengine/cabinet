Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 220 Copy No. 5221st December, 1961CABINETMEAT RESEARCH CENTREMemorandum by the Lord chancellor at Cabinet on 5th December, 1961, I was invited, after consultation withthe Lord President and Minister for Science, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland, to make an earlyreport to the Cabinet on possible methods of imposing a levy towards meetingthe cost of financing a meat research centre (C.C. (61) 67th Conclusions, Minute 8).2. The Lord President, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland have now sent me writtenstatements of their views; those of the last two named being set out together in a paper by the Minister of Agriculture.3. I start from the statement in a letter to me from the Lord President of.11th December that all agree that an expansion of meat research is necessary.4. I share the view that, if a contribution from those concerned in the sale and purchase of meat can be secured on a fair and practical basis, this shouldbe done.5. I am naturally influenced by the fact that in July 1960 the agricultural ministers put forward this proposal which the Treasury were and are preparedto accept:&quot; We agree that the simplest and fairest method would be a compulsorylevy on producers and the trade by deduction from the deficiency payments under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme, as is at present done for the pig industry Development Authority&apos;s (P.I.D.A.) levy.&quot;6. It is accepted that s. 9 (1) of the Industrial Organisation and development act, 1947, provides the statutory authority and machinery for such a levy.7.  The Minister of Agriculture, however, feels doubt on two points:(a) Whether he can satisfy himself that &quot; the incidence of the charges asbetween different classes of undertakings in the industry will be inaccordance with a fair principle&quot;, as is required by s. 9 (2) of the act of 1947.(b) Whether a practical plan can be evolved.8. On the first point the Agricultural Ministers said in the paper which theysubmitted to the Home Affairs Committee in July 1960 and to which I have referred in paragraph 5:&quot;Under the P.I.D.A. arrangement half the deduction is paid by the producer and half by the trade, and although the trade&apos;s contribution cannotclearly be allocated to any particular interest such as wholesalers or retailers,it is accepted as a reasonable working arrangement and it seems prima faciethat it would be acceptable for the collection of contributions to a meatresearch centre.&quot;60159
- 9. I- agree and believe that a half-and-half division between producer/sellefland buyer would be a fair principle.10. On the second point the proposal is that a headage payment of 6d. oncattle, Id. on pigs and -Jd. on sheep should be deducted, as in the case of P.I.D.A.where, the Minister of Agriculture has stated in a minute to me, a deduction ismade from the guarantee price paid to the person presenting the animal for certification(usually the producer) but the latter recovers half of the amount since thisis added on to the agreed purchase price (by the auctioneer in the case of asale by auction) and is thus borne by the first purchaser.&quot;11. The difficulty seen by the Minister of Agriculture consists in the additionof half the respective charges per head to the purchase price because:(a) The levy and the charges per head are smaller than those for P.I.D.A.(b) The purchasers are more numerous and more widely spread.12. I have carefully considered the exhaustive arguments advanced by theMinister of Agriculture on every facet of every possible difficulty, but I regret thatI cannot share his conclusion of impracticability. In particular I observe:(a) Although the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme payments are calculated percwt for, cattle, per score for pigs and per lb. for sheep, the respectivenumbers of bullocks, pigs and sheep brought for certification must be known, and therefore the respective per capita deductions can be made.(b) The remaining problem is whether the seller can recover half the appropriate.: per capita levy from the purchaser.(i) It is said that in the case of sheep this will involve farthings whichare not legal tender. This can be avoided by disregarding any sum under Id. and rounding off to the nearest Id. The amountof the levy is so small that no one could reasonably object.(ii) In a sale by auction, the auctioneer would only have to make aneasily calculated addition to the price according to the numberof beasts. He would not have to account for the sum. Hewould add to the purchaser^ bill 3d. for each bullock, Id. foreach: pig and Jd. for each sheep.(iii) For a sale by private treaty, the seller would collect the purchaserscontributions from him.  But, if he did not want to be trouMed. with these small amounts, it would not affect the collection ofthe levy, because that would be deducted&apos; from his deficiencypayment.(iv) The small incidence of the levy on each sale has the furtheradvantage that if it is found to produce too large or small atotal sum, the headages could, from time to time, be variedwithout, in the view of any reasonable person, destroying theinter-relationship based on the respective value of differentanimals.13. Politically, in view of the additional  78 millions about to be voted! bythe taxpayer, I do not think that either producers or purchasers should at this moment grumble at contributing  100,000 to what everyone agrees is an excellentpurpose.14. If the Ministers departmentally concerned agree with what I say it shouldnot be necessary to restore this question to the Cabinet agenda.K.Lord Chancellors Office, S.W. 1,20th December, 1961.
