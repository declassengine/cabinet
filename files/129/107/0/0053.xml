SECRET4WfflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 203 Copy No.      571st December, 1961CABINETUNITED NATIONS DEBATES AND RESOLUTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would like to put to my colleagues, a problem which constantly faces us inthe United Nations on which I should value advice.2. One after another resolutions are put forward containing propositions andclauses which seem to run counter to our policy. The technique is something like this. First, a draft resolution is floated by the Russians or one of the near-Communist Afro-Asians. This is then recognised by the moderate Afro-Asiansto be totally unacceptable to the West, so they set about trying to amend it behind the scenes to see if they can induce the sponsors to modify the original. They oftensucceed up to the point where they (the moderates) believe we ought to vote forthe modified text but where we are still far from satisfied.3. We are then left with the unpleasant choice of either voting against, orabstaining on, the resolution and thereby offending the moderate Afro-Asianswho want to help us, or of voting for the resolution and compromising our beliefs.4. The decision is made the more difficult because the United Nations hasadopted a convention whereby its members vote for resolutions even though theydisapprove of large parts of them and are content to make their reservations inan explication de vote.5.   The following recent examples illustrate the dilemma very clearly.Resolution No. 1514 contains the following clauses:&quot; Inadequacy of political, economic, social or educational preparednessshould never serve as a pretext for delaying independence.&quot;and:&quot; Immediate steps shall be taken, in Trust and Non-self-governingTerritories or all other territories which have not yet attained independence,to transfer all powers to the peoples of those territories, without any conditionsor reservations, in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire,without any distinction as to race, creed or colour, in order to enable themto enjoy complete independence and freedom.&quot;These clauses were lately embraced in another resolution which contained a looselyworded section which would allow a travelling committee of the United nations to go to dependent territories or to hear petitioners from such territories in new York. We could not contemplate either of these things, but the moderateAfro-Asians thought we ought to have voted for the resolution. When the votecame we abstained and were left in the company of France, South Africa, spain and Portugal.6. The second example is the recent resolution on the Congo. First therewas an American draft, then one by the United Arab Republic, Liberia and Ceylonto which the Americans, instead of putting forward their draft, proposed certain amendments which took some account of our views. Most of these amendments were vetoed by the Russians.  This left a resolution which was dangerous in that60061
Foreign Office, S.W.1,30th November, 1961.it directed the Secretary-General to pay particular attention to Katanga and t1set about extracting mercenaries by force. We thought this would lead to a bloodyand prolonged fight, and would discredit the United Nations. Again we abstainedand this time were left in the minority with France.7. I am warned by Sir Patrick Dean, our representative at the united nations, that this process of honest voting (although I think it would have beeneven more honest to veto) is losing us influence with the Afro-Asians and that weshall need the support of the moderates when the extremists set about us on thefuture of our own colonial territories. I see this very clearly but what would theColonial Secretary have been able to say to Kenyatta if we had voted for the clauses in Resolution 1514 above the night before he arrived in Kenya?8. I do not mind sometimes conforming to the &quot; convention &quot; in the Assembly,but the Security Council is different because there the resolutions are or oughtto be mandatory.9. We are now faced with a resolution which puts the pressure on Portugal,and in pretty harsh terms, to start the process of self-government and independence in Angola. I think we shall vote for this as we cannot afford to have PortugueseColonialism equated with our own. But our vote will put a severe strain uponthe friendship and perhaps the co-operation of a North Atlantic ally. So it will go on.10. Our party is getting restive about our performance in the United nations and I have a lot of sympathy with them because I fear that British interests maybe harmed. I think we may easily have to withdraw our support from the united nations Congo operations if they look like causing utter confusion on the bordersof Northern Rhodesia and bringing about a Communised Congo in the end. Butthere are other British interests too, the most important of which is to keep thelargest possible number of friends on our side.11. The question is which method of handling the United Nations debatesand resolutions does us least damage? I feel that there is little alternative to ourpresent practice of taking each resolution as it comes and judging, often with only an hour or two to do so, how best to vote. We will do our best to explain to Parliament and the country what we are doing but it is not easy to present a consistent course with any governing principles behind it. If my colleagues have any views and suggestions I will gladly consider them.H.
