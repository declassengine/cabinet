SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 196129C. (61) 187 Copy No. &quot;24th November, 1961CABINETBERLIN CONTINGENCY PLANSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsMy colleagues will recall that the Cabinet discussed on 2nd November variousquestions arising out of Allied contingency plans for dealing with the Berlinquestion (C.C. (61) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2). These contingency plans areextremely complicated, especially with regard to the correlation of measures in thevarious fields, political, military and economic. I am therefore circulating for theinformation of my colleagues the attached Memorandum which sets out thesequences envisaged in our land and air contingency planning and the extent of theauthority which has already been delegated to General Norstad, the Supreme AlliedCommander, Europe, to put the military measures into effect.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I,23rd November, 1961.ft60019SECRET
2SECRETBERLIN CONTINGENCY PLANSAir Access1. -ia) If the Russians or East Germans attempted to sever air access toBerlin by means short of physical interference (that is to say, by attempts to restrictAllied air traffic to the needs of the Allied garrisons in Berlin, by demands thatAllied aircraft should put themselves under flying control of East German radiostations, by insistence that Allied aircraft should conform to East German flightregulations, by Soviet refusal to guarantee flight safety in the air corridors, by Sovietwithdrawal from the Berlin Air Safety Centre, etc.) Allied flights would bemaintained in the normal way and the Russians would be told that the Allies heldthem responsible for any incidents.(b) If the civil airlines decided that any of the Russian or East German actionsabove made it necessary for them to suspend normal flights, military crews wouldtake over civil aircraft and fly them empty to and from Berlin.(c) If these flights got through unscathed, the civil airlines would be asked toreconsider their decision to suspend normal services.{d) If the civil airlines were still not prepared to resume normal services, militarycrews would continue flying civil aircraft, but would be authorised to carrypassengers at the latter&apos;s own risk.(e) If the Russians or East Germans attempted to sever civil air access byphysical means (that is to say, by forcing down an Allied aircraft, by shooting downan Allied aircraft, by firing on an Allied aircraft with evident intent to destroy it,by forcing an Allied aircraft off its course, etc.), under our present plans (JACKPINE) fighter escorts would be introduced into the air corridors. At the sametime, military transport aircraft would be substituted for civil aircraft. Thesemeasures would be announced in advance. Simultaneously an appeal would bemade to the United Nations Security Council and certain counter-measures inthe field of civil aviation would be introduced. (These counter-measures are (i)prohibition of aircraft of North Atlantic Alliance countries calling at Soviet blocairports, (ii) closure of the Alliance airports to Soviet bloc aircraft and (iii)prevention of Soviet bloc aircraft from making transit overflights and technicalstops.) If the Soviet or East German aircraft opened fire on Allied aircraft, thefighter escort under their present rules of engagement would return the fire.(/) If Allied aircraft were fired on by Soviet or East German anti-aircraft gunsor other ground installations, under present plans they would if possible continuetheir flights without taking any counter-measures. In practice, however, this wouldprobably prove impossible if the Russians and East Germans were determined tocontinue their fire until Allied flights were forced to stop. No decision has yetbeen taken by the four Governments on other action to be taken if Allied aircraftare fired on from the ground. General Norstad, however, has proposed thatauthority should be delegated to him to authorise immediate counter-attacks byfighter escorts against ground installations unmistakably identified as firing onAllied aircraft. Her Majesty&apos;s Government so far have opposed any such delegationof authority, and this was confirmed by the Cabinet at their discussion on2nd November. In the meanwhile General Norstad has been asked by theAmbassadorial Group to inform them of the instructions which he would issueto pilots in order to minimise the risks of irresponsible attacks on ground installationsby individual pilots if the powers he wants were to be delegated to him.2. Power to implement most of the military contingency plans aboveautomatically has already been delegated to General Norstad by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government. The position is that he hasdiscretion to put (b)-(e) into effect, but has no authority to take the action at (f)without a prior decision at the time by the three Governments. The FrenchGovernment, however, have reservations at all stages. The counter-measures inthe field of civil aviation mentioned in (e) have already been accepted by the threeGovernments and the North Atlantic Council subject to a final decision at the time.SECRET
SECRET3Ground Access3. -(a) If the Russians or East Germans harassed ground access byadministrative means (that is to say, by delays in handling road and rail traffic,by demands for the payment of road tolls by Allied military vehicles, by insistingon their right to search Allied trains and vehicles, by imposing unacceptable&quot; safety &quot; or other regulations on movement by road or rail, etc.) the Allies wouldrefuse their demands and attempt to continue traffic in the normal way. Themilder economic or non-military counter-measures would probably also beimposed (in our view the economic ones against the Deutsche DemokratischeRepublik only in the first place). (These counter-measures would consist broadlyof action against certain classes of Soviet bloc travellers, and of discouragementby administrative means of cultural exchanges, as well as certain forms of economicrelations, e.g., trade fairs, with the Soviet bloc.)(b) If the Russians or East Germans denied the Allies ground access to Berlin,either by a gradual accumulation of harassing actions or by suddenly presentingunacceptable conditions, regulations or demands, the three Governments wouldfirst seek to establish beyond any doubt that access had been denied and that theRussians or East Germans were prepared to use force to deny them access.Operation FREE STYLE is designed to do this. Its object is not to compelthe East Germans or Russians to fire first, but simply to establish that blockageexists, whether in the form of fire in the most extreme case or of any other meanssuch, for instance, as physical enforcement of unacceptable documentationprocedures.(c) Once it was established that ground access had been completely blocked,the Allies would resort to an airlift and would lodge an appeal with the UnitedNations Security Council. Certain economic counter-measures would also beintroduced.  (No specific plans exist for this eventuality.)(d) Plans have also been drawn up for demonstrating the Allies&apos; refusal toaccept blockage by attempting to force, by fire if necessary, a way up the autobahnto Berlin, using a battalion- or division-strength tripartite force. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have consistently expressed their dislike of such operations owing totheir military ineffectiveness and the serious risks involved. The planning staffis also engaged in drawing up plans for a similar tripartite operation on a corpsbasis, but Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s objection to this operation for the samereasons is even stronger.4. Power to implement these plans automatically has been very severelyrestricted and General Norstad has no authority to put any of the plans inparagraph 3 into effect without the prior agreement of the three Governments. Theeconomic counter-measures at 3 {a) and 3 (c) are still under consideration in boththe Ambassadorial Group in Washington and the North Atlantic Council in Paris,and no decisions have been reached.November 1961.SECRET
