SEE Ah13.CONFIDENTIAL   RiUJiNTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVEIPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1961C. (61) 172 Copy No.   6030th October, 1961CABINETMEMOIRS: DISCLOSURE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Prime minister in 1946 the then Lord President, Mr. Herbert Morrison, announced in theHouse of Commons that the Government intended to allow &quot; the greatestpracticable freedom in the use of official information &quot; in private publications&quot; about the events of the war period and defence themes in the years immediately preceding the war&quot; (Official Report, 1st August, 1946, col. 1213). Since thensuccessive Governments have allowed a wide latitude, to former Ministers and to military commanders, to draw on official information for the purpose of warmemoirs. The spate of these books is now slackening, and political memoirs are beginning to be published which deal with the post-war years. Unless an authoritative statement is made to the contrary, it is likely to be assumed that thegreater latitude allowed in respect of the war years will be extended to memoirsrelating to the post-war period. After discussion with some of my colleagues Ihave come to the conclusion that a public warning ought now to be given thatthis greater latitude was a departure from the normal rules applicable to peacetimegovernment, and that a stricter standard will be applied in future in dealing with applications for permission to use official information in private publicationsrelating to the post-war period.2. I attach (Annex A) a memorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet whichsummarises the main considerations affecting the use of official information in private memoirs (i) by former Ministers, and (ii) by retired members of the CrownServices, both civil and military.3. I also attach (Annex B) a draft of a public announcement, which mightbe made as a written reply to a Parliamentary Question in the House of Commons.I contemplate that this announcement should be made shortly before Parliamentrises for the Christmas recess.
4.   I invite special attention to the following points:(a) It would be impracticable to hold the position that there should be nopartial disclosure of official information until all the relevant recordsare open, after 50 years, to inspection in the Public Record Office.But, equally, it is impracticable to devise any hard and fast rules to govern earlier disclosure. This must remain a matter of judgment inparticular cases. But it will be easier to apply that judgment, in face of the pressures which develop in favour of publication, if there is ageneral public understanding that permission for such disclosure will bemore sparingly given in future. In particular, I think it will be helpful if it can be made plain that permission will not normally be given infuture for the disclosure of official information which is of comparatively recent date. No rigid time-limit would be practicable;but I hope my colleagues will agree that disclosures, especially ofCabinet proceedings, are specially undesirable when they follow soon after the events to which they relate. The difficulties of allowing privatepublication of official information are certainly lessened by the passageof time or by change of political circumstances.(b) I attach particular importance to the point made in paragraph 6 of annex A, viz., that special difficulty arises over memoirs which areconstructed on the basis of official documents and keep closely to the wording of those documents, whether by quotation or by paraphrase.For this as well as other reasons it is specially desirable that ministers should not retain official documents in their private possession onrelinquishing office. The normal rule is that, while a Minister mayexceptionally retain copies of official documents which he wrote himself,he should not, on relinquishing office, remove any other official documents (whether Cabinet papers or departmental records) fromofficial custody. I hope that, when the time comes, all my colleagues will be careful to comply with this rule.(c) I propose that this opportunity should be taken of reaffirming and extending the conventions governing the use of official information in private memoirs by former members of the Crown Services, on thelines discussed in Part II of Annex A. I consider that, with the exceptions indicated in paragraphs 10-12 of Annex A, all members ofthose Services should observe the convention that they should not,before or after retirement, make any public disclosure of advice givento Ministers by their official advisers or of the confidential relationsbetween Ministers and their official advisers in the formulation ofpolicy. I hope the Cabinet will agree that all necessary steps should now be taken to ensure observance of this convention by members ofthe Foreign Service, the Home Civil Service and the Armed Forces.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,27th October, 1961.
ANNEX AMEMOIRS: DISCLOSURE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of the CabinetIThe disclosure of official information in private publications has to beconsidered against the general background of the 50-year rule i.e., the rule wherebyofficial documents (including Cabinet documents) are not open to public inspectionin the Public Record Office until they are 50 years old. This rule will be progressively undermined if official documents are disclosed at earlier dates, on anysubstantial scale, in memoirs published by private individuals.2. The sanctions for enforcing compliance with the 50-year rule are the official secrets Act, 1911, and, in the case of former Ministers, the Privy Councillor^ Oath.Under the statute it is an offence to make any unauthorised disclosure ofinformation obtained in an official capacity. Under the Oath a Privy Councillormay not disclose Cabinet proceedings without the permission of the Sovereign,which is sought through the Government of the day.3. The general rule against disclosure has been deliberately waived in respectof memoirs of the two Great Wars of the twentieth century.There were various reasons for treating these periods exceptionally.  Thus (a) Military commanders are open to public criticism for their conduct of operations and can reasonably claim a right of reply. It has seemedunreasonable to deny the same facility to their political superiors.(b) Wartime administration raises problems which are of special public interest and analysis of them may point valuable lessons for the future.(c) In both wars there have been coalition Governments and less reasontherefore to fear that disclosure of Ministerial discussions will lead to political embarrassment.id) Disclosures relating to war periods, when the world is divided betweenallies and enemies, involve less risk of embarrassment in relation toforeign Powers.(e) Official war histories are published well in advance of the 50-year period.4. Most of these considerations are inapplicable in time of peace. the deliberate decision to allow a special latitude in respect of the two war periodsimplied that greater reticence should be observed in respect of peacetime periods.There, is, however, a risk that authors will expect that the special facilitiesdeliberately allowed for the period 1939-45 will be continued for the period after1945 unless an authoritative statement is made to the contrary.5. Apart from the danger to the 50-year rule, there are special objections tothe early disclosure of official documents in private publications.  Thus (a) If a former Minister makes such disclosures in memoirs published soon after he ceases to be a Minister, this may be embarrassing to Ministerialcolleagues still holding office.(b) Such disclosures may also be embarrassing to the Government in office in their current relations with foreign Powers.(c) Confidence between Ministerial colleagues, which is essential to the systemof Cabinet Government, may be undermined if it comes to be thoughtthat Cabinet proceedings or confidential exchanges between ministers may be disclosed, relatively soon after they occur, in private memoirs.6. There is special objection to memoirs which are constructed on the basisof official papers whether Cabinet or Departmental papers or Ministerial minutes and keep closely to the wording of those documents, whether by quotation or byparaphrase. Ex-parte statements which are based on partial disclosure of official documents are always liable to provoke a demand for the official publication of allthe relevant documents.59876aCONFIDENTIAL
ii8. Certain further considerations apply to former servants of the Crown. Inthe Home Civil Service it is an established convention that senior officers do not publish, evert after retirement, memoirs involving the disclosure of confidentialrelations with or between Ministers. This convention is congruous with the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility. For, as Ministers publicly take the whole blame for apolicy which fails, officials cannot reasonably expect publicly to claim a share ofthe credit for a policy which succeeds.8. This convention has not hitherto applied to the other services of the Crown.There is no tradition which discourages former members of the Foreign Service from publishing memoirs of their official career; and it has not been regarded as a breach of professional etiquette for a former member of that Service to publish reasonablecriticism of past Government policy, even though his comments are founded on information which he obtained while actively employed in the service of the Crown.Nor is there any Service tradition which requires former members of the armed forces to refrain from public comment on matters of policy with which they wereassociated before retirement.9. If the general principle underlying the convention in the Home Civil service is sound, it should apply to all the official advisers of Ministers, to whatever Servicethey belong. If it is right that officials should not disclose the advice which theygave in confidence to Ministers in the formulation of policy, this restriction should apply, not only to senior members of the Home Civil Service, but also to senior officers of the Foreign Service and to senior members of Service staffs who have beenin a similar relation to Ministers.10. If this principle were applied to the Foreign Service, it would not prevent a former Ambassador from publishing an account of his, mission. Ambassadorsdischarge, proprio nomine, a public task and it is not unreasonable that they shouldbe free to publish, after retirement, their account of it. Nor need it necessarilyprevent a former member of the Foreign Service from publishing memoirs dealingwith the whole period of his service, so long as he observes the convention that nodisclosure should be made of advice given by officials to Ministers or of the confidential relations between Ministers and their advisers in the formulation ofpolicy. The liberty accorded to Ambassadors could be extended, mutatis mutandis,to United Kingdom High Commissioners in self-governing countries of theCommonwealth, and to Governors-General and Governors in territories for whichthe Colonial Office is responsible.11. If the same principle were applied to the Armed Forces, it would notrestrict the publication of memoirs by a commander in the field. He takes credit forsuccess and accepts blame for failure. He is exposed to criticism and should be free to answer it. Nor would it restrict the publication of memoirs of regimental duty,in peace or war. It would, however, mean that Service officers would need to observe a greater measure of discretion in publishing, after retirement, accounts ofperiods when they held Staff appointments in which it was their duty to adviseMinisters in the formulation of policy.12. An exception might be made in favour of Chiefs of Staff. On the onehand they are the most intimate advisers of Ministers in the formulation of defence policy; on the other they are, unlike most civil servants, public figures who may tosome extent be held accountable at least to public opinion, though not toParliament for the consequences of their advice. They are publicly acknowledgedto be the professional military advisers of the Government, and as the professionalheads of their Services they share to some extent the credit or the blame for thesuccess or the failure of defence policies with which they have been personallyassociated. In this respect they stand midway between the commander in the field and the anonymous staff officer. On balance it seems unreasonable to deny them theright to justify in public print their record in office as Chiefs of Staff.Ill13. If the current practice is to be tightened up the following action will benecessary:(a) In considering requests by former Ministers for permission to discloseofficial information somewhat stricter standards will have to be appliedthan in the recent past.CONFIDENTIAL
(b) For the Armed Forces it will be necessary to consider some amendment to Service Regulations; and a regular procedure will have to beestablished for conveying a suitable warning to officers taking up, andrelinquishing, staff appointments which involve a confidentialrelationship with Ministers. The Chiefs of Staff might also be askedto do what they can to build up a general understanding and acceptance of the convention throughout the forces.(c) In the Home Civil Service and the Foreign Service administrative action can be taken on a confidential basis to bring about a general understanding of the convention.(Signed)      NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th October, 1961.ANNEX draft PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND ANSWERQuestion:To ask the Prime Minister what is the present attitude of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards the disclosure of official information in private publicationsby former Ministers or servants of the Crown.Answer:Official information may not be disclosed in private publications without the permission of the Government. In respect of the war of 1939-45 and the events which led to its outbreak, considerable latitude was given to make such disclosures,for reasons which were explained in a statement made to the House by the thenLord President of the Council on 1st August, 1946. But this, like the earlierdispensation in relation to the First World War, was a special and deliberatelyauthorised departure from normal practice. The Government consider that thetime has now come to re-establish the stricter conventions applicable to peacetimeadministration.I recognise that memoirs by individuals who have held high office under theCrown will often make a valuable contribution to history. I also recognise thatsuch individuals may, on occasion, properly claim the right publicly to defendpolicies and actions for which they may be publicly held to account. On the otherhand, it is the rule that official documents are not generally open to public inspection until they are 50 years old; and it is the duty of the Government toprevent any substantial inroad upon the principle implicit in this rule. It is their special duty to prevent disclosures which would impair the confidential characterof discussions in the Cabinet and its committees and of the other processes bywhich policy is formulated including the confidential relations between ministers and their official advisers. While, therefore, applications for permission to disclosein private publications official information relating to a peacetime period willcontinue to be judged on their individual merits, the Government will in futurepay particular regard to the considerations which I have indicated and will seek to encourage a proper standard of discretion in the public treatment of the affairs of State. In particular, permission will not normally be given for the disclosure of official information which is of comparatively recent date. It would be impracticable to work to any precise time-limit within the 50-year period, but it is evident that the objections to allowing private publication of official information will often be reduced by the passage of time or by change of political circumstances.October 1961.CONFIDENTIAL
