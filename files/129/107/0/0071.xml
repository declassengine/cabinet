SECRET4IhIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1961C. (61) 221 Copy No.  J g21st December, 1961CABINETEDUCATIONAL expenditure memorandum by the Minister of EducationMy colleagues have asked me (C.C. (61) 73rd Conclusions, item 1), to explain the consequences of reducing educational investment in the years 1963-64, 1964-65and .1965-66 from the proposed levels of  134-6 millions,  136-4 millions and 139-2 millions to averages of:(a)  120 millions per annum.(b)  125 millions per annum.(c)  130 millions per annum.In this context educational investment means the value of work done in the relevantyear.2. The programmes of starts for 1961-62 and 1962-63 are all authorised andthus known to the local education authorities and the general public. This hasbeen the position since July 1960. We should have announced the 1963-64programme at the same time this summer; the delay is now very serious.3. I think that we are all agreed that the training college expansion programme and technical college building must go ahead as now planned. The smallprogrammes are not big enough to be worth cutting, or have been so severely cutalready (e.g., the youth service programme) as to be ruled out as candidates forfurther reductions. Therefore, the whole of the cut must fall on the schoolsprogramme.4. As I told the Cabinet in my paper C. (61) 212, this is at present distributed as follows:Approximate value of newauthorisations proposed for 1963-64  millions(i) Schools for children who would otherwise have nowhereto go    ...      ...      ............... 28-2 (47 per cent)(ii) Reorganisation of all age schools     ......... 5 - 6 (9 - 4 per cent)(iii) Science projects   .;................ 7 - 6 (12 - 6 per cent)(iv) Other improvement projects (mainly workshops)   ... 3 -4 (5-7 per cent)(v) Replacements and major remodellings        ...... 15-2 (25-2 per cent)5. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, made the point in relation to category 4 (i)that it contains a hidden improvement element. This is true. If children move from the centre of a northern city to a new town, or to an area of expandingpopulation in the south, class sizes will tend to fall in the exporting area. But i cannot on this account reduce school building in the receiving areas. Nor, as yet,is there any scope for closing the worst of the old schools in the exporting areas, andconcentrating the children in the better buildings. These are the very areas that have both the biggest concentration of slum schools, and the biggest concentration of over-size classes.60164
6.   We cannot cut reorganisation projects (category (ii)) without breaking tipfirmest pledge given in the 1958 White Paper on Secondary Education for All(Cmnd. 604).  We have repeated it many times since.It would be totally inconsistent with our policy of improving the competitiveefficiency of the economy to cut work in categories (iii) and (iv), particularly theformer.&apos;7. So the whole of any cut ought to fall on category (v), replacements andremodellings. But without cancelling authorisations already given, and so far asI know no other Department is being asked to do this, the cut could be confined to work in this category only with an average investment of  130 millions per annum.At this level of investment, the 1961-62 and 1962-63 programmes of starts couldstand. It would, however, be necessary to cut  10 millions&apos; worth of replacementsand remodellings from the proposed 1963-64 programme of starts; thereafter newauthorisations for projects of these types could be given at about half the current rate. We could not deny that we had gone back on the policy of the 1958 white paper.8. With averages of  120 millions or  125 millions, the consequences wouldbe even more serious: the cut would have to fall on programmes already authorised,and could not be restricted to replacements and remodellings.9. This is so because the momentum of the programmes already authorised for 1961-62 and 1962-63 would produce in 1963-64 a total of  112 millions&apos; work done, even if no new major projects were allowed to start in that year.10. This high total of work done arises from the fact that for educationalbuilding projects there is the following relationship between work started and work done:20 per cent done in the year in which work starts.40 per cent in the next year.30 per cent in the year after.10 per cent in the fourth year.11. So if existing authorisations for 1961-63 were to be honoured, all we could afford to start in 1963-64 within a total of  120 millions work done in that year would be  120- 112^8x5^40 millions. This would mean making a cut in building starts of about  70 millions.12. This is clearly impracticable. It would in fact be necessary to begin the cuts before 1963-64, and to invite my colleagues to agree that the resulting savings in 1961-63 below the totals now authorised could be offset against an investment in 1963-64 and 1964-65 a little higher than  120 millions or  125 millions. It wouldnot be realistic to attempt to get down to  120 or  125 millions until 1965-66.13. On this basis, the average figure of  120 millions would mean introducingat once a system of starting date controls to defer about  5 millions worth of work from 1961-62 to 1962-63, and about  18 millions from the 1962-63 programme as increased by the carry-over from 1961-62. The new projects which I could thenapprove for 1963-64, totalling  30 millions, would be less than half what the localeducation authorities are expecting me to announce under the 1958 White Paper.At constant prices, the average annual level of starts would be the lowest since theearly 1950s.14. The effect would be to defer for approximately two years the start of allreplacement and remodelling projects authorised but not yet started. No newauthorisations for projects of this type could be given before 1964-65, when this partof the programme could be resumed at about half the current rate of  15 millions per annum. Moreover, although authorisations already given for reorganisation,science and other improvement projects could be honoured, there would have tobe a moratorium in 1963-64 on new authorisations for projects of these types.Projects cut from the programme of the 1.958 White Paper would total about 48 millions.15. At an average figure of  125 millions, I should have to defer for approximatly 18 months the start of all replacement and remodelling projectsauthorised but not yet started.  No new authorisations for projects of this type
i^uld be given until 1964-65. New authorisations in 1963-64 for projects forreorganisation, science and other improvements would be cut from  17 millions to  9 millions. Projects cut from the programme of the 1958 White Paper wouldtotal about  33 millions.16. In short, at any one of the average levels of investment I was asked toexamine, we should have to admit that we were going back on the pledges givenin the 1958 White Paper. And at the two lower levels,  120 and  125 millions,it would also be necessary to introduce new controls over sta/ting dates to cutfrom the 1961-63 programmes work already authorised. Both politically andeducationally, I would regard the cancellation of existing authorisations as extremelydangerous.17. As the cuts would fall largely on replacements and major remodellingsthe consequent reduction in current expenditure would be small. These jobs donot involve the employment of extra teachers, and extra current expenditure arisingfrom higher standards in the new schools is offset by reduced expenditure on repairs and maintenance. The net additional charge is very close to the loan charges onthe new or remodelled buildings. On this basis, but making allowance for theeffect of deferring some reorganisation and improvement projects if cuts to 20 millions and  125 millions were enforced, the following table sets out the savings to be expected.Reduction in Recurrent Costs of Local Authorities Resultingfrom Cuts in InvestmentCut to Cut to Cut to 120 millions  125 millions  130 millions1962-63 ... 0-4 0-4 0 11963-64 ... 1-2 1-0 0-41964-65 ... 2-4 1-9 0-91965-66        ... 3-8 2-9 1-518. I hope therefore that this further information will enable my colleagues to approve my proposals, and I must say again that the delay in announcing the1963-64 programme is having an increasingly bad effect on my relations with local authorities.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,21st December, 1961.
