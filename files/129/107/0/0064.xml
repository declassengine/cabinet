HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1961C. (61) 214 Copy No.     5 512th December, 1961.cabinet trade WITH SOVIET BLOC countries memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Prime Minister asked me to preside over a small group consisting of theChief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of theBoard of Trade to consider a number of unresolved issues in the field of trade and agricultural policy. The President of the Board of Trade has already reportedto the Cabinet (C. (61) 208) on one of these matters the dumping of milk powder.The other two issues arise out of the current Polish and Roumanian trade negotiations.Polish Bacon2. As the Cabinet are aware from their previous discussion (C.C. (61) 62ndConclusions, Minute 5), the President of the Board of Trade wishes to increasea number of quotas for imports from Poland, including the quota for bacon, inorder to secure an important export order for aircraft. The Cabinet asked for anestimate of the effect of his proposal on subsidy payments. From our examinationit appears that it would have only an insignificant effect on the size of the subsidy.We were, however, concerned about the effects of an announcement to increasethe quota upon farming opinion, and upon the prospects of securing a voluntary agreement with the Danes for limiting their supplies to the United Kingdom market;if such an agreement could be reached there might be a saving of  If millions in the subsidy in the current year, and from  6- 10 millions in a full year. Thetwo Ministers directly concerned agreed to consider whether something could bedone to meet the Polish request without having to announce an increase in theexisting quota for Poland of 48,500 tons.3. They are prepared to accept a solution based on keeping the quota at48,500 tons on the understanding that there would be some over-licensing. Theyare, however, unable to agree on the extent of the over-licensing. In June last, itwas agreed that licences should be issued for 2,800 tons of Polish bacon to count against this year&apos;s quota. This arrangement was not published. The Presidentof the Board of Trade would like to cancel this &quot; overdraft &quot; and at the same timeto over-license to the extent of 1,200 tons, thus providing the 4,000 tons extra forwhich the Poles have asked. The Minister of Agriculture would be prepared onlyto allow the Poles to anticipate their next year&apos;s quota by 2,800 tons. He says that to go further would seriously weaken the chances of getting a voluntary agreement to restrict supplies. On the other hand, the President of the Board ofTrade says that we shall lose the order for aircraft unless we can offer the Polesthe full 4,000 tons extra.Roumanian Meat and Fruit Pulp4. A similar problem arises in the trade negotiations with the Roumanians.Here the President of the Board of Trade has told us that our whole trade with roumania is at risk (as well as compensation payments to British nationals) unless we offer her quotas for 5,000 tons of beef and 50 tons of fruit pulp.60115
5. We thought that it would be difficult to justify publicly establishing alnew quota for beef imports at the present time, when the meat market is heavilyover-supplied and the Minister of Agriculture is about to present a supplementary estimate of about  60- 70 millions for agricultural subsidies, largely on accountof meat. We therefore asked the President of the Board of Trade to considercertain other suggestions we made for keeping open the trading opportunities in roumania.&apos; - 6. He has now considered these suggestions but reaffirms his conviction that,unless we meet the Roumanian requests on beef and fruit pulp, we shall notonly lose opportunities for developing new exports, but we shall also put seriouslyat risk our exporters&apos; recently won foothold in this market.conclusion. As we were unable to reach agreement on these two issues I am bringing them to the attention of the Cabinet.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,11th December, 1961.
