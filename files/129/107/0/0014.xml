We are in the early stages of the next Wages Round.     All the big unions - Transport and General;   General and Municipal;Amalgamated Engineering Union;   National Union of Railwaymen (andthe other railway unions);    Electrical Trades Union;   agricultural workers - have claims in for wage increases.     Many of the smallerunions also have claims in.     The most important industries inwhich claims have either been submitted or are expected at an earlydate, are Engineering;    Shipbuilding;  Agriculture and Road Haulagein the private sector;   Railways;    Coalmining;    London Transportbuses;    British Road Services;    and Electricity and Gas Supply inthe public sector.&apos;2.     The pay claim of the Road Haulage Industry will probably bethe first major claim to reach a decisive stage.     The Road HaulageWages Council submitted to the Minister of Labour on 21st Septemberproposals for increased wages and reduction of hours.     TheGovernment1 s decision on the award, when made known, may not bethought by the Transport and General Workers Union to justify astrike, and even if a strike were called of the workers directly affected, sympathetic action would not necessarily be induced amongthe petrol tanker drivers or among privately employed lorry drivers,such as those   used by the British Oxygen Company.     If, however, a road haulage strike spread to petrol tankers and the British OxygenCompany drivers, the results would be very serious for industry inview of the wide dependence on both the products involved.     The -pay of these other workers is covered by separate negotiating machinery,  and there is no significant risk of a stoppage by thepetrol tanker drivers except by way of sympathetic action, but pay claims are in the offing for both the British Oxygen Companydrivers and the Company&apos;s production workers.3.     The claim on behalf of the Electricity Supply Industry is also likely to reach a decisive stage in the near future.     The claim was presented on 20th September, and a reply is to be given on18th October, but it is likely that negotiations will continuebeyond that date.     If a strike were to take place in the industry,the co-operation of the supervisory staff would be necessary if theoutput of electricity were not to stop completely, and, even withtheir co-operation, no more than k\0 per cent of the load could be meteI+.     It seems unlikely that the other claims, with the possible exception of London buses, will reach a decisive stage until later in the year.5-     The attitude of the trade unions to attempts to defer settle-ment in accordance with government policy that there should be a.&quot;pause&quot; has proved to be very hostile.     On the other hand, theleaders are so far showing no great disposition to press their claims with undue speed or to hasten the normal course which theyfollow through the various negotiating procedures.     There appearsto be no considerable enthusiasm for being the first to make adirect challenge to the government.     In the context of a wagespause the unions may however show greater solidarity than is
normal, for example,  if manual workers in Electricity Supply-strike,  the Power Station Supervisors may refuse to undertakeextra duties.B^,   ^-T^e^^pjO^siJ^le,:effect of strikes In the,^varj^cu.s^indusj^rie^s(i)   EjLeot ri city, ^suj^l.y^^ndust^rj;6.     A strike at the power stations would have immediate and.serious consequences..   Practically all industry is now heavily dependent on electricity for its motive power, and any majorinterruption of supplies would have a crippling effect on production,.      It would also have a very serious effect on essential public services? such as water, hospitals,  tele-communications, transport and sewage pumping, as well as on thegeneral availability of heating and lighting.7.      If the strike were confined to manual worke rs and the supervisory staff remained at their posts,  it would probably bepossible to maintain selected generating stations in operati.11,provided that labour with the necessary skill to help the super-visory staff could be found together with labour for coalhandling and ash disposal..    Under such circumstances and atthis period of the year it is unlikely that, at best, morethan 1+0 per cent of the load could be met-     Cuts of theorder of 60% in electricity supplies would have the mostserious consequences for industry and the economy of thecountry.    &quot;.7hile it is. usual to look to the Services to providethe necessary manual labour, the situation could not be improved merely by increasing the number of servicemen avail-able (even if this were possible), because of the difficulty ofdeploying them and supervising them.8*      It is impossible to estimate with any firmness the preciserequirements for Service labour, since these depend on a num-ber of factors including the time of year,  etc.   But at a rough estimate, with a strike confined to manual workers, tomaintain in operation the selected generating stationsrequired to meet only some l+O per cent of the normal load, itis thought that Ik,000 men might be needed,  of whom 6,000would need technical skill, to work under supervision.    It isnot thought that there would be any difficulty in meeting the requirement for 8,000 general duties men, but no precise figure for the remaining - and vital - 6,000 could be given without going right down to Army units,&apos; which has so far not beenatithorised.   As a broad guide, to the extent that the availablemanpower falls short of requirements, the output will be pro-disproportionately lower09o      It is, however, by no means safe to assume that the super-visory staffs would,  in the present industrial climate,  remain at their posts.     Apart from a very few men in the top posts,almost all supervisory staff in the industry, including power station superintendents, are members of the Electrical PowerEngineers Association (EoP.EoA.), and it is quite possible thatthe supervisory staffs would refuse to co-operate if any decision were taken on the manual workers&apos;  claim which wouldappear to the E.P.E.A. to be palpably unjust, e.g. (a) a refusal to negotiate, or (b)  a refusal to go to arbitration or (c) a refusal to accept an award.      If the supervisory staffssupported a strike of the manual workers, we are advised that acomplete shut-down could not be avoided.     A most gravesituation would then arise.   A strike leading to a completeshut-down would completely disrupt many essential social,transport and industrial undertakings and probably do more harm to the economy, and cause mo.ve hardship to the community, more quickly than any other type of strike.-2-
10.    The reasons why there would be a complete shut-down ifthe E.P.E.A. were to support a manual workers&apos;  strike can bebriefly summed up as followss-(a) Servicemen available of like professional standardsto those engaged in supervision and control numberaround 700 and could supply only a very smallfraction of the numbers required.(b) Such personnel as were available would  lack know-ledge both of the techniques of modern power stationoperation and of the actual physical disposition of controls.(c) It would take days, if not weeks, for them toacquire this knowledge.(d) Training could not take place in advance of a strikewithout arousing suspicion and perhaps precipitatingthe strike.(e) If an attempt were made to operate with insufficientskill, there would be a serious risk of putting the plant out of commission.(f) Only the minimum of spare plant is kept, and&quot; it might take twelve months to get the situation working again,with consequent long-term damage to the economy,11.    Further, it is likely that(a) if members of the E.P.E.A. &quot;worked to rule&quot;, i.e.giving instructions but not helping or explaining,again a complete shut-down could not be avoided,  sincemost of the considerations above \7ould still applyj(b) if a small proportion of the senior supervisory staffstayed loyal, they would be too few and scattered to do anything effectivej(c) a station that has shut down could not start up againwithout the help of members of the E.B.E.A.    If thewhole industry shut down,  starting up again would bean extremely complicated and difficult operation, ofwhich there has been no past experience.12.    (ii)   The JRaiJLwa^sThe effect of a complete railway strike is extremely diffi-cult to estimate, because this would depend on the availability of alternative means of transport, and in this connection theattitude road, transport drivers would adopt is of obvious impor-tanoe.    Generally speaking, they would probably refuse to carry aconsiderable &quot;proportion of the traffic normally moved by rail, butit is reasonably safe to assume that there would be some increase,and perhaps a fairly substantial increase, in road movement, main-ly in vehicles operating under &quot;C&quot; carriers&apos;  licences, the driversof which are not so completely organised as those employed byholders of !&apos;A;1 and &quot;B&quot; carriers&apos; licences.    The Ministry ofTransport have prepared plans,  so far as is possible in advance ofan emergency, for making the maximum and most efficient use of theroad transport that may be available.   They would requireemergency powers to enable persons operating vehicles to bedirected to carry specified goods for specified purposes.-3-S EC RET
[pro jfcs, nn&amp; gptvap1113.    The most vital traffic carried by the railways is c.qalsDoth because of its quantity and because of its importance to industry, and in particular to power stations, which would bein difficulty if their stocks fell to the point at which only two weeks&apos;  supply could be met, and to gas.plants.     Otherindustries, especially iron and steel, would also suffer.Towards the end of the partial railv/ays strike of 1955 about *000,000 tons of coal a month were being moved by road, but itcannot be assumed that this would be possible in the event of acomplete railway strike, or even during a partial stoppage shouldany co-operative resistance movement develop as between employees of the rail and road industries.II4.   About 80 per cent of f006^..,supjoiiejs are moved by roads,  sothat provided panic buying could be avoided, a railway strikewhich did not spread to road transport -vKvnld not be likely tohave a vital effect on food supplies.     The supply of milk,especially in London is, however, an irrrportant exception and wouldbe a major problem,  since the facilities for carrying milk by roadare limited.15.    given in a complete railway strike it is probable that after a time some trains could be run if supervisory staff were willingto help, but the best estimate that can be made is that between200 and 300 trains could perhaps be run each day in this way.     Afew additional trains a day could be run if it were decided touse available Army train crews as well, but the help which theServices can give in running trains is extremely limited and wouldnot materially affect the number of trains that could be run.Service lorries and drivers would therefore be needed for mailservices and to supplement such road services as remainedavailable, but other priority demands on the limited service personnel available may arise at the same time, e.g. to driveoil tankers.(iii)   A.jRoad.Jlj?Anspprp^ Strikes(a).   Goods16.   A road transport strike could have grave consequences.Road transport now normally moves more of the country&apos;s goodsthan does rail.     And most rail haulage depends on road collec-tion and delivery.17.   Provided petrol and derv were still available^&quot; a strikeby the Transport and General Workers Union would not completelyparalyse roacl haulage:(i)    there are many small haulage firms which areowner/driver or family concerns, or in which theTransport and General Workers Union, has no members(ii)    the &apos;0&apos;  licensed drivers (he. drivers of vehiclesowned by and working exclusively for one manufacturer-h- ^See paragraphs 27 et. seq. for the possible effect of railway and road transport strikes in oil distribution.
ECKETor trader)  sometimes belong to the union of theindustry with which they are connected,  and not toa transport union;(iii)    the railway collection and delivery drivers areNoUoR. members;(iv)    driving of road vehicles (except in the reallyheavy classes) is now a commonly available skill,so volunteer manpower could play an important part.18.    It is very difficult to evaluate these considerations,particularly in the absence of consultations with the industry.But it is not inconceivable that something like half of present road goods transport capacity might be available iftho strike was by Transport and General Workers Union driversonly.     Even if all Union men came out, perhaps 30 per cent of road transport might still run, or more depending on use ofvolunteer labour.19.    The ability of the railways to make up the road transportdeficiency would be limited by:(i)    present rai.lv/ay manpower, which is already short,particularly in some areas;(ii)    how far extra traffic could be put on the railwaywithout risk that the railwaymen would declare thegoods &quot;black&quot;, or would strike themselves in sympathy;(iii)    availability of collection and delivery byroad.Provided the railwaymen did not strike, the net result might be that some part of the road burden could be put on torail, but nothing like all of it.&apos;20.    If there were a general road transport strike, it wouldbe necessary to take emergency powecs if other transportresources (for example, G licence vehicles) were to be fullydeployed to meet the deficiencies.21.    The possible scale of contribution by the Services tothe road transport problem would be small in relation to thegeneral effort needed.      It would be best employed in certainkey roles, e.g. ijetrol tankers, milk tankers, for really heavyvehicles, or on other special tasks, where the use of a dis-ciplined and fully skilled force would greatly ease the operational problems.
(&quot;b)    Passenger22.      The Railway is still the predominant long distance carrierof passengers and has spare capacity.     long distance coachservices do not make a large contribution, and much that they dois in fact inessential.     A strike of long distance buses -wouldbe ho great problem.23.      The bus is the predominant short distance carrier, and apart from London carries the bulk of the commuting load.Where rail offers an alternative,  it is usually already loadedto capacity at morning and evening peaks.      Loss of &quot;buses would therefore prima facie be serious.      Private transport is theonly alternative.     But in the provincial bus strike of 1957, no great difficulties occurred,  so the ability of private transport to take the load seems reasonably proven, particularly since ithas grown and is still growing in capacity.2 b,..      There are however implications of the use of private trans-port for commuting which are examined in the Ministry ofTransport&apos;s memorandum to the Official Committee on CivilEmergencies &quot;Movement of commuters during a strike of publicpassenger transport&quot; (E(0)C(61)2).(iv)    A combined rail and road transport strike   .25.      A most serious situation would arise in this event,  thoughit is reasonable to assume that a substantial number of vehicles,and in particular those belonging to small operators and driveneither by men who do not belong to unions,  or by members of theowner&apos;s family, would continue&apos; to operate.      Other vehiclescould no doubt be kept going by the use of voluntary labour.It is however clear that the help of the services would berequired.      The maximum number of Services vehicles it would bepossible to deploy would be 10,500, varying in capacity from oneto ten tons ( Q5% are 3 tonners and 10% ten tons) but not all ofthese could be made available immediately, and it is not certain whether drivers would be available for all of them.    Unfortunately,the need for drivers would be greater than the need forvehicles, many of which would be lying idle.      There are arrange-ments for the allocation of civilian volunteer drivers to the firms most needing them.     Available road and rail transport would be utilised to ensure the movement of priority trafficaccording to an agreed list.26.      The effects of a combined rail and road passenger trans-port strike would cause the greatest difficulty in London, but even here the use of private motor transport - on the assumptionthat petrol was available - would probably provide a workablesolution if the traffic load were spread and all cars were filledvirtually to capacity.      The extra traffic would, however,require the provision of parking space and police control on a scale greater than has been necessary in previous strikes andthe Metropolitan Police are reviewing their emergency plans,  inconnection with the Ministry of Transport.      It&apos;might.benecessary to make special arrangements for the movement of essential workers who have been conveyed to and from their houses in previous strikes in specially hired coaches.-6-
(v)    Oil distribution27c    About 80% of oil is moved otherwise than by rail., and inthe event of a rail strike general oil supplies should not be seriously affected until perhaps the second week except forplaces mainly rail-fed, e.g, the Midlands and the Glasgow andDundee areas of Scotland.     About 20% goes through B0T.C0 portswhere it is understood that a large part of the staff are N.U.R.members, and the success of Ministry of Transport efforts tokeep the ports open would have an important bearing.     The oil companies can be relied upon to move oil forward if there is adequate warning of a strike.28.    If a strike of road transport workers spread to oildistribution tankers there would be an immediate effect on suppliesof motor and aviation fuels and domestic and agricultural (tractor)paraffin, and to a less extent oil used for industrial purposes orfor central heating.     Except where supplies are deliveredentirely by water and/or rail direct to consumers, a complete stoppage of work by road tanker drivers would mean cessation ofall deliveries.     Most garages would run dry in well under a week with bulk consumption lasting varying periods up to 3 weeks,depending on stocks and consumption in strike conditions.29.    It would be necessary to introduce immediately a system of priorities, based on an existing list, to ensure that such supplies as may be available were devoted to the maintenance of essential services.     But to do even this, and after allowing forthe possibility that some voluntary labour might be available, itis clear that the help of the Services would be essential.     Toprovide anything like normal deliveries it is estimated that approximately 30,000 troops would &quot;be required for use as follows t-Drivers 9,700Mates 9,700&quot;Depot men 9,000Water transport   1,60030,000Most of the depot staffs would find it difficult to continue workif troops were manning the road tankers and while in many casesoil company drivers operate single handed. Service or volunteerdrivers would undoubtedly need mates.30.   A rough basis of planning has already been worked out betweenthe War office and the Ministry of Power for the use of Servicemenas tanker drivers, but the planning cannot be taken furtherwithout consultation with the industry and enquiries within theServices at unit level.      In view of the risk of leakages thesesteps have not been taken (although the Secretary of the oil industry Emergency Committee has been told in confidence what theoutline plan is);    but the Service enquiries, once authorised,would probably take no more than two days to complete.31     The existing priorities scheme, referred to in paragraph 29,for the distribution of petrol to essential users does not cover the petrol requirements of the Services.     In&apos; the event of a strikeit may become necessary to ask Ministers to reach a decision onthe relative priority to be given .to military and civilian purposes.As a first step,  the Official Committee have invited the service departments to inform the Ministry of Power of the extent of their essential petrol requirements in the event of a strike of petrol-7-
[^) tanker drivers;    and the Ministry to review the current scheme of priorities for petrol distribution for civil purposes and toconsider the effect on this scheme of the Service requirements.(vi) Oxygen Supplies32.   Recent experience has shown the importance of oxygen supplies,which cannot readily he stored, to many sections of industry and tothe Services.     In view of the strike possibilities, consideration will need to be given to the emergency arrangements needed tomaintain essential supplies, with a view to formulating a plansimilar to that for petrol supplies.      In particular the R.A.F.willprobably need to start moving the oxygen needed for their own requirements within 2h hours of the start of a strike.      The Boardof Trade have been invited to consider what emergency arrangements would be needed to meet the essential oxygen requirements of industryin the event of a strike affecting the transport of oxygen.(vii) The docks33.   A national dock strike interrupting the movement of cargothrough the ports, which normally requires a labour force of75,000, would be a clear threat to the life of the community bycreating a shortage of food or other vital commodities such asseaborne coal for power stations.     The threat would take a matterof days to materialise as individual essential commodities comeinto short supply.3k*   Government intervention would require the use of troops indocks on a substantial scale - there would be a need (which itmight not be possible to meet if strikes took place in other vitalsectors at the same time) for something like 35,000 men    to coverdock working only, of whom 3,000 would need to possess initiativeor special aptitude - to unload cargoes of foodstuffs and other essential commodities.     Port Emergency Committees would be set upin accordance with existing plans with powers to run the portsunder Government control.     They would be required at once ateleven ports or groups of ports with a normal registered dock labour force totalling about 66,000,     The repercussions of anational dock strike on food distribution e.g. at meat, fruit andfish markets, would require far more than the 35,000 troops stated.(viii) Coal35.   Provided that (a)  opencast and licensed mines continuedworking;    (b) the railways continued to operate so far as their stocks of coal and other fuels allowed;    and (c) road transportcontinued unaffected, it is anticipated that a complete strike of miners, closing all N.C.B. collieries, would have the following effect on coal supplies;-(a)    Supplies ,J.n , the &quot;pipeline&quot; .     Something like 1 to 1-g-weeks supplies at any Time are eh route to consumers.     these would arrive, but the pipeline would have to be refilled beforesupplies could begin to flow normally again at the end of the strike.(&quot;k)    Stocks at collieries and opencast sites.      Some of theformer might be lifted in spite of hostility from miners,  insofar as stocks are not actually in colliery precincts.     Sometons are held (July, 196l) by the Board away from the pits, andthere are also about i+m. tons at opencast sites.     A considerableeffort (manpower and transport) would be needed to draw upon these stocks in any useful amount,  and it must not be assumed that all of them could be made available quickly.(c)    Diversion of coal for export.     Some small gain might come by diverting for inland use coalmen route for the docks.-8-
if(a)    Opencast production would continue at about 160,000 tons per week.(e) Licensed mines production total about 40,000 tons perweek. &quot;(f) Imports might be arranged, but it would take two orthree weeks before any significant tonnage could arrive, and thereis always the risk that they may be declared &quot;black.&quot;(g) Current supplies would be dispatched so far as possibleto consumers on a priority basis, having regard to their importance and the stocks they hold.(h) Distributed stocks, including coal merchants&apos;  stocks of house coal, would normally be at their lowest towards the end ofthe winter and highest at the end of the summer.36.    But even if strike action were confined to miners, it isobvious that a strike of any duration would soon begin to affectvital services, including the railways, the power stations and the gas industry.   As mentioned earlier, power stations would be indifficulty if their stocks fell to a point at which only two weeks&apos;requirements could be met.    The gas industry, too, would be indifficulty.    In the summer, about three-quarters of the industry&apos;sgas is either made from coal or is gas bought from the coke ovens.The rest is made from oil and coke or bought as gas from the oil refineries.    Stocks of coal at gas works now average under four weeks&apos;  cover for all twelve Area Boards, those some distance fromthe coalfields holding rather more, and those on coalfields rather less.    (Stocks of oil average over 3 months&apos;  current consumption.)If coal supplies to the industry ceased, more gas could be made fromoil and, for a time, coke.   While it is possible that some Boardscould maintain gas supplies, probably et reduced pressures, forseveral weeks, others would be in serious difficulties as theircoal supply ran out in a week or two.(ix)    Gas37.    On an assumption that only wage earners and not salariedstaff such as technicians were affected, it is estimated that inorder to maintain 50% (increasing to 75$) of gas supplies, some22,000 men would be required for the first few days of a stoppagerising to 28,000 after a week or two.    These figures includerespectively totals of 10,000 and 12, 000 skilled and semi-skilled workers.38.    It is, however, thought that the requirements for skilled workers, in the sense of qualified tradesmen doing a job whichcould not be learnt in a day or two, may be much smaller than this.Moreover, the figures given above have been prepared on an assumption of an emergency in the worst possible circumstances,and since the summer demand for gas is only about two-thirds ofthat in mid-winter, the manpower envisaged would in fact maintainvirtually full supplies by normal methods in summer.    If a freshapproach could be made to the industry in consultation with theServices, it might be possible to reduce the total requirementsconsiderably, particularly those for skilled personnel, if the objective is to weather an emergency in the next few months.-9-
39.    In general, the increased use of petroleum fractions for gasmaking has reduced, and continues to reduce, the vulnerability ofthe industry to strike action.    The processes require littlemanual labour and could quite possibly be operated by supervisorystaff.    Although as yet they account for a small fraction oftotal gas supplies, their capacity is substantial in relation tosummer demand in several areas..(x)   Postal and Telecommunication services+0.    Strikes in the transport and electricity supply industries would have an immediate effect on the postal and telecommunications-tions services.    In the event of a rail transport strike,  itwould be of the utmost importance to keep open a basic minimum ofmail communications, which normally depend heavily on rail trans-port.   While the Post Office&apos;s own mail van fleet would carryout its normal functions it would be necessary to introduce atrunk network of Army and air transport services which wouldconnect with regional road services operated by hired commercial vehicles.    In the event of a road transport strike at the sametime as a rail strike, Army assistance would probably be needed for the maintenance of these regional road services.   A strike of road tanker drivers would affect the supply of fuel for mailvans and other vehicles and the Post Office would need a high priority in the allocation of fuels,   A power strike wouldinterrupt telecommunications, and the Post Office would need thehighest priority in the allocation of electricity supplies.    ThePost Office do not feel at all sure that their lower grades ofstaff, particularly engineering workmen who play a vital part in maintaining the telecommunications system, can be relied on tocontinue to work normally come what may.C.    The availability of Service manpower.4le   Existing plans for the maintenance of essential supplies and services depend largely on the availability of Services manpower.Prom what is said earlier,  it will be seen that the best estimateswe can make at the moment indicate that the numbers of men needed to maintain some of the key industries would be something of thefollowing order:-Electricity 14,000Gas 22,000 rising to 28,000Docks 35,000Oil distribution        30.000101,000 rising to 107,000It is not possible to assess the requirements likely to arise froma general transport strike, but clearly the maximum help theServices could give would be required there,  too.1+2.    The Chiefs of staff have recently re-assessed Serviceavailability and conclude that from the regular forces located inthe United Kingdom and without recalling reservist manpower;--10-
(a)   Men About 89,000, or 3k*Tfo of the total service manpower in the United. Kingdom, could beprovided to maintain essential servicesagainst the estimated requirements quoted inparagraph hi.     Of this total 6,500 menare earmarked for internal security duties in connection with the emergency.(k)   Vehicles   About 10,500 vehicles could be provided forgeneral transport within ten days.   without consulting commands they cannot estimate ifsufficient drivers would be available to match this number of vehicles.(c)   jjkjj^lsSkilled and semi-skilled manpower wouldtotal approximately 3&apos;i?000. r,,^-,,P.iLilian. Volunteer Labour1+3.    Arrangements exist for the recruitment of volunteers forthe maintenance of essential services, and for the allocation,on a system of priorities, of the labour so recruited, but itis not possible to form any estimate of the amount of helplikely to be available from this source.
