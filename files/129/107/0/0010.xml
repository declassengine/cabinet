C. (61) 160 Copy No.     4 912th October, 1961CABINETTHE MANNING SITUATION OF THE ARMY IN 1962Memorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of Statefor war at their meeting on 3rd August, 1961, the Defence Committee took note ofan emergency scheme of call-up for National Service and asked for a further reporton the manpower situation of the army.background. When the decision was taken four years ago to rely from 1963 on a voluntary army it was assumed that commitments would dimmish and that thenumber of units overseas could be reduced. The annexed table comparing thepresent deployment of the army with that projected in 1957 for the 165,000 armyshows that the opposite has occurred.Recruiting3. We still do not know for certain whether we are going to get 165,000regular recruits by January 1963. At present recruiting is going better and further measures will be taken to improve it, so that there is still hope that the targetwill be achieved.Imbalance4. Even if we achieve an army of 165,000 by the due date, however, therewill undoubtedly be serious shortages in some of the administrative corps, notablyof doctors, medical orderlies, signal operators and drivers. The army as a whole will not be an effective fighting force.The Gap5. It might be possible to accept this situation for a limited period providedthere were no serious international tension. We are obliged by treaty to keepthe British Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) at a strength of 55,000. Its present strength is 51,000 and we are under pressure from the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe, and our allies to increase it. While our long-term aim should be to reduceit to a four brigade-group basis (i.e., 40,000 men) there is clearly little chance of doing so as long as the present crisis lasts. We must therefore consider what isnecessary to prevent it from falling below its present strength, which otherwise59813THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1961
it will start to do in April 1962 when the last batches of National Servicemen will begin to leave. The present prospect is that there will be a deficiency in B.A.O.R.of 11,000-15,000 men.Long-Term Measures6. At the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer a review of overseadefence expenditure has already been put in hand. The accelerated pace at whichfcqlonial territories are achieving independence will also force us to review ouroversea commitments and the world-wide disposition of our forces. These, aredecisions which, though urgent, should not be rushed. In the long run they offer the only solution to our difficulties, but even if they were taken now they could notbe put into effect quickly enough to get us through the problems which will startto arise next spring.Measures from within oar Present Resources7. (a) From within the army. Although the main weakness of B.A.O.R.will be in the administrative services and signals, a number of fighting units willbe below strength next year. It will be possible to alleviate this to some extent bycross-posting sub-units and individuals from units elsewhere.(b) From the other Services. We must examine as a matter of urgency allpossible ways in which the other two Services can help to take the strain off thearmy. A new Rcyal Marine Commando will be raised. A study has alreadybeen put in hand of all possible means of increasing flexibility within and betweenthe three Services.Temporary Additions to Army Manpower8. The measures proposed in the foregoing paragraphs would however dolittle to fill the gap in B.A.O.R. which will start to develop next April. It is therefore necessary to consider short-term measures as well. The possibilities are as follows:(a) Call-up of the remaining age-groups who come within the existing NationalService Act.(b) A temporary extension of full-time service for National Servicemen now serving.(c) Recall of National Servicemen who have completed their full-time serviceand are now liable for     years&apos; part-time service.(d) The reconstruction of the present Reserves in such a way as to makesufficient men available for call-up in periods of tension.(e) The reintroduction de novo of National Service.These alternative courses are considered below.9. Call-up of the remaining age-groups who come within the existing NationalService Act. There are about 80,000 fit men born in the last quarter of 1939 andin 1940 who are liable for Service under the existing Act but who have been told that they will not be called up. To reverse this decision would cause an outcry,the more so as these men are now over 22, many of them married and settled in civilian life. This might have to be faced, but more serious objections are thatthey would be completely untrained and that since there would be far more ofthem than we should need, we should be confronted with difficult problems of selection.  No legislation would be required.10. Temporary extension of full-time service for National Servicemen alreadyserving. From a military point of view the simplest and most effective coursewould be to retain for an extra period of six months those National Servicemenwhose two-year period of full-time service comes to an end during the period april-October 1962. They would be fully-trained men and could for the mostpart be kept where they are. No doubt there would be some outcry but this couldbe answered by rehearsing the alternatives and by pointing out that the UnitedStates Government have done the same. In our judgment it would be wise tosoften the blow by paying them during their extra six months at the rate appropriate to three-year Regulars. The cost on this basis would be about  7-5 millions,assuming that we kept the whole number, which would be about 25,000.Legislation would be necessary but it would be short and simple.
11. Recall of National Servicemen who have completed their full-time service. A National Serviceman is liable for two years&apos; full-time service, followedby 3J years&apos; part-time service, after which he passes into the Army General Reserve.For some time now the part-time liability has not been enforced. At the materialtime there will be about 140,000 of these men, so that there would be problems of selection, but they would be admirably qualified to fill the gaps in the regular army.They would, of course, be even older than the men referred to in paragraph 9 above,and their resentment would no doubt be correspondingly greater. The cost wouldbe about the same as for paragraph 10 above. Legislation would be necessary but would not be complex.12. Re-organisation of the Reserves. Our present reserves organisationconsists of Section A of the Regular Reserve and the Army Emergency ReserveClass I (AER.I), both of which are small in numbers but can be called up withouta proclamation, and the far more numerous reserves which cannot be called up without a proclamation. The former are geared to a limited war, the latter to aglobal war. Neither is designed to help us in a period of continuing tension suchas we are experiencing at present. There appears to us to be a need in the long-term for a complete reappraisal of our reserve requirements and the organisationbest designed to meet them, and in the short term for a recasting of liabilities so asto put at our disposal a pool of men willing to be called up for a limited period ina time of tension to strengthen the regular army. A complete re-organisation of the reserves would certainly require complex legislation which would take a long timeto pass into law. As a first step, however, we might use the AER.I as a frameworkto build on, throwing it open to all arms instead of confining it to specialisedadministrative units as at present, and raising its present ceiling (which wouldrequire legislation). In our judgment it would be essential to the success of any such scheme that the bounty should be substantially raised from its present level of  65,perhaps to as much as  200. On this basis the extra cost would amount to 1 million a year for every 5,000 volunteers. A scheme on these lines would give usa reserve of men who could be drawn upon to strengthen the regular army in times of tension.13. Re-introduction of National Service. To do this would be a confessionthat our policy of relying on all-regular forces had failed. It would be highlyunpopular politically. It would make available far more men than we needed, withall the potentially explosive problems entailed in selection. It would mean theretention or reconstitution of the elaborate and costly machinery for dealing withappeals and for training the men when they were called up. Moreover, it is difficultto see how the army could ever go back on it: certainly it would strike a most damaging blow at voluntary recruiting. Legislation would, of course, be necessarybut would be quite simple. The cost, if 20,000 men were called up. would be about 1.4 millions a year.Possible Courses of Action14. It is clear that when Parliament reassembles the Government will haveto be in a position to say what they are prepared to do if circumstances make itnecessary to strengthen the army. We feel that whatever happens we shall need to take powers to keep the present National Servicemen for an extra six months,though a final decision might be deferred until January. This, however, will onlybuy us that much time and no more. We do not believe that the situation is such that the full reintroduction of National Service need now be contemplated, though of course if all else fails we shall have to face it. If, however, by this time nextyear, when even the extended National Servicemen begin to leave the army, thereis still tension and the strength of B.A.O.R. cannot be reduced, we must be in aposition to put our hands on whatever number of men would be needed to fill the gap. We believe that we should try voluntary means first. We recommendthat we should form a new section of AER.I with a higher ceiling, making it clearthat in their case we shall in future feel free to call them up in times of tension,when there is no shooting, but at the same time making their terms of service more attractive by means of increased bounties. Only if this fails should we fall backon the part-time National Servicemen. There is obviously much to be said for including in the same Bill authority both to retain the present National Servicemenand to recall the part-time National Servicemen. It should be realised, however,that this second provision would make the Bill much more controversial.
Recommendations15.   The Cabinet are invited:(a) To note the present forecasts of army strength.(b) To agree that the aim should be to reduce B.A.O.R. to a four brigade-groupbasis as soon as possible.(c) To agree that in the meantime we should take such steps as may benecessary to keep B.A.O.R. up to a strength of 51,000 after April 1962.(d) To approve legislative action to give the Secretary of State for Warpermissive powers to prolong by six months the full-time service ofthose National Servicemen who are due for release between April and october 1962, and to recall part-time National Servicemen for furtherfull-time service outside the United Kingdom up to six months.(e) To approve legislative action to reconstitute the Army Emergency ReserveClass I on the lines set out in paragraph 12.H.
