confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1961C. (61) 173 Copy No.    5531 st October, 1961CABINETTRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH Japan Memorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 3rd August the Cabinet endorsed my predecessor^proposals to remove restrictions on a range of Japanese imports and to offerincreases in quotas on other goods in the negotiations for a new trade arrangement with Japan to replace the arrangement due to expire on 30th September, 1961(C.C. (61) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3). The negotiations have now reached acritical stage and it is clear that unless we make further concessions the Japanesewill, for the first time, begin to discriminate against our exports. I have accordingly put to the Economic Policy Committee proposals which I think necessary to enable the negotiations to continue. The committee have agreed that further concessions should be made and have invited me to submit my proposals to the Cabinet.background.  Trade between the United Kingdom and Japan has developed favourablyin recent years:United Kingdom United kingdom imports from exports and japan* re-exports*(  millions)1958............      35.4 20-21959      ............      43-1 33-2I960      ............      42-1 29-1January-September 1960      ...      29-8 20-6January-September 1961      ...      31-2 33-2- . *.FIgure.s for imports from Japan include the cost of insurance and freight; the figures ofUnited Kingdom exports should be increased by about 10 per cent, to make them comparable.We have a substantial balance ( 50 millions in 1959) in our favour on invisibleaccount (largely oil). Japan has a favourable trade balance with the Colonies,taking from them about  65 millions and exporting to them  130 millions annually;but an unfavourable trade balance of about  50 millions with the Sterling area as a whole (imports in 1960 of  460 millions against exports of  410 millions).3. The Japanese market is valuable and rapidly growing. Our maincompetitors there are the United States and Germany, both of whom treatJapanese goods much more liberally than we do.4. At the outset of the negotiations the Japanese made it clear that theywould not continue to treat us as favourably as other countries unless we wentfurther in removing our discrimination against their goods than was envisaged inthe proposals approved by the Cabinet in August. They intend to take a furtherimportant step towards liberalising their own trade in December which will freeimports of a number of items of interest to our exporters, including woollen and worsted yarns, industrial sewing machines, some machine tools, duplicatingmachines, cine projectors, hearing aids, printing ink, shoe polish, metallic yarn,toothpaste and lawn-mowers. They have told us that British goods will not benefit59889b
from this measure of liberalisation unless we reciprocate by liberalising importsfrom Japan of further items, namely, sports goods, certain optical instruments,pencils, cameras, radio apparatus of all kinds, ships and boats, umbrellas, artificialpearls, mopeds and motor scooters, and cotton and rayon cloth for re-export.They have also asked for substantial increases in some of the quotas we havepeered on other items. France and Italy are being similarly treated. If we canCalcept the Japanese requests, we shall share fully in the December liberalisationand Japan will also increase certain quotas of interest to us, including the quota for woollen piece-goods.5. The Japanese threat to discriminate is certainly not bluff. Moreover, weare under obligation to take account of the fact that last year&apos;s agreement turned out much more favourably to us and less favourably to the Japanese than hadbeen expected or was intended.The New proposals. In these circumstances I now propose to improve our offers to the Japanesein the manner detailed in Annex A. Briefly, I suggest that we should put on open general Licence artificial pearls, pencils, ships and boats, umbrellas, mopeds and motor scooters, and electron microscopes, and make further increases in the quotas for a number of other items of particular interest to the Japanese. Someof these concessions will undoubtedly lead to criticisms from the industries affectedwhich will have to meet increased Japanese competition. Annex B contains notes on items to which the Economic Policy Committee wished particular attentionto be drawn.7. The removal of restrictions is not of course an irrevocable step, though we could hardly reverse it without damaging our relations with Japan and invitingretaliation against our goods. I propose to tell the Japanese that we shall have to look to them to take action to restrain their exports of the newly liberalised goodsif they threaten to disrupt the market here.8. It is difficult to estimate the effect of these proposals on our, import billbut it is unlikely to be significant. The increases in quotas approved last Augustamounted to some  4 millions; the further increases which I now propose are worth  2-6 millions but of this  1-5 millions are for cotton cloth for re-export after processing in this country; this will, of course, more than pay for itself interms of foreign exchange. The total net value of the quota increases for retained imports will therefore be about  5 millions. I cannot give an estimate of theadditional imports from Japan likely to result from the new Open General Licences.In any case, the total increase in our imports from Japan will not represent an equivalent addition to our import bill because to a considerable extent they will replace imports from other sources.9. I ask my colleagues to agree that I should put forward at this stage theproposals in Annex A. These contain no further offers on two of the items whichare most important from the Japanese point of view, namely cameras and radioequipment, and I must warn my colleagues that I may have to seek authority togo further in order to get an agreement. The agreement would be likely to runup to April next year, when the Japanese intend to make a further round of liberalisation in which we cannot expect them to allow us to participate withoutfurther compensation, even if they have found our offers on this occasion sufficientto match the benefits already received by us and due to be received on1st December.10. The alternative to making the concessions necessary to secure anagreement is that the Japanese will begin to discriminate against our exporterswhile our exporters&apos; most formidable competitors are exporting to Japan free fromrestrictions; that we shall lose promising opportunities for expanding our exporttrade; that commercial relations between our two countries will be harmed andthe prospects for the Commercial Treaty which will put them on a sound long-term basis will be seriously prejudiced. These are risks which we cannot afford to takeat a time when increased exports are a major aim of our policy.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,30th October, 1961.

ANNEX BNOTES ON PARTICULAR ITEMSClocksClocks and mechanical timing devices were originally included in our draftSensitive List, but the Cabinet agreed last year that they could be deleted subjectto the Japanese liberalising these items on their side (C.C. (60) 65th Conclusions,Minute 7). The proposal to offer a quota of  20,000 in the present tradearrangement negotiations was among those agreed by the Economic PolicyCommittee in July and endorsed by the Cabinet. The Japanese have now askedfor a quota of  100,000 but it is not proposed to offer more than  50,000, and theoffer will be restricted to  40,000 unless the Japanese are willing to provide more generous facilities for imports into Japan. The United Kingdom industry say theythink there will be a good market in Japan for types of clocks not manufacturedthere.United Kingdom imports of clocks from all sources amounted to  1 -4 millions in 1960, and domestic production is about the same. Imports are subject to a tariff of 33^ per cent, ad valorem. The industry expect a quota of an order of 50,000 for Japan and we have no reason to think it will be disruptive.Ships and BoatsThe Cabinet agreed last year that ships and boats need not be included inthe Sensitive List in connection with the Commercial Treaty, provided the Japanesethemselves liberalised imports of ships and boats (C.C. (60) 65th Conclusions,Minute 7). They have now done so, with trifling exceptions.In any case, our control has been purely nominal. Our policy has been to letshipowners buy their ships wherever they choose since otherwise they would be ata disadvantage in competing against foreign owners who could get their ships more cheaply. Although licences are required to import Japanese ships, they have inrecent years been issued whenever they have been asked for. The Ministry ofTransport are confident that United Kingdom shipowners are never likely to placemany orders with Japan, partly because of their traditional loyalty to British yards and partly because of the practical difficulties of construction in distant yards.The proposal that this nominal control should now be abolished is acceptable tothe Ministry of Transport. There is no fear that liberalisation of small boats willenable the Japanese to develop a trade in them with us.Cotton ClothThe quota for consumption in the home market is  300,000, equivalent to aboutA\ million square yards. This compares with a retention quota for Hong Kongfor 1961 of 174 million square yards, and for India and Pakistan combined of226-5 million square yards.The increase proposed in the quota for Japan of  200,000, is about 3 million square yards for a full year. Increases have however already been conceded tothe three Commonwealth countries for 1962 amounting to some 44 million square yards. Moreover, provision has been made for supplementary quotas to be grantedto the Commonwealth countries, based on the volume of imports for retentionfrom third countries, and conditioned only by the state of Lancashire&apos;s order books.In these circumstances, it would not be reasonable for Hong Kong, or the two other commonwealth countries to object to a modest increase in the quotas for Japan.(Incidentally increased imports from Japan would be taken into account in calculating any supplementary quota due to the Commonwealth countries.) the hong Kong Director of Finance (who leads the Hong Kong negotiating team toLondon in August) accepted this when the opportunity was taken to consult him onthe increase for Japan from  300,000 to  400,000 proposed at that time and it isnot considered that an increase by a further  100,000 could justify any differentreaction now.
Mopeds and ScootersThe United Kingdom industry came late into this field, well behind theContinentals, but have been making considerable efforts to catch up. They need toestablish their position more strongly and to do this against competition from theContinent. Following the liberalisation of Japanese motor-cycles last year theindustry made vigorous representations. They urged strongly that the importquota for Japanese mopeds and scooters should be retained and that quota restrictions should be reimposed on motor-cycles. Liberalisation of Japanesemopeds and scooters will therefore attract further vigorous protests from theBritish industry who will maintain that the present tariff of 22-5 per cent, is not initself sufficient protection against a determined drive on the British market by theJapanese and that they need more time in which to develop and establish theircompetitive position. While there is some force in this argument it is not considered that the threat of damage to the industry&apos;s development is such as tojustify in the circumstances withholding liberalisation.October 1961.
