Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1961C. (61) 161 Copy No.    5 313th October, 1961CABINETREPLACEMENT OF &quot; QUEEN MARY &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of TransportCunard no longer prepared to build a Queen replacementThe Cunard Company have decided that commercial prospects no longerjustify their proceeding with the construction of a new Queen type passenger vessel.Their Chairman has informed me of this decision and that they will be issuingan announcement (copy attached at Annex A) which will be released about 11 a.m.on Thursday morning next, in time for the evening papers.2. The whole basis of the Government^ offer to assist was that the cunard company (and the Chandos Committee) thought that the continuance of the express passenger service was commercially justified and that the assistance offered by the Government would enable them to compete successfully in this heavily subsided trade. I made this abundantly clear in my Second Reading Speech onthe North Atlantic Shipping Bill. I said (Hansard, 1st May, Column 915) &quot;TheGovernment (he., the previous Administration) decided to assist, provided andI said provided there were genuine commercial prospects of a successful service,and provided, also, that reasonable financial arrangements could be made withCunard. Accordingly, in the 1959 General Election Manifesto, the previous government announced that, if returned, they would support the continuation ofthe North Atlantic British express passenger service. That was the first action they took. They pledged themselves, subject to these two provisos.&quot;3. The Cunard Company&apos;s decision places them, and indeed the Government,in an embarrassing position. Those who throughout have opposed the constructionof a replacement for the Queen Mary will assert that everything they have saidhas now been proved right, and that the Company&apos;s judgment has been seriouslydefective. The performance of the Board is, in my view, open to much criticismthough they can allege, as they say in their draft Press statement, that it is the drasticfall particularly in first-class traffic by sea across the Atlantic this summer whichhas confounded their previous calculations. It is at least satisfactory that in their statement the Company accept full responsibility for their change of mind.4. In view of their decision there can I think be no question of the Governmentputting any pressure on them to continue with the replacement of the Queen Maryand the question of Government assistance accordingly lapses.5. As soon as the Cunard Company&apos;s statement is given to the Press, I would propose to have a statement ready on the lines of Annex B. I would welcome mycolleagues&apos; views as to whether this should be issued to the Press or made in theHouse.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,12th October, 1961.59823THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
ANNEX a proposed STATEMENT BY THE CUNARD STEAMSHIP COMPANY&apos; limited the plan to build a 75,000-ton express passenger ship (Q.3) originated over two years ago. Since then the North Atlantic passenger trade has becomeconsiderably less remunerative, particularly in the second half of this year. Thisfall in profits has been accentuated by disturbances in the international situation.Other factors which are having an adverse effect upon Cunard&apos;s earnings are:(a) There is a tendency for the potential first-class passenger across the north atlantic to use air travel to an increasing extent.(b) Operating costs such as ship maintenance, repairs and wages continue toincrease but cannot be offset by raising fares, in view of intensecompetition from the Air.The Directors of Cunard regret to announce that, after giving full considerationto all the factors involved, they have decided that the Company cannot place anorder for a ship of the type envisaged. This information has been conveyed toHer Majesty&apos;s Government and to the shipbuilders who submitted tenders for theQ.3. The decision to abandon the plan for the Q.3 has been reached with greatregret particularly having regard to its effect on employment in the shipbuilding industry.The full effect of increasingly adverse operating results on the North Atlantichas become apparent in the second half of this year. In consequence, the Directorshave put in hand a complete re-assessment of the Cunard services in the north atlantic and of the organisation required to operate them, of the type of vesselwhich can profitably be employed in the future, of the capital which will need tobe invested and of the profits which can be earned from the employment of suchcapital. The first object of the re-assessment will be to put an end to the losses which are now being incurred. The extent of Cunard&apos;s investment in air transport and its relation with Cunard&apos;s shipping interests will also be a vital consideration.This re-assessment on which, in view of its national importance, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will need to be fully consulted will necessarily take several months and a further statement will be made to stockholders at the earliest possible date.The Directors wish to make it clear that no changes are contemplated in the passenger services and cruises as at present advertised.When the full trading results of Cunard for 1961 are available they will showa heavy loss. Losses have been, and still are being, incurred by two subsidiaries,Cunard Eagle Airways Limited and Thos. &amp; Jno. Brocklebank Limited, bothof which companies have faced adverse trading conditions during the current year.While other subsidiaries have operated profitably, the Group&apos;s operations for 1961will result in a substantial overall loss.It is the Directors&apos; intention to pay the Preference dividends on the due datebut, as indicated above, it is clear that the results of the present year&apos;s trading willnot in themselves justify an Ordinary dividend. As part of the review the board will give consideration to the large capital resources available to the Group andin the light of their conclusions will decide whether they cart recommend that any form of distribution to stockholders be made out of reserves accumulated in earlier years.October 1961.
PROPOSED GOVERNMENT statement the Government have been informed by the Cunard Company that theprospects for the North Atlantic express passenger service have deteriorated somuch in recent months that in their judgment the construction of a replacementfor the Queen Mary is no longer justified, and that, in these circumstances, theyhave decided not to proceed with placing an order.The purpose of the Government in offering assistance to the Cunard Company,as authorised by the North Atlantic Shipping Act, was to enable them to carryout their intention to provide an express service which could compete with theheavily subsidised services provided by their foreign competitors on this route. Inview of Cunard&apos;s decision, the question of Government assistance no longer arises.October 1961.ANNEX B
