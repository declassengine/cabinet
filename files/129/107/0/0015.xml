C. (61) 16524th October, 1961CABINETMETHANE GASMemorandum, by the Secretary of Statefor the Home DepartmentFollowing the discussion in the Cabinet on 9th October of the gas council s proposal to import liquid methane (C. C. (6l) 54th Conclusions,Minute 2) I was asked by the Prime Minister to hold a small meeting ofMinisters to give further consideration to the arguments for and againstthe proposal.   The meeting, to which I invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the Minister of Education, the Minister without Portfolio, the Ministerof Power and the President of the Board of Trade, has now taken place.The issues of principle2.      The application raises two issues of principle.   First, it is theGovernments.policy to give the nationalised industries the greatest possible commercial freedom consistent with their other obligations.   Thispolicy formed the basis of the White Paper on the Financial and EconomicObligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337) which was published as recently as April this year.   The Paper indicates that it is only byletting these industries take responsibility in matters of commercial judgment that we can hope to get good management and so a reductionin their dependence on Exchequer financing.   If we refuse this application,we shall appear to be undermining the policy so recently announced.In the event of refusal we also foresee the likelihood of Parliamentarydifficulties especially from those of our supporters who are anxious to seethe nationalised industries put on a more businesslike footing.3.      The second: major issue of principle arises from our policy towardsimports.    It has been our policy since 1951 to give industry freedom to import the raw materials it needs.   Private industry is free to importmethane in any quantity it wishes.   Can we refuse the same freedom tothe gas industry, particularly when their aim is to achieve a substantial reduction in costs ?Balance of Payments4.     Since the Cabinet&apos;s last discussion, the Minister of Power has again seen the Chairman of the Gas Council and has put to him. some of the doubts which have been expressed about the proposal.   As a result, we nowknow what the alternative is likely to be.   If we refuse the methane applica -tion, the Area Gas Boards will want, in order to keep costs down, to import increased quantities of petroleum products, principally propaneand butane.   Taking low prices at the port of shipment, and allowing forthe probable foreign element in the freight compared with methane, the copy NO.\6-i-CONFlDENTlAL(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
foreign exchange cost, if propane and butane were used, could hardly beless and would probably be a little more than that for methane.   We should find it very difficult indeed to deny to the gas industry this developmentof their existing programmes for using petroleum products.   The questiontherefore is not whether we can protect our balance of payments by denyingmethane to the gas industry.   The question is whether the inevitable foreign exchange cost, necessary if an advance towards cheaper gas is to be made,should be spread over methane and oil or allotted to oil only.Other points of difficulty5.      We have considered carefully the various other doubts about theproposal which have been expressed:-(a) Security of investment the whole of the gas industry&apos;s investment * wouldbe in installations and pipelines in the United Kingdom which could be used for other gases.There would be no public money at risk in Algeria.   There would also be some British investment (but not of public money) in the tankers, but againthere would be no great difficulty i n finding alternative uses for the tankersif necessary.(b) Security of SuppliesThere is, of course, a possibility, in view of the extremely unstablepolitical situation in Algeria, that supplies of methane might be interrupted.The gas industry have taken account of this possibility and have prepared plan?to meet it.   If the interruption took place during the early years of the schemethey would introduce alternative petroleum based gases.   In the longer term they expect to be able to make use of alternative sources of methanein Nigeria, Libya and the Western Hemisphere.(c) Nigeria as an alternative sourceIf the scheme goes forward the industry will want to see alternative sources of methane exploited.   One promising alternative is Nigeria.   Butthis could not be ready for some years after the Algerian scheme and longnegotiations would be necessary before the economics of the scheme couldbe worked out.conclusion.      The existing coal carbonisation plants are becoming increasinglyuneconomic because of the rising price of coal.   But gas is still the bestfuel for many industrial uses, and there is a wide and continuing demandfor it.   In these circumstances, the gas industry are rightly seeking new techniques to provide gas more efficiently.7.      Treasury Ministers are satisfied that there is a good case,on economic and financial grounds, for the methane project.   In addition,methane has many technical advantages over other gas-making materials.Like any other new venture, it is not without its risks, and it involvessubstantial capital and foreign   exchange eexpenditure.   But the opportunitiesit offers are so great, and the return on capital so attractive, that we-2-CONFI DENTS AL
consider that taking these risks would be justified.   Moreover, we seegreat difficulty in disregarding the commercial judgment of the Gas Councilin this matter.8.      We therefore recommend that the Minister of Power shouldapprove the scheme and announce his 1 decision in Parliament as soon aspossible.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W. 1.24th October, 1961-3-CONFIDENTIAL
