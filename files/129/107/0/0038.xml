THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 18820th November, 1961CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN GREATER london memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i would like to put to the Cabinet some general reflections and commentsarising out of C. (61) 185 and the draft White Paper.1. I share the view that the Report of the Commission should be implemented,with the amendments envisaged in the White Paper.2. The Report of the Commission has found a wide measure of acceptance,but there will of course be opposition to it, and this opposition will not be confined to our political opponents.(a) In London the scheme will be generally acceptable to Conservativeleaders, but in some places there will be opposition because of detailsof the borough organisation. More important perhaps those in central london will not all favour the new proposals for a large centraleducational authority. I think it is a good suggestion that the area should differ from the present London County Council area, but I suppose it remains probable that we will here reproduce in the mostvital of all local government functions the pattern of control of theLondon County Council at present.(b) In Middlesex the scheme will be generally acceptable to constituencies,though not of course to the Middlesex County Council, whichdisappears.(c) In Surrey there will be general opposition from Conservatives with localgovernment responsibilities; and from some, but not all, constituencies.Some people outside London have grave doubts whether the new Surreylocal government area will be viable.id) In Kent much as Surrey,(e) In Essex no reports of substantial opposition.(/) Opinions up to now have crystallised on the basis of the boroughs set outin the Report of the Royal Commission. There may be some differentfeelings about the larger boroughs now proposed, but these feelings arelikely to be confined in the main to borough councillors.3.   I have two amendments to the draft White Paper to suggest.(a) When the Cabinet discussed the matter in the summer, I expressed grave doubts about the destruction of county loyalties and other ties(C.C. (61) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6). I am a good deal reassured tofind that some of the anxieties I expressed are not well founded although as the White Paper recognises-^there will be some disturbance. This,I think, can be largely met by an addition to the White Paper in whichI suggest it should be stated that this is a local government reorganisationonly, and this reorganisation need not destroy the historical ties andtraditions which exist within geographical counties. It need not affectthe administration of justice, the lieutenancy or the territorial basis onwhich Sheriffs are appointed: postal addresses can still include the copy No.5560005
geographical county as at present, and need not be &quot; LONDON &quot; and&apos; the number of a postal district. The local affiliations of Army regimentsand local supporting loyalties can remain unimpaired. County cricketcan go on as now. The Greater London Council would have anywayin theory as little effect on all these as has the Metropolitan Water board or the Metropolitan Police Authority. If I am right in the assumptionsI have made in this paragraph, then clearly we should answer theseanxieties in the White Paper.(b) The second amendment I would like to suggest arises out of paragraph 56of the draft White Paper where the dates are given by which it isintended that the operation shall be completed. It would avoid doubtand difficulty if it could be stated that no local government elections for any part of the area to be covered by the Greater London council will be held after May 1962, i.e., three years before the take-over date,and that authority will be given for existing councillors to continue toserve until the take-over date.I. M.Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,20th November, 1961.
