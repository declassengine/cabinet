THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1961C. (61) 201 Copy No.     5 81st December, 1961CABINETBRITISH EMIGRATION policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts, 1922-57, which are thevisible symbol of British emigration policy, expire on 31st May, 1962; and theUnited Kingdom-Australia Assisted Passage Scheme, our contribution to whichis made under the Acts, on 31st March next. To advise me on our long-termemigration policy in the light of the coming expiry of the Acts and Scheme, Iappointed an Interdepartmental Committee of Officials. Their Report is annexed :it contains agreed recommendations except that the Treasury position is reservedon the financial aspects.2. I agree generally with the Committee^ recommendations, which are summarised at paragraph (V) of the Report.3. It is clear that Australia, which is the only other commonwealth government to whose migration scheme we make a direct financial contribution,attaches great importance to our continued participation in their Assisted PassageScheme. Australia considers it essential both to increase her population and tomaintain the preponderance of people of British stock. Indeed, she regards ourpresent annual contribution to the existing Scheme of  150,000 per annum(4 per cent, of the total cost) as inadequate, and has indicated that  750,000 perannum would be in scale with contributions from other European countriestowards the passage costs of their migrants to Australia. While our present financial difficulties clearly rule out a contribution of this order, I consider it important to our political relations with Australia that we should both offer tonegotiate a fresh five-year agreement as from 31st March, 1962, and substantially to increase our contribution to the Scheme. An annual figure of  300,000 wouldin my view be justified. We should, at the same time, have to make it clear tothe Australian Government as well as to other Commonwealth Governmentsseeking emigrants from this country, that it will be necessary for us to keep a close watch on the effects of migration on the skilled and professional manpowerresources of this country, and that we must continue to reserve the right to askreceiving Governments at any time to co-operate in refraining from recruitingskilled people from sectors of our economy where they may be in short supply.4. The Report also draws attention to child migration. This is now steadilydeclining. But the voluntary societies working in this field still depend oncontributions from the British and Australian Governments to help in meeting the costs of children who have emigrated. I would hope in return for a substantial increase in our contribution to the Assisted Passage Scheme, and, subject to satisfactory safeguards for the welfare of the children, to persuade the australian government to take over responsibility for all existing child migration subventions.Should they refuse, the only alternative would be to renew the present schemeswith the voluntary societies with some modest increase in the rate of themaintenance allowance to compensate for increased costs. I calculate that thiswould involve increased expenditure over the next three years of the order of 23,000.60039
5.   I, therefore, recommend to my colleagues that:(a) They should authorise  the introduction  of  a Bill  to extend  theCommonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts for a further five yearsuntil 31st May, 1967, the limit of  1^ millions on annual expenditurenamed in the Acts being reduced to the more realistic figure of  750,000.(b) The Bill should be passed into law before 31st March, 1962, in order thatthe Assisted Passage Scheme with Australia may be renewed thereunderby that date.(c) Under the renewed Assisted Passage Scheme, which would run for a furtherfive years until 31st March, 1967, we should make an annual contribution of  300,000.(d) In the absence of satisfactory alternative arrangements, the agreement withvoluntary societies concerned with child migration should be renewedfor a further three years until 31st May, 1965.6. The annual increase in costs involved in these recommendations wouldbe of the order of  175,000 per annum.D. S.Commonwealth Relations Office,29th November, 1961.
BRITISH EMIGRATION POLICYREPORT BY INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE OF OFFICIALSSummary and recommendations we were appointed by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations&quot; to review long-term emigration policy and to make recommendations in viewof the expiry of the Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts on the 31st May,1962 &quot;.(ii) Our Committee consisted of representatives of the Treasury, the HomeOffice, the Commonwealth Relations Office, and the Ministries of Aviation, Labourand Transport. In preparing our report we have sought advice from the british high Commissioners concerned as well as from the Board of Trade, the Ministriesof Health and Education (and their Scottish counterparts), the Office of the Ministerfor Science and the Scottish Home Department. We have had at our disposal thereports of previous interdepartmental committees and of the Oversea MigrationBoard. We have paid particular attention to the recommendations made by theBoard this year.Summary(iii) In recent years about 80 per cent, of British emigration to theCommonwealth has been to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa andthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. We consider foreign countries to be generally outside our terms of reference. South Africa, having withdrawn fromthe Commonwealth, is now ineligible to participate in any further scheme under theCommonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts.(iv) Our report is accordingly concerned with emigration to Canada, Australia,New Zealand and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland; and, chiefly becauseof growing competition for skilled manpower, we have thought it best not to lookfurther ahead than five years from the 1st June, 1962. While we have consideredemigration as a general question of policy affecting all these countries, we havegiven our attention to particular incentives only in relation to Australia, which alone participates in a scheme under the Acts.Recommendations(v) In the subsequent sections of this report we have considered the various aspects of emigration under five headings. Our recommendations under eachheading are summarised below:I. British Emigration Policy and the Commonwealth and Empire SettlementActs(a) The Government should continue the existing policy ofcollaborating with Commonwealth Governments in theirimmigration policies. We add the rider that it may soon prove necessary to exercise more frequently our right to askCommonwealth countries not to recruit skilled workers in short supply in this country (paragraph 29).(h) The Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts should be renewed for a further period of five years (paragraph 30).(c) The amending Bill should reduce the present unrealistic upper limit on annual expenditure from  1,500,000 to  750,000(paragraph 34).
II. The United Kingdom-Australia Assisted Passage Agreement(a) The Agreement, which expires on 31st March, 1962, should beextended for a further period of five years (paragraph 44).(b) The British contribution should be increased from  150,000 perannum to  300,000 per annum (the Treasury representativereserves his position) (paragraph 51);.Ill-Child Migration to Australia(a) If the British contribution to the Assisted: Passage Scheme is increased as proposed in sub-paragraph II (b) above, theAustralian Government should be asked to take over responsibility for the outfit and maintenance allowances paidby Britain, subject to our retaining adequate safeguards for the welfare of migrant children (paragraphs 58-60).(b) If this proposal is unacceptable to the Australian Government,the existing agreements with the societies should be renewed,for three years in the first instance, and the maintenenceallowance increased from 10s. to  1 per week for each child.The additional cost may be of the order of  23,000 over thenext three years (paragraph 60).TV-Policy towards Voluntary Emigration Organisations(a) Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women. The questionwhether the existing Government grant of  10,000 per annumshould continue after the 31st December, 1962, should be reviewed not later than July 1962 (paragraph 68).(b) Big Brother Movement. The existing grant, fixed in 1955, of 2 10s. Od. in respect of each youth, and the limit of expenditureof  1,000 per annum, should be increased to  5 and  2,000respectively (paragraph 76).(c) Church of England Council for Commonwealth Settlement. Nofurther grants in respect of adult emigration should be made(paragraph 82).V. Housing Schemes for British Emigrants(a) No action should be taken to bring schemes for emigrant housingwithin the terms of the Commonwealth and Empire SettlementActs (paragraph 95 (a)).(b) No amendment should be made  to  the  existing  legislationregulating overseas investment by.British building societies. Thequestion whether they should, within the limits permitted, investin emigrant housing is not, we consider, within our terms ofreference (paragraph 95 (b)).(c) We do not consider it within our terms of reference to make a recommendation about the overseas, investment of Britishlending institutions&apos; funds, (paragraph 95 (c)).    .j.

&apos; SECTION IGENERAL POLICY AND THE QUESTION OF RENEWING THE&apos;    COMMONWEALTH AND EMPIRE SETTLEMENT ACTS. 1. An individuals, decision to emigrate must be voluntary. There can beno question either of coercion or of prevention by the Government. TheGovernment can actively encourage or discourage emigration or they cancollaborate with those who initiate it. The question is what the government&apos;s policy should be within those limits.background. The Imperial Conference of 1921 urged Britain to &quot;co-operate withoversea Governments in a comprehensive policy of Empire Land Settlement and empire-directed migration &quot; and to &quot; secure the necessary powers . . . preferably in the form of an Act which would make it clear that the policy of co-operationnow adopted is intended to be permanent &quot;. Successive Acts of Parliament,beginning with the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, have since empowered theSecretary of State to co-operate with oversea Governments, public and privateorganisations on agreed migration schemes. The British contribution to those schemes has been limited to half the total cost (increased in certain cases to 75 per&apos;cent. under the terms Of the 1937 Act) and to an aggregate annual expenditure of 3 million, reduced by the same Act to  1^ million). (A copy, of the 1922 Act anda summary of subsequent amendments are at Annex B.)3. The scale of British financial aid to migration and the schemes to whichit has been applied have varied over the past 40 years according to economic and social conditions in the sending and receiving countries. Between 1922 and 1933many types of scheme were initiated at a total cOst to the British Government ofover  6 million. The introduction of State planning and of financial aid for overseas settlement undoubtedly smoothed the path for many emigrants&apos; andhelped their assimilation. But the world economic depression of the early 1930sreduced emigration from this country to negligible proportions.4. Since the Second World War the Governments financial aid to emigrationhas been restricted to the resettlement of ex-service men and women overseas:to the United Kingdom-Australia Assisted Passage Scheme; and to support forcertain voluntary societies dealing with adult and child migration. During thisperiod Britain has provided 34 per cent, of the 4 - 43 million new settlers absorbed by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland. Over the same period the British Government have spent some 7-J million on assistance to migration in all forms.5. The figures of movements from Britain to the main receivingCommonwealth countries, given in Annex A, are derived from Commonwealthsources and for the reasons; set out in Appendix I represent the best estimateavailable since they include all arrivals. Existing British emigration statistics are confined to departures by the long sea routes and there are indications that thearrangements for collecting them may shortly come to an end. No comparablestatistics exist of air travel, which now accounts for about a quarter of the traffic and is increasingly preferred by professional people. Later in this report we stressBritain&apos;s skilled manpower needs and the importance of watching our losses incertain categories. Commonwealth countries publish occupational statistics oftheir immigrants but in forms which make it difficult for us accurately to assess the effect on our, labour force. While we draw attention to these statisticalshortcomings and have noted the views of the Oversea Migration Board set outin Annex E we conclude that it is not within our terms of reference to suggest a remedy.6. The Inter-Departmental Committee of 1956 had before it the following recommendation, made: by the Oversea Migration Board in their Second Reportarid accepted by the Government, that: &quot; The United Kingdom should continue td,encourage migration to other parts of the Commonwealth provided that there was
no radical change in the composition of those migrating according to age, sex, and occupation or in the economic position of the country; and that this encouragementshould include financial assistance to the extent that provision can be made in thepresent circumstances &quot;..7. The Committee concluded that &quot; to abandon the policy of encouragingemigration . . . would need to be justified by strong reasons which do not exist.To continue it would be in the broad interests of the United Kingdom and inharmony with the policies of the other Commonwealth Governments in question &quot;.They, therefore, recommend inter alia that:(a) The policy of giving facilities for recruitment of emigrants by other commonwealth Governments, and of giving general encouragement to emigration to other Commonwealth countries, should be continued.It might, as before, be necessary on occasion to ask individualCommonwealth Governments to restrict their recruiting activities inparticular occupations or areas.(b) The Empire Settlement Acts should be renewed and should retain an upper limit on expenditure of f 1^- million.These recommendations were accepted by the Government and the Acts wererenewed for five years ending 31st May, 1962.Policy of Receiving Countries8. The four main Commonwealth countries of settlement are all, to varyingextents, still keen to obtain new British settlers and have established migrationoffices here. The only country to whose immigration schemes the BritishGovernment pays any financial contribution is Australia.9. In Canada, immigration policy is politically delicate because of conflict between the interests of employers and labour, French and English Canadians,established groups and newcomers. But increasing automation, the naturalpopulation growth since the war, seasonal unemployment and a slowing down ofeconomic expansion are factors likely to make the Canadian Government takefewer immigrants in future. They want skilled workers and professional people,especially as there is a steady loss of such people from Canada to the United States.The Federal and Provincial Governments help selected immigrants with loans but so far have been against immigration subsidised by other Governments. In recentyears the annual flow from Britain to Canada has been about 20,000. A high proportion of immigrants is still likely to come from this country.10. Australia considers it essential to build up her population not only for internal development, but also as a defence against any threat of territorialexpansion from Asia. Both major political parties pursue an energetic immigration policy based on keeping Australia &quot; white&quot;. While recent anti-inflationary measures taken by the Australian Government have resulted in a temporaryreduction of immigration, the declared policy is to increase the existing populationof 10J million by 1 per cent, per annum through immigration alone and to look to britain for a substantial proportion of migrants. Particular importance is attachedby the Australians to continued British participation in the Assisted Passage Scheme.The present annual flow of British migrants to Australia is 43,000 of whom 33,000travel under the Scheme.11. New Zealand has a Free Passage Scheme for selected categories, which her Government hope to expand so far as finance and housing permit. The average annual flow from Britain is 11,000 of whom about a third travel under the free passage Scheme.12. Although the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (in terms ofemigration from Britain this means Southern Rhodesia) is rich in natural resources,it lacks sufficient capital, managerial capacity and skilled labour for developmentpurposes. Immigration policy is, therefore, based on the selection of people to fill known requirements. At present political uncertainties tend to curb economic expansion and so the rate at which immigrants can be absorbed; but the Federationintends to continue her policy of securing the majority of settlers from British stock.The present annual flow from Britain is about 3,500.
Economic Advantages of Emigration16. Emigration from Britain to other Commonwealth countries brings certaindirect economic advantages to this country. Their value cannot be closelyestimated, but we believe they are considerable. Thus, the immigrant helps tomaintain or increase the demand in the new country for British goods and services,and he (or possibly his descendants) will sometimes return to Britain to spendmoney here as a tourist. In addition, British air and shipping interests derivesubstantial gross revenue from emigration, particularly on the route to australia for which British ship owners have made large investments in new ships since thewar.Economic Disadvantages of Emigration17. Commonwealth countries try to attract skilled workers under the age of45; as a result, this country loses people on whom much has been spent by way ofeducation, training and social services. The following paragraphs consider theeffect on our economy of the emigration of four categories of skilled people, namely,skilled workers below professional level, scientists and technologists, teachers,doctors and nurses.18. Persistent shortages of skilled workers are increasingly a source of concern,particularly in the engineering and building industries. These shortages hamper the efficient working of the economy out of all proportion to the numbers involved.While there is no doubt some &quot; gain &quot; from immigration, it is doubtful how far this can properly be set against the &quot; loss &quot; and there are certain skilled occupations examples are draughtsmen, turners, toolroom fitters, carpenters and bricklayers inwhich all losses by emigration, however small the numbers, are unfortunate.19. Many of the British scientists and technologists who emigrate travel toincrease their education and experience and return to this country with considerable advantage to us. Apart from these, a number immigrate from other commonwealth countries. There are grounds for believing that the shortage of scientists andtechnologists will become less acute in most branches in the next few years. TheOffice of the Minister for Science see no objection to continuing encouragement and assistance to emigration at the present level, although they doubt whether thiswould make any critical difference in the case of scientists and technologists. On theother hand, they would be opposed to encouraging- emigration still more by increasing our financial contributions.20. The Education Departments draw attention to the continued serious shortage of teachers in this country, despite efforts to remedy the situation.  TheNew Factors13. A significant change has taken place in recent years in the character of migration from this country. No longer are the majority of migrants unskilledlabourers of the type who constituted an unemployment problem in Britain in the1920s. The modern trend is towards professional and skilled workers, urgentlysought by the white Commonwealth countries to develop their economies. But withthe needs of our own expanding economy and with our increasing obligation toprovide technical assistance to developing Commonwealth countries these people are also wanted here. There is thus a growing competition for skill between the sending and receiving countries. This is an essential factor to be taken into account in framing future emigration policy.14. Another new feature has been the emphasis placed on the ancillarycharacter of the British Government^ role in emigration. This view was givenmost recent expression by the Duke of Devonshire on 21st December, 1960, inthe House of Lords: &quot;... it is the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that the formulation of plans for maintaining the flow of migrants from the United kingdom to other Commonwealth countries is primarily a matter for the receiving countries,and in those plans Her Majesty&apos;s Government are very glad to collaborate . . . &quot;.15. If, in the past, greater emphasis was placed on the needs of the whiteCommonwealth, there is now reason for Britain shaping her future emigrationpolicy primarily in the light of her own interests. These are to maintain a buoyanteconomy; and to maintain and develop her links with the other countries of theCommonwealth.
Political Disadvantages; 23. The economic factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are not without political importance. Acquiescence in the continued loss of skilledmanpower is at some variance with the need to secure public acceptance of thenecessity for higher production with ever higher technical achievements, in orderthat Britain&apos;s economy may both expand and support the growing burden of social services. A further essential home policy:; is to convince the country of the paramount need to produce and sell more abroad; an announcement that continuedsupport was being given to emigration and that more money would be provided to encourage schemes leading to manpower losses might be hard to reconcile withthis.&apos; ,&apos; 24. On the external side, moreover, any diminution in our ability to providetechnical assistance to developing countries reduces the effectiveness of the partwe can play in the United Nations and its various agencies. Indeed in some commonwealth countries our inability to provide experts under bilateral agreementsis already the subject of recrimination and of hints that the Soviet bloc would bemore ready to help.Political Advantages25. Emigration strengthens Commonwealth ties and co-operation. Peopleof British stock in other Commonwealth countries can influence political development as Voters, as Members of Parliament and as Ministers. Any lesseningof our encouragement of emigration would be taken in Australia, and perhapselsewhere, as an indication that we were not interested in maintaining those tiesor in helping them to cope with their problems of manpower and defence.26. Our emigration policy is particularly important in relation to Australia,the only country with which we have an agreement under which we contribute towards the passage costs of emigrants and the maintenance of child migrants.Moreover, Australian public opinion is particularly sensitive to changes in Britishemigration policy.27. The Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts have, for long, beenthe symbol of the British Governmenfs policy of encouraging emigration to theCommonwealth. To allow.them to lapse, little though they have been used inrecent years, would cause grave concern to the Australian Government. It wouldalso stimulate pressure groups in this country; such as the Commonwealth MigrationCouncil, to organise protests to the Government. Although such reactions mightbe to some extent discounted, it would not be prudent to ignore the many people in this country who hold, strong and sincere convictions1 of the importance ofBritish emigration. A decision to allow the Acts to lapse would be likely to causesuch people deep concern, though the effect might be mitigated by an accompanyingMinisterial statement that the decision did not signify any radical change in the government&apos;s attitude towards emigration. ;Government is also committed to assist in filling by 1965 another 400 key posts in developing Commonwealth countries., The Departments would not wish tosee the emigration of teachers to the &quot; old &quot;Commonwealth countries encouraged to any greater extent than at present; in. their view these countries should try to stand on their own feet educationally so that first attention can be given to themore urgent requirements of the developing countries.21. The Health Departments have also drawn attention to the need for doctors and nurses in developing Commonwealth countries and to the government&apos;s policy in this respect. The numbers emigrating to the &quot; old &quot; Commonwealthare, however, relatively small and the loss is partly balanced by immigration. the health Departments have raised no objection to the current encouragement ofemigration, nor would they object to it continuing.22. These categories apart, we are aware of shortages in certain professions,including the law, surveying and accountancy, many candidates for which emigrateand qualify overseas. The majority do not return, and this represents a potentialloss where the shortage here is acute. .;
ItSummary and Recommendations28. Neither the, advantages nor the disadvantages of emigration to our economy can be precisely assessed, but there are now signs that the balance is beginning to work adversely. The internal political consequences also appear tobe adverse. The balance of external political factors, on the other hand, favourscontinuation of bur policy of encouraging emigration. Having particular regardto our relations with Australia, which for wider reasons are at present under some strain, these latter factors may well be considered overriding.29. While it will be necessary to keep a Close watch on the extent to whichthe emigration of skilled manpower hampers our economy, its capacity for growth,and our ability to meet the requirements of the developing countries of theCommonwealth, we have come to the conclusion that the Government shouldcontinue their present policy of collaborating with; Commonwealth governments in their immigration policies. It would follow from this that the commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts should be renewed for five years. We add the riderthat it may soon prove necessary to exercise more frequently our right to askCommonwealth countries not to recruit skilled workers in short supply in thiscountry.30. We accordingly recommend that a Bill to renew the Acts for five years should be introduced in the 1961-62 Parliamentary Session in time for it toreceive the Royal Assent before the 31st March, 1962, when the current UnitedKinadom-Australia Assisted Passage Agreement expires.Terms of the Proposed Bill31. We have considered whether the opportunity should be taken to tidy upthe Acts of 1922 and 1937 by removing provisions which are no longer needed,for example for land settlement schemes. But changes of this kind are not essential and might be misunderstood overseas, and we recommend that the Bill to beintroduced should be in the simplest terms.32. There is, however, one amendment which we consider should be made*namely to the figure given as the annual upper limit on expenditure,  \\ million.This figure was put into the 1937 Act as a realistic estimate of the maximum amount that would be required for the scale of British emigration and the degreeof British participation envisaged at the time. By 1952 the figure bore no relationto what was likely to be spent, but was retained in the 1952 and 1957 Acts onthe grounds that any downward change would provoke criticism.33. It would be misleading Parliament now to ask it to legislate for a sumgreatly in excess of what is likely to be spent. It would not be in line with thepresent Governments measures to bring Parliamentary estimating and accountingprocedures up-to-date and make them more realistic. A subsidiary advantage ofinserting a revised figure is that there continues to be a misunderstanding, bothinside and outside Parliament, that the figure laid down in the Acts represents the sum annually voted for emigration expenditure; this misconception of theposition continually prompts questions why the funds available have not been used and allowed to lapse. &quot;&apos;.34. The 1956 Inter-Departmental Committee recommended by a majoritythe continuance of  Ljf million as the upper limit on the basis of an Act with a15-year life and no increased expenditure. If our recommendations are now accepted for an Act to run for five years, with an increase in annual expenditure(as to which see Sections II and III) we think there could be no serious criticism,in this country or overseas, that the Government were unsympathetic to emigration.Accordingly, we recommend that the upper limit on expenditure should be 750,000 per annum and that the 1937 Act be so amended. We have arrived atthis figure by taking as a basis our recommendations for future expenditure and adding a margin to provide for any new scheme which might be proposed by a commonwealth Government.
SECTION IITHE ASSISTED PASSAGE SCHEME TO AUSTRALIABackground35. The Assisted Passage Scheme provides for the grant of passages from britain to migrants selected by the Australian authorities, who arrange for theirtravelling, reception, employment and after-care in Australia. It is embodied inan Agreement, which expires on 31st March 1962, between the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations and the Australian Government under the terms ofthe Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts. The Agreement provides for joint approval by both Governments of applications for passages.36. The first post-war Agreement in 1946 provided that emigrants should contribute towards passage costs as follows:Initially the remaining costs were shared equally by the two Governments. By1950-51 the British contribution had risen to  885,000, and owing to the pressingneed for economy the Government (with the concurrence of the australian government) placed a maximum of  500,000 on its expenditure in the following year. In 1952-53 this was further reduced to a fixed annual payment of  150,000,at which level it has remained. The Australian Government increased theirpayment proportionately, and in 1958 also assumed the  5 charge for emigrantsbetween 14 and 19 years.37. The Inter-Departmental Committee of 1956 considered that it was in britain&apos;s interest to have a population of British-minded Australians and to buildup Australian military and industrial potential. It accepted that the british contribution to the Scheme, though only a small proportion of the total cost, was important as a token of the Governments friendly interest in Australianimmigration policy. After considering whether this interest could be expressedin some other way than by an annual payment towards passage costs, e.g., byinvestment in housing or schools, and being unable to suggest a practicable alternative, the Committee recommended renewal of the Agreement, if theAustralian Government wished to continue it, and that the British Governmentshould be prepared to renew their contribution of  150,000 per annum. these recommendations were accepted, and implemented.38. From April 1947 to March 1961, 341,047 people emigrated under theScheme at a cost to the Australian Government of over  36 million; the british governments expenditure has been over  3,800,000. A copy of the currentAgreement, and detailed statistics of post-war migration to Australia, are atAnnexes C and D.Developments Since .195639. The Scheme is generally limited to people under 45 who have been&quot; nominated&quot; by individuals or organisations in Australia, or by theCommonwealth Government. The latter have instituted a number of measuresbased on the Scheme to stimulate movements :(a) Local communities in Australia have been encouraged to &quot; nominate &quot;emigrants who cannot otherwise obtain sponsors (&quot; Bring out a Briton &quot;Scheme).(b) Nomination requirements have been relaxed for(i) the &quot; self-reliant&quot; single emigrant with a minimum of  25 at his disposal on landing in Australia; and(ii) the emigrant who has at least  500 towards the purchase of a house (the &quot; Nest Egg&quot; Scheme).(c) The  5 contribution from emigrants of 14 to 19 years has been abolished.(d) Assisted passages by air, at no extra cost to the emigrant, have been introduced.(e) Migration offices have been opened in Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast and birmingham.19 years or over ...14-19 years under 14 years  ... 10 no charge
40. During each of the past five years movements under the Scheme haveincreased by some 3,000 and are now about 33,000 per annum (unassistedemigration is at present approximately 10,000 per annum). As a result of recentemployment difficulties in Australia, preference is being given at the present timeto applicants who are skilled workers or the dependants of immigrants already inAustralia, but the annual rate is unlikely to decline.41. The Oversea Migration Board have recently recommended (see Annex E)that the Assisted Passage Agreement should be renewed in 1962 and that&quot; consideration should be given to an increase in the (British) token grant of 150,000 per annum, with a view to increasing the total resources available forassisted passages &quot;.42. We have already drawn attention in paragraph 13 to the needs for expansion of the British economy and of our increasing commitments to developing countries which have placed additional strain on our manpower resources. we recognise that the Scheme results in some loss of skilled and professional people.Furthermore, the low cost of travel to the individual provides an obvious incentive to emigrate. We recognise that Britain&apos;s contribution has a negligible effect onthe numbers travelling under the Scheme and consequently on our loss of manpower; emigration to Australia would probably continue on the same scalewhether or not we participated in a scheme. On the other hand, british participation allows some influence over emigrant recruitment from sensitivesectors of our economy.43. As to the political factors, there can be no doubt that Australia regardsBritish participation in the Scheme as an earnest of our interest in her development.Sir Tasman Heyes, Secretary of the Australian Immigration Department, came tothis country last May expressly to try to negotiate a renewal of the agreement and to secure a larger British contribution to the costs. Failure to renew theAgreement would be sharply resented and might adversely affect Anglo-Australianrelations in other spheres where understanding and co-operation are essential atthe present time.44. Here again the political considerations are paramount; it is important to demonstrate Britain&apos;s continuing interest in Australia^ future development. Wetherefore recommend that the Assisted Passage Agreement should be extended fora further period of five years from 31st March, 1962, after which time the balanceof factors will need to be reassessed.Terms of fee Agreement45. If the foregoing recommendation is accepted the question arises of britain&apos;s contribution. The present annual cost of the Scheme is approximately 4 million of which this country pays  150,000 or 4 per cent. The australian government, who pay the rest (apart from the migrants small contribution),regard our present share as quite inadequate and out of keeping with the spiritof partnership which such schemes imply. Sir Tasman Heyes has suggested 750,000 as a British contribution which would be in scale with contributions madeby other European Governments towards the passage costs per head of theiremigrants going to Australia; this figure is known to have the approval ofMr. Downer, the Australian Minister of Immigration. A contribution of this order would represent 19 per cent, of the present costs of the Scheme.46. There is evidence to suggest that earlier reductions in our contributiondid not materially affect the number of people participating in the Scheme; indeed it would be surprising if they did since the cost of passages to the emigrant wasnot affected. An increase would, therefore, be unlikely to stimulate emigrationto Australia and so aggravate our manpower problems. Nor would it, as the oversea Migration Board suggest, increase the total resources available for assistedpassages it would merely transfer some of the cost from Australia to Britain.We recognise that there is no case for any British contribution to the Scheme onthe grounds of Australian financial need. Moreover, the British economy is now so seriously overstrained that the Government have been compelled to undertakefar-reaching measures to reduce the growth of public expenditure over the next five years; in particular, owing to our adverse external position, the Governmenthave been obliged to apply stringent criteria to expenditure in aid of our external
SECTION IIICHILD MIGRATION52. A number of charitable organisations in this country have for long devotedtheir funds to child migration, i.e., the emigration of children up to 16 years of age who go overseas alone, not in company with,&apos;or to join, grown-up members ofthe family. The charitable organisation selects the child, makes arrangements forgetting him to the new country and looks after him on his arrival there, usuallyin an institution owned by the organisation.   The only charitable organisationspolicies in order to maintain it at current levels. This means inevitably that manynew proposals, however strong the political or economic justification for them,cannot be accepted.47. On the other hand, we think that the political effects of dropping orreducing our contribution altogether would be very damaging to our relations with australia; and we think that an increase in the British contribution would help tomaintain and improve these relations out of all proportion to the amount of suchincrease. We cannot go so far as to recommend that the British contribution should be increased fivefold to  750,000 a year which the Australian Governmentseek. There are, however, in our view strong political reasons for a substantial increase in our annual contribution. It is indeed important that any increase inour contribution should be regarded, and should be presented, as a political gestureof goodwill and not as an indication that we expect or wish to stimulate the emigration of workers needed in this country.48. In the light of the hopes of the Australian Government for a marked increase in our contribution and the political need to strengthen Anglo-Australianrelations, we have considered whether an appropriate level for our contribution toa renewed Assisted Passage Scheme might be of the order of  500,000 per annum.But there are other considerations, particularly our present financial situation,especially in relation to our balance of payments. The Chancellor said inParliament on 25th July that he must take steps to contain the growth in expenditure in support of our external policies and to ensure that this expendituredoes not rise much above its present level of  180 million. An official report to ministers shows that existing commitments are already likely to exceed this totalby over 10 per cent, in 1962-63 and reach it in 1963-64. In these circumstances we recognise that an increase to  500,000 per annum would probably prove unacceptable to Ministers. .49. As an alternative to an immediate and sizeable increase we have consideredthe possibility of recommending that a separate financial agreement should be negotiated annually over each of the next five years, account being taken at the start of each year of the prevailing British financial situation. We conclude,however, that this would be not only a clumsy and somewhat undignified procedure,but also one which would probably not achieve the aim we have underlined of strengthening Anglo-Australian relations.50. While recognising the difficulty of securing authority for fresh expenditure at the present time, we think that a strong political case exists for some increase inthe British contribution to the Assisted Passage Scheme. This at present runs atthe annual rate of  150,000 as against a contribution of  750,000 which theAustralian authorities would now like us to make. In the light of our knownfinancial circumstances, we consider that the political ends would be achieved if wedoubled our contribution to  300,000 per annum.51. We recommend that it should be explained to the Australians that weare ready to negotiate a fresh five-year Agreement. As to the level of the british contribution, the majority of the Committee consider that this should be set at 300,000 per annum. The Treasury representative, however, feels bound to reservehis position on this recommendation on the grounds that, in present financial circumstances, there is a case for reducing the existing contribution; and that inthe light of this, the political aims ought to be capable of achievement by, at most,maintaining the contribution at its present level.
with which we are concerned in this report we refer to them hereafter as &quot; the societies&quot; are the following eight with which the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations has entered into agreements under the commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts:(a) The Fairbridge Society(b) Northcote Children&apos;s Emigration Fund for Australia(c) The Federal Catholic Immigration Committee of Australia(d) The Church of England Council for Commonwealth Settlement(e) Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes National Incorporated Association(/) The Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service(g) The National Children&apos;s Home and Orphanage(h) The Salvation army the societies now send only to Australia where they maintain 28 farm schools orother institutions approved by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationswho pays a subsidy in respect of each child.53. This subsidy is now at the rate of 10s. a week towards the child&apos;smaintenance until he attains the age of 16 years, so long as he is in the care of thesociety and an Australian State Government contributes. Each agreement except the one with the Salvation Army also provides for the payment of  4 towardsfitting out each child before he migrates. The society also receives in respect ofeach child: from the Australian Federal Government,  A. 10 towards his outfitand, until he attains the age of 16 years, 10s. a week and, from the AustralianState Government concerned, a weekly contribution (varying in amount from oneState to another) until he is 16.54. When child migration schemes were started 40 years ago, economicconditions in this country were bad and institutional care was the accepted, and often the only, kind available for children deprived of a normal home life.Emigration was then considered to offer the child in need of care better prospectsthan he could expect in Britain. Since the Second World War, however, economicconditions here have improved, a new child care service has been built up; many more children who would otherwise be in need of care are now legally adopted;temporary foster parents are found for a high proportion of children in the care of local authorities and voluntary organisations; and it is widely accepted thatinstitutional life should be the last resort for the child who cannot live with hisown parents. The result of these changes has been a marked reduction in thenumber of children available for emigration.55. In 1956 the Fact-finding Mission, sent to Australia by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations to collect information about the societies&apos;arrangements for the reception and upbringing of emigrant children, submitted areport (Cmd. 9832) that was critical of the societies&apos; work. On the recommendationof the Inter-departmental Committee of 1956, the societies were persuaded toundertake, as a condition of the renewal of the financial agreements, that certain general principles should govern their arrangements for the care of children andthat they would, on request, provide information to the Home Departments, andpermit their work to be inspected by the Home Departments. Since theninspectors of the Home Departments have kept in touch with the societies. (InScotland, responsibility for/the work has recently been transferred from theScottish Home Department to the Scottish Education Department.)56. Between 1948 and 1960 the societies arranged for 2^,365 children toemigrate to Australia at a cost to this country of  290,000 apart from the cost ofpassages. The statistics in Annex F show a marked decline since 1950. This trendhas increased since the Fact-finding Mission reported in 1956. The roman catholic organisations, previously responsible for about half the total number of child migrants to Australia, have turned away from emigration as a means ofproviding for children in their care; others are being more careful about the selection of children; and at lbast one society has begun to divert its resources to helping the emigration of whole families. During 1960 only 64 children emigratedand the total of British maintenance payments was under  13,500. At the endof that year less than 400 (about 20 per cent.) of the places available for Britishchildren in the societies&apos; institutions in Australia were occupied.
SECTION IVPOLICY TOWARDS VOLUNTARY EMIGRATION  ORGANISATIONS62. Grants-in-aid of administrative expenses are at present made to theSociety for the Oversea Settlement of British Women (S.O.S.B.W.), the Big BrotherMovement (B.B.M.), and the Church of England Council for CommonwealthSettlement (C.E.C.C.S.). These grants are made towards administrative expenditurein this country.  They do not qualify as schemes of assistance to settlers in the57. The societies have virtually outlived their usefulness and the Home office has considerable reservation about their standards of child care in such work asremains to them. Nevertheless, if (as we recommend elsewhere) the enabling statutewere renewed, it would be courting controversy to no purpose merely to decline to renew the agreements. Some at least of the societies would, if necessary, continue their work without the British subsidy. They are genuinely convinced that they still have a useful role; many people agree with them and they can count oninfluential support in Parliament; the Oversea Migration Board have justrecommended increased financial help; and the societies can quote tributes totheir work by successive Secretaries of State for Commonwealth Relations. nor could the change of policy be justified by any fall in the standard of the societies&apos;work (which has, if anything, improved) or any other change of circumstanceshere or in Australia since the statute was last renewed. It would be particularly unfortunate to rouse fruitless controversy when the amount of money involved is so small and the societies themselves are likely to die a natural death before longfor lack of child migrants.58. This may be some justification, however, for trying to persuade theAustralian Government, in return for an increased contribution to the assisted passage Scheme, to take over responsibility for the subsidy so far paid by Britain.The Australians want the migrants; they already pay the greater part of the subsidyfrom public funds; most of the money is spent in Australia; and the Australianauthorities supervise the societies&apos; establishments there. Transfer of this financial responsibility would, we think, be politically acceptable here. It would also havethe advantages that it would relieve the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations of the work of administering the agreements and negotiating periodicallywith the societies about them.59. On the other hand, it is the direct subsidy that provides the BritishGovernment with the sanction necessary for supervising the emigration work ofthe societies in this country. The Governments responsibility for the welfare ofthe children would remain, and some other sanctions would have to be found.We think that it might be possible, if the transfer were acceptable to the australian government, to persuade them also to undertake that they would pay their subsidy on broadly the same conditions as those incorporated in the present agreements with the societies. The societies would be required to continue to observe thegeneral principles agreed upon; to provide information to and allow inspectionby the Home Office or, as the case may be, the Scottish Education Department;and would be liable to have the subsidy discontinued by the Australian government if the Home Office or the Scottish Education Department reported some seriousdefect which the society was unwilling or unable to correct.60. We recommend that the possibility of making the changes described inthe two preceding paragraphs should be pursued with the Australian authorities. Ifthey prove unacceptable, we recommend a renewal of the existing agreements, forthree years in the first instance. As to the future level of the British contribution towards maintenance, we recognise that the existing rate of 10s. a week for each child was fixed as long ago as 1st January, 1949, and we think that changes in thevalue of money since then justify an increase to  1 a week in respect of both newmigrants and those already in Australia. We estimate that the additional costof such an increase might be approximately  23,000 over the next three years.61. If the enabling statute were not renewed, some means would have to befound for continuing contributions towards the maintenance of the child migrantsalready in Australia until the last had reached the age of 16 years.
sense envisaged in the Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts, andConsequently, payments appears as non-statutory items under the oversea settlement Vote of the Commonwealth Relations Office. It follows that thecontinuance of the grants is not bound up with a decision on the renewal of theActs.Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women63. The Society was formed in 1919 as a result of the Governments decisionto increase female emigration. It was promised financial support for so long as its activities conformed with official policy. Its main functions to-day are to give information and impartial advice on employment prospects and conditions in commonwealth countries, to interview, select and engage women for posts overseas(mainly in the teaching and nursing professions) and to provide an aftercare service.Apart from a small salaried headquarters staff, this work is performed by voluntaryworkers at home and overseas. The Society is entirely dependent upon voluntarysubscriptions to cover its operating costs.64. Statistics of the Society&apos;s income and movements arranged from 1945to 1960 are at Annex G. British grants during this period have amounted to some 102,000 or 80 per cent, of the total income (the figure for 1960 was 70 per cent.).Movements have declined in recent years from 820 in 1957 to 535 in 1960. Thistrend has continued in 1961. The great majority are to Canada, Australia, NewZealand and Southern Rhodesia and the balance to dependent British territories in Africa and the West Indies, and to South Africa. In 1960, over 80 per cent, ofthe women who emigrated with the Society&apos;s help were teachers, nurses or office workers.65. The Interdepartmental Committee of 1956 concluded that the Societyprovided a valuable service not offered by any other organisation and recommendedthat the existing grant of  8,000 per annum should continue until the end of 1959when it should be reviewed. Following representations from the Society in theautumn of 1959, the grant was increased to  10,000 per annum for the three years ending 31st December, 1962. A further request in 1961 for an enhanced grant tomeet higher rent charges was turned down. The Society has been urged to exploreways of reducing its dependence on the Government grant; for instance bycharging fees for selecting women for overseas posts, registering as a charity (with,consequent income tax relief on investments) or curtailing its recruitment. TheSociety has not yet adopted any of these proposals. It has, however, achieved a modest annual increase in its income from private sources.66 We consider that the Society still provides a competent service for womenemigrants and it can offer special facilities in this field because it draws heavily on voluntary efforts of a high calibre. By careful selection (including thediscouragement of those judged unsuited to life abroad) and aftercare, the Societydoes everything possible to ensure successful settlement. Moreover, the womenit assists, particularly the teachers, are in a position to exert some influence in thecountries to which they go and to strengthen the bonds with Britain. On theother hand, most of the employees recruited have qualifications and skills whichare in short supply in this country. Britain&apos;s manpower problems are thereforeincreased by the activities of the Society. But permanent emigration is only likelyto occur where the posts are in the traditional countries of settlement. those engaged for service in developing countries probably return to Britain when their contracts expire.67. On balance, we feel that, in the short term at least, the Society still hasa complementary role to play in the selection and oversea settlement of the categories of people with which it deals and that there is justification for continuing the existing grant until the end of 1962 as promised.Recommendation68. We recommend, however, that not later than July 1962 the question of future assistance should be reviewed, with particular reference to any furtherdecline in the number of movements overseas arranged by the Society and to theextent to which it performs services which could not conveniently be provided bygovernmental agencies. As to the latter aspect, the Department of technical co-operation should be consulted.
Big Brother Movement69. The Movement, which is non-political and non-sectarian, was founded in1924 to select and sponsor youths of 15 to 19 years for settlement in Australiaand to act as their guardian until the boys become of age. Travel to Australiais under the Assisted Passage Scheme. Each youth known as a &quot; Little Brother &quot;is then put under the supervision of a &quot; Big Brother &quot; to whom he can turnfor help and advice. Those who intend to take up farming receive training ata farm school before being placed with a selected employer; those who preferurban life are initially accommodated in a hostel near Sydney and subsequentlygo to private homes.70. Grants-in-aid of administrative expenses of the London Office were made from British funds from 1925 to 1931 and again from 1937 to 1940. Details of post-war grants and the annual movements are at Annex H. During this periodnearly 3,000 youths have emigrated and British grants have totalled some  4,000.Since 1955, the British Government have contributed on the basis of  2 10s. foreach youth subject to an upper limit of  1,000 per annum. The australian government contributed at the same level until the 1st July, 1959, when, in response to an appeal from the Movement for increased assistance, they doubled the grant;and they now pay to the Australian organisation an equipment and settlementgrant of  20 for each youth. The British Government declined to step up their contribution on the grounds that the Movement could earn a larger grant byrecruiting the maximum of 400 youths provided for under existing arrangements.71. The Movement has recently renewed its request to the British Governmentfor an enhanced grant, because of higher operating costs and a substantial increasein its volume of business. Sailings have been temporarily deferred because of theemployment situation in Australia but it is expected that these restrictions will be lifted in the New Year and that the number of youths recruited will steadily increase as a result of the facilities recently placed at the disposal of the Movement by theFairbridge Society.72. The British High Commissioner at Canberra confirms that the Movementenjoys a high reputation in all sections of the Australian community and that theyouths themselves provide some of the best material for successful settlement. Thisis due mainly to the care taken in recruitment and the facilities provided fortraining and aftercare in Australia.73. Although the emigration of these youths deprives this country of additions to the labour force, we do not consider that this has any measurable effect on ourmanpower problems; the numbers involved are small and skills have yet to be acquired, Australia, on the other hand, is keen to obtain British immigrants ofthis age who are easily assimilated.74. We consider that the Movement provides an efficient organisation for the selection and settling of young migrants in Australia and is deserving of support.We also recognise that costs have increased substantially since the existing Britishrate of contribution was fixed in 1955 and that it would be appropriate to double the grant.75. We have considered whether, in return fo ra larger contribution to the assisted Passage Scheme, the Australian Government might be invited to take over responsibility for the British Governmenfs contribution to the Movement; a recommendation on these lines has been made in the case of child migrationsocieties (paragraphs 58-60). But there are arguments in favour of treating theMovement differently from the societies. Its work is expanding and is likelyto continue for many years; the societies are moribund. The British contribution is spent entirely in this country; the subsidy to the societies is spent in Australia.The Movement is highly thought of in Australia, and there is political advantage in our being seen to support it; the same impact would not be made on Australianopinion if our subsidy were concealed in an increased contribution to the assisted passage Scheme.Recommendation76. On balance therefore we recommend that the British Government shouldcontinue to support the Movement. As to .the level of the contribution, werecommend that the existing grant, fixed in 1955, of  2 10s. for each youth andthe limit of expenditure of  1,000 per annum, should be increased to  5 per headand  2,000 per annum respectively.
Church of England Council for Commonwealth Settlement77. The Council was set up in 1925 by the Church Assembly to advise and assist emigrants to Commonwealth countries. It is mainly concerned with adultsettlement overseas but also operates a small scheme of child migration toAustralia (see Section III).78. In the adult field the CounciFs principal functions are to provide emigrantswith advice on problems which are not the concern of Government or commercialagencies, to arrange, through its overseas contacts, for their nomination andreception and to ensure that spiritual links are established on the voyage and afterarrival.79. Grants-in-aid of administrative expenses were made from time to time between 1925 and 1940. Since the war, the Council has on several occasions applied for further grants but until 1960 these were refused on the grounds (notcommunicated to the Council) that its activities did not directly further theGovernment^ emigration policy; were primarily pastoral in nature; and overlappedreception arrangements made by the receiving countries.80. In 1960 the Archbishop of Canterbury made a further appeal for funds to the Secretary of State and it was decided to make an ad hoc grant during 1961-62of up to  1,000 on the basis that the Government would contribute  1 for everypound in excess of  5,000 found by the Council from other sources. One of thereasons for making this grant was that it would enable the Council to improveits headquarters administrative arrangements in connexion with child migration.81. We consider that the reasons adduced for refusing the applications priorto 1960 still apply to-day. Moreover, it would be invidious to single out the council for special treatment. Other denominations also engage in adult migration but are entirely self-supporting. The CounciFs activities support rather than promoteemigration, with the exception of child migration which forms only a small part ofthe work. We have proposed in Section III that subventions to assist child migrationmight in certain circumstances become the responsibility of the australian government. The balance of the CounciFs work centres on settlementarrangements for adult migrants in receiving countries and we consider that it is for those countries to assess its value and to make financial provision accordingly.82. We do not consider that the British Government would be justified inmaking further grants-in-aid to the Council for adult emigration and we recommendaccordingly.SECTION VHOUSING SCHEMES FOR BRITISH EMIGRANTS83. The Government have frequently been urged to provide official funds,or to empower lending institutions such as building societies to make loans, toenable British emigrants, principally to Australia, to buy houses on easy terms. Ithas been said that the absence of such facilities, coupled with the shortage of rentalaccommodation in those countries, not only deters some people from emigrating butresults in others, who have tried to settle overseas, returning to this country.84. The Australian Government in particular have asked Britain to help itsemigrants to obtain homes and have cited as precedents the arrangements madeby the Netherlands and Italian Governments to assist their nationals.85. It has been suggested that British help could be given in the following ways:A. The Government could provide finance under the Commonwealth and empire Settlement Acts;B. British building societies could lend money, secured on property, eitherdirect to emigrants or through Australian building societies;C. British insurance companies and other lending institutions could establish a fund for emigrant housing.
Proposal B89. British building societies have evolved on a mutual basis takinginvestments from small investors, which they have an obligation to repay at short notice, and making advances on property, mainly owner-occupied houses. public confidence in building societies depends on Government supervision of their activities and loans being secured in real property which can be re-possessed ifborrowers should default on mortgage payments.A common feature of these proposals has been that the finance provided fromBritish sources should be matched   for   by Australian lending institutions andthe housing schemes operated through Australian building societies.86. In the following paragraphs we examine these proposals primarily inrelation to Australia.Proposal A87. Other considerations apart, this presents a legal problem. TheCommonwealth and Empire Settlement Acts do not specifically authoriseparticipation in housing schemes. Everything would therefore depend on theinterpretation placed on the definition of &quot; agreed schemes &quot;. Legal opinion onthis point has been inconclusive but it seems probable that it would be necessary toamend the Acts or to enact fresh legislation before the Government could enterinto a. housing scheme. For the reasons set out in sub-paragraphs 88 (c) and (d)such legislation would be controversial.88.   Other arguments for and against Government participation are:For(a) The Netherlands and Italian Governments operate housing schemes fortheir nationals in Australia and the Australian Government would likeBritain to provide similar facilities for its emigrants.(b) Emigration helps Britain to relieve its own housing shortage.Against(c) There would be political difficulty here in providing funds for house purchase in Australia while there is still a housing shortage in Britain.(d) In Britain, direct Exchequer assistance for housing is limited to loans forthe purchase of pre-1919 houses (this facility has been temporarilysuspended by the &quot;Little Budget&quot; of 1961) and to grants for improvements to houses. It would not be equitable to provide greaterfacilities for an emigrant who no longer pays British taxes than he could obtain whilst resident here and paying those taxes.(e) It is a well established principle that the receiving country should beresponsible for housing its immigrants. Considerable strides have infact been made by the Australian authorities in reducing the housingshortage in Australia in post-war years. There are indications (seeparagraph 94) that finance is not the determining factor in deciding the rate of house construction.(/) British emigration to Australia is considerable even though emigrants know that it will be difficult to secure a permanent home and that they willnot be helped financially by Britain.(g) For the reasons given in (c) and (d) above, legislation to bring housingschemes within the terms of the Commonwealth and Empire SettlementActs would be controversial. Moreover, the money that could be madeavailable under the Acts, even with counterpart Australian funds, would only provide a small number of houses. The question of selection would inevitably arise and would involve the Government in furthercontroversy.(h) If the British Government provided housing finance for its emigrants toAustralia, a precedent would have been set for emigrants to other commonwealth countries.(i) Any further investment overseas would aggravate Britain&apos;s balance ofpayments position. There are more urgent needs in developing countries for what Britain can afford to spend overseas. .
Proposal C92. British insurance companies and banks, have assisted financially informing building societies in Commonwealth countries, sometimes in partnership with British building societies which have provided executives to manage the affairs of the new venture. The idea would therefore not be new to British lendinginstitutions although whether or not they participated in any particular scheme would be a matter for their commercial judgment.93. The advantages of such an arrangement, would be that it would achieve the object desired by the Australian Government and others that Britain, like otherGovernments, should help its emigrants to buy homes; and by providing private housing finance from private institutions, it would avoid political pressure for theuse of Government funds for the purpose. The disadvantage would, however,be the capital out-flow from Britain which would aggravate a difficult balance ofpayments position.94. We have consulted the British High Commissioner at Canberra about thecurrent Australian housing position and the need for external finance for thepurpose, with particular reference to Proposal C. The main points in his report are:(a) The housing shortage is rather more than 100,000 units but the australian government have decided that, the appropriate rate of homeconstruction in present economic circumstances is about 80,000 unitsper annum. Governmental measures and financial assistance (whichis considerable) are therefore geared to a programme of this order.(b) Australian lending institutions are probably investing as much as theyprudently can in housing.(c) Finance is only one factor which determines the rate of construction.   the others are the availability of manpower and materials.id) It follows from (a) and (c) above that the provision of external finance forBritish emigrant housing would not necessarily increase the number ofhomes available. It would mean only that more people could competefor the available accommodation and that more of these people wouldBe British emigrants.ie) The existing Australian building society machinery is adequate for bothattracting private and institutional investments and financing homeownership.Recommendations95. (a) Proposal AIn view of the legal and political difficulties we do not recommend that any action should be taken to implement this proposal.o90. The Building Societies Acts, 1874 and 1960, preclude direct loans to individuals overseas for house purchase because this would involve societies in risksnot present in their normal business in this country. The Building Societies(Authorised Investments) Order, 1960, would however permit a building societyto invest part of its surplus funds in marketable securities guaranteed by a commonwealth Government. . In practice this would mean the issue by a commonwealth building society for a marketable fixed interest debenture, quotedon the London Stock Exchange, guaranteed by the Commonwealth government concerned and with a maturity of at most 25 years.91. Commonwealth Governments concerned have been informed of this legislation and it is now for them to consider whether they wish to take advantageof these facilities. It seems unlikely, however, that Australia will participate inarrangements of this kind. Moreover, most British building societies are currentlyconcerned to build up their more liquid assets and for the next few years will notbe able to invest in securities with more than five years to maturity; it is doubtfulwhether Commonwealth building societies would be interested in borrowing on themarket for such a short period.
Appendix 1MIGRATION STATISTICS1. The attached statistics of post-war British emigration to Canada, Australia,New Zealand and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland are taken from theCommonwealth sources.   They include all arrivals in the countries concerned.2. British emigration statistics are confined to departures by the long searoutes and are collected under the authority of the Merchant Shipping Acts. Inthe last decade, however, it has become apparent that an increasing number of emigrants travel by air; such evidence as is available suggests that the proportionmay now be as much as one-quarter of the traffic and that this method of travelis preferred by professional people leaving this country. No statistics exist of thisoutward flow by air.3. The Oversea Migration Board have repeatedly drawn attention to this gap in our knowledge and have urged a remedy, by legislation if need be (see Annex E).4. An official committee was appointed in 1957 to consider the question of migration statistics and devised a card scheme for the collection of migration andtourist statistics on the long air and sea routes. The scheme was introduced onthe sea routes on 1st November, 1960, but the shipping companies plainly indicated that their acceptance of the new arrangements was conditional upon parity with theair lines in this respect.5. The proposal to introduce legislation under the Statistics of Trade Act tocover the collection of statistics on the air routes was strongly resisted by the airlines. In addition, considerable opposition to the scheme was voiced both inParliament and in the Press. It was therefore decided not to introduce the fullcard scheme on the air routes but to experiment with sampling procedures.Sampling will not, however, yield reliable emigration statistics.6. The shipping companies are now pressing for parity with the air lines. Ifthe card scheme is withdrawn on the long sea routes and sampling is substituted,no firm statistics of emigration by sea or air will be available from official british sources.(b) Proposal BStatutory control of building societies&apos; investments is clearly essential andwe do not therefore recommend any amendment to existing legislation, which already provides outlets for overseas investment under suitable safeguards.Whether British building societies should invest their surplus funds (within thelimits permitted) in emigrant housing and whether, under(c) Proposal CBritish lending institutions should establish a fund for that purpose, isnot, we feel, within our terms of reference and we do not therefore make any recommendations. We would, however, stress that any further investmentoverseas at this time would create difficulties for Britain both in her balanceof payments problem and in meeting the prior claims of developing countries.

The Board&apos;s recommendations on emigration policy in 1956, 1958 and1960 were:&apos; That the United Kingdom should continue to encourage migration toother parts of the Commonwealth provided that there was no radical changein the composition of those migrating according to age, sex and occupation,or in the economic position of the country; and that this encouragement should include financial assistance to the extent that provision can be made in presentcircumstances.&apos;The Board believes this policy is still basically right but that the proviso about the economy of the country calls for comment at the present time. There is growingconcern that the continuing shortages of certain categories of skilled and professional manpower are hampering the development of our economy, even allowing for gains of such people by immigration. The Board wishes to draw attention to the combined effect of the three principal demands for this kind of manpower, viz.:(a) the requirements of our developing economy in a competitive world;(b) the  growing  needs  of  the  four  main  receiving  countries  of  theCommonwealth, viz.: Canada, Australia, New Zealand and theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland; and(c) the   ever-increasing   requirements   for   technical   assistance   of   the under-developed countries, especially the independent commonwealth countries and the dependent territories.The Board accordingly recommends:(a) that the Commonwealth and Empire Settlement Act should be renewed in1962;Annex D
24 CONFIDENTIAL -%(b) that the attention of Government bodies concerned with the futureplanning of higher education at university, technological and technicallevels, and of those concerned with industrial training andapprenticeship, should be drawn to the needs of the four main receivingcountries of the Commonwealth as a whole for skilled and professionalmanpower, with a view to increasing the ability of the United kingdom to provide for such needs overseas as well as for her own;(c) that  the   attention  of  the  four  main  receiving  countries  of  theCommonwealth should be drawn to the strained manpower resourcesof the United Kingdom in certain skilled and professional categories;and(d) that these countries should be. urged to consider whether they could findmore of their skilled and professional manpower requirements fromtheir own resources by increasing their own training facilities.2. The Board recommends the renewal of the Australian Assisted PassageAgreement in 1962 and urges that consideration should be given to an increase inthe United Kingdom token grant of  150,000 per annum, with a view to increasingthe total resources available for assisted passages.3. The Board recommends that the support of voluntary societies foremigration should be increased and that the outfit grants and maintenanceallowances for child migrants should also be increased in the light of current costs.4. The Board recommends that the possibility of providing either government or private finance from the United Kingdom for assisting house purchase by united Kingdom emigrants should be further explored.5. The Board deplores the difficulty of making recommendations onemigration policy based on inadequate statistics, to which it has frequently drawn attention. In view of our strained resources in certain categories of manpower,the Board feels that it is more than ever necessary that the facts of emigration and immigration should be properly surveyed. The Board therefore most stronglyrecommends that the necessary legislation should be introduced as soon as possibleto enable air migrant statistics to be compiled.6. The Board invites the Secretary of State to redefine the Board&apos;s terms ofreference. The Board has expressed the view in. several of its reports thatemigration policy cannot be studied properly without having regard to the balanceof migration and the effects of immigration on our manpower resources. while recognising that immigration is a subject involving wide and complex issues ofpolicy quite outside its purview,; the Board suggests that consideration might begiven to the widening of its terms; of reference sufficiently to enable it to takeproper account of the demographic effects of migration.&quot;GdNFiDENTTAL
