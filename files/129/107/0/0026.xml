AN NEK A xHI .........CONFIDENTIALPOST office the PRACTICABILITY OFA POST OFFICE GIRO system in THE UNITED KINGDOM
PREFACEby the Postmaster general. The Committee on the Working of the Monetary System (the RadcliffeCommittee) recommended in paragraph 964 of their Report (Cmnd. 827) that&quot; in the absence of an early move on the part of existing institutions toprovide the services which will cater for the need we have in mind (viz.,a simple system for the transfer of payments) there would be a case for investigating the possibility of instituting a &apos; giro&apos; system to be operated by the Post Office &quot;.2. The following Report ha&quot;s been prepared within the Post Office toshow what such a system might involve. Since the main body of the report was written the clearing banks have set up a credit clearing and have introduced a major extension of their credit transfer system. An Addendumcompares the facilities offered by the banks&apos; present scheme with those of a post Office giro.3. The practical question to which the Report gives rise is whether therewould be sufficient public demand for the facilities offered by a Post Officegiro to justify the establishment of such a system in parallel with the facilities offered by the banks, or whether the banks by themselves would cateradequately for the need to which the Radcliffe Committee referred. It isunderstood that the Banks, in the light of their experience of the credittransfer scheme, stand ready to extend that scheme into a full banking giro.4. The Government has reached no conclusion on this question. TheReport is being published as a contribution to informed thinking by allconcerned.

Continental Giro Statistics3REifelT ON THE PRACTICABILITY OF A POST OFFICE GIROSYSTEM IN THE UNITED KINGDOMCONTENT SParagraphsSummary of Conclusions

SUMMARY   OF   conclusions the main conclusions of this Report are as follows:  (1) It would be technically possible to organise in the United Kingdom a post Office giro service using modern electronic methods, offering theusual range of giro facilities, and capable of handling as high a levelof traffic as can be reasonably foreseen. Four or five years would berequired to plan and install the system (paragraphs 39, 43).(2) The financial success of the system would largely depend on its ability to build up a balance yielding sufficient investment income to enable it, with revenue from fees, to pay its way (paragraphs 57-61).(3) Initially the business attracted to the giro might be drawn mainly from the banks and from the Post Office&apos;s existing remittance services.Business firms should be important users. Wage earners without bankaccounts might well appreciate cheap current account facilities offered in the familiar setting of the Post Office (paragraphs 20-32).(4) The possible scale of development would enable giro business to be handled at the following scale of fees (paragraph 55):Transfers (from one giro account      Free, apart from cheque duty,to another)Deposits:To depositors own account      Free.To another account ...      6d.Cash payments:Up to  20   .........       6d.Over  20     .........      lOd. i-Plus cheque duty.On demand, up to  20    ...      10d.,Postage to giro ......      Free.Stationery       .........      At cost to Post Office.These fees are related to estimates of cost at present price levels.(5) The number of staff required at the central giro office would be 2,500for one million accounts, and 4,400 for 5 million accounts(paragraph 39).(6) Giro business would mean an increase of up to 3 per cent in counterwork in Post Offices. The planning period should provide sufficient time to accommodate this increase (paragraphs 44, 45).(7) A giro would also mean some increased Saturday work at the counter,and for clerical staff in the giro office it would mean a two-shift day(paragraphs 39, 40, 45).(8) If it were desired to mitigate the strain on the organisation and thelong hours of work necessary if the giro centre is to offer facilities equal571760*
to the best on the Continent, consideration could be given to relatingsome of these; e.g., clearance of debits and credits could be eflB^dwithin 48 hours, instead of within 24 hours. Such a step would,however, reduce the giro&apos;s advantage of speedy service. Similarly, the fees earned by the giro might be increased by making a charge fordeposits into the holder&apos;s own account; but this might so deter depositsas to restrict membership, or at least reduce the interest earned by thegiro on invested balances (paragraphs 63-65).I.   GIROS  ABROADFacilities Provided1. The giro is the term commonly applied to the postal cheque systemsas run by the Post Office in most European countries and in Japan. A girois the equivalent of a current account banking system in which all the accountholders bank with the same bank.2. The three basic facilities provided by a giro are:Transfer from one account to another by a written instruction to thegiro office.Deposits into an account (by non-holders as well as holders) at postoffices. .Cash out payments (to third parties as well as account holders) at postoffices by means of cheques.These three facilities are referred to throughout this report as Transfers,Deposits and Payments.3. A credit or debit slip is sent to each account holder after every trans-action in his account, together with a statement listing the transactions and stating the new balance. No interest is paid on the balance. No overdrafts are permitted. Transfers are free of charge but fees are charged for cash paymentsinto and out of the system. Various other services can be grafted on to thesystem (such as standing order payments, travellers&apos; cheques, overseas trans-actions, etc.), but for the purpose of the present report attention has been confined to the three basic facilities mentioned above.Speed of service. In Continental giros the clearance time for a transaction is 24 hourswhere the system is centralised, and for local transactions in a decentralisedsystem. Transactions involving two giro centres take 48 hours.5. By a 24-hour clearing is meant the following. A deposit made at a post office is credited to the giro account the next day. Transfer ordersreceived at the giro centre by a certain hour (e.g., 5 a.m. in Holland, 10 a.m.in Germany) are debited and credited the same day. Cash payment ordersreceived by the same hour are debited that day and payment at a post office is available the following day.6. There are facilities for urgent transactions on payment of supplementaryfees.
OthjaJFeaturesTWfo most countries banks and giro accept one another&apos;s paper. the banks often use the giro themselves for inter-office remitting. It is commonfor Government revenues and expenditure to be largely channelled throughthe giro. Special giro accounts are set aside for the receipt of tax revenues,which pass through the system until a final transfer at the Central Bankclears from the giro into the Exchequers bank account.8. Statistics of four Continental giros are given in the Appendix. Thenumber of giro accounts per thousand of the population (the &quot; penetration &quot;)is 11-4 in Norway (giro commenced 1943), 29-8 in West Germany, 62 in theNetherlands and 102-3 in France. Few wage-earners anywhere are giroaccount-holders, despite the favourable circumstance that wages are paidfortnightly in some countries.II.   A   BRITISH   GIRO-GENERALCONSIDERATIONSEstimating Demands9. There are considerable difficulties in attempting to estimate, by analogywith the Continent, what the demand for giro facilities would be in theUnited Kingdom. For example:(a) The Continental giros differ widely between themselves in size and activity.(b) They all relate to countries without the remittance facilities a highly developed and popular banking service, and a postal order system which already occupy the field here.10. Furthermore the ability of a giro to compete with the existing systemsin this country will depend upon the charges it makes; but these, being basedon costs, must themselves depend upon the size of the demand which it creates.In what follows, this circle has been broken by arbitrarily assuming a system with a million account holders (i.e., a penetration of 20 per thousand). ThisReport puts forward estimates of the volume of transactions which such asystem might engender, of the costs of the procedure necessary to handle these transactions, and of the fees necessary to cover those costs.11. If the system proved in at the &quot;low penetration&quot; assumed inparagraph 10 it could be expected to do so at higher levels, provided theydid not bring with them disproportionately expensive methods of handling.As a check on this, a further assumption of a system with five million accountholders (a penetration of 100 per thousand) has been made. In absolutesize, a centralised system of five million accounts would dwarf any giro nowin existence (the French giro has 4J million accounts, but the system isdecentralised) and would present problems not yet experienced elsewhere.12. For purposes of exposition, it will be convenient to begin with thelast stage of the circular process described in paragraph 10, anticipating for57176C&apos; 2
the purpose the fees which will be proposed below (paragraph 55). Thej^feesare as follows:TransfersDepositsCash paymentsPostage to giroStationery13. The following advantages of a giro in the United Kingdom, and what demand could beexpected from different classes of potential users, on the basis of fees ofthis orderO).The Advantage of Cheapness14. There is no published scale of bank charges for English banks, but a charge per entry is understood to be commonly made, offset by interest onthe average daily credit balance. The Personal Cheque Scheme run by onebank charges 6d. per cheque, of which 2d. is stamp duty. This schemeprovides cheque book service only, with no access to overdraft, loan orother services of the bank, and with no interest allowed on the balance ofthe account.15. It is clear that the average charge for a giro transaction, except foraccount holders making extensive cash payments, would be less even than this scheme. In particular, a giro transfer would be cheaper than a payment by bank cheque. There would be no postage by the sender to the creditor,and no equivalent to a bank charge.16. Paying in or drawing cash would mean visiting a post office.A demand withdrawal facility would be provided, with a limit of say,  20per transaction. (This compares with  10 from the Post Office Savings Bank,but would be available at one Post Office only.) The same sanctions shouldbe available against anyone issuing a giro cheque against insufficient fundsas apply to a bank cheque.17. The giro would therefore offer essentially the same facilities as a bank current account (except that overdrafts would not be permitted) andin most cases at less cost.The Advantage of Celerity18. The giro would also have the advantage over the banks that it wouldprovide a statement of account after every transaction, instead of at monthlyor less frequent intervals.C1) In the assessment that follows, bank cheque facilities and Post Office remittanceservices are taken as the basis of comparison. The effect of the banks&apos; credit transfersystem is examined in the Addendum.Free, apart from cheque duty.By account holder to his own account Freeotherwise: 6d.Up to  20......    6d.TOver  20    ......   lOd. yPlus cheque duty.On demand up to  20   lOd. JFree.At cost.paragraphs  consider what would  be the special
19. Moreover, debits and credits would be cleared more quickly. ThecyijflB)f collection and payment of a general clearing cheque takes three days^at the minimum and the payee cannot draw against the funds untilthe fourth day. In the case of a cheque sent through the post, this makes atotal of five days or more, as contrasted with the three days of the giro. a bank cheque is first credited to the account of the payee, and only thereafterdebited to the drawer. Hence the credit has to remain a provisional oneuntil the debit has been effected. A giro, on the other hand, first debits thedrawer&apos;s account and then credits the payee&apos;s. The cost of clearing a chequeis understood to be around Is. The giro cost is much lower, because thereare no clearing and inter-bank conveyance and book-keeping operations tobe carried out.III.   ATTRACTIONS   FOR  POTENTIALBRITISH   USERSBusiness Firms, etc.20. For any firms or organisations receiving a large number ofremittances, whether by cheque, postal and money order, registered letter,or cash at the desk, the giro offers great benefits. They would be saved thework of handling and banking a mass of paper and currency and would bein credit earlier with giro transfers than with bank cheques because of thegreater speed of clearing. Organisations in this category might includebuilding societies, hire-purchase houses, insurance companies, localauthorities, nationalised boards, telephones, department stores and mail orderfirms. The extent to which such firms, etc., would use the giro for outpay-ments would probably depend largely on what proportion of their employees and pensioners elected to receive payment by giro transfer or cheque. Apossible special use would be by firms making large numbers of pensionpayments.Banks21. The experience of continental countries suggests that there wouldbe a demand by Bank customers for facilities for transfer to and from giroaccounts. This could be met, as it is on the Continent, by the Banks holdinggiro accounts themselves, through which their customers&apos; transactions couldbe channelled. (This would not be essential. Banks could account withgiro via the Bank of England as they now do with the Post Office, and eachother.)22. Similar arrangements could apply with the Post Office Savings bank and the Trustee Savings Banks, which could open giro accounts through which credits for their members could be transferred to or from savingsaccounts. It is difficult, however, to envisage any closer form of co-operationwith the Savings Banks. In fact, it might be found better to transfer to thegiro some of the current account facilities (including standing orders) now given by the Post Office Savings Bank.
Government Departments23. Again by analogy with continental experience Government SBurt-ments as paymasters of large numbers of staff, and as recipients of a rrrefss ofremittances, could be expected to find advantages in the use of a giro system.24. On the other hand, the giro would appear to offer no advantages overthe present system of payment of Governmental pensions and allowances inthe United Kingdom by books of payment orders. Relatively few beneficiarieswould have giro accounts to permit of payment by transfer instead of cashat the counter.Private Individuals with Bank Accounts25. For bank customers who find bank charges heavy the giro could bean attraction. Such persons might continue to run a bank account for theircash needs (and to retain access to other bank services) and use the girofor transfer business only. But it seems unlikely that the class of personalaccount attracted away from the banks would be remunerative to the giro,even though the cheaper operating costs of the giro would enable it to makea profit on a lower operating balance per customer.26. The size of the individuals balance is not, however, the onlyconsideration. If a giro is set up, people who do not themselves hold accountswill use it for deposits into and payments from other people&apos;s accounts. Thegiro is most efficient in handling transfers and accordingly a substantial volume of transfer business should be its aim. This requires a large numberof account holders. If some happen to hold small balances, their verypresence in the system increases the volume of money flowing through it,and the giro balances of the business firms with whom they have dealingswill probably be larger in consequence.Private Individuals without Bank Accounts27. It is, of course, an essential feature of the giro to offer remittancefacilities to non-account holders, and private individuals without bankingaccounts could be expected to use it mostly to settle bills at Post Officecounters.28. At a deposit fee of 6d. (paragraph 12) the giro would be able to compete on cost as well as on the score of convenience. For money orders and registered letters the minimum fee in each case is Is. plus postage. Thepresent scale of postal order poundage is as follows:Face value Poundage6d. and Is.......... 2d.&quot;)Is. 6d. to 21s....... 3d. VPlus 3d. postage. 2 to  5      ......... 6d.JThus except for sums under Is. 6d. a remittance through the giro would costno more, and for sums above 21s. would cost less, than posting a postalorder. If the giro fee were prepaid by the payee (as is commonly done on theContinent), the attraction would be greater still.
29. As regards convenience, the advantage to the remitter would be thatirrjjttkd of buying a postal or money order or registered envelope and himselfseiSHfg it to the payee, the Post Office would merely accept the cash and acompleted deposit form from him and this would be the end of the matter.30. It is not easy to see, however, any substantial net increase in business to the Post Office from this source. The people who would use the depositservice would mainly be those now using the normal postal remittance services,with possibly a few now handing in cash at bank counters.31. More important is the question whether the cheapness and accessi-bility of giro facilities might attract as account holders many people who now have no current account. The fact is that in the countries with girosystems, account holders form a smaller proportion of the population than doprivate bank account holders in the United Kingdom; and the giros have notrecruited their holders from outside, or even as far into, the range coveredby the banks here. The highest giro penetration is in France, where it is10 per cent, of the population. By contrast, some 12 to 16 per cent, of people in this country are estimated to have current accounts with the clearing banks, including an estimated 750,000 wage earners.32. From this it might be inferred that the banking habit in this country isalready so well entrenched that the giro would be unlikely to find any newfield of recruitment. An alternative inferencais that if the banking system can penetrate thus far the giro, conducted IkatTne familiar and ubiquitousmachinery of Post Offices could penetrate farther, particularly amongwage earners who have no bank account. The payment of wages by bank-transfer or by cheque could be an important factor in this. The rise in living standards would be another. In the United States, where payment ofwages by cheque is commonplace, more than 80 per cent, of all householdsuse the banks, against an estimated 30 per cent, in the United Kingdom^).Total Demand33. There is therefore a wide range of uncertainty about the level andrate of growth of the demand for the facilities a giro would offer. In the analysis that follows, the financial prospects of a giro are examined under conditions of both &quot; low penetration&quot; (a million members) and &quot; highpenetration&quot; (five million members). The first step is to estimate the volumeof transactions to which these penetrations might give rise.IV.   VOLUME   OF. TRANSACTIONSTransfers34. The analysis in Part IV suggests that at &quot; low penetration &quot; a girowould be well weighted with the accounts of business firms and public authorities. Continental experience makes an average of 125 transfers perO Cited by Sir Harold Bibby (Martins Bank), The Times, January 11, 1960.11
account each year 125 million transfers per annum) seem reasonable. Thebulk of the further four million holders making up the &quot; high penetr^fca &quot;estimate would be private individuals, perhaps averaging no more tl^r 50transfers each per year, but their presence would of course generate moretransfers from the original core of holders (e.g., as salary credits, etc.). Overallthere might be as many as 400 million transfers per year. This means anaverage of 80 per account against 49 in the French giro, but this might beregarded as reasonable when the well-developed cheque habit of people inthis country is borne in mind.Deposits35. Deposits may be expected mainly as replacements of the presentpostal and money order business between members of the public and firms(other than pools and other competitions). This is some 240 million perannum. Allowing also for the take-over of some registered letter traffic for people who now pay cash direct at their creditors&apos; premises, and for giroaccount holders paying into their own accounts, total deposits may be put at 260 million per annum. This figure would drop somewhat as more andmore people became account holders and so made transfers instead ofdeposits. Deposits under &quot; high penetration &quot; may be put at 200 million perannum.Payments36. Payments would consist of cash withdrawals by account holders and payments to third parties. If the fee were more than the poundage on apostal order, cash payments to third parties would more likely continue tobe made in that way. (In this connection the payment statistics for continentalgiros are probably too high to serve as much of a guide, as they have only an expensive money order and no postal order service to compete with.)In any event, the fact that a fee would be charged would make people keepall payments to a minimum. Annual transactions might look like this:5m. holders90m.10m.80m.10m.90m.1812lm. holdersCash withdrawals by holders, 50per cent, once monthly and 50per cent, twice monthly      ... 18m.Less firms etc., who would not make cash withdrawals      ... 9m.9m.Cash payments to third parties ... 6m.15m.Average per account    ... 15
Total Transactionsijffib Estimates of the total traffic which a United Kingdom giro mightattnrci under conditions of &quot; low &quot; and &quot; high &quot; penetration are thereforeas follows:Low penetration      High penetrationmillion per annum    million per annumTransfers        ...... 125 400Deposits......... 260 200Payments        ...... 15 90400 690Total  daily   transactions(5-day week)   ......        1,540,000 2,650,000Per annum Per annumTransactions per account Transfers        ......                125 80Deposits...      ...      ...                260 40Payments        ......                 15 18400 13838. There is a great deal of guess-work about these figures, but the effecton the financial outcome of substituting some different transaction figures fordeposits and withdrawals will be seen later to be largely self-adjusting, the variation in cost being largely balanced by that in income.V.   ORGANISATIONGiro Central Office39. It has been assumed that the giro clearing would be done at onecentre. This would have to be equipped with an electronic book-keepingsystem, because it would not be feasible to handle on a manual system in oneoffice the traffic level contemplated. A punched-card system is also out of thequestion for the same reason. A system has been designed which would fulfil the foregoing requirements. It would require a staff of 2,500 for &quot; lowpenetration &quot; and 4,400 for &quot; high penetration &quot;.40. So long as this single centre is worked on a 24-hour basis this assumption obviously provides the fastest overall clearing. Centralisationwould also enable the equipment costs to be kept at a lower level than witha regionalised system. But a certain level of traffic would be reached thelevel depending on the type of equipment being used when the difficultiesof giving a 24-hour service at the centre began to assume such proportionsthat a 48-hour clearing service would have to be considered. At this point the possibility would arise of being able to restore some measure of 24-hourservice on locally cleared transfers by adopting a regionalised system, at theprice of incurring an increase in cost over the centralised system. It is in fact
considered just possible to run a 24-hour clearing centralised system for the traffic levels postulated, although this results in a very tight timetaMBiifrndin two-shift working for clerical staff. &apos;^SP41. In order to provide the necessary length of working day at the GiroCentral Office, and at the same time enable its statements of account to be inthe hands of its customers on the following day, the Giro Central Office mustbe located near a focal point of the Travelling Post Office network in theMidlands. It would also have to be located at a point where sufficient clerical staff could be recruited. These requirements should not be conflicting.42. Even though, in designing the system, mechanisation has been pushedto the maximum possible extent, staff costs would still be the greatest singleitem in the annual running costs. This is because it has been assumed thatit would be necessary to employ a clerical staff to convert the information from the documents received by the Giro Central Office into a form whichcan be fed into the machines. Very substantial economies would be producedif this data conversion process could be avoided, but no practicable system by which this can be done is at present known.43. The period of time necessary to plan in detail, obtain accommodation and equipment, and get such a system working must be measured, even withpriorities, in years; and the total effort required is nearly five hundred manyears. At least four or five years&apos; preparation would therefore be essential.Counter Work44. As already stated (paragraph 30) the giro business handled at Post Officecounters would probably be very largely in substitution for existing types of counter work. Numerically the transactions would be fewer but the time required would be greater. This is the net effect of replacing postal order and registered letter transactions (which require less time than woulda giro transaction) and money order transactions (which require more).The increase in the time required at Crown Office counters is estimated at - 5 per cent, at &quot; low penetration &quot; and 3 - 0 per cent, at &quot; high penetration &quot;.If this increase in work could be spread evenly over the week, it ought to bepossible to cope with it without much difficulty at the majority of PostOffices. It appears likely, however, that the giro would tend to increase the pressure which most offices experience on Fridays and Saturday mornings,,and some offices at lunch-time on other days.45. On the other hand, there would be a period of years available, duringthe planning stage, for providing the necessary capacity, and it is a reasonableassumption that the slight increase of work which a giro would bring to PostOffice counters could be accommodated when the time came.Mail Work46. A sorting office to handle the giro mail would be established at theGiro Central Office. The cost of it would fall on the postal services, as thegiro itself would be required to pay full public tariff rates for mail. It isestimated that the rank and file staff required would not exceed about 120at &quot; low penetration &quot; and some five times as many at &quot; high penetration &quot;.The staff requirements would fall if some measure of pre-sorting or some kind of mechanical sorting proved practicable.
VI.   FINANCE^SW. At present price-levels, minimum estimates of the capital cost of aGiro Central Office and equipment at the &quot; low penetration&quot; level are 4 - 7 million, and of the annual charges, including staff costs, interest, depre-ciation, maintenance and materials,  3 million per annum. Both figures wouldbe increased by  0-5 million if the work schedule provided for an 8 a.m-9 p.m. instead of a 7 a.m.-10 p.m. day. For the &quot; high penetration &quot; system the costs would be about 75 per cent, greater.48. To these costs must be added the Post Office charges for transactingthe business at local offices and for carrying the correspondence. An appro-priate charge in respect of local Post Office costs would be 6d. per deposit oroutpayment, plus a further 4d. for withdrawals on demand and for additionalsecurity measures for large payments. Mail charges would be at tariff, girocorrespondence (which would be enveloped, because of the details of personalfinance contained) ranking as first class mail and hence charged at 3d. and upwards according to weight.49. The annual running costs of a giro at the traffic levels assumed in this report, and with a Post Office charge of 6d. per basic transaction for local office work, would therefore be as follows:Low penetration    High penetration 000  000Giro office   .........             3,000 5,250Local office charges deposits            6,500 5,000Local office charges-payments           375 2,250Mail charges.........             1,850 8,95011,725 21,45050. These figures produce a cost per transaction as follows:Low penetration High penetrationTransfer     ...... 4-48d. 5-89d.Deposit      ...... 7-95d. 8-35d.Payment     ...... ll-42d. 12-56d.These costs allow for the greater share of Giro Central Office work occasioned by a transfer (because it affects two accounts) and the variation in postagerequirements as between the three types of transaction. The increase in all three costs under &quot; high penetration &quot; is due to postage. The average cost per transaction works out at approximately 7d.51. These costs would have to be met by transaction fees, by the interest on account holders&apos; balances, and to a small extent by charges forstationery, etc.Fees52. The great social benefit conferred by a giro is the economic provisionof machinery for making payments without the use of cash. Transfers wouldhave the incidental benefit of reducing pressure at Post Office counters. by building up as big a volume of transfer business as it can handle, the girowould increase the balance at its disposal, and the resulting investmentincome. Transfer business would therefore be encouraged, by making transfersfree of charge, except for stationery and for cheque duty.
53. For deposits and withdrawals the basic charge made to the giro for post Office counter services would be 6d. It is thought that the giro dfrtldin turn charge 6d. to its customer. Deposits to the holder&apos;s own aSBSimtshould be free of charge, and fees for other deposits would be payable bythe giro account holder. If he were not willing to bear these permanently hewould be at liberty to add them to his account when sending the latter tothe debtor. This would avoid separate accounting for fees at the counter.54. The documents effecting transfers and payments would appear prima facie to be bills of exchange within the meaning of section 32 of the StampAct, 1891, and therefore to be liable to duty like a cheque.55. The fees envisaged are therefore as follows:Transfers     ...      Free, apart from cheque duty.Deposits      ...      By account holder to his own account Freeotherwise: 6d.Cash payments     Up to  20......     6d.&quot;)Over  20    ......   lOd. [-Plus cheque duty.On demand up to  20   lOd. JPostage to giro     Free.Stationery    ...      At cost.A weighted average of these fees would amount to a little over 4d. at first,diminishing to a little under 3d. at &quot; high penetration&quot;. But this figure is no more than a statistical abstraction. For the account holder using mostlytransfers, the average cost would be substantially less; for a non-membermaking deposits, or a business firm receiving many deposits or makingoutpayments, the average cost would be somewhat greater.56. At the transaction levels suggested, these fees would produce thefollowing income, with the costs already quoted shown for comparison. Forsimplicity, the extra costs and fees for high value payments and demandwithdrawals have been omitted from both sides, being largely self-balancing.Cheque duty is also excluded.Low penetration    High penetrationDeposit fees.........Payment fees ......Stationery    .........Income from fees, etc. ...Annual cost (paragraph 49)Gap to be met by investmentincome     ......... m.	 m.6-35	4-25-38	2-25-15	-76-88	7-2011-73	21-454-85	14-25Investment57. In the United Kingdom the joint-stock banks hold some 8 per cent, oftheir deposits in cash, 22 per cent, in short-term paper, and 70 per cent, inadvances and investments. It does not seem unreasonable that a giro shouldbe able to manage with similar liquidity ratios. The average yield on British
1Treasury Bills over the decade of the 1950s was 2-88 per cent., and on long-teiflpritish Government stocks 4-3 per cent. A weighted average of theseyielos, in the proportions of 22 per cent. Treasury Bills and 70 per cent, stocks(with 8 per cent, cash) is 3-65 per cent. An average rate of interest of 3 percent, or 3J per cent, might therefore be a reasonable basis for calculating thegiro&apos;s prospective investment income.58. On this basis, the balance required to produce an investment incomesufficient to bridge the gap between fees revenue and total costs, and theaverage balance per account which this would represent, would be asfollows:Low penetration High penetrationAverage rate Average rateof interest of interest3 per cent. 3\per cent. 3 per cent. 3 J per cent. 160m.      140m.  475m.      410m.Total balanceAverage balance peraccount...... 160 140 95 8259. The average balance per account would, of course, be made up of a lot of modest balances in personal accounts (especially in the high penetrationsystem) and a much smaller number of substantial balances in business andpublic accounts.60. The mechanics of the giro would necessarily ensure that considerablebalances were always being held. But a balance in a private individual^ bankaccount is profitable to its holder, if only to the extent that its size is takeninto account in computing bank charges; whereas a balance in a giro wouldhave no such effect. Holders both of bank and of giro accounts might therefore be expected to seek to keep the balance on the latter as small aspossible by continual transfers to the former. This effect is not muchexperienced on the Continent, because bank accounts are not so widely held as in the United Kingdom.61. The average balance per account in several Continental giros is,however, appreciably higher than the minimum required to produce thenecessary level of investment income for the &quot; low penetration &quot; system. as for the &quot; high penetration &quot; system, the required averages of  95 or  82 peraccount are far below the average balance achieved in France (with the samepenetration).VII.   SUPPLEMENTARY   CONSIDERATIONS62.&apos; This Report has been concerned with the application to Britishconditions of a giro on the Continental pattern. There are however severalrespects in which a departure from this pattern might be thought advisable.Before a decision to provide a giro in this country was taken it would benecessary to decide what line should be taken on each of these.63. It has been assumed that a British giro would be organised to clearall transactions within 24 hours, as is the usual practice abroad where thereis a single giro centre. However, a 48-hour clearing would save perhaps 7 per
cent, of the running costs of the giro centre, compared with a 2^giurclearing, and would increase the balance for investment. In additiofjpthelonger period would markedly reduce the strain on the organisation and theneed for clerical staff to work as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 10 p.m.64. A similar question arises in regard to the degree of centralisation ofthe giro. A single centre is desirable and practicable, at any rate up to the&quot; high penetration &quot; level envisaged. But the organisation would be perhapseasier to staff if there were two separate centres, one in the north and one inthe south. An extra day would be required for clearing transactions which involved both of them.65. It has been assumed that deposits by a giro account holder into hisown account would be allowed free (paragraph 53). It should, however,be recognised that there would be disadvantages. For example, giro accountsmight be opened purely for purposes of instalment buying. Instalments could then be paid by the client depositing them in his own giro account, free of charge, and immediately transferring them, also free of charge, to the giroaccount of the company. The giro would then have two transactions to handle,with no fee, and no more interest to be earned than if the deposit had beenmade direct to the company&apos;s giro account. On the other hand it is possiblethat clients who originally opened giro accounts for that purpose mightgradually extend their use and accumulate balances in them. And to charge for deposits might reduce the average balances held by the giro and so theinterest it could earn.
Banks&apos; Credit Transfer system. Credit Transfers consist of:1. Payments made on instructions given by a customer to his bank toplace funds to the credit of other customers either of the same bankor of other banks.2. Credits consisting of cash, cheques, etc., paid in over the counter by acustomer or his agent for his account either at another branch of thesame bank or at another bank. (Customers&apos; credits.)3. Credits paid in over the counter by persons other than the customer or his agent whether at the account holding branch or at another branchor bank. Such credits are commonly received in settlement of hire purchase and building society payments, insurance premiums, gasand electricity accounts and the like, mainly from people who do not maintain banking accounts. (Third party credits.)3. The credit transfer facility is available to everyone, whether a customerof a bank or not. A non-customer must call at the bank and make hispayment across the counter. The fee for this is 6d. per credit. The bankcustomer can either send his instructions by post or give them at the counter.There is no fixed charge to bank customers for credit transfers, the amount,if any, varying according to the work involved in providing these and otherbank services and to the value of the account maintained.4. The credit transfer system uses a standard form, showing the name and branch of the bank to which payment is to be made, the name of the account to be credited, the name of the remitter and the amount. A bankcustomer can pay several accounts by a single cheque, making out a credittransfer form for each account and listing the individual sums on anaccompanying schedule.5. Normally the recipient^ account is credited on the second businessday after receipt by the bank of the instructions, except when a week-endintervenes, when an extra day is required. The original credit slips are sentto him as and when he requires them.6. For those customers who receive a large number of credits regularly,an additional service can be provided whereby they receive, a day earlier than under the normal procedure, a machine list of the credits receivedtogether with the supporting transfer slips. This however does not affect thenormal date of crediting of such items.ADDENDUM, JUNE 19611. The foregoing Report has taken as a basis of comparison bank chequefacilities and the existing Post Office services for the remittance of money.Since the Report was prepared the banks have set up a credit clearing andhave introduced a major extension of their credit transfer system.
Comparison with a Post Office Giro ^ -\7. The banks&apos; credit transfer system has many similarities with tllPgirosystem described in the Report. Under either scheme:(c) a member of the public without an account (giro or bank) can, for afee of 6d., settle a debt in cash over the counter instead of sending aremittance by post;(b) an account holder can make a payment, or a number of payments atthe same time, by a single instruction to the office (giro or bank)maintaining his account, instead of sending a cheque to each payee.8. There are also points of difference as follows:General Availability. A Post Office giro would be more widelyavailable. There are 25,000 Post Offices as compared with about 12,500banks. Also, unlike Post Offices, banks are open only between 10 a.mand 3 p.m. and are closed on Saturday afternoons.Speed. A credit paid in at a Post Office would be credited to therecipienfs giro account on the following day, whereas under the banks&apos;system the transaction is credited one day later. An instruction posted to the Giro Central Office would be executed on the day of receipt;under the banks&apos; system the recipienfs account is normally creditedon the second business day after receipt of instructions. These timings forthe Post Office system would be up to one day later if the giro wereorganised on a 48-hour clearing basis (see paragraphs 40 and 63).Advice of Payment. Under the giro system a statement of accounttogether with the credit slips would be issued free of charge to an accountholder after every day in which a transaction was passed through hisaccount. The frequency of issue of statements and credit slips by the banks is at the customers option. The early advice of credits under the banks&apos; additional service for larger customers (paragraph 6) would be a normal facility for all customers of the Post Office giro.Charges. Transfer from one account to another would be free inthe giro system (apart from cheque duty and a small charge for stationery)irrespective of the size of the account. There may or may not be a charge for bank credit transfers depending on the nature of the account and other factors. Postage is paid on a customer^ correspondence with his bank;correspondence between an account holder and the Giro Central office would be post free.A cash withdrawal up to  20 by a Post Office giro account holderwould be charged a fee of 6d. plus a further 4d. for larger amounts orfor a withdrawal up to  20 on demand at a nominated office. In the case ofa bank customer, the whole of his balance may be withdrawn on demand at the branch bank where the account is kept, or elsewhere by arrange-ment; the charge made, if any, depends on the range of services used byhim.

Notes n.a. Not available.(a) This figure probably includes accounts classified as miscellaneous by other countries.(6) The giro in Norway dates only from 1943. It is heavily weighted with government business.(c) In France no interest is allowed on that part of the giro&apos;s balance pertaining toGovernment accounts (about 30 per cent, of the whole). A notional 1-5 per cent,only is credited by the Treasury on the remainder.(d) Counting a transfer as one transaction.(e) Because of the small number of account holders, the Norwegian giro is mainly adebt-collecting agency over Post Office counters, and this is reflected in the depositstatistics.(/) In Norway and France many social security payments are made through the giro.This explains the higher percentage of giro payments in the two countries.(g) Total transfers (counted as 1 each) -r- number of accounts.57176   P.O.P.
ANNEX BTHE COMMITTEE OF  LONDON CLEARING BANKERSTelephone :MANsion House 334110 Lombard Street,London, E.C. 3.29 th June, 1961.Dear Postmaster-General,My colleagues and I are grateful to you for giving us the opportunity of reading the revised Report on the Practicability of a Post Office Giro System and we thankyou for your courtesy in this matter.We give in the appendix attached our further comments on the proposedReport.We must, however, emphasise the fundamental issues involved; although wehave made some of these points before, we consider them to be of sufficient importance to be repeated.This country already has a cheque system which, augmented by the stilldeveloping Credit Transfer scheme, provides a fully comprehensive paymentssystem without equal, certainly in Europe and probably in the world. We regard it as being superior to any of the Continental systems, including Giro, which filleda gap that does not exist in this country. It is worthy of note that in the UnitedStates no system of credit transmission operates or appears to be contemplated.As you will know, the banks have proceeded with their Credit Transfer schemestep by step. It has always been regarded by them as a base from which expansionwould take place in any direction which experience, assisted by our encouragement of publicity, showed was required. The ultimate establishment of a centralaccounting organisation, or even a Bank Giro, has always been part of our thinkingand we therefore keep a continuous watch on the position. What has been done so far has taken us a considerable way but we hold strongly to the view that before proceeding further, time should be allowed to assess the nature and extent ofpublic demand.Having regard to what the banks have done and are prepared to do, we believe it would not be in the country&apos;s best interests for the Government to set up a rivalsystem in the form of a Post Office Giro, at considerable cost to the community.Moreover, we question whether any avoidable duplication of clerical labour canbe justified in view of the present overall shortage of manpower.If such an organisation were set up, the effect must be to withdraw depositsfrom the banking system, a matter which the banks would view with grave concern.Their ability to do their legitimate and necessary business of financing industryand commerce would inevitably be impaired. The pressures on them in thisrespect, particularly for exports, are constantly increasing and to deprive them ofpart of their capacity to respond to the normal demands of customers could not fail to be seriously detrimental to the economy as a whole.The banks would not be willing to see their deposits eroded without taking action and, should a Post Office Giro be proceeded with, they believe there wouldbe no alternative but for them to set up their own Giro even though they themselvesfelt that there was no public demand for so doing.We have stated our general views and we now turn to the booklet itself. It isin comparing the two systems that we feel the booklet, is unrealistic. To take atheoretical system and to set it against a service already available to the public ata reasonable cost and still in process of development is misleading and our comments on a few details, which we have appended, must be set-against that background.We have thought it right to put our views clearly before you since we feel strongly that, as adequate and adaptable payment systems already exist, the setting up of a Post Office Giro would be against the general interest.
4 CONFIDENTIAL gAIn view of the importance of this whole subject to the future of the clearing banks, we are sending a copy of this letter to the Governor of the Bank of Englandand asking him to pass it on to the Treasury. The Report, if published, is boundto give rise to discussion and we should wish to make our views known at theappropriate time.Yours sincerely,OLIVER FRANKS.The Right Hon. J. R. Bevins, M.P.,Her majesty&apos;s Postmaster -General,General Post Office,St. Martin&apos;s-le-Grand,London, E.C. 1.AppendixClearing  Banks&apos;   Comments  in   Regard   to   the   Revised   Report   on   the praticability of a Post Office Giro System in the United kingdom. Preface(a) In the last sentence of paragraph 2 we should like the word &quot; present &quot;after the word &quot; banks &quot;.(b) We consider that a further sentence should be added to paragraph 3to the effect that it is understood that the banks, in the light of their experienceof the Credit Transfer scheme, stand ready to extend that scheme into a fullbanking Giro, preliminary plans for which have already been studied.2. AddendumParagraph 8(a) General Availability(i) With reference to the statement &quot; as compared with about 9,000banks &quot; there are in fact 10,668 clearing bank offices in England and wales and a further 1,730 Scottish offices.(ii) Branch banks are very well spread and to say that &quot; manycommunities&quot; are without regular banking facilities is simply not factual.(b) SpeedWe suggest that there is some conflict here with paragraphs 40 and 63of the Report, which indicate that a successful Post Office Giro handling alarge volume of work might be compelled to adopt a 48-hour service. Infact, there are so many reservations as almost to nullify the claim for a24-hour service; in particular, in paragraph 63 it is stated that a 48-hourclearing would save perhaps 7 per cent, of the running costs of the giro centre and that the longer period would markedly reduce the strain on theorganisation.(c) Advice of PaymentWe consider that the words &quot; but is no doubt a factor in the charges onhis account&quot; should be omitted since the cost of issuing statements and creditslips is not a material factor in assessing charges.id) Charges (2nd paragraph)The last sentence does not do justice to the wide range of services available from the banks.   We suggest that it should be replaced by &quot; In the case of a bank customer, the whole of his balance, as opposedto a limit of  20 in the Post Office scheme, may be withdrawn on demand at the branch bank where the account is kept, or elsewhere by arrangement; the charge made, if any, depends on the wide range of services available to and used by him.&quot;(e) Cash PaymentsThis paragraph ignores the facilities which the banks provide by theircheque system. Very many cheques are cashed for people without bankaccounts and if the paragraph is to appear at all reference should be madeto the fact that the credit transfer system and the cheque system run side by side.
