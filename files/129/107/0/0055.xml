A POLICY FOR WAGES, SALARIES AND OTHER INCOMESREPORT BY SIR FRANK LEEThe Chancellor of the Exchequer knows that during recent weeks I havebeen presiding over an interdepartmental group of officials consisting of membersof the Treasury, together with the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry ofLabour, Board of Trade, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of power, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Aviation, Ministry of Housing andLocal Government and the General Post Office. The Scottish Office have been kept informed of the group&apos;s work. We have been working on the preparationof a draft statement for the Government to issue about future policy on wages andother incomes i.e., the long-term policy of trying to secure the more satisfactorycontinuing relationship between incomes and productivity which we want to seefollow the wages pause.2. It has been quite a gruelling business to prepare such a draft statement,since the subject matter is both complex and controversial, and it is far from easy to set out something which will be politically viable in a free society, will standsome chance of acceptance by both sides of industry, and yet will go beyond beingjust another piece of exhortation about the virtues of restraint.3. We have now agreed upon the draft which is attached below it is in theform of a possible White Paper and submit it for the consideration of Ministers.I ought to emphasise that we are all conscious that the drafting, and perhaps indeed in places the substance could have been much better had we continued to work on it longer. In particular some of us would have wished for more time to considerparticular problems e.g., possible procedures designed to improve the mobility of labour while all of us would have aimed at trying to simplify the languagein certain parts of the draft (though that is not easy). But we have felt thatthe right course was not to let the best be the enemy of the good but rather to letMinisters see the draft at its present stage so as to give them time for full discussionof it between themselves and opportunity for later amendation as necessary.4. Perhaps I should now make some comments on the substance of the draft.The following are the main points to which I should wish to invite attention:(a) The basic purpose is to issue a &quot; guiding light&quot; in terms that theGovernments view is that, at any rate for the next two or three years,an average rate of increase of total money incomes per head of2\ per cent, a year &quot; is as much as is consistent with a healthy and competitive economy &quot;.This guidance cannot be satisfactorily expressed in a singlesentence: the &quot; spelling out &quot; of the guidance in paragraphs 11 and 12of the draft is of crucial importance. In these paragraphs weendeavour to make it clear that (i) we want the combined effect ofnational, local and individual plant settlements to be taken into account,and not only national agreements; (ii) we do not want undue rigidity orto exclude changes in relativities which may be necessary to securemovements of labour between industries and therefore a better useof manpower resources.(b) We describe the &quot; safe &quot; increase of 2\ per cent, as an average.   Thedifficulty may well be to find industries or trade unions ready to agreethat they should be content to have wage increases below the average:in other words there is the risk that what is intended (and represented)as an average may in practice become a minimum claimed by all (withthe more prosperous industries or the stronger trade unions pressing forawards well in excess of the average figure). There is no &quot; built-in &quot;way of escape that we can think of for such a danger. But how seriousthe danger is in practice will depend on what is the general pressureSECRETANNEX A
of demand which the Government allows to operate in the economy!!and on the broad reception of the policy by industry and the public at large.(c) We do not consider that anything in the nature of sanctions will be practicable if industries or firms give increases which are out of line with the Governmenfs guidance. But the hope will be that the pressure of public opinion and the fact that the Governmenfs consideredadvice would have been deliberately flouted will in fact operate tosecure a greater sense of restraint than would have been the case hadno guidance existed. This may operate all the more if (i) the idea gainsground that there must be a public and manifest statement of reasons tojustify any significant departure from the guidance; (ii) the Governmentare themselves prepared to pass judgment in individual cases; and (iii)an annual report is issued on the general success or otherwise of thepolicy (as we envisage).(d) So far as the public services are concerned, we have sought (in paragraph 17of the draft) to make it clear that the Government will follow the guidance &quot; in the settlement of wages and salaries for which they have responsibility &quot;, but to indicate that, given the general principle of&quot; comparability &quot; (which we reaffirm), the guidance can only prevailin the public services if it is applied by those responsible for the determination of remuneration elsewhere. In short, if there is a generaldeparture from the guidance on the part of &quot; outside &quot; industry we shallnot be able to continue to apply it to the public services alone.(e) The passages on profits and prices (paragraphs 18-22) are of greatimportance. We say that there can be no question of the imposition by government of limitations on the profits of individual industries orfirms, or on the dividends paid by them. But we propose that theGovernment, as a counterpart to the restraint which the drafturges should be accepted by wage and salary earners, should accept a commitment &quot; to keep aggregate profits from increasingdisproportionately as compared with aggregate pay over a period ofyears &quot;, and an obligation, if that position were found to obtain, totake corrective action in the fiscal or other fields (e.g., by an appropriateadjustment of taxation).This would be a far-reaching and significant new commitment but we are convinced that it would be both right in itself as a counterpartto what is proposed in the wage/salary field, and necessary on broad&quot; political &quot; grounds if we are to secure general acceptance of the new policy.We have added two paragraphs of importance (paragraphs 21 and22) urging on managements the importance of ensuring that the benefits of the more favourable trend in labour costs if the policy succeedsshould be reflected rapidly in prices rather than enhanced profits.(/) There are alternative versions of the passage on arbitration (paragraphs 16and 16a). The Ministry of Labour whose views on this subject mustof course carry great weight because of their direct responsibilities inthe field of labour relations feel it to be undesirable to go beyondthe second version and think that any reference in this context to the guidance policy would be misunderstood.Both versions assume that the Minister of Labour will be issuingsimultaneously (or soon after the wages and incomes statement) aseparate White Paper on possible changes in arbitration arrangements.It may well be desirable to defer a decision about what is said aboutarbitration in the statement on wages, etc., until more is known aboutthe scope and content of the separate White Paper on this subject.5. We are all conscious of doubts and difficulties about the policy implicit inthe draft. It will almost certainly be attacked in various quarters as imperfect,or unduly timid, or as being impossible of fulfilment. But we cannot see anyother line of approach which would, in our judgment, be practicable. And webelieve that if the Government could get public opinion (and reasonable men on
FRANK LEE.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th November, 1961.appendix draft STATEMENT ON A POLICY FOR WAGES, SALARIES, ANDOTHER incomes in his statement of 25th July the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that apause in increases in wages, salaries and other incomes was essential as a basis for continued prosperity and growth. He recognised that such a pause could not provide a lasting solution to the problem of rising costs and prices and that methodsmust be worked out to secure a sensible long-term relationship between increases in incomes of all sorts and increases in productivity. This is a crucial problem for our country and the Government think it is their duty to give guidance now about the relationship between incomes and national productivity at which itis necessary to aim.background. The Government accept as fundamental that an excessive level of demand in the economy would be bound to jeopardise any attempt to prevent excessiverises in incomes: and it will be their continuing aim to avoid this. As anothercontribution to the establishment of a satisfactory relationship between incomes and production the Chancellor envisaged a more purposeful planning of our national resources and the participation of both sides of industry in the task ofrelating plans for expansion to the resources likely to be available. discussions between the Government and both sides of industry about the setting up of aNational Economic Development Council are in progress and the Governmentare confident that such a Council could play a decisive role in giving a newstimulus to the growth of our economy.3. We cannot, however, rely on a more rapid growth in production by itselfto bring about a realistic relationship between incomes and productivity. In somepost-war years we have had a high rate of expansion but it has been accompaniedby an even higher rate of growth in incomes. Post-war experience suggests thatthere is an inherent tendency, under present arrangements and with a high levelof employment, for money incomes to grow faster than the volume of national production. This conclusion emerges from examination of the trends of incomes and national production in the post-war period. It is illustrated by the movementin the various factors over the period from 1953 (by which time post-warcomplications had been largely eliminated; to 1960. The main facts are that between 1953 and 1960:(i) Total domestic output of goods and services rose by 3 per cent, a year.But the labour force rose by 0-6 per cent, a year, so that output per head rose by about 2-3 per cent.* a year.* This figure is based on statistics of output. An alternative calculation based on statistics of expenditure would give a lower figure about 1-9 per cent, per annum.SECRET60062 b 2both sides of industry) to accept the policy as fair, it should give us a better hopeof securing restraint in wage settlements than we have had before in the post-war period. But it will not be a panacea or an alternative to the right policies elsewhere.Above all, it will not work if the pressure of internal demand is allowed to becometoo great: employers and workers cannot in the nature of things be expected toexercise restraint, whatever guidance is given to them, if they know that wage increases can be passed on without difficulty in a booming home market as sir Robert Hall said in his recent Economist articles &quot; Excess demand will killany policy . . . &quot;.
(ii) Total income from employment rose by 6-7 per cent, a year.   Wagesand salaries per head rose by 5 - 8 per cent, a year.(iii) The total of all other domestic incomes, including profits of public and private concerns, rose by 6-2 per cent, per annum. Inside this total,the trading profits of companies and public enterprises rose at a rateof 6-9 per cent, per annum.(iv) The prices of the goods and services that make up total domestic outputrose on the average by 3 - 3 per cent, a year.4. These figures show clearly that incomes from employment and profitshave both been rising more than twice as fast as production. To put it another way, since 1953 incomes have risen by about  8,000 millions while domestic production, in real terms, has risen only by about  3,400 millions. The result hasbeen a continuing rise in the level of prices. This excessive rise in incomes andthe rise in prices, which inevitably accompanied it, has brought lasting advantage to no substantial section of the community; and it has done damage to all. Ifmoney incomes had risen more slowly, real incomes the amount of goods and services we are able to buy with our money could have risen faster and weshould have had all the advantages that come from preserving the value of ourcurrency.5. The record of the period suggests also that the rate of increase in realwages and salaries per head is substantially governed by the rate of increase in productivity. It is true that in the period real wages increased by 3 - 4 per cent,and so at a rather faster rate than output per head. But this was only because ofa large change in our favour in the terms on which we obtained our imports fromabroad. We cannot count on this in future; in fact, things might very well gothe other way. The record also suggests that over a long period profit incomesas a whole grew much faster than production and nearly as fast as total wagesand salaries. Rising wages and salaries did not to any appreciable extent come out of profits: indeed profit margins seem to have been little affected.6. Each successive move towards higher money incomes was doubtlessregarded as justifiable by those immediately concerned on grounds of social justiceor economic efficiency. But the total effect has been damaging socially and economically. On the one hand are all the injustices and distortions that go with inflation. On the other, is the persistent and cumulative weakening in our competitive power that results from the upward pressure put upon our costs and prices. Rising costs and incomes have diverted goods from export and have contributed to our periodic balance of payments difficulties and made it necessaryto take measures restrictive of economic growth. So, too much success in increasing money incomes has resulted in recurrent checks and a smaller increasein real incomes than would otherwise have been possible.A Basis for the Future7. It would be much better if stability in costs and prices allowed us tomaintain a steady pressure of demand, without those interruptions which destroy the momentum of expansion. The more the Government can count on collectiveassent to moderate increases in money incomes, in keeping with the actual growth in national productivity, the stronger will be our balance of payments and thehigher the level of economic activity and employment which it will be possibleto maintain.8. Concerted action and co-operation among all sections of the communityare essential if we are to make effective the general desire for high levels ofemployment, a more rapid rate of growth and stable prices. If we are to succeed,everybody who influences or decides the course of wages, salaries, profit-marginsand prices must know what decisions are likely to be consistent with the objectives. Those who are ready to co-operate will also need to feel assuredagainst the possibility that their restraint will be exploited by others.9. The average increase in domestic output per head in recent years hasbeen in the region of 2 per cent, a year. We have still to reap the advantage of themore rapid growth of our industrial capacity in recent years: and we must look for benefits also from a reduction of practices which impede growth, in both sides of industry. But it will be some time before there is clear evidence that a higher rate of growth in production has been achieved and can be sustained.  There is
Wages and Salaries11. The application of the above guidance to increases in wages and salarieshas to be related to the conditions and agreements existing in particular industries and areas: it is for employers and employees to work out the specific application.It means broadly, however, that the general level of effective rates i.e., thoserates on which earnings for a given time or a given piece of work are actuallycalculated should not be raised by more than 2\ per cent, per annum: and thatpayments under particular agreements (e.g., related to the cost of living) and reductions in hours or other improvements in pay should be included in the reckoning. The guidance relates to the combined effects of national, local, and particular settlements which determine these effective rates. Where basic ratesnegotiated under national agreements are subject to supplements under local or particular agreements, this ought to be taken into account in the variousnegotiations.12. This guidance does not imply that each and every employee shouldannually receive an increase of 2\ per cent.: it is not intended as a minimum towhich employees are entitled irrespective of the financial state of the industry inwhich they work. It is an average more than some will be able to obtain and lessthan others ought to obtain. Nor does the guidance imply that it is either necessary or desirable that increases in all wages and salaries in all industries should happenevery year or at the same time. The timing of increases in the various industries and the distribution of increases among the various categories of workers in each industry are matters for settlement in the light of particular circumstances.Moreover settlements are already in some cases at longer intervals than one year:and this practice can be helpful to stability.13. The Government recognise that from time to time changes in relativitiesin wages and salaries are needed to assist in securing a better distribution of manpower and that increases significantly different from the average may on occasion be justified. But the whole basis of this guidance would be underminedif such special increases were widespread or numerous. Workers, who themselvesaccept moderate settlements on the lines suggested, may reasonably ask that thegrounds for special increases in other cases of significance should be establishedmanifestly and publicly. The Government think that in such cases those who areresponsible for the settlement should accept an obligation to make public the reasonsfor it. The same considerations apply in the converse direction i.e., where thereis a case for a significantly lower rate of increase than the normal.14. In a fully employed economy there are bound to be scarcities of manykinds of labour. Such scarcities do not of themselves justify above-normal increases in wages. A case for an abnormal increase exists only if the manpower in theindustry concerned needs to be increased relatively to others, or if a decline, whichwould otherwise take place, must be prevented. Claims not having this justification,but based only on general arguments such as the trend of the cost of living, ontrends of profits or productivity in the particular industry, or on claims to aparticular place in the league table of earnings should not be regarded as warrantingan above-normal increase. Such increases should be confined to a few genuinelyexceptional cases, e.g., where productivity increases are closely linked with personaleffort, and could not be appropriate in a settlement covering a sector with a veryalso a long way to go before our exports have reached the volume required to restore our balance of payments to a satisfactory position, and this can only beachieved if our costs and prices remain fully competitive. Against this backgroundit is the Governments view that over the next two or three years a rate of increaseof total money incomes per head of 2% per cent, a year is as much as is consistent with a healthy and competitive economy. Indeed this rate of increase is greaterthan the historical record would itself justify and is in anticipation of a betterperformance which concerted effort ought to secure.10. This view is based on the Governments present assessment of the likelyaverage rate of increase in national productivity over a period of years. In thenature of things, however, the rate of increase in national productivity is boundto fluctuate from year to year: and it would not be right to vary a long-term viewmerely because of such fluctuations. The Government propose, however, thatthe suggested rate of increase should be reviewed from time to time in the lightof achievements, the changing trends of growth, and other relevant matters.
large number of persons engaged in various activities which present widely different^manpower problems.  A special importance attaches to those industries in whichsettlements of wages and salaries may set a general pattern: and this applies to nationalised industries as well as industries in the private sector.15. The Government ask that all negotiations and settlements affecting wagesand salaries should be on the basis indicated above. The effectiveness of theseproposals depends heavily upon the willingness of workers not to press claims which go beyond the limits indicated. Since wages and salaries are a largeproportion of total incomes and since increases in pay do not, in general, come outof profit incomes, an above-normal increase obtained by one set of workers isultimately paid for in the main by their fellow-workers. This consideration shouldhave a restraining effect on those who are in a strong bargaining position. the effectiveness of the proposals depends also upon the co-operation of employers and upon their ability to ensure that moderation in collectively-negotiated settlementsis not frustrated in its effects by individual bidding-up of individual wage and salaryrates.16. The Government attach the highest value to arbitration and similarprocesses whereby otherwise insoluble disputes about wages and salaries havegenerally been settled without resort to strikes: and they consider it desirable thatarbitration by well-informed and independent arbitrators should continue to beavailable and to be used for this purpose. They recognise too that settlements atarbitration have generally in the past reflected a pattern of settlements which has emerged from direct negotiations. A separate White Paper will be issued aboutways in which the processes of arbitration can operate most effectively in future soas to ensure that, in this field, as in other parts of the wage-settlement machinery,regard is had to the guidance given above.16a. [Alternative.] The Government attach the highest value to thearrangements whereby intractable disputes about wages and salaries can be settled by reference to well-informed independent arbitrators. It is essential that these arrangements should continue to be available. A further White Paper will deal withthe ways in which the processes of arbitration can operate most effectively in thefuture.17. In the summer of 1961 the Government took special steps to ensure thatthe pause in wage and salary increases was achieved in the Civil Service and other employments where they were directly responsible. They did so because, in theserious situation then obtaining, they thought it their duty in the national interest togive a lead to all others responsible for determining wages and salaries. This was an act for the short-term and cannot persist in the long-term where policy must haveregard to the Governmenfs responsibility for securing and maintaining an adequatestaff for the efficient running of the services concerned. In the long-term it wouldbe neither fair to the employees as individuals, nor consistent with the Governmenfsresponsibility for wages and salaries in direct Government control to be fixed ona basis demonstrably more restrictive than in the other employments in this country,private or nationalised. In the Civil Service, with its great variety of work,remuneration must be related to that paid for similar work elsewhere: it is neitherright nor practicable to continue for long paying a tradesman employed by theGovernment less than the rate settled generally for that trade; the pay of a clerkin the Government service must be in a reasonable relationship with that of thosedoing clerical work elsewhere. In other public services where the Government hasresponsibilities for settling pay, the work done may have no counterpart elsewhere.Nevertheless (without necessarily accepting the refinements of &quot; comparability &quot;which have been suggested from time to time), the general level of the remunerationin those services cannot be isolated from that elsewhere. Thus the principlesoutlined in the preceding paragraphs can reasonable prevail in these services only if they are applied by those responsible for the determination of remunerationelsewhere. Subject to this, the Government will have regard to these principles inthe settlement of wages and salaries for which they have responsibility.Profits and Prices18. Wages and salaries are the main element in our home costs and in the priceof the national output. Of the other income elements which are in aggregateequivalent to about one-half of the wages and salaries bill, the profits of companies,firms and individuals are the main item.   The Government accept that the
counterpart of the proposed policy for wages and salaries must be a policy designedto keep aggregate profits from increasing disproportionately as compared withaggregate pay over a period of years. Procedures, however, will have to reflect the differences in the nature of these two items.19. Profits generally are much more subject to rapid and wide fluctuationsthan wages. In seeking to preserve a reasonable balance between aggregate profits and aggregate pay, regard should therefore be had to trends over a period. profits and margins, moreover, inevitably vary among industries and among firms.A standard limit on profits or dividends would penalise the efficient and enterprisingconcerns and industries and impair their ability to get the capital they need for expansion, while it would leave inefficient and stagnating concerns unaffected.Such standardisation would, therefore, be the negation of a policy to stimulateeconomic growth. It would be particularly damaging to penalise the more efficientconcerns by discouraging increases in profits which arise out of a combination of reduced margins and higher turnover.20. The Government propose to discuss with both sides of industry in theNational Economic Development Council how these aggregates should be defined,what categories of income they should cover and other matters relevant to obtaining a fair and reasonable picture of the working out of the proposed policies. Theycontemplate also that the Council could keep under review the trends in these various elements in the national income and consider from time to time whetherdisproportionate increases in profits or pay threaten the objectives of the policy.In particular, if such a review established that aggregate profits were increasingdisproportionately as compared with wages and salaries, the Council would beable to propose to the Government remedial measures to redress the balance andthe Government would not hesitate to take corrective action in the fiscal orother fields.21. The purpose which the Government have in mind is to secure stability in the general level of our home costs and thus to promote stability in our generalprice level. It is, therefore, clearly preferable that disproportionate increases in aggregate profits should be avoided through the price mechanism rather thancorrected through taxation. The Government believe that the forces of competition,in combination with the policies they now propose, would in fact produce thenecessary price adjustments. If growth in aggregate pay is kept in step with national production, this would in itself provide stability in the general level oflabour costs: and the forces of competition should eventually ensure that thebenefits of this are passed on in prices and not absorbed by increased profit margins.This means that there should be price reductions in those industries whereproductivity increases more rapidly than the national average. Only thus can there be compensation for those cases where productivity increases are inevitably lessthan the national average and where in consequence increases in wages at thenational average rate lead to price increases.22. Moreover, the Government would expect managements, in the new circumstances, to regard themselves as being under a special obligation to see thatthe benefits arising from the more favourable trend in their labour costs arerapidly reflected in their prices. Such action would be in the interests of themore efficient concerns which could then grow more rapidly: it would be in thenational interest which requires competitiveness in pricing, and it would be inthe interests of industry as a whole in so far as it would obviate the need for resort to direct action to curb profits. The Government propose to maintain a watchon progress towards the greater competitiveness in pricing which is required underthe new policies and they will continue and, if necessary, develop the special arrangements that already exist for this in areas where competition is limitedthrough the existence of monopolies or restrictive trade practices.Conclusion23. The Government are aware that this policy for incomes marks a major change from the previous attitudes of Governments of every party: and that it involves modification in traditional attitudes and practices of employers and employees. Its provisions, both in respect of wage arid salary incomes and inrespect of income from capital will require more detailed working out withrepresentatives of employers and employees in an atmosphere of openmindedness
and freedom from prejudice.   The Government believe that some of the essenti;conditions are now favourable to a change. The steeply rising trend of wages and salaries ended some months ago and the consequential increases in costs have nowbeen substantially absorbed in prices or otherwise: profits and profit margins havefallen from the high levels attained in 1960. There are now substantial elements of stability in the situation which provide a good base for a fresh start. Widespreadincreases in money incomes on a scale greater than that indicated whether theyare based on changes in the cost of living since the last increase or on other grounds would set off again the spiral of rising costs and prices. On the other hand, ifthe growth of money incomes can be limited in the way suggested, there are good prospects that our general price level will settle down and that the moderateincreases in money incomes now proposed will in fact also be increases in realincomes.24. The Government believe that the effective application of these policiesrequires that the community generally should be kept well informed about progress.They have it in mind, therefore, to place before Parliament and the country periodicreports, in a White Paper or otherwise, on the working out of this policy in all its aspects.25. It is an affront to the national common sense to operate the system underwhich incomes are settled so that we pay ourselves incomes wages, salaries and profits far in excess of what we have earned in national productivity. It is not within the power of the Government alone to put this right: nor can theGovernment by sanctions compel sensible behaviour in the field. But the penalties of continuing in our present way are clear enough, erosion of our competitive power and our ability to pay our way in the world, the dwindling valueof our money and the continuing threat to standards of life and employment inthe country. On the other hand the rewards of an effective application of theproposed policy would be great and would accrue to all sections of the community.It should make possible the preservation of stable prices and the maintenance ofthe real value of pensions and of personal savings, and it would open up theprospect of a more rapid and sustainable advance in our production and in realwages and other incomes, while maintaining high levels of employment and a steady value for our money. Attainment of this objective requires concerted action by Government and by both sides of industry and the support of the community as a whole.   This is the basis and intention of the Governments proposals.November 1961.
ANNEX BINCOMES POLICYViews of the Minister Without Portfolio1. The Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) do not assume responsibility for wage settlements and it is doubtful whether the Trade Unions, large and small,would agree that they should.2. Since the war the doctrine of &quot; comparability &quot; has been advanced and given form by Reports such as those by the Priestley and Guillebaud Committees.This doctrine is not confined to a comparison of rates but covers a comparison of earnings.3. Each section of employment claims that it is undermanned or losinglabour and that it is necessary to pay higher wages to stop this process.4. In time of full employment this means that wages and salaries areadvanced both by agreements negotiated with the Trade Unions but also to alarge extent by the action of employers in individual firms to keep or expandtheir labour forces.5. The extent and the effect of this practice has, I suggest, been entirelyoverlooked in the submission in Annex A.6. I have looked into the experiences of the engineering and allied industries which includes engineering and electrical goods, shipbuilding and marine engineering, vehicles and metal goods.7. From May 1957 to December 1960, national rate increases amounted to26s. lOd. per week or 16 per cent, over the 1956 rates in the case of skilled men,and hours were reduced from 44 to 42 per week.8. In the same period earnings advanced by 74s. 8^d. or 44 per cent, fortimeworkers and 81s. 11 Id. or 49 per cent, for payment by result workers.9.   So far as unskilled workers were concerned the figures were as follows:National rate increases: 16 per cent. (22s. 6d.)Earnings increases: timeworkers 40 per cent. (56s. 4d.)payment by result workers 40 per cent. (56s. 10^d.)10. It is interesting to note that between June 1959 and June 1960, duringwhich period there was no National Rate Increase, the following increases in average earnings took place:11. In this context the proposal that settlements over the next two years should be limited to any average increase of total money incomes per head of2\ per cent, per year and that those who are responsible for settlements of a greatermagnitude should accept an obligation to make public the reasons for it, does notsmack of reality. The increases which I have quoted above take place by actionin thousands of firms throughout the industry.Class of LabourPayment byTimeworkers   Result WorkersFitters (skilled)    .......Turners and skilled machinistsMachinists (semi-skilled) ...Toolroom fitters and turnersPatternmakers     ......Sheet metal workersMoulders (loose pattern) ...Platers, riveters and caulkersLabourers......All above classes  ...7-01 7-749-46 11-177-76 7-047-08 7-0411-20 6-627-06 10-7411-73 12-9211-63 9-217-85 9-187-52 8-52
12. From my experience of wage negotiations, I share the fears expressed inparagraph 4 (b) of Sir Frank Lee&apos;s report of 9th November, 1961, that:(a) The workers in any industry will not be content to go below the average figure.(b) The average would become the minimum claimed by all and consideredtoo low by most.13. I do not believe for a minute that the Trade Unions will follow a &quot; guidinglight &quot; to which they are not a party, and that any attempt to introduce it will leadto further non-co-operation in wage problems.14. It is rather noteworthy that where attempts have been made to confinewage alterations to cost of living figures they have seldom been so confined.Building labour is an outstanding case.15. We do not know whether any agreement would be possible in the proposedEconomic Development Council to make recommendations on these matters. Ifthe Council is composed of individuals selected for their worth I suspect their advicewill go the way of that from the Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomes.16. If on the other hand it is composed of representatives of the Employersand the T.U.C. it is doubtful if the latter will ever assume the responsibility ofpronouncing on these matters on behalf of the mass of Trade Unions.17. I do not believe that sanctions against individuals or Trade Unions orfirms for breaching the &quot; guiding light &quot; is a practical possibility any more thanin my view is the &quot; guiding light &quot; itself.18. I do however agree that excessive wages, salaries and profits areresponsible for inflation more than any other factor and that therefore the problem should be considered within the proposed Economic Development Council, if this can be arranged.19. As regards profits, any plan concerned with profits should not injure the chances of a Company recovering its proper profit position nor expanding its profitsif this is justified by extra effort, greater efficiency, more sales or additional capital.I do not believe that measures should be taken against individual companies.20. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has available a simple control. If profits and dividends as a whole get out of hand, a variation in profits tax, perhapsdistinguishing between distributed and undistributed profits, should keep theposition under control.21. I am of the opinion that the papers before us do not contain an acceptablesolution of the problem we are considering.M.Office of the Minister Without Portfolio, S.W. 1.

This would enable breaches of the Governments wage policy to be punished by the ordinary processes of law i.e., with sentences of fines or imprisonment, or both, on the parties responsible for any settlement in breach ofthe policy. There would no doubt have to be something like a special Wages court to adjudicate on such cases which would have the power, in appropriate instances,to authorise settlements at divergence with the guiding light.3. This would obviously be a revolutionary step, implying complete control ofthe economy by Government (including the control of profits, dividends, etc.)and would involve far-reaching and most contentious legislation. From aneconomic standpoint it would mean a &quot; frozen &quot; economy. (It would have toensure that the prohibition of wage increases beyond a given limit was not by-passed by fringe benefits shorter hours, generous holidays, payments in kind,and the like: this is a problem which would arise in connexion with any formof sanction.)Some Form of &quot; Collective &quot; Sanction4. In the draft statement proposed by officials, the suggestion was made that &quot; if such a review established that aggregate profits (over a reasonable period)were increasing disproportionately as compared with wages and salaries, theCouncil would be able to propose to the Government remedial measures to redressthe balance and the Government would not hesitate to take corrective action inthe fiscal or other fields &quot;. It is to be noted that this suggestion (which, broadly speaking, would involve an undertaking to secure a redistribution of the national income, if necessary) has been proposed as part of the broad bargain between theGovernment and both sides of industry envisaged as the necessary backgroundfor the new wage policy. It is not contemplated as being a sanction for breaches of that policy. Nevertheless it could be argued that, by a sort of analogy, if after a given period (say a year) the overall rise in wages as a whole had exceeded theaverage indicated in the &quot; guiding light&quot; some additional taxation should be imposed specifically designed as a &quot; penalty &quot; because of the failure to observe the &quot; guiding light &quot; the primary objective being to focus public attention on thegreat significance attached by the Government to its wage policy.5. The following considerations would have to be considered in connexionwith any such proposal:(a) Incomes from employment are a very large item in the national income more than four times as large as profits. Thus even the &quot; excess &quot;increase in a given year over the &quot; guiding light&quot; might run to verylarge figures and, if the whole or a large part of it were all taken away,this would tend to distort the budget.(b) Any additional taxation should in theory apply to those sections of thecommunity who by and large have failed to exercise moderation. this might point to a levy by, say, an increase in the employee^ national
3I5Qinsurance contribution. But (i) this would hit all employees everywhere!&quot;including the self-employed; (ii) in some cases employers might be as&quot; culpable &quot; as employees; (iii) if the general &quot; excess &quot; were large, itwould be necessary to look to other fields of taxation (e.g., purchase tax) for the recoupment. But this would bear on the general body oftaxpayers (including pensioners and others with fixed incomes).(c) If increases in wages and other incomes resulted in inflation, somedeflationary action would have to be taken anyway and it might wellbe difficult to identify particular budgetary measures with the failure to observe the &quot; guiding light &quot;.(d) Wages might reasonably be expected to increase regularly from year to year, but profit trends can be sensibly gauged only over a period.This would mean that action in relation to wages would be taken morepromptly than in relation to profits, and would give an impression ofinequality of treatment.(e) Taxation, if it can be made to bite quickly enough, may remove excessdemand arising from excessive wages: but it does not deal with thefundamental problem of costs which will have risen with the excessivewages: indeed it may make that problem worse.Sanctions for Particular Breaches6. The question here is whether action could be taken against industries,firms or persons responsible for a manifest breach of the guidance.7. The first problem would be to identify those breaches which justified theimposition of sanctions. This would be easier if the guidance were in very simpleand firm terms, e.g., that there should in no circumstances be wage increasesgreater than, say, 2\ per cent. (This would either lead, if successful, to the&quot; frozen &quot; economy to which reference has already been made; alternatively, therewould be wholesale evasion because of the difficulties of definition and enforcement.)8. If the policy were more flexible (as has been proposed in the draft statement) it would be necessary for Government to judge in any individual casewhether the breach had been sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of sanctions. This would involve difficult discriminatory action.9. Leaving aside the possibility of punishment by way of direct fines onpersons responsible for settlements in breach of the guidance, sanctions might takethe following forms:(a) It could be provided that industries or firms paying wages in excess of the&quot; guiding light&quot; should not have any allowance for tax purposes inrespect of the excess or part of the excess.This would involve (i) the deliberate use of the tax system as apunitive instrument, (ii) great difficulties in the measurement of theamounts to be disallowed and in securing broadly uniform treatmentthroughout the country (iii) difficult acts of judgment in borderlinecases, (iv) some substantial increase in the bureaucratic machine to administer these provisions if they were exercised widely.(b) The Government could take steps to disallow the excess (or part of it) in wage settlements going beyond the guidance in the computation of grants (e.g., to local authorities), subsidies (e.g., to agriculture), or pricespayable under Governmental contracts.This would involve the same difficulties of measurement anduniformity of treatment as in (a), and could in practice only be operatedif some general sanctions (e.g., price control) were being appliedthroughout the economy.(c) It might be possible to devise some measures of price control applicable tothe products of an industry in which &quot; excessive &quot; wages increases had occurred.&quot; The translation &quot; of any excess into terms of prices of productswould be very difficult and arbitrary. The general objections to asystem of price control (rigidity, harmful standardisation of product,
Nationalised Industries11. There is also the question of nationalised industries in relation to a&quot; guiding light &quot; policy, i.e., how could the policy be enforced? The real questionhere is not legal powers which might well be adequate to secure that the boards should take certain specific factors into account when considering wage claims.e.g., the &quot; guiding light&quot;: it is a question of substance. Public intervention by ministers by means of a direction about the timing or amount of increases would bring the Government into direct conflict with the unions. The unions might wellrefuse to negotiate with the Nationalised Boards on the ground that they were notplenipotentiaries and the Government would be brought directly into wage negotiations. There could be great difficulties, especially if the question of strikesarose. Moreover, it seems questionable how far the Boards would be prepared toabdicate their responsibility for the management of this part of the industries&apos;business. The sanctions of taxation or price control are of no value here: none of these industries in fact pay tax and the effect of any action in regard to tax or price control would fall ultimately upon the Exchequer.Experience in Other Countries12. The Appendix contains some brief notes about the situation in certain other countries. In many countries where there are sanctions available to theGovernment these rest on a labour law laying down methods of procedure and providing a legal basis for wage agreements and arbitration awards. This means that breaches of wage agreements can be more easily established and can been forced by penalties on either party. The agreements reached by collective bargaining in Britain on the other hand are not legally binding and the procedure is a matter for private agreement.13. In some countries it is possible to operate a general wage policy becauseof a highly centralised system of wage bargaining, and the prior existence of a formal pact between the organisations representing employers and employed. Thesituation in Sweden, for example, is governed by the Saltsjobaden Agreement of1938 (which took 2\ years to negotiate); in Switzerland there was theFriedensvertrag in 1936; in the Netherlands the Foundation of Labour goes backto the war. There is in those countries an underlying force of opinion that limits the freedom of the two parties, but which has no counterpart in Britain as yet.Basis of Officials&apos; Draft14. It may be helpful to Ministers if we set out the basis upon which thestatement (the Appendix to Annex A) was drafted.   We approached the problempossibility of evasion, and so on) would apply. And inasmuch as thecontrol would have to apply to all products of the same kind, it wouldbite on the just and the unjust alike. (It would be out of the question to control the prices of the products of individual firms, except wherethey had a monopoly.) In any event this form of sanction wouldpenalise only the employers, leaving the employees untouched a consideration which applies also to the other forms of &quot; individual&quot;sanction.Arbitration10. Arbitration at present is voluntary and is used only when both parties agree to use it. It would be boycotted if an effective statutory limit were placedon arbitration awards: so, if it continued to be desirable to use arbitration as a means of settling disputes, it would be necessary to make arbitration compulsory.This would seem to involve defining those increases which were permissible without going to arbitration and making illegal (with penalties) increases beyond thisexcept when given through an arbitration court. It would be necessary too to lay down precise rules of guidance for the arbitrators, and to secure in one way or another that they did not depart from these even inside a stipulated maximumfigure. In the end the system which would emerge would be nothing like arbitrationas it is understood in this country. It would be substantially the fixing of wagesby decree, apparently the decree of a wages court, but in practice (and as it wouldappear to industry) by decree of the Government. No doubt there would be pressure for similar legal restraints on the earnings of capital.
AppendixSANCTIONS BEHIND WAGES POLICIES IN OTHER COUNTRIESNetherlandsIn the Netherlands the Board of Mediators (appointed by the Ministry of LocalAffairs) has in theory had the power to establish the general principles governingwage changes, to validate collective agreements, to fix general wage levels and toestablish differentials. In practice the Board has not been able to do any of these things in defiance of the wishes of the two main contracting parties, and has tended to do little more than ratify the agreements reached by the Federation of Labour a bipartite body representing employers&apos; organisations and the unions. TheGovernment have therefore had to exercise influence mainly by demonstrating tothe Federation the consequences for the country as a whole of collective agreements on wage increases that were larger than the increase in national productivity. this government influence has for the most part been relatively successful, particularly at times when prices were rising and there was trouble with the balance of payments.In 1951 and again in 1956 the unions agreed to wage increases small enough to imply a temporary cut in the real standard of living in order to prevent increases in wage-costs pushing up prices even further. In 1957, as part of a wage stabilisationprogramme, employers agreed not to raise their prices without Governmentpermission. On the other hand there have been times when, with a very highpressure of demand, employers on the Federation did not find it worth their while to argue strongly against excessive wage claims, and the resulting increases in wagesreached by collective agreement were higher than the Government wished.The ability of the Government to control movements in the overall level ofwages has also been limited by the existence of wage drift. In years of excessivepressure of demand this has tended to be fairly substantial, though in some cases it has subsequently been consolidated into the centrally agreed rates. This hasoccurred in spite of the detailed (centrally-agreed) system of job evaluation, whichdifferentiates between different skills and areas, though it may have been somewhatmodified by it. Although because of the central discussions employers may have felt a greater need to disguise the nature of extra payments to their workers thanthey have in the United Kingdom, it seems clear that the Government have notcin the belief that an attempt to provide sanctions against deviations from th&amp;guidance given by the Government would inevitably lead towards a fully controlledeconomy, or would be likely to jeopardise the broad acceptance of the new policy by the community as a whole and by both sides of industry an acceptance onwhich the effectiveness of the policy will depend. The new and valuable elementwould be the public enunciation by Government for the first time of what wasconsidered a tolerable rate of increase in incomes: this would provide a frameworkinside which bargaining could take place and a yardstick against which the resultsof such bargaining could be judged. If there were extravagant settlements inparticular industries the parties to the settlement would be seen to have floutedGovernmental advice given in the interests of the whole community and wouldhave to stand in the dock of public opinion accordingly. If representatives of employees or employers could be persuaded to accept or acquiesce in this idea inprinciple it would be a major step towards controlling wage inflation. We thoughton the other hand that a precipitate move towards reforming the whole structure of wages settlements would build up such resistance that it would prejudice theprospects of success for the new policies. We were, therefore, aiming at a policywhich would facilitate the carry-over of as much as possible of the goodwill fromthe old system of collective bargaining and arbitration without, however,perpetuating the disadvantages in the way of wages inflation or provokingopposition to what were thought to be fundamental changes in the position of thetrade unions. We recognise that any enunciation by Government of a &quot; guidinglight &quot; is likely to expose Ministers to pressure to express a judgment on particularsettlements in the private as well as the public sector. This may involve political embarrassment, but it may well be inescapable if public opinion is to be mobilisedand maintained in support of a wages policy.November 1961
een able to invoke any really effective sanctions against wage drift. Recentlyattempts have been made by central agreement, to limit wage increases more directly to increases in productivity in the particular industry concerned, but this may creategrievances in the sectors where productivity increases relatively slowly, withoutfully preventing wage drift in places or occupations where there are shortages of skilled labour.australia in Australia disputes which cannot be settled by the parties concerned, or withthe aid of a conciliator, can be referred by either party to the CommonwealthConciliation and Arbitration Commission, whose decisions are binding and legally enforceable on all parties concerned whether or not they were represented at thehearings. The Commission will not normally listen to claims while a union is on strike.The Commission holds annual hearings on whether and by how much theFederal Basic Wage should be increased; and from time to time it considers whetherchanges should be made in the various margins allowed for various types of skill.Until fairly recently the Commission^ decisions do not appear to have been taken on grounds that would satisfy the requirements of overall price stability. But in1960 the Government represented to the Commission their own view that theeconomic circumstances of the country did not justify any increase in the basicwage, and the Commission^ decision concurred with this view.Australia also has a wage-drift problem, though it seems that it may be rather less severe than in some other countries: it has been estimated that perhaps no more than a tenth of the increase in actual earnings over the past 10 years mayhave been due to drift. Since the powers of the Commission to determine federalbasic wages (and, in practice, state basic wages) do not extend to any controlover profits, many firms or industries may find themselves able to bid up ratesin order to get scarce labour. There seem to be no sanctions against this, and people who have studied the problem have merely expressed the hope that employers&apos; organisations will come to acquire some of the discipline of unions and prevent their members from frustrating the objects of the Commission bypaying in excess of the centrally-agreed rates.The existence of wage-drift has set up some tensions because of the largenumbers of people on federal or state basic rates who do not benefit from drift.Increases in the Federal Basic Wage do not solve this problem as they seem generally to apply equally to those whose earnings are already above it. Consequentlythere have been some demands for the introduction of Wages Councils, on Britishlines, to look after the interests of those who are weak or badly organised.Nevertheless it seems clear that the activities of the Commission haveinfluenced the rate of increase in wages and may do so even more in future if theview of the Government or of some independent body about the size of increase the economy can stand continues to be taken explicitly into account bythe Commission in reaching its decisions. But in the long run this presumablydepends on the continued agreement by both sides of industry that this is areasonable way for the size of wage increases to be determined.SwedenSweden is like the Netherlands and unlike Australia, in that increases in wage rates are largely determined by central agreement between employers and unions.Both the L.O. (the equivalent of our Trades Union Congress, but with muchgreater control over member unions) and the S.A.F. (the Employers&apos; Confederation)have resisted the idea of arbitration on economic disputes, though they have accepted assistance from an extensive Government mediation service. TheGovernment have from time to time made pronouncements about what they considered an appropriate increase in money incomes, but their views have often been overridden in the course of the central bargaining.Over the past few years the scope of central bargaining has shifted; the L.O.and S.A.F. now make major bargains on a basic framework for wage increases,while the more detailed questions of changes in differentials, etc., are discussed byand between individual unions.   The central negotiations sometimes provide
explicit exceptions in the case of certain unions or employers&apos; groups, wher!increases above or below the average seem called for. In the course of the centralbargaining there are intensive discussions about the appropriate scale of increases on the basis of figures and views submitted both by the L.O. and the Government.But the Government have no direct power to affect the scale of wage increases, andhave often fallen back on exhortation. The L.O. has rejected the idea of any direct control of wages, or indeed of prices. But it has always been alive to the problem ofinflationary wage increases and has expressed the view that it is the job ofthe Government to prevent these, not by controlling wages, but by preventing an excessive pressure of demand from developing and so aggravating the problem of wage-drift which has often been a serious one in Sweden. The unions have alsoapproved of the idea of moving towards some system of job evaluation (along Dutchlines) as a contribution towards cutting down wage drift.As in the Netherlands, such wages policy as exists in Sweden derives from central agreement between the unions and the employers&apos; organisations, influenced by discussions with the Government about the implications of the current economicsituation. It does not derive from particular Government sanctions; only from,the more general threat of the use of fiscal or monetary weapons.November 1961.
