SECRETthis document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 2065th December, 1961CABINETBERLIN ECONOMIC COUNTER-MEASURESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsI attach, for the consideration of my colleagues, a paper jointly agreed by theChancellor of the Exchequer and myself, on the question of whether Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should commit themselves to make a contribution to a fund proposedby the North Atlantic Alliance to mitigate the effects of economic counter-measures.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I,4th December, 1961.ANNEXBERLIN ECONOMIC COUNTER-MEASURESMemorandum by OfficialsThe Working Group on economic counter-measures established by the NorthAtlantic Council have evolved a scheme to mitigate the effects of economic counter-measures against the Soviet bloc on the economies of those members of the Alliancewho would be most seriously hurt by loss of exports to the bloc. An importantand probably key feature of the scheme is a fund to provide financial assistanceto countries exporting to the Soviet bloc at least 10 per cent, of their total exports.2. The fund would be administered by a Steering Board. Full details ofthe proposed scheme are set out in the Appendix. In practice the candidatesfor this help would be Turkey, Greece and Iceland.3. The scheme has already been approved in principle by the WorkingGroup, except for the Canadians who have reserved their position, and has nowbeen submitted to the North Atlantic Council. The United Kingdomrepresentative in common with a number of other delegations has reserved hisposition on the question of a contribution to the fund by his Government. Heexplained that the question would require careful study by Ministers in view of:(a) The economic difficulties which, as the Council were well aware, theUnited Kingdom was at present facing.(b) The very real difficulties which the United Kingdom would herself beexperiencing if and when the scheme came into operation.It will however soon be necessary to inform the Council of the position of Her% Majesty&apos;s Government on this question.Cost4. It is possible only to set the probable limits of the cost of this scheme.The total value of exports of the three countries in question to the Soviet blocSECRET60074Copy No^33
2SECRETin 1960 was about $100 millions. Loss of this trade amounting to $50 to $60 millionsmight be eligible for compensation in the first year of the scheme. The UnitedKingdom share of such compensation would be between $5 to $6 millions and$10 to $12 millions according to the formula adopted for sharing the burden(Appendix, paragraph 2).Arguments for a United Kingdom Contribution5. In the view of the Foreign Office the main arguments in favour of HerMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s agreeing in principle to contribute to the proposedfund are:(a) From the start of North Atlantic discussion of economic counter-measures,we have argued in favour of mutual co-operation to mitigate their effectson individual members of the North Atlantic Alliance. It is true thatwe chiefly had in mind measures to mitigate our difficulties that mightarise from loss of imports from the Soviet bloc and loss of shippingcontracts. But it should follow that we should not refuse to helpmitigate the harm suffered by other members of the Alliance throughtheir loss of exports to the Soviet bloc-particularly when thosemembers happen to be the poorest countries in the Alliance.(b) There is already a strong feeling among the Americans, French andGermans that the United Kingdom is dragging its feet throughout thewhole range of Berlin Contingency Planning (over military, economicand other counter-measures). This concern is to a large extentunreasonable, and we are taking all possible steps to dispel it. But ifwe now decline to assist in a North Atlantic burden-sharing exercise tomitigate the effects of economic counter-measures, there is a danger thatthis feeling towards us will spread to the smaller members of the Alliance,whose interests will be directly affected by our attitude. These membersof the Alliance at present tend to share our views on questions relatingto counter-measures generally. But if they suspect that we are notprepared to face the consequences of counter-measures, we may losetheir sympathy, support and respect and the whole project of counter-measures might collapse. In international circumstances so grave as toproduce a situation in which such a fund was required, it would bepolitically impossible to plead our inability to make a contribution toour poorer allies equivalent to the cost of a Boeing 707. In a cause ofthis kind our allies would surely expect us to look for a minor economyelsewhere in our overseas expenditure, and since countries frequentlyreceive and give aid at one and the same time, to excuse ourselves onthe grounds that we were asking for aid for the local costs of our troopsin Germany would be unlikely to impress members of the Alliance,given the vast difference in scale.(c) If we agree to participate in the proposed scheme from the beginning, weshall be in a position to influence its operation, and in particular to ensurethat it is not protracted indefinitely to the undue benefit of the beneficiarymembers.(d) Finally,  and  most  important,  the  United  Kingdom  has  a heavyresponsibility, as one of the major Powers in the Alliance and as one ofthe three Powers responsible for Berlin and the German question, toshare the burden that may fall upon other members of the Alliance,less directly involved in the Berlin dispute, through their agreement tosupport the Alliance all the way through the crisis. (It is notable thatthe Americans originally proposed that the financial burden should beshared solely by the three Powers and Germany.) If-for the sake ofsaving no more than $5-$10 millions (or at the outside $10-$12 millions)a year-we decline to play our part in this scheme, we shall be regardedby the rest of the Alliance as abdicating the position of leadership whichwe have so long sustained.Arguments against a United Kingdom Contribution6. In the view of the Treasury our present economic position is such that wecannot accept any commitment which may involve new oversea expenditure.Indeed, we are seeking to reduce Government oversea expenditure by  100 millionsSECRET
SECRET3a year. Moreover, if the embargo were to be imposed our economy would be likelyto suffer more seriously than would the economies of other potential donor membersof the Alliance. The main consideration, however, is that we have already submittedto the Alliance a claim for assistance in meeting the present burden of maintainingmilitary forces in Europe, which independent experts have judged to be justified,and that the Alliance are now looking for ways to help us. If the certificate whichthe North Atlantic Council have given us means anything, it means that we shouldnot add at all to our oversea commitments, whether the additions are small or large.It can, therefore, be argued that the United Kingdom would not be in a positionto contribute to the compensation fund and that contributions to that fund shouldcome from those members of the Alliance who can afford them.7. Whilst the Treasury recognise that the need for the scheme might arise,the fact that agreement has now to be reached on it in principle could have twodisadvantages:(a) The very existence of the scheme might make it easier for the Americansto gain support for their ideas of bringing the timing of the totaleconomic embargo forward-to a stage before there is any questionof war being imminent-as a means of demonstrating the &quot; solidarity &quot;of the Alliance.(b) There is a distinct risk that if we were to agree now to provide financialassistance to Greece and Turkey under this scheme it would be moredifficult to resist pressures to participate in other schemes which mightbe advanced for providing aid through the Alliance to those countriesin circumstances not connected with a Berlin crisis. The Turks andGreeks have pressed their claims for assistance from their partnersin the Alliance tirelessly in the past and they would be encouragedto renew their claims. This would happen particularly if-as seemslikely-the Americans were to renew their pressure on North Atlanticcountries to reduce their dependence on trade with the Soviet bloc.8. From the economic point of view it would clearly be preferable if w$could defer a decision as to whether we should contribute to the scheme until suchtime as it had to be put into operation. We should then be in a better positionto judge our own economic position following the imposition of the countermeasures; we should also know what we should be getting from the Germansas a result of the &quot; certificate of need &quot; and we should perhaps be in a betterposition to assess the future burden of our oversea expenditure generally. If wewere now to insist on postponing our decision, however, some other members ofthe Alliance, who have already expressed reservation about the scheme, mightlikewise defer their decisions. The uncertainty thus created might prevent decisionsbeing reached on the implementation of the scheme. This, in turn, might impededecision on the common action by the Alliance to impose the counter measures.It is important, therefore, that we should declare our position to the North AtlanticAlliance as soon as possible.9. Accordingly, Ministers are asked to decide whether(a) to ask for exemption for the United Kingdom from making any contributionunder the scheme should it have to be put into operation; or(b) to agree now that, if the need should arise, the United Kingdom wouldcontribute to the scheme outlined.30th November, 1961.APPENDIXScheme to Assist Member Countries Hurt by Economic Counter-MeasuresAgainst the Soviet BlocA scheme has been evolved in the Alliance designed:(a) To redirect to the free world exports diverted from the Soviet bloc as aresult of economic counter-measures.(b) In so far as this redirection proves impossible to compensate those countriesmost seriously hurt.SECRET
4SECRETThe Compensation Fund2. The main feature of the scheme is the establishment of a fund to whichmember-countries would contribute according to a formula modelled on one of theburden-sharing formulae used by international organisations and possibly takingaccount of the effects of the counter-measures on the economies of the variouscountries in the Alliance. Agreement has not yet been reached on the formulawhich should be adopted; that for the North Atlantic Infrastructure Slices XII-XVhas been suggested. This formula was devised for entirely different purposes (viz.for sharing the costs of the construction of permanent military installations), butit has the advantage of making the United Kingdom contribution (10-5 per cent.)less than would be the share under any of the other possible ready-made formulae.If this formula were to be adopted the United Kingdom contribution in the firstyear should not exceed $5-$6 millions; under any other formula it might be nearlytwice as much.3. The figure of $5-$6 millions is based on the total value of exports of thethree countries to the Soviet bloc in 1960 amounting to about $100 millions; itwould appear that the total value in 1961 may be slightly lower but it is difficult toassess this now. The scheme is only intended to cover exports of &quot; significance forthe economy of those countries &quot; and it is not intended, on grounds of principle, toprovide compensation in respect of 100 per cent, of losses. In these circumstancesand allowing for some redirection of exports the total amount of compensation inthe first year should not exceed $50-$60 millions.Form of Assistance from the Fund4. Assistance would take two distinct forms:(a) Interest-free loans to cover temporary loss while exports were redirectedfrom the Soviet bloc to other countries.(b) Compensatory payments which could amount at the most to the totalnormal value of such exports for which new outlets were not found.Eligibility for Assistance5. Only those countries exporting at least 10 per cent, of their total exports tothe Soviet bloc would be eligible for help from the fund. This in practice would limitbenefits to Turkey, Greece and Iceland.Administration of the Scheme6. The scheme would be administered by a Steering Board on which allmembers would be represented. The decision of the Board would be reached by amajority vote, voting being weighted in a manner yet to be decided, probablyaccording to contributions in granting assistance under the Scheme. The Boardwould take into account both the particular losses suffered by the countries mostseriously hurt and any exceptional advantages enjoyed such as an increase in pricelevels which might partially offset these losses.Duration of the Scheme7. The scheme would come into operation as soon as counter-measuresamounting to an interruption of trade relations with the Soviet bloc were appliedand would continue until the trade of the beneficiaries regained a normal level. Itis intended that the operation of the scheme and the need for its continuance bereviewed on termination of the counter-measures or after six months, whicheverwas the sooner, and thereafter at six-monthly intervals.November 1961.SECRET
