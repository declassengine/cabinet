f CONFIDENTIAL (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 180 Copy No.     5 68th November, 1961CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRANTS BILL: APPLICATION TO THEIRISH republic memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIt is clear from Press and Parliamentary reaction to the publication of theCommonwealth Immigrants Bill that the position of the Irish Republic is goingto be one of the major points of controversy.2. The Cabinet on 10th October (C.C. (61) 55th Conclusions, Minute 3)approved legislation on the lines proposed in my paper C. (61) 153, which included the following paragraph:&quot;9. Irish Citizens. As drafted, the Bill applies to citizens of the irish republic, but the Commonwealth Migrants Committee are agreed that controlof entry from Ireland is not in fact practicable. Since in the last analysis theproposed control would operate on the principle of &quot; first come, first served &quot;,thus involving no national quotas, I see no alternative but to be frank aboutthe Irish if the question is raised, taking our stand upon the same considerations which led us in the context of nationality to treat Irish citizens as if theywere British subjects a useful precedent in the present connexion. It wouldalso be impracticable to have a comprehensive control of commonwealth citizens entering this country via the Irish Republic. Arrangements would bemade for ad hoc control where, for example, a large boatload of West Indianswas expected by this route: for the rest we would hope to obtain as we doover aliens the co-operation of the immigration authorities of the irish republic in operating a control similar to ours.&quot;3. The Bill, as introduced, includes a provision applying it to citizens of theIrish Republic, but I think that I ought to make a statement on Second Readingto the effect that, for practical reasons, it is not proposed at present to operate control on passenger traffic from the Republic. Such a control could not be appliedwithout a passport check at the customary ports of entry from the Republic. Thereare a large number of passengers, and any control would cause delay and inconvenience to our own citizens, who are accustomed to move freely betweenthe two countries. Further, without the co-operation of the Irish Republic, thecontrol of Commonwealth immigrants trying to enter the United Kingdom direct from the Republic would prove very difficult. Unless a control were established on traffic between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and an amendment to theBill enabling this to be done would be bitterly opposed we should have to try and control entry across the land border between the Republic and NorthernIreland. This could be done under the Bill, but even in war-time it proved verydifficult to control this land border effectively.4. Informal negotiations have been held with officials in Dublin, from whichit seems likely that the Government of the Irish Republic may be prepared toco-operate with us to prevent parties of Commonwealth citizens entering the UnitedKingdom by way of the Republic. In order to do this, it would be necessary forthe Government of the Irish Republic to amend their own legislation, and theycould hardly do so unless a clear statement were made of our own intentions in-operating the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill.59952
05. In these circumstances, while I recognise that it may assist our critics intheir contention that the Bill represents racial discrimination against coloured people, I feel that the only sensible course is to make a statement on SecondReading on the lines of the attached draft, making it clear that, while the powersof the Bill extend to the Republic of Ireland, it is, for practical reasons, not proposedto exercise them at the moment. I hope my colleagues will agree.DRAFT OF PROPOSED STATEMENT ON SECOND reading the House will wish me to say something about the application of this Bill-to the Irish Republic.Citizens of the Republic, although no longer British subjects, possess understatute all the privileges and obligations of British subjects. Since, therefore, theBill applies to all British subjects from the Commonwealth, we have thought it right to frame it so as to apply also to citizens of the Irish Republic, and this isthe effect of Clause 1 (4).But the Government have to consider the practical steps that would have tobe taken if the movement of passengers from the Republic to this country wereto be controlled. Many workers whose services are of value to this country,including large numbers of seasonal workers who are not immigrants in the truesense, come here from the Republic, and the scale of passenger movement betweenthe Republic and the United Kingdom would make any control a matter of greatpractical difficulty. The imposition of such a control would also cause delay and inconvenience to our citizens, who are accustomed to move freely, and in largenumbers, between the two countries, and who do not need to carry any passportsor identity documents with them.Moreover, if controls were imposed on the movement of passengers comingdirect from the Republic to Great Britain they would also have to be imposedeither along the land frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland, or atthe ports and airports at which people arrive in Great Britain from NorthernIreland. There are obvious objections to imposing such controls along the border,and their imposition at ports and airports in this country which would of coursemean an amendment of the Bill would cause great inconvenience to citizens ofthe United Kingdom, and would be most difficult to justify.In view of these practical difficulties, the Government hops to avoid anyexamination of passengers at the usual ports of entry from the Republic, and donot, therefore, propose at present to operate control between the two countries.No such difficulties attend the making of deportation orders against citizens of the Irish Republic who commit offences here and are recommended for deportation by the courts, and I should propose to give effect to such recommendations in proper cases.November 1961.R.
