I have approved these proposals.2. Under the general direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the chief secretary will deal with:(i) All supply and establishment questions and questions relating to otherExchequer expenditure (apart from service of the Debt); includingthe University Grants Committee, Arts Council, and other fields inwhich the Treasury itself is the accounting Department for government expenditure.(ii) Investment plans and other financial proposals in the nationalised industries.(iii) The long-term programming of public expenditure.(iv) Pay and related questions in the public services (Civil Service, armed forces,teachers, nurses, police, &amp;c).3. The primary purpose of the new appointment is to lighten the burdenshitherto falling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This purpose will not beachieved unless the Chief Secretary can exercise full authority in the fields of workassigned to him, as set out in the preceding paragraph. I must therefore ask mycolleagues to recognise that in those fields he has the same power of decision as theChancellor of the Exchequer would have if he were exercising this jurisdiction. it follows that, if a Minister is dissatisfied with a decision taken by the Chief Secretary,it will not be open to him to ask that the disputed matter should be referred to theChancellor of the Exchequer.H.
