THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1961Copy No.    5 9C. (61) 17430th October, 1961CABINETADMINISTRATIVE AND MINOR POLICY SAVINGS INGOVERNMENT expenditure note by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general with the authority of the Cabinet (CC. (61) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4) theChancellor of the Exchequer gave an undertaking in the House of Commons on25th July that he would do his utmost to limit the increase in the Estimates for1962-63 over 1961-62 to 2\ per cent, in real terms. He had informed the Cabinetthat fulfilment of this undertaking was likely to require savings in government expenditure of at least  100 millions.2. It is not yet possible to be certain of the definite figure, but decisions on major policy will undoubtedly be necessary, in addition to every practicable savingby way of administrative and minor policy changes.3. The annexed report by officials deals with the latter only. It shows howsavings in that category, together with economies in civil defence and in overseasadministrative expenditure, can yield about  14f millions. This is a valuable contribution for which the Chancellor and I would like to thank all our colleagues.4. I invite the Cabinet to approve the report, and to ask Ministers to ensurethat the follow-up work envisaged in the report is carried out effectively, and thatin all respects their 1962-63 Estimates are very tightly drawn.5. Consideration is being given to the best ways of achieving the further economies in the 1962-63 Estimates that will be required to fulfil the Governmentspledge.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,27th October, 1961.59879b
ANNEXADMINISTRATIVE AND MINOR POLICY savings in GOVERNMENT EXPENDITUREReport by the Public Expenditure Survey CommitteeIn his statement in Parliament on 25th July the Chancellor of the exchequer said, referring to Government Supply expenditure: &quot; There will be a stringentre-examination to see what savings can be made in administration and in other respects.&quot; This is the first step towards implementing the intention to contain the 1962-63 Estimates within an increase of 2J per cent, in real terms over the1961-62 Estimates, which was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on25th July and to which the Prime Minister referred in his minute on public expenditure sent to all Ministers in charge of Departments.2. The examination of the main spending Departments has been undertakenthrough the Public Expenditure Survey Committee. Departments not represented on this Committee were circularised by the Treasury and have carried out asimilar examination of their expenditure. The Service Departments have not been included in the exercise, since the Defence Budget for 1962-63 has already been fixed, but they have, nevertheless, been specifically asked to cut by 10 per cent,their oversea administrative expenditure, particularly on the employment of locallyengaged staff. The Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, ColonialOffice and Department of Technical Co-operation have also not been covered,since it was considered that they should first complete the special review of theiradministrative and information expenditure overseas; it would be appropriate that these Departments should now proceed to examine the possibility of savings in their expenditure at home.Method of the Review3. It was the general wish of the Departments represented on the Committeethat the Treasury should indicate the order of magnitude of the savings whichthey should seek. In order to arrive at the &quot; targets &quot; the Treasury first subtractedfrom Departments&apos; gross Estimates those expenditures already decided or underreview elsewhere, expenditure clearly falling outside the field of &quot; administration and minor policy&quot;, and certain expenditures reserved for special consideration;and made adjustments to allow for the possibility of increasing receipts. Thefield remaining to be covered by this exercise was thus only 11 per cent, of thetotal civil supply expenditure forecast for 1962-63, spread among the home civil departments. For example, only  4% millions of Ministry of Health expenditure was within the review, expenditure on the National Health Service and on welfarefoods being excluded. Similarly, major grants by the Ministry of Housing tolocal authorities were excluded from the review. The &quot; targets &quot; were in most cases put at about 5 per cent., though some account was taken of the different circumstances of Departments. The total for the Departments represented on thePublic Expenditure Survey Committee (including the Research Councils) came to 141 millions.4. Departments have carried out a full and careful review of the possibilitiesof saving in the field of expenditure for which they are responsible. The reviewhas covered not only possible savings in 1962-63 but also cases in which the gainmay not appear until later years, or until after a change of policy which may atsome future date become possible; for example, if there were a general reductionin United Kingdom tariffs, it might then be possible to discontinue the presentsystem, which is expensive in staff, of remitting duty on individual consignments of certain classes of imports.5. Some Departments have been able to offer savings up to their &quot; target &quot;(and in some cases even more); others have been able to do much less, or even tofind no savings at all. This difference in performance was to be expected in viewof the rough and ready methods necessarily adopted in fixing the &quot; targets &quot; andthe different circumstances of different Departments and varying scope for minorSECRET59879 B 2
policy as well as administrative savings; but the Committee have devoted special attention to the Departments which were unable to offer savings substantiallyon the scale indicated by their targets, and have received from each of these departments a detailed account of the work carried out for this exercise and itsresults. The Committee are satisfied that a substantial effort has been made bythe Departments concerned.Savings Secured6. The savings in 1962-63 offered by the Departments represented on theCommittee total  10-6 millions. Details are given in the Appendix. The  10-million savings include  1-27 millions resulting from the change in the definition of apprentices for purposes of Family Allowances, which Ministers have recently approved.7. In addition, Departments not represented on the Committee have so farnotified savings totalling  1-2 millions and there should be further contributions from these sources, though they are not likely to be large. Meanwhile the resultshave been reported to the Committee of the separate reviews which have beenmade of administrative and information expenditure overseas and of civil defence.A reduction of just under  1 million in the civil defence programmes has beendecided. The savings so far achieved in the review of overseas administrativeexpenditure total about  2-4 millions. Not all of these savings will be reflected in reductions in total expenditure, because some of the overseas economies will beeffected by bringing staff home to the United Kingdom. There is, moreover, asmall overlap between the &quot; administrative and minor policy&quot; review and the&quot; overseas administrative expenditure&quot; review. It is likely, however, thatconsequent on the overseas review, there will be a net saving in total expenditureof about  2 millions.8. The total of net savings in 1962-63 resulting from the reviews of administrative and minor policy, of civil defence and of overseas administrativeexpenditure is therefore about  14J millions, to which any further savings fromthe review of overseas Departments&apos; expenditure at home or from Departmentsnot represented on the Public Expenditure Survey Committee will be additional.General Points9. The work of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee on administrative and minor policy savings has brought out certain general points. First,administrative savings can only be made either by carrying out existing work with fewer staff or by eliminating blocks of work. The scope for the former hasbeen thoroughly examined. It must always be under continuous review by departments and by the Treasury, with the aid, where appropriate, of O. and M.service. But the Committee consider that no further substantial savings of this type can be secured by further special ad hoc reviews in the near future. the elimination of blocks of work involves changes of policy. Such changes as canbe made immediately have been included in the present proposals.10. Second, it was recognised that Departments should continue to be alertto possible savings in the future as a result of future changes of policy reflectingaltered circumstances.11. Third, Departments agree that when new proposals are put forwardwhich have staffing implications, the staff cost should be taken into account whenMinisters take their decisions.12. Fourth, in considering the scope for savings in Government expenditure,it is essential to take a wide view and to bear in mind not only the effects onDepartments&apos; cash Estimates, but also the effect on public expenditure and revenueas a whole. For example, there is no advantage in reducing staff in RevenueDepartments if the benefit will be more than off-set by consequent losses of revenue;or in making cash &quot; savings &quot; in 1962-63 which make greater expenditure in1963-64. Some types of postponement of expenditure fall into the latter category,but there are also cases in which postponing expenditure by delaying the start of a whole project or programme secures a genuine saving in the period of postponement.
13. A useful contribution can often be secured by increasing the charges which Departments make for certain services. In the present exercise departments were asked particularly to examine this possibility, and a review was also madein the Treasury, mainly to see whether there is a case for comprehensive legislation in this field. The review showed that only in a few cases, in which the matterwill best be pursued separately by the Department concerned, are fees and chargessubject to statutory limitation; for the most part they can be raised by administrative action, and some Departments have included measures of this naturein their proposed savings. It is clearly important that Departments should keep their charges continuously under review, bearing in mind that where they areselling goods or services at charges which are intended to cover the full cost, thecharges must include a share of administrative and other overheads and an allowance for appropriate commercial return on any capital involved, and will need to be revised whenever necessary to keep pace with increases in any of the elements of the full cost.Recommendations14.   It is recommended that:(i) the Departments concerned should take account of the savings listed inthe Appendix in framing their Estimates for 1962-63;(ii) the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, Colonial Office and department of Technical Co-operation should carry out in respect oftheir expenditure at home a review similar to that done by otherDepartments;(iii) all Departments should keep under continuous review the scope forfurther savings of the type discussed in this report, and should put intoeffect such further economies as may become possible in future as aresult of changing circumstances.October 1961.
appendix summary OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND MINOR POLICY SAVINGSMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodPostponement of the swine fever eradication campaign, saving  1 million.Various additional savings and increases in fees bring the total to about  1,350,000.Atomic Energy AuthoritySavings of  73,000 on staff,  164,000 on travel and subsistence and about 264,000 on miscellaneous specific items.  Total  501,000.Ministry of Aviation (Civil)Various savings, including reduction of overseas expenditure on groundservices ( 192,000).  Total of savings  342,000.Customs and ExciseSavings of  175,000 from a general re-scheming of the Outdoor Serviceaccelerated by the administrative and minor policy exercise. Also other smallersavings.  Total  200,000.Ministry of EducationVarious savings, including reductions in grants for new premises andequipment for school meals ( 414,000), for direct grant grammar schools ( 118,000),for Youth Service ( 54,000), for Further Education ( 35,000), for the College ofAeronautics ( 65,000) and the Commonwealth Institute ( 30,000); and suspension of improvement of services on physical training and recreation ( 21,000). Totalsavings:  758,000.Ministry of HealthVarious savings on staff and travelling expenses, including changes in theNational Health Service audit system ( 76,000), and a reduction of staff of the mental Health Review Tribunals ( 11,000). Saving on Post Office charges inconnexion with the sale of welfare foods against postage stamps ( 66,500). Totalsavings  210,900.Home Office and Prison CommissionDespite a careful review, only various small administrative savings and increases in fees can be proposed, yielding a net saving of  225,000. In addition,provision is made for an increased surplus of  115,000 from the Carlisle statemanagement district. The Home Office report that no further savings can besecured consistently with present major policy and the trend of demand for services for which the Home Office are responsible.Ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentSavings of  373,100, mainly on grants to local authorities. Of this amount 105,000 depends on less subsidisation of industrial transfers under the local employment Act, 1960, so that Board of Trade certificates in respect of ancillary services are issued less freely.Inland RevenueNil. The only practicable means of making economies would be by staffreductions. But there is already a staff shortage in certain branches, and a thorough examination has shown that any reduction of numbers would be more than offset by the resultant loss of revenue. There may be some possible savings in thefuture, e.g., from further mechanisation or as a result of a recent O. and M. study of P.A.Y.E. procedures; but these cannot be quantified at this stage and will not affect the 1962-63 Estimates.
Ministry of LabourSavings of  553,500 on salaries from such measures as the closing of twoTraining Centres ( 58,000), abolition of the Technical and Scientific Register( 86,000), and reduction of staff. Also various other savings. Total (including some increased receipts):  782,000.National Assistance BoardIntensification of efforts against those applicants for National Assistance who,though not in fact unemployable, appear content to remain unemployed. Savingsestimated at  500,000.Ministry of Pensions and National InsuranceSavings of  1,275,000 by amendment of the relevant definition of apprenticesfor Family Allowance purposes; this has recently been approved by Ministers.Additional savings of  349,000 (gross) by various measures, including a reductionin the routine medical examinations of war pensioners, reduction of local officeaudit and certain cuts in estimated future staff requirements. There is, however,a consequential reduction of  190,000 in recoveries from the National insurance fund, so that the total net savings to the Exchequer are  1,409,000.Ministry of PowerVarious reductions, mainly in establishment expenditure and increases in fees and charges, including increased rental charges for oil storage. Total savings: 250,000.Research CouncilsSavings of  706,000 found by the Medical Research Council ( 231,000), theAgricultural Research Council ( 400,000), and the Nature Conservancy ( 75,000);certain research projects will be slowed down.No account has been taken at this stage of minor policy savings on theDepartment of Scientific and Industrial Research (D.S.I.R.) Vote. The whole ofD.S.I.R.&apos;s expenditure is at present under consideration under the regular forwardlook arrangements.Scottish Departments (except agriculture)Savings of  269,000 mainly by reducing various educational grants ( 109,000)and by a review of rents being undertaken by the Scottish Special housing association ( 150,000).Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for ScotlandVarious savings, e.g., on management and farming expenses ( 37,000) and increased fees and charges, some of which will, however, require legislation. Total 188,000, plus an estimated  140,000 from sales of land.Board of TradeSavings of  15,000 on staff reductions in the Statistics Division and the hire purchase Inspectorate. The Board of Trade report their inability to find further savings because of the comparative narrowness of the field effectively available and the considerable growth of activity in the economic field.Ministry of TransportVarious reductions in expenditure, e.g., on trunk road surveys and lighting( 90,000), research ( 50,000) and increases in fees ( 295,000). Total  545,000.Treasury and MiscellaneousVarious small savings, including  50,000 in the payment to the Bank ofEngland for exchange control services and  9,000 in the provision for the ScottishSavings Committee.  Total about  70,000.  The possibility of a further reduction
of  25,000 in expenditure on residential hostels is under consideration. The totalof the Treasury Votes in the 1962-63 Estimates should be below the 1961-62level, and to enforce further reduction would be damaging to the effectiveness ofeconomic policy, to the control of public expenditure and to the services whichthe Treasury and its subordinate Departments provide for Departments generally.Ministry of WorksSavings from postponement of new works expenditure ( 870,000),postponement of maintenance expenditure ( 330,000), spreading out of programmes for refurnishing the Civil Service ( 250,000) and reduction of staff ( 300,000).Total  1,750,000.Departments not represented on the Public Expenditure Survey CommitteeForestry CommissionSavings by reducing the industrial labour force (by leaving vacancies unfilled)( 160,000), by reducing expenditure on buildings and machinery ( 95,000), by increasing the receipts from sales of home grown timber ( 100,000), and by varioussmaller savings.  Total  500,000.Lord Chancellors OfficeIncreased Supreme Court and County Court Fees are estimated to yield anadditional  384,000.  This depends on acceptance of the proposals by the Judges.Other DepartmentsSeveral smaller Departments have made savings totalling  279,000.October 1961.
