C. (61) 2108th December, 1961COPY NO. iOCABINETEDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURJMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-general in my paper  C. (6l) 199, I refer to the problem of educationalexpenditure as &quot;perhaps the most crucial unresolved question in thelong-term public expenditure plan&quot;.    In this paper, I am setting it outin a way which I hope the Minister of Education will regard as fair, andam proposing what I trust will be an acceptable procedure for dealingwith it.    For simplicity, I deal here with England and &quot;Wales alone.Scotland must be considered separately, in the light of the Cabinet1 views on general principles.2.      There are two related problems which must be considered atthe same time:-(i) The rate of increase of current education expenditure,which is one of the biggest single elements in public expenditure as a whole.(ii)    The investment expenditure for 1963-64, 1964-65 and1965-66, which it is now necessary to determineurgently.These cannot be separated, because the investment expenditure,representing the expansion of the nation&apos;s educational facilities,necessarily leads to increases in current expenditure as the new build-ings are brought into use.     It is difficult to establish an exactarithmetical link between the two sets of expenditures at specificdates;   some forms of investment, e. g. , teacher training colleges and(to a somewhat less extent) technical colleges, have a much greaterimpact upon continuing current expenditure than others, e. g. , the replacement of old schools.    But we can perhaps say that an investment of  1, 000 will on the average involve continuing current expenditureof the order of  200 a year.    As paragraph 108 of the Report on public Expenditure and Resources circulated with C.(6l) 88 says,&quot;Broadly speaking, the increases (in current expenditure) are mainlyattributable to the expanding numbers of teachers(stimulated of courseby the teacher training expansion)and to the cost of maintaining and operating and financing the buildings which are being provided by the growing investment programme&quot;.
3.      The containment of the increase of public expenditure as a wholeappears to me to require a slower increase of current expenditure and as lower increase of public service investment over the whole field than is envisaged in the present policies of Departments generally.4.      The difficulty about educational expenditure is its great size andmomentum.     The need for an expansive educational policy is common ground among all of us.     There is no need for anyone to persuade either the Chancellor of the Exchequer or myself of the importance of this,both from a social and from an economic point of view.5.      The problem for the Cabinet is that whenever a service becomesas big as education - about 10 per cent of all public expenditure, and nearly 4? per cent of the whole gross national product - a decision to let it grow substantially faster than the national product inevitablymeans either that other services must grow much more slowly than thenational product, or that public expenditure must grow faster than theresources available, with the familiar consequences.6,      There can be no question of cutting education.    Of course theservice should and must expand and develop, and this must involveincreasing expenditure.    The point at issue is what shall be the rateof increase of current expenditure in the next four years, and whether there should be any further increase at all in the present high level of investment expenditure.Growth of current expenditure.      The basic figures are in Annex A.    Briefly, the local authorities&apos;current expenditure is estimated to rise from  694 millions in 1961-62 to 830 millions in 1965-66, an increase of  136 millions, i. e. , by19. 6 per cent in four years, or 4. 6 per cent per year.    This is at constant pay and prices, and excludes the current Burnham settlementcosting around  50 millions a year.    Of the  136 millions increase, 47 millions is for primary and secondary schools, an increase ofabout 9 per cent per pupil;    46 millions to further education, teacher training, and awards to students, an increase of about 45 per cent; 32 millions to additional loan charges, following the investmentexpenditures;  and the remaining  11 millions miscellaneous.8.      The Report circulated with C. (6l) 88 suggested that the rate of increase should be kept to 3 per cent per year.     This would mean thatcurrent expenditure on education, instead of rising by  136 millionsbetween 1961-62 and 1965-66, would rise by about  85 millions.    Thiswas an important part of a series of recommendations coveringdefence, agriculture, assistance to private and nationalised industry,public investment of all kinds, roads, health, and pensions, as well aseducation.-2-
Investment expenditure. The investment expenditure proposed by the Minister ofEducation is as follows (see Annex B):-Investment Expenditure  millions109. 6    ) Agerage 117.2116.7    ) (as settled in125.4    )  July).       i134.6    )136.4    )  Average 136.7139.2    )The proposal for a further large expansion in investment follows a rapid increase in recent years.    The approvals by the Ministry of education in I960, for example, at  101 millions, compare with  80 millions ayear average in 195 7-59 and  75 millions average in 1954-56.10. We cannot in my judgment accept this further expansionproposed.    There are two reasons.    First, we cannot afford the investment itself.     The aggregate of public service investmentproposed by Departments, as I indicated to the Economic PolicyCommittee, would be some 15-20 per cent above the present level inthe coming period, and this is too much.    H we decided to maintain for educational investment in 1963-64/-65/-66 the average of the presentvery high three years, we should be spending nearly  60 millions lessin the three years than is proposed.     Without containment like this,and of course corresponding action in other programmes, I cannot get total investment expenditure within reasonable compass.Secondly, we cannot afford the increased current expenditure whichwillflow from the increased investment.    If the formula in paragraph 2is about right, the postponement of  60 millions of investment would yield a saving in current expenditure of some  12 millions a year.This would be a major contribution towards the  50 millions a yearinvolved in moving from the proposed rate of increase of 4. 6 per cent per year to the rate of 3 per cent increase per year which I believeis as much as we can afford.11. In the discussions in July, the Chancellor of the exchequer was prepared to accept a level of  120. 5 millions investment expenditure for each of the three years 1963-64/-65/-66.     Thiswould be above the agreed average for the present three-year period.It would be  50 millions below what the Minister of Education wants to see spent on investment in the three years.Method of Procedure12. Given all the claims upon us, I am sure that it is out ofthe question to embark now upon a new wave of expansion of educational investment expenditure.     This situation must clearly be handled with great thought and skill.     The right way, I suggest,1960-611961-621962-631963-641964-651965-66
is to proceed with an orderly planned reconstruction of the programmes for as many years ahead as are administratively desirable.    Thiswould be designed to lead to investment expenditure in the three years1963-64/-65/-66 at an average of either the current three-year averageof  117. 2 millions a year, or the higher figure of  120.5 millions ayear proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in July, whichever theCabinet think is more appropriate.    In this re-planning it might perhaps be best to adjust the programmes of building starts for1961-62 and 1962-63 which have been notified to the local authorities.If this adjustment resulted in a reduced expenditure estimate for1962-63, the differance could be added on to 1963-64/-65/-66.13. The re-planning wotild naturally be done in a way *hat wouldinvolve the least possible shortfall on the three aims which theGovernment have formulated in recent years, and towards which suchstriking progress has been made:-(a)   The aim to get work costing  300 millions started in thefive-year period 1960-61 to 1964-65 in the building programme for primary and secondary schools (&quot;white paper of December, 1958 - Cmnd. 604).05)   j^further education.    Following the successful completionof the five-year series of projects announced in the white paper of 1956 (Cmd. 9703) to provide  70 millions ofbuilding work to be started in 1956-67 to 1960-61, theMinister&apos;s announcement that programmes (i. e. , starts)would continue for 1961-62, 1962-63 and 1963-64 atbroadly the same rate of investment ( 15 millions a year)as in the previous five years.(c)    Teacher training.     The completion of the 24, 000 extraplaces by September, 1966.14. I think that it should be possible so to carry out the re-planning that the shortfalls would be marginal, either in a slightlengthening of the periods or in the amount of money authorised forspending, or both.    I hope also that it will be carried out in such away as will have the least expansionary effect upon current expenditure.If an acceptable programme can be devised on these lines, I would beprepared to agree to firm programmes of starts for 1962-63, 1963-64 and1964-65, subject to re-consideration only in the event of changesin costs or major changes in the economy, and subject to the usualmarginal flexibility up and down in relation to short-term movements in the economy.    By this we would give the local authorities themaximum certainty and ability to plan ahead and get the best possiblevalue for money.15. We should then look again at the modified rate of growth of current expenditure, in the light of our decisions for the other programmes, to see what, if any, other action will be required to contain it.
16. But I must make it absolutely clear that it will be fatal forus to try to carry out a larger educational investment programme thanthat indicated in paragraph IE, unless the rest of my colleagues areprepared to make not only the adjustments in their own programmes which are required to bring the aggregate of all our expenditure into line with prospective resources, but also further downward adjust-ments beyond that, in order to accommodate a further acceleration of education.    If we ignore this, we are in for further crises.17. I hope therefore that the Cabinet will accept the educationinvestment programme indicated in paragraph 12 as a reasonableway to deal with this problem.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.

This comes from an increaseof 8. 3 per cent in the junior and a fall of 7. 3 per cent in the seniorschools.    During this period, the numbers are at a temporary peak.In the second half of the 1960&apos;s the total will be rising again at a rateof about lj per cent per year.    The number of teachers is estimated to increase from 290, 000 to 311, 000, i. e. , by 21, 000 or 7. 5 per cent.The pupil/teacher ratio will improve from 24. 0 to 22. 8.
