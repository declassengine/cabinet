copy no.     5 8CABINETTRANSFER OF COLLEGES OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY   &apos;TO DIRECT grant memorandum by the Minister of education on 8th May last my colleagues in the Committee on Education Policy agreed with my proposal that as soon as it could be arranged the Colleges of advanced technology (CATs.) which are at present maintained by local authorities shouldbe transferred to direct grant status, with independent governing bodies. I consider,for reasons set out below, that it is essential for this transfer to be achieved nextyear. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, whose views are incorporated in this paper, does not dissent from the desirability of the transfer, but considers that itshould operate from April 1963.Present Position2. The CATs. have developed very promisingly since their designation fiveyears ago. They have about 9,000 full-time students taking courses in science and technology at university level, and on present plans this number is to increase to15,000 by the mid-1960s and later to a provisional target of 21,000. They are a major factor in the Governments policy for increasing the output of scientists andtechnologists. But this development is now being hampered by the local governmentframework within which they have to work. In particular, they need to attractmore staff of the right calibre-at present nearly 15 per cent, of their teaching postsare vacant. These vacancies will continue unless conditions of service arecomparable with those at the universities, and include a voice in the governmentof the colleges, and salaries related to university salaries for posts of similarresponsibility. To achieve these objects the CATs. have to be divorced from localgovernment control.3. We agreed with Lord Robbins, Chairman of the Committee on higher education, that these reforms were urgent and must not be held up.4. I made a statement in Parliament on 22nd June, and at the same time sent a memorandum containing my proposals for transfer to the local educationauthorities concerned, and to the Associations of Local Authorities, the Committeeof Principals of C.A.Ts. and the teachers&apos; associations. The local authorities(including the London County Council) have all agreed to co-operate fully in implementing the change by April 1962. This was not an easy decision for them,since it touches upon local pride and wider issues of local government responsibility;but they took it because they were convinced that the CATs. had now reached apoint in their development when a new status was urgent. (The London CountyCouncil took a rather different line from the others because their three collegesalready have an independent status, but like the others they have promised full co-operation.) 3Consequences of Deferment of Transfer5. When the Committee on Education Policy considered this matter in Maylast it was estimated that the net cost to public funds of the CATs. was  % millionsincluding capital, rising to about  1\ millions&apos;in the mid-1960s. The cost of thesecolleges has now been found to have been rising more sharply than was at firstestimated and, as the Annex shows, the estimated cost to public funds in 1962-63is likely to be  %\ millions.C.

6. Expenditure on the colleges at present attracts general grant and it wasagreed that if transfer took place before April 1963, when the present grant periodexpires, a due proportion of the grant for 1962-63 would be recovered, and that ifthis proved impossible the change should be deferred until.April 1963.7. It has in fact been agreed with the representatives of the associations oflocal authorities that this recovery should be made by adjusting the general grant in 1962. Thus if the change is made in April 1962, the net additional charge to theExchequer in. 1962-63 would on present estimates be  5 millions,  8^ millions lessa recovery of i3\ millions. (I have now approved the proposals for higher salariessubmitted by the Burnham Technical Committee which includes the CATs. Thiswill add about  450,000 to the salaries bill of which, were the transfer not to takeplace, about  250,000 would be met by the Exchequer through general grant. Theadditional cost transferred from local to central funds would therefore be about 200,000.) On the estimates originally submitted to the Committee on EducationPolicy, it would have been  3 millions,  4J millions less a recovery of millions.The Chief Secretary is concerned because the incurring of this cost of  5 millionscuts across the Chancellors undertaking, given publicly and as part of the case thatwas put to the International Monetary Fund, to do his utmost to keep the increaseof Government supply expenditure for 1962-63 at a level of not more than 2\ percent, in real terms above that of the budget estimates for 1961-62.8. The actual cost to public funds of the CATs. would be much the samewhether the CATs. are transferred or not. Total expenditure on them will increaseslightly on transfer assuming that salaries of senior staff are improved and that thenumber of vacancies drops in consequence. This marginal increase could be avoided in 1962-63 by deferring the transfer. On the other hand, as the Annexexplains, another effect of deferring the change would be slightly to increaseExchequer expenditure on loan charges in future years. But I am advised and I fully concur that deferment would have the most serious consequences on the futured development of the CATs. and on public opinion especially in the light of thestatement in The Queen&apos;s Speech that special consideration will be given to theneeds of scientific and technical education. The reasons for this are as follows:(i) The effect on the local education authorities would be deplorable.  So far,the negotiations with them have proceeded smoothly. The authoritiesare justly proud of their colleges, but are disposed to resign their responsibilities in the national interest, and to act generously, inparticular by handing over very valuable sites, buildings and equipment for a consideration a good deal less, in many cases, than the true value.It will be impossible to persuade them of the merits of a postponementwhich makes a marginal saving in public funds only be leaving the senior staffs underpaid and the colleges understaffed. The opportunityof a smooth transfer to direct grant may not recur. The authorities will probably not be willing to tackle the matter again until after theRobbins Committee has reported, and when they do they may wellstrike a harder bargain. Legislation might be required to achieve theresult which we can now gain by agreement.(ii) The postponement would be widely interpreted as a sign that theGovernment were more interested in making the rates bear anotheryear&apos;s share of the expenditure than in carrying out a reform in the field of science and technology which everyone knows is urgent.(iii) The CATs. would be unable to make good present deficiencies in staffing,and would certainly lose many of their best staff to universities or industry.Conclusion ,9. I have set out above the serious disadvantages of postponement. If theoffset were to be a substantial saving in public expenditure as a whole, the economicargument would at least be clear. But this is not the issue. What we gain is ashort-term advantage to the Exchequer at the expense of local authorities and ofthe colleges and their staffs. I ask my colleagues for authority to proceed with thearrangements already agreed with the local education authorities for transferring the colleges to direct grant by April next.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,24th November, 1961.

Cardiff Local Education AuthorityLoughborough     College     ofTechnologyA tenth college is shortly to be designated, the Brunei College of Technology, Acton,at present maintained by the Middlesex Local Education Authority.2. The total call on public funds in .1962-63 by these nine maintained collegesis estimated to be about  8-J millions, as follows:  millionsRecurrent expenditure, including salaries, upkeep of premises,etc. and loan charges on buildings and equipment already provided ...      ...      ...............       6\Capital expenditure on new sites, buildings and equipment likelyto be provided in 1962-63    ...............        23. If the colleges were to continue to be maintained in 1962-63 by localeducation authorities, the recurrent expenditure would be met by the local educationauthorities out of revenue. The Exchequer would bear about  3 - 6 millions of thecost through the general grant (assessed up to the end of 1962-63); the other  2-9millions would fall on the rates. The capital expenditure would be met by meansof loans raised by the local education authorities, and the resulting loan charges would be added to the total of the recurrent expenditure in future years.4. If the Colleges of Advanced Technology are transferred to direct grant inApril 1962, the whole of the expenditure, recurrent and capital, will be met by grant from the Ministry of Education. But the Exchequer will recover  3-6 millionsby means of an adjustment to the general grant for 1962-63, so the net increasedcharge on the Exchequer will be about  5 millions.5. If the transfer is deferred until April 1963, the Exchequer wili save this 5 millions in 1962-63, but in 1963-64 and subsequent years the charge on theExchequer will be higher than it would have been if the transfer had taken placein April 1962, owing to the additional loan charges incurred in 1962-63.
