Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 199 Copy No.    6 329th November, 1961CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: THE POINTS FOR DECISIONMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to make myself responsible,under him, for the control of public expenditure. I am circulating this paper tothe Cabinet, after discussion with him, to see how far we are all agreed; for itseems to me essential that we should all understand and share the same general objectives, if we are to reach the right decisions in particular instances.Long-term Public Expenditure Plan2. First comes the basic need to keep the growth of public expenditure fromgetting out of step with the growth of national resources. There is no doubt fromexperience indeed it is common sense that if public expenditure is allowed to grow faster than the gross national product (G.N.P.), the burden of taxation willhave to rise. Likewise, for there to be any prospect of reducing and sustaining areduction in the burden of taxation, the ratio of public expenditure to G.N.P.over the years must fall.3. In the early years of our Administration, the ratio did fall, and that was what enabled us to reduce the tax burden. But in the last four years it has been pressing upward, and the report on Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62to 1965-66, circulated by the Chancellor at the end of June under cover ofC. (61) 88, indicated only too plainly that it will continue to rise if all our present policies are maintained.4. This is not simply a question of taxation, important as taxation is. It isa question of the health and growth of the United Kingdom economy as a whole,and of the future prosperity of all our people. If the public services take too large a share of the manpower and capital available at any given time, too smalla share will be left for private consumption, private investment and exports. here is a real cause of our recurrent crises and our indifferent economic performance.I feel as strongly as anybody that wise development of the public services is needed for economic growth; it is the pace of development that is crucial.5. The task is to make sure that public expenditure in the aggregate doesnot grow faster than resources (i.e., than G.N.P.). To achieve this we have to plan in advance, for most of the big decisions on public expenditure, whether in defenceor in social services or in investment, are decisions which govern the rate of spending for many years ahead.6. We need to concentrate first on getting agreed long-term policies for defence, oversea aid, agriculture, health, housing, pensions and so on: programmes which are framed realistically so that the expenditures resulting from them will inthe aggregate be in reasonable relationship with our prospective economic andfinancial resources, and which therefore can be carried out without repeatedcrises. I want these policies also to be of a character that will contribute to, notdamage, the nation&apos;s economic growth and competitiveness.

remove the frustration of the inevitable &quot; go-stop-go-stop&quot; which results fromfailure to carry this through; the benefits that will result from carrying it througheffectively are immeasurable. We made a start in July, with the new policy forassistance to industry and the long-term planning decisions on roads and on thedevelopment of the National Health Service.7. The preparation of a five-year expenditure plan was announced by theChancellor in his Budget speech last April:&quot; I have recently set in hand a study of the whole problem of public expenditure in relation to the prospective future growth of our resources fora period of five years ahead. . . . The object of carrying out the study whichI have just mentioned is to see how we can best keep public expenditure infuture years in proper relationship to the growth of our national product.&quot;Again in The Queen&apos;s Speech in October it was stated that the Government would seek to keep public expenditure within limits justified by the national resources.8. In next April&apos;s Budget speech and in the subsequent debate it will benecessary to be able to show that we have completed this work and have successfullybrought our policies into line with out prospective resources. The chancellor and I must ask our colleagues&apos; wholehearted support for the necessary action to achieve these objects.Public Investment 1963-64 to 1965-669. We need to decide this quickly, for the decisions which determine theexpenditure on investment projects in 1963-64 and subsequent years are already being made. This is the kernel of the long-term expenditure plan, for three reasons :(i) The size and nature of public investment has a great bearing upon thedevelopment of the national economy generally.(ii) The capital expenditure of the public services is itself a large consumer ofeconomic resources.(iii) The investment in the public services is the heart of their expansion anddevelopment, and is a motive force in expanding their current expenditure.10. We had a first discussion of 1963-64 public investment at the economic policy Committee on 9th November and I am carrying on discussions with theMinisters concerned. Overall we shall inevitably need to go forward more slowlythan Departments had been envisaging. But we must keep a sense of proportion.The Departments are proposing investment in the public services which, in theaggregate, will involve capital expenditure in 1963-64 and the two following yearsabout 15 or 20 per cent, above the present level. I judge that we could probablyfit in aggregate investment expenditure for the three years of (say) 10 per cent,above the present level.  All this is not a cut; it is a big expansion.11. The decisions on investment are of course an integral part of our long-termpublic expenditure plan, and one cannot separate them.Undertaking on 1962-63 Estimates12. We shall also need to take steps quickly toward carrying out theundertaking which the Chancellor with the authority of the Cabinet gave in his statement of 25th July, that &quot; I intend to do my utmost to keep this increase[of Government Supply expenditure in 1962-63] to a level of not more than2\ per cent, in real terms, which should be within our expanding capacity tocarry; that is to say, about  125 millions above the Estimates for 1961-62 &quot;.13. As I pointed out in C. (61) 174, we cannot be sure exactly what this will involve until the Estimates are all in. Nothing however has occurred to modify the opinion which the Chancellor expressed in July in C. (61) 107 that his promisewould &quot; require further savings (at early 1961 pay and prices), . . . over and above what (had) already been agreed, of at least a further  100 millions &quot;. We have since agreed upon administrative and minor policy savings of nearly  15 millions.The Chancellor made it clear to the Cabinet in July that his undertaking was likely to require &quot;one or two quite large policy savings i.e., the elimination orcurtailment of particular services both in the civil and in the defence fields . . . &quot;.The Treasury report circulated with C (61) 88 listed &quot;possible fields for
consideration &quot;, including &quot; family allowances . . . ; removal of the subsidy on welfare milk . . . ; increased charges in the health service or in school meals orin university education &quot;.14. It will be necessary for me shortly to put forward definite proposals about this, and how we are to proceed in order to fulfil what has been promised.Particular Problems15. There are a number of major questions before Ministers in which it is ofgreat importance to reach sound decisions without delay. Indeed, if we fail to doso, we cannot have any kind of real plan for containing the growth of public expenditure.   I would emphasise:(i) Defence. We shall need to settle a long-term Defence policy within thelimits laid down in a recent memorandum circulated to the DefenceCommittee. The Minister of Defence has told me that he is working on this problem and will discuss it further with me as soon as he is ready. Prima facie, it may involve some difficult decisions, and meanwhile I am most anxious to avoid solving particular problems ina way which may prejudice our long-term policy.(ii) Agriculture. Distasteful as it is, we are forced to go to Parliament before christmas for a large Supplementary Estimate arising out of the lastPrice Review. We clearly cannot do this without making proposalsfor containing runaway growth in the Bill for Agriculture.(iii) Education. The size of the educational building programme for the next three or four years, and the rate of growth of current expenditure on education, are perhaps the most crucial unresolved questions in thelong-term public expenditure plan. The Minister and I agree that wehave got to ask for a decision on this shortly, as we have been unableto settle it ourselves.(iv) Assistance to the Aircraft Industry. We discussed this in Cabinet on19th October (C.C. (61) 57th Conclusions) and agreed to consider anumber of projects, some in the near future and others (including thesupersonic airliner) in the longer term (C.C. (61) 57th Conclusions,Minute 2). We have to decide how best to apply in this field theprinciples for assistance to industry announced by the Chancellor on26th July.(v) BLUE   STREAK. However   successful   our   European   launcher development Organisation venture may be even if all the countrieswhich have been invited to take part agree to do so the UnitedKingdom will have assumed a substantial new burden. If the size ofthis burden were to be significantly increased by the defection of someprospective member countries, I am sure we should have to look at theposition carefully with a view to deciding how much this project is reallyworth to the United Kingdom.(vi) Coal. It would be fatal to any kind of long-term plan if we allowed the critical situation of the National Coal Board to become a drain on theExchequer either in advances which would never in fact be repaid,or in subsidy, or in writing off Government-guaranteed capital (which comes to the same thing as a subsidy). Failure would result in a furtheroutpouring of public funds to shore up inefficient industry.16. We are much more likely in my judgment to reach right decisions and decisions which will stick, instead of having to be reopened time after time in crisisafter crisis if we can look at them in the framework of public expenditure as awhole, over a period of time, and matched against prospective gross national product. This is what the Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure underthe Chairmanship of Lord Plowden recommended, and it is what Parliament andpublic opinion expect of us. I am certain we shall find that, if we boldly carry out this policy, the effectiveness of the whole range of our economic policies and performance will be vastly improved, and our recurrent difficulties in other directions will shrink.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,29th November, 1961.
