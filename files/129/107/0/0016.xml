(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 16624th October, 1961CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of power the National Coal Board have proposed to me selectiveincreases in coal prices in three of their highest-loss Divisions - Scotland,South Western and North Western.   These proposals raise difficultiesof particular severity in the case of Scotland, which have been considered at two meetings of the Coal Imports Committee and were the subject of areport by an inter-Departmental Committee of officials.2. The need for some action has become urgent.   the accumulated deficit of the Board is now far greater than their internalreserves.   Although there are also some losses in the Northern and DurhamDivisions, losses have been particularly heavy in Scotland, Wales andthe North-West.   During the last eight years more than  100 millionshas been lost in Scotland, compared  with the total national deficit of 70 millions at the end of last year.   The loss in Scotland was 17s. 9da ton in I960 and is still growing.   There have been losses of over  2 a tonin the West Wales anthracite coalfield, and in the North Western Division(Lancashire and North Wales) the loss last year was 7s. 9d a ton.3. The Board now propose:-(a) To increase Scottish prices by an average of nearly 15s.a ton   from 1st January, 1962.(b) To increase the price of South Wales anthracite and boilerfuel by 30s. a ton, of which 10s. will become effective at the beginningof next month and  1 will be added during the course of next year.(c) To increase the price of coal in the North WesternDvision by 6s. a ton from 1st January, 1962.These increases should lead to some reduction in demand which will makeit easier to close down more of the Board&apos;s high cost pits.   A big programmeof closures has already been planned for all three Divisions and also for the Durham and Northern Divisions.   Against the background of theWhite Paper on the Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised industries (Cmndj 1337), the Board is also considering whether otherselective price increases should be made to eliminate any remaininglosses on its operations in England and Wales.-1-COPY NO.^b
4. My colleagues on the Coal Imports Committee were naturallyconcerned by the severity of these proposals.   Some Ministers were opposedin principle to the wish of the Board to make selective increases in orderto bring prices into a better relationship with costs.   They pointed outthat the Cabinet had previously rejected such proposals on the grounds thatcoal was a single industry and that the price should be broadly the sameover the whole country.   I was therefore asked to report to the Cabineton this issue of principle and to find out the views of the Chairman of theNational Coal Board, Bord Robens, on the financial and other consequenceshe would expect if he had to make good the Board1 s deficit by some alternative means such as a national increase.5. Lord Robens thinks that a general increase of prices mustbe avoided.   He believes that the confidence of industry in the stability of general coal prices would be seriously undermined by an increase ofthis kind.   A relatively small general increase in coal prices would makemany turn to oil.   Nor does he think the profitable Divisions are themselvessecure enough to continue to carry the heavy losers.6. I agree with Lord Robens that the whole future of theindustry depends on the ability of the low-cost coalfields to compete withother sources of energy-  if they are not free, and encouraged, &quot;to takeadvantage of their lower production costs, their economic indigenousproduction will be replaced by oil and other fuels.7. Moreover, the decision as to which coals should be increased in price, and by how much, is of great commercial significance and oughtto be taken by the Board.   A refusal of this commercial freedom wouldbe hard to justify after the publication of the White Paper and after thestatement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Parliament on 26th July,that the Government would leave the nationalised industries as muchfreedom as possible in fixing their prices.8. It has been argued that all coal of a given quality, whatever its costs of production, should be sold at about the same price.   This isnot the  position today.   Not only does the price of coal delivered tothe consumer vary according to the cost of transport from the coalfields,but the pithead prices also vary from Division to Division.   The basicelement in pithead price is the quality of the coal, but this is supplementedin each Division by a special &quot;coalfield addition&quot; which makes some allowance for the local cost of production.   Uniformity in price even at thepithead would, therefore, amount to the application of an entirely newprinciple to the coal price structure.9. The present proposal as regards Scotland is in effect toraise the &quot;coalfield addition&quot; so as to  bring Scottish prices more closelyinto line with the cost of production.   Scottish coal consumers have gainedin the past because the pithead price of their coal was uneconomicallylow and because most of them are situated on or near the coalfields.   Itis difficult to justify allowing them to continue to enjoy both of these advantages.   It is no more unfair that Scottish coal consumers should payhigher prices for their coal because of the higher costs of producing it,than that consumers in other parts of the country should pay higher pricesbecause of the higher cost of transport.-2-CONFI DENTS AL
CONFIDENTIAL12910. I believe that a refusal of the Board1 s proposals couldonly be sustained on the grounds of the social consequences in Scotland.If refusal were justified on these grounds, it would be hard to impose the social burden on the coal industry.11. I therefore ask the Cabinet to accept the principle thatthe Board should be allowed to introduce a closer relationship betweencoal prices and costs of production, and to approve the proposals setout in paragraph 3 above.R; F.
