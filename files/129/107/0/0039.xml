Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 189 Copy &quot;No.     5823rd November, 1961CABINETDECIMALISATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in May of last year a Committee of the British Association and the Associationof British Chambers of Commerce published a report on the decimalisation of the currency, to the effect that there was widespread approval for the change. since then, and particularly since we announced our intention to apply for membership of the European Economic Community, I have been pressed for a statement on theGovernment^ attitude, and I have promised to make one before the end of the year.I have, however, held the matter up in response to a request to do so by theAustralian Federal Treasurer and the New Zealand Minister of Finance. I have since had an opportunity of discussing the matter with them at the Accra conference.2. The subject has been studied by a Working Party of officials, and I attachtheir report. It will be seen that officials are agreed on the substantial advantages to be derived from decimalisation but have reservations about the cost. There ismuch ground for believing that the adoption of a decimal system would lead to agreat saving of time and money in the long run; against that we must weigh, in the short run, the inconvenience to the public and the cost of the change, both to the economy and the Exchequer: in addition there is sentiment and naturalconservatism.  On balance, I favour the change subject to what follows.Cost MSf;3. The total cost to the economy as a whole is bound to be substantial, thegreater part arising from the necessity of replacing or converting the ever-growing number of monetary machines of all kinds (calculating and accounting machines,cash registers, etc.). Included in this will be a sizeable cost to public funds, for the planning of the operation and the necessary publicity, the introduction of new coinsand notes, as well as the cost of replacing or converting machines and other equipment, stationery, text books, etc., in Government Departments, localauthorities and schools. In addition we shall no doubt be pressed to providecompensation for private interests affected by the change (see paragraphs 6-8 below).4. At the moment we have no informed estimate of what either the total costor the Exchequer part of it may be. The Working Party guessed that it might bein the neighbourhood of  200 millions, but before any reliable estimate can beproduced, we need to know a great deal more than we do, particularly about thenumber and age-distribution of the monetary machines in use in the country.Moreover, there must also be a detailed study, in the light of this and other information, of the best way of introducing and timing the changeover, so as to minimise its cost.   In an operation of this kind the opportunities for reducingTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
wasteful expenditure by careful attention to timing should be substantial. to illustrate this it is only necessary to point out that if the change were made at short notice and everywhere at once, the cost would include the full value of replacingor converting all the machines in the country, whereas if it could be done aftersufficient notice, and phased according to the expected life of the machines, so that none was replaced until it was worn out, the cost of this part of the change wouldbe nil. Of course, neither of these theoretical extremes is feasible: the task is tofind the appropriate timing and phasing that will be the best, having regard to all^factors, including cost.5. This will call for a large scale investigation, in which some GovernmentDepartments, local authorities and nationalised industries will have to take part, andwhich will have to get a good deal of information about the age and distribution of machines in private hands. It would be better to embark on this after we had publicly declared ourselves to be in favour of decimalisation in principle: we should probably get more realistic results: on the other hand it would not be right to commit ourselves irrevocably until we can consider what the costs, on the bestplanning assumptions, would be. I therefore agree with the Working Party that, ifwe decide in favour of the change in principle we should announce that decision.At the same time we should announce our intention to set up a PreparatoryCommission to investigate the matters I have just described, the final decision,including the timing of the changeover itself to be settled in the light of theCommission^ findings. It will be necessary to keep the period of uncertainty asshort as possible, so that it must be made clear to the Commission that they mustcarry out their task with all possible speed. If, in the light of their report, it weredefinitely decided to go ahead, it would probably be convenient to keep theCommission in being to carry out the operation.Compensation6. The questions of cost discussed in the preceding paragraphs arise and mustbe settled sometime, however that cost may be distributed between the exchequer on the one hand and private interests on the other. The costs to the exchequer would be substantially increased if the Government were to assume liability for compensating, either wholly or in part, those private interests on whom the costs would otherwise fall. The matter is examined in paragraphs 18-20 of the working party report. No doubt there will be pressure on us to pay compensation both onthe South African precedent, and on the analogy of assistance to householders insmokeless zones.7. I think we must resist any immediate statement on this for the following reasons. In the first place, an announcement that the Government proposed to compensate 100 per cent, would remove any incentives to economise in convertingor replacing machines, and thus might greatly increase the cost of the operation;the important thing is to reduce the cost to the economy as a whole, and before we think about compensation we ought to ascertain, by means of the proposedsurvey, what the bill is likely to amount to and how it can be kept to the minimumby careful planning. Secondly, if we were to compensate for the change todecimalisation we should set a precedent which would be difficult to escape fromif we should decide to change our weights and measures to the metric system.Thirdly, while it might be practicable to compensate owners of machines, it would hardly be feasible to compensate everybody who might be adversely affected;this would give rise to charges of inequity. Finally, about half the cost, on the machine side, will fall on the Exchequer in any case, through tax allowances ordeduction in assessing business profits, and this might well be accepted as effectivelysharing the burden reasonably fairly.8. In my view, therefore, we should avoid accepting at this stage any liabilityexpressed or implied for compensation if we possibly can. In any case we ought toavoid committing ourselves until we have the Preparatory Commission^ estimateof the cost, and take our final decision.The New Units9. The new unit for our currency is an important matter and must, I think,be announced in our first statement since it will be basic to the PreparatoryCommission^ work.  The arguments are fully set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of
the report. Briefly those in favour of a system based on 10 shillings divided into100 units (i.e,, 10 shillings divided each into 10 pennies) are as follows:(a) It is easy for people to understand and operate since all the existing coinsdown to 6d. are in a precise decimal relationship (for example7s. 6d. = -75, 14s. 6d. = 1-45, etc.).(b) It would keep us in line with other Commonwealth countries.(c) If we keep the   as the basic unit not only would most existing coins haveto be replaced but the sub-unit would be the florin and one-tenth ofthat whatever it was called would be equal to 2-4d., i.e., too large asub-unit (almost 2^d.). The alternative of dividing the   into 1,000sub-units gives a sub-unit which is too small (less than the farthingwe have just demonetised), as well as the disadvantage of three places of decimals.10. There are two difficulties about the 10 shilling basis. The first is thatall past records public and private based on the pound sterling, including allfinancial statistics, would have to be adjusted (although only by doubling) tomake them comparable with current figures in the new unit. The second is thata hundredth part of 10 shillings, which would thus become the smallest unit,would be equivalent to 1-2 of our present penny, which is rather large for fineshading of prices, and might tend to a general rounding upwards of small costitems at present expressed in halfpennies. It might therefore be necessary to divide it into two parts. Though this sub-division could be ignored (as thehalfpenny is to-day) over a wide range of accounting, there would still be cases in which the third decimal place would have to be used, thus sacrificing someof the simplicity of a two-decimal place system. -We should also have to finda new name for the basic unit of ten shillings.11.   On balance I favour the 10 shilling unit divided into 100 units.Timing12. There are two main considerations which suggest to me that a decision in principle ought not to be postponed much longer. The first is that mechanicalmethods of calculating and accounting are still rapidly developing, and the costto the economy of converting to decimals might be very much heavier in a fewyears than it would be now. The second is that, as more and more countries have changed over in recent years to a decimal system, the United Kingdom may soon be the only important country to remain outside. Within the Commonwealth,India and Pakistan have decimalised their coinage, and Australia and NewZealand are committed in principle to taking similar action. South Africaintroduced the change earlier this year. The countries of the European economic community have long been on a decimal system. If we are ever to make this change, the time is now ripe for it.13. The timing of the further stages of the operation will also need close examination, not only from the point of view of minimising cost, but also witha view to our keeping in step with Australia and New Zealand. It seems clear in any case that a substantial period will have to elapse in each country fromthe time when the final decision is taken, before a new system could effectivelyoperate. Although it is not essential that, if we change, we should all change asnear the same time as possible, nevertheless I would propose, before making any announcement, to communicate with the Australian Federal Treasurer and withthe Finance Minister of New Zealand with a view to our making co-ordinatedstatements about our respective intentions.Conclusions14.   I invite my colleagues to agree: -(a) that we should announce now that in principle we favour decimalisation,but should defer the final decision until we have adequate estimates ofthe cost, and of its incidence;(b) that the basis of the new system should be the 10 shilling unit divided into100 parts;
id) that a Preparatory Commission be set up to undertake the preliminarysurvey as a matter of urgency, and suggest a phasing for the further stages of the operation, with a view to minimising the costs;id) that no decision be taken about compensation from the Exchequer to private interests, until the Commission have reported;(e) that, subject to consultation on timing with the Australian and NewZealand Governments, I should make a statement on the lines of id) id) above as soon as possible, and in any case, not later than theend of the year.S.

ANNEX    .REPORT OF THE WORKING PARTY OF: OFFICIALS ON DECIMAL.   CURRENCY .    ;-137 years have passed since a Motion of the House of Commons recommended&quot; the application of the decimal scale &quot; to coins and during that period the subjecthas been under almost continuous discussion in one form or another. We havenot therefore been surprised to find that there is relatively little that we can say onthis question which has not been said many times before. The broad proposition that the most convenient systems of measurement (whether of money or of weights and measures) are those which are based on the same scale as the system of notation(i.e., a decimal scale) is sufficiently self-evident to require little argument, eventhough some theorists may lament that the modern world has adopted a decimalrather than a duo-decimal system of numbering.2. The general arguments in favour of decimalisation which are usuallyregarded as carrying most weight are:(a) Money calculations would be simplified and could therefore be carried outwith less time and effort and fewer mistakes. Thinly spread as the benefit would be over the whole community the aggregate saving to thecommunity would be substantial.(b) The teaching of arithmetic would be simplified since money calculationswould be no different from most other types of calculations. Thiswould represent a saving of educational effort which would be of bothpractical and psychological value.3. There are in addition two considerations bearing directly on the questionwhich are of recent origin:(a) South Africa, India and Pakistan have already gone over to a decimalsystem. Australia and New Zealand are committed in principle tointroduce a decimal currency. There is a possibility of similar changesin Rhodesia, Ghana and elsewhere. There is thus a great danger thatour currency which has linked us to the Commonwealth in the pastwill come to separate us from them if we do not also change. Moreover,there is a fair probability that, in the comparatively near future, theUnited Kingdom (with the Irish Republic) may find itself the onlycountry of any consequence in the world with a non-decimal currency.(b) The widespread and rapid development of mechanised calculating andaccounting equipment involves two disadvantages under our presentsystem. The first is that within United Kingdom businesses and organisations it is normally impossible to use the same machines to perform both money calculations and other types of calculations, sincerelatively few office machines are capable of working both on a   s. d.and a decimal basis. This leads to waste and duplication of machinery.The second disadvantage is that United Kingdom firms making addingmachines, cash registers and similar appliances for export to marketswith decimal currencies have to run a second production line with someconsequent increase in costs.In short, the difficulties arising from our use of the sterling system and our isolationwill be worsened as time goes on.4. At Appendix A we have attempted to set out what we conceive to be thestate of public opinion which it might be fair to summarise as follows. There isa growing feeling among many sections of the community that although ourpresent currency system works perfectly well a decimal currency is desirable inprinciple and there is a suspicion that the United Kingdom is in danger in someway of falling behind the rest of the world unless the change is made. Few peoplehold sufficiently strong views against decimalisation to offer any serious resistance to the change. The great majority of those people who support decimalisation haveno more than a limited understanding of the issues involved, and have failed
squarely to face the difficulties arising from the choice of system and the heavyinitial cost both to the economy and to the Exchequer. On the other hand, in so faras responsible bodies and individuals have applied their minds to the subjectseriously, there have been indications that the initial instinctive assumption thatthe pound must be retained does not always survive second thoughts.5. Both for the general reasons mentioned in paragraph 2, which are alreadywell-known and generally accepted, and for the more specific reasons mentionedin paragraph 3, we believe that important advantages could be obtained by adopting a decimal currency. But a decision on this question could not rest on theoreticalconsiderations. The practical questions at issue are:(a) Whether it is possible to devise a decimal currency which would representa marked improvement on our present system and would, at the sametime, be generally acceptable; and, if so (b) Whether the initial  cost,  inconvenience  and confusion  which  theintroduction of such a system would involve would be adequatelycompensated by the long-term advantages.We examine these two main considerations the choice of system and the costof the changeover in the next two sections of this Report.The Choice of System6.   There are three main requirements for any new system of currency:(a) It should be convenient.  The major and minor units should be so chosenas to make the majority of money calculations, whether mechanical,1 - written or mental, as simple as possible.   The major unit should be neither so small that the cost of quite common articles runs into a stringof noughts, nor so large as to be a very large multiple of the minor unit.(b) The new system should be related as directly as possible to the old.  Themore closely it can be identified with the old system, the less the problemsof change. It is of great help to the public during the period of transition if prices in the old system can be translated simply into prices in the new. The amount of amendment necessary to old accounts and records is minimised. And it is a great advantage if coins of the new system correspond with denominations of the old. The correspondingnew coins can then be of the same size and weight as the old; old andnew can circulate side by side indefinitely; slot machines need not be altered; and users are not confused by a totally unfamiliar series ofcoins.(c) It must be acceptable to public opinion at home and abroad.. 7. No system for a decimal currency in the United Kingdom can whollysatisfy all these requirements. We have examined four possible systems, whoseadvantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed below:(a) A System Based on the PennyThis seems to have little to commend it. Both the minor and the major unit (100 pence=8s. 4d.) are of reasonably convenient size thelatter slightly larger than a dollar. But the new major unit would stand inan extremely awkward relationship to the pound. At the outset,therefore, all statistics, contracts and records of any sort expressed inpounds would have to be multiplied by 2-4. And a similar awkwardrelationship would exist between the new decimal coins and the oldcoins. Indeed, apart from the halfpenny and the penny, no existingcoin could satisfactorily continue to circulate for any length of time.Moreover, the resulting system would be quite unlike those which havebeen or seem likely to be adopted in other Commonwealth countries.(b) A System Based on the Pound Divided into 1,000 &quot; mils&quot;All coins down to the 6d., with the exception of the halfcrown, arein convenient decimal relation to the major unit; the halfcrown(125 mils) is reasonably convenient and the threepence (12^ mils) isnot so remote that it could not be easily understood. The penny wouldhave to be replaced.   A pure decimal system would have some
CONFIDENTIAL7advantages over a system involving fractions. But it would beabandoning one system of currency which is different from most others in the world in order to adopt another which is still different: theEgyptian is one of the few existing currencies divided into 1,000 parts.The disadvantages of such an arrangement would be:(i) The introduction of a minor unit of less value than the farthing,which has just been demonetised, but which would almost certainly have to be minted as a separate coin;(ii) the need in ordinary day-to-day transactions to have to work to three places of decimals, and(hi) having a system under which very small transactions anythingabove 2s. in present terms would involve a price running into100s.None of us felt that we could support the adoption of this system.(c) A System Based on the Pound Divided into 100 centsThe ten shilling note, florin and shilling are exact decimal fractions;the half crown (12^ cents) and sixpence (2% cents) are reasonablycomprehensible; both the threepence (1  cents) and the penny must bereplaced. There are two principal drawbacks to this system, onetransitional and the other more permanent. The transitional difficulty is that some relatively sophisticated mental arithmetic would in manycases be required to associate values under the new and old systems.For example, 3s. 6d. would become 17^ cents and  1 15s. Od. wouldbecome  1-75. In practice, the ordinary citizen would find this toodifficult and would be obliged to use a conversion table. The morelasting drawback of this system is that the cent would be worth almost2^d. which is too large to serve as the smallest unit it will not allow of fine enough shading in low prices. A half-cent would certainly benecessary ^almost l d.) and if it were wished to retain the equivalent ofthe halfpenny a quarter-cent would also be needed. While neither the half nor quarter-cent would probably be used as a unit of account by banks, etc., this would involve a departure from a truly decimalsystem whose implications we examine more fully below. The principaladvantage of this system is, of course, that it retains the present name and value of the pound sterling. Apart from the considerations oftradition, prestige and confidence which we discuss below, the advantages of avoiding any need to adjust the mass of financial statistics and otherrecords which are at present stated in whole pounds are self-evident.(d) A System Based on 10s. Divided into 100 centsThis is the system which has been adopted in South Africa andwhich is favoured in New Zealand. Though the Decimal CurrencyCommittee in Australia unanimously recommended that the decimalcoinage should be based on a 10s.-cent unit there is some opinion inthe Government which would prefer retention of the pound as the major unit. All existing coins down to and including 6d. are in precisedecimal relation to the unit, for which some alternative name wouldhave to be found; 3d. i^2\ cents) is comprehensible; the penny wouldhave to be replaced. The association of values between old and newsystems is relatively simple (e.g., ls^lO cents; 8s. 6d^85 cents; 1 15s. Od^3-5 units); sums expressed in whole pounds have to bedoubled. It is now clear that in South Africa, with a population lessliterate than that of the United Kingdom, the change has been madesurprisingly smoothly, apart from a little initial trouble over theassociation of cents and pennies (though it is to be noted that south africans had to be provided with pocket ready reckoners, as peopledoubtless would need to be here). Since the cent would be worthabout l^d. it might be necessary to have a half-cent, but this, like thehalfpenny to-day, would not be a unit of account in banks or many other types of business. The disadvantage of this system is that itwould require the adjustment (though only by doubling) of pastfinancial statistics, contracts, salaries and records based on wholepounds if continuity were to be maintained.   It would also involve
the abandonment of the pound sterling as the unit of United Kingdomcurrency. As against this, subject to the decision to be taken by australia, retention of the pound would mean that we no longer shareda unit with the Commonwealth.8. The Bank of England representatives are not satisfied that the pound couldbe abandoned as our unit of currency without an appreciable adverse effect onthe international standing and repute of sterling. They argue that the pound isand has been for centuries an international unit of account, and that it is familiarto and respected by all who are concerned in international financial transactionswhether on a large scale or a small. They feel that opinion abroad would beshaken by the abandonment of this familiar unit, and that the results for thestanding of the currency could be serious. They are, however, in favour ofdecimalisation in principle, and would therefore recommend adoption of a /cent/fraction system, accepting the admitted disadvantages which such a system would entail. They are not convinced that it would necessarily be essential to incur the admitted extra inconvenience of introducing a quarter-cent.9. The remainder of the Working Party feel that the drawbacks of eithersystem based on the pound are sufficiently serious to call in question the justification for making the change at all. As to the  /cent system, they doubt whether publicopinion would regard it as reasonable to abandon our familiar coinage if afterthe change vulgar fractions were a common feature of everyday shopping. Theuse of fractions would also have major implications from the point of view of design of office machines. A half-cent can be accommodated on a simple decimal machine if expressed as - 5&apos; at the cost of losing one column. A quarter-cent if expresseddecimally (-25) loses two columns; if expressed as a vulgar fraction it involves the use of special machines, with a i-J-J column- applicable only to calculationsof United Kingdom currency transactions. Either way this involves the sacrifice of a good deal of the simplification of calculating machinery which is one of the strongest arguments in favour of decimalisation. Admittedly, banks and someother institutions would merely ignore the fractions (just as to-day they ignore the halfpenny). But shops and many other businesses could not do so and there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that a decimal system based on the pound would be bound to involve half-cents and perhaps quarters. The possibilityof a half-cent admittedly has to be faced under a 10s. system but, like the quarter-cent, under the   system, it might prove small enough to be ignored fairly widely.10. On the other hand, the other members of the Working Party do not share the anxieties of the Bank of England about the effects of abandoning the  .They feel that the international standing of sterling depends rather on the underlyingstrength of the economy than on the unit used, and that if sterling is basicallystrong it will retain the respect of the foreigner whether the   be retained or no.In any case the   would not disappear overnight; there would be a period of atleast three years during which international opinion could become accustomed to the idea of the change, and could be fully informed of the reasons for it. some members of the group felt indeed that to retain the   might harm our reputationinternationally, since a decision to adopt a decimal system with such manifestdisadvantages might lend some colour to the image of the United Kingdom as a country inhibited by devotion to tradition from taking full advantage of modernideas. These members of the Working Party would therefore recommenddecimalisation on a 10s./cent basis.Cost of Decimalisation11. The transitional or immediate cost of adopting a decimal currency would fall under four heads:(a) The conversion of monetary machines to decimal operation or of replacingthose too old or otherwise unsuitable for conversion. This involves a wide variety of appliances ranging from the most elaborate forms of mechanical accounting and calculating to the simpler cash registersin shops, petrol pumps, taxi-meters, etc. and possibly (depending onthe changes made in the coinage) slot machines, coin-operated locks, etc.(b) The cost of replacing such things as text-books, sales literature, pricetickets, etc.
CONFIDENTIAL9(c) The cost to the community in time, material and effort of the delays,confusion and inconvenience of the changeover.(d) The cost of manufacturing new coins and bank notes.Conversion of Machinery12. No up-to-date official estimates are available of the number of machinesof various types which would need to be converted to decimal operations or replacedor of the cost which would be involved. The office machine manufacturers preparedsome figures in 1959 for the British Association and Chambers of CommerceCommittees (whose report is discussed in Appendix A below) which suggested atotal cost of about  130 millions, of which about  50 millions was attributable tocash registers,  65 millions to adding, calculating and accounting machines, and therest to price-computing scales (in shops), coin machines, taxi-meters, etc. Thesefigures are the best indeed the only estimate at present available and there seemsno reason to doubt that they at least reflect accurately the order of magnitude ofthe problem. They are, however, already about two years out of date and on theearliest timetable for decimalisation which would be practicable they could hardly be less than 5 years out of date by the time of the changeover. It seems virtuallycertain, therefore, that the extended use of accounting machines and rising costs would require a substantial upward revision of the estimate mentioned above.There is no means of judging by how much it ought to be increased but on thesame basis of estimating, the total cost of machine conversion and replacementwould probably be approaching  200 millions. But any such estimate can belittle more than a guess in the absence of any census of the machines involved, theirage structure, the length of their normal life and without any decision on the lengthof the period of the changeover as it is clear that the cost will depend largely onthe length of the period of the changeover in relation to the life of the machines.13. The expenditure would not be without economic benefit although this toocannot readily be quantified. Experience in South Africa suggests that the costof cash accounting machines may be substantially cut (there the cost of decimalmachines worked out at half, or even less, of the  . s. d. machines). This couldamount to significant benefit to the United Kingdom economy since it is estimatedthat about  20 millions a year is spent on new office machines not all of which willbe in   s. d. cash accounting machines. In addition, savings will accrue becausedecimal machines are much cheaper to maintain and service than   s. d. machines.There are also savings to be expected for users of machines for purposes otherthan sterling calculations, e.g., those which have to keep accounts &quot;for foreign currency or those which do stores accounting by machines. They will be able tohave one set of machines where hitherto they had two with the consequent capitalsavings on equipment and accommodation.Cost in Time, Effort and Material of the Changeover14. Any major change in the currency system would inevitably impose a burden on the economy in a variety of ways, most of which are incapable ofmeasurement. A great deal of effort would be needed to train all sections of thecommunity to handle the new system. Even so, for a year or more it would haveto be accepted that unfamiliarity with the decimal system would lead to delaysand mistakes and would necessitate additional training and checking of staffdealing with money transactions. It is impossible to guess what the total costto the community in this sort of way might be. But there can be no doubt thatthere would be an initial cost of this sort and we feel bound to draw attentionto it. The time and cost of changing past financial records, statistics, etc., if a10s. system were introduced would fall into this category.15. Here too the short-term initial cost would have to be set against thelong-term benefits. By their very nature these are intangible but the following are relevant considerations:(i) it is estimated that nearly half of the time spent on arithmetic in juniorforms in schools is spent on money sums. In a decimal system moneysums are the same as any others and there should therefore be saving inteaching time which could be devoted to giving pupils a wider education;(ii) a South African building society claims some striking savings in timeand greater accuracy in the conduct of their day-to-day business
- particularly on calculations previously involving the conversion of1 percentages into   s. d. figures. Controlled experiments conducted bythe Australian Decimal Currency Committee into typical shopping andpayroll calculations established that with a decimal currency therewas a saving in time of 25 per cent. There is obviously scope for similareconomies over the whole field of money calculations.Cost of Manufacturing New Coins16. Some notes prepared by the Royal Mint on the coinage aspects of theproblem are set out in Appendix B. It is a feature common to the  /cent/fractionand to the 10s./cent systems that all the existing cupro-nickel denominations wouldhave exact decimal equivalents and could remain in circulation at least temporarilybut that the cent or fractions of a cent would have no exact equivalent in theexisting system. Unless therefore pennies and halfpennies were to be re-valuedupwards and retained in use (which would create serious dirncuities) it would benecessary to have adequate supplies of 1 cent and \ cent (and on the  /cent systemalso \ cent) coins ready for issue at the date of changeover. It seems unlikely thaton any system that might be adopted the immediate cost of re-coinage would bemore than  6 millions to  10 millions or the ultimate cost more than  5 millions(see Appendix B).Cost of Introducing New Notes17. The  /cent system would not necessitate alteration to notes of  1 and upwards although with a decimal currency it might be considered desirable tointroduce a  2 note. While it would seem unnecessary to have 50 cent (10s.) notesavailable at the date of changeover this might nevertheless be desirable. The costof preparing and introducing this one new note would not be a major factor. Witha 10s. unit all notes would require replacement and, although existing notes couldfor a time circulate side by side with new notes, it would seem desirable to have a reasonably rapid changeover. Presumably the range would cover 1, 2, 5, 10 and20 units and while the total cost might not be a major factor, production andstockpiling would have a bearing on the timetable of the operation.Incidence of Cost18. The heavy expense of converting accounting and other machines todecimal operation which was discussed in paragraph 12 above inevitably raises thequestion on whom the cost should fall. Some part will have to be borne directly by the Exchequer in meeting the cost of converting or replacing equipment in service with Government Departments. There is no estimate of the amount butit could amount to as much as 20 per cent, of the total.19. For the rest it might well be argued that, in so far as a decision todecimalise would be based on the conviction that in the long term the convenienceand economy of a decimal system would outweigh the immediate cost of the transition, every owner of an accounting or calculating machine could expectin the long run to gain from the change and could therefore reasonably be expectedto meet the cost of converting his machine to the new system. On the other hand,the argument would doubtless be advanced that since the advantages ofdecimalisation would accrue to the community as a whole and not to individualinterests, the direct and measurable financial burden resulting from it should beborne by the community as a whole through the medium of the Exchequer. Therelative merits, of these conflicting arguments require further examination in thelight of the considerations in paragraphs 12 and 13. Three points should, however,be noted: / .., .(d) The South African Government1 have accepted the second argument that the main cost of converting and replacing machines should be borneby the Exchequer. They have accordingly undertaken to meet virtuallythe whole cost of conversion and a substantial proportion of the cost of replacing those machines which are not convertible. This precedentwould doubtless be quoted in support of claims for compensation inthe United Kingdom.(b) The provisions for assistance to householders in smokeless zones whoinstall grates suitable for burning smokeless fuel provides a recent
CONFIDENTIAL11precedent in this country for allowing financial relief in a case wherethe ultimate benefit of the community at large involves a financial. burden on individuals.(c) Under the normal tax law the cost of converting or replacing accountingand similar machines is likely in most cases either to be deductible in assessing business profits to tax or to rank for investment allowances.For this reason the Inland Revenue estimate that not less than half thecost of conversion and replacement (estimated in paragraph 12 as being in the region of  200 millions) would fall effectively on the Exchequereven if there were no direct scheme for compensation. How this wouldbe spread over the years would depend on how much of theexpenditure was regarded as on current and how much on capital account. The probability would seem to be that the cost to theExchequer under the normal provisions of the tax law and even withoutany special provisions for compensation would not be very far short of  100 millions and that anything from  20 millions to  50 millions ofthis might fall in the first year.20. The indirect and largely intangible costs of decimalisation mentionedin paragraph 14 would presumably have to be borne wherever they happened to fall. Any suggestion that compensation should be paid to cover costs other thanthose for the conversion or replacement of machinery could reasonably be resistedon the grounds that those institutions (such as the banks) for whom the transitionalburden was the heaviest would stand to gain most in the long run from the benefits of a decimal system.Foreign Exchange Cost21. A change to a decimal currency is not expected to have any significantlong-term effect on exports or imports generally but the effect on the monetarymachinery industries could be considerable and, because the bigger users tend tostick to one type, long-lasting. The total annual output of the major part (cashregisters and accounting machines) is about  35 millions of which about a thirdis exported, more than a third of the exports going to countries which have or arechanging over to a decimal currency. The leading manufacturers, who do mostof the exports, are branches of American-owned international concerns. Ifadequate notice and time for planning and preparation is given, there should notbe much danger of these firms reducing their activities in the United Kingdomand there would be a better chance of persuading the manufacturers to maintain their export effort during this period. And once the changeover is completedmanufacturers will be in a position to concentrate on production of decimalmachines which should enable them to reduce costs and thus to be more competitive in overseas markets. Adequate notice should also enable the industryto meet the home demand sufficiently to avoid an excessive increase in imports which are at present running at  8 millions per year. Particularly would this be thecase if it could be arranged for the conversion itself to be spread over a long period.Given time for a smooth changeover, the long-term effect on the industry&apos;s trade should not be great. The United Kingdom market may be more open to overseascompetitors but the United Kingdom industry should derive some saving in costs.Preparatory Steps22. As our Report makes clear the greatest uncertainty about embarking ona change to decimal currency is the cost. The  200 millions figure in paragraph 12,and any estimate of how much of this would fall on the Exchequer directly or indirectly are no more than guesses; but whatever the cost, even spread over anumber of years, there will be a substantial additional burden on the economy.To get a closer measure of this it would be necessary to embark on a ratherlonger term and more detailed survey than has been undertaken so far. Thiswould be expensive but an up-to-date census of the equipment which would beaffected by a change, including its age and normal life, would make it possible toarrive at a worthwhile appreciation of the size of the problem and the phasing ofthe changeover which would give the optimum benefits in keeping costs down.How this could best be done, without a disproportionate expenditure of time and money, we are not able to advise in any detail but we consider that an enquiry
precedent in this country for allowing financial relief in a case wherethe ultimate benefit of the community at large involves a financial burden on individuals.(c) Under the normal tax law the cost of converting or replacing accountingand similar machines is likely in most cases either to be deductible in assessing business profits to tax or to rank for investment allowances.For this reason the Inland Revenue estimate that not less than half thecost of conversion and replacement (estimated in paragraph 12 as being in the region of  200 millions) would fall effectively on the Exchequereven if there were no direct scheme for compensation. How this wouldbe spread over the years would depend on how much of theexpenditure was regarded as on current and how much on capital account. The probability would seem to be that the cost to theExchequer under the normal provisions of the tax law and even withoutany special provisions for compensation would not be very far short of  100 millions and that anything from  20 millions to  50 millions ofthis might fall in the first year.20.

covering the Post Office, the Stationery Office and a large nationalised body,together with a sample survey of the costs to private industry would afford a more accurate assessment of the costs involved, what the benefits would be and whattimetable would be most appropriate. The opportunity could also be taken atthe same time to get a better assessment of the relative merits of the arguments for and against compensation outlined in paragraph 19.23. We are of the opinion that, because of the risks involved in embarking on a project, the costs of which are so uncertain, an inquiry on the lines suggestedin the previous paragraph should be undertaken&apos; before a final decision to introduce a decimal currency is taken. It need hardly be said that following the taking andannouncement of a final decision by the Government there would still be a greatdeal of preparatory work to be done stretching over a number of years. In SouthAfrica the Government appointed a special commission to draw up plans andto supervise the whole operation under a whole-time Chairman drawn from outsidethe public service. We consider that some similar arrangement should be adoptedhere. As regards the length of the preparatory period we note that a period ofthree years was allowed in South Africa. An official committee in Australia has suggested a preparatory period of two years from the introduction of the necessary legislation. We think it probable that, in scale, the period between theannouncement of a final decision and the date of changeover could hardly be lessthan three years and might need to be longer.24. In particular, the machine manufacturers would need several years to plan and prepare for the changeover, and it would also be necessary to allow forunconverted or partially converted machines to continue in use for some time. Itmight also be for consideration whether steps ought to be taken to persuade usersnot to rush conversion immediately before or after the changeover so as to spread the demand.Conclusions25. It will be clear from what we have said that we are unable to reach agreement on all the questions that arise. Our conclusions may be summarisedas follows:(a) While we all believe that, if a suitable system can be devised, there are substantial advantages to be derived from decimalising the currency,uncertainty about the cost prevents us from concluding categoricallythat these advantages would, in the long run, justify the cost of theoperation particularly at a time when the cost would be additional toan already heavy investment programme. Our advice is therefore that before a final decision is taken there should be am enquiry on the lines suggested in paragraph 22: It would not be inconsistent with thiscautious approach for the Government to indicate publicly that theywere favourably disposed to a change to a decimal currency subject only to an assurance, by means of the proposed investigation, that thecost would be tolerable.(ft) We believe also that, though the inconveniences involved in the presentsystem are in our view exaggerated by foreign opinion, a change wouldhave a beneficial effect on the image which we present to the rest of theworld. ,(c) The Bank of England representatives feel that,, because of possible reactions upon the international standing and repute of sterlirig, toabandon the pound as the major unit of currency would be undesirable.They would be in favour of decimalisation on the basis of pound/cent/,fraction. . ,(d) While there are obvious difficulties in abandoning the pound, the remainder of the group would recommend decimalisation on the basis of the10s. / cent system. They believe that any system- of decimalisation basedon the pound would be so inconvenient as to sacrifice a significantamount of the advantage to be looked for from;a change and mightwell not be acceptable to public opinion at home. On the other hand,they would not expect the abandonment of the pound to have,the adverse effects on opinion abroad which the Bank of England fear.
APPENDIX ASTATE OF PUBLIC opinion the British Association and the Association of British Chambers ofCommerce appointed Committees in 1958 to enquire into the case for the adoptionof the metric system of weights and measures and for a decimal currency. TheCommittee received written evidence from a wide range of institutions, trade associations, local authorities, nationalised industries, learned and professionalsocieties, etc., but took no oral evidence and did not seek to discover the viewsof the man in the street. Their joint Report was published in May 1960 and its conclusion on the question of a decimal coinage Can be summarised as follows:(a) Decimalisation is primarily a domestic question.(b) There is widespread approval for it in principle.(c) Since the bodies consulted (including commercial representatives at her majesty&apos;s Missions overseas) showed an overwhelming wish to retain the   as the major unit, the Joint Committees thought that the /mil system would probably be the best decimal system.(d) The cost to the country of converting machines, etc., would be heavy, butnot unduly large in relation to the resources of the country.(e) Decimalisation of the currency should precede adoption of metric weights and measures.The Report recognised th at the Government would need to test public opinionbefore reaching a decision but strongly recommended that an early decision shouldbe taken, since the longer a decision was delayed the greater would be the cost of achange if it were eventually made.The publication of the Joint Report did less to arouse general publicinterest in the question of decimalisation than might have been expected. although a majority of the organisations consulted had expressed themselves as favouringin principle the adoption of a decimal currency most of their replies suggested thattheir thinking had not,gone very deep. The widespread assumption, for example,that it would be desirable to retain the   as the major unit appears to havebeen based more on an instinctive reaction than to an appraisal of the factors involved. In a statement in Parliament in June 1960 the then Chancellor of theExchequer drew particular attention to the importance of the choice of a decimalsystem and encouraged public discussion on the subject. However, a debate inthe House of Lords in November 1960 attracted only three speakers, other thanthe mover and the Government spokesman and lasted no more than an hour.Early in 1961, however, at about the time when the decimal currencycame into operation in South Africa, there were signs of some quickening of publicinterest:(a) The Institute of Chartered Accountants issued a statement supporting inprinciple the adoption of a decimal currency and recommending the10s./cent system. This statement is reproduced at Appendix C.(b) A Political and Economic Planning report supported the principle ofdecimalisation (but offered no clear view on the choice of system).(c) A good deal of discussion of the question took place in the Press, and pollsof readers&apos; opinions were conducted in the Daily Mirror and Daily-, &apos; Mail. For what they were worth the results were as follows:Daily MirrorVoters in favour of decimal coinageUnder 16 years of age   ;.. -Between 16 and 20 years&apos;     Between 21 and 30 years       \.78 per cent.63 per cent.68 per cent.Voters against, changing to decimal coinageAged 31 and over        ... v   ...      i54 per cent.
Daily MailIn favour ..Against ; ..Don&apos;t know50    per cent.42-8 per cent.7-2 per cent.(d) Ministers received an increasing flow of letters, the majority of whichexpressed support for the principle of decimalisation.(e) A motion in support of decimalisation was tabled by Mr. WilfredProudfoot, M.P., in March and has attracted 136 signatures (of which80 are Conservative and 56 Labour).(f) Last February the Federation of British Industries stated that they were impressed with the weight of opinion which favoured the ultimateadoption of a decimal system with its simplification and ultimate saving in the fields of industry, commerce and education. They concurredwith the views expressed in the report of the Joint Committees that theadoption of decimal coinage is an essential first preliminary step towardsany greater use of the metric system of weights and measures.(g) On 24th April, the Chairmen of the British Association and Associationof the British Chambers of Commerce Committees on decimal coinageand the metric system wrote a joint letter to the Financial Times inwhich they said:&quot; On coinage systems, it would appear that the-not unnatural first preliminary reaction in favour of retaining the   as a majorunit is subject to revision on more mature consideration of the salient factors, and that sentiment in support of the   may well give way to the powerful practical arguments in favour of a simpler two, decimal coinage such as the 10s./cent system. Such a change of thought has indeed taken place in the more fully considered and up-to-date view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.&quot;The intention of this note is to discuss tentatively the denominations that mightbe required if it were decided to adopt either a  /cent or a 10s./cent decimalsystem, and to consider the coinage implications of such a decision. For ease ofreference these two systems are set out in tabular form at the end of the note.2. The  /cent system the denominations required would probably be 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents,Icent, \ cent and, unless it had been decided that there were no further need for acoin equivalent to a halfpenny, \ cent. The first three of these would be equivalentexactly to 5s., 2s. and Is. and existing coins of these denominations could remain in circulation. Half crowns and sixpences representing 12-^- and 2\ cents respectivelycould remain in use temporarily, the sixpences perhaps permanently.1 cent, \ cent (and \ cent if needed) would have no exact equivalent in theexisting system, and coins of these denominations would have to be minted; theywould replace threepenny pieces, pennies, and halfpennies of which they would bethe rough equivalents. The numbers required would be approximately, 1 cent-800 millions; \ cent 1,500 millions; \ cent-900 millions.3. The 10s./cent system the denominations required would probably be 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents,5 cents, 1 cent and, unless it had been decided that there were no further need for acoin equivalent to a halfpenny, % cent. The first four of these would be equivalentexactly to 5s., 2s., Is. and 6d. and existing coins of these denominations couldremain in circulation. Halfcrowns and threepenny pieces, representing 25 centsand 2\ cents respectively, could remain in use at least temporarily.APPENDIX note BY THE ROYAL MINT
1 cent (and \ cent if needed) would have no exact equivalent in the existing system and coins of these denominations would have to be minted; they would replace pennies and;halfpennies of which they would be the rough equivalents.The numbers required would be approximately 1 cent-1,500 millions, \ cent 900 millions.4. Specification of the New CoinsExcept for the 25 cents in the  /cent system and the 50 cents in the 10s./centsystem, the coins that correspond exactly in value to existing denominations (i.e.,most of the existing cupro-nickel coins) could be made to the same specificationsas their present counterparts; they would have different reverse designs, probablyshowing their decimal value in figures, and the opportunity might be taken ofsuggesting a new portrait of the Queen on the obverse.The 25 cents in the  /cent system, and the 50 cents in the 10s./cent system,would be the equivalent of the existing crown, which, though suitable forcommemorative purposes, is too large for everyday use. The new coins might with advantage be made of a size between the shilling and the florin (to make themsufficiently distinctive they could be given a relief-lettered inscription on the edgeinstead of milling and be made of silver rather than cupro-nickel).The \ cent and I cent in the  /cent system or the 1 cent and \ cent in the10s./cent system should preferably be made considerably smaller than the penniesand halfpennies they would replace which by modern standards are inconvenientlylarge. The larger of the new coins could be about the size of the halfpenny and thesmaller about the size of the farthing. Both could be bronze, or possibly nickel-brass or another yellow alloy. (Nickel-brass is the material of the current three-penny piece.)The 1 cent piece in the  /cent system, which would replace the threepennypiece, might be a shaped (duo-decagonal or scalloped) nickel-brass coin.5. Required Preparatory period the new 1 cent and \ cent coins, and if the  /cent system were adopted,possibly also J cent coins, would have to be ready for issue immediately the decimalsystem was brought into use. A sufficient preparatory period would therefore berequired to mint denominations which might in the aggregate amount to as many as 3,200 million coins.It would be necessary to establish a branch mint in order to strike the newcoins within a reasonable period. The size of the branch would be determined to suit the time that was available for the operation. No sufficient investigation has yet been undertaken, but it should be possible to complete the new coinage withinthe sort of preparatory period that would be necessary for other purposes (e.g.,conversion of office machinery, education of the public, training of staffs, etc.).Denominations other than the 1 cent, cent and J cent would not need to bestockpiled. Their counterparts in the present system could remain in circulationas long as required, and the new coins would need be issued only to replace worncoins and to meet expansion demand.6. cost the immediate cost of the new [Coinage might be expected to be of the orderof  6 millions to  10 millions depending upon the numbers required. The time available would influence the cost but would not cause it to be of an entirely different order.   : &apos;The ultimate cost would be considerably lower, almost certainly under  millions, largely because there would be a substantial return from the re-use orsale of scrap metal of withdrawn pennies and halfpennies (and in the case of the /cent system, threepenny pieces); and entirely new coins would have replaced coinsthat were already to a greater or less extent due for replacement on account of wear.Also much of the plant purchased for the branch mint could afterwards be utilisedin the Royal Mint and would be necessary re-equipment.The replacement of pennies and halfpennies by less bulky coins (or possibly even the abolition of the halfpenny) might be considered to be a reform that is

-       j APPENDIX  C &apos;     &apos;THE INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS IN ENGLANDAND WALESIncorporated by Royal Charter. 11th May, 1880DECIMALISATION OF THE currency in response to the Government&apos;s request for expressions of view, made bythe Earl of Dundee in the House of Lords on 10th November, 1960, the Councilof the Institute desire to bring to the notice of the Chancellor of the Exchequercertain matters which arise on consideration of the question of the decimalisatioiof the currency.The Principle of Decimalisation1. The advantages of possessing a,decimalised currency are widely known andnot seriously disputed. It has been opposed in the past on the grounds that thecost and dislocation of conversion would outweigh the consequent advantages.There is also a natural reluctance to depart from the traditional and familiar. Buta point has now been reached when the eventual disadvantages of non-decimalisationseem likely to exceed by far the temporary costs and inconvenience of adjustment toa new currency. The last three Commonwealth adherents to the   s. d. system havenow moved so far towards decimalisation that it seems almost certain that by 1965the United Kingdom will be the last significant upholder of that system unless adecision to decimalise has been taken in the meantime. It is wholly inappropriatethat a country which regards itself as an international banker and major progressivecommercial nation should become the sole surviving exponent of a currency systemabandoned by every other commercially advanced nation. In particular, theretention of a non-decimal currency will leave the United Kingdom at an increasingdisadvantage in the use, manufacture and export of financial data processing andother monetary machines during an era of rapid development in this field in europe and throughout the world.2. There is a widespread feeling that decimalisation of the currency is inevitable eventually; the longer it is deferred the greater will be the cost anddislocation. The time has therefore come for a positive move in the direction of reform. Such a positive move could appropriately take the form of a statement by the Government that a decimal currency will be introduced at a specified date which allows a reasonable period of notice of the change. This will ensure that future deliberation will be concerned with the form in which decimal currencyshould be introduced rather than whether the change should take place.Mode of Decimalisation3. Decimalisation is a major change that will profoundly affect the ordinarycitizen&apos;s main means of measurement of values, the coinage. The major cost anddislocation of any change will be borne by those concerned with all kinds of monetary machines, but the major impact will be felt by every member of thepopulation in innumerable daily cash transactions many of them of quite small amount. For this reason it is highly desirable that any system should provide a ready association of value as between the old and the new minor units. TheCouncil consider that the system which best preserves this association is theso-called &quot;10s./cent&quot; system. With a major unit of 10s. this system retainsthe present value of that unit and leaves unaltered the value of all the silver coinage;and the new minor units of cent and half-cent are sufficiently close in value to thepresent penny and halfpenny, although there would be some transitionalcomplication in businesses involving large numbers of small transactions wherethere are price scales based on rises of one penny or other small amounts,; as forexample transport companies, newspaper undertakings and postal services. Hourlywage rates would also have to be expressed in the new currency. These transitionalmatters should, however, be capable of settlement without undue difficulty. the major unit of 10s. has a simple two to one relationship with the present , which renders conversion simple and immediate. The conversion andmaintenance of records under this system would present no undue difficulties.
Moorgate Place,London, E.C. 2.Implications of Abandonment of the  4. There is a natural reluctance to depart from the traditional and familiar , but familiarity is not an adequate reason for retaining an outmoded systemwhen a superior one is available. It has been suggested that the currency would lose status if the   were abandoned. Examination of the  &apos;s experienceover the last 20 years does not suggest, however, that the international standingof the currency is to any marked extent dependent on its traditional associations.A number of designations are available for a new major unit which would fullymaintain the associations and prestige of the existing currency the &quot; sterling &quot;or the &quot; sovereign &quot; for instance. However, although the advantages of traditionand familiarity are unquestionably of value, the Council consider that the nameis less important than the principle and express no preference.Compensation5. The initial cost of conversion to a decimal currency will undoubtedly be heavy and will fall unevenly on different sections of the community, although all will benefit ultimately. Bearing this in mind, the Government may consider thatit would be appropriate to offer compensation on a suitable scale to those affected,either by means of direct grant, along the lines proposed by the South african government, or alternatively by increased taxation allowances, including investmentallowances on purchases of new equipment (including replacement) and the allowance for taxation purposes of costs of conversion of machinery, over-printing and other expenditure consequent upon the change.conclusions.   The Council&apos;s conclusions may be summarised as follows:(a) decimalisation of the currency should be officially adopted in principle and widely announced for introduction at a specified date, being theearliest date consistent with an adequate preparatory period;(b) the most appropriate basis for decimalisation in this country is the&quot; 10s./cent &quot; system with 100 cents equal to the present 10s. and the half-cent as the smallest unit which would be approximately equivalentto the present halfpenny.
