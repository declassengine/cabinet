C. (61) 208 Copy No.   527th December, 1961CABINETDUMPING OF MILK POWDERMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Milk Marketing Boards supported by the milk powder manufacturersapplied to the Board of Trade under the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies)Act, 1957, for duties on imports of milk powder from a number of countries.Under the Act the Board of Trade can impose duties when (a) the goods aredumped and subsidised, (b) the Board are satisfied that the dumping andsubsidisation causes or threatens material injury to a British industry and (c) theduties would be in the national interest.2. I can impose an anti-dumping or countervailing duty only if I am satisfiedon all three counts; a case fails if any one of the requirements is not met and, ofcourse, consideration of whether imposition of duties would be in the national interest the third requirement does not arise unless the first two claims are established.3. I reached the conclusion, after a full and most careful investigation ofthe facts by my officials, that although most of these imports were dumped andin some cases also subsidised they did not cause or threaten material injury to theBritish powder manufacturers or to the British milk producers. Accordingly Idecided that the case must be rejected. The Minister of Agriculture, however,felt some doubts and the matter was referred to the Ministerial Group establishedby the Prime Minister to consider this and two other issues which the Ministerof Agriculture and I wished to put before our colleagues.4. The Group of Ministers accepted that there was no alternative but for meto adhere to my decision to reject the application. The applicants will, therefore,according to the normal procedure, be informed of my decision which will thenbe announced in the Press.5.   I am circulating this paper for the information of my colleagues.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,6th December, 1961.60091Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1961
