THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of....................................................TOP SECRET Copy Mo.I8i10th November^ 1961CABINETy^-OE-^S^JgTJMAS, ISLAND for united STATES NUCJLEAR TESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United States Government have not yet decided to carryout. atmospheric tests.   They have decided to go ahead at once with the preparations but they are not willing to use Eniwetok or Eikini, as theyhave done in the past, on the grounds that these are United NationsTrusteeship territories.   The United States Ambassador has thereforeformally requested the use of facilities, which the Americans wouldconstruct and pay for, on Christmas Island.   I have undertaken to give an early reply.   The Americans would like a combined United States/United Kingdom reconnaissance team to go to Christmas Islandimmediately and they would like to start the construction work about two weeks later.   This work might last about four months.   The teststhemselves, of which 20 to 30 are contemplated, would then bespread over a period of another three to four months,2*     -Technical PointsThe following technical points are relevant:(a) All the tests contemplated would be in the atmosphere,though one or two might be carried out at heights of 150, 000 to300, 000 feet.   Some would be at sea level.   Probably all the testswould be detected by other countries.(b) While the number of tests is large, the Americans tell us thatthe total yield will be not more than ten megatons (roughly a tenth of the yield so far of the current Russian series) and that fall-out shouldcorrespondingly amount to no more than 10 per cent to 15 per cent ofthe fall-out from the Russian tests.(c) The Americans have explained that testing is necessary mainly to improve yield to weight ratio, in order to accommodate protectiondevices and to develop counter-measures and even counter counter-measures, which are now becoming technically feasible.3.      General Points(a)    The Americans appear to contemplate that other series of tests might follow on an annual basis (but presumably only if no agreement on a nuclear tests treaty is reached).     They are willingto give us full information derived from the tests.
(b) Mr. Khrushchev has stated that if the Americans now testin the atmosphere the Russians will continue to do so.   He may, ofcourse, do so anyway.(c) Australia and New Zealand will have a special interest becausethe tests will be in the Southern hemisphere.4.      Advantages of agreeing to the United States proposalWe fully supported the American decision in September to resume testing, and we have now said that, if we are convinced thata particular atmospheric test is necessary in order to maintainthe balance of the deterrent and to preserve freedom in the world, wewould be bound either to co-operate in or support it e conduct.   the americans are in a real difficulty over testing grounds and we arein a position to give or withhold something that they badly need.   Weshould therefore be able to induce the Americans to adopt a policy of full collaboration over testing.   We should also be able to take advantage in other contexts of the political good-will earned by acceding to their request.5 *      D i s a d vant a g e by acceding to the American request v/e expose ourselves to serious criticism.   Once construction work is started at christmas island, this will soon become public knowledge.   For the following three to four months, and thereafter during a similar period whiletests are carried out, we shall be under pressure to call a halt tothe programme.   This will come not only from uncommitted countries and the United Nations but also from India and probably, Canada, andother Commonwealth countries, as well as Japan.   There will no doubt be strong protests in the United Kingdom, where both our own statements in Parliament and the recent statement of President Kennedy havebeen widely regarded as meaning that if any atmospheric tests takeplace the number will be very small.6.      P,qnclu s ion s iFrom the Foreign Office and defence point of view thebalance of advantage lies in acceding to the American request, but onlyon very strict and precise conditions, which we can justify to them onthe grounds of the severe criticism to which we shall be subjected.We must be satisfied that tests should be carried out only on the strictest criteria of military necessity;  and we can only be satisfiedabout this on the basis of full scientific information (including designinformation) about the devices to be tested.   These conditions shouldbe applied to each individual test.   We must also have such information about testing arrangements as we need to satisfy ourselves on the health and safety aspects.   In particular, we require more information about any tea ts that might contaminate Christmas Island or theadjacent seas. .-2-
7.     In the meantime, I recommend that:-(a) Officials should urgently study what further conditions wemay want to impose and how our conditions should be formulated for presentation to the Americans.(b) When we are ready to inform the Americans that we agree inprinciple to their request and to explain our conditions, we shouldalso make it clear that we must discuss with them how their testsprogramme should best be presented in order to mitigate the severe criticism likely to arise.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1.10th November, 1961
