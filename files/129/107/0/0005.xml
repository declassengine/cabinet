CONFIDENTSAL\ act ten75(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE:   THE DRUG bill memorandum by the Minister of HealthThis memorandum is circulated at the Prime Minister&apos;s request for the information of members of the Cabinet.2,     About a year ago, various hospital authorities started purchasingcertain patented drugs from unlicensed sources at prices greatly below those charged by the patentees.     This was probably a contravention ofthe Patents Acts, and was in any case unfair to the patentees;   on theother hand, the prima facie evidence that the patentees&apos; prices wereexcessive could not be ignored.3.      The Home Affairs Committee therefore approved at their meetingon 12th May, 1961, the proposal of the Health Ministers to invite tendersfrom British manufacturers and from importers for the supply of certainpatented drugs to the hospital service under central contract termsindemnifying the contractors against royalties.    Contracts have nowbeen placed accordingly.4.      All the contractors are British companies but none is a patenteeor licensee.     Most of the imported drugs will come from a reputablemanufacturer in Italy;  one drug will be obtained from a manufacturer in denmark using raw material from Poland.    In both cases, visits of inspection have been paid to the manufacturers and there is no doubt thatthe drugs to be supplied will be of high quality conforming in all respectsto British standards.     Tests will be maintained throughout the duration of the contracts.5.      Royalties are payable, which will be agreed with the patentees ordetermined by tbe courts;  but the contract prices are so far below thosecharged by patentees that very large savings will certainly remain afterany likely royalties have been paid.    For example, on one drug, which represents nearly one-half of the total by value, the contract pricewas roughly two-fifths of that asked by the patentee.     The total valueof the contracts, based on the latest available consumption figures, isabout  400,000 and the savings apart from royalties are estimated at about  jr million.6. The contracts are for one year only in the first instance, and theposition will be reviewed next -year. It is possible that the action takenmay result in a reduction in prices by the patentees themselves, who areC. (61) 1556th October, 196lCABINET-1-
all United States companies.    Section 46 of the Patents Act, 1949. doesnot enable similar action to be taken in purchasing drugs for thePharmaceutical Services (supply by chemists on doctors&apos; prescriptions);but any price reductions by the patentees would also apply to thePharmaceutical Services, where greater savings still would result.7.     Pfizers Inc. are challenging in the Courts the use of Section 46for hospital purchases.    A Statement of Claim has just been received and is being studied.J. E.
