Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 2118th December, 1961CABINETAGRICULTURAL SUPPORT policy memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the TreasuryIt is unavoidable that we must ask Parliament for a Supplementary Voteamounting to close on  76 millions for the implementation of the price guaranteesto agriculture (including Scotland) in the current year. The sum is so large thatpresentation of this Estimate cannot await the spring Supplementaries. Indeed,in view of the way the price guarantees work, we cannot be sure that we may not require still more money in the spring.2. This will come as a shock to the public. It is also going to make mattersso difficult for us in framing the Estimates for next year that I have had to treatit as one of my first tasks at the Treasury to look afresh at our farm subsidy policy,and to consider where it is in fact leading us at such an embarrassing rate.3. The Cabinet are already aware that the cost of Exchequer support for agriculture has been increasing in recent years. The costs, including Scotland,are as follows:	Price	Production	Administration		guarantees	grants	costs	Total*		  millions		1958-59 Actual.........	154-7	81-0	4-8	240-51959-60 Actual ...	154-8	95-1	5-9	255-81960-61 Actual.........	151-2	104-5	6-1	261-81961-62 Estimates Provision   ...	159-4	106-3	6-2	271-91961-62 End-November Forecast	234-6	107-5	6-2	348-3* These totals exclude an average of  1 million a year paid in grant to Northern Ireland underClass VIII, Vote 2.4. The reasons for this growth in expenditure are not in dispute. The pricesubsidies are (with certain exceptions) open-ended guarantees. If productionincreases or the market price falls or both these things happen, the Exchequer paysout more. After the date when the provision in this year&apos;s Estimates ( 272 millions)was fixed, a further  7 millions was added by the increases in the guarantees agreedto at the 1961 Annual Review of farm prices. Since then, on the latest estimates,increases in production have added  9 millions and, despite some compensatingfall in the cost of feeding stuffs, a sharp drop in market prices (due to pressure from increased home production as well as to imports), mainly of fatstock and bacon,has added  60 millions: All these add up to over  348 millions of expenditure in1961-62, as against  262 millions in 1960-61, an increase of  68 millions in one year.5. These are not final estimates, but they are the best that can be made atpresent, and there is unfortunately no reason to think that they exaggerate the seriousness of the outlook.  Only an unexpectedly strong recovery in market pricesCopy No.SI60101
2 Sl2Cl*E&quot;Fbetween now and the end of March could even partly restore the position. Th^need for large Supplementary Votes will remain, and with it the painful lesso^Pwhich has been brought home to us. This is that in our farm price support arrangements we have tied our hands; and that, while this continues to be so,economic and political pressure will lead to increasing and possibly acceleratingdemands upon the Exchequer which, to be honest, we shall be unable to control.Aijjiour total financial resources are limited, this is terribly unfair to all the restof the field of Government expenditure, where control is practicable, but verypainful.6. This dismaying financial picture leads one to look at the economic position which lies beneath. In the first place, as regards the production of farmcommodities, the trend has been steadily upward. At the last farm price review,production stood over 70 per cent, above pre-war; indeed, in each recent year ithas been rising. Technical progress and Government support have both contributed to this result, and of course the technical revolution on the farms is still continuing.The point must come therefore I believe it has been reached now when weare forced to consider whether it is in the general interest, to carry on with asupport system which appears to encourage an ever-increasing output of farm products at a constantly rising cost in public subventions, without regard to thefinancial and economic consequences.7. In the second place, despite the increase in production and the growth of the subsidies, net farm income is not rising. Departmental calculations suggestthat it has remained more or less static during the past four years at around 360-370 millions, after adjusting the figures to normal weather conditions. on another calculation, which the farmers prefer to use, net income has actually been falling in the last few years. The position varies, of course, between different kinds of farming. Technical change and generous subsidies have improved the incomes of the cereal growers and the fatstock producers. But support prices for milk, eggs and potatoes have stimulated output at uneconomic cost for fallingreturns, with the result that net income earned by farmers in these particular lineshas gone down. This is an absurd situation. But nothing is at present being done to remedy it, and indeed the farmers themselves have rejected recent proposals that milk production should be limited. Our present system offers the individualfarmer a positive inducement to seek a way out of this dilemma which makes thesituation of farmers as a whole worse.8. Thirdly, it is disappointing that the social benefits of our Exchequer grants and subsidies are so unevenly spread. While the total outlay of public money on these subventions is rising steadily, it is the larger scale farmers who mainlybenefit. It has been found that the larger the farm, the greater the proportion ofits net income which comes direct from the Government. In some cases the farm&apos;sentire net income is subsidy. This is not what we intended when we first evolvedour policy.The Operation of the Long-term Assurances to Agriculture, - .9. The Annual Review of farm prices is a duty laid upon Ministers by the agriculture Act of 1947. From that year on, it involved the Government in anannual haggle. When we negotiated the long-term assurances to agriculture in1956 we hoped that this &quot; bargaining &quot; process would thenceforth feature lessprominently in the Annual Review. But financially what the Government in factachieved by their long-term assurances was to surrender much of their freedom ofaction. We are how compelled, by the Act of 1957 which embodied these assurances, to follow a procedure by which we in effect start an annual negotiation with the farmers by conceding an addition to the guarantees equal to the whole oftheir increased costs, and then impose a strictly limited cut in subsidies in theteeth of bitter opposition.&apos; 10. The amount by which the guarantees can be cut after any Price Review is strictly limited, because, in order to give practical effect to our long-term assurances,the Agriculture Act set clear arithmetical limits. Thus the Review first determinesthe aggregate value of the guarantees, by assessing the current rate of output ofReview commodities at the guarantee price prevailing since the last Review. Atthe 1961 Review this aggregate value was  1,279 millions; it may now be rather higher.  On a minimum determination this can be reduced the following year by
2&amp; pei cent. ( 33 millions), unless in the meantime farm costs have risen. Any riseIP costs (such as the recent Farm Wage award) has to be added back andautomatically reduces the size of the permissible cut.   .11. In 1960 we imposed a cut of  9 millions (although  19 millions waspermissible) in a total subsidy bill of  260 millions. In 1961,. following thediscussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions in the latter half of 1960, we yielded to pressure and actually increased the guarantees by  14 millions, although we shouldhave been amply justified in imposing the maximum cut permitted by the Act&quot;.Indeed we went further and gave fresh assurances in regard to changes in certainguaranteed prices at the next Annual Review-assurances we must now honour.I think we had the worst of all worlds, and we are to-day further than ever fromachieving a pattern of support for agriculture which is financially tolerable as wellas socially and economically viable.Farm Subsidies and the Future Level of Public Expenditure12. I return to the central problem mentioned at the beginning of this paper.The farm subsidies are open-ended guarantees which leave the Government no control whatever over the actual level of expenditure. The manner in which theyhave worked out this year (and, I am afraid, seem likely to do in 1962-63) make sit extraordinarily hard to plan public expenditure next year in such a way as tocarry out the pledge given by the Chancellor with the authority of the Cabinet to limit the overall increase to 2.\ per cent., unless unconscionable cuts are to be&apos;made in other services.13. Looking further ahead, we must ask ourselves whether, if theseopen-ended commitments continue, we can accept the kind of demand which theyare this year making and may again make on the Exchequer, while at the sametime we painfully enforce long-range plans for containing the growth of expenditurein other fields where our commitment is not open-ended.The Common Market14. It can be said that if Britain enters the Common Market the burden ofthe farm subsidies on the Exchequer will begin to diminish, and that the cost willpartly be transferred to the consumer as the common external tariff is established and the transition to a common agricultural policy with the rest of the Communitytakes place. This may well be true, but the process will take a long time. the six have not yet evolved their own common policy on agriculture, and in any eventI understand we are thinking in terms of a transitional stage lasting from 10-15!years. Our own problem confronts us immediately. Our undertakings to restrainpublic expenditure have to be implemented now, or we risk failure in the eyes ofour supporters and the country at large (and the foreign bankers).The Production Grants and the Farm Improvement Scheme15. So far in this paper I have directed attention to the open-ended price guarantees. While it is these guarantees which at present use up a greater proportionof the money and this year are entailing large Supplementary Estimates, over 100 millions a year is now required for the Production Grants. This requirementhas itself risen by 40 per cent: during the past five years. Thave the strongimpression that many of these grants, which were evolved during the period immediately following the war and have been continued or modified in a piecemealfashion, have in recent years combined with the price guarantees to encourage further increased output where this was not wholly desirable in the&apos;general interest, andhave in fact enlarged the ultimate demand on the Exchequer instead of relieving itas they were intended to do. In many respects the grants no&apos; longer form a coherentpattern of support; I feel that the time may well have come to overhaul them.16. In this connexion it happens that a decision is required urgently on thefuture of (a) the Farm Improvement Scheme and (b) the Hill Farming and LivestockRearing Scheme both of which look like running Out of funds. The farm improvement Scheme started with the Agriculture Act of 1957, which authorisedgrants aipthe rate of 33^ per cent, over a period of 10 years subject to a limit of 50 millions (which can be increased by Order to  55 millions). I understandfromthe Minister of Agriculture that after only four years nearly  40 millions of themoney is already committed, and he thinks that there may be a run on the balance
as soon as it is realised that funds are giving out. He therefore would likj^to legislate to increase the  55 millions limit substantially, in order that the Scherjpmay run on for the full term of 10 years. For the past two years the Treasury haveopposed this suggestion, and indeed I find that in 1957 the then Minister ofAgriculture told Parliament that he could not undertake for 10 years not to limitexpenditure on these grants, and that if it seemed likely to exceed  55 millions thematter would have to be looked at afresh. He reminded the Cabinet of this inJuly 1960.17. My recommendation is that in present circumstances the proper course is to reduce the rate of grant from S3+ per cent, to a substantially lower figure. Thiswould require an amendment to the Act. It would give us time to consider more closely up to what point the investment of public funds in farm improvements along the lines of the present Scheme should be allowed to continue, bearing in mind otherclaimants.18. As regards the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Schemes, where theprovision of the  27 millions made available under the Acts of 1946-59 is now fullycommitted I am firmly opposed to any extension. Six years ago an extension ofthe Scheme from 1961 to 1963 was only agreed because the then Minister ofAgriculture told the then Financial Secretary, Treasury (myself), that this two-yearextension was necessary to enable him to finish the job, and that no further moneybeyond the  27 millions would be required. I may add that, since then, theTreasury have repeatedly pressed the Ministry of Agriculture for a full assessment of the worth-whileness of the Scheme; this has never been carried out, but theevidence suggests that there is no economic justification for continuing it.Conclusions19.   The following conclusions seem to me to be inescapable:(i) the manner in which the Governmenfs long-term assurances to agriculturehave been implemented within the framework of the Agriculture Actshas dangerously exposed the Budget, in a way that is most embarrassingin relation to the Governmenfs pledge to Parliament to containwithin 2J per cent, the rate of growth in public expenditure;(ii) public opinion will be shocked by the size of the Supplementary Estimatewhich must be presented at an early date for the agricultural grants and subsidies, and that will be the moment for the Government tomake their position clear;(iii) the Government, as a step towards retrieving a dangerous situation, should announce that they will not allow the cost of the grants and subsidiesin 1962-63 and thereafter to exceed a stated maximum figure( 300 millions would be a 10 per cent, increase on the original estimate for 1961-62);(iv) we must make, up our minds now, even if we do not say so in advance,that the 1962 Annual Review next February must be a tough one,leading to a minimum determination;(v) it is possible that the Annual Review may, even on a minimumdetermination, call for provision in excess of our stated maximum;we should, therefore, forthwith initiate studies of new measures thatmay be required, whether within or outside the ambit of the agriculture act, to honour our long-term assurances to the farmers without increasing the Exchequer liability beyond the maximum we have decided upon;(vi) no further financial provision should be made for the continuation of the farm Improvement Scheme, but in view of the rapid commitment ofthe remaining funds the Act should be amended at once to reducesubstantially the present rate of grant;(vii) in view of the full commitment of all the funds at present authorised forthe Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Schemes, no further commitments under these Schemes should be accepted from now on.H.
