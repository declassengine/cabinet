Printed for the Cabinet. November 1.961C. (61) 181 . Copy No.   5 08th November, 1961CABINETTRADE WITH POLANDMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn the summer my colleagues considered in the Economic Policy Committeeand in the Cabinet a proposal by my predecessor to increase the quotas for importsof Polish bacon and canned ham for six or seven years in return for the sale of british ships and heavy vehicles to Poland (C.C. (61) 46th Conclusions, Minute 7). TheMinister of Agriculture objected to guarantees being given for a period of years butagreed that the increases proposed could be given for the current quota year only.The Cabinet supported this view and the proposal was dropped. The Poles were accordingly asked whether, in return for the bacon and canned ham quotas being increased for the current quota year only, they would consider buying British aircraft which the Minister of Aviation was most anxious they should do.2. An important result of the recent visit of two senior Polish Ministers to theUnited Kingdom is that they have offered definitely to buy a viable fleet of british aircraft immediately. This would cost  If millions, probably more, and no creditwould be involved. In return we would be expected to increase the quotas for imports from Poland in the current quota year by about  1-J- millions, this figure toinclude bacon, canned ham and other canned meat. This proposal is made by thePoles in the knowledge that no undertakings can be given about the levels of thesequotas in future years and that the balance of at least    million will have to befound out of their other resources.3. In detail the figure of about  1^ millions would be made up by increasingthe quotas as follows:Increase SuggestedQuantity ValueTons  Bacon ............      4,000 950,000Canned ham............        - 200,000Canned poultry     .........        - 100,000Other canned meat (of which 50 percent, pigmeat)     .........        - 200,0004. As regards bacon, the Minister of Agriculture offered my predecessora maximum increase of 4,000 tons last summer on terms which he could not acceptat the time. Agreement was, however, reached to an increase of 3,000 tons for oneyear and this was later confirmed in the Economic Policy Committee and in Cabinet.The figure of 3,000 tons was then mentioned to the Poles in the context of a dealon aircraft (paragraph 1 above), and this offer remains open. I appreciate the anxietyof the Minister of Agriculture about the present weakness of the bacon market.However, the situation has not been due to any increase in Polish supplies, which are limited by quota. Moreover, an increase of 4,000 tons in the Polish bacon quota for one year would be negligible in relation to the market of nearly 600,000 tons ayear in which uncontrolled fluctuations are of a much larger order.  Indeed, I amTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT59955
informed that the effect of such a quota increase on actual supplies in the quota year would be to increase them by only 1,200 tons above the current quota of 48,500 tons.(This arises from the fact that the Poles &quot; borrowed &quot; 2,800 tons of the current quotaat the end of the last quota year.)5.  The Minister of Agriculture has already agreed to the increases proposed for canned ham and for canned poultry.  These also are marginal and negligible in^relation to the market.  The increase proposed for &quot; other canned meat (including&apos;^50&apos;per cent, of canned pigmeat) &quot; is a new item but is also so small that it should notdisturb the market.6. On the other hand, a sale of British aircraft to Poland to equip their nationalairlines will represent a major break-through of the greatest political and technicalimportance. It will encourage other Communist countries, such as China and czechoslovakia, which are already interested in buying a much larger number of aircraft from us and will also enhance the prestige of our aircraft generally. If wecan get this business it will also put us in a strong position to supply aircraft forfurther expansion of the Polish airlines which is being planned to include anew trans-Atlantic route.7. I believe that we cannot afford to lose this unique opportunity and I ask my colleagues to give their approval to the quota increases set out in paragraph above for the quota year 1961-62 in return for the immediate sale of British aircraft to Poland to a value not less than  If millions.F. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,7th November, 1961.
