Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 21818th December, 1961Copy No.    6 0CABINETCIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT, 1965-64 TO 1965-66Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general  am circulating to the Cabinet herewith the report proposed by officials on public investment in the years 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66, which was discussed by the Economic Policy Committee on 9th November. The figure for expenditurein 1962-63, at  1,855 millions, differs from the figure of  1,840 millions printed inthe White Paper (Cmnd. 1522, published in October) in that it includes additions to the programmes for gas (methane, etc., which we agreed) and for electricity(to provide for growing demand).2. Decisions are becoming urgent, mainly for those Departments which haveto approve at this time the capital expenditure programmes of outside authorities for the year beginning 1st April, 1963.3. At the discussion in the Economic Policy Committee on 9th NovemberI emphasised that, on present Departmental plans, the aggregate of public investmentwas running ahead much faster than we should be able to afford. It was suggestedin the discussion that, in reviewing the proposed expenditures, the main criteriato be adopted might be the extent to which (i) they were likely to generate anincrease in public current expenditure, and (ii) they would be economicallyproductive.4. It was argued on the one side that the expansions of public capitalexpenditure were required in the public interest, and indeed for the healthy growth of the economy, and that they should be carried out even if somewhat highertaxation would result. On the other side it was argued that, if these programmes were allowed to expand as proposed, the additional load (both the capitalexpenditure and the resulting acceleration of current expenditure) would reducethe margin available for private investment and particularly for exports, and thatthis was bound to damage the health and growth of the economy.5. It is, I think, accepted that the nationalised industries&apos; investment must becarried out. We must have the power, transport and communications to meet theneeds of a growing economy. The link between public service investment andeconomic growth is generally less close. A close link can of course be argued forthe road programme: the development of services such as education and health should have a long-term effect upon national productivity, but investment decisionsnow being taken in those fields can hardly be expected to have much effect on this in the next decade: many of the other services have a remoter relationship witheconomic growth.6. I do not question that all these programmes are highly desirable. But our major problem is to get through the next five years without a further set of economiccrises or disasters. A swiftly expanding public service investment programme whichwould carry with it accelerating public current expenditure and further increases in taxation will assuredly not help us to evade them.
7. I attach at Annex A a table derived from Appendix B of the attachtHPreport by officials (Annex B). It shows that these public service capital expenditures,for the average of 1963-64 to 1965-66, would on present plans be 19 per cent, abovethe present (1961-62) level. We must note also that the officials (paragraphs 3 and 8)say that the figures may misleadingly under-estimate the prospective growth ofsome programmes., . 8. I have expressed the view that we could without disaster accept an increaseioj, say, 10 to 15 per cent, over the period. An average increase of 13, per, cent,would necessitate a reduction of  50 millions a year on average in presentDepartmental plans.9. This is the context (apart altogether from the effect on current expenditure)in which I have felt obliged to propose that there should be no further increase inthe Ministry of Education^ already high rate of investment. I know we must provide large resources for University expansion. Roads and hospitals unlikeschools and houses have lagged behind in the post-war years; we agreed and announced in August a firm five-year road programme, a long way below whatthe Minister of Transport believed was needed, and in a few weeks&apos; time theMinister of Health will be publishing the agreed hospital building plans. TheMinister of Housing, as I know very well, is under great pressure to provide more for housing. Of course we shall need with good judgment to trim all round if weare going to keep this total growth of capital expenditure to a rate of increase thatwe can manage. But I must seriously ask my colleagues to look at these figures as a whole, to weigh the priorities, and to see whether they can arrive at any otherconclusion than that which I have reached.10. I cannot see any escape by reducing public current expenditure to make room for the increased capital expenditure. Where there are both kinds ofexpenditure, it is much easier to check the growth of capital rather than currentspending. One cannot see easy savings in defence, oversea aid, pensions,subsidies, &amp;c, which can be brought in to keep the account straight. If in thesecircumstances my colleagues say that we must let public expenditure grow, and let the taxes go up as necessary to pay for it, and take the resources from private investment and exports in the process, I am bound to reply that there is no escapethat way either. All that I have proposed, in agriculture, investment and everythingelse, is what is needed to begin to give us a chance of getting away from the treadmillof desperate Estimates seasons and frustrating Budgets and agonising reappraisalsthat has been the regular process for so long. Without what I am suggesting, i cannot see any possibility of bringing our affairs into order and having a sensibleand practical long-term plan for the development of public expenditure and thepublic sector as a whole, within our prospective resources. And if we act stronglyand succeed, the rewards right across the whole field are so great.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.14 th December, 1961.CONPID/EtfplAL

.....        annex BCIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT, 1963-64 TO 1965-66In July Ministers approved figures for expenditure on civil public investment in1962-63 (C.C. (61) 41st Conclusions); and these will be published in this year&apos;white Paper on 31st October. Because of the extent to which investment expenditure is committed well in advance, there is now a pressing need for ministers to take provisional decisions (subject to short-term changes in the economicsituation) both on expenditure on each item for 1963-64 and on the expenditure on nationalised industries&apos; and public service investment in 1964-65 and 1965-66. Ifprovisional decisions are further delayed the operation of executive agencies, e.g.,local authorities or boards, will be seriously hampered.2. Appendix A shows, for the investment programmes of the nationalised industries and public corporations, the approved figures for 1961-62 and 1962-63and the proposed figures for 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66, together with somedescriptive notes. Appendix B does the same for public service capital expenditure.The position may be summarised as follows:  millions (rounded).	1961-62	1962-63	1963-64	1964-65	1965-66Nationalised industries.........	880	930	985	1,005	1,010Public service capital expenditure	870	925	1,015	1,035	1,060Total investment )    ......	1,750	1,855	2,000	2,040	2,065(x) Because of rounding the total for 1965-66 does not equal the sum of the two sub-totals.Of these totals nearly 55 per cent, represents building and civil engineering work,about 33 per cent, plant and machinery and about 8 per cent, vehicles, ships and aircraft. The remainder is for purchases of land, leases and existing buildings.These proportions do not vary significantly over the period.3. These proposals have been subjected to close examination. In some ofthe nationalised industries, they may be affected by new developments or byenquiries now in progress. The figures for these industries, therefore, cannot yet be regarded as final. Nevertheless, it is clear that, for the two categories of public investment taken together, the figures represent without serious exaggeration thecost of implementing present Departmental policies. In so large an aggregatethere are bound to be some variations upwards or downwards, but it is reasonablycertain that no significant reductions can be made in the totals for 1963-64 and later years without changes in the policies which Departments are seeking to carryout. This applies with as much force to the smaller programmes (covering manyminor services which can no longer be postponed) as to the larger. It would,moreover, be imprudent to attach too much importance to the fact that the ratesof increase in the total, which rises steeply to 1963-64, tend to flatten out thereafter.This is a common feature of these exercises, which we have named the &quot; falsesummit &quot;; it occurs because of the difficulty of forecasting more than two or threeyears ahead and the general tendency of Departments and authorities to under-provide for new commitments in the later years.4. The figures in paragraph 2 above show the total claims on resources whichwould be made by civil public investment if the Departments&apos; &quot;bids&quot; were accepted. It would be helpful if we could show comparable figures for private investment, both because of their relevance to some of the public programmes(notably those of the nationalised industries) and in order to provide an assessment
( total fixed investment. No rational forecast can be made of the level of private investment as far ahead as 1963-64 but it is essential that adequate room be left for this, especially for investment in manufacturing and other productive activitieson which so much depends. In addition it is particularly important in presentcircumstances that public investment, like other kinds of public expenditure, shouldnot contribute to the general overloading of resources at home which is so damaging to the balance of payments, and thus frustrating to our economic growth.Nationalised Industries and Public Corporations5. As indicated,in Appendix A, many of the figures of future expenditure onthese programmes are subject to possible revision; they are, however, the bestfigures available and for the present must therefore be adopted for the purposesof the exercise. It will be seen that total expenditure on these programmes isexpected, on the basis of the Departments&apos; figures, to rise from  930 millions in1962-63 to  985 millions in 1963-64, and then, less steeply, to  1,010 millions in1965-66.6. Although the investment expenditure of the nationalised industries is growing, the implementation of the policy set out in Cmnd. 1337 (&quot; The Financialand Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries &quot;) should contain their demands on the Exchequer and in some cases reduce them. For example, theMinister of Power expects shortly to agree with the gas and electricity industriestargets which, if achieved, seem likely to result in Exchequer borrowings by theelectricity industry rising above their present level by only about  20 millions in1963-64 and 1964-65, and falling thereafter to the present level or even below it.On the same assumption, the gas industry seems likely to be a net repayer of exchequer advances from 1964 onwards.7. The proposals of the nationalised industries must be judged by the criteriaestablished in the examination of the figures for 1962-63 (and to be quoted in thisyear&apos;s White Paper), namely, the need to provide essential supplies and services,and the contribution towards the required standard of financial performance.There are, however, some parts of this field where marginal differences in the size and direction of the investment have political significance. Rural electrificationand the length of the telephone waiting list are clearly examples of this. political decisions will be required from Ministers on these points.Public Service Capital expenditure. Appendix B shows that, on the basis of Departments&apos; bids, public servicecapital expenditure would increase from the approved level of  925 millions in1962-63 to  1,015 millions in 1963-64 a rise of 11 per cent. The figures for the subsequent years suggest that the rate of increase will fall off markedly; but forthe reasons given in paragraph 3 above, this may well be misleading. Certainlyin some of the programmes there are strong continuing tendencies towardsexpansion.9. If it is decided that the prospective increase in public service capitalexpenditure after 1962-63 is too great, and that the totals must be reduced, it willbe necessary to look for policy changes. In this process all the programmes willhave to come under review; but it is doubtful whether any sizeable impression canbe made on the figures without changes in the two largest programmes in this group, viz., housing and education.10. Housing in England and Wales shows a big increase between 1962-63and 1963-64 because the figures assume a return from the level of 100,000 startsin 1962 to 110,000 in 1963, as well as a speed-up of work in progress. this programme is of special importance not only because of its size. Housing, moreperhaps than any other type of investment, has a consequential effect on other types; and a reduction in public sector housing (unless offset by an increase in theprivate sector) should help to reduce the demand for investment in water and sewerage, electricity, telephones, &amp;c.11. The figures for education have already been reduced as a result of ministerial decisions in July; but the education building programme for Englandand Wales remains a very large one, and one which in considerable measuregenerates continuing current expenditure.   (The expansion of the number of
teacher training places, for example, gives rise to more buildings to be maintain^^and more staff to teach in them: but its purpose is to produce more teachers, andthus an increase Of current expenditure.)Effect 00 Construction Industries12. The Ministry of Works take the view that, as far as they can judge atpresent, the estimated construction element in the increase in total expenditure on civil public investment from  1,855 millions, in 1962-63 to  2,000 millions in1963-64 should be within the capacity of the building and civil engineering industries. An increase in the labour force occurred during the first half of 1961,contrary to expectations; there was also some increase in output per man. Thiscomparatively reassuring view does not depend on an assumption of a really seriousdown-turn in private building during this period.Comparison with Propective Economic Resources13. The projections in the aggregate represent a claim on economic resources which cannot be at all readily accommodated within the Governmenfs policy of keeping the growth of total public expenditure within the prospective growth of resources. The report on &quot; Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to1965-66 &quot;, which showed the implications of containing public expenditure withina ratio of 42-5 per cent, of Gross National Product (G.N.P.), envisaged a figureof  1,950 millions for public investment in 1965-66 (at the prices of the first quarterof 1961). But this figure and the other restraints proposed in the report were inadequate to bring expenditure by 1965-66 within the prescribed level of 42-5 percent, of G.N.P. and decisions have not yet been taken on the other proposals,notably on defence and education current expenditure. Yet the Departmental bidsconsidered in the present paper envisage expenditure on public investment in1963-64 of  2,000 millions. (The price basis is nominally the same as that of thereport quoted above, i.e., the first quarter of 1961; there may be in the figures some slight element in respect of subsequent price changes, but this is not thought tobe significant.)14. This comparison suggests that the proposed level of expenditure in1963-64 -and in subsequent years is running ahead of prospective economic resources; and there is a further consideration. The work in the Public expenditure survey Committee earlier this year demonstrated the extent to which capitalexpenditure on the public services tends to generate current expenditure and thus to make even more difficult the Governmenfs aim of keeping the growth ofexpenditure within that of resources. Paragraph 127 of the report referred to inthe previous paragraph said: &quot; It is likely . . . that over much of the field the most effective means of moderating the growth of current expenditure is to reduce andpostpone the expansion of facilities by public investment&quot;.Flexibility15. In planning public investment, it is necessary to provide for the possibilityof short-term variations in the rate of implementation of the programmes should theeconomic situation require these. The scope for variations of this kind (if they arenot to have damaging consequences) is not large, and it is some months before their full effect is felt; but it is essential that there should be some element of &quot; flexibility &quot;of this kind. Last year, within the figures provisionally approved for 1962-63,margins were fixed for most of the major programmes; and pending this year&apos;sReview Departments were allowed to enter into commitments only up to the&quot; minimum &quot; level (i.e., the provisionally agreed figure minus the margin). Thissystem made it easier in July of this year to moderate the growth of expenditure, as required by the economic situation, without uneconomic interference with theprogress of public investment.16. The figures for 1963-64 and later years shown in Appendices A and Brepresent the &quot; normal &quot; programmes of the Departments and authorities as they see them at present. In the light of the considerations outlined in paragraphs 13 and14 above it may be necessary to reduce some at least of these. But whatever thefigures eventually agreed, provisional approval by Ministers to figures for 1963-64would imply that, for the time being, expenditure for .1963-64 should be committedonly up to 95 per cent, of the figures approved, except in special cases where the
%,easury and the Department concerned agreed that a margin of this kind wasinappropriate. Similarly, provisional approval by Ministers to total figures for1964-65 and 1965-66 would enable the Treasury and the Departments to agree,where necessary, on the levels to which expenditure might be committed within the&quot;normal &quot;programme figures. The 1962 Investment Review would then providethe opportunity next summer to consider whether, in the light of economic prospectsat that time, the projected rate of expenditure in 1963-64 should be modified in eitherdirection.17.   It is proposed, therefore, that :(a) the proposals of the nationalised industries should be judged by the considerations quoted in paragraph 7;(b) the views of Ministers should be sought on the attitude to be adopted towards the proposed levels of public service capital expenditure in1963-64 and subsequent years, with special reference to the need to contain the growth of total public expenditure within the growth of resources.27 th October, 1961.

These changes areexplained in the notes below.0 These figures represent Departments&apos; proposals for the &quot; normal&quot; level of expenditure upon their programmes. Ministers&apos; provisional approval of these (or amended) figures would giveDepartments authority to commit up to 95 per cent, of the provisionally approved level but not to go beyond that without the specific agreement of the Treasury.(3) The figures put forward by the British Transport Commission are for calendar years but canbe put on a financial year basis without adjustment since the programme is running at an even level.National Coal BoardThese are provisional figures; final figures will not be available until completionof the current review of the future activities of the Coal Board.Gas CouncilThese figures include the expenditure required for the methane project, whichhas just been approved by Ministers, and for other possible projects. In the longterm expenditure is expected to stabilise at.around  50 millions.Electricity Council and Boards England and WalesThese figures make allowances for proposed additional investment spread overthe years 1962-63 1965-66, to meet the latest estimates of demand. The effectof these estimates is still being studied.South of Scotland Electricity BoardThese figures are the result of discussions between the Treasury and theScottish Home Department and represent reductions from the original estimates.
October 1961.Dbrth of Scotland Hydro-Electricity BoardThese are provisional figures; final figures depend upon the report of theMackenzie Committee on the future organisation of electricity supply in Scotland.British European AirwaysThese figures reflect a substantial phasing back, in the interests of realism,of British European Airway&apos;s own forecasts of investment in aircraft.British Overseas Airways CorporationAllowance is made for a rephasing of payments for V.C.10 aircraft into thelast two years of the period. This is under discussion by the Treasury and Ministryof Aviation.British Transport CommissionThese are provisional figures: the programme will have to be determined inthe light of decisions taken after completion of the Commission^ current reviews of future traffic; firm figures will probably be available in about a year&apos;s time.The figures now shown include provision for the Victoria line tube, not yetapproved by Ministers.Atomic Energy AuthorityThese figures are consistent with the Authority&apos;s five-year forecasts.Post office the figure of  136 millions for 1963-64 includes a provisional estimate by thePost Office of the investment needed to accommodate the growth of demand for new telephones and to reduce the waiting list to what they would regard as acceptable proportions. Final estimates for this and later years will not beavailable for some months. Approval of a figure of  130 millions for committalsin 1963-64 will be adequate for the Post Office&apos;s immediate purposes.Other Public CorporationsThese figures cover investment by the British Broadcasting Corporation, theIndependent Television Authority and the Covent Garden Market Authority.

Ministries&apos; provisional approval of these (or amended) figures would giveDepartments authority to commit up to 95 per cent, of the provisionally approved level but not to go beyond that without the specific agreement of the Treasury.Ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentHousingThe Minister of Housing agreed in July to limit starts in 1962 to 100,000(including housing associations and new towns). The figures for expenditure in1963-64 onwards assume a return in 1963 to an inclusive total of 110,000 starts.They also take into account the probability that, as a result of the reduction instarts in 1962, work in progress will be speeded up.
PI    Water and SewerageThe figures assume a continuation into 1963-64 of the recent rising trend in expenditure, but a levelling off thereafter.other the main items in this group are (i) expenditure under the Town and country planning Act, rising rapidly from  18 millions in 1961-62 to  28-2 millions in1965-66 with the increasing rate of urban redevelopment and factory building bylocal authorities; and (ii) expenditure upon the mass of general services (ranging from town halls to street cleansing vehicles), for which the Department have provided for a small rise from  44 millions in 1961-62 to  48 millions in 1965-66.The large unsatisfied demand for investment in general services is already showingitself in the new programming arrangements which the Ministry and the localauthorities are developing. The present figures would mean keeping a very tightcheck on this demand,, and in particular would leave no room at all for any move towards the implementation of the Wolfenden Report on Sport.Ministry of TransportRoad ProgrammeThese figures represent the firm five-year programme approved by Ministers inthe summer.OtherPorts, road passenger transport, and road and street lighting are the main items in this group; others are car parks and unclassified roads and street works.Much of the expenditure, by its nature, is outside effective control. After theRochdale Committee have reported increases in expenditure on ports may besought for 1963-64 and later years.Ministry of EducationThese figures take account of cuts in minor works and youth service investment and a rephasing in the teacher training programme as a result of the Ministerialcorrespondence in July. This correspondence nevertheless left open the questionof the final totals for 1963-64 and subsequent years.University Grants CommitteeThese figures have been amended since the summer to take account of theeffect of the new costings.Ministry of HealthHospital services the figures are intended to represent the implementation of the long-term programme announced by the Minister in the early months of this year.Local Health and WelfareThis programme has been increasing rapidly, and the Department proposeexpenditure of  25 millions in 1963-64 with a levelling off at that figure in subsequent years. The figures for years 1963-64 are provisional since they are notyet based upon local authorities&apos; own forecasts of the schemes for which theywill seek loan sanction.Scottish DepartmentsHousingThe figures assume a continuation of the present approval of tenders withoutthe institution of an allocation system. No major change in the level of expenditure is envisaged in the course of the period.EducationThese figures represent reductions compared with those submitted in the spring. They are intended to be broadly comparable with the reductions in theMinistry of Education^ figures.
October 1961.Road Programme ..!^These figures represent the firm five-year programme approved by ministers in the summer.Water and SewerageThe figures assume a continuation into 1963-64 of the recent rising trend in expenditure, but a levelling off thereafter.Hospital services the figures are intended to represent the implementation of the long-term programme announced by the Secretary of State in February this year.OtherThis is expenditure on a wide range of small Scottish programmescorresponding to the &quot; other&quot; expenditure by the Ministries of Housing andTransport and to programmes of the Home Office and Ministry of Agricultureand the local health and welfare programme in England and Wales.Home office the main items in this group are prisons, police and fire services; other items are civil defence, child care and the administration of justice. Increases in expenditure on prisons and administration of justice may be sought for 1963-64and later years.Ministry of WorksThis is expenditure on Government buildings.
