C. (61) 19228th November, 1961CABINETSOUTHERN CAMEROONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall the anxieties felt in the summer over the situationwhich was likely to arise in the Southern Cameroons when it joined the Republic ofCameroun on 1st October.2. It will be remembered that the Southern Cameroons which had been under united Kingdom trusteeship and was administered as part of Nigeria voted in a plebiscite last February to gain independence by joining the neighbouring republic of Cameroun, which was formerly under French trusteeship. This decision was confirmed by the United Nations in April.3. The Republic had been struggling for years with Communist-inspiredterrorist organisations and it had been necessary to keep a battalion of Britishtroops in the Southern Cameroons to prevent the troubles from spreading acrossthe border. It appeared all too likely that when the battalion was withdrawn, asit had to be on 1st October, terrorism would spread to the Southern Cameroonsat once. /4. It appeared all too likely also that the leaders hi the Southern Cameroonswould not be able to agree on the terms of unification wiyi President Ahidjo and his ministers in the Republic. If that happened they might\make an unholy alliance with the terrorist and Left-wing parties in the Republics to overthrow PresidentAhidjo&apos;s Government. Communism would thereby gain\a fresh and substantialfoothold in West Africa. \5. In the face of these gloomy prospects we feared that -nearly all the british officials in the Southern Cameroons whose contracts expired oh. 1st October wouldbe unwilling to remain. The country could not run without them and if they wentit might well dissolve into chaos. This would among many other things imperil the British investment in the country of about  20 millions.6. Some of these fears may well revive later; but so far none of them havebeen realised. Mr. Foncha, the President of the Southern Cameroons, had a seriesof meetings with President Ahidjo throughout the summer and there were twotripartite meetings in which the United Kingdom also took part. Thanks largely to the statesmanship of President Ahidjo a form of Federal Constitution wasworked out which was acceptable to Mr. Foncha. The two States will retain theirseparate existence but all major powers will be in the hands of the federal authorities. The Federal Constitution is very much of the modern French type inthat the President will be executive in the fullest sense. There is a Vice-President(who is in fact Mr. Foncha) but he only performs such functions as the Presidentmay bestow upon him. The Prime Ministers of the two States and of the federal government are appointed by the President and he can remove Ministers if he wishes to do so. Federal Ministers are not responsible to the legislature.7. On the security side very close co-operation was established between the commanding Officer of the British battalion (the 1st Battalion of the GrenadierGuards) and the two senior officers of the Republic who are still French. Carefularrangements were made for an orderly handover to at least equal numbers of copy No.   g J60026- THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

Foreign Office, S.W. I,24th November, 1961.forces from the Republic. The handover went in. fact very smoothly. The Guardswere withdrawn at the beginning of October and there have been no reports of anyserious incidents since then.8. Because of the improved prospects about 50 of the British staff, or rather more than one-third, have decided to stay on. As long as they remain this maybe just sufficient to keep the machine of government going in the southern Cameroons, now that many services have been taken over by the new federal government. Mr. Field, the Commissioner, i.e., the head of the Administrationahd representative of The Queen, had of course to be withdrawn on 30th Septemberbut some other senior officials are remaining. Great credit is due to Mr. field for the way in which he carried out a most difficult and invidious task.9. As to external affairs, the sympathies of the present Government of theFederation are with the moderates. President Ahidjo sent to represent it at theUnited Nations a former Minister of the Southern Cameroons. President Ahidjoand Sir Abubakar, the Prime Minister of Nigeria, have both been most anxious that there should be friendly relations between the new Federation and Nigeria.Nigeria has been helpful in various matters to the Cameroons and the two countries are in fact on cordial terms.10. The banana producers in the Southern Cameroons are dependent on theUnited Kingdom for a market. We are continuing imperial preference until 1st October next. The arrangements thereafter will have to be considered as soonas the Federation has proceeded further with the harmonisation of the tariffs ofits two constituent States.11. The new Federation will of course have its troubles. The terrorist threathas by no means been eliminated and the country will be very short of money.In accordance with a Cabinet decision we are making a parting gift of  500,000to the Southern Cameroons (C.C. (61) 36th Conclusions, Minute 6) subsequentlyincreased to  575,000 to enable the salaries of British officials staying on to beincreased when the cost of living rises. But this will not go far to meet the deficitsof the Southern Cameroons, let alone of the Federal Government which is now tobe superimposed on the two State Governments. The Republic has always been heavily subsidised by France and we hope that France will now support theFederation too. Hers is indeed bound to be the major influence in it since theRepublic is five times as large as the Southern Cameroons and the federal currencywill be a franc currency. But the French are showing some reluctance to increase their already substantial contribution.12. It would be unwise to make any complacent prophecies. There are bound to be economic difficulties and we must expect that the terrorists will takeadvantage of any weaknesses to renew their attacks. But we can at present record that the transfer of power went smoothly and that we have been spared the embarrassment of a collapse into anarchy, which would have jeopardised the merger of the two territories and compromised our withdrawal.H.
