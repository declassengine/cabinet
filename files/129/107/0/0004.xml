Foreign affairs in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet&apos;s Meeting on 19th September(C.C. (61) 50th Meeting, Minute 3), I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following memorandum on the political situation&apos;in the Federal Republic ofGermany following the elections there, with particular reference to the role of theFree Democratic Party (F.D.P.). i: -   -i&apos;^ ym ^.mm;ih^.m-&apos;ry-The election result in percentages,of &quot;votes^cast, and&apos;compared with the lastFederal election in 1957, is:. . &quot;.&apos; jl&apos;;:&quot;ii1&apos;&apos;,:;&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;.&apos;&apos;!::        Per cent.

Their loss is attributed to the shockof the sealing of the sector border in Berlin and Western impotence in face of this;and also to Dr. Adenauer&apos;s behaviour in this last part of the election campaign.(On the other.hand, the Bavarian sister party, the C.S.U., held their own better,which should strengthen the position of Herr Strauss, who is their leader.) TheSocial Democrats, although unable to bring about a sweeping change in theirfortunes, have gained 2 million votes and done well enough to justify and consolidate the Party&apos;s moderate new-look programme and Herr Brandt&apos;s leadership. Thesplinter parties to both Right and Left made the worst showing ever; in particular,the Refugee Party suffered virtual extinction.The most important gain in the election was made by the F.D.P., they are an amalgamation of old-style liberals and younger radicals, whose main binding forcein the past has been dislike of the religious influences in the C.D.U., and of theSocialist character of the S.P.D. Dr. Mende (on whom a background note is annexed) became party chairman at the beginning of last year. In the election theFree Democrats had no very distinct policy, but offered a safe alternative todisappointed Christian Democrat voters, since they aimed at coalition with the christian Democrats but rejected coalition with the Social Democrats.59771
CONFIDENTIALIt seemed immediately after the election thai the F.D.P. would be thedetermining factor in the new German Government. This seems less likely now.After some days of uncertainty, Dr. Adenauer has marshalled the firm support ofhis party for his continuance in office, at least for a transitional period beforeProfessor Erhard succeeds. His first act was to patch up his relations with thelS.f\D., and though the latter will not participate with the C.D.U. in a coalition,^efeept perhaps in an extreme emergency, they are unlikely to make great difficulties for him or his Government. Dr. Mende, who at one time said that he would notserve under Dr. Adenauer (though he agreed to serve under Dr. Erhard) has now changed his tune and the most likely outcome is a coalition between the C.D.U.and the F.D.P., presided over for a limited period by Dr. Adenauer. Dr. Mendeis apparently unlikely to take office himself.In the past the F.D.P. have been more flexible than the other German parties on the question of Berlin and have seemed willing to move further and fastertowards de facto dealings with the East German regime, and towards diplomatic relations with the satellite countries. They even appeared at one time not to be altogether,averse to demilitarised zones and zones of inspection and control. on european questions they tended to blame Dr.&apos; Adenauer for being too much of alittle European, and they would like to see Britain in Europe. But it must beremembered that they are not a homogeneous party and that Dr. Mende&apos;s ideasare not shared by all his supporters.,   ,, . ,At the moment all eyes in Germany are on Berlin and there is a general feeling that in face of the trials ahead German, unify matters above all. It is unlikelytherefore that foreign affairs will become an issue between the parties or that thechange of Government will cause any marked change in the Federal Government^foreign policy. This does not mean to say that there will be no change. It means that if there is, notably over Berlin, it will reflect the evolution of United states policy and the pressure of circumstances rather than the influence of Dr. Mende.Illlll   HI! I      &apos; I llllllllllll l   &apos;H.&apos;Foreign Office, S.W.1, 1. &apos;16th October, 1961. ; &quot;&apos; CONFIDENTIALWFJ.3ANNEXBACKGROUND NOTE ON Dr. ERICH MENDEChairman of F.D.P. and leader of Parliamentary Party.Born 1916 in Upper Silesia. Catholic. Married. Fought in Second WorldWar, returning in 1945 to study law at Bonn and Cologne Universities. Tookpart in the Constitution of the F.D.P. in North Rhine-Westphalia as a result ofwhich he was elected to the Bundestag upon the F.D.P. reserve list. Electedjoint Deputy Chairman of the F.D.P. in 1956 and Chairman in 1960.Mende came to the public notice primarily as the champion of imprisonedwar criminals and still regards himself as a military expert, a spokesman for thejunior members of the former officer class, and likes to appear as an expert onreunification questions. He also believes that it is his task to bring into thedemocratic field all those Germans of his own generation who might otherwisebe lured away by extremists. He is one of the very few younger Germans who havealready achieved prominence, and is likely to play a conspicuous part in Germanpolitics for some time to come. He is imbued with burning ambition, and canscarcely be relied upon not to throw in his lot with some future nationalistmovement, if only under the guise of introducing a moderating influence. He isGod&apos;s gift to foreign diplomats in Bonn, since he is ready to talk with almostembarrassing freedom on political secrets in order to demonstrate his ownimportance.A tough, energetic and likeable man with a friendly and disarming manner.Looks like a rugger forward. He has always made a point of keeping on goodterms with the British, for whom he honestly has much respect. Speaks quitegood English. Has an ambitious, lively and attractive wife. She is a bit of a snoband so is he.CONFIDENTIAL
