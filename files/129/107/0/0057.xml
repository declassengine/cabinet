THE PAY PAUSEMemorandum by the Minister of TransportRailwaymen&apos;s wages will present us with a difficult problem in thenext few weeks.    Consideration of their claim has led me to the follow-ing thoughts about wages generally.2.      In 1960-61 personal incomes (mostly wages and salaries) went upby  1,450 millions while production only increased by  650 millions.The two problems are:-(a) To correct this.(b) To be seen to correct it - i. e. , Presentation.Corrective Action3.      Cash paid to workers is generally made up as follows:-(a) Basic Wage Rate (so much per hour orper week).(b) Incentives Earned (e. g. , genuine over-time.(c) Incentives not Earned (e. g. , attendancemoney, subsistence, travelling allowance,up-grading of loaders at London Airport).Generally, postmen, dustmen, workers in Government and nationalised industries get (a) and (b).    But private enterprise pacemakers get(a), (b) and (c).4.     Therefore in practice freezing the Basic Wage rate alonecannot succeed.5.      There are only two ways to control the cash received by wage earners:-(a) Control by the State - with effective sanctions.(b) Deflation - with unemployment at a level whichimposes discipline but not despair.C. (61) 207 COPY NO.  5/5th December, 1961CABINET
f&quot;5 q o*5 hi hi6.     In a free society 5(a) is impossible.    Also the paper by officials(Annex C of C. (61) 205) rejected sanctions as impracticable.     There-fore, we are forced to the conclusion that to do something effectivelywe must deflate.Presentation7.      We must consider how to present the new stage in our policy.Three factors are:-(a) End of the PauseThe pause must either end or fade away (or perhaps run away)early in 1962.    Everyone (including Zurich bankers) accepted it   as atemporary measure.    It showed we were determined and wasconsidered effective.How do we end it?    Or does it just fade away?I suggest we ought to end it and be seen to end it for two reasons:-(i)  It shows we remain determined and in control.    (to let it fade implies we are not in control. )(ii)  We may not be able to hold the pause unless we make an early statement.(b) InjusticesThose who have genuinely suffered injustice, not only frompostponement but because their claim is justified on other grounds,should be the first to benefit from a new policy.(c) Comparability of WagesStrict comparability a. la Guillebaud (the Committee on railway wages under the Chairmanship of Professor Guillebaud) is undesirable.It produces rigidity in the movement of men.But a reasonable and flexible degree of comparability is inevitable because:-(i)   Craftsmen in a company or industry which must continue will not be satisfied if similar crafts-men in another firm or industry get a greatdeal more money (e. g. , a carpenter will notstay at the Post Office if a carpenter in the motor trade gets twice his earnings).(ii)  Some men must be retained in declining industries and public service industries.
(iii)  Some men must move to expanding industries.Of course loss-making industries such asRailways always should be a few per cent behind the rest.    But to go too far behind will bringdisaster.Statement8.      I suggest an interim statement before Christmas to hold theposition until the results of 1961 are known (and/or until the new policycan be made clear in the Budget).As a cockshy here are some possible ingredients for that state -ment:-(a)  Pause.    The pause must stay until the 1961 results are known.05)  Injustices.     We recognise the pause has producedinjustices.     Therefore, if productivity warrantsit, the first candidates for pay rises will be thoseadversely affected by the pause - i. e. , those whoare way behind the pacemakers.(c) Comparability of Wages.    Strict comparability is out.     But some degree is inevitable.(d) Independent Tribunal.     There will be an independent tribunal.    Its task will be:-(i)   To receive from the Chancellor of theExchequer a total figure which can be allocated to wage increases.(ii)   To advise on which set of workers are wellbehind in the rate and to let them withinreason catch up (if productivity orelementary justice warrants it).(iii)   To distinguish between a percentage increasegranted to catch up and one which startsanother round.    And to report to the nationaccordingly (e. g. , at present Railwaymenare about 10 per cent behind incomparability.     Yet to grant them5 per cent would produce a howl thatRailways have set the pace once again and that the Government have soldthe pass.
(iv)  Power has shifted from, the employers to theunions.    Both have deployed good and badarguments either to support or reject wage increases.    But power decided the result.Perhaps the Tribunal could build up a caselaw of what is good and bad argument.    we ought to aim at building a measure of stability and continuity into the proceed-ings.(e)   Taxes.    But if wages (e.g. , railway wages) cannot bepaid for out of increases of productivity and so haveto be paid out of taxes, then some effort must he made to bring this point home to the nation (e. g, ,6 per cent increase on railway wages equals Id.: ona pint of beer, or 50 per cent increase in taxation on television and betting).E.M.Ministry of Transport, S. E. 1.4th December, 1961.-4-
