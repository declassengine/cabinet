Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1961C. (61) 159 Copy No.     5 711th October, 1961CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have read the paper (C. (61) 150) by the Minister of Aviation with great interest. I regret that he should be deeply concerned about the future of this industry despite the assistance which we have already agreed to provide. I am by no means clear whether, even if we do most of the things which the Ministersuggests, we shall not be faced with similar problems for the indefinite future.A fairly stringent policy on Government aid to private industry is, in my view,an essential part of any general plan for the proper direction of resources. Is it,therefore, a prima facie conflict between the needs of the aircraft industry andour policy on aid to industry?2. It may be helpful if I begin by setting out one or two facts. On the militaryside, production for the Services fell from its then post-war record of  242 millions in 1957 to  198 millions in 1958 and rose to  243 millions in .1960. Orders alsorose, and the level of military orders on hand at the end of 1960 was higher thanat any other time since the war. On the civil side, expenditure in aid of thedevelopment and proving of transport aircraft has risen from  3-8 millions in1958-59 to  8-1 millions (estimate) in the current year. This reflects the commitments we have undertaken to provide over  30 millions towards the launching costs of the V.C.-10, Trident, Rotodyne and B.A.C.-111 aircraft and theR.B.-163 engine. In addition, the Aeronautical Research Programme (militaryand civil) has risen steadily from  22 millions in 1958-59 to  25^ millions (estimate)this year.3. In this situation the industry is showing an increasing level of employment(it has risen from 284,000 in June 1959 to 299,000 in June 1961) and several firms have increased their profits (accompanied in two cases by increased dividends)this year. But the reorganisation which took, place at the beginning of 1960 hasnot apparently so far resulted in any substantial streamlining to judge by theemployment figures or to have reduced the extent to which the industry lives on military orders (60-2 per cent, of the total in 1957; 65-6 per cent, in 1960). Thisis in striking contrast to the United States industry, where employment has fallen by about one-quarter since 1957 but civil orders have risen by about the same amount. Nor do the orders so far placed for the civil aircraft which we aresupporting suggest that the proportion of United Kingdom civil orders is likelyto rise substantially over the next few years or that more than a small part ofthe Government investment in them is likely to be recovered. My fear is that theprincipal effect of the  30 millions which we have contributed and promised forthe support of civil aircraft has been to increase the level of the resources (includingscarce skilled manpower) devoted to uneconomic projects. As far as exports areconcerned, I have been given to understand that, although the recent record hasbeen good, we face a big drop over the next few years and it is by no means clearthat we can hope for a substantial improvement later even if the Governmentdecide to support the projects which the industry is putting forward.4. In this connexion it is relevant to look at our experience so far with the projects through which we have implemented the policy announced inFebruary 1960. Development assistance has been offered or granted to fiveprojects. One of these, the V.C.-11, fell through for lack of a firm initial order.Two others, the B.A.C.-111 aircraft and the Rolls-Royce R.B.-163 engine, are still at too early a stage to form a judgment about their commercial prospects.59812THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
5. The fourth is the V.C.-10 aircraft. We have agreed to contribute 10 millions to its development. 45 aircraft (including two for Nigerian Airways)have been ordered by British Overseas Airways Corporation who would almost certainly have preferred a United States aircraft if their decision had been guidedpurely by economic criteria. Five have been ordered by the Royal Air Force,four by British United Airways and three by Ghana Airways. The money spentthe manufacturers ( 26 millions) on developing this aircraft would not, so faras?one can judge at present, be recovered until about 150 had been sold; the moneycontributed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government not until over 200 had been sold.6. The fifth project is the D.H.-121 aircraft. Her Majesty&apos;s Government haveagreed to contribute  5 millions to its development. 24 have been ordered byBritish European Airways none by any other operator; nor is there any good prospect of further orders. For the manufacturers to recover their expenditureon development some 70 would need to be sold; for Her Majesty&apos;s government over 90.7. I do not want to comment in detail about what is said on the military side,since doubtless the Minister of Defence will wish to explain the position more fully.I would only say that, prima facie, I should have thought that the activities of theaircraft industry for defence should be determined by defence planning; and thatwe should be careful lest on the contrary the problems of the industry may cometo determine our weapon policy and hence our defence policy. Like all mycolleagues, I hope that we shall shortly be able to formulate a defence plan for thenext five to ten years which will make the best use of the resources that are likelyto be available, bearing in mind that the present forecasts for 1965-66 of the service departments will have to be significantly reduced if defence is to make its contribution to our general plan for Government expenditure as a whole. Withina reasonable defence planning framework, I would hope that development of,and orders for, aircraft and guided missiles would find a natural place. (It remains to be seen whether the proposed military order of Rotodynes (paragraph 14 of theMinister^ paper) could be accommodated within such a plan.) I should also liketo express the hope that in any future major projects estimating of cost and time will be as realistic as possible. From my point of view the root of the matter lies in the fact that estimates tend to change so markedly as a project gets under way.This must inevitably lead to reconsideration.8. I am a little disturbed to read what is said about future aviation policyin America in paragraph 7 of the Minister^ paper. In other contexts we are continually being urged by the present Administration to play a large, and indeedincreasing, part in the defence of the free world. I suggest that it must be made clear that we can only maintain anything like our present level of effort if we aregiven a fair deal in export markets, at least on the military side. I would hopethat the Minister of Defence or the Foreign Secretary might feel able to make this point at an appropriate moment. For, unless the present United states administration is prepared to face up to our difficulties in this important sphere of interdependence, it seems to me that we may have to reconsider our presentefforts to make a policy of interdependence work.9. As regards the civil side of the industry, what bothers me is that economic prospects do not seem to be improving. It is beginning to look as if we are facedwith the prospect over the next five to ten years of putting large sums of moneyinto development of civil aircraft which will not themselves produce an appropriatereturn, even when they are ordered by the main British operators. A prolonged period of heavily subsidised air travel at the expense of the taxpayer is not an attractive prospect for the Treasury. This seems to me to have a particular bearing on one of the immediate problems with which we are confronted, namely that ofthe supersonic airliner, where the prospects seem at best highly speculative andthe costs would have to be borne almost wholly by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Given our general economic position and our new policy on aid to industry generally, I suggest that we should think very carefully indeed before embarking on what I fear might prove to be a major project of a wholly uneconomiccharacter and one which would make the industry more and more dependent on government aid. As regards other civil projects mentioned in the Minister^paper, I am prepared in principle to look at these from time to time, but I must make it clear that the criteria which in my view should be employed will haveto be pretty stringent.  I am not suggesting that we should depart from the criteria
mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Ministers paper but they will have to be appliedagainst the background of our general policy on aid to industry.10. I agree with the view, accepted by my predecessor, that the aeronautical research Programme, should continue at about its present level. I see some difficulty in the proposal that there should be flexibility between it and the militaryand civil development programmes. I suggest that this and the level of expenditurein future years should be discussed in the first place between officials.11. The object of the policy announced in February 1960 was to maintain a strong and efficient aircraft industry. This should still be our object. But itshould, I suggest, be our aim to ensure that at the earliest possible moment theindustry can stand on its own feet as genuine private enterprise, profitable to itsshareholders and unsubsidised by the taxpayer.12. This will be difficult to achieve in any case. But it will be impossibleunless the industry is allowed, and if necessary encouraged, to find an economiclevel of capacity. The experience of the projects in paragraphs 4-6 above, and theprospects of the supersonic airliner suggest that the industry is at present devotingits own and public resources to projects which are uneconomic, and that its capacityought to be reduced accordingly. In fact, as indicated in paragraph 2 above,employment has risen to 299,000. This is a very different picture from thatpresented by the United States aircraft industry (see again paragraph 2 above). i therefore welcome the Minister^ view (paragraph 9) that there is a case for a plannedreduction.13. I am sure that all my colleagues would agree that it would be useless toput big sums of the taxpayers&apos; money into the development of civil aircraft projectsmerely for the purpose of maintaining production and capacity at any particularlevel. Not only would it be completely wasteful to do so, but when the projectswere completed nothing would have been done to solve the problem of surplus capacity. The money would have been better spent, if necessary, in helping the manufacturer to rid himself of surplus capacity or diversify his enterprise.14. These are some of the considerations which must be borne in mind in considering any new projects for assistance to civil aircraft and engines which may come up from time to time. (I include in this category the British european airways / Sabena operation of Vertol 107s.) Such projects should I suggest be examined by officials according to the economic criteria which are to be established in connection with the Public Expenditure Survey.15. On the military side it seems even more important to ensure that the workof the aircraft industry is devoted to meet genuine military requirements. This isa subject on which the Management of Research Committee have recently made anumber of most important recommendations. The Minister of Defence is, Iunderstand, at present engaged in putting these recommendations into practicethrough the Defence Research Policy Committee.Summary16. (a) It should be our long-term aim to encourage the industry to becomeself-supporting (this will mean some contraction in capacity). It must be recognisedthat, if we decide to support projects which seem uneconomic, we are making the achievement of this aim that much harder.(b) As regards decisions on military projects, we must seek to ensure that militaryorders are geared to the essential requirement of a manageable long-term defenceplan.(c) Civil helicopter policy requires further examination in the light of a decisionon the military version of the Rotodyne.id) The relationship between aeronautical research and military/civildevelopment should be examined further by officials.(e) The supersonic project will involve us shortly in a major and very difficult decision. We must realise that if we were to enter this field, the prospects ofmaking the industry less, rather than more, dependent on the taxpayer would recedefor a very long time to comeS.
