^ CONFIDENTIAL^^^^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 1516th October, 196]CIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT:   WHITE PAPER, 1961Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerFollowing the publication, in November, I960, of &quot;public investment in Great Britain&quot; (Cmnd. 1203), we are under an obligation to publish a further White Paper on public investment this year.     Theaccompanying draft, which has been prepared after consultation with theDepartments concerned, is circulated accordingly.2. The draft White Paper is based upon the decisions taken on public investment in July this year (C. C. (61) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5);minor adjustments have since been made to some of the figures ofexpenditure, mainly as a result of re-estimation by Departments.    Themain changes are in the estimates of expenditure by the Air corporations and on the housing programme in England and Wales.3. As last year, the White F^aper will be in two parts - Part Onedealing in general terms with civil public investment and Part Two givingfactual notes on the individual programmes.    In the attached draft,Part One is mainly devoted to (i) an explanation of the reasons for treatingthe investment of the nationalised industries and public corporationssomewhat differently from the capital expenditure of the central Govern-ment and local authorities (a distinction we have made this year for thefirst time);   (ii) an anlysis of developments in the field of civil public investment since the I960 White Paper;  and (iii) an explanation of theGovernments decisions on public investment for 1962-63.4. Proposals are now before Ministers for the importation ofliquid methane gas (C.(6l) 144).     These, if approved, will entail anincrease of  8 millions in gas investment in 1962-63 and will call forsome revision of the text and figures in the present draft.    Afterallowance for the extra expenditure upon methane, the annual totalswill be:-  millions (rounded)1959-60 1960-61 1961-62 1962-631,620 1,640 1, 755 1,8501-COPY NO.cabinet confidential
CONFIDENTIAL75. In addition, proposals for increased investment in electricitywill be coming before us in the Investment Review at the end of thismonth.    These affect the years after 1962-63, but, if approved, they will mean some further increase in expenditure in 1962-63.    But decisions on this will not be reached before the White Paper is printed.6. I invite my colleagues to agree to publication of a white paper on the lines of the attached draft, subject to any amendments whichmaybe required as a result of decisions upon methane gas (paragraph 4),and any minor amendments which may be found necessary before finalprinting.S.

PART one government control of public investment(i) general. In November 1960 the White Paper Public Investment in Great Britain(Grind. 1203) brought together for the first time in a single document infor-mation about prospective public investment and notes on the variousprogrammes.2. It is convenient to express this investment as one aggregate covering the whole public sector. But within this aggregate two main groups may be distinguished, namely(i) investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations, and(ii) public service capital expenditure by the Central Government andlocal authorities.(ii) Investment by the Nationalised Industries and Public Corporations3. In April 1961 the Government published a White Paper clarifying thefinancial responsibilities of the nationalised industries in order to establish a firmer framework for their future operations (The Financial and EconomicObligations of the Nationalised Industries, cmnd.. 1337). As paragraphs 24-26of that document make clear, the procedures for discussion and authorisation of proposals for investment and borrowing by Hhe nationalised industriescontinue as before; but the new approach implies that the criteria to beemployed for the scrutiny of the industries&apos; proposals must be rather different from those used in relation to most of the public service capital expenditureof the Central Government and local authorities. Proposals for fresh invest-ment by the nationalised industries raise special considerations since theymust be viewed not only against the need to provide essential supplies and services but also in relation to the extent to which they assist the industry concerned to reach the required standard of financial performance.4. Although.the nationalised industries&apos; programmes are financed in wholeor in part by the Exchequer (the extent differs according to their financial circumstances), the Government do not in general seek to control the individual projects of nationalised industries ; they are primarily concerned with thescale and trend of long-term programmes and aggregates of expenditure.(iii) Public service capital expenditure by the Central Government and LocalAuthorities.5. The essential characteristics of public service capital expenditure are that commercial profitability in the normal sense is often meaningless, and thatinvestment decisions nave to be taken on broad grounds of public interest. Butthere is great variety in the programmes, the criteria which should govern them,and the methods by which they are administered. Some programmes are wholly financed from Votes and are the direct responsibility of the department concerned (for example, motorways); others, though wholly financed fromVotes, are carried out by non-departmental bodies (for example, Universitiesor Regional Hospital Boards). Local authority programmes are in generalfinanced by local authority boarrowing.   In some cases the service of the
capital is subsidised by special Exchequer grants (for example, housing); inV^others (for example, education) it is subsidised indirectly through the general grant; and in others it is borne entirely by the local authority. The building programmes are administered by the local authorities under varying degrees of supervision from the responsible Department.6. It follows that the methods which the Government employ to influence the various kinds of public service capital expenditure must differ greatly.Thus, within the ambit of local authorities&apos; investment, the government control mainly by loan sanction, and in some cases by specific authorisationfor new projects. In other cases, where the expenditure is on Votes, thecontrol is direct.7. Some sectors of public investment do not fall readily into either of the categories shown in paragraph 2. The Atomic Energy Authority, for example,has much in common with the nationalised industries and yet is less of acommercial organisation than any of them. On the other hand, some of theservices performed by the local authorities, and even by Government Depart-ments, are primarily commercial in nature (for example, aerodromes andhaitbours). While, therefore, ithe distinction in principle between the two categories is clear and justifiable, the special characteristics of some pro-grammes will always call for individual treatment.(iv) The purposes of control -8. A brief description of Government control over the public investment programmes was given in paragraphs 11 and 12 of Public Investment in GreatBritain (Cmnd. 1203X1).  This control has three purposes:  (a) Resources to keep aggregate long-term public investment within thelimits set by prospective economic resources and other claims upon them.(Jb) Flexibility to provide for the possible need for limited short-tenmadjustments, upwards and downwards, in accordance with theeconomic situation.These principles of control apply to all the public investment programmes in both the main groups described above, the precise manner Of application being determined by the special characteristics of the programmes and the differentcriteria relating to investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations and public service capital expenditure by the Central Govern-ment and local authorities.Civil public investment 1959/60-1962/63(i) Total expenditure 1959-19639. Expenditure on civil public investment has increased markedly in recentyears. Between 1955/56 and 1959/60 it rose from  1,275 million to 1,620 million. This upward trend eased off in 1960/61, but is expectedto be resumed this year and to continue in 1962/63.(&apos;) The field which is covered by the control is fixed investment (as distinct from, e.g.,working capital) of the Government, local authorities and nationalised industries and other public corporations, however financed.5
10. Expenditure on the various programmes between 1959/60 and 1962/63*is shown in detail in Part Two: here it may be summarized as follows:  0).   r  million (rounded)	Actual prices		March 1961 prices		1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	out-turn	estimated out-turn	estimates as at 1st October, 1961	Nationalised industries and public corpora-				tions: 				National Coal Board    .........	108	94	97	95Gas Council and Area Boards......	48	43	47	49Electricity Council and Area Boards and				Scottish Boards        .........	357	336	363	396Air Corporations............	31	47	44	37British Transport Commission ...	206	204	175	177Atomic Energy Authority.......	37	36	36	32Post Office...............	94	100	107	118Other      ......	5	6	12	10Totals (rounded)    ...      ....              ...	885	865	880	915  million					Actual	prices	March 1961 prices	-,-.1 r(;i   &apos;	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63		estimated	estimates as at		out-turn	out-turn	1st October, 1961	Central Government and local authorities: 				Roads (2)...............	86	98	113	127Education^)      ...                       ...	138	142	160	169HousingC)         ... .    ,.,	285	280	273	272Water and Sewerage     ...   &apos; ...	73	76	95	106Hospitals and local health and welfare				services ...      ...    .......	37	43	56	66Other central government services(5)  ...

Grand Total (rounded)     	735	775	875	930	1,620	1,640	1,755	1,845(&apos;) There is one important difference between the investment covered in this document and that dealt with in Cmnd. 1203. Last year&apos;s White Paper included investment in theRoyal Ordnance Factories and married quarters and land for the Services, though it excludedall other expenditure on buildings and equipment for the Armed Forces. This year the definition has been more narrowly drawn to cover civil public investment only. Some smallerchanges in coverage have also been made. Investment by certain port and harbour authoritiesand grant-aided bodies not previously taken into account has been included. There havealso been some changes in expenditure charged to capital account by the National coal board and the Post Office, and these affect their investment figures. These changes are described in Part Two and in Appendix I. To help comparison all the figures above havebeen placed upon this new footing.(2) Including unclassified roads and road lighting.(3) Including university investment financed by the University Grants Committee.(4) Local authorities, new towns and housing associations.(5)&apos;For example, Government buildings, civil aerodrome services, prisons (see page     ).i6) For example, harbours, police and fire services (see page     ).
--r*v 11. Expenditure on the programmes of the nationalised industries, thef-f public corporations and the Post Office accounts for one-half of all civilpublic investment. The electricity programmes are the largest followed by those of the British Transport Commission and the Post Office. About two-fifths of the total consists of expenditure on programmes executed by thelocal authorities. Of these housing is substantially the largest single pro-programme, followed by education, though the aggregate of small pro-grammes is a large, and growing, element in the total. The remaining one-tenth of the total is expenditure upon programmes carried out by thecentral government. Of these the motor-way and trunk road programme isthe largest, though, as with local authorities, the aggregate of small pro-grammes is a substantial and growing part of the whole.(ii) Out-turn of expenditure in 1960/61 and 1961/6212. Because of changes in ithe price basis and in definition, the figures shown above cannot be compared directly with those given in November1960 (Cmnd. 1203). The following table compares the annual totals, withadjustments for changes in price and definition.(rounded)   million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	estimated out-turn	forecast out-turn	approved total	-1960 Review As in Cmnd. 1203 and at prices of 1960 review(&apos;)        ............	1,620	1,710	1,730	v&apos;;&apos;- HAt prices of 1960 review(&apos;) but on new (1961) definition^)     ............

Throughout 1960/61 evidence was accumulating that the final out-turnof expenditure in that year Would fall significantly short in real terms ofthe total of  1,710 millions shown in Cmnd. 1203. In paragraph 14 ofGmnd. 1203 the out-turn was tentatively put at  1,670 million. It is now estimated at  1,640 million, a fall of fT per cent, in volume upon the initialestimate of  1,710 million, after adjustment to the new (1961) definition andthe prices of the 1961 review.14. This short-fall was probably attributable in part to the uncertaintiesinherent in forward estimates of investment to which reference was made inparagraph 13 of Cmnd. 1203. But another force at work in 1960/61 was the(&apos;) Actual prices of 1959-60: prices of March 1960 for later years.(2) See footnote to paragraph 10.(3) Actual prices of 1959-60 and 1960-61: prices of March 1961 for later years.7
heavy load upon the building and civil engineering industries in England^and wales which prevented work (especially in the public sector) frorx.proceeding as quickly as had been hoped.15. Total expenditure in 1961/62 is expected to be not far short of the approved total of  1,730 million shown in Cmnd. 1203 after adjustment for changes in price and definition, within this total there are some programmes in which expenditure is running ahead of the estimate made in 1960;others where expenditure is falling behind. Some of the nationalised industries (notably electricity and the Post Office) have felt the need for^expanded programmes to meet further increases in the level of demand.In some of the social service programmes also the pressure towards expansionhas been strong, particularly where expenditure has been restricted in thepast.(iii) Approved total expenditure 1962/6316. The approved total of expenditure on public investment for 1962/63is  1,845 million, some  90 million more than the estimated out-turn for1961/62. The upward trend in public investment is thus expected tocontinue in that year.17. The increase would indeed have been much greater but for action taken by the Government to hold back the rate of implementation of anumber of programmes. This formed part of the series of measures taken inthe summer of 1961 to relieve the pressure of internal demand and toincrease the long-term strength of the economy. Public investment demand,in common with total public expenditure, was showing signs of undulyrapid increase at that time, and, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer statedwhen he introduced the Governments economic measures, an immediatecontribution was needed from the public sector towards relieving the overall pressure upon the economy (House of Commons Official Report25th July 1961: Col. 223) The decisions on public investment in 1962/63formed an indispensible part of this contribution.18. The detailed adjustment of planned expenditure upon individual pro-grammes in 1962/63 is also designed to serve the second, longer-term,objective of Government policy on public expenditure to which theChancellor of the Exchequer drew attention: namely, the redeployment ofpublic services and priorities in such a way as to bring the rate of increaseof total expenditure into a better relationship with prospective resources andto strengthen the nation&apos;s efficiency and competitive power (House ofCommons Official Report, 26th July 1961, Col. 435). So far as possible,therefore, the slowing down of investment plans has been concentrated notonly where it will do most to relieve the pressures upon the economy,particularly upon the (building and civil engineering industries, but alsowhere it will conflict least with the aim of increasing national efficiency and productivity. Care has been taken not to disrupt work in progress: and therephasing of expenditure has been executed in accordance with the general principles set out in Part I of Cmnd. 1203 and referred to in paragraph 8of this White Paper.19. The Government have asked the nationalised industries to avoidinvestment expenditure in 1962/63 where this can be done without damage
-Y to the central objectives of attaining their financial targets and providing^ essential supplies and services.   This is in conformity with the criteria for investment by the nationalised industries implied by the policies set out in cmnd. 1337 and discussed in paras. 3 and 4 above.20. The Government have also invited local authorities to eliminate orpostpone inessential investment and to arrange priorities so as to concent-trate expenditure on services for which there is an urgent need. They havewarned the authorities in England and Wales that in local authority housing,where construction periods have been lengthening since the beginning of1960, and tender prices have risen, the approval of new starts in 1962 willbe reduced below recent levels ; and they have asked for postponement of applications for loan sanction for water and sewerage projects that are not immediately necessary. Loan sanctions for new swimming baths and otherrecreational schemes will not be issued for the time being, and in the field of general services local authorities have been asked to review their capital projects with a view to postponing them wherever possible. In the educationprogrammes a reduction has been made in the planned level of minor works in England and Wales and the building programme in Scotland will berephased; in the rest of this field special consideration will be given to theneeds of scientific and technical education. On roads the Government havedecided upon a firm plan extending over five years and involving substantial increases upon the present rate of expenditure. More details about theseadjustments appear in the notes on programmes given in Part Two of this white Paper.21. As indicated in paragraph 17, these adjustments are designed to moderate the growth of public investment rather than to stop any increases.Expenditure on some programmes is expected to be lower in 1962/63 thanin 1961/62, but this is either the continuation of a general downward trend,as in the case of the National Coal Board and the Atomic Energy Authority,or the product of special circumstances, as in the case of local authority housing. In the majority of programmes expenditure is expected to be somewhat higher, in real terms, in 1962/63 than in 1961/62. There areincreases in estimated expenditure on the electricity programme, on roads,on hospitals and on the Post Office programme and, despite the adjustmentsreferred to above, on the education programme and on water.and sewerage and local authority small programmes. Within the total for public investment the volume of new construction is expected to increase with expenditurerising from  955 million in 1961/62 to  1,005 million in 1962/63.

Investment by the coal industry in Great Britain comprises expenditure by the Headquarters and regional Divisions of the National Coal Board onthe extension of mechanisation, the replacement of plant, opencast mining,the manufacture of smokeless fuels, colliery housing workshops and otherancillary operations.23. The demand for coal recovered from 194 million tons in 1959 to 202Jmillion tons in 1960, when inland consumption and exports exceededavailability by nearly 8 million tons. Stocks of coal held by the Boardfell by 6J million tons. So far this year consumption has run slightly belowthe level of 1960 and production has fallen by nearly A\ million tons. Afurther reduction of over 6f million tons has been made in the Board&apos;sstockholdings so far this year, and a further substantial reduction is expectedduring the coming winter.24. By the end of 1960 the Board has spent  380 million on capital account on major colliery schemes (schemes costing over  250,000). Ofthis sum about  146 million is accounted for by expenditure upon 160 major schemes substantially completed by the end of last year, and  234 million by expenditure so far incurred upon 128 uncompleted schemes. During 1960work on 10 major colliery schemes and 2 large coal preparation plantswas approved. The bulk of the expenditure for 1962/63 will be uponschemes already in progress.25. An important part of expenditure on smaller colliery schemes,amounting in 1960 to some  27 million, is accounted for by the Board&apos;programme for the mechanisation of coal production. The cost of equippinga face for full mechanisation may be between  50,000 and  100,000. During1960 the proportion of power loaded coal rose from 32 per cent, to 38 percent., and by the end of 1961 the Board expects to be getting nearly halfof its saleable output by this means. To obtain this increase up to 400 newmachines are being installed.26. The Board&apos;s programme includes expenditure on ancillary activities,for example on coke ovens and smokeless fuel plants, and the extension ofa plant at Aberaman which manufactures &quot; Phurnacite&quot;, an anthracitesmokeless briquette.

Under a revision of the capital-revenue code of the Board which took effect from 1st January 1961, some items of expenditure previously charged to revenue are now charged to capital account. The effect of this change hasbeen to increase actual capital expenditure in 1960/61 by  1 million and estimated capital expenditure in 1961/62 and 1962/63 by some  5  million and  6 million respectively. Capital expenditure in 1960/61 nevertheless fellbelow the estimate given in November 1960 (Cmnd. 1203) as a result of economies and deferment of some expenditure to later years.Gas Council and Area Boards_   million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Gas manufacture     ...      .........	171	15-4	16-8	17-3Distribution and consumer services	28-0	25-1	27-1	26-other....................	2-5	.2-8	3-1	5-5Total   ............	47-6	43-3	47-0	49-0The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheets of the Gas Council and area Boards at 31st March 1961 was  501 million.30. Investment by the gas industry in Great Britain comprises expenditure by the twelve Area Boards on gas manufacture and distribution and by the gas Council on research (included under the head of other expenditure in the table).
v/ , 31. Investment continues to provide for the modernisation and integration54.^&apos;1 of the industry&apos;s fixed assets in accordance with the development plan set outin the Gas CounciFs booklet Gas Looks Ahead published in February 1960.The Gas Council now forecasts an increase of 8 per cent, in demand for gasover the next 5 years from a total of 2,665 million therms in 1960/61 to2,868 million therms in 1965/66.32. Investment in 1960/61 amounted to  43-3 million, compared with  48 million estimated in November 1960 (Cmnd. 1203). This underspending was mainly due to a slower rate of work on projects than had originally beenenvisaged.33. The gas industry has placed proposals before the Government for theimportation of liquified natural gas. If this scheme is approved, it might involve some increase in investment in 1962/63. The scheme would call for investment in an importing terminal and in a high pressure trunk main to transmit the gas to Area Boards. The net additional investment by the Boardsthemselves would be small. The total expenditure involved up to 1965/66would be within the total of  25 million allowed for in Gas Looks Ahead inrespect of new methods of gas supply.Electricity Council and Boards in England and Wales  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Central Electricity Generating Board Generation: Conventional stations   ... 1 ...

Investment by the electricity supply industry in England and Walescomprises expenditure by the Central Electricity Generating Board ongenerating stations and the main transmission system and by the twelve area boards on local distribution.35. At 31st March 1961 the total output capacity of the Generating Board&apos;power stations was 27,067 MW. At the end of 1961 the output capacityof the Board&apos;s stations is expected to be 29,300 MW and at the end of 196231,800 MW. It is expected that [12,848 MW] of new plant will be cornmis-sioned in the years 1961-65 inclusive.36. The Board have decided to embark upon a 400 kV main transmissionnetwork which will to a substantial extent make use of and replace existing275 kV lines. The new system will cater for the growth of demand for electricity and at the same time permit of a reduction in the number of newlines otherwise required, thus contributing to the preservation of amenities.
This strengthening of the supergrid involves some bringing forward ofexpenditure on transmission.37. About half of the expenditure by the Area Boards is upon reinforcingthe distribution system to meet the steadily increasing demands of consumers,mainly those already connected to the system. The other major element,accounting for about two-fifths of expenditure each year, is upon newelectrification. The Boards&apos; plans also provided for expenditure of over 2 million a year on standardising systems of supply.38. Total investment in fixed assets by the Generating and Area boards in 1960/61 was  3T million (about 1 per cent.) more than was estimated in November 1960 (Cmnd. 1203). At  315-7 million the present estimateof fixed investment in 1961/62 is  11-3 million more than was estimated inNovember 1960. This increase is made up of a rise of  5 million in expenditure by the Generating Board on nuclear power stations, broughtabout by an alteration in the incidence of expenditure over the years,and a rise of  6-3 million in expenditure by Area Boards. The latter is dueto the unexpectedly high rate of load growth which the Boards are having to meet and to increases in costs.39. The figures given in the table of expenditure for nuclear fuel relate toinitial charges only. In previous statements expenditure on stocks for replace-ment purposes has also been included. Since stocks of fuel are normallyregarded as working capital, all expenditure on nuclear fuel, except initialcharges, will in future be treated in this way.40. Estimated expenditure on nuclear fuel in 1961/62 is  4-8 million lessthat the estimate given in November 1960 partly because of the changereferred to in paragraph.39 but mainly because of the re-phasing of payments to the Atomic Energy Authority.41. As a result of these changes total investment in 1961/62 is estimatedat  324-5 million,  6-5 million above the estimate given in November 1960(Cmnd. 1203). The Minister has reviewed the industry&apos;s current capital development programme and has approved the revised level of expenditure for 1961/62.42. The rate of growth of electricity consumption is increasing. This is reflected in the fact that expenditure on fixed assets is expected to-be   [ ]million higher in 1962/63 than it was in 1961/62. The   [ ] millionincrease in expenditure on nuclear fuel reflects the expected increase in therate of delivery of fuel as the first nuclear power stations near completion.South of Scotland Electricity Board  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Generation: ; Conventional stations     .........

,-/i 43. The generating, transmission and distribution programme of the SouthVuilf3 of Scotland Electricity Board is designed to keep pace with the continuousrise in demand for electricity in the Board&apos;s district. There is no indication of slackening in this rate of increase. Generating plant at present under construction will add 732 MW to the board&apos;s output capacity ; this is mainly to meet new demand, since only 84 MW of old plant is due to be taken out of commission during the next four years.44. Expenditure on the coal-fired generating station at Kincardine andthe nuclear station at Hunterston accounts for most of the investment ingeneration in 1961/62 and 1962/63. Work on the second half of theKincardine station is proceeding satisfactorily and it is expected that oneturbo-alternator with an output of 188 MW will be commissioned in eachof the years 1962 and 1963, giving the station a total output of 712 MW. Itis expected that the two Hunterston reactors, each with an output of 150 MW,will be commissioned in 1963. The extension (output 56 MW) to theBraehead coal-fired station is expected to be ready for commissioningin the autumn of 1961. Investment in main transmission and distributionprovides principally for the reinforcement of the system to meet the growing demand and includes work on the 275 kV supergrid which is pro-progressing as planned and is expected to be complete by 1963.North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Generation    ............	8-8	7-4	8-7	8-9Main transmission    ...      .........	1-4	10   ,	1-3	1-5Distribution.........      ......	3-2	2-7	2-8	3-1Total   ...	13-4	111	12-8	13-5   :The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board at 31st December 1960 was  191 million.45. The Board&apos;s generating and transmission programme is planned tokeep pace with the increasing demand in the Board&apos;s district and at thesame time to maintain sales to the south of Scotland district. Schemes atpresent under construction will add 571 MW of hydro-electric power to theBoard&apos;s generating capacity, including 400 MW of pumped storage. almost the whole of this new capacity will be required to meet the anticipatedincrease in demand in the Board&apos;s district.46. Expenditure on generation continues to be mainly on the Loch Aweand Strathfarrar schemes (440 MW and 102 MW output) capacity respec-tively) in which troublesome rock conditions are causing some delay. plans to extend the steam generating station at Dundee are being pressed forward.Transmission expenditure is mainly on the 275 kV lines designed to rein-Iforce and extend the existing 132 kV network. It will connect with theSouth of Scotland Electricity Board&apos;s 275 kV grid.

During theyears 1961/62 and 1962/63 provision is made for progress payments byB.O.A.C. during the construction of their fleet of VC10 aircraft and forother possible aircraft requirements; for final payments by B.E.A. ondelivery of the remainder of their Vanguard and Comet IVB fleets; ondelivery of three Argosy freighter aircraft; and for progress paymentsduring the constfuction of their fleet of Tridents.48. The remainder of the Air Corporations&apos; capital expenditure, included under the heading of Other expenditure is on premises, operating ground equipment and on office and commercial equipment and installations.49. The figures for B.O.A.C. compare with the estimates of  33-8 million for 1960/61 and  14-6 million for 1961/62 shown in Cmnd. 1203. Thedifference reflects changes in the aircraft purchasing programme and a shortfall  in estimated expenditure during 1960/61, mainly on spare parts andon plant and equipment. The figures for B.E.A. compare with the estimates of  26-7 million for 1960-61 are  18-5 million for 1961/62 shown in(Cmnd. 1203. The difference is the result of rephasing of payments on aircraft and of a carry over from 1960/61 to the following year of someexpenditure on premises, plant and equipment.

The table shown above is in a revised form which accords withthe Government^ proposals set out in Reorganisation of the NationalisedTransport Undertakings presented to Parliament in December 1960 (cmnd..1248). Under the proposed new organisation of the Commission^ undertaking -ings British Railways and certain associated activities will be placed under aBritish Railways Board, and the other undertakings will be either independ-ent or grouped under a Holding Company. Legislation to bring the proposalsinto effect is now being prepared. .  .51. Expenditure in 1960 exceeded the estimate given in November 1960by  4-3 million ; this was due in the main to the incidence of payments fall-ing earlier than originally foreseen. There are also indications that the Com-mission&apos;s requirements for 1961 may prove to be somewhat greater than theestimate of  175m.52. The 1962 investment allocations for the Commission^ undertakings( 139-6 million for British Railways and associated activities,  37-6 million for other undertakings) has been made after a review of investment needs,carried out in conjunction with the Commission, special regard being paidto the contribution which the new investment will make to securing theultimate objective of viability for the railways.53. The investment proposed for the railways is in accordance with thegeneral technical objectives of the Commission^ modernisation plan. Exten-sion of diesel traction will continue, and investment in 1962 will also cover the provision of improved freight facilities (including marshalling yards), andthe modernisation of track, signalling and rolling stock.   There will also
be considerable expenditure on the electrification of the London MidlandRegion main line from London Do Liverpool and Manchester, which was approved by the Minister of Transport in January 1961. The section betweenManchester and Crewe was completed earlier, and electric services betweenCrewe and Liverpool will start in 1962.54. A large part of proposed expenditure by London Transport will beupon replacing life-expired underground rolling stock and road vehicles(including trolley buses) and upon rehabilitating facilities for the distributionof electric current. The extension of electrification from Rickmansworth toAmersham and Chesham has now been completed.55. The main dock works are for modernising and improving facilities ;(pome expenditure will be incurred on new vessels and port maintenance.Expenditure on road passenger and goods vehicles is largely upon the replace-ment of vehicles ; there will also be minor expenditure on depot facilities.The improvement of selected waterways and associated facilities continues ;T)ut the bulk of expenditure on waterways will be for essential long-termmaintenance.Atomic Energy Authority  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Land and buildings............	17-5	16-4	16-2	14-7Plant and machinery......      ...      ...	19-8	19-3	19-9	17-7Total   ...      ......	37-3	35-7	361	32-4The net boofc value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Atomic energy authority at 31st March 1960 was  270 millions. The fixed assets of the National Institutefor Research in Nuclear Science, valued at cost and with no allowance for depreciation,amounted to  5-6 millions at the same date.56. The figures tabled above include the investment of the Atomic energy authority itself, grants by the Authority for investment by the NationalInstitute for Research in Nuclear Science, and all capital expenditure on theEuropean Nuclear Energy Agency&apos;s project (Dragon) for a high temperaturegas cooled reactor experiment at Winfrith Heath, which is financed by con-tributions from the Authority and the other appropriate bodies of the agency&apos;s member countries. The Authority&apos;s expenditure is financed fromthe Atomic Energy Vote (Class IX, Vote 8).57. With the completion of the Authority&apos;s major production facilities,the new investment programme consists mainly of a variety of smaller research and development projects the rate of progress and cost of which are difficultto estimate closely. The lower figures for 1960/61 and 1961/62 comparedwith those given in November 1960 (Cmd. 1203) and the reduced expenditureforecast for 1962/63 reflect this difficulty and the results of the special reviewof programmes made by the Authority in order to ensure that their demands on the country&apos;s resources were reduced to a minimum consistent with the efficient execution of the task laid upon them.
58. In the research and development field, the development of nuclearreactors, to generate electricity on an economic basis remains the principalobjective. Relatively little new investment expenditure in 1962/63 isrequired for the substantial and continuing work in aid of the current nuclear power programme, which is based on developments of the reactor system in use at Calder Hall. The bulk of the new expenditure will be on the more advanced reactor systems under development for the next generation of nuclear power stations. These include the advanced gas cooled reactorprototype at wind scale, the experimental fast reactor at Dounreay and theDragon project at Winfrith Heath. Additional facilities will also be provided to meet the increasingly exacting requirements of fundamental research,including the build up of the Culham Laboratories for the purpose of experi-ments directed towards establishing the conditions for the magnetic contain-ment of plasma for thermo-nuclear power generation.59. Some investment for production will be made, mainly to provide plant for the examination and chemical reprocessing of fuel elements when theyare discharged from the nuclear power stations under construction for theElectricity Boards and overseas countries.60. The major expenditure by the National Institute for Research inNuclear Service will continue to be on the construction at the RutherfordLaboratory, Harwell, of the 7GeV proton synchrotron (Nimrod) andassociated facilities which will be used by universities and other bodies for research into nuclear structures. Among the other items is part of the provi-sion needed for purchase of an &quot; Atlas &quot; electronic digital computer.Post Office  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Postal				Plant and machinery       .........	0-7	0-7	1-1	1-7Accommodation services.........	5-0	4-8	60	6-5Motor transport   ............	0-7	11	1-3	1-1Telecommunications				Plant, machinery and ships        ......	78-1	82-5	85-4	94-8Accommodation services.........	9-5	9-3	11-6	12-6Motor transport    ............	0-4	1-3	1-6	1-3Total         ............	94-4	99-7	107-0	1180The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Post Office at 31st March1961 was  870 million.61. Under the provisions of the Post Office Act, 1961, the finances of thePost Office have been made independent of the Exchequer ; but the Post office will continue to borrow from the Exchequer, within a ceiling authorised byParliament, for such of its investment as is not financed from internalresources.62. The Post Office figures now include expenditure on furniture and officemachinery formerly included in the programmes of the Ministry of Works andthe Stationery Office. In addition, certain categories of expenditure havebeen transferred from current to capital account. These changes entail a small increase in the figures shown in Cmnd. 1203. The figures in the table exclude
26Post Office expenditure in&apos;&apos;Northern Ireland, on the provision of televisionlinks for the BBC and ITA (for which see paragraph 64) and in connectionwith road improvement works.63. A survey of current Post Office (plans was included in the White PaperPost Office Prospects 1961 j62 (Cmnd. 1327), presented to Parliament in March,1961. The main objectives for the telephone service are to complete by 1970the conversion of the remaining 800 manual exchanges to automatic working ;to extend subscriber trunk dialling to nearly all telephones toy the same date ;to expand the system to meet traffic growth (especially in the trunk service) andnew demands for telephone service; and to expand the submarine cable net-work and experiment with such developments as satellite communications.Investment is also required in the telex and private telegraph services, whichare expanding. Investment in plant and machinery for the postal service is largely for the developing needs of postal mechanisation.Other Public Corporations  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63British Broadcasting Corporation......	4-4	4-2	5-8	6-4Independent Television Authority ...	0-7	1-4	2-0	1-7Covent Garden Market Authority......	&apos;-&apos;	. -.	4 0	20Total   ............	5-1	5-6	11-8	10 164. Investment by the British Broadcasting Corporation is financed from the broadcasting Vote (Class IV, Vote 13) ; the greater part is for the HomeServices, for which the amount of the Vote is related to licence revenue.Provision is mainly for the extension and improvement of coverage of the television and very high frequency sound broadcasting services, and for new and improved buildings and equipment.65. Investment by the Independent Television Authority is financed fromthe Authority&apos;s own resources ; it has the object of extending coverage and improving reception. The figures for both the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. includethe cost of the work undertaken by the Post Office for the provision of tele-vision links.66. The Covent Garden Market Authority was formed in 1961 to acquire the market and properties at present belonging to Covent Garden Market Ltd.Since the Authority may be unable to meet all its initial commitments out ofrevenue or to raise on its own credit the capital it needs, the Covent GardenMarket Act, 1961, provides that the Authority may borrow up to  8 million from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food during the period ending10 years from the date the Authority takes over the Market. The authority is expected to spend about  4-0 million in 1961/62 mostly on the acquisition ofproperty. Further expenditure will depend upon the Authority&apos;s plans but istentatively estimated to amount to  2 million in 1962/63.67. The Scottish Special Housing Association and the New Town Develop-sment Corporations are treated as local authorities for the purpose of this white paper on the grounds that their functions are similar to those of a local
authority. Investment by the iScottish Special Housing Association and invest-\jf fciment by the New Town Development Corporations in housing is included inthe housing programme (page ). Other investment by the New town development Corporations is included in the sewerage programme (page )and in other investment by local authorities (paragraph      ).Roads  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales Motorways ...     ......     ......

Capital expenditure on unclassified roads and on all formsof road lighting is included in the table of other investment by localauthorities (page ).69. The Ministry of Transport in England and Wales and the scottish home Department in Scotland are responsible for the building of trunk roads and motorways on trunk routes; the expenditure is met entirely fromExchequer funds (Class IX, Votes 2 and 10). The local authorities areresponsible for the building of classified roads and the expenditure is metpartly by the local authorities themselves and partly from Exchequer grants.70. The figures for 1962/63 reflect the increases in expenditure on theroad programme announced on 2nd August 1961 (House of CommonsOfficial Report, Cols. 169, 173 and 199). Over the five years ending 1966/67approximately  540 million is to be spent in England and Wales and  67\million in Scotland.
71. In England and Wales, much of the work will be on five major ^projects designed to improve the main trunk network. These are the build- ( \ing of the London Preston and London South Wales motorway and the modernisation of the Great North Road and of the roads between - theMidlands and South Wales and between London and the Channel Ports.The aim is substantially to complete these five major projects by the middle1960&apos;s and also to start work on the extension of the M.1 motorway toYorkshire in the same period. On classified roads, the main efforts willbe devoted to the relief of urban congestion. The improvement of manytrunk roads is to foe accelerated.72. In Scotland the emphasis in the past has been on classified road schemes but &apos;the reconstruction of the main trunk routes is now to be accelerated. Of total planned expenditure in the five years ending 1966/67 38J million is to toe devoted to trunk roads and  29 (million to exchequer grants for classified road schemes. During this period the reconstruction of the Glasgow Carlisle and Glasgow Stirling routes will be completed ;the reconstruction of the Glasgow Edinburgh road will be well in handand a start will foe made on the Edinburgh Stirling and Inverkeithing Perth trunk roads. The Forth bridge and Clyde tunnels will be completed and there will be higher expenditure on the Highland road programme.University Grants Committee  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Land and buildings   .........      ...	17-3	16-5	20-3	21-plant and equipment          .........	2-7	3-9	50	5-6Total   ............	200	20-4	25-3	27-073. Funds are voted annually by Parliament (Class IV, Vote 12) for exchequer grants to the universities. These include capital (or &quot; non-recurrent &quot;) grants for the erection of new, and the adaption of existing,buildings ; the payment of professional fees; equipment for new aecommoda-tion; and the purchase of sites and properties.74. For the most part investment (and the Exchequers commitments for non-recurrent grant) is subject to a limit on the total value of new building work to foe started in each calendar year; within these limits,allocations between universities are made by the University Grants Com-mittee. For 1961, the limit is  15 million. As announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 25th January 1961 (House of Commons Official Report,Cols. 31-32), the intention is to authorise the starting of new building workto the value of  25 million in each of 1962 and 1963 (i.e. increases of 10 million a year over the figures previously authorised) and for the calendar years 1964 and 1965 the University Grants Committee have been authorised to invite the universities to make building plans on a basis ofstarts of  30 million in each year. The rates at which these plans canfoe carried out must depend on the general state of the national economy and on factors such as building costs.
75. Investment in 1961/62 and 1962/63, includes expenditure on-new buildings for science and&apos; technology and on halls of residence ; there willalso be expenditure on the scheme for expanding the Imperial College of science and Technology and on accommodation for dental and medical schools in teaching hospitals (investment under these heads is controlledseparately). Details of schemes in progress, and of schemes due to startin the current year, are given in Appendix A to the 1961/62 Estimates.Education  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales Buildings: Primary and secondary schools Further education       .........

The greater part of this public investment in education is undertaken by local education authorities, working within overall limits administered bythe Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. Thecapital expenditure by local education authorities is, for the most part,financed by borrowing, and the loan charges together with capital expenditure from revenue are taken into account in fixing the general grant.77. In England and Wales the renewed rise in expenditure on school building expected between 1960/61 and 1962/63 is largely attributable toabout  120 million of new work on major projects which is likely to startin the two years 1960/62 compared with  93 million started in the immediately preceding two years. This is the first instalment of the pro-gramme of  300 million over five years, announced in the White PaperSecondary Education for All a new Drive (Cmnd. 604), presented toParliament in December 1958. In addition to a considerable amount of new building needed on account of increases or shifts of population, the five-year programme will complete the elimination of all-age schools, and over three-quarters of the building needed for this is included in the work proposed for the three years ending in 1962/63. It will also permit a start to bemade in modernising or replacing old schools. About half of our children are attending schools built before the 1914-18 war, many of which provideconditions well below modern standards.78. Investment in further education is mainly for building new colleges and major extensions. Special emphasis is being given to the expansion of facilities for advanced technological education and for the part-time education
30of craftsmen and technicians. The White Paper Technical Education, (cmnd.. *9703), presented to Parliament in February 1956, announced a building ^programme of  70 million in England and Wales for the five years 1956 to1961. Work on the whole of this programme was started on time. a slightly higher rate of starts is expected for the years 1961/62 and 1962/63.This allows for increases in building costs and for building at local authorities&apos;farm institutes for which departmental responsibility has been transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Ministry ofEducation ; the figure for 1960/61 also reflects this transfer.79. The most important element in the increase in building expenditureon other services is a steep rise in investment in facilities for teacher training.The capacity of the training colleges will be increased by 12,000 placesby September 1962. All the work on expansion by another 12,000 placeswill have started by the middle 1960&apos;s.80. In consequence of the recommendations of the Albemarle Committee(Cmnd. 929) presented to Parliament in February 1960, extra provision is included in the period 1960/63 for investment in the youth service. Work,costing  3 million will be started in the two year period 1960/62.81. As part of the Governomenfs measures to restrain the growth of public expenditure and capital investment announced by the Chancellor of theExchequer on 25th July 1961 (House of Commons Official Report, col. 223),the starts of minor projects in England and Wales in the eighteen monthsperiod beginning on 1st October 1961 will be restricted to  16 million com-pared with  16-5 million previously authorised for the financial year&quot;1961/62.This accounts for the reduction in the expenditure on other services and minor projects in 1961/62 compared with the estimate made in November1960 (Cmnd. 1203).82. In Scotland the pattern of investment is broadly similar to that inEngland and Wales. The provision for school building is based on thefive-year programme envisaged in the White Paper &quot; Education in Scotland-The Next Step &quot; (Cmnd. 603), presented to Parliament in December 1958.Expenditure on further education is rising rather more steeply in Scotlandbecause the programme of investment in Scottish technical education inScotland which was announced in the 1956 White Paper took longer to getunder way than was expected. As part of the measures to restrain thegrowth of public expenditure and capital investment referred to in thepreceding paragraph investment on Schools in the financial year 1961/62will be restricted to  118m. compared with the estimate of  13-4m. givenin November 1960 (Cmnd. 1202).Housing  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales............

The housing programme covers investment in houses and other types of dwellings by local authorities, housing associations (including the Scottish
Special Housing Association) and new town development corporations. In-vestment in dwellings for the employees of the public sector, for examplepolice housing, is not included ; provision for this is made under the respectiveprogrammes. In addition to new building the housing programme includes the cost of the acquisition of land and buildings and of improvementscarried out by local authorities and housing associations to their owndwellings.84. Investment is mostly financed by borrowing. Borrowing by localauthorities is subject to the issue of loan sanction by the Ministry of housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland. housing associations, in certain circumstances, may borrow from local authoritiesto finance their investment and in addition, in order to encourage theprovision of unsubsidised dwellings for letting, statutory authority is being sought to enable the Minister of Housing and Local Government to make advances to associations who have entered into an agreement with him forthis purpose. The investment of the Scottish Special Housing association and new town development corporations is, financed directly from theExchequer, as explained in Government Expenditure Below The Linepresented to Parliament in April 1961.  (Cmnd. 1338.)85. The annual charges in respect of dwellings, that is to say the costof maintenance, management, debt interest on loans etc., are financed inEngland and Wales as to about 71 per cent, by rents, 6 per cent, by ratefund subsidies and 23 per cent, by Exchequer subsidies payable underthe Housing Acts. In Scotland the figures are 32 per cent., 35 percent, and 33 per cent, respectively. Almost all Exchequer subsidies takethe form of fixed annual payment in respect of each of the qualifying housecompleted, usually payable over 60 years thereafter.86. The proportion in which expenditure, and consequently physicalresources, is distributed in any one year between dwellings completed,dwellings started and dwellings under construction, that is to say whetheravailable resources are devoted to making relatively rapid progress on theconstruction of relatively few dwellings or to making slower progress onthe construction of a larger number &apos;of dwellings, turns largely on the numberof dwellings under construction at the beginning of the year and the numberstarted during the period. At the end of 1960 the number of dwellingsunder construction in the public sector in England and Wales was ratherlower than at the end of 1959 ; the number of tenders approved duringI960 was also smaller than during the previous year. In the first sixmonths of 1961 there was a slight increase both in number of dwellingsstarted and in tenders approved ; but completions fell significantly belowthe rate for 1960, with the result that at the end of June the number of dwellings under construction was markedly higher than a year earlier.The general pressure on the building and civil engineering industry was thus being reflected in the output of public sector dwellings.87. In order to allow the volume of work in hand to return to more normal levels and thus enable the numbers under construction to be more rapidly completed it has been decided that starts in England and wales should be held back, in the months immediately ahead. At the same time it is important to avoid the reappearance of the overload of orders on thebuilding industry which would be the effect of holding back starts if therate at which contracts were let were not also reduced. Housing authoritieshave therefore been urged to exercise restraint in putting projects out to tender.
Difficulty has in any case been experienced in letting contracts in certain areas (and the present level of costs at interest rates may also be expectedto hold down the rate at which projects are put out to tender). there seems therefore a good prospect that over the next few months the numberof orders outstanding and houses under construction will gradually bereduced, completions will speed up and the average time taken to build a house, which has been lengthening ever since the beginning of 1960,will start shortening again.88. It is difficult to say what effect these, processes will have on the startsand completions during 1961/62 and 1962/63 as a whole, since a very greatdeal depends on how far the process of readjustment will have workeditself out by the end of the current financial year; but it seems unlikelythat in England and Wales there will be any very great change in theamount of investment expenditure, in real terms, between the two years.89. In Scotland where the building industry is not under the same pressureas in England and Wales, house building by local authorities is expected,on present trends, to continue to decline in 1962/63. Restriction on localauthorities&apos; programmes will not be necessary unless an unexpected trenddevelops.Water and Sewerage  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales				Water        .........      ......	28-5	28-5	37-4	43-3Sewerage    ...............	36-8	38-9	48-9	53-6Total......      ......	65-3	67-4	86-3	96-scotland				Water       ...............	4-6	5-9	60	5-3Sewerage    ...............	2-7	2-8	2-5	3-7Total   ............	7-3	8-7	8-5	9090. These figures are of investment by local water boards and authoritiesand local sewerage authorities including new towns development corpora-tions ; they do not include investment by private water companies.91. The work carried out is for the most part financed by loan. Forborrowing, the boards and authorities in England and Wales require loansanction from the Minister of Housing and Local Government, unlessborrowing powers have been obtained under a private Act of Parliament,and in all cases in Scotland loan sanction is required from the Secretaryof State for Scotland. To assist certain schemes in rural areas and develop-ment districts grants are paid by the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Department of Health for Scotland under the RuralWater Supplies and Sewerage Acts and the Local Employment Act, 1960(Class V, Votes 1 and 9).92. In England and Wales the provisional estimate of expenditure in1960/61 is considerably lower than the estimate of  82 million given inNovember 1960 (cmnd.. 1203). This fall is largely the result of bad weather in 1960, which slowed down greatly the progress of work on water and sewerage schemes. The forecast out-itum of expenditure in 1961/62, althoughlower than the estimate made in November 1960, is a closer assessment
of the amount of work likely to be carried out and does not represent a slowing down in the rate of essential investment in water and sewerageschemes. Local authorities have, however, been asked by the Governmentto help restrain the rapid growth of expenditure on these services bydeferring applications for loan sanction for schemes which are not immediately necessary.93. In Scotland the estimate of expenditure in 1960/61 and the forecast of expenditure in 1961/62 are also somewhat lower than the estimates givenin November 1960 (Cmnd. 1203). These reductions are largely due to certainschemes having taken longer to plan and prepare than had originally been expected and also, in 1961/62, to the likelihood that certain schemes willbe postponed in view of the present need to restrict the expansion of capitalexpenditure.94. The large schemes for which provision is made in 1961/62 and 1962/63are as shown in Cmnd. 1203. In England and Wales these include improve-ments for the water supply to the Cardiff, Liverpool and Manchester Corpora-tions, to Tyneside and to the West Riding of Yorkshire; in Scotland they include improvements to the water supply in the counties of Angus andKincardine, Perth and Clackmannan, West Lothian, and the whole ofindustrial Lanarkshire. In addition, in England and Wales, work is dueto start in 1962/63&quot;on the Balderhead Reservoir scheme for the Tees Valleyand Cleveland.95. Sewerage and sewage disposal schemes for which provision is madein 1961/62 and 1962/63 include continued reconstruction of the manchester corporation works and of the works dealing with much of the domestic and industrial wastes from Birmingham and neighbouring districts,&apos; large scale extensions of the Coventry Corporation sewage treatment works and important drainage and sewerage schemes at Poole and Weston^super-Mare.These last two schemes will help to improve the conditions of the beaches intheir area, as will smaller schemes at Bridlington, Sheringham, Bournemouth,Dymchuroh and Worthing. Schemes in Scotland include the modernisation of the Falkirk works, comprehensive schemes at Grangemouth and Kirkin-tilloch, new works primarily to serve large industrial developments in WestLothian and Renfrewshire, and a joint scheme serving Alloa and part ofClackmannanshire.Local Authority Health and Welfare Services  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales Health: Mental health services.........

: 96. These programmes are the responsibility, of local authorities whoseexpenditure is financed mainly by borrowing, within allocations administered by the Ministry of Health or the Department of Health for Scotland, butalso from their revenues. ...97. Over the years a rising level of investment in England and wales has reflected the expansion of the local authority health and welfare services,especially those for the care in the community of the mentally disordered andthose required to meet the steady growth in the demand for residentialhomes for the elderly. By far the greater part of the investment in the welfare services represents new development; but some progress is also being made on the replacement of unsuitable premises, such as former PublicAssistance Institutions still in use as homes for old people.98. In Scotland expenditure is on the same lines as in England and Walesexcept that local authorities are not responsible for the Ambulance service or, to the same extent, for training centres for mentally handicapped children.The provision for the expansion of mental health services is expected to begin somewhat later than in England and Wales, where legislation wasenacted earlier.Hospital Services  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63England and Wales Hospitals: Major projects............

Subject in all cases to the direction of the Minister of Health or theSecretary of State for Scotland, capital expenditure on hospitals is administered by Regional Hospital Boards, except for teaching hospitals in England and Wales, where the Boards of Governors are responsible. Theexpenditure is financed through the National Health Service Votes (Class V,Votes 5 and 10).::.....L-.....;............................S--------...........28-. - -.....-----...........---.....-
100. The main aims continue to foe to modernise the hospital servicetoy replacing obsolete accommodation ; to touild new hospitals where requiredby movements of population or for rationalisation and economy ; to provideup-to-date teaching facilities ; and to keep abreast of advances in medicalscience.102. New arrangements for the planning and execution of the hospitalprogramme were announced by the Minister of Health in January and february 1961 (House of Commons official report 25th January 1961, Col.33-35 and 8th February, Col. 429) and toy the Secretary of State for scotland on 1st February 1961 (House of Commons official report 1st February 1961,Col. 140-142). Hospital authorities in England and Wales have been askedto draw up plans for new building starts over a period of 10 years affectingbuilding work over a period of 15 years. To help the authorities to make this forward assessment, they have been given tentative planning limitsbased on expenditure rising to about  50 million in 1965/66, the implement a-tion and phasing of plans being kept under review toy the Government inthe course of the annual reviews of public investment. In Scotland a provisional selection of the major hospital projects to be undertaken up to1970 has been agreed with the Scottish Regional Hospital Boards.103. Details of the many large hospital schemes now in progress are givenin Appendix A to the National Health Service Votes in the 1961 /62 Estimates.&quot;Among the new schemes planned to start in England and Wales during1962/63 are a new hospital at Wythenshawe, Manchester, a new dentalhospital at King&apos;s College, London, the second phases of new hospitalsat Huddersfield and Swansea, and a new radiotherapy centre at Sheffield.Other new schemes are at Coldeast Hospital, Southampton, and the WesternGeneral Hospital, Hull. Scottish schemes include the main stage of theNew Victoria, Kirkoaldy, new hospitals in Skye and Islay and furtherextensions at Ladysbridge Hospital, Banff, and the Royal Scottish NationalInstitution, Larbert.Other Investment by the Central Government  million	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63Agriculture and fishing       ...      ......	1-5	1-6	1-7	2-3Forestry Commission............	2-7	3-4	3-3	3-4Government buildings        .........	8-7	12-2	13-5	15-0Factory building      ............	5-5	7-0	8-0	100Civil aerodromes services    .........	3-3	4-7	6-3	7-5Ministry of Aviation civil research, and				development......     .........	1-7	1-3	1-3	1-2Harbours      ...............	0-1	0-1	0-2	0-4Oil storage and distribution.........	0-7	0-4	0-5	0-civil defence...............	0-8	0-9	0-8	0-6Prisons..................	2 0	3-4	5-2	5-other Home Office and Scottish Home				Department services       ......	0-8	0-8	0-7	0-9Department of Scientific and Industrial				Research	1-1	1-5	2-5	3-0Stationery Office      ............	1-3	2-5	3 1	2-8Grant-aided bodies   ............	0-4	0-7	1-4	1-5Total   ............					30-6	40-5	48-5 .	55-0
103. Almost all this investment is financed from the appropriate depart-mental votes.104. Investment in agriculture and fishing is administered by the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture andFisheries for Scotland (Class VIII, Votes 3, 5, 11 and 12). It includesexpenditure undertaken by the Agricultural Land Commission and LandSettlement Associations on the Ministry&apos;s behalf ; investment by the ministry and Department in research institutes, experimental husbandry farms,horticulture stations and fishery research vessels ; investment by the Depart-ment in agricultural colleges and arterial drainage; and investment by the herring Industry Board. In 1962/63 provision is made for first instalmentson the purchase of three vessels by the Department for charter to theMacBrayne Steamer Service.105. Investment expenditure by the Forestry Commission is mainly on theconstruction of forest roads and the replacement of obsolete vehicles (ClassVIII, Vote 10).106. Expenditure on Government buildings is borne on the Ministry ofWorks Votes (Class VII, Votes 2, 3, 5 and 6). Current projects are setout in Part HI of these Votes in the 196T/62 Estimates and include thereconstruction of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street and the old Treasurybuilding in Whitehall, the construction of the new road research laboratoryat Crowthorne for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research andthe acquisition of the Bridge Street Parliament Street site for development.107. Factory building comprises expenditure by the Board of Trade (ClassVI, Vote 4) on land and buildings, in 1959/60 under the Distribution ofIndustry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and in subsequent years under the local employment Act, 1960. The figures for 1960/61 and later years include expenditure on projects for the motor industry in Scotland, in Wales andon Merseyside.108. The main projects for which provision is made in the Ministry of aviation&apos;s expenditure on civil aerodrome services (Class VI, Vote 10)are at London (Heathrow) Airport, the continuation of work on thelong-haul terminal building, the extension of freight handling capacity, theextension of aprons, and the construction of a multi-story car park, and, at prestwick, the construction of the new terminal building, aprons and taxi-ways. There will also be substantial expenditure on the extension of air traffic Control systems.109. The Ministry of Aviation&apos;s investment in civil research and develop-ment represents part of the expenditure (Class VI, Vote 9) as capitalfacilities for aeronautical and other research carried out in the Ministry&apos;sestablishments and for the Ministry in industry.110. Expenditure on harbours by the Ministry of Transport (Class IX,Vote 3) covers the provision of emergency facilities at various ports and capital expenditure at Faslane Port in Scotland.111. Expenditure on oil storage and distribution is by the Ministry of power (Class IX, Vote 6) for the provision of emergency facilities.
112. Expenditure on civil defence is by the Home Office and scottish home Department (Class III, Votes 2 and 14). The fall in investment in1962/63 corresponds with progress in the building programme for the warn-ing and monitoring system ; this is nearing completion. Investment by localauthorities in civil defence is expected to increase in 1962/63 (see paragraph127).113. Expenditure on prisons is financed from the Prison Commission and scottish Home Department Prison Votes (Class III, Votes 4 and 16). TheGovernments plans for penal reform were set out in the White paper on Penal Practice in a Changing Society (Cmad. 645), presented to parliament in February 1959. The programme includes new prisons, borstals, detention centres and wholly new types of establishments such as remand centres and a psychiatric establishment. It also includes new or improved quarters for prison staff.114. The other investment expenditure by the Home Office and scottish home Department is on a miscellany of items which include the policecolleges and training centres, a fire service training school in Scotland, theprovision of wireless equipment for the police and fire services and onlicensed and ancillary premises in the State Management Districts.115. Expenditure by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.(Class IX, Vote 9) is on capital equipment for the Departments own use and for the use of universities and others. Expenditure on buildings forthe Departments own use is borne on the Ministry of Works Votes (seeparagraph 106).116. Investment by the Stationery Office (Class VII, Vote ) is mainly on office machinery, including computers, for the government service (officemachinery purchased by the Post Office is now included in the Post office programme (paragraph 62).117. The grant-aided bodies whose investment is shown in the tablecomprise the Medical Research Council, the College of Aeronautics, the agriculture Research Council, the Nature Conservancy and national museums and galleries not included in the Government Buildings programme (para-graph 106). Figures of expenditure by these bodies were not included in cmnd. 1203. (See Appendix I.) Expenditure by certain other grant aidedbodies is shown under other headings.

For the most part this investment is financial from local authorities&apos;internal resources or toy borrowing; some items attract specific government grant.119. Expenditure on road passenger transport is mainly upon the purchaseof vehicles for local authority bus fleets, but also upon the construction ofgarages, bus stations and shelters.120. The (figures for car parks include expenditure upon four multi-storybuildings (two in London, two in Coventry) already under construction. Thefuture demand for both multi-story and surface car parks is expected toincrease.121. About half the investment in municipal aerodromes in 1962/63 willbe for extensions of terminal buildings, runways, aprons and car parks at manchester and Birmingham. The rest of the investment is spread overfifteen municipal aerodromes.122. Investment in docks and harbours is carried out by port, dock and harbour authorities. These are mainly independent statutory public trustsbut some are under the control of local councils. All are financed from internal sources or by borrowing. Similar expenditure by the B.T.C. is included in the table on page . The figures in Cmnd. 1203, did not include the expenditure by independent authorities (see the footnote to paragraph 10).123. Expenditure on unclassified roads and road lighting is additional to the expenditure upon roads within the road programme shown on page
, It includes expenditure on trunk, road lighting, which was shown in Cmnd.*&apos;f 1203 under the road programme. More than half of total expenditure underthis heading in England and Wales is upon the replacement of obsoletestreet lighting in conurbations.124. Expenditure on the police and fire services is increasing. Manyexisting stations are in need of modernisation, and it is also necessary tomake provision for new stations to match movements of population and toreplace those to be demolished in connection with comprehensive urban development schemes. The emphasis in the future is therefore likely to beon operational buildings, though the recent level of investment in housingwill be maintained..125. Expenditure under the Town and Country Planning Acts is chieflyupon the redevelopment of war damaged and blighted areas. Expenditureih 1961/62 is now expected to be substantially higher than was estimated in November 1960. The main reasons for this increase and for the further increase forecast for 1962/63 are the rise in land prices, the increasing rateof urban redevelopment and the building of factories by local authorities for/the purposes of the Local Employment Aot, 1960, the Town development act, 1952, and the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957.126. The greater part of investment under the head of agriculture, fishing,arterial drainage and sea defence, is upon arterial drainage and slaughter-houses. These items account for about one-half and one-quarter of totalexpenditure respectively. Other expenditure is upon smallholdings, ruralroads and cattle markets. Most of the expenditure on slaughterhouses is inconsequence of the Slaughterhouses Aot, 1958.127. Expenditure on civil defence is divided almost equally between theprovision of training facilities and the establishment of a system of operational control centres. The increase in estimated expenditure in 1961/62 and1962/63 is mainly the result of development of the scheme of emergencycontrol.128. The expenditure on new towns shown here is by new town develop-ment corporations upon the provision of factories, offices and. shops ;expenditure upon houses and sewerage is included in the main programmesunder these headings. Expenditure is financed by borrowing from theExchequer under the New Towns Act, 1946.129. General services include coast -protection works and the provisionof town halls and offices, libraries and museums, swimming baths and recreation grounds, cemeteries and crematoria, court buildings and approvedschools, markets, and vehicles and equipment for refuse collection and streetCleansing ; the figures for Scotland include expenditure upon slaughterhouses,river purification and flood prevention schemes also. Investment in these services was restricted for a considerable time after the war in favour ofmore urgent needs, such as housing; but in recent years it has increasedconsiderably and in 1960/61 it was running at a higher level than in any year since the war. A further increase is expected in 1961/62 but, as explained on page , the Government has sought the cooperation oflocal authorities in imposing restraint upon the growth of expenditure onthese services.
APPENDIXNotes on definitions1. This White Paper is concerned with civil public gross fixed capital formation inGreat Britain. Except that sales of land and fixed assets are not deducted, the definition of gross fixed capital formation is the same as that used in the national income and Expenditure Blue Book, as explained in National Income Statistics :Sources and Methods, published by H.M. Stationery Office. It comprises expenditureon replacement of, and additions and major improvements to, fixed capital assetslocated in Great Britain. Fixed assets are land, buildings, civil engineering works(e.g., roads, reservoirs, drainage works, etc.), vehicles, ships and aircraft, plant and machinery. The word &quot; fixed &quot; denotes the exclusion of changes in stocks (if any),and &quot; gross&quot; that no allowance is made for depreciation. Ships and aircraft,wherever based, are included if owned by public authorities in Great Britain.2. Most of the figures for expenditure on the individual programmes are for the accouting years of the authorities concerned. The South of Scotland electricity board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board work to a calendar year;and the accounting year of the National Coal Board ends on the Saturday nearestto 31st December: but the figures given in this White Paper are for financial years(1st April-31st March). The British Transport Commission also works to a calendar year and in the Table on page 00 a timing adjustment is included to produce figuresfor financial years.3. The figures for civil public gross fixed capital formation in this White Paperexclude capital formation in Northern Ireland and by the iron and steel companiesstill in public ownership, and include capital formation by certain private bodiesfinanced from public funds e.g. by the University Grants Committee. In the BlueBook, the figures for the public sector include Northern Ireland and these iron andsteel companies; exclude private capital formation financed from public funds and are for calendar years.4. In Public Investment in Great Britain (Cmnd. 1203) capital expenditure on theRoyal Ordnance Factories and on married quarters and land for the Armed forces was included as public investment. In this White Paper all expenditure on land,buildings (including married quarters) and equipment for the Armed Forces is excluded. Expenditure by public authorities on buildings and plant for research on,and development and manufacture of, arms and equipment for the Forces (including expenditure on admiralty dockyards and research establishments and on the royal ordnance factories) is also excluded; but expenditure on land, buildings and equip-ment for civil defence is included.5. Some other small changes have been made in this White Paper to the coverageadopted in Public Investment in Great Britain (Cmnd. 1203). Investment by certainport and harbour authorities and grant aided bodies not previously taken into account has been included. All investment by the main grant aided bodies treated as part ofthe central Government in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods is nowrecorded.6. In this White Paper local authorities have been defined as all bodies covered bythe provisions of Part XI of the Local Government Act, 1933, and Part XIII of theLocal Government (Scotland) Act, 1947. The Socttish Special Housing association and the new town development corporations, which are defined as public corporations in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods are treated as local authorities inthat their junctions are closer to those of a local authority than to those normallyassociated with a public corporation (see page 00).7. Changes in expenditure charged to capital account by the National Coal Boardand the Post Office are referred to in paragraphs 29 and 62 of this White Paper.8.
