(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 153 COPY NO.6th October, 1961CABINETCOMMONWEALTH MIGRANTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home DepartmentWhen the Cabinet last considered this subject on 30th May, 1961, they invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Commonwealth MigrantsCommittee to give further consideration to the practicability of controllingimmigration to the United Kingdom from other parts of the Commonwealth(C. C. (61) 29th Conclusions, Minute 7).    At a recent meeting over whichI presided in the absence of the Lord Chancellor, the Committeeconfirmed their earlier conclusion that it was both practicable and necessary to introduce legislation controlling Commonwealth immigration;and they approved for submission to the Cabinet, subject to some revision,the draft of a Bill for that purpose.    The draft Bill attached to this paper has been approved by the Legislation Committee, subject to furtherconsideration of some points of detail which are noted in paragraph 13below.2.     The scale of coloured immigration is already very high and is rapidly increasing.     The latest monthly figure available, for August, isthe highest on record at 15, 700;  and the estimated total for 1961 is well over 100, 000 as compared with 57, 700 for I960 and 21, 000 for 1959.    Thegreat bulk of coloured immigrants have always come from the west indies but the Indian sub-continent is now a fairly close second:  for someyears the Indian and Pakistani Governments were able to exercisereasonably effective controls on emigration to the United Kingdom but these no longer appear to be achieving their purpose, while the west indian Governments have never felt able to impose any kind of effective control.    The case for control by Her Majesty&apos;s Government rests mainlyupon two considerations - the strain imposed by coloured immigration onthe housing resources of certain local authorities and.the dangers of socialtension inherent in the existence of large unas similated colouredcommunities.    The Commonwealth Migrants Committee recognise that control would represent a departure from the long-standing freedom of all british subjects to enter and stay in the United Kingdom;  thatunrestricted Commonwealth immigration is on balance to our economic advantage; that control cannot at present be conclusively justified on grounds of employment, health or public order;  and that its introductionwould give rise to sharp criticism in some Commonwealth countries andfierce controversy in Parliament.    Nevertheless, taking full accountof all the arguments on both sides, the Committee recommend that, sinceassimilation is not taking place to any significant extent while colouredimmigration seems likely to go on increasing, control should be accepted as a sad necessity.SEG1IT
Character of the Proposed Control3. The scheme comprised in the Bill is a flexible employment controlapplying, broadly, to Commonwealth citizens not either born in the UnitedKingdom or holding valid passports issued by the United Kingdom Govern-ment. The central feature of the scheme is that entry would depend uponpossession of a voucher issued by the Ministry of Labour, which would forthis purpose recognise three categories of applicant:-(c)    Others.The intention is that vouchers should be issued freely to persons in categories (a) and (b);  and to persons in category (c) on the principle of&quot;first come, first served&quot; within numerical limits determined by theGovernment from time to time in the light of all relevant factors - socialeconomic, etc.    The Bill provides that entry may not be refused to anyone who can support himself without working and entry would, of course,continue to be granted unconditionally to persons of certain other types,such as genuine students.    On the other hand, the Bill applies to allwould-be immigrants provision that entry may be refused to anyone onspecified grounds of health, criminal record or national security.4.      The great merit of this scheme is that it can be presented asmaking no distinction on grounds of race or colour, although in practiceall would-be immigrants from the old Commonwealth countries would almost certainly be able to obtain authority to enter under eithercategory (a) or category (b).    We must recognise that, although thescheme purports to relate solely to employment and to be non-discriminatory, its aim is primarily social and its restrictive effect i sintended to, and would in fact, operate on coloured people almost exclusively.     This will be seen and, no doubt, laboured by some of ourcritics  but there is no escape from it and at least such critics will notbe able to sustain any suggestion that the scheme is inherentlydiscriminatory.    The Commonwealth Migrants Committee are agreed thatwe should resist any attempt to write into the Bill provision againstdiscrimination on grounds of race or colour.    On the other hand, thescheme will not necessarily produce an immediate or dramatic reductionin coloured immigration:  its impact will largely depend upon our decisions as a Government about the numbers to be admitted in category (c).    Someof our own supporters may therefore well be far from satisfied, but weCan probably hope for no better situation than one not wholly pleasingto our critics at either extreme.5.      The Commonwealth Migrants Committee are satisfied that, if wewere to join the European Economic Community,  the freedom of citizens of other countries in the Community to come here would remain subject to(a)Those having jobs to go to.(b)Those who have undergone apprenticeship or training,or have professional or educational qualificationsor experience, accepted as likely to be useful inthis country.
administrative control which need be no more liberal than the proposedsystem of control for Commonwealth citizens.Other Features of the Dill6.      Landing Conditions..    An important aspect of the Bill is that itdifferentiates between Commonwealth citizens and aliens by not imposingupon the former a universal requirement to obtain leave to land.    On theother hand, the Bill authorises Immigration Officers to grant entrysubject to conditions and in consequence to require landing and embarkationcards.    It seems prudent to have these additional powers, if only in reserve.    Despite the best efforts of Immigration Officers the scheme is bound to cause some additional delay to all arriving at the sea and airports used by Commonwealth immigrants, but this is an unavoidabledisadvantage of any scheme for controlling Commonwealth immigration.7.      The Bill gives powers, comparable to those under the Aliens Order,to require the master, commander, owners or agents of a ship or aircraft to take back persons refused admission.     This is essential as a deterrent to any who might be tempted to bring large numbers of immigrants to thiscountry without Ministry of Labour vouchers.8.      Appeals.     It is inevitable that Immigration Officers should be givenwide discretion and that their decisions to grant or refuse entry shouldhave immediate effect.     The Commonwealth Migrants Committee are agreed that it would not be practicable to provide for appeals againstrefusal but there will be administrative arrangements whereby on occasions of doubt Immigration Officers can rapidly refer individual cases to the Home Office for confirmation.9*     jrish Citizens.    As drafted, the Bill applies to citizens of theIrish Republic, but the Commonwealth Migrants Committee are agreedthat control of entry from Ireland is not in fact practicable.    Since in thelast analysis the proposed control would operate on the principle of &quot;firstcome, first served&quot;, thus involving no national quotas, I see no alternative but to be frank about the Irish if the question is raised, taking our standupon the same considerations which led us in the context of nationalityto treat Irish citizens as if they were British subjects - a useful precedent in the present connection.    It would also be impracticable to have a comprehensive control of Commonwealth citizens entering this countryvia the Irish Republic.    Arrangements would be made for ad hoc controlwhere, for example, a large boatload of West Indians was expected bythis route:   for the rest we would hope to obtain - as we do over aliens -the co-operation of the immigration authorities of the Irish Republic in operating a control similar to ours.10.    Deportation.     The Commonwealth Migrants Committee considerprovision  or deportation desirable and overdue in its own rights, quite apart from the question of controlling Commonwealth immigration, and theBill includes provision for deportation essentially on the lines of thepolicy agreed when a draft Deportation Bill was considered in 1958-59.This provision enables the Courts to recommend the deportation of commonwealth citizens who have lived here for less than five years, donot belong to the United Kingdom by birth, descent or naturalisation andare convicted of any offence carrying liability to imprisonment.     The
Legislation. Committee suggested, however, that an immigrant should be liable to deportation even if he had lived here for more than five years,provided that this result could be achieved without an unfortunate discrimina-tion between citizens of dependent and independent Commonwealthterritories.    There is no provision for deportation except on therecommendation of a Court and the Home Secretary will have a discretionwhether or not to order deportation.11.     But under the British Nationality Act, 1948, as it now stands,citiaens of most other Commonwealth countries could escape liability todeportation after only twelve months&apos; residence in the United Kingdom byexercising the right given in Section 6(1) to register as citiaens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.    For citizens of most commonwealth countries such registration entails loss of their former citizenship, withthe result that a subsequent deportation order could not be made effective.The Commonwealth Migrants Committee consider that the british nationality Act, 1948, should be amended by increasing the period prescribed in Section 6(1) from twelve months to five years, thus bringing it fully into line with the proposed period during which Commonwealth citizenswould be liable to deportation.     It is proposed that there should be a periodof six months during which persons may exercise an existing right to registration which would otherwise be removed by the Bill.12,     The form of the Bill.    In view of the importance and politicalsensitivity of the course which it is now proposed to take, both theCommonwealth Migrants Committee and the Legislation Committee are agreed that it would be advisable to include in the Bill itself rather thanin any subordinate legislation all those provisions which we do not expect to require variation from time to time.13.    Miscellanoous.   In accordance with the wishes of the legislation committee I am arranging for further consideration to be given to thefollowing points:-(a)Short title.    It may be plssible to reflect in the title the importance of the deportation provisions andto reduce the emphasis on &quot;Commonwealth&quot;.&quot;Immigration and Deportation (commonwealth citizens) Bill&quot; is a possibility.(b)The position of West Indian recruits to the british army who exercise while in this country the right topurchase    their discharge within three months ofenlistment.(c)The application of the Bill to Scotland, NorthernIreland and the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan.(d)The five year limit for deportation (see paragraph 10above).
Cost14. As far as it is possible to judge at this stage, the administrativecost of the scheme would be somewhere in the region of  500, 000 a yearRe commendations15.    I ask my colleagues -(a)    To approve the draft Bill subject to further revisionas may be necessary.(b)    To agree that it should be mentioned in The Queen&apos;sSpeech and published early in November.R.
