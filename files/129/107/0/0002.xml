(61) 1526th October, 1961CABINETSYRIA AND KUWAITNote by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs am circulating for the information of my colleagues theattached memorandum about the situation in the Middle East andKuwait following the recent coup in Syria.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I.6th October, 1961.SYRIA AND KUWAITIs it thought that Iraq will now attack Kuwait to exploit theconfusion caused by the Egypt-Syria situation?H. M. Ambassador at Baghdad does not think thatGeneral qassim&apos;s is likely to move against Kuwait at present.    Iraqiforces are committed in Kurdistan and General qassim&apos;s will keep a force ready against developments in Syria as well as forces in baghdad for internal security.    If the Arab Beague force in Kuwaitwere to disintegrate, General qassim&apos;s&apos;s temptation to intervene in kuwait would be increased.    He could mount an attack by a brigade group with armour within three days of the order being given, andwe cannot be certain of having warning of this.2.        So far there is no indication of any lack of co-operationbetween the contingents of the Arab Beague   force and no sign that any government wishes to withdraw.     The most serious development,and a likely one if there were a counter coup in Syria, would be thewithdrawal of the Jordanian contingent which makes up nearly halfthe force.-1-
What news or views on all this are coming from the Ruler of Kuwait ?3. The Supreme Council of Kuwait were deeply divided, for reasons not connected with Syria, on the question of whether our with-drawal should be accelerated or not, but the view that it should notseems to have prevailed.     The Amir is alive to the dangers for Kuwaitimplicit in the Syrian revolution, but he has not asked us to delay the departure of our forces.What is our actual military position in relation to Kuwait and what is our power to return if called on? What do we do if General Qassimmoves ?4, There are now no infantry left and insufficient british forces remain in Kuwait to hold the airfield.    If the Iraqis attackbefore lOth-llth October, when our withdrawal is to be completed,the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has discretion to re-introducetroops at the formal request of the Amir and with the concurrence ofthe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.    Some troops, and oneclay fighter-ground attack squadron, could return to Kuwait withinfifteen hours of the order to move;  within thirty-six hours more could arrive from Aden.    But the security of points o  entry for Britishtroops now depends on the Arab League force.    The Kuwaiti forcesalone could not be relied on to defend these points for thirty-six hours.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, suggested that if there were a risk of the Arab League force becoming ineffective the following measures should be taken:-(a) If the risk were immediate he should be given authority before 5th October to put one infantry battalion and some tank crews back into Kuwait.Alternatively, before 5th Octoberwe couldlimit ourselves to suspending the withdrawalof British troops.(b) If the risk materialised after British forces had left, additional transport aircraft should represent-positioned, so that he could deploy threeinfantry battalions with supporting arms withinthirty-six hours.5. It would be desirable militarily to take the precautionssuggested by the Commander-in-Chief, but politically it would be verydifficult to slow down or reverse the movement of British troops,unless we could show good reason for it.     In fact there is no evidence that General qassim&apos;s plans an immediate attack or that theArab League force will disintegrate.    The Political Resident hasbeen instructed to have the facts put before the Amir, withoutimplying that we shall have any change in the present withdrawalplan, and the Acting Consul-General will do this on 7th October.The object of the interview is to ensure that the Amir is aware of the risks which we see in the situation and to point out the need for keeping in close touch, since a dangerous situation might develop-2-
45at great speed.    The possibility of temporarily stationing more transport aircraft in the area in order to enable the Commander-in-Chief toreact rapidly will also have to be considered.    The Cabinet havealready agreed that the Commander-in-Chief shall receive delegatedauthority to react to an Iraqi attack after our withdrawal is complete.(C.C.(6l) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 5).6. In short, although there is no immediate danger to Kuwait,the potential risk is greater than it was before the Syrian revolution,and we must watch closely for any indication of disintegration of theArab -League force or of aggressive intentions on General qassim&apos;s&apos;part.The Situation in Syria7. There does not seem to be much hope of stability in thelong run.    Syria has always been deeply divided, and in its thirteenyears of independent existence there have been numerous militarycoirr^s.    Although in 1958 the country as a whole favoured union with egypt, there has been much discontent recently as a result of thedisplacement of Syrians by Egyptians and of President Nasser&apos;s measuresof nationalisation and centralisation.     The revolution seems to havebeen carried out by a small number of officers whose political views are unknown.    It is not clear how much support they and the right-wingcivilian Government enjoy in the country at largej  no doubtPresident Nasser still has supporters in Syria and will find scope forsubversion.8. If fighting began in Syria the consequences could be dangerous.     The Jordanians might intervene in support of the new regime and General qassim&apos;s might do the same.     The Israelis might cause trouble on their border with Egypt in order to damagePresident Nasser and this might stir up an Arab-Israel crisis.9. Even if President Nasser does not rally support in Syria,the outlook is not promising since we may see a reversion to theprevious pattern of fierce internal Syrian political struggles andcovert intervention in Syria by the Iraqis, Jordanians and Saudis aswell as by the Egyptians.    Syria is perhaps the country in the areamost subject to penetration by the Communists.10. Outside Syria, President Nasser may be tempted toretrieve his prestige by subversion in Jordan or Libya, or Saudi Arabia.The opposition to General Qassirn in Iraq may be tempted to follow the syrian example and increase their plots.     The only immediatecompensation is that General qassim&apos;s&apos;s pre-occupation with Syria maymake him defer his struggle with the Iraq Petroleum Company anddeflect his attention from Kuwait.    We may be in for a new periodof unrest in the Middle East after some three years of relative calm.11. It would be helpful politically if our recognition could be delayed until a number of Arab countries had decided their attitude, inorder not to antagonise President Nasser more than necessary.    Hisbroadcast on 5th October makes our problem of when to recognisemuch easier.October,, 1261 *
