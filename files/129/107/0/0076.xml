(61) 19528th November, 1961CABINETBERLIN: MILITARY PLANNINGMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceAt the meeting on 2nd November, I was invited to consider, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, whether any adjustments should be proposed in thesize and composition of the force intended for the probe along the autobahn ifroad access to Berlin were blocked (C.C. (61) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2). TheForeign Secretary agrees with the substance and recommendations of thismemorandum.Berlin Contingency Planning2. A planning group known as LIVE OAK composed of militaryrepresentatives of the United States, France and the United Kingdom under thecontrol of the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), General Norstad,has for a considerable time been planning various tripartite military operationswhich might be undertaken if the Soviet bloc should deny the Allies land or airaccess to Berlin. Since August this year a German liaison officer has beenassociated with the work of the group and has had access to all its papers.3. The LIVE OAK plans comprise:(a) A tripartite probe-FREE STYLE-which is designed to test Sovietintentions to use force to deny Allied ground access to Berlin;(b) Limited tripartite ground operations along the autobahn-TRADEWIND with a battalion group and JUNE BALL with a division sizeforce-to provide a rising scale of military operations to demonstrateAllied determination to re-open ground access to Berlin;(c) Air operations-JACK PINE-to maintain Allied air access to Berlin fora civil and garrison airlift, including fighter escort.4. This planning has been without commitment by Governments. ButGeneral Norstad has been given certain authority to introduce at his discretioncertain of the non-warlike measures planned for operations in the air corridors.5. President Kennedy&apos;s Administration have accepted a concept of Berlinoperations far closer than their predecessors&apos; to our own. We are now agreed thatin the event of Allied access along the autobahn being denied a small tripartiteforce (FREE STYLE) should be despatched along the autobahn in the first place,and that it would be preferable to resort to the air operations planned under JACKPINE before extended ground operations (TRADE WIND or JUNE BALL) wereundertaken.TOP SECRET60034
2TOP SECRETFREE STYLE6. The purpose of the FREE STYLE operation is simply to establish beyondany doubt the determination of the Soviet or East German Governments to useforce to block our ground access to Berlin. For this purpose, there are threedifferent scales and levels on which the operation might have to be carried out:(a) To establish the fact of physical obstruction, a small force of 56 men and15 vehicles would be sufficient;(b) To show that the Soviet or East German authorities were prepared tosupport their action by force, 77 men, 18 vehicles, and 2 armouredpersonnel carriers and 2 armoured cars would be required;(c) To take positive action to remove any obstruction but without resortingto force except in self-defence, 120 men, 22 vehicles, a bulldozer.2 armoured personnel carriers, and 2 armoured cars would be required.7. It would have to be decided at the time whether a FREE STYLE operation,and if so which one, should be mounted. For example, if the Russians or EastGermans had already demonstrated their determination to use force to deny theAllies access to Berlin, there might be no need to probe their intentions on theground. Another consideration is that a FREE STYLE operation might bewilfully misinterpreted by the Soviet Government as an unsuccessful aggressionagainst East Germany which justified them in using force to prevent subsequent&quot; intrusion &quot; into East German air space during JACK PINE operations. Muchwould also depend on the assessment at the time of the type of obstructions thatwere likely to be encountered on the autobahn. Thus, the mounting of a FREESTYLE operation of any kind is a matter which must remain subject toGovernmental decisions at the time.General Norstads Proposals on FREE STYLE8. General Norstad has asked the Ambassadorial Group to authorise himto assemble the FREE STYLE force now and to hold it indefinitely at six hours&apos;notice. This decision could hardly be kept secret. There seems no justificationfor this action at a time when the Russians are showing patience over the Berlinproblem. In any case, before a FREE STYLE operation is launched, we andthe Americans, at least, envisage warning the Soviet Government of our intentionso that the limited nature of the operation may be clear to them and they shouldhave the opportunity to withdraw. We also have in mind a public announcementin advance of the operation so that public opinion also may be aware of thelimited nature of the operation. It is also envisaged that the forces of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) would have to be alerted before such anoperation were put in hand. These preliminary steps, quite apart from the finaldecision by Governments to carry out a FREE STYLE operation, will certainlytake longer than the six hours envisaged by General Norstad. It would be difficultin any case to hold the FREE STYLE force at six hours&apos; readiness indefinitely.On the other hand, it would be reasonable to give General Norstad discretionto assemble the FREE STYLE force, but not to launch it, if the situation wereclearly and unmistakably evolving in such a way as to suggest that our groundaccess to Berlin might be interrupted by the Russians or East Germans. However,in these circumstances, there would probably be time for tripartite consultationand agreement to the assembly of the force.NATO Alert Measures9. NATO have asked General Norstad to consider urgently the appropriatealert measures which NATO forces should adopt before the start of any tripartitemilitary action to maintain access to Berlin. We shall need to look at this questionagain when we know his views.Command in Berlin10. The tripartite Powers have agreed that in emergency General Norstadmay appoint the American Commandant as the single Allied Commander in Berlinon the joint recommendation of the British, French and American Commandantsthat such a course was necessary in order to meet grave civil disturbance or overtarmed attack. The British Commandant has been instructed to consult HerMajesty&apos;s Government if time permits before joining in such a recommendation.TOP SECRET
TOP SECRET311. At present the British Commandant in Berlin is responsible to HerMajesty&apos;s Government through two channels. On political matters he is responsiblethrough H.M. Ambassador in Bonn to the Foreign Office; on military matters he isresponsible through the Commander-in-Chief, British Army of the Rhine, and theWar Office to the Minister of Defence. In the event of the single Allied Command^ being set up in Berlin the military chain of command has never been clearly^ defined. It has been assumed, however, that the single Allied Commander wouldbe responsible to General Norstad; as the Commander-in-Chief, Europe(CINCEUR), so long as only the tripartite Powers were involved, and as SACEURonce control of operations had passed to NATO. In the first case political controlwould be exercised over General Norstad as CINCEUR through the AmbassadorialGroup in Washington, and in the second case it would be exercised over him asSACEUR through the North Atlantic Council. However, the situation is notabsolutely clear, and uncertainty about the chain of command needs to be clearedup with our Allies.12. The American Commandant in Berlin has suggested to his colleaguesthat he should seek General Norstad&apos;s authority for a change in the existingarrangements for Command in Berlin. The essence of his proposal is that in theevent of emergency, or at the request of any commandant, the ChairmanCommandant should be able to take necessary preliminary measures to includedeploying or committing all or part of the Allied garrison in advance of theestablishment of the single command, so there should be no delay when it is set up.The implication that the Chairman Commandant might commit forces without theunanimous agreement of his colleagues is unacceptable. The British Commandanthas recommended that his American colleague&apos;s proposal should be amended toallow the Chairman Commandant merely to alert and deploy the Allied garrison.There is already provision for this in the case of a threat of grave civil disturbance,and it seems reasonable to extend the provision to the case of a threat of armedattack.13. The American Commandant has also proposed that each commandantshould be authorised by his respective Government and at his discretion to permitany of his forces to be commanded by the Chairman Commandant in emergencysituations prior to designation of the single commander. If the transfer of commandimplies authority to commit forces, this is a dangerous proposal, since it couldlead to the commitment of forces without the unanimous agreement of the threecommandants. It is also an unnecessary proposal, since if a commandant werewilling to transfer his command to the Chairman Commandant, he would equallybe ready to agree to the establishment of the single command, which he is alreadyauthorised to do if time does not allow further authority to be sought. Thisproposal also should therefore be removed from the American Commandant&apos;srecommendations to General Norstad.Conclusions14. In my view the size and composition of the forces envisaged for the FREESTYLE operations are about right and the concept of the operations is sound. I donot consider that we should agree to General Norstad&apos;s proposal to assemble theFREE STYLE force now, but it would be reasonable to allow him discretion to dothis if the situation were to evolve in such a way as to suggest clearly andunmistakably that the Russians or East Germans might deny us ground access toBerlin. He could be told this. We should clearly define with our Allies the chainof command between General Norstad and the single Allied commander in Berlin.We should also settle outstanding problems relating to the establishment of thesingle command in Berlin, subject to the essential principles that there should beno authority to commit forces (which is implied by the single command), without theunanimous agreement of the three commandants.  Recommendations15. I ask my colleagues to agree:(a) No adjustment of the existing FREE STYLE plans is necessary.(b) We should not agree to General Norstad&apos;s proposal that the FREE STYLEforce should be assembled now and kept indefinitely at six hours&apos; notice,but we should agree to delegate authority to him to assemble a forceTOP SECRET
TOP SECRETas a precautionary measure if the situation were clearly developing insuch a way as to suggest that blockage of our ground access to Berlinmight be imminent.(c) The Ambassadorial Group in Washington should be asked to makerecommendations on the chain of command between General Norstadand the single Allied Commander in Berlin.(d) We should agree to a recommendation from the American Commandantin Berlin to General Norstad that the Chairman Commandant shouldhave authority to alert and deploy (but not commit) Allied forces inthe event of a direct military threat or actual attack, before theestablishment of the single command.H.
