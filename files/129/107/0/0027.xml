Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1961C. (61) 177 Copy  No.3rd November, 1961CABINETTHE NUBIAN MONUMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of education in April 1959 the United Arab Republic appealed to the United nations educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for internationalassistance to save the monuments of Nubia which will be submerged by 1964 as aresult of construction on the High Dam. The Sudan made a similar appeal inOctober 1959 since the flooding will extend well beyond the frontier. on 8th March, 1960, UNESCO launched an international appeal for funds forthree objects:(a) the rapid investigation of unexplored archeological sites in Nubia;(b) the transfer of temples to safe sites;(c) the preservation of monuments in situ (the most important being Philaeand Abu Simbel).The response to (a) has been good. It seems likely that all sites will have been investigated before the waters rise. The United Kingdom contribution consisted of a special Treasury grant of  20,000 to the Egypt Exploration Society which hasbeen divided between work in Egypt and the Sudan.2. Large sums of money will be needed for ib) and (c). On 4th August,UNESCO informed member States that the sum needed for (b) and (c) in bothEgyptian and Sudanese Nubia would amount to $87 millions, of which $20 millionswill be found by Egypt. UNESCO must be expecting to raise this sum by newcontributions since the Trust Fund for voluntary contributions is showing a lossbecause of appeal expenses. By far the largest item is to raise Abu Simbel abovethe danger line. The estimated cost of this is $70 millions which will need to befound by March 1962. UNESCO suggested that the Governments might contributeaccording to the percentages of their contributions to the budget of UNESCO.This would mean a contribution by the United Kingdom of just over $5 millions.3.   So far the following contributions have been promised:United States $2-5 millions   ...      ($4 millions in all $2-5 millions for removing lesser temples, $1-5 millions for archeological work. Considerationof $6 millions for Philae postponed.The vote of a further sum specificallyfor the Abu Simbel project is expected in 1962.)Italy $3 millions        ....     ...      (Double the percentage contribution.)Netherlands $550,000 (over ten      (Almost exactly the percentage contribu-years) tion.)Germany DM.3,200,000       ...      (For moving a specified temple.)France $200,000 ......      (Token figure.)It is reported that Argentina, Belgium, Cambodia, Indonesia, Luxembourg and pakistan will contribute small sums. Tunisia has made a substantial offer in kind.Brazil, Monaco, the Scandinavian countries together, and Spain are reported tobe taking some action.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT59926
4. Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Chairman of the United Kingdom national committee on Nubia, is of the opinion that an appeal for funds limited to industry,which he thinks might be useful, would only give results if the Government gave a lead.5. The arguments against a contribution by Her Majesty&apos;s Government reston ,the resentment of several thousand British subjects, whose assets are blockedbrittle Egyptian Government, at being unable to recover their property, reinforced by our policy to reduce Government expenditure, particularly across the exchanges.In addition there is obvious value to the Soviets in the propaganda point thatthey are constructing the High Dam to help the living while the West are concentrated with saving monuments from the past.I told the House of Commons as recently as 13th July that the Government&quot; are not contemplating any contribution from public funds for this purpose &quot;and that &quot; if sums of money of this size were available, it should be rememberedthat there are so many children out of school in Africa that it would be betterspent on them &quot;.6. The Foreign Secretary wishes to recommend a United kingdom contribution of  50,000 on the following grounds:(a) the money would go, at least in the first place, not to the Governmentof the United Arab Republic but to UNESCO; and it would be spenton preserving an object of the greatest historical and cultural interest,not for the United Arab Republic but for the world at large. this argument could be used to counter objections from the disappointedBritish claimants;(b) it would look odd if the United Kingdom, with its outstanding reputationin the field of Egyptology, should fail to contribute, when the FrenchGovernment, whose relations with the United Arab Republic areworse than ours, and who have the same problem of Suez claimants,are expected to make a contribution;(c) President Nasser, in a recent letter to President Kennedy, referred to thelatter proposal that the United States should contribute $6 millions to save the temple at Philae as a bright moment in United States-united arab Republic relations. It is pretty certain that the Government ofthe United Arab Republic would be quite inordinately antipathetic toany refusal on our part to contribute; and that by contributing weshould gain credit with them quite beyond the size of our contribution.7. We should consider too whether in view of our relations with the Sudanwe should earmark some part of any United Kingdom contribution to UNESCCsappeal for work in the Sudan.8. This is a political decision. The money could be better spent in many other directions, e.g., education in Africa. We should consider too whether 50,000 would be sufficient to secure some goodwill and to stimulate privatecontributions. If we do wish to mitigate the damage done to ancient monumentsas a result of the Russian contract, I would prefer to help digging and conservationon the Sudan side of the border where there has been much less exploration.I realise that if the Cabinet rejects the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal PresidentNasser and the Egyptologists would react against us.9.   We need to decide:(a) whether to subscribe  50,000;(b) whether to divide it into  40,000 for Egyptian and  10,000 for SudaneseNubia;(c) whether we should make it a condition that our contribution should be devoted only to projects which can be successfully completed.D.E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,2nd November, 1961.
