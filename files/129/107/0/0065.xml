Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1961C. (61) 215 Copy No.    5 814th December, 1961CABINETIMMUNITIES   AND   PRIVILEGES   FOR   commonwealth organisaitons IN  BRITAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the committee of officials set up to examine this matter in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 7th March (C.C. (61) 11th Conclusions, Minute 8) have now reported.   The report has been circulated under cover of C. (61) 216.2. I do not find convincing the distinction they draw between international and Commonwealth organisations. I think it is wrong in principle that commonwealth organisations set up in this country should receive treatment inrespect of immunities and privileges inferior to that accorded to international organisations and I believe Parliament would readily accept this.3. Since I last brought this matter to the attention of the Cabinet (C. (61) 27)there has been steady and increasing pressure from one of the commonwealth organisaitons concerned the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee andthe question is almost certain to be raised at the Commonwealth EducationConference in Delhi next January where the Minister of Education will be leadingthe British delegation. Moreover, I have learned that the Chairman of theCommonwealth Economic Committee intends to raise the matter with me whenhe is here later this month.4. I think it most important that we should be in a position to say in reply that we are favourably disposed in principle and that we shall be in touch withother Commonwealth Governments about the legislation that will be necessary.5. If we are to have any chance of building up worthwhile machinery for commonwealth co-operation we must not act in such a way as to suggest that we attach little importance to the Commonwealth organisations which at present form part of that machinery. I hope therefore my colleagues will agree in principlethat Commonwealth organisations should be put on an equal footing, so far asimmunities and privileges are concerned, with international organisations, and thatdetails should be discussed with the other Commonwealth Governments.D. S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,13th December, 1961.60125
