SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(61) 1838th November, 1961CCPY NO.22CABINETBERLIN:  ECONOMIC COUNTER-MEASURESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsI should like my colleagues to consider the draft decision whichthe Americans have proposed that we should support in the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation (N. A. T. O. ).   The text is annexed.2. Discussion   of this question with the Americans has alreadycaused considerable difficulties.   They had hoped to get N. A. T.O. totake a decision now that would in effect make the imposition of a totalembargo virtually automatic at the moment when the contingency in whichit was considered appropriate was shown to have occurred.   They alsotended to define the contingency itself rather more flexibly than we did.3. The attached text represents a considerable move on theirpart towards our point of view.   The actual wording, which is mainlytheirs, certainly leaves much to be desired.   But some of it is liftedfrom the Paris Agreed Minute, which we cannot go back on, and inpractice the third sentence of the draft gives us the safeguard that werequire.   It ensures that when the time comes, all the Governmentswill be able to determine whether or not the moment has come to impose atotal embargo.   Meanwhile there is nothing more than a moral obligationto consider its imposition positively when the moment is agreed to havearrived.   The last sentence of the draft makes it clear that the momentenvisaged is that of last resort and that the measures would then bedesigned as an effort to avoid the necessity for undertaking combatantoperations.   This is the concept for which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave been striving ever since, the Paris meeting of August, 1961,and our discussions with the Americans about the draft text have shownthat they are now very close to sharing our view   of it.      Indeed theymust realise that this is the most that they can expect tc get out ofN. A. T. O.4.        It can be argued that if the issue were under debate in theUnited Nations at the time when access to Berlin was totally blocked, wemight not wish to impose an economic embargo.   But the fact is that theissue will be taken to the United Nations as soon as there is any interferezicwith our access.   In practice this is likely to be some time before weare under any obligation to impose an embargo.   The counter measures*? 1SECRET
SECRETamounting to a total embargo come into question only when the situationhas deteriorated on the access routes to the point of complete blockageof access and there would be no difficulty in showing up Sovietresponsibility for this in the United Nations.    The fact that the UnitedNations had been siezed of the matter beforehand would enable us toargue that the Soviets were determined to flout the wishes of theorganisation.    The state of the affair in the United Nations would beone of the &quot;circumstances of the moment&quot; in the light of which, underthis formula, the Governments would take the final decision.    I do notthink therefore that we could be accused by the Americans of bad faithif, after having agreed to the attached formula, we were to argue in theevent that the state of play in the United Nations or other circumstancesat the time, rendered the action inopportune, assuming of course thatthey were good arguments.5. I hope that my colleagues will therefore agree to the appendedtext.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I.8th November, 1961.&quot;The  Council have decided that in the event that military andcivilian access, air or ground, to West Berlin is blocked, the immediateimposition of significant counter measures amounting to a total embargoagainst the Soviet bloc would be an appropriate response.    The N.A. Te O.countries are planning their concerted participation in such an effort.In the event that blockage appears to be substantially complete, theCouncil will meet and as appropriate, acting under guidance ofGovernments, will consider whether in fact such blockage has takenplace and what the timing of the total embargo should be, in the lightof all the circumstances of the moment.    However, if in fact suchblockage of access to West Berlin has occurred, there can be no roomfor doubt but that a total embargo will be enforced as a measure of lastresort in an effort to avoid the necessity for undertaking combatantoperations. &quot;November T 1961-2~SECRET
