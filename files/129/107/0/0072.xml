SECRETlias DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1961      ;       .C. (61) 222 Copy No. 6 429th December, 1961.CABINETASSISTANCE TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENTOF AN INDONESIAN ATTACK ON WEST NEW GUINEAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 19th December President Sukarno of Indonesia made a speech to the nationin which he announced that he had ordered &quot; the armed forces of Indonesia to fulfilat any time fixed by us (President Sukarno) their responsibility for liberating WestIrian (Netherlands New Guinea) from the fetters of Dutch colonialism &quot;i He alsoinstructed the people to be ready for a general mobilisation. Her Majesty&apos;ambassador considers that the Indonesians will almost certainly launch an attackif the Dutch do not concede New Guinea as a result of negotiation, but that an invasion is unlikely for some while yet.2. In the event of an attack we are obliged to assist the Dutch in accordancewith an assurance given by Mr. Profumo (then Minister of State for Foreign Affairs)on 27th February, 1959, as amended by a subsequent exchange of letters, in thefollowing terms:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot enter into a commitment to providemilitary support, but they would do everything within their power to assistthe Netherlands Government in appropriate ways.&quot;The exchange of letters added &quot; It is not likely that we should give such (military)support. On the other hand, the possibility is not excluded &quot;. The United StatesGovernment have given no such undertaking.3. The Netherlands Ambassador called on the Lord Privy Seal on21st December and put the following three points on the instructions of hisGovernment:(a) Would Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree to deliver no further arms to indonesia in view of President Sukarno&apos;s threat?We have entered into a number of contracts to sell arms to the indonesians (see Annex A) and are negotiating other deliveries (see annex B). We have obtained undertakings from the Indonesian government that they will not use the weapons for any purposes other than the defence of their present territory. We can have littlereliance on such promises, however, and know that the Indonesianshave already broken them in respect of American equipment whichwas used to land saboteurs in Dutch West New Guinea. It istherefore undesirable that we should deliver any further weaponsuntil we can see how the situation develops.(b) In the event of an attack on West New Guinea the netherlands government would expect Her Majesty&apos;s Government to fulfil theundertaking given in 1959.We have interpreted our undertaking to mean that we would give&quot; logistic &quot; support to the Dutch but not military support. discussions were held between the Royal Navy and the Royal Netherlands navy in 1960 without reaching any definite conclusions. The Dutch askedfor facilities to repair their ships at Hong Kong and Singapore.  They60176
the/were informed that, while we did not exclude this, it might well be tnative labour would refuse to work on any Dutch vessels, so that facilities would prove valueless. The Dutch also asked whether theirfuel requirements could be met and whether a fleet auxiliary tanker:&apos; could be made1 available to refuel Dutch ships at sea. Again they were told that, although we could agree to this in principle and could providefuel in Singapore, it might be very difficult for the Navy to find a tankerat the time. As nearly a year has elapsed since the last of these discussions, there might be advantage in finding out what the Dutchnow have in mind by resuming talks through service channels.(c) Should the Netherlands Government decide to take this dispute to theSecurity Council, could they count on Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfssupport?u, The Netherlands delegation raised the problem of New Guineaat the recent Assembly of the United Nations. A resolutionembodying most of their requirements obtained 53 votes but not thenecessary two-thirds majority. They could not expect to do betterthan this in the Assembly on a second round. In the Security Councilthey would certainly run into a Soviet veto. Nevertheless they willappeal to the Security Council if there is an attack and may well raisethe matter before then as a preventive measure. In that case, weshould certainly give our support for any reasonable proposals and&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; for any resolution aimed to prevent the use of force by Indonesia.4.   I recommend:(i) That we should delay all further deliveries of arms to Indonesia untileither a negotiated settlement is reached or it is clear that the indonesians have abandoned aggressive intentions. We should soinform the Dutch.(ii) That we should inform the Netherlands Government that we have no specific plans for logistic support but that if they wish to re-establishcontact through service channels, we would be prepared to consider&apos;, their requirements.(iii) That in the event of an appeal by them to the United Nations we should support any reasonable proposals or any resolution designed to preventthe use of force.H.: Foreign Office, S.W.1,28th December, 1961.
