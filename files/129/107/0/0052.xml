(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it is now becoming urgent to decide on our long-term policy on wages and ssalaries.     There has been widespread disquiet in thecountry at the results of continuing inflation and there is a mountingfeeling among our own supporters that the Government must takedecisive steps to limit the rise in wage costs.    I introduced the wage&quot;pause&quot; as a temporary measure to let productivity catch up withwages and to give us a breathing space during which we might evolvea long-term policy.    It is clear that the &quot;pause&quot; cannot at best lastvery long into next year:  wage settlements in various parts of the economy outside our control may bit by bit undermine it.    We must therefore be ready very soon to decide what is the longer term policy that should replace it.2.      The Economic Policy Committee have had two discussions on a longer-term incomes policy.    These discussions have been basedmainly on the draft statement (Annex A of C. (61) 205) which has beenprepared by an inter-departmental group of officials under sir Frank Lee&apos;s chairmanship.     The main element of the proposed policy is the issue of a &quot;guiding light&quot; representing the governments view of the average rate of increase of total money incomes per headwhich is consistent with a healthy and competitive economy.    It issuggested that over the next two or three years this increase might beput forward as 2.\ per cent.    As a counterpart to the restraint whichthe statement urges should be accepted by wages and salary earners,it is proposed that the Government should accept a commitment tokeep aggregate profits from increasing disproportionately as comparedwith aggregate pay over a period of years.    This obligation would imply taking corrective action in fiscal or other fields if theseconditions were found to obtain.3.      There are three main lines of policy which we might conceivably follow:-(i) A policy of full control over wages, profits, prices and the like with a system of thorough-going legalsanctions and controls (Annex C of C.(6l) 205).(ii)  No wages policy in the ordinary sense of that term,i. e. , reversion to the system which operatedprior to the pause.CJ 1)J202COPY NO.5th December, 1961CABINETINCOMES POLICY-1-
(iii)  A middle course of the kind put forward in the reportby officials.4.      The first course mentioned in paragraph 3 is in my view clearlyout of the question.    It is far removed from the system which has longoperated in this country and it is a doctrine that would mean moving,as the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons on 21st November,&quot;a long way from a free society which it is our purpose to preserve&quot;.5.      The reversion to the arrangements which existed before thepause would be a confession of failure and would, I think, result in theloss of any ground we may have gained from the wages pause.    It hasbeen suggested that this policy might nonetheless work if industry wereexposed to greater competition, unemployment were allowed to riseslowly and wages and prices were then left to be settled by economicforces unhindered by the Government.    Such a policy however wouldrequire a much higher level of unemployment and probably of taxationthan is likely to be politically acceptable:  and it would be economicallydamaging in as much as it would involve severe restrictions oneconomic growth. 16.      The Economic Policy Committee have expressed a number of views on a middle course on the lines of the &quot;guiding light&quot; policyput forward by officials.    The views of the Minister without Portfolioare set out in Annex E of C. (61) 205.     The views expressed in discussions of the Economic Policy Committee are summarised in the following paragraphs.Main objections to an incomes policy based on a &quot;guiding light&apos;&apos;7.      Serious doubts were expressed whether such a policy could be successful.    In the conditions of free collective bargaining in thiscountry the policy would be no more than an appeal to workers and employers, and such exhortation has not been fruitful in the past.Owing to the pressures which trade unions can exert there would be many wage settlements in excess of the &quot; guiding light&quot;.     Each wouldbe heralded as a further defeat for the Government.8.      Even if it were possible to keep increases in basic wage ratesnear the &quot;guiding light&quot;, employers in many individual firms would find ways (as they do now) of increasing the pay of their workers inorder to keep or expand their labour forces.    As a result, earnings would increase much faster than basic rates, and it is unrealistic to suppose that they could be contained within an increase of, say,2j per cent a year.     The Zj per cent would tend to become a built-inminimum.9.      The Trades Union Congress have no power to commit theirmember Unions to a wages policy and it is extremely doubtful whethereven if the Congress did acquiesce in such a policy individual tradeunions would co-operate in a course which seemed contrary to theirown interests.-2-S EC RET
10.     Too restrictive a curb on aggregate profits might limit thegrowth of the more efficient and enterprising firms.Arguments in favour of a &quot;guiding light&quot; policy11.     The Government are firmly committed to announcing a longer-term policy to replace the &quot;pause&quot;.    Having already declared that increases in incomes should foe contained within the growth of productivity, the next step is to quantify the tolerable rate of increase.It is better to give a lead, even if the policy may result in apparentreverses for the Government, than to fail to give a lead at all.    Itwould be a new and important psychological element in the situation that the Government were for the first time publicly declaring therate of increase in incomes which the economy might be expected tobear without inflation:  and this of itself would increase pressuresand particularly the pressure of public opinion on both sides of industry to act with restraint.    The support of public opinion isan essential element in an effective wages policy.12.    A policy on the lines proposed by officials appears to be theonly way which holds out any prospect of obtaining the co-operation ofboth sides of industry in the long run.     The Economic PolicyCommittee thought that an attempt to back up a &quot;guiding light&quot; policy with sanctions would not only prevent acceptance of the policy but would lead towards a fully controlled economy.13,    Even if a &quot;guiding light&quot; of 2f per cent became a built-in minimum and in practice 4 per cent became the average this would, be better than our experience in recent years when the average increase has beenbetween 5 and 6 per cent.Next Steps14.    It will be necessary to consult both sides of industry before theissue of any statement about incomes policy.    In view of the timing(we must be ready to make a public statement early in the New Yearand indeed there may be a Parliamentary debate before Christmas)such consultation cannot wait for the setting up of the national economic Development Council.    We need to consider the basis and content of discussion with both sides of industry and also of a public statement.15.    There might be advantage in giving both sides of industry a written statement to serve either as a basis of discussion or as an aide-memoire:   the subject is too difficult and complicated for oralpresentation only.     They might be given a document on the linesof the officials&apos; draft - which could be adjusted here and there totake away the impression of a finished and formal document.    Itcould be put forward under the heading of &quot;A Possible Approach toan Incomes Policy&quot; and described as a draft by officials, producedas a basis for discussion and without any commitment on theGovernments part.     This would lessen embarrassment in eventof a leak.
16.      It is most unlikely that these discussions will have led to an agreed statement of policy by say, the end of January or earlyFebruary next year.    It will therefore become necessary for theGovernment to issue an interim statement.     This statement could take one or two forms, both of which would be represented as interimguidance issued by the Government pending further examination ofthese matters either in the National Economic Development council or otherwise.     The first would be that we would move from the pauseto a suggested permissible overall figure for the increase in wagesand salaries of 2jr per cent, with all the qualifications in the officials&apos;report.    The alternative would be that we would move from the pauseto a policy of restraint in incomes, the request for which would bebased on the best possible estimate we could give of the economicprospect over the following twelve months.     This might be said to mark no advance on our previous policies in the matter, and might appear a lame conclusion to so much thought and effort on our part.We would not, however, need to take a decision on this until we know the results of the discussions with industry mentioned in paragraphs 14and 15 above.17.     Whichever course we follow there will inevitably be manydifficult practical problems in the transition from the pause policy.For instance we shall have to ensure that arbitration in the CivilService is not allowed retrospectively to breach the pay pause bydating awards before the end of the pause.Conclusion18.    I shall be glad to have the views of my colleagues in theCabinet.    I would like to have agreement that discussions should be opened with both sides of industry on the lines indicated in paragraph 15,and advice as to their timing.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.5th December, 1961.
