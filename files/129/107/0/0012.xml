.SUMMARY,OF THE LORDJPjUVY..SEAL^SOPENING STATEMENT ON 10TH QCTOPER, 1961,TO MEMBER GOVERNMENTS OF THE. european economic COMMUNITYIntroduction - The United Kingdom application the success or failure of the negotiations about to open will determine the future shape of the Continent.    Our decision to apply under Article 237of the Rome Treaty was made after a searching debate in the UnitedKingdom about our relations with Europe.    It was a decision arrived at,not on any narrow or short-term grounds, but as a result of a thoroughassessment of the needs of our country, of Europe, and of the Free world as a whole.     We now desire to become full, whole-hearted and activemembers of the Eurojjean Community.    In reaching our decision we hadto v/eigh very carefully the effect on the Commonwealth of so importanta development in United Kingdom policy.    We believe that it is in theinterests of all of us that nothing should be done which would be likely to damage the essential interests of members of the Commonwealth.     Weare confident, however, that solutions can be found to Commonwealthproblems which are fully compatible with the substance and spirit of theTreaty of Rome.     The United Kingdom application to join the community is made in a positive spirit and I hope that my statement will amplydemonstrate our determination to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.The United Kingdom and the Treaty of Rome2.      We are ready to accept without qualification the objectives laiddown in Articles   2 and 3 of the Treaty of Rome, and to play a full partin the institutions of the Community.    So far as we can judge at this stagewe see no need for any amendments to the Articles of the Treaty exceptin so far as adaptations are plainly required following on the admissionof new members.    It should be possible to deal with our special problemsby means of protocols.     In addition to the three major problems - theCommonwealth, agriculture and the European Free Trade Association -there will be other subjects arising from various articles of the Treatywe should like to discuss.    How far decisions taken by the Communitysince entry into force of the Treaty can be applied to the United kingdom as they stand should be a matter for joint examination.     I have in mindsuch matters as social security, control of monopolies, establishmentquestions and exchange control, where current practice in the UnitedKingdom and in Community countries is different.The Common External Tariff3.      So far as the level of the Community&apos;s common external tariffis concerned, the United Kingdom sees no need to ask for an item byitem re-negotiation.    We are prepared to accept the structure of the-1-
present tariff of the Community as the basis of the tariff of the enlarged community, although some items will have to be singled out for special treatment.    If the common tariff is to be acceptable to third countriessome reduction will probably be necessary and this might be achieved by making a linear cut of the order of 20 per cent.    We are also ready, onentering the Community, to make in a single operation the same cuts in tariffs on trade between Member States as will have been made by existing members on that date:   and to move our most-favoured-nation tarifftowards the new common tariff by steps equivalent to those already takenby other members.European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom4.      As regards the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom,the United Kingdom Government will be willing to enter into negotiations at the appropriate time with a view to joining these two Communities when we join the European Economic Community.European Unity in other Fields5.     The United Kingdom has also followed with close interest theprogress towards greater unity in fields other than those covered by thethree Communities.     The Heads of State and of the Governments of the six made an important declaration on this matter at Bonn on 18th July.The United Kingdom Government share the aims and objectives of thosewho drew it up and, once we have joined the Community, will work withits members in a positive spirit to reinforce the unity already achieved.It will certainly not be our aim to slow down the pace of developmentof the Community.     I am convinced that we all share the same essential interests, and that the habit of working together, once formed, will mean, not a slowing down, but a continued advance and the developmentof closer unity.ThjS-TJjijytejd Kingdom&apos;s three major problems6.      I now turn to the three problems of Commonwealth trade, UnitedKingdom agriculture, and the European Free Trade Association for which wehave to seek solutions together.Commonwealth Problems7.      We believe that you share our view of the value of the Commonwealthnot only to the United Kingdom but also to yourselves and to the whole free world.    It is a great force in the world for the promotion of ideals and purposes which are widely shared in Europe.     I should be misleading youif I failed to say how deeply the British people feel about it.     Common-wealth trade is one of the strongest elements maintaining this Common-wealth association.     The economies of most Commonwealth countries have been built up on the basis of supplying the British market, whichhas traditionally imported their produce duty-free and often onpreferential terms.     We could not join the European Economic community in its present form under conditions in which this trade connection v/ascut with grave loss or even ruin for some of them.-2-
8.     The problem of Commonwealth trade is analagous with the problems which faced you when you signed the Treaty in respect of count ries with whom you had special relationships.     These problems were dealt within such a way that in no case was a tariff imposed on imports from thesecountries where one had not been in force before.    Some countries, e.g. ,Morocco and Tunisia, preserved existing rights of entry to the marketof the country with whom they were associated.    Others became formally&quot;Associated Overseas Territories&quot; and gained a preferential position inthe Common Market as a whole.    Although Commonwealth trade is more extensive in range and .scale, the differences should not be exaggerated.On the assumption that there is general recognition  of the need to devisesatisfactory arrangements to protect vital interests of commonwealth countries it may be useful to suggest how the problem might be split up into its different components and how each of them might be treated.9.     As regards the less developed members of the commonwealth and the dependent territories, it seems to us that they should have theopportunity if they so wish to enter into Association with the community on the same terms as those which will in future be available to thepresent Associated Overseas Countries and Territories.     Tut some commonwealth countries may feel that some other arrangements mightsuit them better.     In any case Association of that kind may not bepossible for them all.    One way of dealing with the problems of those whoare not so associated would be to arrange for them to have maintainedunimpaired their rights of access to the United Kingdom market.    Anothermethod of proceeding would be on a commodity-by-commodity basis.It may be helpful to say something now about the main groups of commodities.10.    For tropical products we see two alternative lines of approach.The first, which would be appropriate when not only equality of opportunitybut also some measure of protection is essential, would be to grantfree entry into the United Kingdom market alone for the commonwealth country or territory which is not associated, and then to fix the common tariff of the enlarged Community at a level which would safeguard theinterests both of that country and of the countries and territoriesassociated with the Community.     The second line of approach would beto fix a aero, or a very low, level for the common tariff.11.     Raw materials should not in general give rise to difficulties as the common tariff on most of them is zero.     There are, however, afew on which it is substantial.    Five of them - aluminium, wood pulp,newsprint, lead and zinc - are of great importance to certain Common-wealth countries:   on these five we should wish to seek a zero tariff.12.    As regards manufactures, present conditions of entry into theUnited Kingdom have assisted industrial development throughout theCommonwealth.    The exporting industries concerned will be seriously affected if they have to face reverse preferences in favour of european countries.    Nevertheless we recognise that indefinite and unlimitedcontinuation of free entry over the whole of this field may not beregarded as compatible with the development of the Common Market.We are willing to discuss how to reconcile these two conflicting-3 -
considerations. The problem arises in a special form for manufacturesfrom low-cost countries. It would not be in the general interest that theUnited Kingdom should erect fresh barriers to cut back such trade.Temperate Foodstuffs13.    Temperate foodstuffs are a major concern for the Commonwealth,and particularly for Australia, New Zealand and Canada.     The problem is to reconcile Britain&apos;s obligations to the Commonwealth with thecommon agricultural policy as it evolves.    We would urge you to agreethat full regard should be paid to the interests of the Commonwealthproducers concerned and that they should be given in the future theopportunity of outlets for their produce comparable to those they nowenjoy.     There is a wide range of possible arrangements to this end,which include continued free entry;  duty-free, levy-free or preferentialquotas;  market sharing agreements;  and long-term contracts.United Kin;;dom Aj^ri^ultur e14.   On agriculture we start from common ground.     The objectives of the Treaty in the field of agriculture are similar to our own.     We,like you, are committed to the maintenance of a stable, efficient andprosperous agriculture.    The Treaty aims at increasing agriculturalproductivity, a fair standard of living for the agricultural population,stable markets, regular supplies and reasonable prices and supplies to consumers.     These objectives command our support.     We are now prepared to take the major step of participating with you in a common agricultural policy and in the development of a common organisation ofagricultural markets.     We accept that the Common Market must extend to agriculture.    Dut this poses big problems for us.    Cur system of support is very different from the methods to which you are accustomed.We have a system of Annual Reviews and guaranteed prices which weare obliged to maintain during the life time of the present Parliament.This system enables changes to be made gradually and with due regardto the effect of these changes on the level of farm income.    In moving towards your methods of support we should have to make great changesaffecting both producers and consumers.     But, provided we can seethat in future with the new methods decided upon we are able to maintainthe stability and living standards of our farmers, I believe that theproblems raised for us can be overcome.     We are encouraged by the recognition which the Treaty itself gives to the importance of ensuring that changes in agriculture take place gradually.     If the necessary changesin the United Kingdom are to be introduced without harmful effects,there must be an adequate transitional period.     We think that it should,where necessary, continue for 12-15 years from when we join, although we hope that we may be able to reduce this period in some cases.15.   It will be difficult to judge how the changes to be made will affectthe standard of living of our farmers.    We therefore regard it of the utmost importance that      we should continue to be able to use such means as are necessary to safeguard our farmers&apos; standard of living.     Theimportance of maintaining the standard of living is clearly acknowledgedin the Treaty and we hope to be able to establish with you arrangements
which will enable us to assure our farmers that the development of tn^common agricultural policy will effectively protect their standard ofliving.16.    The United Kingdom Government are also pledged to ensure for horticulture a measure of support equivalent to that given to theagricultural industry generally.     In the United Kingdom we mainly rely on the tariff as the instrument of support for horticulture and not, as for agriculture generally, on direct Exchequer subvention.     You will therefore appreciate that the adoption of a common policy for horticulturewill face us with some particularly complex problems.    The problemof the removal of our tariffs on imports from the Community countriescannot be considered in isolation from your own existing arrangements and from those which may be made for these producers in the common agricultural policy.     We shall therefore need to devise, in consultationwith you, arrangements for the different horticultural products  whichwill enable the United Kingdom Government to continue to implement itspledges to horticulture.European Free. Trade Aos Delation17.     It has long been our view that the present division of Europe into two economic groups should be brought to an end.     We believe that theother members of the European Free Trade Association have a significant parts play in Europe.    Some of them have already applied for membership.The neutral countries, however, consider that for political reasons theycannot apply for full membership but we believe that they should beallowed to find an appropriate relationship with the Community.    Givenour obligations to our partners in the European Free Trade Association, theUnited Kingdom Government would not be able to join the Communityuntil ways have been found to meet their legitimate interests.     Webelieve that this can be achieved by a separate arrangement between eachof the remaining countries of the European Free Trade Association who do not become full members of the European Economic Community, and the enlarged Community.     There is no question, however, of the UnitedKingdom seeking to maintain for itself a trade relationship with other european Free Trade Association countries in any way different from thatwhich would be enjoyed by all other members of the enlarged Community.FinlandId.    Something should be done, in due course, to enable Finland to preserve her commercial links with &quot;Western Europe.The Irish Republic19-    We are pleased to see that the Irish Republic have applied for membership.    If this application is approved, then the problem of our special trading arrangements with the Irish Republic will be solved.-5-
Conclusion20.     &quot;Xhe application we have made for membership, if it raisesdifficulties, at the same tirrie presents us all with a great opportunityfor new advances together.     The United Kingdom Government willregard the successful conclusion of the negotiations as a point of departure, not as the end of the road.     The present dangers whichconfront the Free World generally, and Europe in particular, are anadded spur to us in seeking a new step forward in European unity.     Ican imagine no better way of counter-acting the anxieties to whichrecent events in the international field gave rise than by makingrapid progress with the task we are now undertaking.    An early succesin this would compel our adversaries to treat tis all with new respect.It would encourage all who believe in the future of free peoples.    TheUnited Kingdom Delegation will spare no effort to bring the negotiations to an early and successful conclusion.October, 1961-6-
