C. (61) 19328th November, 1961.CABINETCHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since 1951 any discussion and vote in the United Nations as to whether theNationalist regime in Formosa should continue to occupy the Chinese seat orwhether it should go to the Chinese People&apos;s Government in Peking has been avoided by the moratorium procedure. Over the years this procedure has hadless and less support and some months ago the Americans and ourselves agreedthat it would be unwise to try it again. On 5th September the Cabinet approvedmy proposal in C. (61) 131 to support an American-engineered proposal that thequestion of any change in Chinese representation should be declared &quot; an importantitem&quot; (C.C. (61) 49th Conclusions, Minute 4). This would mean that no changecould take place without a two-thirds majority.2. In agreeing to support this move we emphasised to the Americans thatit would be necessary to make it clear in the United Nations that it was not intended simply as a device to continue to deny the Chinese People&apos;s government seat in the United Nations. The Cabinet agreed that in the light of our recognitionof Peking, of public and Parliamentary opinion here, and of our general position that China was better in the United Nations than out of it, we should make it clearthat our support for the United States proposal was contingent upon a furtherproposal. That was the United States would find sponsors for a motion that a united Nations commission or study group be set up forthwith to examine thewhole question of Chinese representation and to make recommendations. TheUnited States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, agreed to this.3. The question is likely to come up in the United Nations very soon. the americans have now told us that they are confident of the required support tomake any change in Chinese representation an &quot; important item &quot; but that theyhave not yet been able to find any sponsor for the second resolution, upon which our support for the first is dependent, that is to say for the establishment of a study group or commission. The effect of this upon our position is being studiedseparately.4. The proposal to make the question an &quot; important item &quot; may not be acceptable to the Assembly. In that case it is possible that the Assembly willturn to the resolution which the Soviet Union has already put down (text annexed)which has the effect of putting to a straight vote the point whether Peking orFormosa should occupy the Chinese seat. We have told the Americans all alongthat while we do not want to have to vote on such a resolution (since we have no interest in seeing the Formosan regime expelled from the United Nations) if theirmanoeuvre fails and there is no alternative to a straight vote we shall have to vote for Peking.5. The question has arisen whether, if we were faced with such a possibility,we could cast our vote for Peking without making any reservation as to theposition of Formosa.6. Until the Peace Treaty with Japan of 1951 sovereignty over Formosawas vested in Japan.  By that treaty she renounced all &quot; right, title and claim toCopy No.60032THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1961
Foreign Office, S.W.1,27th November, 1961.Formosa &quot;, but neither that treaty nor any subsequent treaty has vested sovereignty in any other Power. The legal position therefore is that Formosa is a territorysovereignty over which is undetermined. Lord Avon, then Foreign secretary sir Anthony Eden, made a statement in the House of Commons in February 1955to that effect. The Nationalist Chinese regime is thus only in de facto occupationof the island. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are under no obligation either toGeneral Chiang Kai-shek or to his regime.&apos;j 7. Of the roughly 10 million inhabitants of Formosa the Nationalist Chineseare in a minority of about 1 to 4. The 8 to 9 million indigenous Formosans donot, to the best of our knowledge, wish to be ruled by China, either Nationalistor Communist. While therefore we are under no obligation to do anything to preserve Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s regime in Formosa, or a fortiori his claim to representChina in the United Nations, we have at least a moral obligation to the indigenouspeople of Formosa to do what we can to prevent them from falling into the handsof Communist China.8. If we had no alternative but to vote for the Soviet resolution our vote,if unqualified as regards Formosa, would rightly or wrongly be taken by someof our friends, certainly the Americans and the Australians and probably others, asan abandonment of the people of Formosa. What is more, the Chinese would maintain that, by voting for their admission to the United Nations, we acceptedtheir contention that they are the Government of all China including Formosa.The fact that  this argument would not be legally well based would not prevent it from being put forward; it would bedevil our relations, on the one hand with china and on the other with the Americans and others of our friends, for years tocome. At home, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be severely censured inParliament and by public opinion if they allowed the impression to be gained thatin their desire to see Communist China seated in the United Nations they wereprepared to sacrifice the non-Communist people of Formosa.9. I have therefore instructed Her Majesty&apos;s Representative at the united nations that if the United States manoeuvre described in paragraph 1 above shouldfail, he is to give discreet support to any other reasonable proposal, other than a moratorium, which the Americans or others may canvass in order to avoid a straight vote on the Soviet resolution. If, however, it is impossible to avoid this he is to vote for that resolution making the following statement:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom vote for this resolution because they believe that the Chinese People&apos;s Republic should beseated in the United Nations as the representatives of the State of China. Thisis the sense of the Soviet proposal. I wish, however, to make it clear that inthe view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government sovereignty over the island of Formosais undetermined. It therefore follows in Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs viewthat the question as to who should represent Formosa in the United Nations isalso undetermined. The vote which I cast in favour of this resolution doesnot prejudice the position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on this point.&quot;H.
