confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1961C(61)182 Copy No.     .518th November, 1961 1CABINETTRADE WITH POLANDMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food in his memorandum (C (61) 181) the President of the Board of Trade seeksapproval to a proposal to increase the quotas for Polish bacon and other commodities during the current year in return for a Polish offer to purchase british aircraft valued at around  If millions.2. The Cabinet last discussed the Polish bacon question on the 1st Augustwhen I was concerned only with the President^ proposal to give an undertaking to increase the Polish bacon quota over a period of six or seven years (OC (61) 46thConclusions, Minute 7). Since that time the bacon market has drasticallydeteriorated. A growing quantity of bacon has been offered on our market andas a result the price has collapsed. This has led to lower returns to exporting countries and a substantial rise in the cost of our guarantees for pigs, which nowlooks like being more than  30 millions for this year compared with  20 millionslast year. Our main suppliers are the Danes and their breeding herd is- now20 per cent, higher than it was last year. This is bound to be reflected in even greater pressure on the United Kingdom market in the months ahead.3. The collapse in price led the British Bacon Curers&apos; Federation to apply inSeptember for anti-dumping duties on bacon imports from the Irish Republic,who at present prices are subsidising their exports. This application is still beingconsidered by the Board of Trade, but whatever the outcome of it, I am sure itwill be necessary to try in the interests both of ourselves and exporting countries to seek a general reduction in bacon supplies to our market by the voluntary agreement of all suppliers, including Poland and Denmark.4. To increase the Polish quota at this time would make any such agreementquite impossible, and we would be faced with continuing supplies from abroadat levels which the market cannot take up at anything like reasonable prices.There are, therefore, two alternatives open to us. One is to seek to get a voluntary agreement from all suppliers to reduce their exports to a level which wouldstabilise our market, or alternatively to increase the quota from Poland and face a long period of unrealistic prices and high costs to the Exchequer. To translatethese two alternatives in terms of the effect upon Poland is as follows. We believethat for a voluntary agreement to be effective it would be necessary for allexporting countries to agree to reduce their supplies for the next six months byabout 5 per cent. This would mean the Poles exporting to us some 28,500 tons,instead of the 30,000 tons which they still have within their present quota. I am advised that the effect would be to raise the estimated average market price inthis country to about 250s. per cwt. for Polish bacon. At this level the Poleswould be earning from us  7-125 millions. If, however, we were to increase theirquota by 4,000 tons to 34,000 tons for the remainder of the quota year, the pricecould well fall to 210s. per cwt. or even lower. At this level the Poles would earn a total return of  7 -14 millions so they would gain virtually nothing in terms ofadditional sterling income. I therefore cannot see any advantage in increasingthe Polish quota.59954
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W.1,7th November, 1961.&apos; 5. On the other hand, I can see grave disadvantage:&apos;1 We cannot allow the bacon market to drift on in its present deplorable state without taking some action. And to inhibit ourselves from taking proper action by increasing the quota to an Eastern State would not be readily Understood by our curers, ourbacon pig producers or our friends in West Europe who are vitally interested inthe United Kingdom market. We should also have wilfully abandoned the^Opportunity of securing a rise in bacon prices through a voluntary reduction ofsupplies and the chance of saving the Exchequer as a result about  2 millions inthe current financial year and about  7 millions in a full financial year. &quot;., ....6. I must ask my colleagues to agree that it would make no sense to increasethe Polish bacon quota.C. S.
