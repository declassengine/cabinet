ANNEXDECISIONS ON CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL labour conventions AND RECOMMENDATIONSText of Proposed White PaperInternational Labour Conventions and RecommendationsThere are set out below the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on aConvention and Recommendation adopted by the International LabourConference at its 44th Session in 1960 and a Convention and Recommendationadopted at the 45th Session in 1961. The texts of these instruments were presented to Parliament in Cmnd. 1189 and Cmnd. 1514 respectively.The  Radiation Protection  Convention (No.   115) and Recommendation(No. 114)The Convention applies to all activities involving exposure of workers toionising radiations in the course of their work, except where exemption isgiven owing to the limited doses of ionising radiations which can be received.It provides that every effort shall be made to restrict such exposure to the lowest practicable level. Maximum permissible doses of ionising radiationsare to be fixed at appropriate levels for workers directly engaged in radiationwork who are aged 18 and over and for those under 18 and also for workersnot directly engaged in such work but who remain or pass where they maybe subject to exposure. No worker under 16 is to be engaged in radiationwork. Provision is made for the use of warnings and for instructionconcerning precautions, for the notification of work involving exposure ofworkers to ionising radiations, for monitoring to ascertain that the levelsapplicable are respected and for inspection. The action to be taken inemergencies is prescribed. Workers directly engaged in radiation work areto undergo medical examinations, and no worker is to be employed in work by reason of which he could be subject to exposure to ionising radiationscontrary to qualified medical advice.The Convention provides for these protective measures to be appliedprogressively. A Government ratifying the Convention undertakes to do whatis appropriate to ensure the effective protection of workers. To this end, all measures adopted after ratification must comply with the provisions of theConvention and a Government must modify, as soon as practicable, measuresit has previously adopted, so as to comply, and promote a similar modificationof other existing measures. Effect may be given to the Convention by meansof laws or regulations, codes of practice or other appropriate means.The purpose of the Recommendation is to assist in the practical applicationof the Convention. It covers in greater detail matters dealt with in theConvention and includes sections on maximum permissible levels, theappointment of a competent person to deal with questions of protection,60128
methods of protection, monitoring, medical examination, inspection andnotification, and co-operation of employers and workers.In the United Kingdom advances in scientific knowledge and the practical application of new techniques have led in recent years to an increased useof materials and apparatus giving rise to a hazard from ionising radiations,and this trend will no doubt continue. The Government have throughoutgiven close attention to the problems of health and safety which have thusarisen and considerable experience has been gained in dealing with them.Safeguards have been introduced partly by means of legislation andadministrative measures and partly through voluntary action. Earlier thisyear the Ionising Radiations (Sealed Sources) Regulations were made underthe Factories Acts and at the present time several other new or revisedmeasures are in course of preparation. In so far as existing measures dealwith matters provided for in the Convention there is no conflict with its provisions. The Government intend that future measures shall comply withthe Convention, and that its progressive application will thus be secured.They therefore propose to ratify the Convention. In applying it they intend tohave full regard to the terms of the Recommendation, which they accept asa useful supplement to the Convention.The Final Articles Revision Convention (No. 116)This Convention provides for the revision of the article in conventions adopted at the first 32 sessions of the International Labour Conference which requires the Governing Body to make a report to the Conference on theworking of each Convention at fixed intervals of either 5 or 10 years. Its effect will be that, as with more recent Conventions, the reports will be made only when the Governing Body considers them necessary.Member States have always had an obligation to report on Conventionsthey have ratified, but it was not until the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation was amended in 1948 that the Governing Body wasgiven power to request reports on unratified Conventions. This has made possible far more comprehensive reviews of the working of Conventions than before, and the rigid procedure laid down in the earlier Conventions hasbecome obsolete and burdensome. The Government therefore welcome thisConvention, and propose to ratify it.The Workers&apos; Housing Recommendation (No. 115)The Recommendation sets out general principles which &quot; each Membershould, within the framework of its general social and economic policy, giveeffect to ... in such manner as may be appropriate under nationalconditions&quot;. It is accompanied by suggestions concerning methods of application of the general principles by which it is stated that Member States&quot; and the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned should be guidedto the extent possible and desirable &quot;.The Recommendation applies to &quot; the housing of manual and non-manual workers, including those who are self-employed and aged, retired or physicallyhandicapped persons&quot;. In a section dealing with objectives of nationalhousing policy the Recommendation states that &quot; it should be an objective ofnational policy to promote, within the framework of general housing policy,the construction of housing and related community facilities with a view to
ensuring that adequate and decent housing accommodation and a suitableliving environment are made available to all workers and their families &quot;.There are further sections dealing with the responsibility of public authorities,housing provided by employers, financing, housing standards, measures topromote efficiency in the building industry, house building and employmentstabilisation, and town, country and regional planning.In the United Kingdom the basic objective of the Governments housing policy is to ensure that, as soon as possible, everyone, whether or not withinthe definition of &quot; worker &quot; in the Recommendation, has an &quot; adequate anddecent&quot; home to live in; and existing housing and town and country planninglegislation covers, in a manner appropriate to conditions in this country, thegeneral principles in the Recommendation which are the concern of governments. The Government therefore accept the Recommendation. they also agree that in giving it practical effect account should be taken of the considerations set out in the accompanying suggestions concerning methodsof application.December 1961
