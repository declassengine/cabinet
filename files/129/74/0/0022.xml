1^8f secret(55) 7215th March, 1955CABINETUNITED STATES AID FOR PAKISTANMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI am sorry to trouble my colleagues on a point of detail affectingUnited States Aid shipments of raw cotton, particularly since the principleof the 50/50 shipping condition will be considered by the Economic PolicyCommittee shortly in connection with our own Aid Agreement with the americans,,    The matter is, however, of great urgency.    Within thenext few days, the Pakistan Government may announce that they have placed orders for cotton textiles, under an Aid Agreement with the UnitedStates to which other countries have agreed in principle,,    We must decidebefore that happens whether we too could agree in principle, otherwiseLancashire will be prevented from obtaining a share of the business.The circumstances are as follows,2,        Part of the American aid for Pakistan this year is being givenin the form of surplus agricultural commodities.     The United States and pakistan Governments have agreed that Pakistan should invite worldtenders for cotton textiles, payment to be made by delivery to the supply-ing country of surplus United States cotton,    A number of United kingdom firms have put in bids and there is a chance of doing S*2 millions worth of business on a Lancashire estimate or $5 millions according to anestimate from Karachi,,    Following a discussion in the Economic PolicyCommittee on 1st March, consultations are proceeding with the americans and with Lancashire on the arrangements which must be made for importing United States cotton under certain special procedures and forconverting the imports of United States cotton into cash which can bepaid to the United Kingdom manufacturers of the textiles which are goingto Pakistan,3,        No progress can be made until a question of principle has beendecided.    Under United States cargo preference legislation, 50 per cent of the imports of cotton must be carried in United States ships.    Theproblems which this requirement will raise for United States aid to theUnited Kingdom this year have been discussed in the Economic PolicyCommittee,    It was then decided that the requirement should be acceptedon transactions which gave aid to the United Kingdom or to the Colonies;and that where aid to third countries was concerned each case should beconsidered on its merits (E^A.,(55) 5th Meeting, Item 2, Conclusion (3))0No distinction was made as to whether the aid transactions were coveredby the Mutual Security Act (P, L, 665) or by the Agricultural Trade andDevelopment Act (P.L. 480),4,        The import of United States cotton, which will pay for textilesexported to Pakistan, is in fact a transaction involving aid to a thirdcountry, iQe, to Pakistan, and it is necessary to consider on the meritsCOPY NO.(q 5 

of the case whether tha 50 per cent shipping requirement can be acceptedso far as cotton is concerned.    In my view it is acceptable for thefollowing reasonsa-(a) The transaction would be of considerable value to theUnited Kingdom itself by enabling Lancashire textilemanufacturers to obtain orders they would otherwisenot receive.    Moreover, if they do not get orders under this aid transaction, they will not be able to export any textiles to Pakistan for the duration of thistransaction.    It would be very damaging to a long-standing traditional trade to have a complete stoppage of business in this way,(b) The third country which is being aided in this case is amember of the Commonwealth and a very poor one,(c) Under the normal pattern of cotton shipments from theUnited States to the United Kingdom, about half the cargoes are carried in United States ships so that inpractice the provision would not deprive our shipowners of business they would have obtained.For these reasons I consider that we should agree that this is a transaction ip. which it would be justifiable to accept the 50 per centrequirement,5,        The United States authorities are currently seeking a ruling asto whether the 50 per cent provision should apply to the second leg of the transaction - namely, the shipment of textiles to Pakistan,    If the rulingis given that it does so apply, I would of course agree that this would be entirely unacceptable and we should have to abandon the whole transaction.P TBoard of Trade, S0W.l,14-Sh March, 1955.
