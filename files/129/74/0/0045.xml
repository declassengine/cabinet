immoral would inevitably reduce their deterrent value as a whole.    It wouldbe fatal to give the impression that as long as no hydrogen bomb was dropped on Allied territory, none would be used against Russia, or that the only likelyvictims of nuclear weapons in a new global war would be the armed forces and not the civilian populations or centres of government&apos;and industry.Moreover, for the deterrent to achieve its maximum effect, the Russians mustbe left in no doubt that the use against the West of any of their nuclear weaponswould immediately bring upon them retaliation from the whole Allied armoury.conclusions. The time is coming when the Western forces will only beable to fight a global war with nuclear weapons.    The decision to use these weapons will remain under political control.7. It is not possible to draw any definite dividing line betweensmall and large nuclear weapons.    Even if it were possible to do so, itwould be gravely against our interests, because it would reduce theirdeterrent value and would encourage the Russians to think that they might beable to resort to aggression without receiving the full weight of Alliedretaliation.Re commendations-   8. We seek the agreement of our colleagues to these views and recommend that we should j-(i)  seek through the Canadian High commissioner in London the agreement to them of theCanadian Government;(ii)  subsequently, and provided the canadian government agree, jointly represent themto the United States Government.\A*E..H.M,5th April, 1955.
27SANNEX IFROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN office sir R0 MakinsNo. 588March 16, 1955Atomic Weapons.I understand from Mr. Streibert, director of the UnitedStates Information Agency, that the United States Administration have been considering the impact on world public opinion of recent authoritativeexplanations about the implications of nuclear weapons.    They consider it essential that the prohibitively destructive nature of hydrogen and other bombs,on which we rely so heavily as a deterrent against aggressive war, should be properly and widely understood.    But the very success of this educativecampaign, much advanced by the Prime Minister^ recent speech, makes it increasing necessary to complement the picture by making the world publicrealise that science has also evolved smaller and more precise tacticalatomic weaponsj which can legitimately be used in the framework ofconventional armaments and minor wars, and are indeed less destructiveof civilian life and property than the. mass pattern bombing of the last war.The Administration considers this particularly important, both in the context of the decision to supply N.A.T.O. forces with -tactical atomic weapons, andalso of their possible use in the Far East.2. Mr. Dulles launched this campaign yesterday at a press conference, where he spoke of the advantages of small nuclear weapons used against military targets.    lie considered that the likelihood of using city-destroying bombs in a war decreased as the availability of smaller atomic weapons went up.    These relatively small and precise nuclear weaponscould select and destroy military targets and produced no radio-active fall-out.The President followed this up at his weekly Press conference to-day by saying that he could see no reason for not using tactical atomic weapons againststrictly military targets &quot;just as bullets would be used&quot;.3. The suggestion has been made on the American side thatspokesman for Her Majesty&apos;s Government should also consider taking suitableopportunities to make clear the technical and moral justification of the tactical nuclear weapons with which allied forces are now being equipped.
ANNEX IIINWARD TELEGRAM TO COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICEFROM:  U.K. HIGH C OMMISSIONE R IN CANADADULLES VISIT   -  DEFENCEDulles said he was constantly stressing the distinctionbetween tactical atomic (? weapons) and the hydrogen bomb.    United Statedefence forces and policy were now based on use of small atomic weapons.Reliance on conventional weapons would be hopelessly costly.2. Pearson said Canadians were realising that Canada would inevitably be involved in international trouble even where no Canadiancommitments were involved.    This worried Canadian public opinion andwould lead to more agitation for having a voice in important decisions.Prior consultation with its allies by the United States was more desirablethan ever.    Dulles said he consulted constantly with United linngdom andalso with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.    Lately he had consultedFrancs less owing to French irresponsibility.
