secret(55) 61 COPY NO.?mu March,, 1955CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerIf we let the National Coal Board increase coal prices in the way they propose (as set out in C. (55) 58), I would expect them just about to balance their accounts over a full year from the date of the increaseZ0        I still think the right course is to let the Board do this$ but1st April would now probably be the earliest date by which the necessary consultations with consumers could be completed and the new prices take effect.    The result would be that in the calendar year 1955 (which the Boardbegan with an accumulated, deficit from past years of  17 millions) theymight earn a surplus of  7f millions and in 1956 one of  if millions a thus reducing their accumulated deficit to  8 millions by the end of 1956.    Their3.        However, when the Economic Policy Committee were considering this matter on 3rd March and some of my colleagues expressed doubts aboutthe wisdom of allowing a price increase which might yield a surplus at theend of either 1955 or 1956, I mentioned the alternative of asking the board to make the price increase on coal other than house coal 10 per cent insteadof IZ-f per cent,.    The Committee invited me to bring this alternative to thenotice of the Cabinet after consulting the Board on various points that had arisen in discussion.40        I have now had further consultations with Sir Hubert Houldsworthand some of his colleagues on the Board and my conclusions are as follows05.        As regards exports, I think that all the Departments concerned should reconsider the question whether exports should be maintained at thepresent level in the face of our continuing need for imports?  but? whatever the decision might be, it could have no material effect on the Board&apos;s finances,in 1955u    Of the 11 million tons of exports planned the Board have alreadysold 8 millions and most of the balance of 3 millions will be needed to meetunavoidable commitments^ e.g. to Eire0    Moreover, the Board haverecently been able to increase their export prices by up to 10/- a ton andtheir financial estimates allow for this additional profit on the tonnageremaining to be sold06.       As to the possibility of modifying the proposed increases in favourof transport and the trawlers, I am afraid this could only be done either by a flat rate increase on all industrial coals (instead of a percentage one) or else by discriminatory increases.    In either case we should be goingagainst our policy of ensuring that prices of industrial coals reflect qualitydifferences and we should create as maivy grievances as we removed,
7S        As to the soundness of the Board!s forward estimates^ I havesatisfied myself once again that they are reasonable and likely to prove asgood a guide as cn previous occasions when they have been accurate withinmargins of less than one per cent,80        There are, I suggest, only two alternatives before us a.agenda in theattached table, I set out the financial effects of both0    Whichever alternativewere adopted,, the Board*s announcement would be en $he following  latest-&apos;&apos;I^a^ona-l Coal Board Statement on Pi-iceis&quot;The National Coal Board have reviewed the cost of producing andimporting coal and, in order that these costs may be covered by sellingpriceSj they have decided, after consultation with the Industrial and DomesticCoal Consumers5 Councils, that pithead prices of coal, other than housecoal, should be increased by      per cento    The costs to be covered includethe cost of safety and health measures, including those required by the newMines and Quarries Act, the settlement which the Board hope to reach withthe National Union of Mine workers on wages and the reorganisation of the wage structure, the financing of the increased extent and pace of reconstruction, and the cost of importing coal,,&quot;The Board have reached these decisions after taking into account the views expressed to them by Her Majesty&apos;s Government about theimportance in the public interest of seeking to avoid the direct increase.se inthe cost of living that would follow the raising of house coal prices.    Thusthere would be no increase in the price of the average and lower grades of house coal which together constitute some two-thirds of total house coalsuppliesB &quot;9o        I would much prefer to let the Board proceed in due course toissue the above statement with the figure of IZj per cent as the increase for coal other than house coal0    If, however, the Cabinet think that thefigure should be 10 per cent, I ask authority to consult with the Board and,if they agree9 to let them proceed accordingly ands after consultation withconsumers, make their announcement about the middle of March,G0 l-&quot;oMinistry of Fuel and Power, S0 W0105th March, 1955,
