Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1955SECRETC. (55) 7422nd March, 1955CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS DISQUALIFICATION bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsThe chaotic and illogical state of the law governing disqualification from membership of the House of Commons of holders of &quot; offices or places of profit under the Crown &quot; has long been the subject of criticism. A Select Committee ofthe House (the &quot; Herbert Committee &quot;) studied the problem in 1941 but no action was taken to implement their recommendations (H. of C, 1941, No. 120). On12th July, 1949, during the debate on the House of Commons Disqualification(Indemnification of Certain Members) Bill, we pressed our predecessors to take some positive action. They agreed to do so, and Sir Frank Soskice had, withthe assistance of a Committee of Officials (the &quot; Soskice Committee &quot;), produced a draft Bill by the time of the General Election.2. This Bill, and the Committee&apos;s report on it, were made available to us by the Opposition in 1952. Since then, under the supervision of the Home AffairsCommittee, the Bill has been revised and its application to the Northern ireland parliament worked out. The recent case of Mr. Niall Macpherson has led tofurther pressure for new legislation.3. The Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (54) 10th Meeting, Minute 2) havegiven general approval to the Bill and invited my predecessor to seek the authorityof the Cabinet for the draft - -(i) to be cleared finally with the Government of Northern Ireland;(ii) to be discussed confidentially with the Opposition with a view to securing their acceptance of it as an agreed measure.I recommend that these consultations should proceed concurrently and that (ii)might start by my inviting Sir Frank Soskice to secure the support and co-operationof those Opposition back-bench Members who have consistently interestedthemselves in the subject.4. A copy of the current draft of the Bill is attached; it differs only indetail from the earlier draft approved by the Home Affairs Committee. The Billis largely a consolidation measure, its main object being to restate in modernlanguage the effect of the existing law. It accordingly makes only such modifications as appear to be required in the&apos;interests of clarity or as a consequenceof the restatement. Many of these changes are of a purely technical nature, but those of more substance and general interest include the following:  (a) statutory disqualification of regular members of police forces (Clause 1(Did));(b) abolition (for the purposes of the &quot; office of profit&quot; disqualification) ofthe present distinction between &quot; new &quot; offices (i.e., those created since1705) and &quot; old &quot; (Clause 1 (1) (g));(c) grant to the House of Commons of power to make orders relieving fromdisqualification any M.P.s who incur it inadvertently an excusalprocedure designed to make Indemnity Bills unnecessary (Clause 8 (2));Copy No. g g47803b
Home Office, S.W.1,17th. March, 1955.ANNEX ACOMMON INFORMERS1. With the exception of those relating to Parliamentary disqualifications, allstatutory provisions authorising the common informer procedure were repealedby the Common Informers Act, 1951. The 1951 Act originated as a private member&apos;s Bill; it did not deal with Parliamentary disqualifications because it was thought that the Government should take responsibility for legislation on mattersof such constitutional importance. During the Second Reading debate on the 1951Bill the Attorney-General of the day announced that a House of Commons;Disqualification Bill was being prepared which would abolish the common informerin the field of the &quot; office of profit &quot; and &quot; contract&apos;&quot; disqualifications. Sir hartley shawcross pointed out that these were the most common disqualifications, and-said,:that he and his colleagues did not contemplate legislation on other disqualificationsbecause these would raise wider and more controversial issues. (House ofCommons. Official Report, 9th February,. 1951, Cols. 2088-2105.);2. It follows that common informer actions can at present be1 maintainedunder the following enactments:  1. The Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, s. 28;2. The Crown Pensioners Disqualification Act, 1715, s. 2;3. The House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1741, s. 2;4. The House of Commons (Disqualification) Act, 1782, s. 9;(d) abolition of the common informer procedure (subject to what is said in    &amp;Annex A below) and institution in its place of a new procedure enablingpossible cases of disqualification to be referred to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council (Clause 9);(e) repeal of a number of statutory provisions disqualifying M.P.s fromholding certain public offices provisions which are no longer neededbecause other parts of the Bill disqualify the holders of these officesfrom membership of the House of Commons (Clause 15,(1) and SeventhSchedule).There are several other important features of the Bill which call for special attention and for which I seek Cabinet approval.   Notes, on these are set out in Annex B.5.   I invite the Cabinet (i) to approve the draft Bill in principle;(ii) to agree that the common informer provisions of the Acts of 1801 and1886 should be left on the Statute Book (see Annex A);(iii) to agree that the Bill should not legislate for the Clergy (Annex B,paragraph 1);(iv) to approve the proposal that, with certain exceptions, Commonwealth and colonial office-holders should not be disqualified (Annex B, paragraphs-5);(v) to agree that no local government officers should be disqualified by theBill (Annex B, paragraphs 6-7);(vi) to agree to the provisions of the Bill relating to Northern Ireland and theIrish Republic (Annex B, paragraphs 8 and 9);(vii) to approve the proposed changes in the law relating to Ministers of Stateand to the number of Ministers permitted to sit and vote in. the Houseof Commons (Annex B, paragraphs 10 to 13 and Annex C);(viii) to authorise confidential discussion of the Bill with the Opposition and,concurrently, with the Government of Northern Ireland.G. LL.-G.
ANNEX BNOTES ON OTHER POINTS REQUIRING decision the Clergy1.   Disqualifications not arising from (a) the holding of &quot; offices of profit&quot; (or of certain &quot; incompatible &quot; offices),(b) the making of certain Crown contracts, or(c) the receipt of certain Crown pensions.are outside the scope of the Bill. This is because such disqualifications (e.g., thoseof aliens, bankrupts, felons, &amp;c.) are, with one exception, fairly certain in their operation. The exception is the disqualification of certain members of the Clergy.Following the case of the late Rev. J. G. Macmanaway, a Select Committee of theHouse considered the whole problem of clergy disqualifications but recommendedthat there should be no action in advance of general legislation. (H. of C, 1953,No. 200.) In view of the doubts expressed both by the Herbert Committee(paragraph 61 of their report) and by the Archbishop of Canterbury (in evidence before the Select Committee on Clergy Disqualifications) the Home AffairsCommittee agreed with the proposal that, in spite of various unsatisfactory anddoubtful features of the existing law, the present Bill should not attempt to legislate for the Clergy. If the Cabinet endorse this decision a common informer penaltyprovision will have to be retained. Comments on common informers generally are contained in Annex A.The Colonies and Commonwealth2. On Second Reading of the Niall Macpherson Indemnity Bill there was some discussion of the suggestion that instead of an Indemnity Bill there shouldbe a Bill enabling Members of Parliament to hold any office under commonwealth governments. (Official Report, 11th May, 1954, Cols. 1157-1194.) Paragraphs 1and 5 of the Third Schedule follow closely the corresponding provisions of thedraft Bill inherited from the Opposition. Their effect, coupled with that of clause 1 (4), is to limit the scope of the &quot; paid offices &quot; disqualification to office-holders appointed either by Her Majesty or by United Kingdom Ministers or government Departments. In general, therefore, the Bill does not disqualify office-holders in the Colonies or self-governing Commonwealth countries-a result whichwas apparently intended by the Opposition when they first prepared the Bill. TheSoskice Committee did not consider that office-holders from the Colonies or commonwealth countries should be eligible to sit at Westminster; but in view ofthe physical obstacles to such membership they thought it unnecessary, and undesirable, to legislate expressly to disqualify them.3. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations considers that inprinciple the officers of self-governing Commonwealth countries and members ofthe Forces of those countries should not be disqualified; and at his request Clause 1contains express provisions, which make it clear that no part of the clause extend to such officers or Forces.478031(1&apos; 5.   The House of Commons (Clergy Disqualification) Act, 1801, s. 2;6.   The House of Commons (Disqualifications) Act, 1801, s. 6;7.   The House of Commons Disqualifications Act, 1821, s. 2;8.   The Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1836, s. 18;9.   The Lunacy (Vacating of Seats) Act, 1886, s. 2.Of these enactments, all except numbers 5 and 9 are repealed in whole or inpart by the Bill, and no further question arises on them. Numbers 5 and 9 do not come within the scope of the Bill, which is limited to disqualifications arising fromthe holding under the Crown of paid offices, contracts and pensions. Accordinglyin these two cases only the common informer must survive.
4. With regard to the Colonies and other territories under Colonial Officejurisdiction (and also the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland) the effect of theBill is substantially similar, except that Colonial Governors, being appointed byThe Queen, are disqualified by Clause 1 (1) (g) and paragraph 1 of the third schedule. Members of the public services, though selected by the Secretary ofState, are appointed by the Governments of the territories in which they serve andso are not disqualified by the &quot; paid office &quot; provisions of the Bill. The termsof Clause 1 (1) (b) and 1 (1) (c) make it clear that such people are not part of &quot; thecivil service of the Crown &quot; or covered by the armed forces disqualification (as thecase may be). The Bill does, however, disqualify certain classes of office-holdersto whom the physical obstacles referred to at 2 above do not apply.   These are:  (i) the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrationsappointed by the Secretary of State and therefore covered by clause 1 (1) (g);(ii) the staffs of the Crown Agents;(iii) the Agents in this country of certain individual Colonial and other terri-tories and their staffs;(iv) the staffs of the Oversea (formerly Colonial) Audit Department and theColonial Income Tax Office.Groups (ii) and (iv) above are covered by Clause 14 (3) and entries in the second schedule.5. The draft Bill does not disqualify the directors and senior executives ofpublic corporations in Colonial territories, because there seems no possibility ofthe kind of improper financial influence against which paragraph 2 of the third schedule is directed. Nor does there appear to be incompatibility of the kind which applies to comparable posts on or under the various public boards in the UnitedKingdom.Local Government Officers6. At present Town Clerks and Town Clerks Depute in Scotland and allcounty council staffs in England and Wales are disqualified. Our predecessorsintended to repeal the latter disqualification and to enact a new disqualificationcovering the clerks and deputy clerks of all local authorities in Great Britain,because these officials have to give impartial advice, procedural rulings, &amp;c, totheir councils-often in public, in the council chamber and should not, therefore,be known adherents to a political party. A general disqualification of localauthority clerks and deputy clerks would be supported by the associations of localauthorities in Scotland, and the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with their view. The disqualification is at present in the Bill (Second Schedule, page 13,lines 1 to 11) following the decision of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (54)10th. Meeting, Minute 2).7. The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Home Secretaryask the Cabinet to reverse this decision. Senior local government officials should be politically impartial, but it is neither necessary nor right for the present bill to legislate to that end. First, it would seldom be physically possible for a localgovernment official to combine his duties as such with membership of the Houseof Commons. Secondly, it can quite properly be left to the local authorities them-selves, by imposition of appropriate conditions of service, to prevent their officialstaking part in political activities. Thirdly, it would be difficult to justify the distinction between clerks and deputy clerks and the other senior local governmentofficers (in whom political impartiality is just as necessary). Finally, informal soundings suggest that the English local authority associations would be opposedto a disqualification of this kind. The Cabinet are therefore asked to agree thatthe existing.disqualifications of certain local government officers should be repealed;and that no new disqualifications should be enacted.Northern Ireland *8. By Section. 18 (2) of, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the law for thetime being in force relating to disqualifications from membership of the House ofCommons at Westminster is applied to both Houses of the Parliament of NorthernIreland, At the request of the Government of Northern Ireland, and with theagreement of the Home Affairs Committee, the current draft of the Bill (see
ANNEX CNOTE ON CLAUSE 2 (2) AND THE FOURTH SCHEDULEPurposes of Clause 2 (2)1. Sub-section (2) of Clause 2, read with the Fourth Schedule, has threepurposes: -   v &apos;     ...,,,,........ ,,. v,; ,   \Z&apos;sZ(i) It imposes a limit of 70 on the total number of Ministers who may sit inthe House of Commons (Clause 2 (2) (a)).(ii) Within this limit of 70 it imposes a further limit of 27 on the numberof senior Ministers who may sit in the House of Commons(Clause 2 (2) (b)).Clause 12 and Sixth Schedule) departs from these arrangements in the followinglespects:- ,(a) a &quot;paid office or place under the Crown&quot; will not in future&quot;disqualifyat Stormont unless the holder was appointed by the Governor ofNorthern Ireland or by or on the advice of a Northern Ireland minister or Department (in which event there will be no &quot;paid office&quot;disqualification at Westminster);(b) similar restrictions  will apply  to the &quot;contract&quot; and ,&quot; pension &quot;disqualifications;(c) the Northern Ireland Parliament will have a new power to legislate forthe disqualification of holders of any new &quot; incompatible&quot; officescreated by Northern Ireland legislation;(d) each House of the Northern Ireland Parliament will have power to excuseany of its Members who may become inadvertently disqualified.The Bill also clarifies a point of doubt under existing law by declaring that eachof the Northern Ireland Houses has power to declare seats vacant. cabinet approval of these provisions is sought.Irish Republic9. At the request of the Government of Northern Ireland, and with theapproval of the Home Affairs Committee, paragraph (e) has been added to clause 1 (1), disqualifying a member of the legislature of any country or territoryoutside the Commonwealth. As aliens are disqualified by existing law, the onlysubstantive effect of the new paragraph is to disqualify members of the Dail fromsitting either at Stormont or at Westminster.Ministers of the Crown: Ministers of State10. The purpose of Clause 2 and the Fourth Schedule (coupled Wltll a numberof repeal entries in the Seventh Schedule) is to modernise and re-enact the existing provisions designed to preserve Ministers of the Crown from the &quot; paid office or place &quot; disqualification and to secure an adequate number of senior Ministers inthe House of Lords. Opportunity has been taken, as part of this tidying-up process,to amend the law relating to Ministers of State and to provide for greater flexibility in the appointment of these Ministers and in their allocation between the two houses of Parliament.11. The object of the Re-election of Ministers Act, 1919 (as qualified by theHouse of Commons Disqualification (Declaration of Law) Act, 1935) is to preserveMinisters of State (and Ministers without Portfolio) from disqualification. In doing so it provides that not more than 3 such Ministers may sit and vote in the Houseof Commons at any one time, and that Ministers of State should be PrivyCounsellors. The present Bill repeals the 1919 and 1935 Acts; but in re-enactingthe exemptions from disqualification it omits the requirement of membership ofthe Privy Council (see the definition of &quot; Minister of State &quot; in Clause 2 (5)).It also abolishes the separate limit of 3 on the number of such Ministers in the commons; but by including Ministers of State within the general list of senior ministers (Part I of the Fourth Schedule) it makes them in future subject to thelimit of 27 (Clause 2 (2) (b)) on the number of senior House of CommonsMinisters. This means that there could in future be more than 3 Ministers ofState in the Commons if that arrangement were thought desirable.A more detailed note on the effect of Clause 2 (2) and the Fourth Scheduleis at Annex C.
(iii)  It removes the existing limits of 3 on the number of Ministers of State   &amp;who may sit in the House of Commons and of 21 on the number ofParliamentary Secretaries who may sit in that House.Each of those provisions is explained in detail below.   The &quot; ministerialoffices &quot; are set out in the Fourth Schedule.Limit of 70 on the total number of Ministers who may sit in the House of Commons(Clause 2 (2) (a)).2. The Herbert Committee recommended that this limit should be 60, but this figure has been increased to 70 to take account of subsequent changes inGovernment structure.Limit of 27 on the number of senior Ministers who may sit in the House ofCommons (Clause 2 (2) (b)).3. The purpose of this limit is to secure that there shall be an adequatenumber of senior Ministers in the House of Lords. The existing law (The ministers of the Crown Act, 1937) was designed to ensure that at least 3 of 22 listed senior ministers should be peers. The proposed provisions are designed to achieve asimilar effect by providing that not more than 27 of the 30 senior Ministers, listed in Part I of the Fourth Schedule shall sit in the House of Commons (i.e., itpreserves the requirement that there must be at least 3 senior Ministers in theHouse of Lords). The figure of 30 is derived from the posts set out in Part I ofthe Fourth Schedule, and from assuming:  (i) that the eighth Secretary of State post remains unfilled;(ii) that the post of Minister of Food is in due course abolished;(iii) that the Government contains at least 3 Ministers of State or Ministerswithout Portfolio. If the number of such Ministers should fall below 3,the total number of posts in Part I of the First Schedule would be lessthan 30; and in that case, if the Government exercised its right to have27 senior Ministers in the House of Commons, there would be fewer than 3 senior Ministers in the House of Lords.Ministers of State (Clause 2 (2) (b)).4. The present law (The Re-election of Ministers Act, 1919) limits thenumber of Ministers of State who may sit in the House of Commons to 3. Theeffect of the new provision would be to remove this limit. This is achieved by including &quot; Ministers of State &quot; in the list of 30 senior Ministers (Part I of theFourth Schedule), of whom not more than 27 may sit in the House of Commons.This would confer a certain element of flexibility in the use of Ministers of State;but any increase beyond 3 in the number of Ministers of State in the House ofCommons could be made only by leaving a senior ministerial post unfilled or by having an additional senior Minister in the House of Lords.Parliamentary Secretaries5. The Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937 provided that out of a total of 25Parliamentary Secretaries whose salaries were payable under that Act, not morethan 21 should sit together jn the House of Commons, thus ensuring that at least4 should be peers. This separate limit is not reproduced in the Bill, because its work is done by the new aggregate limit of 70.
