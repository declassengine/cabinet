zz6Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1955SECRETC. (55) 8326th March, 1955TALKS WITH THE SOVIET union note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues some suggestions about steps for further talks with Soviet Russia.  I should be ready to discuss this question at an early date.2. Meanwhile, an approach is being made to the United States and french governments about the setting up of a working group of officials which mightmeet in London.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,25th March, 1955.TALKS WITH SOVIET RUSSIAStages in reaching an accommodation between East and WestA Foreign Office paper on policy towards Soviet Russia written in 1952reached the conclusion that the process of reaching an accommodation betweenthe East and the West will be long and arduous and is likely to be achieved, if atall, in three stages. The final stage would of course be stability and a genuinesettlement, but this postulated a change in the nature of the Soviet regime, of whichthere is at present no sign. The intermediate stages would be:  (i) the building up of equilibrium between the two blocs.   This can be defined as a state in which the Western leaders, backed by stablepolitical and economic conditions at home and adequate military strength, feel they can talk on terms of equality with the Soviet leaders;(ii) a period of co-existence marked by continuing tension but progressingtowards a modus vivendi. During the phase of co-existence, the Westwould continue firmly and patiently to build up positions of strengthand seek to conclude local and limited settlements on satisfactory terms.Terms of Equality between East and West2. We are this year as close to &quot; terms of equality with the Soviet leaders &apos;as we are likely to be in the foreseeable future. It seems unlikely that with thepassage of time our relative position will improve. On the contrary, once&quot; saturation &quot; in thermo-nuclear weapons is reached, our relative military strengthdeclines even though we may improve our position in conventional weapons. the ratification of the Paris Agreements may represent a high point of Western politicalcohesion. As time goes on, and particularly when the American public realisesthat America is exposed to thermo-nuclear attack from Russia, the coalition may47834Copy No.   R cabinet
be weakened by American movements in the direction of isolation and peripheralstrategy. The Germans are always awkward allies and are likely to be moreawkward after Dr. Adenauer has left the scene; and the French cannot yet.be relied on to maintain a consistent policy.The Dangers of our Present Posture3. Apart from the probability that our relative military^ strength will not increase, we may have to reckon with a further expansion of Communism in theFar East. Nor can we regard as anything but dangerous the present situation inEurope, particularly in Germany. Although the division of Germany, to whichall the Powers have now grown accustomed, is not without its advantages to all of us, even to Soviet Russia, the Russians hold as a hostage the town of Berlin,where a conflagration may flare up at any moment. Furthermore, they haveGerman unity in their gift at any time, and, if they wished, could offer it to theGermans on tempting terms to-morrow. Unless we make a serious effort to reunifyGermany, which the Germans will regard as serious, they will be restive, and cannotbe relied on to resist Russian blandishments. So long as Germany is divided theattachment of Western Germany to the Western Group will be precarious.Nature of East I West Talks4. The Western Powers have all repeatedly declared their desire to talk to soviet Russia once the Paris Agreements are ratified. It follows from the foregoingarguments that we should aim at talks seriously intended to bring results even ofa limited character rather than at talks which would be no more than a propagandaexercise. Nevertheless, serious talks ought so to be engaged in that, if they breakdown, Soviet Russia may be shown to be at fault.Level of Talks5. It being clear that the Americans will not at present agree to talks at thehighest level, talks at the Foreign Ministers&apos; level should be proposed.Framework for the Talks6. Western public opinion expects talks of an all-embracing character,designed to lead to overall accommodation between East and West. Conversely,Western opinion would be dissatisfied with negotiations which appeared to bedeliberately restricted and of limited scope. But talks of an all-embracingcharacter could hardly be undertaken without the Communist Chinese; theRussians would insist on them coming. If the Chinese came, the Americans mightwell refuse to come themselves. The whole project might then collapse.Accordingly it is desirable to devise if possible an agenda which will justify the exclusion of China, but which will not rule out a discussion of a general character.The Agenda7. (a) Disarmament and the Hydrogen bomb. The prospect of any agreement is so remote that discussion on these issues would be better avoided forthe time being. But since these issues are so fundamental to the relaxation of tension, we should hope, by achieving settlements on other and narrower issues toprepare the ground for a subsequent accommodation.(b) Far East. Here again the prospects of any agreement betweenAmerica and Red China are remote. In view of the present state of opinion in both countries, a settlement this year appears impossible. 1956 is an Americanelection year. 1957 is far away in the future. Therefore having regard to these considerations and to the difficulty caused by the existence of two Chinas it wouldbe better not to put the Far East on the agenda.(c) Europe. European problems seem to offer the only possibility of fruitfuldiscussion this year. A paper is attached setting out some general reflections onthe line which the Western Powers might take.conclusion.   It is suggested that the best agenda to propose might be:-(a) Austria, Germany and European Security;(b) a study of the ways and means of dealing with all other issues outstandingbetween East and West.
PROPOSALS ON EUROPE WHICH THE WESTERN POWERS might make AT A FOUR POWER conference a. AustriaWe should endeavour to give the Austrian issue first place since, having at berlin offered to sign the Austrian Treaty with the Soviet text of all disagreedarticles, the Western Powers are on excellent ground. The Western Powers might also be prepared to go further to meet Soviet demands by giving additionalguarantees against an Anschluss.If, and only if, there was good reason to think that the Russians were readyto conclude a Treaty on such terms, the Western Powers might further agree toconsider the military and political neutralisation of Austria.B. GermanyOur situation is governed by the following factors:  (i) We cannot go back on anything which we offered at the Berlin Conference.(ii) We cannot agree to the forcible neutralisation of Germany or to thewithdrawal of Allied troops in advance of the conclusion of a peace treaty.(iii) We cannot expect any concessions from the Russians unless we advance on our position at Berlin. What advance can we make? It issuggested that, subject to the views of our Allies and in particular tothose of Dr. Adenauer, the only possible advance would be to undertakethat the Federal Government would agree to some staging in theirrearmament programme. We should have to say that this could onlybe contemplated pending the decision of an all-German ConstituentAssembly formed as a result of free elections throughout Germany held under international supervision. While the Federal Government^plans were to this extent suspended, the East Zone administration would not be obliged to disband the Volkspolizei.For the rest the Western Powers would continue to urge their Berlin plan fora Germany reunited by stages following from free all-German elections, the resultant all-German Government being free to choose its own political affiliations.Some further concessions to the Soviet Union could be made as follows:  (a) The Western Powers would explicitly drop their insistence (e.g., in their note of-29th November) that there should only be a meeting when theSoviet Government had given evidence that there was &quot; a real prospectof finding solutions &quot;;(b) Subject to Dr. Adenauer&apos;s views, both West and East Germans couldparticipate in the discussions on Germany. If the Russians rejectedthese concessions, the Western position in Germany would be strengthened and the position of the Russians and the SocialistDemocratic Party correspondingly weakened.It is clear that none of these concessions could be offered without the assent ofthe Federal Government. This makes it essential that the Western germans should be associated with us at an early stage in the preparatory discussions. TheFrench will dislike this because their aim is to keep Germany as a second-classmember of the Western coalition. The United States will insist on german participation.We shall consequently have to walk warily. Perhaps the best formula wouldbe a tripartite working group, to which a German would subsequently be invited;followed by a meeting of four Ministers.C. European SecurityA constructive suggestion open to the Western Powers would seem to be theoffer of a declaration stating that they had ho intention of altering frontiers orusing force to alter them and giving the Soviet Union a guarantee of assistance,ifforce was used against her or her satellites. But although this raises the questionof deciding on the frontiers to be guaranteed and the form of the guarantee to begiven, the idea is worth pressing since many people on this side of the Curtainbelieve that Russia and her satellites have reason to fear a German revanche.
