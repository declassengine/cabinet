L11th March, 1955.ANNEX ATo the Secretary of State for the Colonies from Major-general sir H. Ranee (Trinidad)Personal No. 29 . 7th February, 1955.Princess Margaret has left us and there is no one who does not feel sad. Fromthe very start she captured the imagination and hearts of all Trinidad and Tobago.Her reception was to me astounding and every day the routes which she was tofollow were crowded. The behaviour of the people throughout has beenmagnificent and their remarks as the Princess passed gladdened me, and I am surethe Princess also. Remarks like &quot; She nice &quot; and &quot; She like a fairy &quot; were meteverywhere, and I do not believe that ever in the past has such enthusiasm been shown for any person or persons. The highlights of her visit were undoubtedlyher initial reception; the garden party followed by the carnival at government house; the State drive and civic reception; the children&apos;s rally; and visit to Tobago.Each of the Ministers here presided at some function which the Princess attendedand had the opportunity of speaking to her. The reply by the Princess to the address by the Port of Spain City Council was beautifully done and, everyone felt,was a sincere and personal response to her welcome.2. The Princess has been seen by hundreds of thousands and has met people in every walk of life. She asked to see Quevedo the Councillor, who is a calypsosinger, and when he said &quot; Madam, my people are unwashed and unshod &quot; shereplied, &quot;Those are my people too.&quot; She has been patience itself with the Press,and you will remember we extended an official invitation to Latin-Americanjournalists. They have all informed me personally that they have been mostimpressed, not only with the Princess, but with the arrangements made for theirown personal comfort. Two extra innovations were introduced at the request ofthe Princess at the last moment. Firstly, the main calypso singer came toGovernment House at very short notice and sang calypsos to the Princess and my47786 b
guests after dinner for about 45 minutes. Secondly, we left Trinidad half an hourearlier than scheduled on the original programme in order that the Princess should see from the air parts of southern Trinidad including the pitch lake.3. The visit to Tobago was a great success. The weather was perfect and aswe had a few minutes in hand before we touched down at the airport we flew over parts of the island which gave her some idea of the beauty of Tobago. Bothin the cocoa area in Trinidad and Tobago, immortelle trees were in full bloom,and from the air it was a magnificent sight. The Princess spent most of the timein the air in the cockpit where she was able to get an excellent view of the countryside.Her departure in the Royal Barge from Little Wharf, Scarborough, before embarking in the Royal Yacht, which was a few hundred yards from the shore,was a truly remarkable event. The crowd were in a frenzy of enthusiasm andbroke down all barriers so that we had the greatest difficulty in keeping them offthe Little Jetty, from which she descended into the Royal Barge.I feel sure that Her Royal Highness was deeply touched by the reception which she has received here from all sections of the people of Trinidad and Tobago, andwe all wish that at some future time she will be able to make a return visit over a longer period. The Princess has undoubtedly evoked or stimulated a loyalty and enthusiasm for the Crown which in these troubled days is of particular value.4. Further sidelights on the visit are that one paper reported, &quot; Never hasany one distinguished visitor so impressed her infectious personality on thisnormally hard-bitten and cynical Trinidad community.&quot; Another paper says,&quot; When an ordinary woman of the country declared that the Princess made prettyflowers look prettier she was voicing the feelings of the great majority.&quot;5. This visit has in some ways made up for the disappointment of the people in not seeing Her Majesty The Queen on her Commonwealth Tour, but it hasincreased their hopes and longings that Her Majesty could be persuaded to includethese islands in her next tour.6. Speaking personally, we have lost a most charming guest and one who made us feel at home from the moment of her arrival.ANNEX BBarbados. No. 84 Government House,Sir, 17 th February, 1955.During the visit of Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret I was asked by a member of the Household whether the work involved by a Royal visit was really justified. This prompts me to give you a few impressions of four memorabledays in Barbados, the 9th to the 12th February, 1955.2.\ I attach a copy of a hooklet* describing briefly the main events in theProgramme, which was carried out almost to the minute in perfect weather. I also attach a copy* without the hand-done maps, &amp;c., which were inserted in the princess&apos;s copy-of a booklet prepared by Mr. G. T. Barton, describing the partsof the Island which were visited.3. Our local Press had tended to be somewhat critical of the plans made,but their tune changed to one of enthusiasm once the Princess arrived and they saw the various ceremonies unfolding. Wherever possible the emphasis was onyouth though protocol would not, of course, permit the exclusion of the eldersfrom their places of honour.4.   I will now run briefly through the programme.Wednesday, 9th FebruaryMy wife and I, with the Commissioner of Police and my Aide-de-Camp, wenton board H.M. Yacht&quot; Britannia &quot; at 10- 30 a.m. on the 9th February. Yachts and fishing boats and powered craft, many of which had met the Royal Yacht offHoletown seven miles up the coast, were patrolling a lane between ship and shore.In the Careenage every possible and impossible vantage point, including the riggingof schooners, was manned. One motor vessel was leaning over at an alarming angleWith the weight of spectators. Several people fell into the water during the arrival
and departure ceremonies, but nobody seemed to mind and the Harbour Policefished them out. The crowds gave us what the Barbados Advocate called an&quot; encouraging &quot; cheer as we went by. We returned to the Chamberlain wharf at10 - 50 and at 11 - 00 the progress of the Royal Barge was signalled by ships&apos; sirensand cheers as the whole, huge crowd, estimated by The Daily Telegraph at 25,000,came alive. I conducted Her Royal Highness through a triumphal arch^ with SeaRangers and Rangers on either side, into Trafalgar Square, and there was a fanfareof trumpets. Looking round the Square Her Royal Highness could see, besides the Guard of Honour, members of the Ex-Officers&apos; Association, contingents ofGirl Guides and Church Girls&apos; Brigade and a vast throng of people.After a Royal Salute had been given, the Police Guard was inspected and verysmart it was. I then presented the persons listed in Annexure &quot; A,&quot;* before takingHer Royal Highness into the yard of the Public Buildings, which had beendecorated for the occasion. The Royal Cipher, done in marigolds on the lawn,caught the eye as we approached a contingent of the St. John Ambulance Brigade.The Churchwarden of St. Michael presented an illuminated address before we entered the Legislative Building. The President of the Legislative Council and the speaker of the House of Assembly, both of whom had been presented in the Square,received Her Royal Highness at the doors of their respective Chambers and presented the Members and their wives. Leaving the Parliament Buildings, HerRoyal Highness walked down a line of Ex-Servicemen and back into the Square,where a final Royal Salute was given before the Royal Party entered the waitingcars. A Canadian Press comment on the ceremony in Trafalgar Square was to theeffect that only Nelson (Barbados&apos;s Nelson on his pedestal) was silent and kept hisback turned to the Princess. It is quite beyond me to describe the wonderfulenthusiasm and orderliness of the people. I understand there were one or twominor scuffles early on near the edge of the Careenage, which has no protectingwall. These were promptly attended to by the Police and order had been fullyrestored by the time of Her Royal Highness&apos;s arrival. The report from RhonaChurchill published in the Daily Mail of the 10th February was grossly exaggeratedand most unfair to the Barbados Police who are second to none in these parts.We drove to Government House with the Police Mounted Escort. the princess sat on my right in the Governors Silver grey Sapphire car with herStandard over the windscreen and the Governors flag on the bonnet. The routeof a mile or more to Government House was packed with cheering and wavingpeople. The Barbados Regiment manned one section of the route: Police, Cadets,Scouts and Boys of the Church Lads&apos; Brigade were stationed along the remainder.At Government House Her Royal Highness inspected the Mounted Troop.5. At 4-30 p.m. we left Government House by car and found the crowdoutside the gates if anything bigger than it had been in the morning. It was thesame along all the City roads and of the twenty-four miles covered that afternoononly the occasional hundred yards Or so were clear of people. The Princess wasamused by some of the remarks heard as she drove by. &quot; Pretty for so! &quot; &quot; Howsweet! &quot; and &quot; Cheese!&quot; were among them. &quot; Cheese &quot; was interpreted by thedriver of the Government House car as meaning &quot; beautiful &quot; (the local equivalent of &quot;Honey&quot;). The Barbados Advocate reported: &quot; One small boy said that hewould bet anyone and win that the Princess was the prettiest woman in Barbadosand could win any beauty contest hands down without hardly trying.&quot;At Hastings House Sir Stephen Luke received Her Royal Highness and presented senior members of his staff and the Executive Secretary of the regional economic Committee, vide Annexure &quot; B,&quot;* before showing her the Library andConference Room.6. Another large and enthusiastic crowd, including about 2,500 schoolchildren, was assembled at Six Cross Roads. The Premier was there to receiveHer Royal Highness. After the persons listed in Annexure &quot; C &quot;* had been presented, Her Royal Highness planted a Pride of India (Peltophorum Vogelianum)tree in the grounds of the new Secondary Modern School: At Mr. Adams&apos;invitation, Her Royal Highness then named the School &quot;The Princess MargaretSchool&quot; and unveiled a plaque. After looking around the beautiful school halland talking to the Architect, Captain K. J. Tomlin, M.B.E., among others, HerRoyal Highness went over to speak to some of the children outside. Thephotographers, who were there in force, took full advantage of this deviation from* Not reproduced.47786 b 2
a set programme and got in each other&apos;s and everybody else&apos;s way in the process.&quot; Three Cheers &quot;were given and we drove home to Government House.7. That evening there was a State Dinner at Government House in honour ofHer Royal Highness. I attach a list of the guests as Annexure &quot; D.&quot;*Thursday, 10th February8. Thursday was originally intended to be a free day, but in order to cutdown the time of Friday&apos;s drive, it was arranged that Her Royal Highness woulddrive slowly through the City and up Highway 1 to Holetown, before spending theremainder of the day with Mr. and Mrs Ronald Tree at Heron Bay. Excitedcrowds thronged the City streets and I think only one stretch of about half a mileof country road was clear of waiting people. On this drive we passed through thegrounds of Queen&apos;s College and were nearly deafened by the cheers of the children from several schools who were mustered there. Her Royal Highness accepted abouquet from the girls of Queen&apos;s College. Earlier that morning Her royal highness had expressed a wish to meet the British Guiana and Barbados cricketteams, who were engaged in their second Test Match, and a surprise visit was paidto Kensington Oval on the way out of the City. Sir Allan Collymore, who isPresident of the Barbados Cricket Association, received Her Royal Highness and presented the teams after which &quot; Three Cheers &quot;were given.9. There were rumours of a large cash offer for a photograph of Her royal highness while bathing at Heron Bay. I hope and believe that any such attempt,if it was made at all, was unsuccessful. The overseas Press, so far as I know,observed a &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement &quot; to keep away.10. Her Royal Highness returned from Heron Bay to Bridgetown that eveningin the Royal Barge and later attended a private dinner party at Government House.Friday, 11th February11. On Friday morning we left Government House at 10-30 and drove fairlyquickly to Holetown as this part of the route had been covered slowly on theprevious day. People knew about this but were present in their thousands just thesame. From Holetown onwards we slowed down at selected points, including twocountry schools whose children, drawn up in neat rows, waved and cheereddelightedly as we passed. At Speightstown Health Centre Her Royal Highnesswas received by the Minister of Social Services, who presented the persons inAnnexure &quot; E.&quot;* Dr. M. A. Byer showed Her Royal Highness around the building and on the lawn behind it Her Royal Highness chatted with several groups ofpersons including a group of mothers with their babies.12. The continuation drive gave Her Royal Highness an opportunity to seesomething of the beautiful scenery in the North-East of the Island and gave thepeople of St. Andrew, few of whom would be able to come into Bridgetown, anopportunity to see the Princess, of which they took full advantage.13. When nearing Bridgetown we came across a small group of cameramenwith a crowd of villagers. We stopped, but the people were so excited that theysurged forward onto the car so that a baby nearly fell through the window inaddition to a prickly spray of bougainvillea. We extricated ourselves as bestwe could. I might mention in passing a propos some of the journalists&apos; demand to &quot; free the Princess,&quot; that it is not generally prudent in the West Indies to stopa Royal car during a drive if a crowd is present unless police arrangements havebeen made beforehand. This is essential in the people&apos;s own interest or somebodywill get hurt. When Princess Alice visited Grenada in 1950, we were stoppedunexpectedly by the local &quot; mayor &quot; with a bouquet in Grenville. A crowd surgedround and on to the car and we had great difficulty in getting away from theirloyal but overpowering attentions.14. , When we returned to Government House the Princess gave thephotographers an opportunity to take informal photographs in the garden. after their departure Her Royal Highness with my wife and the Household drdveincognito to Heron Bay for lunch and a bathe.15. At 5 p.m. Her Royal Highness visited the Industries and Trade Fair.Cheering crowds again lined the streets and QueenVPark was packed so tight withpeople that I was a little anxious. The Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries
(in the absence in England of the Minister of Trade, Industry and Labour) receivedHer Royal Highness and presented the persons listed in Annexure &quot;F.&quot;*Mr. A. R. Toppin, President of the Fair Committee, conducted Her Royal Highnessround the Fair. From the point of view of the general public the tireless camera-men were a nuisance, but from our point of view they performed one usefulfunction by clearing a lane for us by stepping on the toes of the people behind them. (For the most part they seemed to go backwards or crabwise in front of us.) I do not think any Royal Princess could ever have mingled more closely withthe people than did Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret on this occasion.The behaviour of the people was splendid. Thrilled and delighted as they were,they were always polite and considerate. One frequently saw ordinary workingmen holding back the pressing crowd to make way for their Princess. The Fairitself was excellent of its kind and reflected the greatest credit on the organisersand on the commercial community. Besides many stall-keepers Her royal highness met, while going around the Fair, Mrs. Simmons, who recently receivedthe In Memoriam testimonial of the Royal Humane Society, and her small sonAnthony; Mr. Benjamin Forde, an aged veteran of the Ashanti war; and Mr. ElbertAlleyne, a craftsman, who made an inlaid cigarette box which was presented toHer Royal Highness by Mr. R. M. Cave, managing director of one of Bridgetown&apos;slargest stores, who was also presented. Her Royal Highness also saw the FicusBenjamina tree which was planted in Queen&apos;s Park by King George VI, when,as Prince Albert, he visited the Island in 1913 as a Cadet in H.M.S. Cumberland.16. After dinner that evening Her Royal Highness attended a Reception inthe grounds of Government House, to which 1,170 people had been invited. ThePolice Band played well, as usual, and the Choral Society, about seventy strong,sang four songs. During the evening the Premier presented Her Royal Highnesswith an Eighteenth Century Sangaree Bowl with cover as a small token of theaffection of the people of Barbados. The Princess also met a number of the guests.The proceedings were brought to a close by an excellent Tattoo put on by thePolice recruits who were civilians three months ago: and the Police Band.During the National Anthem at the end of the Tattoo, all the garden lights weredimmed and a spot light lit up the Princess standing on the balcony of government house. Several people who saw this from the grounds have since told me thatit was one of the most beautiful and moving sights they have ever seen.Saturday, 12th February17. In the morning at Government House Her Royal Highness met theBarbados Council of Women with representatives of its twenty-five memberorganisations and a few other social workers, vide Annexure &quot; G.&quot;*18. Just before lunch, to which guests were invited, Her Royal Highnessplanted a Yellow Flamboyant (Poinciana Regia) tree in the garden of government house. .19. Before leaving Government House for the last time to go to the Children&apos;sRally, Her Royal Highness said goodbye to the inside and outside staff of Govern-ment House and also spoke to Mrs. D. B. Irwin, wife of the Physician Specialist,who had been dangerously ill and had set her heart on seeing the Princess. with her Royal Highnesses approval arrangements had been made to bring Mrs. Irwinin an ambulance to Government House.20. The Police Mounted Troop escorted us on to the Garrison Savannah.It was a beautiful afternoon and the 12,900 school-children drawn up in orderlyformation and the huge crowd surrounding the Savannah made a noble picture.After the singing of the National Anthem and the acceptance by Her royal highness of a bouquet from the youngest first-class Brownie, the Premier presented the persons listed in Annexure &quot; H.&quot;* Her Royal Highness then drove for fifteenminutes through the lanes of cheering children. Not one broke ranks and thewhole Review reflected the greatest credit not only on the organisers but on the teachers and children who took part in it. Once the crowd of spectators brokethrough, but the breach was immediately closed by Boy Scouts. A contingent fromthe St. John Ambulance Brigade was on duty to deal with any casualties. these were surprisingly few and no child present missed the Review.After the Review the Police Mounted Troop put on a spectacular MusicalRide and the children sang two songs, one of which had been composed in honour
of Princess Margaret&apos;s visit. I attach a copy of the programme^ which contains the words of the songs that were sung.21. The Premier then made an appropriate speech and Her Royal Highnessmade a very charming reply. I enclose copies of both. After &quot;Three Cheers &quot;and a Royal Salute the Mounted Escort took us off the Savannah. A motor-cycleescort took over and we drove to Trafalgar Square. In spite of the large assembly on the Garrison Savannah, which has been estimated at 40,000 (none of whomcould attend the Departure Ceremony), and the dense crowds lining the route toTrafalgar Square, the crowds in the Square itself were even greater than on theday of arrival. But this time smiles were tinged with sadness because everyoneknew that in a few moments something almost beyond their understanding would go out of their lives.22. On arriving in Trafalgar Square Her Royal Highness met the Matronsof the General Hospital, the Mental Hospital and the Maternity Hospital, whowere present with a large number of nurses. A smart Guard of Honour wasmounted by the Barbados Regiment. In passing, I should like to record myindebtedness to the Commanding Officer of the Black Watch in British Guiana,who, in spite of his own shortage of officers, seconded Captain B. M. Hamiltonto this Government early last month to assist with the training of the Regiment.After the final Royal Salute Her Royal Highness said good-bye to the persons listed in Annexure &quot; A,&quot;* waved to the Members of the Legislative Council and the Houseof Assembly who were standing nearby, and passing through the triumphal archentered the Royal Barge. At this point the Honourable H. A. Cuke, C.B.E., called for &quot; Three Cheers &quot; for Her Royal Highness. This gave the signal for the crowdon the other side of the Square to burst through the Police cordon and in an instantthe Square was packed with thousands of well-behaved but excited people, anxiousto catch a last glimpse of the Princess.Meanwhile, the Police Band had made its way from the Garrison Savannahto. the Molehead where it played &quot; Auld Lang Syne &quot; and other tunes as theRoyal Barge headed out into the Bay.23. The Royal Yacht delayed her sailing until 6-30 p.m. when a fireworksdisplay coincided with her departure. The Yacht with its illuminations was abeautiful sight as she steamed out of the Bay. Copies of telegrams that wereexchanged after Her Royal Highness&apos;s departure are enclosed.24. Returning now to the question in paragraph 1 of this despatch the answer is an unqualified &quot; yes.&quot; When you add to the loyalty and devotion to The queen and the Royal Family, which are so strong in these Islands and especially inBarbados, that rare combination of beauty, charm and personality, whichThe Princess Margaret brought to us, you get something almost out of this world.The people were lifted right out of themselves and for four days one never saw aface without a smile save the occasional cameraman who had failed to get hispicture^To-day&apos;s Barbados Advocate contains the following letter which expressesrather charmingly what so many people felt:  To The Editor, The Advocate.Sir,It is seldom that angels condescend to visit us but one passed through ourtown on Friday, 11th February. They called her &quot; Princess Margaret&quot;.With thanks for space,I am,Yours truly,C. D. JORDAN.Church Street,Speightstown,St. Peter.The timing of Royal visits is, of course, most, important. They must never beallowed to become a matter of course. In this connection perhaps I may beallowed to suggest that when, in God&apos;s own time, British Guiana shows signs of getting out of the wood, a visit like this one might do more than anything else to turn the scales.
25. Finally, I should like to pay tribute to all those who contributed to thesuccess of the visit. Much hard work was done by many people and everybodymade his or her contribution. In this connexion I should like to record theexcellence of the decorations, floral and otherwise, and illuminations in Bridgetown.I should also like to record the debt owed by my wife and myself to those Ladieswho both provided and arranged all the flowers in Government House during the visit. These were all locally grown and were magnificent. I would single out forspecial mention Mr. Clive Smith, Commissioner of Police, Mr. G. T. Barton,Secretary of the Royal Visit Committee and Captain C. E. Raison, M.B.E.,A.R.C.M., Director of Music, Police Band.26. If you should see your way to submit this despatch, copies of which areenclosed, to the Palace and to Clarence House, along with my humble duty andthe grateful thanks of the Government and People of Barbados, I should bedeeply honoured.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your most obedient, humble servant,R. D. H. ARUNDELL,Governor.The Right HonourableAlan Lennox-Boyd, M.P.,Secretary of State for the Colonies.Speech made by the Premier, the Honourable G. H. Adams, c.m.g., q.c, m.c.p.at The Children&apos;s Rally, 12th February, 1955Your Royal Highness:A wave of great joy swept through these islands at the news that Your royal highness was to visit the British Caribbean. And the children from all parts ofBarbados have eagerly awaited this moment when Your Royal Highness would beamong them. To them this is a climax to a happy and memorable visit, now, all too soon, drawing to a close.In Barbados we are proud of our many links with Britain. The traditionswe cherish are of British origin and none do we cherish more than the long historyof loyalty to Your Royal House. The natural charm of Your Royal Highness has,however, brought the human and the personal touch that gives our loyalty newmeaning.Your Royal Highness has seen something of our countryside and something ofour activities in the fields of Health, Education and Commerce, but, above all, thisis the children&apos;s day, when they can show how happy they all are to have YourRoyal Highness with them. May I, on behalf of the children of Barbados,respectfully ask that Your Royal Highness will convey to Her Majesty The Queen,not only an expression of their devoted loyalty, but also an indication of the greathappinessthat the honour of a visit from Your Royal Highness has given them.You see before you, Mora, the future citizens of this Island; the boys and girlsin whose hands the destinies of Barbados will rest in days to come, and I am sure that, as they face the future, they will always remember the inspiration of this day with pride and with pleasure.Your Royal Highness it is for the children that I speak when I ask if YourRoyal Highness will be graciously pleased to address them.Speech made by Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret at theChildren&apos;s Rally, 12th February, 1955I thank you, Mr. Premier, for your kinds words this afternoon.To me, this is both a happy and, at the same time, a sad occasion.It is a happy one, because I am delighted to see here so many children gatheredtogether from all over this lovely island. 1 thank you wholeheartedly for yourwelcome, and for the charming song which you have just sung for me.But it is, for me, a sad day too, for this evening I have to sail away again from your golden friendly shores.From the time of my arrival, when I was greeted by your graceful yachts and fishing boats out at sea, and by your famous schooners in the Careenage, until now,
