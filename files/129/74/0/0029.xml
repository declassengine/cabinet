secret.(55) 7921st March. 1955ANZAM FLEET EXERCISEMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceMy colleagues will wish to know that plans are now being made,under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief, Far East Station, to stageoff the East coast of Malaya in the first half of June a Fleet exercise inwhich Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom forces will take part.The exercise will take the following form.(a) Concentration of forces near Singapore.(b) Combined fleets exercise off the east coast of Malaya (the exercise will be restricted to this area for political reasons) and practise forces in the sort of operations they are likely to carryout in war.(c) Dispersal of forces including visits of representative naval units to Bangkok,Saigon and possibly other South EastAsian ports.2. The value of the exercise will be greatly enhanced if it can beextended to include forces from the other Manila Treaty powers.    AtChiefs of Staff level, Australia and New Zealand have agreed that it would be highly desirable to invite these other powers to take part, and the commander in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet has said that he would like Americanships to participate.    The Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary agree with me that the exercise should be extended and steps are now being taken to obtain the approval of the Australian andNew Zealand Governments to this proposal.    When this has been obtained,invitations will be issued to the other Powers.3. I am sure my colleagues will agree that an exercise on thelines suggested will be a timely example of co-operation under the SouthEast Asia Collective Defence Treaty, and will help to strengthen the unity and cohesion of that alliance.H.M.jMinistry of Defence, S.W.1. &apos;COPY NO.CABINET21st March, 1955.
