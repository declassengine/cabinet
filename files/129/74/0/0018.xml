REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON TKB 1956 MEETINGOF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL, ASSEMBLY^general ^C c nside r at ionsA feeling has been expressed from time to time amongMember States that it is desirable for the United Nations General assembly to meet occasionally away from its permanent Headquarters in New York.This is felt to be particularly desirable in the year of a United StatesPresidential Election^ when the political atmosphere in the United states is highly chargedff and the Secretary-General has indicated that he wouldbe willing to suggest to Delegations that the Eleventh Session of the general assembly should be held in London in 1956 if suitable accommodation couldbe providedo    Since the question of holding the Assembly in London turnslargely on considerations of national prestige, it would be essential that both conference and hotel accommodation should be suitable both in quality and quantity0    If Delegations found themselves in what they con-side3red to be inferior, congested or inconvenient accommodation much ofthe prestige gain to this country would be lost.The Requirements2. To enable the General Assembly to meet in London in 1956,the following accommodation would be neededs-Plenary HallCapable of seating 2P500(600 delegates, 400advisers and 1,500 press and public)0sq.  to20,000Committee Rooms4 main committee roomsseating 450 each and 3others seating 60 each41,000LoungesOffices (including90,000 sqD ft. of office space forD ele gallons whichmay possibly be found at Embassies, etc.)2 Lounges 10,000This is a very large area, 326,000about the equivalent of the big Government office blockbounded by King Charles Street,Parliament Street,Great George Street, andStorey^ Gate.Total Areas 397,000In addition, hotel accommodation would be required for between threethousand and four thousand visitors, including delegates, advisers,secretariat, press,, etc,, for at least three months, and even  ongesr for those members of the Secretariat who would be responsible for makingpreparations for the Meeting,
The Alternatives30 Three schemes to provide the conference accommodationhave been examine ds-(a) To hold the Plenary Sessions at the Albert Hall and toprovide the other accommodation in existing buildions or on a site nearby0The Plenary Sessions could be accommodated in theAlbert Hall but office and other accommodation would be needed nearby0    In the physical senses there might besufficient accommodation at the Imperial College andadjoining buildings.    The site itself, however, isinconvenientj the fact that the Committee rooms would be physically separated from the Plenary meeting-place wouldprovide great practical difficulties, especially for the smallerDelegations; legislation might be necessary to deal withthe permanent seat holders in the Albert Hall; the plans forthe re-building of the Imperial College, recently approvedby the Cabinet, would be held up for at least a year;formidable difficulties would arise in moving the presentoccupants of the buildings involved, and until this had beendone it would be ixaposaibSs to put in hand the necessary adaptations 0(k)     To hire Earls Court or Olympia and adapt themEither building is big enough,, though extensive internalalterations would be needed..,    The buildings are even moreunsuitably sited than the Albert Hall0    Both Earls Court andOlympia area moreover, heavily booked for exhibitionsduring the period    There is no other home for these showsin London., and there are obvious objections to interferencev/ith important trade exhibitions-,    Substantial compensation would have to be paid to exhibitors and the rent would behigho\The total cost would be not less than S.Zj millions0(c)     To build on the South bank between County Hall andHvmgorford Railway Bridge,A provisional scheme has been planned which wouldgive ail the accommodation needed, including a hall for thePlenary Sessions,    The estimated cost to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be not less than  3 millions plus theexpense of putting in equipment for simultaneoustranslations^ telephones, filming etc0The use of the Festival Hall for the Plenary Sessionshas been considered, but there would be strong resistancefrom music lovers and the London County Council and thecost of rentj, compensation and alterations might be as muchas twice that of a temporary halloThe South Bank is in the heart of London and delegateswould have good and convenient accommodation,,    This schemeis, however,, the most vulnerable to criticism; the press and-2
the public might grumble at the erection in the heart ofLondon of an expensive building which would have to bepulled down a few months later,,    Shell will probably bebuilding a new office block next door in 1956 and someinconvenience might be caused by dust and noise0The site belongs to the London County Council and isat present laid out as a garden0    It would be advisable thatany negotiations should be preceded by an approach to theChairman of the London County Council by the foreign secretary,,Economic and Financial considerations , From the points of view of prestige and tourism the proposalto hold the United Nations General Assembly in London in 1956 would bewelcomes    From the balance of payments point of view, it is estimated that,after taking into account adverse factors such as the loss of other visitorsdue to the shortage of accommodation, there would be a net gain to theUnited Kingdom of the order of  2^- millions in foreign exchange, though this might be partly offset since it is expected that the United KingdomGovernment would be liable for up to  500,000 (mainly in dollars) of theadditional expenditure incurzjed by the United Nations Organisation in moving the Secretariat from New York to London0    The overall net gain tothe balance of payments is accordingly put at some  2 millions0    against this, the cost of building and subsequently removing temporary accommo-dation on the South Bank site would amount to between  3 and  jr. millions,,From the financial point o  view it is not reasonable to incur budgetaryexpenditure of this order to secure such, a relatively modest advantage toour balance of payments0Hotel Accommodation50 It would be necessary for members of the United NationsSecretariat to begin arriving in London in August and for Delegations to assemble by the third week in September.    Both August and September are extremely busy months for the London hotels, and during October a numberof big trade exhibitions, including the Radio Show and the Motor Show, takeplace s for which accommodation is normally fairly fully booked0    november and the first two weeks in December, on the other hand, would be easy, butby the middle of December the hotels begin to fill up again, and accommo-dation might again become difficult during the closing stages of -the SessionaIf the Session is to be held in London at all, it is essential that Delegationsshould be able to find suitable accommodation!  many of them have largeexpense allowances which they expect to be able to use and a great deal ofill-will might be caused if they found themselves in inferior or congestedaccommodation for the three months of the Session,,    In reply to confidentialenquiries, the Secretary-y of the British Hotels and Restaurants Associationindeed suggests that the hotel accommodation problem might turn out to beimpossible to solve.    Accommodation could, in any case, only be found atthe expense of other visitors,,TJ ne^Kblg60 If it were decided to invite the United Nations to hold the 1956Session of the General Assembly in London, the sketch plans and contractarrangements must be put in hand immediately0
7e It is hoped that the SecreiaryGeneral could obtain the viewsof Delegations informality by the end of April, and if these were favourableit would be necessary to let the preliminary contracts by the beginning ofJuly0    The final decision of the United Nations could not, however, betaken until the Tenth Session of the General Assembly which is due to begin in September 1955, and if this turned out to be unfavourable, amaximum of  500,000 would have been spent abortively.    If, moreover, it proved impossible to provide good hotel accommodation., or if the buildingtime-table were dislocated by politically-inspired labour troubles9 weshould lose rather than gain prestige.conclusions the committee conclude!&quot;(i)   that, provided satisfactory arrangements could bemade, there would be advantage from a prestigepoint of view in holding the 1956 General assembly in London!(ii)   that it might prove impossible to provide appropriatehotel accommodation;(iii)   that the best way to provide conference accommodation would be to erect temporary buildings on the South Bank at a cost of  3 -  3^- millions and that if theCabinet approve this proposal the Foreign secretary should be asked to make an immediate approach tothe Leader of the London County Councils(iv)   that if the Assembly came to London in 1956c there might be a net gain in foreign exchange of some 2 millions, but from the financial point of viewsuch a gain would not be commensux*ate with the budgetary cost involved?(v)   that i  the South Bank scheme is to be completed intime5 work on it must commence forthwith and animmediate decision is therefore necessary.    If theUnited Nations subsequently decided not to come toLondon, then there might be an abortive expenditureof about  500,000.
