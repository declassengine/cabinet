(55) 946th April, 1955Copy No.CABINETMALAYA: REVIEW OF THE situation memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies am circulating the accompanying report by General Bourne, Director of operations, to my colleagues because it seems to me to give an excellent picture of the present position in Malaya. General Bourne&apos;s general conclusions, withwhich the High Commissioner agrees, will be found at the end of his report andare reproduced in the Annex to this paper. It will be seen that the activities ofthe Communist terrorists are greatly reduced, but that progress against them is inevitably slow and that there is little prospect of extirpating them altogetherwithout a further marked change in the attitude of the public.2. The report mentions that operations are at present held up by a shortageof helicopters and the lack of a second parachute regiment. Both these requirements have been brought to the attention of the Chiefs of Staff. The British Joint ServicesMission has now been instructed to ask the United States Joint Chiefs of staff for 15 S. 55 helicopters now and 15 over the next two years, to be providedeither on loan or under End-Item aid. As regards parachutists, a squadron of volunteers from the Parachute Brigade has recently arrived in Malaya to join the security forces; and I understand that the War Office are prepared to considerthe possibility of sending a regular battalion of the Parachute Regiment to Malayain the autumn. In Malaya itself it is proposed to raise an experimental SpecialAir Service company from the Malay Regiment. These measures should do muchto meet General Bourne&apos;s needs.A. L-B.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,5th April, 1955.ANNEXGENERAL  CONCLUSIONS  BY  THE  DIRECTOR  OF  OPERATIONS,MALAYA, ON THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AT THE END OF 1954The present level of the emergency is such that the life of the country proceedswithout significant interference. The murder rate is steady at quite a low level(7 per month for the last 6 months) and is dispersed in such a way that there isno great impact on any one district or any particular race. Most of the incidentsare not of a serious kind and those of an aggressive nature are barely one a week.Johore and Perak account for the great majority of the incidents. The only other states which are really affected by the emergency are Pahang, Negri Sembilan and,to a lesser extent, Selangor and Kedah. The remainder can almost be said to be free from the effects of the emergency.2.   There is little overall direction from the politburo of the MalayanCommunist Party (M.C.P.).  The morale of the terrorists (who still number over4,000) is low and it is likely that it will remain so as long as there is little hope of47886
external intervention and as we continue the pressure which deprives them ofsupplies, in particular food and arms. Their steady casualty rate of 50 to 60 amonth also undoubtedly affects their spirit. However, the only move which might make the hard core terrorists give up the struggle would be direct pressure fromPeking. Meanwhile undoubtedly their aim is to remain in being prepared againstthe time when outside assistance, or outbreaks of communal strife resulting uponthe withdrawal of the British, will enable them to come out into the open and takeover the country. The M.C.P. leaders are beginning to realise that the prospectof outside assistance is remote; repeated authoritative statements should help to convince them that the British will not withdraw until the Communists have been finally beaten.3. The existing strength of the security forces is sufficient to hold theemergency at the present level. Indeed, some slight but progressive improvementmay be expected unless the M.C.P. changes its policy. It is unfortunate, however,that our operations to disrupt the three main deep jungle bases are slowed downby the lack of a second SAS regiment. The addition of a company of theParachute Regiment in March 1955 will be extremely welcome, but five or sixsquadrons of SAS type continuously on operations are required to achieve ouraims in the deep jungle.4. Two SAS regiments, together with 20 efficient medium helicopters (givingthe daily availability of 10 already requested), would offer good military prospects of speeding up the shooting side of the emergency in 1955.5. Really significant progress in the emergency as a whole will only be made if we gain the whole-hearted support of the people. They will not give this supportunless the following three fears are removed:  (a) For the villagers, fear of local terrorist domination.(b) For the better educated and better off classes, fear of external aggression.(c) For many, fear of British withdrawal and of the possible resulting internalstrife.6. Only the removal of these three fears will get the Malayan peoples(particularly the Chinese) off the fence, which is the crux of the problem. none of them will be removed by the present military force at our disposal. The security forces have for 6 years been striving to remove the first but it is now clear thatthis, in addition to the other two, is largely a political as well as a military matter.A great deal depends on whether the Chinese and other leaders seize theopportunity now before them to persuade the Chinese villagers to stop supplying the Communists. The second fear can be considerably lessened if South-east asia Treaty Organisation is made a practical reality. The third calls for repeatedassurances that we shall not leave Malaya until the M.C.P. has been crushed.7. Even after the emergency is over it will be essential, if internal strifeis to be avoided, to continue to affirm that we shall still not withdraw until a truepartnership of communities has been established in Malaya.

DEF.Y.40/19. SECRET.REVIEW OF THE EMERGENCY&quot; SITUATION IH.MALAYABY,, THE DIRECTOR. OF .0P^TI0NS,v MALAYA.Ill Tj^ODrjCTIOil.1. Those in close contact with the Emergency in Ma.la.yatake the broad background for granted, hut for a properunderstanding of the problems confronting the security forces the following simple basic factors, which force the conduct ofthe Emergency into a certain pattern, have to be appreciated.2. There are at large in Malaya today rather more than,000 Communist terrorists.     They live in the jungle, which covers a large part of the country, and they have thereforevast areas in which to hide.     To look for them on the. groundis like hunting for a needle in a haystack.     Air reconnaissancecan seldom detect them.       They are therefore able to emerge from the jungle regularly, at points of their own choosing, tocreate an incident or to collect supplies, when they think theycan do so without great risk*3. At the present time the major incidents take the form ofambushes of the security forces, murder of selected civilians,attacks on isolated Police posts, removal of arms from the home guard, occasional shots at vehicles on the roads and theburning of lorries.4. The population of Malaya is around 6 million, consistingof 2-9 million Malaysians, 2*2 million Chinese, 0.7 millionIndians and 0-1 million others.     The terrorists are 90/Chinese, but their rebellion is in no way a national movement.They are feared and disliked by the mass of the people -7 butregrettably they ere helped by a minority.This is the only help they get, nothing but a smalltrickle of arms from Siam reaches them from outside the countryand, but for the internal help,,  the Emergency could be ended ina year.     Unfortunately, however, there is at present.no sign,that this internal help is diminishing in volume.5. The Emergency is a civil Emergency, with the armed forces in aid of the civil power.     The Director of Operations istherefore unable to discharge his functions through a straight-forward channel of command of the military type.    In order to preserve the constitutional position (in addition to the centralFederal government, every State and Settlement has its own government) it is necessary to direct the operations through aseries of State, Settlement and District Vfcr ExecutiveCommittees.     The system is cumbersome, but it is inescapableand it works.NOTE. Throughout this review the term Malaya should be read to mean the Federation of Malaya, which embraces the whole ofthe mainland but does not include the colony of Singapore.
6. An important factor in the background to the Emergencyis the fact that the Communists have succeeded in imposing an almost intolerable strain on the financial position of malaya and a severe load on the U.K. Treasury.   It absorbs   one-thirdof Malaya&apos;&apos;s total revenue and costs the U.K.  55M a year.Malaya depends, of course, upon two main products -rubber and tin.     With the high price of these commodities which existed in the earlier yeprs of the Emergency, funds wereplentiful.     The heavy fall in their price since 1952 hasradically altered the situation.    The civil budget for 1955 isalmost balanced, but Emergency expenditure amounting to some 16M will mainly have to be paid for out of reserves end these will be reduced to  9M by the end of the year.     In consequencethere is a pressing need to curtail Emergency expenditure.     Noessential project is on that account allowed to go by the board,but the need for economy is always present.A.M.7. The Director of Operations&quot; aim is to bring theCommunist armed rebellion, known as the Emergency, to an end.The purpose of this paper is to review the present state of theEmergency and to consider the extent to which this aim is being achieved.PROGRESS, OF THE . EMERGENCY.8. At Appendix &quot;A&quot; are detailed statistics which show how the Emergency has developed from its start to the present time.The following few figures selected from the appendix show at aglance how the Emergency has been suppressed since the \-iovstyear (1951):-		Monthly		eg.	195.1	1952	1953	1954Terrorist inspired incidents	507	310	97	89Civilians killed	44	29	7	8Security forces killed	42	22	8	7Terrorists eliminated	116	125	112	77Rubber trees slashed	94,293	37,622	311	1489. It is worth mentioning here that the monthly average ofterrorist inspired incidents has dropped to 74 during the last4 months of 1954, which is noticeably lower than it was duringthe first 8 months.
10, the figures below of fatal casualties caused by normalaccidents during 1954 are in some degree a yardstick against which the impact of the emergency on the day to day life of thepeople can be judged, althougb^of course they in no v/ay reflect the element of fear which the  emergency introduces into the lives of so manyt-mo nthiv^ay er ajses.in,t954,persons killed in road accidents. 35persons killed in other accidents, 87murders (i..on-i emergency) , 14miit3 areas *11, as the situation gradually improves it is possible to declare certain parts of the country &quot;white&quot; - a policy whichwas started in 1953.     in these &quot;white&quot; areas there are notroops, the police and home guard are reduced and there is a relaxation of emergency restrictions.     the &quot;white&quot; areas sofar declared contain 2 million people out of the 5 million inthe country and they have been virtually free of terroristincidents since they were created.     nine of these areascontaining 750,000 people have been declared since 1st july,1954DIGGING. FOR VICTORS.12. in explaining the aims and intentions of the terrorists,it is necessary to refer to a directive issued in 1951 by thepolitbureau of the malayan communist party.     this directivelaid down that the bulk of the terrorists should be withdrawn to the jungle and carry on with intensive cultivation, with theobject of making them self-supporting as far as possible.in food and to relieve the burden on their supporters in the villages.     simultaneously three major base areas were to beestablished in the deep jungle, where terrorists could restand retrain, while a &quot;united front&quot; against imperialism was tobe built-up covertly amongst the population of malaya.     oneof these base areas lies astride the frontier between malaya and siam, with the most important part of the area north ofthe frontier.13. this policy put an end to indiscriminate terrorismagainst the people and resulted in a low priority being given tofighting as opposed to digging.    the disadvantage of the policyfrom the communist point of view was that only in rice and rootcrops could they ever achieve any success.   furthermore, itdeprived them of the simple targets which they were accustomed to&quot; deal with and made it&apos;necessary to take on the toughersecurity forces if they were to be offensive at all.
The inevitable result was that they became soft andtheir morale deteriorated.,    An additional setback soon became apparent to them in the attitude of the public who, encouraged by the growing safety provided by security force success and communist inactivity, took heart, increased their resistanceand reduced their assistance in the form of supplies andfinancial contributions.     The security forces were able intheir turn to improve their intelligence, to eliminate manyterrorists, to recover numerous arms and ammunition, and to damage the terrorist organisations to a considerable degreeTOTGHER POLICY.14. &quot;When this was realised, starting in 1953 and continuingin 1954, e. tougher policy was ordered in order to raise the terrorists&apos;  own morale and to re-establish their domination ofthe public, improve their food supplies end increase theirfinances.     They were ordered to attack security forces, to gain more weapons, to attack targets such as small and isolatedpolice posts and    to take a more drastic line with uncooperativemembers of the public, including the elimination of suspectagents and the selective murder of other citizens as a warning.15. The result of these new directives, which take as muchas 18 months to become effective, is now apparent and the pattern of recent incidents is that the terrorists have carriedout a series of attacks against Police and Home Guard posts and against movement on the roads at an increased rate.     Aggressiveincidents of this nature average nowadays rather less than one a week.We are prepared, for and must expect more of theseincidents, indeed the terrorists have a far greater capacity for creating trouble then they exploit.   During the year they have lost three weapons for every one gained, but they are notcritically short of arms and ammunition, although they have nosurplus.     They got recruits from amongst the public apparentlywhen they wish, but recruiting is not at present replacingtheir losses, although we have recently established a definiterelationship between a successful seizure of arms by them 3.ndrecruiting in the tiis criccHowever, there is evidence in some areas to show thattheir morale is not high, that, they are short of supplies andthat our food denial is still the most effective weapon whichwe employ against them,.    whilst the security forces on theground are responsible for practically all the casualtiesinflicted on the terrorists our air attacks are increasing andare contributing to the reduction in terrorist morale.   Mortarand artillery fire also harass them and have a satisfactoryeffect on the waverers.IS. The map at Appendix 11B&quot;  shows the distribution of the terrorists throughout the country.COVERT ACTIVITIES.17. In connection with the effort to create a &quot;united front&quot;,the 1951 directive laid great emphasis upon the building up ofsubversive organisations among the civilian population, with
special attention to indoctrination of the youth of the country.The Communists1   so-called &quot;little devils&quot; organisation, active in many Chinese schools,  is a useful means of indoctrinationat the most receptive age and supplies information and recruitsto the terrorists.In the rural areas, a new and more secret organisationamongst the adult members of village communities has beendetected in several States.     It is at present concerned solelywith indoctrination; probably it is designed in the long term to penetrate the lowest strata of civic organisations and to influence lawful political parties at village level.Amongst the more sophisticated populations of the townsthe Malayan Communist Party is succeeding in building up. cellsof Party members amongst school masters and older pupils.   Intheir turn, these Party cells penetrate and create comparativelyinnocent associations of pupils and old boys which are to beused as &quot;front&quot; organisations.    Their activities will be steeredby the Party largely to support popular agitation against government measures.CJ3HCLUSI.0tT.18. Although there has been no great change in 1954 in theterrorists1  strength and policy, there can be no doubt that thereal hard core of the Communists intend to remain a force in being.     It is unlikely that they will put themselves in aposition so that we can easily eliminate them.It may be, in due course, that pressure from Pekingwill stop the shooting war (though some opinion questionswhether such orders if given would be obeyed by the real hardcore leaders), but there is no indication at present that suchan event is at all likely.   It may therefore be expected thatMalayan Communist Party efforts in 1955 will be concentrated on maintaining and possibly increasing their active strength,while building up &amp; more effective subversive organisation to penetrate villages,  schools and perhaps Government departments.The subversive organisations are likely to take full advantageof any unsettled conditions which may arise in connection withthe Federal elections.    They will attempt to create and encourage any type of popular opposition and discontent thatwill help to build up a general anti-British atmosphere and a civil security situation that might divert us from our principal task of attacking the Communists in the jungle.Propaganda will probably concentrate on their presentline that the British will shortly be leaving and that the eraof Communist control is rapidly approaching, when those whohave been foolhardy enough to oppose the terrorists or tosupport the present Government will be suitably dealt with.0PEPtATIONAL, POLICY.THE STEADY.SQUEEZE.19.The Briggs-Tenpler &quot;steady squeeze&quot; plan carried out
over the last four years has resulted in a reduction of the monthly incident rate from about 500 to less than 100 and has reduced interference with the commercial and civic life of thecommunity to tolerable proportions.    The basis of this plan isto maintain an overall framework of security forces and to denyfood to the terrorists, periodically mounting major food denialoperations in the bad areas.     As the terrorists become morehungry they are compelled to take risks in search of food andin the end are eliminated one way or another.However, through experience the terrorists have to someextent learnt how to weather these operations, re-establishingtheir hold on the area once local security force pressure isrelaxed.    when it is realised that the rice required to feedthe whole terrorist strength in Malaya constitutes only 0*lj5of the total consumption in the country, it is hardly surprising that no matter how rigorously food control is applied thedetermined terrorist can find ways and means to survive,particularly in the more thickly populated areas, where sources of supply are numerous.FUTURE TACTICS.20, During 1954 it has become apparent that an overallstalemate in the Emergency has practically been reached-   At thesame time events in Indo-China and in local politics are making it increasingly important that moans should be found to end theEmergency more quickly.   Without a large reinforcement of troops(and in the absence of a change in the attitude of the Chinesein Malaya) it is clear that food denial alone cannot achievesuch decisive results and- a more offensive policy is necessaryto dominate jungle areas important to the enemy, while maintaining the framework grip, particularly as regards food control.In 1954 it also became apparent that a change in ourtactics was desirable, for two reasons.     The first was that,in spite of laborious and lengthy preparations, our security forces were not killing any more terrorists after the fourthmonth . of a major food denial operation than were being killed in normal framework operations.    The second was that nowhere in malaya, except where the SAS had entered and remained in one   ofthe terrorists1  deep jungle bases, had we so far succeeded in forcing the Communists off their own chosen ground.    The semelocal notorious leaders were still supported by their ownspecial gangs and were still murdering civilians and attacking the security forces on the same piece of ground as they hadfrequented since 1948.     These two &quot;discoveries&quot; led to a changein our tactics.21. Experience has shown that short term jangle operationsemploying large forces are rarely successful and do notpermanently move the terrorists off their own ground.   more effective results are achieved by stationing a small force inone area for long periods,  so that it can gain and apply a thorough knowledge of the terrain and the local terroristorganisation and methods.    It has therefore been decided that,where information warrants it, troops will be based in anddominate areas of jungle important&apos; to the terrorists untilthe local Communist organisation has been completely disruptedand its members either driven from the area or eliminated.-
In order to put this policy into effect, operationalresponsibility in the quieter areas is being placed more andmore upon the Police and H..me Gua.rd, while the Array is being used to operate offensively in those jungle areas where thegreatest inconvenience can be caused to the terrorists.   Sincefood control remains a basic essential in any type of operation,some major food denial operations   will still be required in areas unsuitod to domination tactics.In conjunction with these domination and f .od denialoperations, action will also be taken to destroy thoseindependent platoons which are most aggressive.     Six of thesenlatoons have been chosen as special targets during the first half of 1955. \THE SIAMESE FROIITIER .22. For s^me years there has been an agreement with Siamthat both the Malayan and the Siamese Police may operate acrossthe northern frontier of Malaya for a distance varying between10 ant, SO Miles.   Wc make use of this agreement whenevernecessary and during 1954 there have been a number of small scale operations by the Police Field Force against the terroristsaero:, s the frontier.A joint intelligence centre has been set up in Songlchlain conjunction with the Siamese and this, combined with Policeprobing operations, should lead to a steady improvene nt in our knowledge of the terrorist organisation in the frontier.area.There appear to be about 400 terrorists in the area and verylittle pressure has been exerted against them by the SiamesePolice.   A frontier planning staff has been established to watch the operational picture.There has been an exchange of visits between theDirector of Operations and the head of the Siamese Police, whoagreed that our helicopters and our supply dropping and reconnaissance aircraft may operate over the frontier in supportof Police operations.    V/o are therefore in a position to mounta joint operation across the frontier with the Siamese if theneed arises.4^PRIGINES.i23. The process of controlling the deep jungle requires a major effort to win over the aborigines who&apos;live there.     Thereare believed to be 50 - 60,000 of these people in Malaya and about half of them (those that live in the juigle) have at onetime or another been under Communist influence.   Energeticmeasures to bring them all gradually under the wing of theGovernment were launched more than a year ago.     In the mainthese measures involve a major increase in the staff of the malayan department of aborigines and the establishment in the deep jungle of a chain of forts manned by the. Police.Good progress has been made and in terrorist areasthere remain now only some 3,500 r-borigines who have not yetbeen brought under control.     In the areas where the aborigineshave been won over they are being used to assist us actively and properly handled, are able to help us to make life in the deepjungle extremely uncomfortable for the terrorists. /8.
24.The main features of our operations in 1955 will be:-(a) Continued framework operations in the areas notyet declared white, with food denial still themain weapon.(b) Progressive handover to the Police and Home Guardof responsibility for Emergency operations in thequieter areas of the country.(c) Company &quot;domination&quot; operations by the army injungle areas which are important to the terrorists.Z.t the same tine, pursuit and progressiveelimination of the six most aggressive of the terrorists&apos; independent platoons.(d) Continuing efforts to win over the 3,500 aborigineswho are still dominated by and workingterrorists.for theOPERATIONS.THE ROYAL NAVY.25. The main contribution of the Royal Navy this year has again been the American S 55 medium helicopters of 848 naval air Squadron, which have been responsible for the major part ofthe trooplifting effort. . The helicopteris discussed below in the section on theis sufficient to say here that s renunstto the Chiefs of Staff for 848 Naval AirMalaya beyond April 1955.situation as a wholeRoyal Air Force and ithas already been ma.deSnuadron to remain inIn addition the Royal Navy has during the year carriedout 8 coastal bombardments and flown a few ground attack sortiesia support of ground forces, and has constantly patrolled the .coast in conjunction with vessels of the Royal Mc-Jayan Navy andthe Police.CONCLUSION.26. The opportunities for vessels of the Royal Navy toparticipate in the operations are limited, but those whichpresent themselves are rapidly exploited.   The.naval mediumhelicopters continue to be invaluable.THE ARMY.OPERATIONS.27.      , Throughout the year the whole force of twenty-two
TJZkbattalions and supporting arms has bee.n fully extended incombating the Emergency.     Owing to retraining only eighteenor nineteen battalions are available for operations at any onetime.28. Present terrorist policy of avoiding contact with thesecurity forces except under conditions of their own choosing,combined with the natural difficulties of the terrain,completely preclude any but slow and painstaking methods inwhich superior strength and fire-power can rarely be used toadvantage.     As a result during 1954, the average time a soldier has spent on patrol or in ambush before seeing a contactmade has been 1,000 hours and 300 hours respectively.     the overall ratio of kills to contacts has, however, risen slightlyduring the year ant when it is realised that the majority of theremaining terrorists have been in the jungle since 1948 and aretherefore skilled fighters, this trend may be regarded as satisfactory, although much further improvement cannot beexpected - indeed in the later months of the year there hasbeen a falling off.29.        In this connection it is interesting to compare thesuccess of the various ra.cial groups comprising the infantry in malaya.     The average number of terrorists killed per contactis as follows1953 1954*Fiji and East African battalions	1-03	1*20Gurkha battalions	1.00	1.02Malay battalions	0-C2	0*76British battalions	0*55	0?65Average for all battalions	0-82	0*88In comparing these figures it must be appreciated thatjunior leadership and experience are the keys to success in this form of warfare and in this respect the Fi:i, East African andGurkha battalions have had a big advantage over the British andMalays.During the course of the Emergency the Malay Regimenthas expanded from a force of two battalions to seven battalionsas well as finding NCOs for a battalion of the FederationRegiment, an armoured car squadron, a signal squadron and an expanded depot and training organisation.   The enormous dilutionand rapid promotion of the IJCO cadre of the Malay Regiment hasinevitably resulted in a severe lowering of the standard of junior leadership and experience.The British battalion has to fight while competing withthe twin disadvantages of the shortage of experienced regularNCOs common in all British units and the continuous turn overcaused by the national service system.     As a result the Britishpatrol is often led by a national service KC0 with IS monthsservice and composed of men who have been in Malaya or in theArmy for no more than 2 years, whereas the corresponding Gurkhapatrol will be led by an IICO with 10 years service and his men .have been fighting in Malaya for an average of 4 - 5 years. /10.
30. The increasing difficulty in establishing contact:  withthe terrorists is shown by the drop in the average nuraber ofeliminations achieved by battalions of each group in 1953compared with 1954s-	1955	1954Fiji and East African battalions	50-5	42 &quot;0Gurkha battalions	52-7	28*british battalions	22-8	16*0Malay battalions	15*7	14-5Average for all battalions	28*4	21*8It is clearly becoming inereasingly difficult to find and killterrorists.31. There is a continuing need for more parachute units ofthe regular volunteer SAS type for operations in deep -jungle.It has been clearly shown that British troops are the most successful in deep jungle where contact with and winning over of the aboriginal population is an important component ofsuccess.     Because these operations ere protracted and takeplace in remote jungle areas it is not possible to employ unitswith national service personnel whose continuous turn-overmakes the administrative problem insuperable.    22 SAS Regiment .is the only British regular unit which can readily be kept on operations for long periods in deep jungle.    It lies however only three squadrons and is not able to cover all the tasks required of it.   A second regiment is needed, but the &quot;War Office has been unable to provide one, although they propose to send a company of the Parachute Regiment in March 1955.     As a long termproject steps are being taken to convert two Malay infantrycompanies into parachute companies, while the formation of anindependent Gurkha parachute company is under consideration.32. The effect of artillery and 4*2 inch mortars inharassing the enemy in the jungle camps has been fullydemonstrated during the year.    There is a need for medium artillery, with its longer range and heavier shell.33. The engineer effort has been concentrated onconstruction of airstrips and roads. &apos; While the availability ofengineer units will be doubled in 1955, efficiency and output is likely to be seriously curtailed by the unserviceability ofR.E. plant, most of which comes from wartime stocks.     Thisplant has outlived its useful life and the constant repair ofit imposes a severe strain on the limited R.E.M.E. resources in Malaya.34. The increasing use of the Array in jangle areas hithertodominated by the terrorists requires thoroughly efficientsignal communications over long distances under difficult conditions.    It is hoped that the introduction of theAustralian A.510 set, 400 of which are expected by April 1955,will meet this need./ll
35. The existing Ar&apos;&quot;,y order of battle is sufficient tocontinue the present rate of success in the Emergency.   any reduction would almost certainly lead to a deterioration of thesituation.     For more effective military action additionalregular British troops are required to enable protractedoperations to be undertaken simultaneously against the threedeep jungle base areas.    The most welcome reinforcement wouldbe a second regiment of SAS, if neoessory in exchange for aBritish battalion.The Emergency reveals the grave disadvantages of thepresent fortnightly call up system which results in a continualchangeover of personnel during operations and which affects theefficiency of British units.THE ROYAL AIR. FORCE.AIR ,SUPPLY.36. The whole pattern of anti-terrorist operations in the jungle is dependent upon the ability of the RAF to drop supplies to troops in the jungle.   Air supply continues therefore to bethe most important role of the RAF in the Emergency.    Theaverage monthly air supply during the year was approximately300 t. as and there will probably be an increase in 1955 to double this amount.,    The RAF is able to meet this commitment,and that of parachuting troops when required, provided thetransport Vcl: tta force based in Singapore is maintained at itspresent strength.HELICOPTER OPERATIONS.57. The importance of the helicopter to operations in Malayais immense.   Throughout the year the helicopter has demonstratedits versatility and has been used extensively in its variousroles of casualty evacuation, trooplifting, reconnaissance,comuunications flying, and for search and rescue.     There hasalso been a little, but not enough, spraying of Com lunistcultivations.The available helicopter effort dwindled away during theyear until in October 1954 the force was hopelessly inadequate,but the Royal Navy S.55 helicopters became available again inuseful numbers early in December 1954.    Some of the new BristolSycamores began operations in mid-November 1954 when almostfor the first time during the year a number of light helicoptersbecame available every day.TROOPLIFTING.58. Trooplifting is the primary role of the mediumhelicopter and is vital in achieving the maximum effectiveness of the security forces against the terrorists in this difficult
jungle terrain.     8,471 troops (Army and Police) were liftedinto or out of the jungle by helicopter during the year, a monthly average of 700 men.     Future operational plans rely on a still greater use of the helicopters for trooplifting and requirements in 1955 are estimated as 6,000 troops (Army and police) per month.THE helicopters COPTEFt FORGE.39. Br-sed on past experience and estimates of future plans,representations were made by General Templer to the Chiefs ofStaff in February 1954 for an increase in the helicopter force.As a result the Chiefs of Staff decided to provide a force of twenty medium helicopters and seventeen light helicopters in malaya.    It is considered that this force of helicopters,together with a strength of ten Pioneer aircraft, v/ill meet our needs in 1955.    The process of building up the force to thisstrength has begun, but deliveries are slow and unfortunately the Ivestland VJhirlwind, the replacems nt for the S.55 helicopter,is unsatisfactory.     Recommendations to remedy this serious situation were submitted to the Chiefs of Staff in Director ofOperations1  paper DEF.Y.25/13/A dated 30th November 1954.PIONEER AIRCRAFT.40. There are now three Pioneer aircraft in Malaya, with afurther seven due in 1955.    They have proved of great value notonly for normal communications, but particularly because of thework taken over from the helicopters.     The main task of thePioneers is communication flying to the jungle forts, includingPolice garrison exchanges.     Their performance is unique, inthat no other fixed vying aircraft is known to exist which is capable of operating into .the special airstrips of 150 to250 yards in length which have been constructed by the royal engineers at nine jungle forts during the year.   More of theseairstrips are yet to be built.AIR OP/LIGHT LIAISON SQUADRON.41. The reconnaissance of the air 0.P./light liaison Austersquadron has continued to provide valuable information,particularly about the terrorist cultivation areas and. theirjungle camps.   Much of the information obtained by the ArmyAuster pilots continues to form the basis of some of the most successful security force operations.During 1954 highly successful day and night marking-techniques have been developed by the squadron, in conjunctionwith the air striking force, which has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the offensive air effort.    Consequently markinghas now become an important task of the air OP squadron.     Atotal of 23,250 hours were flown during the year on the 31Austers of the unit, an increase of 50?i over the previous year.AERIAL SPRAYING OF TERRORIST CULTIVATIONS.42. As a means of nullifying the terrorist policy of growingtheir own food in the jungle, equipment was developed in 1953
for spraying their cultivations from helicopters.     Severalsuccessful small scale operations were carried out, hut due to lack of helicopters these operations had to he discontinuedearly in 1954.     A start was made again recently.OFFENSIVE AIR ACTION.43. Throughout the year air strikes have been made by LincolnHornet and Vampire aircraft5 Sunderlands have also been usedoccasionally for prolonged harassing.   It is extremely difficultto find good air targets owing to lack of information, the limitations of visual and photographic reconnaissance in the jungle and the dfepe :-i iiatur - of the enemy in tiris guerillawarfare.     vhoncver possible, air strikes have been concentratedagainst pinpoint and comparatively small area targets.     as previously mentioned, the Auster marking technique has greatlyenhanced the effectiveness cf the offensive.air effort against&apos;pinpoint targets which can now be pattern bombed with a high degree of accuracy by day and, in favourable circumstances, also by night.     The expenditure of bombs, rockets and ammunitionwas 15/- greater than in 1953.   .-Since mid-November 195-&apos;.*: the Lincoln medium bomber&quot; force has been reduced to one and a half squadrons and early in 1955 theRAF Lincolns will be replaced by a flight of Canberras.The continued use of a bomber and ground attack force is essential, for the purpose of keeping the -terrorists on the move, disrupting -:hoir organisation and lowering their morale -by creating a genera&apos;.!  sense of insecurity.     Though it isimpossible to assess directly the effects of offensive airstrikes it is known that casualties and surrenders have resulted from them.     Air attacks represent one more form of pressure onthe terrorists and as such constitute an integral and important part of the security force operations in the Emergency.VOICE.. AIRCRAFT .44. The use of voice broadcasting aircraft is an important part of the psychological warfare campaign.     Three Dakotas andtwo Austers are used for this at present, but it is possiblethat more voice aircraft may bo required later to step-up the effort.     The Dakotas cannot be kept in service for long, soit is important that a suitable replacement aircraft be found.CONCLUSION.,45. The Royal .v.l:: Force plays a. very important part in theEmergency operations.    Provided the  helicopter force is brought up to the size and quality which he v. been promised, resources are adequate for the task0THE POLICE.HISTORICAL,46.        At the st.irt of the Emergency a rapid expansion /14.
711 pof the Regular Police be;.an and a special constabulary wasembodied.     By early 1953 the strength of the force had risen from 11,000 to 71,000 all ranks, of whom 42,000 were special constables.Expansion was halted in 1953 and consolidation began.It was found that the improvement in the Emergency situation would by then allow some&quot; reduction and in any event thefinancial condition of the country was demanding economies.     Itwas therefore decided to make substantial reductions and thestrength of the force has been cut by 20,000 men during the lasttwo years.     The Police Field Force (2,770 strong), whose taskis to man the jungle forts, patrol the Siamese frontier and assist in framework operations, were reorganised on more economical lines.In 1954 it became apparent that any jfur^head cuts; in thespecial constabulary and the Police lieutenants (who command theconstabulary in the field)  would be too. severe.     A decision wasconsequently taken to hold the constabulary at 23,500 and toincrease the number of Police lieutenants by 50.     Since thensteps have been taken to obtain yet a further 99 Police,lieutenants, to provide adequate leadership for the 1955 tacticalplan.These fluctuations in strength have been so rapid that ithas been difficult for the Po&quot;.ice to settle down. They have hadto face many awkward problems in trying to plan the best security for the public,  particularly during the reduction period whenthe public has not always been confident that the cuts   andredeployments that were in progress were fully justified.jENQJUSASED- Pt&amp;R^&apos;-,MILITARY TASKS OF THE POLICE,.47. The tactical plans for the latter part of 1954 and for1955 involve, as has already been explained, handing over to thePolice responsibility for Emergency operations in large parts ofthe country where the Emergency is no longer so severe.   Inorder to compete with this more extensive operational role, anumber of Police Special Squads led by Police lieutenants&apos; withAsian seconds-in.-comnend have been formed from the special constabulary and have already proved their worth.    This processwill continue and a further&quot; step is now being taken in theformation of small squads of Police aboriginal guards for offensive operations and scouting in the deep jungle.48. It is satisfactory to note that there has been a steadyimprovement in the Police ratio of kills to contacts.SPECIAL BRANCH (INTELLIGENCE).49. The Special Branch of the Police is the primaryintelligence agency of the security forces.    It has naturallytaken some time to build up the strength and. efficiency    -    &apos;&apos; -.;of   this . branch, but it is now producing information ofincreasing accuracy about the terrorists.    Besides dealing withterrorist and underground Communism, the Special Branch has to watch for extremist tendencies in the domestic political field and for local evidence of the aspirations of neighbouring countries which may seek to take advantage of the situation in
212 qMalaya.     Although penetration of the Malayan Communist Party at high level is difficult,  the Special Branch keeps well abreastof Malayan Communist Party policy, intentions and organisationat all levels.Some thirty military intelligence officers have beenintegrated v/ith the Special Branch.     Their task is. to assist in the collation and presentation of tactical intelligence for emergency operations.   Their work is valuable and is appreciatedby the Police.50. The Police play a major part in the Emergency.&apos;    With the progressive transfer to them of responsibility for the quieterareas from which the Army is being withdrawn, their task is growing.    Whilst the recent reduction in the size of the force was decided upon for good reasons, a period of stability is now very necessary and no further reductions will be made during 1955.An improvement has been achieved in the intelligence provided by special Branch, whose strength also cannot be reduced at present.THE HOME GUARD.OPERATIONS.51. During the year the. Home Guard, with an average strengthof 172,500, has consolidated its position throughout the countryand is taking an increasingly active part both in local defence and in assisting other security forces in prosecuting theEmergency.The bearing, efficiency, enthusiasm and confidence ofstatic units has shown marked improvement resulting from&apos;a driveon musketry, greatly helped by the introduction of travellingtraining teams.&apos;   Steady progress has also been made in trainingunpaid village leaders to take a fuller responsibility for thetraining end administration of their units.   However, this responsibility still falls largely on the paid European permanent staff, which makes any large scale reduction in their numbers atpresent inadvisable? in fact, the rundown planned a year ago hasbeen slowed down.52. The Home Guard contains both Malay/Aboriginal members and Chinese members.     The organisation of the force makes nodistinction between these two elements, but in assessing the operational performance of the Home Guard it is desirable toconsider them separately.53. The Malay/Aboriginal Home Guards about 100,000 strong are disposed in and defend some 2,200 kampongs.    In 1954 they havebeen responsible for 34 terrorist eliminations, as compared with48 in 1955.     23 weapons out of some (38 , 000 held were lost bothe terrorists during the year through surprise action and 31were recovered from them.
211a.In general, it may be said that the Malay/Aboriginalelement of the Home Guard is a reliable force, steadfast andpatient, end that its initiative is increasing as added scopeis given to its offensive potential.54. The Chinese element of the Home Guard v/as formed some two years ago, when 50,000 Chinese were compulsorily enrolledinto some 500 new village units.     They were mostly apatheticand. in many cases unwilling.     The experiment was full of potential &quot;dangers.During 1954, however, 150 new village units (say25 - 30,000 Chinese) passed into the phase of full responsibilityfor defence and in the&apos;case of those villages there has been nosuccessful terrorist attack and no loss of arms to the terrorists.Furthermore, a certain spirit is now discernible.     In the courseof the year the Chinese Home Guard has been responsible for 21terrorist eliminations.   Among the remaining 150 units, integratedin defence with the Police, there have been three incidents inwhich treachery was apparent.   From a holding of some 10,000 guns44 have been&apos;lost to the terrorists and of these 30 under conditions suggestive of treachery.    13 guns have b-en recovered.Unfortunately some of the Chinese Home Guards (notably inJohore) have from the start been under heavy Co:nrumist influence and cannot be relied upon.     They have, however, not beendisbanded, since such action on our part might encouragedeliberat:. inefficiency in other Chinese Home Guard units.In general, however, it may be said that satisfactory progress has been made during 1954 in the development of adelicate experiment, but that there remains the problem of aresidual hard core (not likely to be large) of stronglypenetrated Chinese Home Guards.55. There are now four hundred mobile operational sectionsactive throughout Malaya.   They have been an unqualifiedsuccess.     The progressive withdrawal of military units fromthe quieter areas makes their efficiency a matter of increasing,importance and in some districts they have already b een given&apos;their.own areas of operational responsibility, which.they aresuccessfully denying to the terrorists.&apos;56. Quite apart from its operational value , the Home Guardhas been instrumental in raising the morale of the population in most areas and in introducing a community spirit in places where none existed before.   The Government is now consideringthe long-term future of the Home Guard, with a view to maintaining this spirit should the tempo of the Emergencydecline.In &quot;white&quot; areas, where little terrorist   threat exists,economies will be made by placing units on reserve, retainingon the active list only a small armed nucleus responsible for preventing any recrudescence of terrorist activity in their area.C0HCLUSI0H.57.^       The Home Guard continues to play an important partagainst the terrorists, but a slight reduction&quot; in strength to160,000 will be possible in .1955.A7.
P 3 YCH0L0 psychological  WARFARE.58.    t    The main psychological warfare effort during the year has been a continued campaign for surrenders.    Leaflets, voiceaircraft, wireless, press, public addresses and live shows havebeen used to put over to the terrorists the theme that there is&apos;no hope of their achieving a final victory and that they will be fairly treated if they surrender.     Reasons for surrender arevaried, but food shortage, security force pressure, loss of faith in&apos; victory, disagreement with policy and dislike of leaders are all of importance.     These points are exploitedcontinually in our psychological warfare campaign.     when thearmistice came in Indo-China we stressed to the terrorists thatthey were now fighting alone, with no hope of help from outside and that they would be well advised to give up the struggle and live in peace.      Ue now know that some of the terrorists whoha.ve surrendered since that time have been impressed by this argument.59. In 1953 the average monthly surrender rate was 31 - thisyear the monthly average has dropped to 18.     There were several reasons for this drop.   There has been a re-organisation of the terrorists to encourage more aggressive action against selectedtargets, a sure morale raiser.    The Communist success in FrenchIndo-China and their subsequent diplomatic success at Genevamust also have raised the morale and hope of some.   Now that most of the iwaverers have been eliminated, the percentage of hard core -communists has increased; those Slaverers that are left are transferred to cultivation duties in the deep jungleand great care -is taken to see that they have few opportunities to defect.In our psychological warfare it is, of course, impossibleto give any guarantee other than &quot;You will be fairly dealt withand will not be ill-treated&quot;..     Fear of what will happen tothem if they surrender is, therefore, a powerful deterrent tomany terrorists.    Though much has been done to break down this feeling of fear, it is difficult for leaflets and voice aircraft to compete with the Communist leader on the spot, who will tellevery conceivable lie to counter our propaganda.1^,&apos;EM^LJLQJS)^ PUBLI.C .&apos;60. The psychological warfare campaign outside the jungleis carried out by using the same media as used against the terrorists in the jungle.     In addition we publish two Chinesenewspapers, &quot;New Path News&quot; and &quot;Struggle News&quot;, which are circulated amongst the public.The performance of the Malay Home Guard, during the year has, v/ith few exceptions, been extremely satisfactory.     Theprogress made with more than half the Chinese Home Guard hasbeen commendable, though it remains to be seen whether they areto prove themselves a reliable force.     The problem of aresidual hard core of Communist sympathisers in the ChineseHome Guard remains to be solved.
InO -T7ZTThe main aims are to bring the terrorist organisationinto contempt, to discourage Communist recruiting, to stiffenresistance to Communist demands for food and finance, to spreadstories of how well those who surrender are treated, to urgeco-operation with the Government and lastly, a most importantcommitment, to sweeten the bitter pill of f..od and other restrictions which are hated by the public, but are so necessary if our operations are to be successful.Public co-operation, though much better than in theearlier days of the Emergency, still leaves much to be desired.The principal factor hindering full co-operation is the localfear of the terrorists, who do not hesitate to murder a few people in order to encourage a healthy respect for themselves.The Communists are prepared to be absolutely ruthless over this.One such murder of a civilian can completely silence the publicover a wide area and produce for the Communists a good measureof support, even though it may be involuntary.REWARDS.SI, As a practical inducement to terrorists to surrenderand to the public to help the security forces, a system of monetary rewards is in operation^     Broadly rewards may be paidto terrorists who induce two or more of their comrades to surrender with them, who hand over an LMG on surrender, or whokill other terrorists prior to surrendering.    The public canearn rewards for inducing the surrender of a terrorist, forcapturing a terrorist, for information, or for any outstandingaction which assists the Government or the security forces to eliminate Communist terrorism.    This latter category may extend to the killing of armed terrorists in circumstances which justifysuch killing.The total sum expended on rewards in 1954, in consequenceof this policy, was  107,000,CONCLUSION.62.        We know that our psychological wa.rfa.re penetrates to the terrorists.    The fact that the surrender rate has neverthelessfallen off indicates that we are now up against a toughproposition.   Spectacular results are unlikely, but it is interesting and encouraging that a number of recently surrenderedterrorists have been impressed by the hopelessness of theirstruggle.POLITICAL.65. It has been said above that public co-operation in the suppression of the Emergency leaves much to be desired.However regrettable this statement, it is true.   The peopleof Malaya have no definite -attitude towards the Emergency.Ef..eh of&quot; the three major races has its own viewpoint and it isonly at the top,  and that recently, that a national Emergencyoutlook has been established.
212 oFor some years now expert anti-Communist propagandistshave made a great effort to win the hearts end minds of the peoples of Malaya but regrettably, for Emergency purposes, ithas to be recorded - in the words of the late Director Generalof Information Services - that the majority of the people have so far been^brought only to a state of &quot;reasonably friendlyapathy&quot;.     Even if this label may appear somewhat pessimistic,it is nevertheless true that the great majority of Chinesevillagers end tappers are still too frightened to stop helping the terrorists.      To assist in an understanding of the problem,the attitude of the various communities concerned are outlinedbelow.THE MALAYS.64. The Malays are considered first, not only because it is their country, but also because together with the Euro^oeansthey fill most of the senior posts in the administration andthey provide the great majority of the Police force end sevenout of the eight infantry battalions in the Federation militaryforces.The Malays heve, of course, their problems.     The Rulersand the feudal chiefs realise that&apos;their position in a modernMalaya is insecure and at all levels the economic domination ofthe Chinese is feared.   However, there has been hitherto nodifficulty in obtaining recruits for the fighting services andthe Police.During the past eighteen months the Malayan CommunistParty has paid considerable attention to propaganda amongst the malays, but has met with little success.   Problems in the future,which might be exploited by the Malayan Communist Party, are thetendency of the United Malay nationalist Oganisation to be swayedby its left wing element, the left wing tendencies of some Malaypoliticians, the Malay irridentist movement in South Siam and anti-colonial feeling amongst the Indonesiens in Malaya.   an example of the danger may be seen in the strongly anti-british policy of the &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot;, one of the Malay vernacularnewspapers.In certain areas the Malays do to a limited extentsupport the terrorists by selling them food,  but this is mainly for profit and not out of any sense of conviction.   Fundamentallythey are sound.   Without their support both now and in the pastit is fair to say that our position would be untenable.THE CHIHESE.65. In c-nsidering the Chinese attitude to the Emergency itis important to understand that they ere individualists and thatthey came to Malaya to make money-.    Long and bitter experience in China has brought them to beliofo that it is dangerous to be associated with authority.     Their loyalty lies primarily to the family, to a lesser degree to the clan and practically not atall to the community.     Their attitude to military service isaptly expressed in the Chinese proverb&quot;You do not use good iron to make a nail,You do not use a good man to make a solider&quot;.
Only 4/. of the Police force is Chinese, though it is only fair to say that for many&apos;years past in the Malay States theywere not admitted to the&apos; uniform branch of the force and alsothat recruiting to the Federation Regiment has been satisfactory.This lack of racial balance in the Police force has had thefurther unfortunate effect of exacerbating the normal Chinesedislike of authority. \66. It is true that amongst the small educated and wealthyminority at the top, many of whose families have been settledfor several generations, there \is a growing feeling that, inorder to survive in a modern Ma,&apos;! ay a, they must have a politicalstake in the country    This hasbeen accentuated by the realisation in 1954 that Nationalist China is finished as a world power.     This ia-mori t,y is also probably beginning torealise that, in their own interests, they must help to end theEmergency although the free world1s set-back in Indo-China has caused many of them to look uneasily over their shoulders, to reflect upon the British defeat in 1942 and to wonder whetherinsurance should not now be taken out with the enemy, in the traditional Chinese manner.To this class freedom from fear of outside aggression and confidence in internal security are all important.     Theyhave had a bad shock and nothing will cause them to come downfirmly on our side other than a SEATO with &quot;teeth&quot; in it and the conviction both that we shall remain here until the Emergencyis ended and after that to protect Malaya against external aggression.     Internally they must be assured-&apos; of a stake inthis country.67, The other section uf educated Chinese is the youth.The Malayan political set-up&apos; and the traditional Chinese systemoffers them little opportunity of gaining   influence, they are usually out of sympathy with their elders and,  shadowingeverything, there is the tremendous emotional fact that China is,for the first time in modern history, a world power,,     Theirteachers are often young, many of them left wing, fascinated byChina and frustrated by lack of opportunity for higher Chineseeducation.     How serious this situation is may be exemplifiedby the fact that a significant number of Chinese of the studentage group left the Federation and Singapore for further studiesin China during the year.    Communism has a strong intellectualappeal to these young men and women and it is from the schoolsthat the Malayan Communist Party confidently expects to gainrecruits, for its underground organisation, and for its armedelements.     The Government is concerned at this situation and wecan expect counter measures in 1955.68. The great mass of the Chinese population have decided to sit on the fence,  safeguarding themselves and their families,making money where and how they can and keeping in with boththe Government and the terrorists.     The Chinese press adopts an equally negative attitude.    In some new villages there is thebeginning of a community spirit and a sense of stability, but until we have eliminated practically every local leadingterrorist we cannot expect real progress to be made.    Theseterrorists have, after all, been in the area not only during theEmergency, but often since the start of the Japanese occupation.Little-support is to bo expected from the inhabitant-s in newefforts to eliminate these terrorists, many of whom are related to the villagers.       L start has been made in^re&apos;moving terrorists1relatives to other States/Settlements or together areas within their own State, but it is too early to say&apos; how effective these measures will be.
THE INDIANS.59.       -Apart from a small educated minority - many of themlawyers - the Indians (who are mostly from Southern India)continue to play little part in the political life of thecountry.     The great majority are employed on large rubberestates and as labourers in the various public services.    Itmight be expected that they would, as the nearest equivalentto an industrial proletariat, be a fertile field for Communismbut in fact this has not so far been the case.Partly clue perhaps to the lead set by Messrs. gandhi and Nehru, to who;1, all violence is professedly anathema, partly to the fact that they have been more closely associated with european leadership and paradoxically partly to their povertythey have never been wholehearted supporters of the MalayanCommunist Party.     A further contributory factor may be theintelligent handling of Malaya&apos;s young trade unions.     In thisconnection it is interesting that the Communists, true to form,have already murdered a number of trade union officials.Apart from one area, where a notorious Tamil terroristhas gained a considerable measure of scared support, the great mass of the Indian population plays little part either way.THE CEYLONESE AND EURASIANS.70. These minority groups are extremely loyal, but theyhave neither the numbers nor the economic power to play morethan a limited part in the life of the community.THE- EUROPEANS.71. The Europeans (excluding Government servants) aredivided into two completely distinct categories.     Op. the onehand there are those who live in the large towns, who do not go about in danger of their lives, and on the other there arethe planters and miners who have been in the forefront of the battle since 1948.Almost all are worried by the uncertain political futureby the dangers to capital which are implied by an independentMalaya and by recent developments in Indo-China.   However,their heart is sound, they help to keep the finances of thecountry going and the Government&apos;s relations with them are good.European Government servants naturally tend to express some concern about their future, with self-government of Malayaapproaching.THE PROBLEM.72, It has frequently been stated and it is still true thatthe political or psychological side of the struggle is three-quarters of the problem and the shooting side only about one-quarter.   A large Army and a very large Police Force and home guard are fighting an enemy without the effective support of thepeople and with the terrain entirely in his favour / &quot;  Food
212 xand money are being handed&apos;over to the terrorists, not perhaps in large quantities,but in quite sufficient quantities to sustainthem in active operations against us.     Many tappers subscribe10/-  a month and carry small bags of rice to the bandits on theedges of the rubber estates,   Many shopkeepers and small estateovmers are similarly supplying  25,  50 or even  100 per month and supplying medicines, clothing and rice free of charge inspite of the vigilance of the Police and the Army.     The problem is in some measure aggravated by the fact that, although we havebeen able to provide a good degree of security within the villages, we are still unable to protect the people properlywhen they go 2 or 3 miles outside to their work.73. For the reasons given above most of the half-millionChinese living in the new villages and on the rubber estatesare &quot;sitting on the fence&quot; in order to be sure that they are on the right side at the finish.    It is not so much a matter of winning their hearts as a question of convincing them whichside is going to win the struggle.     when British officials from the High Commissioner down assure them that the Britishare going to stay until the Emergency is successfully ended,they remember the Japanese success of 1941/42 and they wonderfirst whether our assurances will be carried out in practiceif the Emergency is not ended reasonably soon and,  secondly,whether the ending of the Emergency might not be quicklyfollowed by a British withdrawal and Communist domination fromthe north.After all, the propaganda directed to the Chinesevillagers is Government propaganda delivered by government officials and is automatically suspect.    The Chinese areperfectly capable of listening to the Government with one ear andto the Communists with the other, in the same way as a Chinese.Home Guard carries a shotgun on duty in the evening and handsover his subscription to the terrorists as a tapper in the morning.    Although Government propaganda has done much to convince the villagers of the advantages of good government,and that the schools, roads, fences, lighting, drains etc. oftheir villages are si, ns of our permanent indications towards them, no amount of Government propaganda is likely, withinmeasurable time, to convince the ordinary Chinese about the outcome of the battle.    The only people who have any hope of doing so are their own Chinese leaders, local as well as federal.These Chinese leaders, who are shortly going to take a much larger share in the Government of their adopted country, arc nowrealising the dangers of the Communist threat in South-east asia ana are fully alive to the apparent risks they will run ifmilitant Communism is not wiped   out in Malaya.74. It is therefore encougaging to report that some of theChinese leaders, many of whoa v/ill shortly be electioneeringfor the State or Federal Parliaments, are slowly becomingconvinced of the need to change the altitude of the Chinese andother new villagers to a point where they will co-operateheartily with&apos; the Government by stopping tho flow of food andother vital supplies to the terrorists.ASSISTANCE FROM POLITICAL LEADERS.75. In order to associate the peoples of Malaya much&apos; more closely with the effort that is being made to crush theCommunist rebellion, five political leaders (two Malay, oneChinese, one Indian, one European) have recently been invited tobecome full members of the Director of Operations&apos; Committee.. /23.
The effect has been happy, for not only have two of then nowstated publicly that the first plank in their political platformis the ending of the Emergency, but discussion in committee hasbeen wider and better informed than formerly.    &quot;There is nodoubt, too, that when the agreement of these new members &quot;to anunpopular measure has been secured, it will be found more acceptable to the public end to the press.On or shortly after 1st January 1955 similar widerracial representation was established on all State, settlement and District War Executive Committees.       This, combined withthe recent considerably greater interest on the part of thestate Chinese Advisory Boards and the beginning of active workin the Districts by Chinese leaders,  seems to offer some hopeof changing the Chinese villagers&apos; minds.    If large numbers^of chinese can thereby be shaken from their attitude of watchfulneutrality, then the year 1955 may perhaps see a definiteimprovement in the Emergency situation.CONCLUSION.76. While most Malays are on our side, the same cannot besaid of the Chinese.     The inclusion of community leaders inthe committees responsible for   Emergency operations offers thebest chance of binding the population together in a determined effort to end the Emergency. &quot;    It is too early yet&apos; to see thefull effects of this step.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.77. The present level of the Emergency is such that the life of the country proceeds without significant interference.     the murder rate is steady at quite a low level (7 per month for thelast 6 months) and is dispersed in such a way that there is no great impact on any one district or any particular race.     Mostof the incidents are not of a serious kind, and those of an aggressive nature are&apos;barely one a week.     Jchore and Perakaccount for the great majority of the incidents.     The only other States which are really affected by the Emergency arePahang, Negri Sembilan and, to a lesser extent, Selangor andKedah.     The remainder can almost be said to be free from theeffects of the Emergency.78. There is little overall direction from the politburoof the MCP.     The morale of the terrorists (who still numberover 4,000) is low and it is likely that it will remain   soas long as there is little hope of external intervention and aswe continue the pressure which deprives them of supplies, inparticular food and arms.     Their steady casualty rate of 50to 60 a month also undoubtedly affects their spirit.     However,the only move&apos;which might make the hard core terrorists give upthe struggle would be direct pressure from Peking.     Meanwhileundoubtedly their aim is to remain in being prepared againstthe time when outside assistance, or outbreaks of communal.striferesulting upon the withdrawal of the British, will enable themto come out into the open and take   over the country..      the malayan Communist Party leaders are beginning to realise that.the prospect of outside assistance is remote^ repeated &apos;authoritative statements should help to convince them that theBritish will not withdraw until the Communists&apos;have been finallybeaten. /24?...
79. The existing strength of the security forces is sufficientto hold the Emergency at the present level.   Indeed, some slightbut progressive improvement may be expected unless the MalayanCommiLiist Party changes its policy.     It is unfortunate, however,that our operations to disrupt the three main deep jungle basesare slowed down by the lack of a second SAS regiment.    Theaddition of a company of the Parachute Regiment in March 1955will be extremely welcome, but five or six squadrons of SAStype continuously on operations are required to achieve our aims in the deep jungle.Two SAS regiments, together with 20 efficient mediumhelicopters (giving the daily availability of 10 r-lreadyrequested), would offer good military prospects of speeding upthe shooting side of the Emergency in 1955.80. Really significant progress in the Emergency as a whole will only be made if we gain the whole-hearted support of thepeople.     They will not give this support unless the following three fears are removed.-(a) For the villagers, fear of local terroristdomination.(b) For the better educated and better off classes,fear of external aggression.(c) For many, fear of British withdrawal and of thepossible resulting internal strife.Only the removal of these three fears will get the malayan peoples (particularly the Chinese) off the fence, whichis the crux of the problem.   None of them will be removed by thepresent military force at our disposal.     The security forces have for 6 years been striving to reviove the first but it isnow clear that this, in addition to the other two, is largely a political as well as a military matter.     A great deal depends&apos;on whether the Chinese and other leaders seise the opportunitynow before them to persuade the Chinese villagers to&quot;stopsupplying the Communists.   The second fear can be considerablylessened if SEATO is made a practical reality.      The third calls for repeated assurances that we shall not leave Malaya until the malayan Communist Party has been crushed.Even after the Emergency is over it will be essential,if internal strife is to be avoided, to continue to affirm thatwe shall still not withdraw until a true partnership ofcommunities has been established in Malaya.10th January, 1955.DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS.
