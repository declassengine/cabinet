Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1955SECRET Copy No. 74C. (55) 7519th March, 1955CABINETELECTORAL reform memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs on 21st February I received on behalf of the Prime Minister an all-partydeputation from the Committee for a Royal Commission on Voting, led bySir Geoffrey Shakespeare, Bart.2. The deputation pressed for the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the present electoral system and alternative systems, for both parlia-mentary and local government elections. They explained that they did not asa body support any particular reform, but felt that there was a strong case forenquiry because of the defects of our present system.3. They said that the main defect of the present system was that it is nottruly representative: only two of the twelve general elections since 1910 produced a Government representing a majority of those voting; many members were returned on a minority vote; and the strength of the parties in Parliament usuallybore no relation to the votes given for them. This was described as a system of&quot; Government by fluke &quot; and was said to create a sense of grievance in minorityparties and apathy in constituencies with a permanent majority either way.4. Other points made were that electoral reform is desirable as a check onextremism, and that our system is not necessarily suitable for the Colonies, and thereport of a Royal Commission would be valuable to those responsible for framingcolonial constitutions.5. The deputation pointed out that there had been no impartial enquiry intoelectoral systems since 1910, and that since then much experience had beenaccumulated of the working of other systems in the Commonwealth and abroad,and in the election of the university members here. They suggested that an authoritative analysis of this experience would be valuable, and generally, thatthe proceedings of a Royal Commission would help to educate and enlightenpublic opinion on this important subject.6. The deputation recalled that the Prime Minister when Leader of theOpposition in 1950 had called for a Select Committee to enquire into the question of electoral reform. (Official Report, 7th March, 1950, Col. 143.) (The PrimeMinister has since refused requests for an enquiry, explaining that circumstanceshave altered-Official Report, 10th March, 1953, Col. 1127 and 27th July, 1954,Cols. 233-5.)7. I undertook to report the deputation^ views to the Prime Minister and theCabinet. Accordingly I circulate this memorandum for the information of mycolleagues, and I shall be glad to have their advice on the reply that should be sentto the Committee.G. LL.-G.Home Office, S.W.1,17th March, 1955.47806
