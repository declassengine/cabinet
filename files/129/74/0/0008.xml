Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955SECRET Copy No.    gC. (55) 5823rd February, 1955CABINETCOAL prices note by the Minister of Fuel and power the Economic Policy Committee this morning considered my Memorandumon coal prices (E.A. (55) 39) and asked me to reconsider two points, the firstconcerning house coal and the second the possibility of including in a government statement which might be made to-morrow the announcement of a coal price increase (E.A. (55) 7th Meeting, Item 2). I can meet what I think were the wishes of the Committee on both points.2. As to house coal, my colleagues were anxious to prevent any price increase from falling on the grade of coal which is generally regarded as the &quot; average &quot; or&quot; characteristic &quot; grade, namely Group 4. I have &quot;discussed this with the national coal Board and they have in consequence revised their proposals as follows:  Group	Per cent.	Present London		Original	Revised	of supply	Prices		Proposals	Proposals		s.	d.	s.   d.	s.   d.1	2	171	10	Increase 14   0	Increase 10  02	11	157	10	12   0	5   03	21	146	10	9   0	1   84	25	136	10	5   0	No increase5	24	127	10	No increase	53                    536	11	119	10	;?              55	55                    3 V7	6	109	10	55                    55	35                    533.	If these revised proposals are			accepted, the prices of two-thirds of all	house coal will not be increased at all.				This can be justified by reference to our	concern for the cost of living. Only the &quot; luxury &quot; house coals will be increased in price. The direct effect on the retail cost-of-living index of these house coal price increases will be negligible.4. On the timing and method of announcement, I can now suggest to theChancellor of the Exchequer words for inclusion in the Government statement.These would be to the effect, that with the agreement of the Government proposals put forward by the National Coal Board for an increase in coal prices would beput into operation as soon as the necessary consultations with the Consumers&apos;Councils had taken place.5. I ask the Cabinet to endorse the proposals for a coal price increase inE.A. (55) 39 as amended in this note.G. L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1955.47712
