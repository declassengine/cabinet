Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.  ggC. (55) 5928th February, 1955CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation think the Cabinet would wish to be informed of the present position of road haulage disposals.2. Under the Transport Act, 1953, the number of vehicles to be disposed ofwas approximately 32,500. Up to 31st January, 1955, 18,347 had been offered for sale of which 12.698, he., 69 per cent., had been sold.3. Although disposals began in January, 1954, it was not until the summerthat sales really got under way. This was in part because earlier sale lists contained a large proportion of transport units which included premises. Experience hasshown that such units are not attractive to buyers.4. Whereas 9,286, i.e., 87 per cent., of the 10,624 vehicles offered withoutpremises were sold, only 3,025, 41 per cent., of the 7,321 put up with premises havebeen sold.5. Towards the end of 1954 and at the beginning of this year sales were at a rate of approximately 250 per week.6. Lists containing 2,367 vehicles have recently been published; the resultof these should be available during April.7. The most conspicuous and significant feature of sales so far has been thecontrast between the success of sales in small units and the lack of demand forthe larger units. Of the 12,698 vehicles sold up to 31st January 10,280 vehicleshave been sold in units of less than 15 vehicles and 7,516 of these in units of lessthan 5 vehicles.8. On the other hand there have been very few sales of large units. Abrochure was published in January offering the remaining unoffered medium and large units in England and Wales. These amount to about 5,800 vehicles. Theseare due for tender in early March. The Disposals Board advise me that there is little known demand.9. The same situation applies to specialist units such as meat vehicles andthe parcels service.10. The latter has been formed into a company. But the company methodhas so far not been successful, only 402 vehicles in 3 companies having been sold.In my judgment we are severely handicapped by the provisions of the transport act, 1953, which prevents sale of shares in road haulage companies except whereall the shares are sold at the same time. This is in marked contrast to the more flexible provisions of the Iron and Steel Act.11. Varying opinions have been expressed to me on the effect on the national interest of a continuing sale in small units, for which there still appears to be asubstantial demand, accompanied by a failure to sell in large units. Opinion in trade and industry with respect to this &quot; fragmentation&quot; of road services isconflicting. We have not yet, however, reached the point at which any seriousbody of opinion suggests that too many vehicles have been sold in small units.47727
2And it is, of course, not to be assumed that the road haulier who buys, for example,a unit comprising three vehicles is only operating a business of that size. In manycases he is in fact buying one or two vehicles to add to an existing fleet..-, 12. I am not at present asking the Cabinet for any decisions on this matter.By the early summer I hope we shall have offered for sale in one way or anotherall but a few hundred of the vehicles covered by the Transport Act, 1953. In thelight of our complete experience of these offers and their result the Cabinet may wish to consider the matter further.J. A. B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation. IV. 1,25th February, 1955.\
