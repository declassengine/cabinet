secret(55) 622nd Ma:geha 1955CABINETGULPED WEAPONS FOPv. THE army memorandum by the Minister of Defence and theSecretary of State for WarThe Army need a ground-to-ground guided missile to carry a tactical atomic warhead to ranges from 3 0 to 75 miles accurately in allweathers and without regard to the air situation0    Their intention is to equip our divisions in Germany with this weapon,2,        In 1953, the Defence Research Policy Committee agreed that,having rega.rd to the urgency of the requirement and to the overloading ofthe British research and development effort on guided weapons, it wouldbe desirable for the Army to adopt an American weapons system,3,        The War Office accordingly studied the American weapons systemknown as CORPORAL and found that it would meet the Army requirement.They now wish to obtain enough CORPORAL ground equipments and missilesto set up training schools in the United Kingdom and to equip two batterieswhich would be allocated to our forces in Germany,    For this purpose they need 8 sets of ground equipment and 113 missiles.    The atomic warheadwould not be supplied by the United States but would be developed in thiscountry,4,        It is in accordance with oui- general policy to develop closercollaboration with the Americans on defence research and development,and the then Mdnister of Supply had discussions with the United states secretary of Defence in June, 1954 to extend and strengthen this collabora-tion in the whole field of guided missiles.     Unless this policy isvigorously pursued; we shall fall further and further behind, as our own resources, particularly of trained scientific manpower, are quite inadequate to meet all the needs of the Services,    There can be no hard and fast rulewhetherf when the United Kingdom decides to depend upon Americanresearch and development), the end product should be manufactured in thiscountry und.er licence or obtained from United States production.    In thecase of the CORPORAL system, the Ministry of Defence, the War Officeand the Ministry of Supply consider that, because of the smallness of the requirement, the delay which would be caused by adapting the equipment for British manufacture and the lack of resources io undertake this adaptationthe right course is to acquire the equipment from the United States,5Q        The United States Army is about to place a bulk order forCORPORAL to meet its own needs and they have informed the War office that if British requirements are to be met they must be included in thisbulk order.    They have said that our bid must be in by 1st March if it isto be included, but under pressure from the British Joint Services mission in Washington they have said that they hope to esstend this date until15th March,
6.        The price quoted by the United States for the 8 sets of ground equipment   and 113 missiles which the War Office wish to obtain is 9. 54 millions.    Deliveries would begin early in 1957.    The CORPORALsystem is expected to remain in operational use until the mid&quot;19S0sc    TheBritish atomic warhead would be available by 1959.7.        As the equipment is required for British forces under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), there is noprima facie reason why it should not be supplied free under the MutualDefence Assistance Programme.    United States representatives in Londonhave however warned us that the supply of guided weapons under the mutual Defence Assistance Programme would raise a new issue ofprinciple which would take time to resolve.    They have also said that itis most unlikely that any funds could be made available even if the issueof principle were resolved in our favour.    They have therefore urged thatwe should undertake to pay for the equipment in dollars if it is decided tobe ineligible for free supply or if United States funds cannot be madeavailable.    Without this undertaking there is no prospect that the Depart&quot;ment of the Army would accept the War Office bid in time for it to beincluded in their bulk order.80        If we had to buy the equipment, payment would be phased over three years.9,        The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that, because of ourworsening balance of payments and the fiscal measures he has recently had to take, he cannot give a quick affirmative decision on a matterinvolving so heavy a dollar liability.    Unfortunately, for the reasons wehave already explained, time is extremely pressing.10.       If the Army is to have a tactical atomic weapon, there is no alternative to CORPORAL.    It would take at least eight years to develop an equivalent British system and this could be done only at the expense ofother British guided weapons of the highest priority.    The American forces which in the event of war would be fighting alongside the British divisions in Germany will be equipped with CORPORAL, and we do not think itacceptable that our own forces should be deprived of this weapon.    Further-more, a decision not to adopt an American weapon when a suitable oneexists and can be obtained without adding to our own research anddevelopment burden, would be a most retrograde step and would undermine the whole basis of our collaboration with the United States.11.       We must therefore ask the Cabinet to approve the acquisitionfrom the United States of the 8 ground equipments and 113 missiles requiredby the Army and to accept the liability that we shall have to find the dollarsourselves if we cannot obtain free supply under the American MutualDefence Assistance Programme.H.M.A.irl.1st March, 1955.-2
