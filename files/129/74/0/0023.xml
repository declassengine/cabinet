(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)----i----1.-----------------------,-------m-------------i_______________i___SECRETC.(55) 7316th March, 1955UNITED STATES AID FOR PAKISTANMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation have to-day seen the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s memo-randum (C, (55) 72) with its proposal for the acceptance of a 50 per centshipping requirement as part of a proposed transaction in raw cotton.2.        I do not agree that this is &quot;a point of detail&quot;i    On the contrary,it raises a major question of principle of major importance to the shipping industry,3.       This and connected issues are reviewed in a paper now before theEconomic Policy Committee (E. A. (55) 52).4.       The President of the Board of Trade&apos;s proposal is that we should accept a 50 per cent shipping condition in a transaction under United StatesPublic Law 480.    There has been constant pressure on us and othercountries to accept such a condition.    It has only been accepted once, by turkey,    All the other countries concerned, including Scandinavia, holland and France, have resisted.    Norway refused to accept United States coalwith such a shipping condition attached.5,       We ourselves in the course of discussion of a proposal relatingto the purchase of tobacco for sterling with the counterpart funds to beapplied to build houses for families of United States airmen have, becauseof the shipping condition included, urged that such arrangements be not made under Law 480.6.        The importance of the point is this.    Public Law 480 is not an&quot;aid&quot; measure but a measure for the disposal of United States agriculturalsurpluses.    Its purpose is thus quite distinct from United States PublicLaw 665, which is a measure embodying &quot;aid&quot; provisions.    There is allthe difference in the world between accepting conditions when you aregiven a present, and accepting them in respect of a transaction which,though it may be beneficial to you or others, is in essence part of adisposal of surpluses operation,7.       And from the practical point of view, if this country as the major maritime nation in the world accepts shipping conditions in a PublicLaw 480 transaction, it will, in my judgment, destroy generally inter *-national resistance to the imposition of such conditions.    That indeedis the American purpose,8,       I do not agree with the President of the Board of Trade that thedecision of the Economic Policy Committee referred to in paragraph 3of C, (55) 72 expressly or impliedly accepted 50 per cent shipping conditions under Public Law 480,    Such interpretation is inconsistent with thedecision of the Committee, at the same meeting, in respect of purchases of tobacco.COPY NOCABINET
9.        The United Kingdom shipping industry, which earns  220 millions a year, is threatened by, and much concerned about, flag discrimination inits various forms.    The industry would be deeply disturbed by acceptanceof a shipping condition under Public Law 480.    I think the long term interests of this country would be seriously prejudiced by such a concession to flag discrimination.10.       In my view this consideration is sufficiently important to justify our refusal of the 50 per cent shipping condition even if, as a result, thedeal falls through,11.       It is not, however, necessary to assume that it will.    There are indications that American agricultural interests are disturbed at thedifficulties which are being encountered in disposing of surpluses as aresult of this condition and it is possible that if we stand firm the americans may feel it necessary to abandon the condition.12.       Further, it seems to me by no means clear that this is the onlypoint on which the agreement may fall through.    It would obviously be unfortunate if we were to surrender this principle in the course of negotiations which in the event came to nothing.13.      I am glad to know that the President agrees that a 50 per centshipping condition is entirely unacceptable in respect of the shipment of textiles to Pakistan from this country.    But it seems to me whollyillogical, therefore, to argue for acceptance of such a condition on the shipment of the cotton from the United States to this country.    That legof the transaction is clearly of a trade character only, with no elements of aid:  shipping conditions therefore would seem, logically, to be evexi moreindefensible than on the second leg.14.      I would ask therefore -(a) that no decision be taken to accept a 50 per centshipping condition in respect of this transactionuntil it has been possible for the economic policy Committee to review fully the implications-tions of such a condition;(b) that it be made clear to the United States Govern-ment that we are not prepared to accept anyshipping condition as part of this or anytransaction under Public Law 480.J .A.B.-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,W.l.15th March, 1955.
