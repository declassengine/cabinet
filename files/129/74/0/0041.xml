Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1955SECRET Copy No.C. (55) 915th April, 1955CABINETTHE MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES commission memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI am circulating this paper for the information of my colleagues.2. We must in the near future make a number of new references to the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission, which, otherwise, will soon be obliged to say that any delay in their work is due to failure by the Governmentto refer cases to them for examination.3. On 31st March the Economic Policy Committee discussed what furtherreferences I should make (E.A. (55) 12th Meeting, Item 3), and agreed that thefollowing subjects might suitably be referred in the near future:  (i) The supply and erection of structural steel.(ii) Electric street-lighting equipment.(iii) Kegs and drums.I propose, therefore, to refer them. The announcement will probably be madein three or four weeks&apos; time but is unlikely to be sensational.4. Certain other references will be made later on in perhaps six or sevenweeks&apos; time. Some of them are agreed and some others need further discussionwith my colleagues, which I shall arrange for at a later date.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W. I,4th April, 1955.47883
