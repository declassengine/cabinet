Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1955SECRET Copy No.  ggC. (55) 7619 th March, 1955CABINETCOTTON industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI circulate for information two papers by the Cotton Board; the first(Annex A) sets out their recommendations for Government action to protect the cotton industry and the second (Annex B) the case on which these recommendations are based.2. The Cotton Board will meet the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and myself on 24th March.I do not propose that we should seek to take any decision about the cotton industryproposals until after that meeting has taken place. It may, however, help if, ina few paragraphs, I outline what I conceive the main issues to be.3. The Cotton Board are explicit in setting out the main lines of the actionwhich they wish to see taken. In the second paragraph of Annex A they make their aim abundantly clear. They regard this as a long-term problem. They wantus to tackle the tariff. They wish to see the end of duty-free entry for manufacturedcotton goods from the Commonwealth. They want us to negotiate our way outof that situation as quickly as we can, and the rest of the paper is, in effect, astatement of the preliminary action which they think would be necessary in orderto get us launched upon such a negotiation. They make it quite plain that theywould wish us to act over a wider field than India and a wider range than cottongrey cloth. They propose the immediate imposition of a quota on imports ofgrey cloth for the home market. As to the grey cloth which comes in for processing &apos;here and re-export, they propose that we should watch, but not at this stage impede,the level of this trade. They do not deal with the wider problem of Lancashire&apos;sloss of export markets generally.4. A quota could not, in any event, be a long-term solution to the importproblem. This could only be achieved by tariff action. Quota restriction would,however, be needed as a temporary holding measure while the tariff was negotiatedand the necessary legislation enacted.5. As to the immediate effect of the proposed action, it looks as though the quota restriction which they propose would have the effect of reducing grey clothimports into the home market by about 30 or 40 million yards oh last year. this compares with a Lancashire production of 2,000 million yards. (Imports of allcotton cloth from all sources in 1954 were 267 million square yards; of this236 million square yards was cotton grey cloth, of which about 80 million square yards was for the home market. The proposed reduction is on this lastfigure.) Though the effect would be small, it might perhaps be said that it wouldgive some sense of security by preventing further increases in imports for thehome market.6. The main thing about a quota of this kind is that it cannot be continuedindefinitely. But once it had been imposed we could not go back and dispense with protection. We would ,be forced to move on to the replacement of the quotaby a tariff.47813 B
Board of Trade, S.W.1,18th March, 1955.ANNEX ACOTTON GOODS IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOMRECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONMemorandum from the Cotton Board1. The following memorandum is submitted in response to a request from thePresident of the Board of Trade that the Cotton Board should furnish theGovernment with recommendations as to the nature of the action to be taken ifthe Government decided to restrict imports of grey cloth.2. At the earliest moment that an appropriate occasion can be found, theBritish Government should negotiate the exclusion of cotton goods from thetariff-free provisions of its Commonwealth Trade Agreements. Free entry would never have been conceded in the first place if conditions had then been as they areto-day. Cotton goods are now being imported from some commonwealth countries in such increasing quantities as to cause and threaten serious injury to producers in the United Kingdom. Without implying a view as to what rates of duty would be adequate to meet the situation, it may be said that the British cottonindustry would regard as acceptable a preferential margin in favour, of commonwealth countries in order to maintain the conception of ImperialPreferences on both sides.7. The external effect of any action on the lines proposed is likely to be far-reaching. The re-negotiation of the Indian Agreement which would be involved would be costly in the field of preferences; our exports to India amount to over  100millions a year, on 20 per cent, of which we enjoy preferences. Moreover, the factthat action would extend to Hong Kong would manifestly present great difficulties,and unless the present most-favoured-nation rate proved large enough to hold theIndian or Hong Kong imports and perhaps to contain an element of preference forthem, it would be necessary to re-negotiate the most-favoured-nation rateitself. This,too, would involve considerable difficulties; it would have to be justified on its merits and would be expensive in relation to our trade with Europe.8. It is quite clear that if we did find it necessary to act on the lines described above we would precipitate embarrassing demands for similar protection over a wide range of goods. Competition from duty-free manufactured goods from theCommonwealth is already giving rise to protectionist pressure. To take justone example, I have been pressed for the last six months, and am still being pressed, to check the import of cheap gloves from Hong Kong.9. This seems to be the measure of the problems which confront us. It isclear that any step on the lines proposed is likely to involve political complicationsin relation to the Commonwealth and to prove expensive in loss of preferences andin the possible re-negotiation of tariffs. We shall have to measure this cost against any resultant benefit which might accrue to Lancashire.10. I am bound to repeat what I have already said to my colleagues, that no solution of this kind is in any event likely to help Lancashire with her main problem,which is declining exports. The only way in which the Government could giveimmediate help with this problem would be in the field of purchase tax.11. The above are merely my preliminary reflections upon the issues whichconfront us. It may be convenient to my colleagues if I circulate another paper on this subject after we have had the meeting with the Cotton Board.P. T.
3. Regardless of what future policy and action in the field of tariffs may be,it is recommended that steps should be taken to impose import licensing on a quota basis immediately.4. In framing recommendations, the Cotton Board recognises that the precise form of import licensing and quota regulations would have to be chosen with regard,firstly, to the immediate dangers now confronting the industry; secondly, to the risks of advantage being taken of loop-holes for increased imports after therestriction of the types now being imported had been enforced; and thirdly, to theprovisions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the various trade agreements in virtue of which the British action might have to be justified andsubsequently sustained.5. The excessive importation of grey cloth for home market consumption isthe basic cause of the present and potentially greater injury to domestic UnitedKingdom producers. To deal first with that issue, it is recommended that such imports should be reduced by quota restrictions applied on the basis of total volume from all sources by quantities stipulated in yardage. It is also recommended as a consequential measure that similar restrictions, but by weight,should be applied to imports of yarn. The quotas applied to retained imports should not exceed the average of the three past years of 1952, 1953 and 1954. Itshould be open to all to apply for import licences. Those desiring to import shouldbe allowed to apply, by reference to the proportion which their application bearsto their total turnover in the home trade, or account should be taken of other validreasons given for importation. By the adoption of these or similar methods,pre-emptive applications for imports can be checked and possible dangers of undueconcentration on imports from any particular source can be dealt with.6. There can be no doubt that the limitation of grey cloth imports will create an immediate danger of a transfer of business to the importation of colouredwoven and finished goods including made-up textiles. Imports of such goodsindeed have been increasing for some time past. It is recommended that a closecheck be kept upon these imports henceforward so that appropriate action can betaken when necessary.7. The recommendation that importers be allowed freedom to use importlicences to bring in goods from any country could not, and of course should not,interfere with limitations of imports from certain countries, as for example, Japan,on whose goods special limitations now exist and may exist in the future, forbalance of payments or other reasons. In the event that existing special limitationsshould be varied, the overall limitation would still apply.8. It is necessary to point out that the excess flow of imports of grey clothmight assume extremely large proportions in the forthcoming months if action bythe Government is delayed. This is a danger which is, for example, inherent in thelow prices of Indian cotton cloth, for which the raw cotton arrangements in india are mainly responsible, and in the existing and potential volume of ordering byimporters. The position might, in fact, become so overwhelmingly critical that itwould be necessary, as a matter of urgency, to impose initially a particularlystringent measure of control. For instance, it might be found expedient to bringunder quota control deliveries under existing orders and to delay the issue of licences until these orders, had substantially been cleared. Regard would be hadin this way to the principle of the sanctity of contracts.9. It is recognised that as regards imports for the improvement trade and subsequent re-export, considerations arise of a somewhat different character. It isnot recommended in any quarter of the cotton industry that there should beinterference with the importation of grey cloth from overseas which creates exporttrade which could not. in fact, be secured on cloth of United Kingdom origin,either for the reason that there was not available a sufficient volume of UnitedKingdom cloth of suitable types or for the reason that on grounds of price thebusiness would otherwise go to exporters and finishers in some other country. Onthe other hand, it is necessary to contemplate the contingency that, by reason ofexceedingly low prices, resulting from raw cotton arrangements or lower wagestandards, imports of grey cloth for the improvement trade might rise to such high levels as to replace a large volume of demand which could otherwise be satisfied by cloth spun, woven and finished in United Kingdom.47813 b 2
ANNEX BCOTTON GOODS IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOMSUMMARY OF CASE FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONMemorandum from the Cotton Board1. The action which the cotton industry asks the Government to take forthe reasons set out later in this paper has been described in detailed recommenda-tions submitted to the President of the Board of Trade. The essential featuresare:  (i) Quota restrictions immediately to limit importations of grey cloth andyarn for consumption in the home market to a rate not exceeding theaverage of the three past years, 1952-54.(ii) At earliest moment appropriate in the light of the negotiating position,freedom to be secured for United Kingdom to impose import tariffs,subject to preferences, on cotton goods from Commonwealth countries.2. The case for the action asked for lies in the recent rapid growth of importsof cotton goodsj particularly from India and Hong Kong. These imports aredisplacing United Kingdom production, are undermining confidence and affectingemployment. If measures are not taken to curb their flow they will quickly inflictdamage upon the industry which it will become increasingly difficult if not impossible to repair.3.   The comparative figures of importance for the years 1950-54 are:  Cotton Cloth (Million Square Yards)	1950	1951	1952	1953	1954Home production       ...      ...	2,230	2,310	1,780	1,960	2,090Total imports    .........	287	376	180	99	267Of which imports from India					and Hong Kong......	81	126	13	18	153Total exports    ...      ......	822	864	711	709	637Of which re-exports   ...	184	184	152	72	87Balance available at home	1,690	1,820	1,250	1,350	1,720Cotton Yarn-		-(Million lbs)			Total imports    ...      ......	14-5	31-7	7-3	3-4	10-note.^-In the last quarter of 1954 imports from India and Hong Kong increased to a rate of184 million square yards a year and have continued to show a rising trend so far in 1955.4. During the last three months the number of operatives at work in theindustry has fallen by 8,000.  Undef-employment is very extensive in all sections.In 1950 and 1951 the high level of imports aroused little anxiety because world demand then exceeded supply and spinners and weavers had long order books-30 and 32 weeks respectively. Circumstances to-day are completely different.Spinners now have an order book averaging 1\ weeks, while weavers have onenominally averaging 14 weeks&apos; production, but actually including substantial quantities of cloth already woven and placed in stock, but not delivered. Theseorder books are dangerously near the minimum necessary to maintain the floW ofproduction.5. The consequences of the rise in imports have been aggravated by a fallin exports.  Competition in the United Kingdom&apos;s overseas markets mainly fromSince such a substitution would undoubtedly cause serious injury to producers of domestic yarn and cloth, it is recommended that the policy of theBritish Government should be to institute a system of check by means of import licensing. If the figures of such imports subsequently revealed developments of grave danger to such producers it would then be necessary to take appropriate action to arrest the trend.
\India and Japan is primarily responsible for this decline. India, therefore, is notonly one of the principal causes of the difficulties which have arisen in the UnitedKingdom domestic market, but also of the shrinkage which has taken place inthe export trade.6. Since the war great and successful efforts have been made by the majorityof United Kingdom cotton mills to raise their level of efficiency. Nothing, however,that the industry can itself do will enable it to compete with India and Hong Kongin the classes of goods which those countries produce. Both have inexhaustiblesupplies of cheap labour. Both enjoy duty free and limitless entry for their goodsinto the United Kingdom the only major country in the world with a cottontextile industry of its own which offers such inviting opportunities.Because they enter free, a large proportion, over 50 per cent., of imports from india and Hong Kong are retained in the home market.7. In addition, India has an advantage which is itself quite decisive. she has instituted arrangements for the control of raw cotton which give her cotton textiles producers access to raw cotton at a price of about Is. Qd. per lb. less thanthat paid by United Kingdom producers. In terms of cloth this represents some3d. per yard or about 20 per cent, of the total price.8. The United Kingdom cotton industry will spare no effort to recover groundlost in export markets. The Cotton Board is about to survey the position in concert with the Board of Trade to see what action both by Government and industry would be possible and desirable. Recovery in the export field, however, cannotbe achieved quickly and is unlikely to be achieved at all unless the home defencesare secured.9. It is reasonable to assume that the country must have a cotton industrycapable in an emergency of meeting the clothing needs of the forces and of thepeople at home and at the same time able to satisfy the diverse requirements ofall the industries producing the weapons of war. The experience of the last warand the efforts of various Ministries of Government and of the industry itselfto undo the consequences of concentration showed how difficult it is to reverse a process of contraction.10. It is vital in the highest degree for the retention and continued recruitment of the labour force and for the maintenance of investment in modernisation to restore confidence that the industry will be retained in being at around its presentsize in terms of output. The industry&apos;s anxiety is to see measures taken now tosafeguard its position before irreparable damage is suffered.
