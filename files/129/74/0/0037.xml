secret. (55) 8726th March, 1955CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn 24th February, the Cabinet appointed a Committee composedof the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Works and the Attorney-General,under my Chairmanship, to report on the practicability of accommodatingthe Colonial Office in the proposed new building in Richmond Terrace, andon the implications of a scheme for a greater Parliament Square (C.C, (55) 18thConclusions, Minute 6).Richmond Terrace2. It would be practicable to erect a new Colonial Office on thissite to accommodate virtually the whole of the headquarters staff of theDepartment, with provision for certain special accommodatiori that theColonial Office requires.    But this would result in a further delay of about two years, since a new building on the Richmond Terrace site would not beready for occupation until some time in 1960,    This further delay would be most undesirable from the point of view of the Colonial Office.Greater Parliament Square3. If the Government decided to work towards a greater parliament square, or even to leave open this possibility, it would be difficult to avoidan early disclosure of this intention.    The decision to use the Richmond ,Terrace site for the new Colonial Office would be bound to become public,and the Government would be asked what use they proposed to make of the westminster Hospital site.    As soon as this was disclosed, it would benecessary to introduce legislation to give the Government power to hold thissite and convert it into an open space, since under present legislation it is held specifically for the provision of Government offices and for no other purpose.    It is difficult to see how the Government could reasonably avoidintroducing at the same time all the legislation necessary to implement thefull plans for a greater Parliament Square.    What this legislation wouldinvolve is considered in paragraphs 4-7.4. A special difficulty would immediately arise in connection withthe building in Great George Street occupied by the Chartered Surveyors,who propose to rebuild their premises and are about to consult the RoyalFine Art Commission about the scale of the proposed building.    It wouldbe wrong to allow the Surveyors to engage in work and incur expenditurewithout the Governments intentions being made clearj and once thiswas done, the Government could not decently refuse to acquire thesepremises as soon as the Surveyors wanted to dispose of them.    Even if-1-COPY NO.  ho
2.44it were possible to acquire them by negotiation, legislation would benecessary to enable the Minister of Works to hold the site, as he could not properly use his existing powers to acquire property for the government service, if the real purpose of the acquisition was to enable the siteeventually to be cleared.    This legislation would also have to includepowers of compulsory purchase, for use if the Surveyors declined to release their premises voluntarily.5. It would, moreover, be difficult to limit this legislation to the chartered surveyors premises only.    The other buildings in question arethe Middlesex Guildhall, and the offices of the Middlesex County Counciland the Civil Engineers Institution in Great George Street.    The owners and occupiers of these buildings could reasonably expect the Governmentto take over their premises at any time, and the Government would haveto be ready to do so.    This again Would require legislation, which wouldhave to include powers of compulsory purchase.    So far as is known thereis no precedent for the Government taking powers to acquire buildings atsome indefinite date in the future; and even if there were such action woulddepreciate the value of the property in the hands of the present owners, andwould be a serious encroachment on the liberty of the subject and therights of property.6. If the whole of the site for a greater Parliament Square werecleared, it would also be desirable to acquire additional properties on thewest site of Frinces Street (Storeyls Gate) to enable that side of the Squareto be rebuilt to a more worthy design.    The need for legislation with compulsory purchase powers would similarly arise here*7. We therefore think that to build the new Colonial Office On theRichmond Terrace site with a view to working towards a greater parliament square would* in effect, mean that the Government would have to disclosetheir intentions and would at an early date have to introduce legislation,with compulsory purchase powers, to enable all these properties to be acquired, even though it was not the intention to acquire these propertiesor to exercise those powers for some considerable time.    Such legisla-tion would be at least as controversial as is usually the case when questionsof compulsory acquisition arise.    Moreover, the legislation in this case would have to take the form of a hybrid bill or bills, with all that this involves in complications and delay.Financial Considerations8. We assume that financial considerations would make it undesirable to go ahead with a greater Parliament Square scheme, as awhole, immediately.    The cost of acquiring and demolishing the MiddlesexGuildhall, and the premises occupied by the Chartered Surveyors, theMiddlesex County Council and the Institution of Civil Engineers, has been estimated at about  4&quot;! millions.    There would be additional expenditureon making good the Westminster Hospital site and on laying out thegreater Parliament Square.Other Considerations9. Some of the premises in question are solid and valuablebuildings, the destruction of which might arouse considerable public criticism.    Moreover, the progress of the scheme would in some stagesbe aesthetically unattractive.    If the buildings in Great George Streetwere not to be demolished for some years, their backs would be an eyesorewhatever we did to try and hide them.
H,C.Gwydyr House, S. W. 1.21st March, 1955.10. Our general conclusion accordingly is that there are strong political objections to a scheme for a greater Parliament Square, arisingpartly out of the need to secure comprehensive legal powers, includingcompulsory purchase powers to be exercised at an indefinite future date,and partly out of the large expenditure that would be involved.    Weconsider that the proper course is to proceed with the present plan ofbuilding the new Colonial Office on the Westminster Hospital site.
