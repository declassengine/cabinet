CONFIDENTIALCo(55) 679th March, 1955BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION;REVENUE AND charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation-tionI have circulated to-day copies of the British transport commission^ draft Railway Merchandise Charges Scheme and my viewof the attitude I should adopt towards the scheme (Cc (55) 66)D2Q The scheme will be examined by the Transport Tribunal at great length in view of the large number of interests likely to be represented;,It is not expected that the scheme as finally settled by the Tribunal will bebrought into effect before early next yeare30 In the meantime, the financial position of the Commission hasbecome increasingly difficult, particularly in view of the recent wagessettlements    Since the beginning of 1954, the annual railway bill hasincreased by  30o5 millions for wages,  1.5 millions for National insurance contributions ,  3e 5 millions for coal and  1.5 millions for depreciation(mainly replacement of rolling stock at higher prices)  - a total of 37 millions.    Central charges have increased by  10 5 millions due mainly to additional borrowings, and the Commission consider it prudent to budget for an increase in maintenance of  14 millions,,    This is largely due to increased prices and to a change in practice from a standardmaintenance charge to one based on actual expenditure,,    All this totals 52f millions.    On this basis, and after allowing for economies alreadyeffected and for certain estimated variations in traffics, the Commissionestimate that in a future year there will be an operating deficit on therailways of  10 millions, and that the Commission^ total net receiptswill be  51 millions short of the amount required to meet central charges,,40 The Commission are making a further intensive drive foreconomies and hope that further special economies of the order of ,15 millions a year will be achieved in the future year without reducingstandards of service.    The Comnaission have, however, come to theconclusion that there is no alternative but to raise a number of its charges,,5. The Commission have therefore sought my authority underSection 82 of the Transport Act, 1947, for the following increases, (since there are as yet no Charges Schemes approved by the Transport Tribunalin respect of these charges).COPY NO.CABINET

The Commission also seek to make increases in charges whichare not subject to my control and which I could prevent only if I wereprepared to give a Direction under Section (4) of the Transport Act, 1947bAny such Direction must be of a general character and must be in relationto matters v/hich affect the national interest.    These increases would beeffected as shown in the following paragraphs.7, The Commission propose to increase ordinary fares on main linerailways by l\ per cent.    The Commission already have power to do thisunder the Passenger Charges Scheme approved by the Transport Tribunalin 1954.    (The authorised maximum is 2d0 per mile and the present charge is a ifd0 )0    This would yield  2. 8 millions.8. The Commission also propose to make application to the transport tribunal for the following increases.IncreaseMain Line RailwaysLondon Lines ofBritish RailwaysSeasons 2/6d0 per month. early morning returns -Id. , 2d, , or 3d0ld0 on ordinaryfares of 7d,and overSeasons 2/6d. per month.   early morning returns -Id., 2d., or 3d.Estimated Annual Yield  millions0.31.london transport as for London Linesof British Railways207 4. 0 millions
This application will be under the special quick procedure of Section 23of the Transport Act9 1953, and will be heard in private,,    Any increasesauthorised by the Tribunal may be put into force at once but will requireto be justified at a subsequent public hearing,,    My colleagues will remembethat this procedure was provided in the 1953 Act, specifically to meet suchan occasion as the present,,    A large wages award was quoted in debate asan obvious example.90 Finally the Commission propose(a) To make increases in charges on British Road Services toproduce about  1 million a year for which they require no authority, sincelike all other hauliers they are free to adjust their charges as they thinkfitj     and(b) that the bus companies which they own shall apply to the licensing Authorities for permission to increase charges to bring in 10 5 millions annually.10o        The total increased annual revenue to be obtained from theseproposals is  27 millions.110        Even with the  15 millions from economies and this  27 millions from increased charges, the Commission would, on the basis of its estimatestill be running into deficit at the rate of at least  9 millions a year before taking into account the proposed new rise in coal prices.12.        The Commission wish to hold as soon as possible a press conference at which to say that they have deposited the draft RailwayMerchandise Charges Scheme, to announce the decisions for increasingfares and to add that an application has been made for my authority toincrease railway freight, dock and canal charges.13.        These proposed increases are serious and will, of course, be highly unpopular.    They flow, however, from the wages settlement andother increased and increasing costs and are in my judgement the leastthat must be done if the Commission, in the absence of subsidy, are not tobecome hopelessly insolvent.14.        I seek authority to tell the Commission that they may proceed tohold a press conference on 30th March on the lines indicated above,    Ipropose also subject to the agreement of my colleagues to refer theapplication for charges set out in paragraph 5 to the Permanent Membersof the Transport Tribunal, acting as a Consultative Committee, for their advice as provided in Section 82 of the 1947 Act,J.A.B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,  W. 1.8th March, 1955,
