INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEThere are set out below the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on two recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference at its36th Session in 1953 and on two&apos;Conventions adopted by the Conference at its 31st Session in 1948. It is proposed to communicate these decisions tothe Director-General of the International Labour Office. The texts of theRecommendations were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 9023 and the texts of the Conventions in Cmd. 7638. A statement is also made below concerning ,the rectification of a declaration of acceptance on behalf of the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia of a Convention adopted by the Conference at its30th Session in 1947.Recommendation (No. 96) Concerning the Minimum Age of Admission toWork Underground in Coal MinesThis Recommendation provides that young persons under 16 years of ageshould not be employed underground in coal mines. In the United Kingdomboys under 16 may at present be employed below ground in coal mines.Under Section 124 (2) of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, however, theMinister of Fuel and Power may appoint a day after which no boy under 16may be so employed except for the purpose of such training as the minister may by regulation prescribe. The Minister of Fuel and Power intends underthe provisions of the Act to make an Order the effect of which will be that from 1st luly, 1957, no boy under the age of 16 may be employed underground,and after consultation with both sides of the industry, to make regulationsprescribing the underground training which may be permitted for boys under 16.The Recommendation also provides that young persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years should not be employed underground in coal mines except (a) for purposes of apprenticeship or other systematic vocational training under adequate supervision by competent and experienced persons,or(b) under conditions determined by the competent authority, after con-sultation with the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concernedrelating to the places of work and the occupations permitted and themeasures of systematic medical and safety supervision to be applied.The law and practice in the United Kingdom are in general in conformitywith alternative (b) of this provision except that the places of work permittedare not directly prescribed by the Government. Nevertheless, doctors whoexamine young persons under Government regulations do not pass them asfit for underground work unless they are judged fit to undertake any workwhich they are likely to be called upon to perform during the early years oftheir employment. This system, in the opinion of the Government, providesin effect all necessary safeguards in relation to the places of work in which individual male young persons are employed, and no change is proposed.The Government propose to give effect to the Recommendation to theextent indicated in the preceding paragraphs.,    I 7
Recommendation (No. 97) Concerning the Protection of the Health of Workersin Places of employment the substantive provisions of the Recommendation are in four parts. Thefirst of these deals with technical measures for the control of health risks.The second calls for medical examinations for workers employed in occupationsinvolving special risks to their health. The third makes provision for the notification of cases and suspected cases of occupational disease, and thefourth for first aid facilities.In the field of industrial employment in which the majority of health risksare encountered, the law and practice in the United Kingdom are, in general,in conformity with the provisions of the Recommendation. There are,however, certain of the detailed requirements of the Recommendation whichare not covered by existing legislation and in respect of which the government do not consider legislation practicable or necessary.Paragraph 2 of the Recommendation calls for measures by employers to eliminate or reduce harmful noise or vibrations. This principle is acceptablebut the Government do not consider it practicable to legislate in the present state of knowledge on the subject and are therefore unable to accept an obligation to ensure the application by employers of this particular provision.Paragraph 13 of the Recommendation stipulates that workers who are medically examined under the provisions of the Recommendation should not thereby be involved in expense. It also makes provision designed to protect the workers from deductions from wages due to time lost in attending for medical exami-nation. In the United Kingdom the Factories Acts and Regulations madeunder the Coal Mines Acts require the employer to pay the fees for compulsorymedical examinations required and the Acts and Regulations are designed toensure that as far as reasonably practicable the examinations are carried out at or near to the place of work so as to avoid any loss to the worker. TheGovernment consider that this is the most practical approach to the question and that further legislation is not necessary. Paragraphs 14-17 of theRecommendation deal with the notification of occupational diseases. TheGovernment agree with the principle enunciated in the Recommendation thatthe authority concerned with the protection of the health of workers shouldhave information concerning the occurrence of cases of occupational disease and arrangements to this end are already in operation in the industrial field.The methods used do not, however, conform in certain respects with the detailed stipulations of the Recommendation. The Government consider thatthese arrangements, which have been well tried, are working satisfactorily andthey do not propose to amend them in order to secure exact conformity withthe Recommendation.In addition to the foregoing reservations, the Government consider itnecessary for the time being to make a general reservation with regard to theapplication of the Recommendation to non-industrial employment. Legislationaffecting the protection of the health of workers in such employment is atpresent limited both as regards its nature and its scope, and is not entirely inconformity with the terms of the Recommendation. The question of intro-ducing more comprehensive legislation covering a wide field of non-industrial employment in Great Britain is under consideration and preparations for such legislation, including consultations with the interests concerned, are well advanced. The provisions of the Recommendation are being taken intoaccount in framing this legislation but in advance of. the legislation it is notpossible to say exactly how far it will give effect to them.Subject to these reservations the Government regard the recommendation as generally acceptable.
Convention (No. 89) Concerning Night Work of Women employed in Industry(Revised), 1948Convention (No. 90) Concerning the Night Work of Young Persons employedin Industry (Revised), 1948These Conventions restrict the employment of women and young persons in industrial undertakings during the night. They revise two earlier Conventions,No. 41 applying to women, and No. 6 to young persons.Existing permanent legislation in the United Kingdom conforms to Con-vention 89. Emergency legislation, however, at present permits some relaxation in special circumstances.The permanent legislation in the United Kingdom concerning the hours ofemployment of young persons in industry other than coalmining* accordslargely with the requirements of Convention 90, but it is in some cases slightly less restrictive in regard to the length of the night period and intervals pre-scribed and to the particular circumstances in which male young persons whohave attained the age of 16 years may be employed at night in certain industries.In addition, under emergency legislation, a limited number of such male youngpersons are allowed to he employed at night on certain work which is not specifically provided for in the permanent legislation.Substantial progress has been made in reducing the employment of women and young persons at night and it is the policy of the Government to authoriseit under emergency legislation only in very exceptional cases where the workcannot be done by other means and where the nature and importance of thework is such that, in the national interest, it is imperative that it should beallowed. Such night work is now authorised in fewer than 150 factories.While the need for these more flexible hours of employment continues theGovernment is not in a position to take a final decision concerning the ratifi-cation of Convention 89 or Convention 90.Convention (No. 83) Concerning the Application of International labour standards to Non-Metropolitan territories the ratification of this Convention by the United Kingdom was registeredon 27th March, 1950, but the Convention has not yet come into force.   Itconcerns the application of international labour standards to non-metropolitan territories and contains in a schedule thirteen existing International labour conventions.   A White Paper, Cmd. 7865, stating that the government proposed to ratify this Convention gave the terms of the declarations whichit was proposed to transmit to the Director-General of the International LabourOffice showing the extent to which the various provisions would be applied inthe different non-metropolitan territories.   The declaration made with theagreement of the Government of Southern Rhodesia regarding Convention 83on page 11 of the White Paper omitted to include a modification of Article 2 rtlof the Minimum Age (Industry) Convention (Revised), 1937^-in its application / )to Southern Rhodesia, namely, that the Convention would be applied subjectto the modification of &quot; fifteen years &quot; to &quot; twelve years &quot; in that Article.   The^        .   , necessary ratificationl\ of the original declaration which accompanied the If^^f (instrument of ratification has now been made, and the rectified text of the *      &apos;W&quot;ndeclaration has been formally recorded by the Director-General of theInternational Labour Office.* In coalmining boys between 16 and 18 years of age are still allowed to work at night.The Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, which has received the Royal Assent but has not yetcome into operation brings the law in Great Britain relating to night work by young personsin all mines and quarries into conformity with Convention 90, except for a special exemption for coalmining in three counties where night work by boys between 16 and 18 may continue until a day appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power; the Minister is required to appoint a day not later than five years after the coming into operation of the Act.(30848)   Wt. 1560-9773   101   3/55  D.L.ii
