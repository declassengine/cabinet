C0(55) 66 COPY NO,    b k&apos;9th March, 1955CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONsRAILWAY MERCHANDISE charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationAnnexed is a copy of the British Transport Commission^ DraftRailway Merchandise Charges Scheme and of a memorandum prepared bythe Commission,,    The Commission have discussed the draft schemeconfidentially with interested bodies02. The Transport Act, 1953, contained provisions designed to givethe Commission much greater freedom in charging,,    In particular, these provisions altered the scope and nature of the Commission^ chargesschemes which, in future, are to regulate maximum charges only,3. The present system of railway merchandise charges was feamedto fit conditions in which the railways had a substantial monopoly,.    Thedraft scheme, which is designed to meet conditions of intense competition,proposes substantial changes of principle,,    I think it is likely that thedraft scheme will be strenuously opposed, not only by those who object tothe proposed changes but also by those who seek other changes in their ownfavour,,    As the prescribed charges are maximum charges they will lookhigh04. The Transport Act, 1947, requires that, when the draft scheme has been submitted to the Tribunal, it shall be published by the Commissiontogether with a notice specifying the time and manner in which, objectionsmay be lodged with the Tribunal by bodies representing users and other forms of transporta    The Tribunal must then hold  . public inquiry at which such bodies may be heard.    When the Tribunal has confirmed the scheme,with or without modifications, it will come into force on such date as theTribunal may specify.    The Tribunal is an independent judicial body andthe scheme will not require my approval or the approval of Parliament.5. I have inherited a right, given by the Railways Act, 1921, tobe represented and heard at any proceedings before the Tribunal.    Theexercise of this right has, however, been much affected by the change in theposition of the railways from profit earning companies to a nationalisedundertaking, and by the powers given to me, particularly by section 4 of theTransport Act, 1947, to give directions to the Commission in matters which appear to me to affect the national interest.    It was under this section thatthe Direction in regard to passenger fares was given in 1952, after a passanger charges scheme had been confirmed by the Tribunal, in relationto the exercise by the Commission of a discretion allowed by the scheme,The existence of these powers makes it undesirable, in my view, that I(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL
should be formally represented at the Tribunals hearing.    If I were represented without intervening and it later became necessary to issue a direction, I might be criticised for not making the Governments position clear at the hearing,,    On the other hand,, if I intervened at the hearing,I might if successful be accused of unduly influencing the Tribunal^ whileif unsuccessful I might be placed in an embarrassing position v/ith respectto the giving of directionsQ    It seems to me that the right course is to await the outcome of the proceedings including the evidence and argumentsbefore the Tribunal, the terms of the Tribunals decision and the action proposed to be taken under it by the Commission,,60 I propose, therefore, not to be represented before the tribunal and to let the statutory procedure operate without any intervention on mypart0    I shall, of course, follow the Tribunals proceedings closely andshall bring to the notice of my colleagues any developments which might seem to require actionQJoA0B-C0Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W, 1,8th March, 1955,

^ THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION (RAILWAY MERCHANDISE)* CHARGES SCHEME.INFORMATORY memorandum I. The British Transport Commission have submitted to the Transport Tribunal for confirmationa draft of a Charges Scheme for the carriage of merchandise by railway. This has been done inpursuance of Section 76 of the Transport Act, 1947, as amended by Section 20 of the Transport Act,1953. The Scheme has been discussed with representative bodies of rail users and other interested parties.2. The Scheme deals with charges and terms and conditions of carriage for all merchandise and livestock traffic by goods or passenger train service, except passengers&apos; luggage, and has been preparedagainst the background of the Transport Act, 1953, which has effected profound changes in the practical and legal position of railway merchandise charges with the object of enabling the railways to competeeffectively with road transport.3. The railways are already faced with intensified competition from road haulage consequent uponthe removal as from January 1st, 1955, of certain restrictions on the operations of independent roadhauliers in the long distance field.4. Some of the statutory obligations controlling railway charges disappeared with the passingof the Transport Act, 1953, but the full freedom of the railways to compete effectively will not berealised until the remaining statutory controls imposed by the Railways Act, 1921, are repealed uponthe coming into force of the Charges Scheme.5. As required by the Transport Act, 1953, the Scheme does not provide for fixed or standardcharges, but settles the maximum charges which the Commission may make. Where maxima appearnot to be reasonably practicable or to be undesirable, the Scheme authorises the making of reasonablecharges which, in case of dispute, are subject to appeal to the Transport Tribunal.The Scheme, in accordance with the 1953 Act, also makes clear that, subject to the provisions ofthat Act and of the Scheme itself, the charges to be made are to be left to the Commission^ discretionwhich will be exercised commercially.6. In transport, as in any other commercial business, the most effective price protection for theconsumer is competition. It is accepted that there is a field, though a rapidly diminishing one, inwhich the consumer has no reasonable alternative to the use of railway transport. The transport act, 1953, provides for this situation in Section 22, under which traders called upon to pay charges,in those circumstances, which in their opinion are unreasonable or unfair, may complain to theTransport Tribunal, who have power to make an order upon the Commission if they are not satisfiedthat the charge complained of is in all the circumstances fair and reasonable.7. The charges of the Commission^ competitors for freight business are not regulated in anyway. The competition between haulier and haulier produces, according to the vagaries of cost and market, a wide diversity of charges. In contrast, the railway merchandise charges of the commission have been subject to a close and complex system of statutory control. The statutory railway charges are now governed by a classification of commodities mainly according to &quot; value,&quot; with scales of charges for each class, according to distance, on a standard national pattern which ignores the substantial variations in relative cost arising from differences in particular operating circumstances.Rates are only varied to a limited extent to accord with the weight and size of the consignmentoffered and then mainly for the lower grades of traffic.The present system is founded on the broad principle of averaging cost over all the traffic andthe contribution by each traffic towards the total expenses of the undertaking according to its ability to pay. This entails much cross-subsidisation as between one route and another, one transit andanother, or between the regular customers and the casual user. To succeed it needs conditions ofnear monopoly, which no longer exist.   It is quite incompatible with a competitive regime.Competition in transport must have regard to cost, and railway costs, in common with those ofall other forms of transport, are governed by a great variety of operating conditions, such as the weightand loading characteristics of the consignment, the volume and regularity of the traffic, and the volumeand balance of traffic over the particular route. If the Commission are to compete and also to fulfill their statutory duty to pay their way, the present system of charges based upon the averaging of costs on a national scale must be abandoned.
8. The maximum charges in the Scheme for merchandise (including coal and other minerals)carried by goods train (for brevity here referred to as the &quot; new maxima &quot;) are based on new principles and relate to about 85 per cent., in terms of present-day receipts, of the traffics covered by the Scheme.9. The new maxima have been put at a level high enough to cover a substantial range of variation in the charges to be made in practice. The new maxima do not reflect the extremes of cost. Theyare not truly comparable with the present standard charges, which were designed for a differentpurpose, viz., to provide a standard revenue.10. The new maxima are set forth in a series of scales by reference to a combination of two factors,viz. : (a) the weight of the consignment,(fa) the &quot; load ability &quot; of the consignment.load ability, or loading capability, as defined in the Scheme, provides a yardstick by which therelative quantity of any given traffic capable of being loaded into a wagon can be measured. Subjectto this factor, substantially lower maxima are provided for traffic consigned in larger quantities upto 10 tons. By use of the formula, the maximum charge appropriate to any given consignment canbe determined.The load ability of a commodity is a variable factor which cannot be expressed with any precisionin a statutory classification. In a scheme of maximum charges based upon the weight and loadabilityof the consignment, it is not practicable to distinguish between traffics, as now classified by othercriteria, e.g., raw materials and finished products, in determining maximum charges.II. The general relativity of the new maxima is an expression of the principle of comparativecost. Within the new maxima, the Commission will be able to pursue a policy of rate-making whichwill encourage the tendering of traffic in wagon-load consignments.12. The relatively high cost of handling and documentation in the case of the smaller consign-ments justifies some additional charge. Consequently, the new maxima include flat additional charges in respect of consignments under I ton.!3. The new maxima are all expressed in the same general form, viz., a charge per ton for thefirst 10 miles (which includes terminal accommodation and services) and an additional charge per tonper mile thereafter. In the Scheme, terminal charges are not separated from conveyance charges.There is no place for this in a maximum Charges Scheme because the services performed at stations and their comparative costs vary too much for them to be separately identified.The method of construction of the scales is again a reflection of comparative cost and has theimportant result of giving a pronounced taper in the resulting charge per ton per mile. The relativeadvantage in the new maxima as the distance increases is greater than in the present standard charges.14. The new maxima are on a &quot; Station to Station &quot; basis, but collection and delivery service will be available for many traffics, as now, at reasonable charges.15. In the case of livestock by goods train and merchandise, miscellaneous traffic and livestockby passenger train, the Scheme provides for the adoption of the standard charges at present in force(including authorised increases) as maximum charges.The existing Standard Terms and Conditions of Carriage settled by the Transport Tribunalunder the Railways Act, 1921, and the Commission^ right to agree with a trader special terms andconditions of carriage are continued by the Scheme. It is also proposed that in calculating the maximumcharge for the carriage of any particular consignment of merchandise the present chargeable distancesrecorded at the stations shall be used.It may be found necessary to submit to the Transport Tribunal further proposals in regard tothese matters at a later date. These proposals will be submitted as amending Schemes under theprovisions of the Transport Acts.16.  The Scheme is directed solely to providing a new structure of railway freight charges.It is no part of the object of the Scheme to bring about a general increase of charges to meetincreases of cost. The Transport Act, 1947, provided separate transitional machinery for thispurpose pending the approval of a Charges Scheme.17. Once the Scheme is approved by the Tribunal, it is the intention of the Commission that mostof the rates in active use at the time the Scheme comes into force should continue in operation forthe time being to enable a progressive and systematic review of all such rates to be made. In carryingout this review, the Commission will adjust charges, either upwards or downwards, as part of a processof evolving a new and flexible charging system based upon sound business principles. It is the Corn-mission^ intention to consult with representative bodies of Traders in the development of theirsystem of charges within the authority of the Scheme.Although under the Transport Act, 1953, there can be no legal obligation upon the Commissionto publish any charges save the maxima, the Commission may be expected, as a commercial undertaking,to provide a &quot; price list,&quot; the contents of which will be made known to interested traders.March, 1955
