Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1955Copy No. 62CABINETNos. 10, 11 AND 12, DOWNING STREETMemorandum by the Minister of Works       ^The houses in Downing Street were put up by Sir George Downing aboutthe year 1686. There have been many alterations and additions, including work by Kent in 1734 and Sir John Soane in 1825. No. 12 was burnt in 1879 and onlythe basement and ground floor remain.2. Surveys were carried out at No. 10 during the summer recess and atNos. 11 and 12 during the Christmas recess. Extensive damage has been reported.As was usual in Sir George Downing&apos;s day when building on difficult subsoils,the foundations of the houses were partly laid on timber cross-beams. These haverotted and there has been irregular subsidence. Much cracking of the brickworkhas resulted and many of the walls are out of plumb. The Downing Street front of No. 10 leans 1\&quot; from the vertical (as compared with 4&quot; in 1921) and in thegarden front there is a bulge apparent to the naked eye. The Downing Streetfront of No. 11 is also out of plumb, but unevenly so, and is insufficiently securedto the cross-walls. There is also dry rot in the timbers of the houses and wood-boring beetles have been at work.3. It is probable, though not certain, that things can be left as they are for another five years without grave risk of major damage or of collapse. On theother hand, the longer we leave things the more difficult and expensive restorationwill be. The lift at No. 10 is a worry. It is old, it requires constant attention andit may easily break down. The brickwork in the lift shaft is cracked and I am advised that if we tried to put in a new lift it is probable that the shaft would cave in.4. Reconstruction will be a big job. The walls of Nos. 10 and 11 needunderpinning and many of the floors and window lintels will have to be strengthenedor replaced. The front wall of No. 11 will almost certainly have to be taken downand rebuilt and much work will have to be done on No. 12 even if it is left as a one-storey building.5. It would be more straightforward to pull down all the houses and put upmodern buildings. We could certainly get more accommodation if we did. Butthe houses in Downing Street are deeply embedded in our history. To destroythem would be an act of impiety.Suggested Plan6. I therefore suggest that we should proceed in accordance with the followingplan:  (a) The external appearance of the houses, other than No. 12, remains thesame.(b) Rebuild No. 12 to its original height.(c) Keep the Cabinet Room and its surroundings and the State Rooms inNo. 10 virtually unchanged.47838SECRETC. (55) 8428th March, 1955
(d) Make a good modern flat with a view over St. James&apos;s Park for theChancellor of the Exchequer in a rebuilt No. 12.(e) Turn No. 11 and any spare space in No. 12 into replanned and up-to-dateoffices for the Chancellor, the Whips and the No. 10 staff.   The presentstaff accommodation in No. 10 is below standard.(/) Replan the living accommodation in No. 10 on the present scale but on more convenient and up-to-date lines.7. This plan might cost about  300,000 and be finished about two years afterthe work started. These are guesses. It is much more difficult to time and costreconstruction work than new work.Alternative Accommodation for the Prime Minister8. A house must be found for the Prime Minister while the work is going on.   The essentials are:  (a) A suitable Cabinet Room.(b) Good rooms for entertaining and for living.(c) Enough office room for the No. 10 staff in or adjoining the house.(d) It must be near enough to the House of Commons to be within easydivision bell range.Only Admiralty House meets all the requirements.Timing9. There are a number of factors to be taken into account in the timing ofthis operation. The suggestions I have made involve much work. Planning willtake some time. We are about to start war damage repairs at the Admiralty whichwill take two years to complete. We hope to be able to keep Downing Street goingat least until the work at the Admiralty has reached the stage when there will bethe minimum of disturbance to the occupant of Admiralty House: we expect this to be about October, 1956.   Meanwhile, we must keep a close watch on No. 10.10. If these plans are approved, we also intend to rebuild at the same time asDowning Street part of the old Treasury, which suffered war damage. This willavoid subsequent disturbance to the Prime Minister and the other occupants ofDowning Street.-Informing the Opposition11. When a decision has been reached it would be an act of grace to informthe Leader of the Opposition.\Summary .12.   To summarise:  (a) Nos, 10, 11 and 12, Downing Street, need major reconstruction;(b) reconstruction should be carried out in accordance with the proposals inparagraph 6 above;(c) Admiralty House should be prepared as an alternative residence for thePrime Minister;(d) the progress of war damage repairs at the Admiralty should permit thePrime Ministers occupation of Admiralty House by about October,1956, if necessary;(e) the Leader of the Opposition should be informed of what is proposed.N. B.Ministry of Works, S.E. J,24th March, 1955.
