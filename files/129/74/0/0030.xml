secret.(55) 8022nd March, 1955CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Attorney-general in- C, (55) 78 the Minister of Transport makes it clear that thepoint foi* decision is whether he should exercise his powers of giving ageneral direction to the Transport Commission in the national interest.In deciding this question my colleagues will no doubt wish to consider theextent to which it is open to the Minister under the Transport Act, 1947to give such a direction to the Commission.2. The Minister has not in my opinion power under Section 4(1)of the Transport Act, 1947 to give a direction which will relieve theCommission of the duty so to conduct their undertaking as to secure thattheir income is sufficient to meet their expenditure taking one year with another.3. The Minister could validly give a direction to delay theintroduction of increased fares or to prohibit their introduction if in hisopinion the national interest would be adversely affected and if such a direction would not necessarily result in a breach by the Commission ofthe duty imposed by Section 3(4).E,g.      (1)  If it was established that the directionmeant that the duty imposed by Section 3(4)could not be discharged, the direction v/ould be invalid.(2)  If, on the other hand, the burden of increased costs could be met by economies,the elimination of redundancy, increased efficiency, etc. , a direction prohibiting anincrease of fares would not be invalid.4. Before making a direction under Section 4(1), the Ministermust consult the Commission.    If the Commission established that a breach of their duty must necessarily result, he would not presumablymake the direction.    If they failed to establish that, and he made thedirection, the legality of his action could be challenged in the courts and in view of the presumption &quot;omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta&quot; the onus would lie on the challenger of establishing that a breach of duty would necessarily result.R.E.M.-B.COPY NO.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.
