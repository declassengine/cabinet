Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1955SECRET CoPy No-C. (55) 8828th March, 1955CABINETCOTTON industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI. -Meeting with the Cotton board in my paper of 19th March (C. (55) 76) I said I would circulate another paper on the subject of the cotton industry after the meeting with the Cotton Board.2. The Prime Minister received them on 24th March. The Chancellor of theExchequer, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Minister of State, Boardof Trade, and I were present.3. The industry&apos;s representatives made their case fully and impressively.In effect they reiterated the recommendations in their memoranda (C. (55) 76,Annexes A and B) except that they made it clear that there is no need to take initialholding action by way of quota against imports from Europe, where the17^ per cent, tariff gives sufficient protection. They supplemented their memoranda by pressing for the complete removal of purchase tax, primarily in order to help the export trade, and emphasised that no half measures in this field would suffice.In this paper I deal with their recommendations regarding restrictions on imports into this country, and describe the action which would be necessary if we decide to meet at least in part their request for protection. In a separate paper (C. (55) 89)I put forward comprehensive proposals regarding our broad textile policy on lines which I would regard as defensible in the event of any action being decided on.II. The Cotton Board proposals. The Cotton Board&apos;s proposals as defined in their memoranda andelucidated at the meeting amount to:  (i) a holding quota on retained imports of grey cotton cloth and cottonyarn from Commonwealth countries, to be followed by:(ii) a tariff on imports of the same Commonwealth goods, subject perhaps to the continuance of some preference as against the most-favoured-nation rate of 17J per cent, (cloth) and 1\ per cent. (yarn).It is important to note that (i) is essentially a mere holding move for (ii), which isthe proposed long-term solution. We must consider the long-term policy and the interim action together. We could impose a quota only if we were prepared to announce what our long-term policy was. Even so, we should need to minimise the inevitable damage to our political and commercial relations with theCommonwealth and other countries by careful explanations to the Governmentsconcerned as well as to our own people.5. To deal first with yarn. In my judgment no case has been made out forquota or tariff action against yarn. The imports complained of are trivial annualimports of 7 million lb. against home production of 850 million and exports of39 million-and come mostly from non-Commonwealth countries. I do not believethat if we restricted imports of Commonwealth cloth they would be replaced bydangerously large imports of yarn; this can only be a hypothetical danger at thisstage and I think therefore that we can dismiss this part of the proposal.6. The question of immediate interim action, therefore, boils down to a holding quota on cotton grey cloth imports from India and Hong Kong. In my judgment this would have to take the form of a quota against all sources at present47849 t.
free both of quota and duty, i.e., the sterling Commonwealth (including theColonies), Eire and Burma. This is partly to avoid charges of discrimination andpartly to prevent obvious possibilities of diversion.7. But India and Hong Kong are the only Commonwealth countries fromwhich the trouble comes. The figures certainly show that there has been a violentupsurge recently in imports of cotton grey cloth from these countries:  Million square yards1952      1953       1954       1955 (Jan.-Feb. asannual rate)India   ......      10-1      15-9      127-9      367-4Hong Kong   ...       1-6       0-7       18-1       48-0Even these figures conceal the fact that a big increase of imports was concentrated in the last months of 1954 and has been carried on into the first two months of 1955.8. I realise the objections to putting a restriction on grey cloth coming to us from Hong Kong. Unlike India, Hong Kong has never put drastic restrictions onour exports. It has suffered from our restrictions on East/West trade. But I donot see how a quota if there is to be an effective one could make an exception for Hong Kong. In the first two months of 1955 the rate of import of grey clothfrom this Colony has nearly trebled to an annual rate of about 50 million yards.Since most of this clcth is retained in this country (as compared with about half ofthe Indian imports) Hong Kong imports are a more serious threat than the figuressuggest. Furthermore, if we were to let Hong Kong remain as a source of quota-free and duty-free imports the logic of the matter is that these imports would increase automatically since additional capacity could and would be broughtrapidly into production to replace the Indian cloth exports to this country. Ifrestrictions are to be imposed in respect of India, 1 have no doubt that any attemptto stave off similar action in respect of Hong Kong could result Only in greaterhardship for her industry in the long run, by reason of the greater investment thatwould have been made there to meet the demand that India was no longer ableto satisfy. I reluctantly conclude therefore that Hong Kong would have to be covered.9. Then there is the question of the level at which a quota would have tobe fixed. The Cotton Board have proposed it should be fixed at the estimated average figure for retained imports from all sources in 1952-54. Their estimateof this is 48 million square yards, while the corresponding figure for retained imports from India and Hong Kong alone is about 30 million square yards. If,instead of the average over three years, we take 1954 alone, imports from Indiaand Hong Kong amounted to 146 million square yards and of this perhaps75 millions were for retention in this country.10. I feel that the only practical course would be to limit future retained imports by import licensing to the level of retained imports for 1954 rather thana more restrictive figure. If we were to set some lower figure than this, the repercussions in India and Hong Kong would be much sharper; the problem ofdealing with existing contracts and irrevocable credits would then.be greater ifnot insoluble; and the pressure would be for a higher rate of permanent tariff.I think that the basis I have suggested would be a fair compromise and I doubt if intheir hearts the Cotton Board expect more.11. Imports for processing and re-export would be licensed freely in additionto the quota.. 12, The practical problems to which the quota would give rise are discussed in an Appendix, Goods in transit and those covered by irrevocable letters of credit would have to be admitted, but we might find that this did not leave room for all existing contracts.III.-The Question for Decision13. It has now become necessary for us to decide whether to meet the CottditBoard&apos;s case Which is, in substance, that the Lancashire textile industry can nolonger manage without protection against duty-free imports of cotton cloth from commonwealth countries.14. The argument irt favour is that it would make a modest contribution towards easing the selling difficulties of the industry. The immediate impositionof a quota would offer them a breakwater against a further rise in imports, andthe longer term arrangements to be negotiated with the Commonwealth
Mmw in &apos; -Governments (which would almost certainly mean a tariff) would afford permanent. protection/ Early action by quota would steady manufacturing and commercial: sentiment in Lancashire, which is badly shaken at the moment..,      15.   The case against can be summarised as follows:  :        ;; (i) A quota would have to lead, as the Cotton Board recognise, to a tariff.A tariff on Commonwealth goods is no doubt a thing which must .bcfaced one of these days. But the first step in this direction wouldcertainly be a grave one.(ii) We,could hardly expect to hold the line at cotton; we should certainlyreceive many consequential requests from other industries for protectionby quota or tariff against both Commonwealth and foreign countries.These industries are watching cotton developments closely and some ofthese requests would be immediate and difficult to resist. The firstobvious example is gloves, where imports from Hong Kong alreadyaccount for a higher proportion of the home market than is the case with cotton cloth imports, and are still rising. It is very difficult to finda logical case for granting protection against the cloth and refusing itagainst the gloves.(iii) the quota necessary under the initial holding operation would be aprotective quota which could not be justified under the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade. Indeed, we took the lead in fighting against such quotas at Geneva. Our action could be represented as beingsharply at variance with our existing economic and trade policy whichaims at outlawing restrictions of this kind. Moreover, our readiness togrant protection to a clamant United Kingdom industry on a case suchas this (which foreigners would regard as weak) would discourage our friends in the Canadian and United States Governments in their efforts to withstand the constant pressure from their own industries for greaterprotection. We are, after all, low-cost exporters to them, and for usto accept the low-cost argument would make it harder for us to assist them in those efforts.(iv) Although by letting in imports from India and Hong Kong up to the 1954level of retained imports, we should leave their exporters with a lot toplay with, this action, since it would lead us inevitably on to a tariff,would involve a re-negotiation of the Indian Trade Agreement. at best, this would mean the loss of some useful preference for India; butit might well lead to the loss of all our preferences in India and a stateof affairs in which India and the United Kingdom each treated the otheras a foreign country in matters of trade. Our total trade with India isitself substantial over  100 millions each way. Such a result wouldhave far-reaching effects on the general financial and economic, and\ indeed political, relationships of the whole Commonwealth and sterling area.i (v) Action against Colonial imports would be difficult to reconcile with our general Colonial policy which has aimed at helping the Colonies inregard to their imports. Here, too, the ultimate effects might be far-reaching in the widest aspects of. our international affairs.16. We should require legislative power to impose import duties on commonwealth goods. In the event of action being decided upon my colleaguesmight consider making suitable provision in this year&apos;s Finance Bill, so avoiding thedifficulties of a special Bill and demonstrating to other countries that the quota isa temporary holding measure.17. I have given much thought to the weighty issues raised by the CottonBoard memorandum. Making a judgment on economic and commercial groundsalone, I consider that action of the kind proposed against Commonwealth clothwould do little good and much harm. I should prefer that we sought a solution tothe problems of the textile industry by other means. I should in any event regardan attempt to deal with these problems solely by the methods described in this paper as a grave error and likely to lead to serious and justifiable public criticism.y - -mi&apos; : :   &apos;:i!v&apos;:-* &apos; &apos; P: T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,.    28th March, 1955. .&quot; &apos;
APPENDIXQUOTA ARRANGEMENTS AND PROBLEMSBasis of the arrangements. The restrictions would be applied to imports of grey cloth wholly or mainly of cotton by amending the existing Open General Licence.- The amendment would be effected by a Statutory Instrument which would not have to be laidbefore Parliament and would not be subject to annulment by Parliamentaryresolution.2. The imports to which the control would apply are those from any country which can at present send us such goods both quota and duty free (i.e., the BritishCommonwealth (except Canada), British Trust Territories, British protectorates and Protected States, Burma, and the Irish Republic). In practice only India and hong Kong would be affected but the restrictions would have to cover other territories to prevent Indian or Hong Kong cloth reaching us free both of quota andduty through those territories.3. The arrangements for imports from other countries, which are subject to duty or quota or both, would remain unchanged.4, All imports of grey cloth from the sources named in paragraph 2 would need a specific licence (with the exception of goods in transit-see below). Theselicences would be in terms of square yards and be valid until 31st December, 1955.5. The object would be to allow imports for re-export after processing tocontinue coming in as freely as before and to keep the rate of imports for the home market during the remainder of 1955 to the same rate as imports for the home market in 1954.The problem of goods in the pipeline6. Although no estimate of the goods in the pipeline is possible, the amountis believed to be substantial. These goods fall into three classes:  (a) Goods in transit from the overseas supplier.  All precedents require that where H.M. Customs are satisfied that goods are in transit at the time a quota restriction is imposed, they should be admitted without licenceand outside the quota.(b) Goods which the importer has ordered before the restrictions were imposedand for which he has to pay under an irrevocable letter of credit.Precedent requires that these goods should be admitted under licenceand outside the quota.(c) Other goods which the importer has, before the restrictions were imposed,ordered or contracted for. Since the import cuts of 1952, these goodshave also been admitted under licence and outside the quota, althoughit has in practice proved difficult to judge whether the contracts werein the normal course of business or merely an attempt to forestall therestrictions in collusion with the overseas supplier.7. The arrangements described above could not be applied to grey cloth for two reasons. First, the proportion of imported grey cloth re-exported afterprocessing is very high and the restrictions, instead of covering imports in general,would be intended to bite solely on cloth for the home market. It follows that anycloth admitted as being in the pipeline would have to be divided into that forre-export and that for retention in the home market. Secondly, the amount ofcloth in the pipeline is unduly high. If licences were issued to cover all goodsordered ((c) above) it is virtually certain that the amount licensed in the rest of1955 would exceed the 1954 rate. Moreover., the distribution of licences betweenimporters would be most inequitable, favouring those who had placed extravagantor unrealistic orders.Methods of licensing to be adopted8. Exports. Importers who undertook to re-export the whole of particularconsignments after processing, would receive import licences outside the quota.They would be required to make returns of their imports against these licences and of the amounts of finished cloth re-exported.
9. Goods in transit or covered by irrevocable credits. All cloth in transitwould be admitted without licence by Customs and all goods covered byirrevocable credits would be admitted under licence. Importers would, however,be required to state whether they would re-export the cloth or put it on the home market. If they were to re-export it, they would be required to make the returnsreferred to at paragraph 8. If not, it would be taken into account in issuing anyfurther licences see paragraph 10.10. Other home trade. The amount of cloth which was destined for thehome market and was admitted as being in transit or covered by irrevocable creditwould be subtracted from the total amount which might be admitted for the home market up till 31st December, 1955. The remainder would be treated as a singlequota available for imports from any of the sources named in paragraph 2.Licences under this quota would be issued to importers in proportion to the importseach one made in 1954 whether for the home or export trade after taking intoaccount in each case the amount he had brought in as gOods in transit or underirrevocable credits. The amount distributed in this way might be very small butto the extent that he received a licence under this arrangement the importer wouldbe able to take up the goods which he had ordered but for which he had notopened an irrevocable, credit.Some difficulties and points traders might criticise11. Traders might feel that the United Kingdom was setting a bad example in not admitting in full all goods ordered (or contracted for). It might also be said-and this is the converse that, in allowing goods covered by irrevocable credits to come in while keeping the total imports screwed down, the arrangements were most inequitable and discriminated against the trader who could not or did not open credits. Again, the need to obtain a licence and make returns would act asa deterrent to the re-export business. Moreover, despite the form filling, somegoods licensed for re-export would probably seep on to the home market.
