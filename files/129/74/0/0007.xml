(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)secret.(55) 57 COPY NO.   4 \23rd February,1955CABINETRATING AND VALUATION BULLMemorandum by the Attorney-general there is a practical (as opposed to political) reason for post-postponing the publication of the valuation lists so as to secure their publica-tion simultaneously with that of the new rate poundage.2a        If the lists are published in October and show, as I understandthey will, very great increases, the objections to the list are likely to bevery numerous.    If the lists are not published until April, it may bethat many of those who would otherwise have objected will not beprepared to incur the expense of doing so when the see that, despite the increased valuation, the amount they have to pay in rates is not materially different.\3.        Thus publication of the valuation lists and the rate poundagesimultaneously will not only reduce the risks of the machine gettingclogged but also save some people expense which they would not have incurred had they known the rate poundage.RoE,M.-B.Law Officers1 Department, W.
