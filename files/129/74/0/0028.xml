(TJtilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)secret,(55) 7821 st March, 1955CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationAs requested by the Cabinet on 1 6th March (CDC.(55) 25thConclusions, Minute 8), I attach a statement giving further details of thefinancial position of the British Transport Commission, which has been,prepared in consultation with them.2. In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion I ought, perhaps, tobring out more clearly than I did in C (55) 67 the question which arises inrespect of the British Transport Commission^ proposed increases in fares.    The point for decision is whether I should exercise my powers ofgiving a general direction in the national interest to prevent them from increasing fares under authority which they already have or may obtain from the Transport Tribunal.    That is the only action on this subject whichit is open to me to take if the Cabinet wish to prevent the commission from making such increases.    I would point out that the procedure for obtaining such authority speedily was provided in our own Transport Act,1953, to deal with precisely the situation which has in fact arisen, that isto say increased costs arising from a large wage increase.    It is, to say the least, extremely doubtful whether I have power to stop the commission from applying to the Tribunal under this procedure.\3. In view of the known financial position of the Commission,and of the sincere attempts which they are making by this and other measuresto improve their position, the issue of a general direction would be a veryserious step to take, and I am sure most unfortunate in its effect.    In theabsence of such a direction I must make clear that I have no power toprevent the Commission from increasing fares under any authority given bythe Tribunal.    And I must also make it clear that I have no doubt that they ought to be allowed so to do, and that their sense of financial responsibility would be seriously undermined by any such action on my part,J.A.B-C.IjMinistry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1. ,19th March, 1955.;opy no. ffjQ

Depreciation(a)    The following table shows the charges actually made for depreciation in arriving at British Railways results as above,together with an estimate of what the charges would have beenhad they been based on current replacement values instead of on book values.Year Depreciation ProvisionsActually If provisioncharged in had been basedAccounts on currentreplacementvalue s m.  m.1948                               12. 8 191949                               13.4 201950                                14.0 221951                               14. 8 241952                               15.6 271953                               16.3 301954                               17.6 31104.5 173&quot;Future&quot; year 18.0 32(b) The Transport Act, 1947, requires that the Commission shall make proper charges to revenue for depreciation or renewal of assets.(c) The above figures relate to rolling stock, vehicles and plant andequipment.    Rates of depreciation are based on the expectedlives of the various types of assets.(d) No charge to Revenue Account is made for depreciation ofpermanent way, tunnels, viaducts, buildings and otherstructures;  only expenditure on maintaining and renewingthese assets is charged.3.   Maintenance(a)       When the Commission began operations in 1948, it was clear that substantial abnormal maintenance expenditure would be incurred as a resultof war-time arrears.    It was not, however feasible to identify physically andto quantify this abnormal expenditure.    Accordingly, the Commissiondecided to make a charge to Revenue Account for maintenance expenditurebased upon the level incurred pre-war, with adjustment for changes in the assets in service and increased to allow for the rise in prices.    This was onmuch the same basis as had been used for the purposes of the government control Agreement during the war.    The excess of actual maintenance expenditure over this &quot;standard&quot; charge has not been borne on Revenue Accountbut has been charged against a provision for abnormal maintenance of
 150 millions which was set up in the Commission^ books at 1st January 1948^largely derived from the monies made available to the vested undertakingsfor this purpose.(b)     A revenue charge based upon pre-war expenditure tends to haveless and less validity as time goes on and it was realised some time agothat steps must be taken to bring the charge to Revenue Account into line with current levels of expenditure.    In the Commission^ 1952 report*t and accounts it was stated that it was intended to discontinue the existing arrange-menis by the end of 1953 and to substitute a procedure under which mainten-ance expenditure would be charged to Revenue Account as incurred, subjectto equalisation arrangements for certain categories of expenditure in orderto avoid abnormally heavy charges in particular years.    There has been no change in basic principles;  an out of date formula has been replaced byone based on current conditions.(c) In the 1953 Report and Accounts it was stated that the existing arrangements in connection with maintenance expenditure were being dis-continued as from 1st January, 1954.    The change was comprehensivelyreviewed and accepted in a memorandum from the Consultative Committeeto the Minister.(d) The Commission are satisfied that they had no option but tomake the changes which have been made in the arrangements for chargingmaintenance expenditure to Revenue Account.    They could not justify totheir auditors the continuation any longer of the old formula which as stated in their Reports for 1952 and 1953 it was their intention to discontinue.Moreover there is no account other than Revenue to which the expenditurein question could properly be charged, and the Abnormal Maintenance account has been reduced to a level which is barely adequate as an opening provisionfor maintenance equalisation.(e) The increase of  14 millions in costs of maintenance over thatmade in December, 1953 on the occasion of the previous application for authority to increase freight charges, is made up of approximately 10 millions due to a change of accountancy formula and approximately 4 millions in increased costs.(f) The Commission are fully satisfied that the charges which theyare making to Revenue Account for maintenance, including depreciation andrenewals, are no more than are adequate.    Indeed, the Commission fear that they may be open to the criticism that they are providing too little,especially having regard to their practice of providing depreciation basedon historic cost without any provision towards the extra costs of replacement at current prices.
