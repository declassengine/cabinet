secret.(55) 648th March, 1955CABINETREVIEW OF THE GENERAL AGPEEMENTON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradThe G.A.T.T. Review ended last week.    Thenegotiations have been ad referendum and Governments are not requiredto state immediately whether they will accept the revised Agrae indent.The Delegations merely signed the texts in order to authenticate them as being the text which commended ihe support of the majority.2. It is certain, however, that we shall immediately be pressed in the House for a statement.    I shall in due course be submittinga paper to my colleagues summarising the results of the negotiations,and I am not now asking for a decision on them.    If, as I shall propose,we agree to recommend the new Agreement to Pa.rliam.eni, we must decidewhen and how to do so.    It- would be helpful to consider this question of timing immediately.3. For the next few weeks - until the text of the Agreementcontaining the proposed amendments is generally available, and until there has been time for Parliament and public opinion to assess theirsignificance - we need not commit ourselves.    It has been agreed atGeneva that there shall be no communique until the texts can be madeavailable in all capitals.    This will be on about 21st March.    I proposethat we should announce that we shall issue a White Paper for the convenience of the House and that there should be no discussion tT^-tilafter the documents are thus generally available.    I hope to be able toissue this White Paper by the same date as the Geneva Communique, orvery soon thereafter.4. There are really two questions about which we have tomake up our minds.    First, should we commend this Agreement toParliament as the best arrangement that can be secured ands secondly passuming that the answer to that question is &quot;yes&quot;, at what stage shouldthe Agreement be signed?5. If we intend to accept this Agreement there are very strong reasons to say so without delay.    The issues are really quite clear.We cannot pretend that we are only now learning the results of thenegotiations and we shall be open to attack if we give the impression thatwe need time to make up our minds.    It will be said that the advantages and disadvantages must be finely balanced if we are so undecided, andthis will encourage the opponents of the Agreement, give them moreopportunity to mobilise opposition and appear to give substance to theircriticismSo    We cannot, I think, avoid a debate and I fear that any debateCOPY NO.

in which the Government did not give a clear lead would leave a definiteimpression that there was not a majority in the House in favour of theAgreement,,    If it appeaz-s at all likely that we might reject the Agreementthis could affect its chances of securing the approval of Congress, and if in fact Congress rejected the Agreement, we might bo told that ourindecision had been an important factor in that result06. It would be possible and indeed right, I think, to reserveour actual signature of the Agreement until the United States Governmenthave put the new Organisational Agreement to Congress0    We could saythat we would not sign the Agreement without reservations,,7. We should also say that before committing ourselvesirrevocably we are consulting other Commonwealth Governments who9like ourselves, will have been considering the result of the negotiationsas a v/hole.    We can make the point that we wish to take th^ir views intoconsideration before signing the Agreement,    But in giving these reasonsfor not finally committing ourselves, it would not in my view be wise tosuggest that we were undecided about the merits of the new Agreement inother respects.8. I recommend to my colleagues thats -(i)if it is decided to accept the revised G0A0T.T0,we should make an early statement accordingly;(ii)we should say that before signature we shallawait the decision of the United States1 congress and consult fully with Commonwealth countries  and(iii)we should at the same time announce our intention to seek powers to impose countervailingand anti-dumping duties.PoT.\Board of Trade, S0W.l07th March, 1955
