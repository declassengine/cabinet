Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955SECRETC. (55) 6028th February, 1955CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerSince the Cabinet discussion of coal prices on 24th February (C.C. (55)18th Conclusions, Minute 1) I have had further consultations with the national coal Board.2. In consequence the Board are now prepared to act entirely on their own responsibility, and after consulting the Consumers&apos; Councils, to make the followingannouncement about the middle of March.&quot;National Coal Board Statement on prices the National,. Coal Board have reviewed the cost of producing andimporting coal and, in order that these costs may be covered by selling prices,they have decided, after consultation with the Industrial and Domestic CoalConsumers&apos; Councils, that pithead prices of coal, other than house coal, shouldbe increased by 12^ per cent. The costs to be covered include the cost of safety and health measures, including those required by the new Mines andQuarries Act, the settlement which the Board hope to reach with the NationalUnion of Mineworkers on wages and the reorganisation of the wage structure,the financing of the increased extent and pace of reconstruction, and the costof importing coal.The Board have reached these decisions after taking into account theviews expressed to them by Her Majesty&apos;s Government about the importancein the public interest of seeking to avoid the increase in the cost of living thatwould follow the raising of house coal prices. Thus there will be no increasein the price of the average and lower grades of house coal which togetherconstitute some two-thirds of total house coal supplies.These price increases will operate from 21st March, 1955.&quot;3.   I ask authority to let the Board proceed as they propose.G. L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,26th February, 1955.Copy No.7047726
