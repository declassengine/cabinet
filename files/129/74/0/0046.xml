THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

(55) 966th April, 1955CABINETPALESTINE settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign. AffairsThe war for Palestine was brought to a close in 1949 by a series of ArmisticeAgreements negotiated between Israel and her four Arab neighbours. the frontiers then established are notoriously unsatisfactory and have given rise toinnumerable incidents, some of them serious. Both the Israelis and the Arabshave been deterred from trying to alter them forcibly, largely by the Anglo-jordan treaty and the Tripartite Declaration of May 1950, and by the presence of her majesty&apos;s Forces in the area. But the hostility between the parlies has notsoftened, nor has any progress been made towards a settlement. More than three-quarters of a million Arab refugees still lead a miserable and uncertain existence,a prey to discontent and subversive propaganda, in camps administered by theUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency (LJ.N.R.W.A.) at an annual cost of some 9 millions, most of which is borne by Her JVlajesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government. Each side wages unremitting psychological warfare on theother. The Arab States have steadily intensified their measures of economic war,closing the Suez Canal to Israeli shipping and to vessels of other nations carryingstrategic materials to Israel, and attempting to boycott foreign firms with branchesor interests in Israel. The armistice, which was intended by the United Nations to lead to a peace settlement, has remained no more than an uneasy truce, and theArab States insist that the state of war continues.2. This conflict is most damaging to our policies in the Middle East and toour political and commercial interests in the area. Fear and hatred of Israel blindthe Arabs to the Soviet threat and inhibit willing co-operation with the West.Resentment against the Western Powers for having created Israel favoursCommunist propaganda and infiltration. The Arabs feel that they have sufferedinjustice at the hands of the international community and humiliation as a result oftheir defeat in the fighting of 1948. So long as these resentments persist, no reliancecan be placed upon their policies or on the stability, of their attitude towards theWestern world.3. Israel, faced by increasing economic difficulties and noting the growth of western assistance to the Arab States, sees the balance of strength and influencemoving steadily against her. At present she would feel strong enough militarilyto defeat any combination of Arab States that would be likely to-form against her.But with Western military aid to Egypt, Iraq and probably other Arab States, thisadvantage will not endure. It is easy for extremists in Israel to argue that the onlyescape from the implacable refusal of the Arabs to make peace and from thestrangling toils of the blockade is to hit out now, while they have the strength todo so.  That such a policy would be suicidal is no assurance against its adoption.47889
If they attack Jordan they would run up against the: Anglo-Jordan-Treaty; butthe knowledge that we could not physically prevent them.overrunning the jordan valley might tempt them to count on our accepting the fait accompli-rather than ..:make war on Israel. Alternatively, they might engineer hostilities &quot;with another of their&apos;Arab neighbours (Egypt, Syria or Lebanon) in circumstances-which theywould calculate would not bring international intervention against; them.;&apos;The very dangerous character of the armistice borders, especially in; Jerusalem, involves a constant risk of serious incidents which might lead to war:4. Far&apos;from easing the situation, as we once hoped, the passage of timemakes it more dangerous and intractable. The difficulty&apos;,&apos;.of./maintaining a&quot; balance &quot; of armed force between the two sides increases&apos;as we&apos;see the need tobuild up the Arab world for defence against Russia. The growing self-confidence of the Arabs as they get richer (from oil) and stronger by association with us ismatched by the increasing anxiety of the Israelis. As time goes on the Arabs will see less and less need to reconcile themselves to the existence of Israel, while the temptation to the Israelis to adopt reckless courses will grow stronger. I do notbelieve we have much time in which to stabilise this very dangerous situation.5. It was in this conviction that I suggested to Mr. Dulles at the end of lastyear that our two Governments should urgently examine the possibility of bringing about a settlement. I suggested that we might apply the methods with which wesuccessfully tackled the problem of Trieste; that is to say, attempt to bring theparties to accept a settlement by separate and confidential negotiations with them,leading, if possible, to direct discussions. Mr. Dulles welcomed this suggestion.He agreed about the danger of the situation and the urgency of finding a solution.He also made the following important point. The policy of the present UnitedStates regime in withholding military and economic aid from Israel during thelast two years, had to. a great extent moderated their expansive and aggressivetendencies; but this policy could not necessarily be sustained for much longer.The coming of elections in the United States in 1957 meant that we had abouttwelve months left in which the United States Administration could pursue an active and constructive line in Palestine matters without the injection of Americanpolitical factors.  He thought we must make full use of it.6. I accordingly sent Mr. Shuckburgh, an Assistant Under-Secretary of State,to Washington in January to discuss the matter with the State Department. these discussions, which were recently concluded in London, have resulted in agreement upon a comprehensive set of proposals for a settlement of the Palestine question.7.   The following is a summary of the main elements in these proposals:  (a) TerritorialThe first and greatest obstacle to be overcome is the unwillingnessof the Arabs to contemplate any settlement at all. It is agreed thatIsrael will have to pay a price for this, and that it will have to includeterritorial concessions, at least of a symbolic character. The questionis whether she can be induced to concede enough. Large transferscannot be.expected, for Israel is small and her people fanaticallyattached to every part of the land for which they fought. The changes proposed have been worked out carefully with the aid of the best available maps and statistics. There has of course been no study on theground. They are designed to restore to Arab villages in Jordan someof the lands from which they are now severed, to award to Syria parts of; the demilitarised zones, to produce a frontier which will, last with aminimum of friction, and to indicate visibly that Israel has been readyto relinquish territory acquired by conquest .and has. consequentlyabandoned all expansionist aims. A small territorial; concession in theSouthern Negey would; give,Egypt a land communication with Jordan,a point to which she attaches great symbolic, importance.:, In,one case (inthe Latrun Salient) a small area.goes to,.Israel in; order-tq director the jerusalem-Tel Aviv road. &apos;(b),RefugeesIsrael, will also have to make amends to tlie- Arab.-refugees. this must include an offer to. re-admit a large number of them as&apos;Israeli-citizens, though few will in fact wish to go. It must also include&quot; payment
nof compensation for the property of those who do not return..-; After-consideration -.of . all Israeli counterclaims,v a payment of &quot;about 100-million is&apos;thought to be necessary. Most of this would have to beprovided from loans by Her Majesty&apos;s Government-and: the UnitedStates Government, but-as large an - amount1 as - possible should beobtained \ from Israel herself and from world Jewry/-if only.in order toshow the Arabs that the Jews have made a sacrifice. (Many refugeeswould still remain a charge to U.N.W.R.A. These would have to bedispersed by resettlement schemes such as the development of the jordan!,Valley, and by capital, investments, possibly through theInternational&apos;Bank, on projects.which would create, employment in. the. Levant States.&apos;(c) Economic warfare the Arab States would be required to repeal all legislation based, on the existence of a state of belligerency, to cease their attempts toprevent trade, between Israel and non-Arab countries, and to remove. restrictions on transit through the Suez Canal. . But they would not be. asked to engage in direct trade-with Israel.  Nor would they be asked^       to   make, &quot;peace&quot;  in   the  full   sense   of - renewing  diplomatic relations &amp;c. at this stage.id) Jerusalem.The internationalisation of Jerusalem and its environs, which was provided for in the United Nations Resolution of 29th November, 1947,is held to be beyond achievement. It is proposed that we should attempt to secure a United Nations Resolution providing for the supervision of, and access to, the Holy Places in a manner acceptable to Israel and Jordan; to divide the Jerusalem &quot; No-man&apos;s Land &quot; between those two States and secure the total or partial demilitarisation of the. city; and then recognise de jure Israeli and Jordanian sovereignty over their respective parts of Jerusalem. This would enable us to recognise the new city of Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital and to move our Embassiesthere.(e) The Jordan Waters. The settlement must include an. agreement on the use ariddistribution of the Jordan waters. Mr. Eric Johnston, who is. President Eisenhower&apos;s special representative in these matters, has worked out a plan which has very nearly gained acceptance on bothsides. If it is not finally accepted before the attempt is made to get a general settlement, it would be made a part of the latter.(/) GuaranteesThese   arrangements   themselves   do   not   contain   sufficientinducements to overcome the Arabs&apos; resistance to any settlement and israel&apos;s reluctance to make the concessions required of her. &quot; Outsideinducements will therefore be necessary. The most important of these,&quot; ; especially for Israeli is an international guarantee of the settlement.-&quot; It is proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and&apos; the UnitedStates Government should give both sides specific guarantees of thenew frontiers established by the settlement. In&apos; the opinion of theauthors of the report this is essential to any negotiated settlement.The guarantees would be embodied in treaties between the British and united States Governments and each of the parties&apos;to&apos;the settlement.They:would&apos;provide for&apos;consultation in the event of a threat of armed attack&quot; by: any&apos; of the parties,&apos;and:for: joint measures to maintain or ifnecessary restore&apos; the agreed :boundaries.: Thus&apos;the Arabs : would be guaranteed against any renewal of Israeli expansionism and Israel givensecurity within her borders. *We should not be&apos;committed to intervene in the case of. boundary incidents or raids, even on the scale of Gaza.This would remain the responsibility of the appropriate United Nationssupervision machinery. The. United States Administration have saidthat -they are prepared to contemplate such commitments in the context of a general settlement, though this is something quite new forthe United States. I think we should go as far as they will.
A. E.Since Egyptian participation is essential to success (seeparagraph 9 below) special inducements must be found for ColonelNasser. These will consist in the promise of military aid, economic,assistance for such projects as the High Aswan Dam, and the prospectof playing a leading role in co-operation with the Western Powers in the affairs of the Eastern Mediterranean.8. I want to draw attention to the financial implications of this plan. her majesty&apos;s Government are already morally committed to contribute towards thecost of any schemes for the resettlement of the Arab refugees which U.N.R.W.A.may undertake. If we could achieve a Palestine settlement, expenditure on these schemes would be speeded up rather than increased. The extra costs arising outof a settlement would consist of inducements to Egypt and other States toco-operate and assistance to Israel for the payment of compensation for Arabrefugee property. I hope that the United States Government will bear the lion&apos;s share of the former, and that Her Majesty?s Government^ liability can be limitedto helping Israel pay the compensation. As far as can be estimated at present, thiswould mean that we should have to make Israel a loan, on unattractive terms andwith doubtful security, of the order of  15 millions, and allow the. Israel-Government to raise a further  10- 15 millions on the London market.9. The report records agreement on a number of questions relating tomethods and timing of the first approaches, the role of other countries such asFrance and Turkey and other matters of detail. I need only say here chat the key to the whole project is thought to lie with the Egyptian Government. none of israels other Arab neighbours would dare to participate in a settlement unless it knew that Egypt was sympathetic. Jordan, which is most directly concerned and which more than any other would benefit from an easement of the tension is too dependent upon Arab League support to make any move alone. Iraq is nota neighbour and is particularly fanatical on the subject. Egypt, on the other hand,is strong, not fanatical about the Jews, and seriously inconvenienced by the tensionon the Gaza frontier. When i spoke to Colonel Nasser in Cairo in February I found him not entirely negative. He thought it was a matter of timing and thatany settlement must be comprehensive. Mr. Dulles and I have therefore agreedthat the first soundings should be made in Cairo and that the plan could be unfoldedto the Israelis only if Colonel Nasser shows a disposition to help. Her Majesty&apos;ambassador and his American colleague have hitherto advised against making animmediate approach owing to Egyptian irritation over the Turco-Iraqi Pact andover the Gaza aggression; but recent conversations between the United states ambassador and the Egyptian Foreign Minister suggest that after Nasser&apos;s returnat the end of April from the Bandoeng Conference it may be possible to make progress.10. I am reporting the above for the information of my colleagues at thisstage. The vital importance of secrecy will be well understood. I recognise the risks of any Anglo-American initiative in this matter and am not over-optimisticabout our chances of success. But i think that the approach which I have described if properly timed and pressed with all the weight of our two Governments,offers the best chance of success and should be tried. The dangers of inaction are so great that some risks must be taken and some financial burdens accepted.
