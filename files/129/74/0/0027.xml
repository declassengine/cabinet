Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1955SECRET Copy No. g$C. (55) 7721st March, 1955  -cabinet united STATES SHIPPING CONDITIONSNote by the Prime MinisterAlthough the Minister of Transport did not wish to bring this matter again before the Cabinet, the following minute which he has sent me is, I think, one that should be read by the Cabinet and if necessary considered again at our next meeting.10 Downing Street. S.W. I,18th March, 1955.Prime MinisterACCEPTANCE OF 50 PER CENT. SHIPPING conditions. With the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I attach a statementapproved by the Chancellor following the Economic Policy Committee conclusions this morning on the above subject.2.   I wish to express my deep concern at the decision taken.3. The matter was, as you will recall, also discussed at Cabinet yesterday.In view of weight of opinion both in Cabinet and in Economic Policy Committee,I do not think any useful purpose would be served.by my seeking to submit-thematter again to Cabinet.4.   A decision by this country to accept a 50 per cent, shipping condition in -respect of the proposed cotton deal, and of the proposed Tobacco / United StatesAirforce Housing deal, involves the abandonment of resistance by this country to
this shipping condition in transactions under United States Public Law 480. Thatlaw is a law not for the provision of aid, but for the disposal of United StatesAgricultural Surpluses. We have previously taken the lead in resisting theimposition of this condition in transactions under Public Law 480 though we haveaccept it under Public Law 665, which is the measure under which aid is provided. -5.   Our lead in resisting this condition under Public Law 480 has been followed!j 0   by the other countries of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.The only exception was one such transaction by Turkey.  Norway, on the otherhand, refused an attractive coal deal because of the proposed shipping clause.6. The proposal to accept this condition in respect of these two transactionsunder Public Law 480 therefore involves a change of policy in resistance to flagdiscrimination generally. Such a change by the leading maritime nation mustgreatly weaken general resistance to flag discrimination practices (of which the50 per cent, provision is the worst).7. The shipping industry has protested vigorously against acceptance of this condition even in respect of transactions under the aid provision (Public Law 665).Manchester Guardian leading article of March 14th is attached.*8. In my opinion there will be very severe criticism of the Government fromthe shipping industry, and more generally when the two decisions referred to inattached note are announced.9. These criticisms will, in my opinion, be fully justified. Freedom fromrestrictions on shipping are of vital importance to this country, whose shipping industry has gross earnings of  663 millions a year. To abandon an important point of principle with inevitable repercussions in countries which have so farfollowed our lead, for the sake of two once and for all deals in cotton and tobaccoof relatively no great magnitude, seems to me most unwise.10. Moreover, other countries whose Merchant Navies are less efficient thanours are doing all they can artificially to force trade on to their own ships. If theysucceed and the practice spreads, the long-term damage to our shipping and henceto our prosperity would be immense.11.   By accepting this condition in these cases we also destroy the chance of-  inducing the Americans to abandon this highly discriminatory condition.   It isreported to-day that United States Farm Bureau Federation has indicatedopposition to it.12. I think you would wish to be informed of the possibility of serious troubleover this. I am sending a copy of this minute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.J. A. B.-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,March, 1955.* Not printed.
\UNITED STATES AID AND THE FIFTY PER CENT. SHIPPINGREQUIREMENTThe United Kingdom Government have now given further consideration tothe proposed transactions in American surplus agricultural commodities under theUnited States Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act 1954 (PublicLaw 480), with particular reference to the requirement that 50 per cent, of the commodities should be carried in United States ships.The Government reaffirm their strong objection in principle, which is shared by the other O.E.E.C.. countries, to all forms of flag discrimination. They would find it impossible to accept the requirement in transactions which do not constitute aid.As regards the sale of American tobacco, the latest proposal of the UnitedStates authorities that the sterling proceeds should be appropriated to the UnitedKingdom Defence Budget would mean that the transaction did, in form, constitutedirect aid. Moreover, the use of this counterpart to build houses which would belet to the United States Air Force, at a nominal rent, would be in the defence interests&apos; of both the United Kingdom and the United States, and would indeed bea contribution to the joint defence of Europe. The Government have&apos; also takenaccount of the fact that the proposed sale of tobacco is part of a package dealwhich, taken as a whole, constitutes substantial direct aid for this country.The Government are accordingly prepared to accept an arrangement underwhich $15 millions of tobacco is purchased under Public Law 480, the proceedsbeing appropriated to the United Kingdom Defence Budget. They for. their partwill undertake the provision of housing for the use of the United States Air force to an equivalent value, subject to agreement on certain administrative details.The Government must emphasise that they regard this as an exceptionaltransaction which creates no precedent.As regards the proposed transaction for the supply of cotton textiles to pakistan by third countries, under which payment for the textiles would take theform of surplus American raw cotton, the Government take the view that thistransaction is clearly one in which welcome aid is given to a member of theCommonwealth. While maintaining their strong objections to flag discrimination,the Government are prepared to agree in principle to the participation of theUnited Kingdom in this transaction and to accept, without prejudice to any similartransaction in the future, the requirement that 50 per cent, of the raw cotton tobe shipped under these arrangements to this country should be carried in UnitedStates vessels. They have informed the Government of Pakistan accordingly, whowill now take into account the tenders for the supply of textiles made by UnitedKingdom manufacturers.
