COPY NO. 6 6CABINETRATING AND VALUATION BILL,Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (55) 52)refers to the new legislation which will be necessary before re-valuationcan come iirio force,,     It may assist the Cabinet to have some further particulars of the proposed Bill.Gas Boards2,        The nationalisation of the Gas Industry made it necessary to revise the methods of assessing their premises.    The changes proposed were agreed some IS months ago with the Local Authority Associations and the gas Boards-    They are, therefore, unlikely to prove controversial.Church Buildings and Charities3. Local Authorities have for many yearss as a matter of policy,under-assessed church halls, and the premises of educational, charitableand philanthropic bodies,,    There is no statutory authority for this practice and the Inland Revenue, who have now taken over responsibilityfor rating, do not feel that they can continue it without authority,,    TheBill will legalise the practice.Procedure for Appeals4,        Under the present law, a ratepayer has the opportunity to appeal against his assessment when the draft valuation list is published at theend of October,,    If unsuccessful, he can. renew his appeal after the newvaluation comes into opei-ation on 1st April.5,        The Bill will abolish the prior publication of valuation lists indraft.    Instead it will provide for the publication, in April3 of the newvaluations (calculated by the Inland Revenue) simultaneously with thepublication of the new rate poundage (fixed by the Local Authority),,    These,taken together, determine the actual amount which the ratepayer has topay,6.        There may be some leakage of information when the lists aresent to the local authorities by the Inland Revenue at the end of December.But, in the main, these revised arrangements should avoid the creationof premature, and perhaps unfounded, alarm among ratepayers.7.        In addition^ the Bill will provide that a ratepayer who has appealedagainst his assessment shall not be called upon to pay more than he paidin the previous year until his appeal is settled.&apos;    SECRET21st February. 1955
