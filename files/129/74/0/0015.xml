DRAFT WHITE paper i. introduction. The 1955 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has now been held in accordance with section 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947.   In the light of it theGovernment have determined the guarantees to apply for livestock and livestock products in the year April, 1955* to March, 1956, and forcrops from the 1956 harvest.    These are  set out in Appendix V.2.     A Special Review, on account of changes in wage costs, has beenheld concurrently with the Annual Review  an.a the results have alreadybeen announced.   The details are set out in Appendix VI.    These special review determinations relate to crops of the 1955 harvest, and tolivestock products of 1954/5 - i.e., in each case a year earlier thanthe period to which the present Annual Review determinations relate.II.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural IndustryProduction Progress3.    Agricultural net output for the   year 1954/55 is forecast at 53/ above pre-war.   The revised index number for last year, 1955/54 is55% utwsre pre-war. The decline is due to the particularly%od &quot;weatkerconditions; that it has not been greater is due to the  determined effort andskill of the industry.   But for the weather, net output would have beenhigher than last year, sinoe an inorease in livestock output (pigs andfat cattle) has more than offset a decline in the acreage under crops.This year&apos;s production of milk and eggs is estimated to be slightlyabove last year&apos;s,      and the underlying trend of milk production stillappears to be upwards.Changes in Posts4.     Statistics of changes in cos 1s are shown in Appendix III.    There isa substantial ^increasejestiicated to amount -to .about-^^niiillion in a year for Review commodities and about  452&quot; million for all commodities.Increases in the price of feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry areautomatically reflected in increases in the prices guaranteed forthese products.   Accordingly some  5g- million of the increase in costs in respect of feeding stuff price increases need not be taken
further into account.   In addition a further part of the estimated increase in costs assessed at  8-g- million for Review commodities willhave &quot;been met by the industry while still achieving the net incomeforecast for the current year to the 31st May, 1955*   Thus theadditional costs in relation to Review commodities, to be taken intoaccount as likely to have a substantial further effect in i955/56.may be put at about  25 million.Changes in Income5.     The forecast of total farm net income for 1954/55 is  280 million,and compares with  320-g- million in      1953/54*   This reflects the adverse weather conditions in 1954/55. whereas there were favourable conditions in 1953/54o   When adjusted for normal weather conditions,net income is estimated at  312 million for 1954/55; the comparablefigure for 1953/54 was  306;? million,60     The efficiency of the industry has evidently continued toincrease at least at the rate previously attained.   Although the bad weather conditions have reduced actual net income this year, theindustry&apos;s net income on a normal weather basis has been maintained inspite of the reductions in price guarantees determined at the lastAnnual Review.   This is largely due to the continuing increase in\ *.. *efficiency which the Government assess at something like  30 million a year for the industry as a whole and about  25 million a year for review commodities alone,.Economic Condition of the Industry7o     The Government&apos;s assessment of the economic condition of theindustry is that, on the basis of normal weather, a satisfactory levelof remuneration is being maintained; that continuing improvements inefficiency may be expected on a scale which should offset the effect on future net income of the current increase in costs; but that there hasbeen a temporary setback this year owing to the exceptionally bad weather conditions.
(be?III.    Production and Guarantee policy.     The Government   have reviewed production and guarantee policy inthe light of the above conclusions and their views are set out in the immediately following paragraphs.     As last year they have also examined the progress and prospects of the industry for each of the maincommodities:    these are referred to in paragraphs  ^2A - 34-J*Future Production9o     The Government&apos;s view on future production remains as stated in paras. 42 and 43 of last year&apos;s Annual Beview White Paper (Cmd. 9104)*Although a general indication can be given of the directions in whichproduction should be developed, it is not practicaole or desirable to try to state precise commodity production targets in free market conditions.10.    The Govei-nment continue to look to an increase in the net outputof the industry by means of:-(i) more beef;  and more mutton and lamb (particularly if unitcosts of production can be reduced);(ii) continued steady improvement in crop yields;(iii) a saving in the heavy bill for feed imports by -(a)   more ley farming, improved management and use of grass,.and (b)    skill and economy in the use of concentrated feedingstuffs.11.    Following the return to free market conditions, there has been a fall in tillage area - 469*000 acres in the United Kingdom in the lastyear.   Although production of b-^ef, mutton and lamb has continued to expand, the increase in livestock production is not sufficient to ensurethat full use can be made of the increased area of grass resulting fromthe decline in tillage, in additionto the grassland already availabe.At the same time, purchases of animal feed, mainly imported, have continued at a high level - some 2 million tons a year, worth about 55 million c.i.f., above the level of consumption of two years ago.A considerable part of this has been reflected an increased output of livestock products, particularly pigs, but there, is clearly scope for making greater use of our own resources for the maintenance.of livestockproduction.    The Government consider that the best use will be made ofour land in present circumstances if the output and use of home-grownf eedin-,stuff s is increased.- &apos;: - 3 -    I    j$:
12.   The aim on every farm should be to secure the most profitablebalance between cropland grass production within a flexible system which will allow adaptations to changing economic conditionswithout loss of farming efficiency.   The foundation of a stablelong-term agricultural policy aimed at the production of asatisfactory proportion of our food at home must be maintenanceof the productive capacity of our farm land and continuousimprovement of farming practice.Maintenance of Ley Farming13.   It is clearly desirable to maintain a large arable area(the area devoted to crops and temporary grass), and theGovernment would not -wish to see a trend away from crop husbandrythat might endanger this.   The decline in the area under tillagecrops in the last year has been almost entirely outside the  ;j-traditional cereal growing areas.   So far as practicable, landgoing out of craps should remain in a rotation in the form ofleys rather than going down to permanent grass.   Any reductionin the acreage of arable land should be confined so far aspossible to those farms or fields least suited to ploughing.It will thus be desirable to continue the encouragement ofley farming and to keep the plough going round the farm on allsuitable fields.   Progress towards reducing the unit cost of cropproduction should also be continued.
Use of Grass12)-.   Development on the above lines must be accompanied by improvement ofexisting permanent grass and improved management of grassland generally.   Theadditional grass vri.ll need to be used fully and effectively throughout theyear; this will require, among other things, the more rapid adoption of improved techniques of grazing, conservation and feeding.15*   The more effective use of grass and grass products will help to reducethe costs of livestock production and will also allow a larger part of thepresent output of livestock products to be produced from home-gi&quot;own materialsoThis is one of the best ways in which the farmer can help the national economy.   The replacement of purchased feeds, which are largely imported,not only increases the output of agriculture from cur own resources, and thereby helps the nation&apos;s external balance of payments, but is alsogenerally in the farmer&apos;s own interests,   As stated in last year&apos;s annual review White Paper 10$ of concentrates saved will be worth at least one million tons of imports - and there will be a corresponding increase in thefigure for net output at home.Guarantee Policy1o.   The general considerations of policy remain as stated in last year&apos;annual Review Y/hite   Paper.   In partioular, a primary objective must be tosecure a more rapid improvement in economic efficiency by raising quality,catering for consumer choice, and reducing unit costs of production.   Therehas been a downward trend in some market prices and the cost of the supportgiven to agriculture continues to be high - approaching  250 million this year.17*   The cost of the Government&apos;s assistance per unit of production isparticularly heavy for certain commodities, notably at the present time pigs,eggs and wheat.   It is necessary also to consider the trend of demand and toavoid further increases in output of commodities which would create problemsof disposal and would be likely to weakon the market.   This considerationapplies not only where the cost of Exchequer assistance is at presentexceptionally heavy, as for pigs, but also to milk where sales in the liquidmarket have hardly been maintained and it is clear that there is an underlyingupward trend in volume of production.189   The Government have been particularly-concerned over the high level of support required for pig production at current price levels.   They feel thatit is essential to reduce this liability, particularly while the costs of
, &quot;producing pig meat in this country remain so high relative to those elsewhere.At the same time they recognise that pig producers were asked to expandproduction and that changes in the level of profitability required to adjust the rate of production should be made gradually.19o   The main features of the determinations are an increase in price guarantees for coarse grains and production grants for ploughing and fertilisers toencourage arable and ley farming, and an increase in price guarantees for fatcattle, sheep and lambs and in the calf subsidy to encourage an expansion inthe numbers of grass eating animals.   On the other hand the price guarantee for pigs haj been reduced to avoid encouraging further expansion and to check theExchequer cost020.   In general, the objective has been to make adjustments thatiake accountof production requirements, market prospects and Exchequer liability, and at thesame time to provide the industry with the stability and resources required toenable it to adapt production as necessary and to continue its net output at ahigh level and indeed expand it in the direction most needed.   The Governmenthave also been concerned that the industry should have the resources necessaryfor continued development of efficient production along these lines after the exceptional difficulties of weather which it has had to contend with this year,,Apart from the direct losses suffered, the industry has a continuing burden of serious arrears of work to be made good, and of loss of condition of land andin some cases of livestock.(Alternative para. 20.   In general the objective has been to adjust thedistribution of Exchequer assistance to take account of productionrequirements and the particular circumstances of the industry.   The need to reduce the strain on the balance of payments in respect of thepurchase of overseas f eedingstuffs j.s apparent.   The importance of reducing the cost to the Exchequer of assistance to agriculture is as great as ever.   The Government have also, however, been concerned thatthe industry should have the stability and resources required (in faceon this occasion of incroases in costs outside its conrol coupled withexceptionally adverse weather) to enable it to adapt production as necessary and to maintain its net output and, indeed, expand it in the directions most needed.   Apart from direct losses of crops and stock inthe past year the industry has a continuing burden of serious arrears ofwork to bo made good and of loss of condition of land and, in some cases,of livestock.   In all these circumstances it has not been possible onthis occasion to reduce Exchequer liability and indeed some increase inassistance to the industry is necessary.)IV.    Determination of Guarantees21 o   The following are the Governments determinations of the guarantees to apply for livestock and livestock products in the year 1955/56 and for crops from the1956 harvest.   Additional details are given in Appendix V.Production Grants220   The Government have reviewed the existing production grants which amount to about  50 million a year.   They have decided that furtherencouragement should be given to the use of fertilisers and lime,- 6 -
6swhich are essential for the maintenance and improvement of fertility of cropand grassland, to ley farming and alternate husbandry and to the rearing ofcalves on which the expansion of beef production depends.    They have, there-fore determined upon the following increases.    The lime subsidy will beincreased on 1st April from 5Q&amp; to 60)2 and in four summer months from 60$to 10fo,     The payment on spreading costs will also be increased to GOfo. from 1st. July next increased rates of subsidy y/ill be fixed for nitrogen andphosphates involving (on the rate of consumption in the current year)additional payments of  3i million in aggregate.   The ordinary ploughinggrant will be increased from  5 to  8 an acre, and the special  10 an acregrant will be increased to  13 an acre.    The calf subsidy will be increased from an average of  5 to an average of  7. 10s. Od.   A special payment of5s. Od. a ewe in standard rate flocks (2s.6d. in reduced rate flocks)administered on the same lines as the Hill Sheep Subsidy Schemes will bemade in respect of eligible sheep on the farm at 4-th December, 1954*    On1954/55 quantities the total of these increases would be the equivalent ofabout  12?, million.    In so far as there are increases in the quantitiesthe actual additional expenditure may be greater.Fat Cattle, Sheen, and Lambs.24.    The market results indicate that there is still need for more goodquality beefs mutton and lamb;    though for mutton and lamb at least the longer term prospects   depend on further reduction in unit costs ofproduc+ion.    The average standard price for fat cattle (steers, heifers .and &quot;special young cows&apos;) is being increased from 133s. 2d. a live cwt.to s.    d. a live cwt.    The average standard price for fat sheep andlambs will be increased from 2s. 10gd. a lb.  to        s.    d. a lb.25*     The position in regard to i&apos;at cows and fat ewes has been reviewed.As indicated in last year&apos;s White Paper these classes of stock are properlyregarded as bj-products of the dairy industry and of sheep breeding andnot therefore appropriate for inclusion within the fatstook guarantees.Fat ewes have not been so included since decontrol.   Fat cows have beeneligible for a collective guarantee, but in fact no payments have been required.    The Government have decided that the time has come when fatcows (other than &quot;special young cows&apos;), like fat ewes, should, in future,be outside the guarantees.Fat Pigs26.    Production of pig meat has now passed the total originallyexpected by 1955/56.   Despite the decrease in the guarantee after the
last Annual Review, the number of pigs has increased  further.   Therate of subsidy per score has continued to rise; it is now too highand oust be reduced,   vie cannot afford any further expansion in thefproduction of pigraeat.   further, as stated last year, overriding importance attaches to improvement in quality and substantial reductionin costs.   The Government have therefore decided that the value of thoguarantee must be reduced by 2s. 6d. per score deadweight.   Even so therate of subsidy per score will be very high and the Government willf    -have to look for further reduction in Exchequer liability in thefuture.eejks.  (Hen and Duck)-27. The market in 1954/55 has been en the whole weaker than in theprevious year: the number of eggs passing through paoking stationshas increased appreciably. The oost of the guarantee has therefore been greater both by reason of the higher rate of payment per dozenand the greater quantity of eggs attracting the guarantee.    It-remains the general principle of policy that maintenance or -expansionof output must depend upon a firmer market or reduction in averagecosts.   The Government have decided that in the circumstances no change should be made in the value of the guccrantee.\Progeny Testing28.    The Government are setting up. progeny testing stations inGreat Britain with the object of improving the economie conditionof the pig and poultry industries.   For pigs the capital cost ofproviding the stations and initial capital is estimated at 4-50,000..   The poultry stations are estimated to cost  492,000.-These expenditures have been taken into account and the GovernmenthhhhHIIHBBHHBHHHHHHB^and the National Fanners&apos; Unions have agreed that they shall be recovered from the pig and poultry industries by reductions inthe payments which would otherwise have been made under theguarantee arrangements in 1955/56 and subsequent years.    the reductions are set out in Appendix V.
29.    The production objective remains as stated in the last annual review White Paper, to stabilise sales off farms at a level somewhatbelow 1953/54 by reducing tne/^airy herd so as to offset the increasein yield per cow.    Expansion must depend on whether the market forliquid milk can be expanded.    This market has declined somewhatsince 1951/52 and although it is hoped that this declining trendhas now been brought to a halt the market is not yet expandingagain.   Despite the adverse weather conditions production   during thecurrent year has been alightly higher than last year -   and there isan underlying steady upward trend owing to the continuing increasein yield per cow.   The Government have decided that the guaranteed price should remain unchanged but milk producers will get seme indirectlhelp through the increases in production grants and in the guarantee for oats.30. No alteration is proposed this year in the standard quantitiesor primary proportions for each marketing area, but these will be reviewed again next year when there vriLll have been more experience-of the working of the arrangement s.Wool31.     It is proposed to introduce revised arrangements that are tobe put into operation from the beginning of the wool year 1955/56,under which the guarantee will be to the British Wool MarketingBoard on behalf of producers and the guaranteed price will allow for the marketing costs of the Board which have hitherto been thesubject of a separate guarantee.    The guaranteed price so determined for 1955/56 will be 58^d. per lb.    This represents no change inthe value of the guarantee. The Government have agreed, for one more year, to request the British Wool Marketing Board to continuethe payment, within the guaranteed price,of the special bonus of3d. per lb.  on the wool of certain breeds of hill sheep.. Cereals32.     The production of cereals must continue to play an important part in the balance of crop and grass production to which reference has been made in paragraph 12 above and in the maintenance of a largearable area Isased on a rotational system of crops and grass.   The pricJguarantees for wheat and coarse grains need to be brought closer togethlThe Government have therefore ore decided to raise the guaranteed prices f oglbarley and oats and to leave that for wheat unchanged.
33*   As stated in the 1954- Annual Review White Paper, the purpose of thesupport price that will operate for the 1955 harvest and subsequently is toprotect producers against low returns in years of high yield.   The government consider that this purpose will be achieved by determining the United kingdom average support price for sound ware potatoes from, the 1956 harvest at215s. 10d. per ton.Sugar Beet34o The Government wish to see the present sugar beet acreage maintained. Theprioe determined for- 1956/57 is s.     d.V.   Effect of Determinations35.   The effect of any particular determinations on the net income of thoindustry cannot be precisely forecast in conditions of a free economy.   the guarantees are now a supplement, where necessary, to returns on sales in a competitive market, and in any case cosxiodity prices and production grants arenot the only factors affecting net income.36.   The industry starts with a net income, on a normal weather basis, ofsome  312 million.   Known additional costs that will have to be borne lay theindustry in 1955/5^ are of the order of  25 million for review commoditicsrOn the other hand the increase wn this occasion in the value of the guarantees is some      million.   In addition there should be the extra net income resulting from the continuing increase in efficiency - expected tobe about  30 million a year for the industry as a whole and  25 million for review commodities.   Past experience confirms the tendency of net income to increase as a result of increasing efficiency.   The   Governmentsgenera.1 assessment is accordingly that as a result of the determinationsnow made net income on a normal weather basis should at least be maintained and, with the continued improvement in efficiency should show some increase.37*   As was stated in last year*s Annual Review White   Paper, the actualoutcome will largely depend on the success of the industry itself in bringing down its unit costs of production and getting the best out of thomarket.
