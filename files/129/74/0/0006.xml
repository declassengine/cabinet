(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY SS GOVERNMENT)SECRETC0(55) 56Zl&amp;t Februaryy 1955RATING AND VALUATIONMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceIf there is no legislation, and no Ox&apos;dei* postponing the valuationlists3 the draft valuation lists must be available by the end of November^1955, and final lists by the end of December.2.        But since the valuation officer has a discretions it may well bethat he will publish the lists in October0    This is not desirablee3Q        Therefore, it would seem that either legislation or an order is necessary,40        Legislation is also required to deal with some outstanding points, such as gas undertakings, charities etc and is desirable in orderto bring the date of publication of lists and operation of new poundagerates closer together,.    If this is not done, there will be a great outcryand (as in the past) the whole scheme may collapse.5.        I think this is an even more important argument for legislationthan those in paragraph 3 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer ls paper(C.(55) 52)s  (i)  only refers to valuation of new or altered property!(ii) deals with a very old grievance, and to some extent cancels out thedesire of authorities to value high under (i),6,        But if it is true (as stated in C, (55) 52) that the Bill now providesthat the new values are not- in fact disclosed till April 1956, a considerableflexibility is given.    This is a vital point, and should be confirmed.    Iftrue, it is a strong argument for legislation^7,        I venture to circulate this note, as I was away in Glasgow whenthe Chancellor of the Exchequers draft came to me.COPY NO,hiCABINETHoM.Ministry of Defence, S0W01021st February, 1955,
