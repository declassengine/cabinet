Copy No.COAL PRODUCTION : ST. LEGERNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate, for consideration by theCabinet, the letter below from the Senior Steward of the Jockey Club.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th March, 195515, Cavendish Square,London, W.1,1st March, 1955.Dear Prime Minister,I write to you as a Member of the Jockey Club to inform you of our negotiations with the Minister of Fuel and Power, the National Coal Board and theEast and West Riding Regional Board for Industry regarding the day of the week on which the St. Leger should be run.The St. Leger has always been run on the traditional day, Wednesday, until after the war, when we altered it to Saturday at the request of the Governmentowing to the conditions prevailing.The Doncaster Corporation and local Chamber of Commerce are emphaticthat the St. Leger run on a Saturday causes congestion and traffic chaos in thetown-in addition the race traffic and football traffic make an unmanageableproblem for the local police.Ever since 1947 the Stewards of the day have consulted with the Ministerof Fuel and Power on this problem, and the fixture has been varied at his request;but, in our opinion, the situation has now arisen, after repeated meetings, whereGovernment intervention is no longer warranted.The Stewards of the Jockey Club consider that, as they are responsible for conducting racing, they are entitled, ten years after the war, to the fullestinformation as to why this one fixture in the racing calendar is singled out of thewhole calendar of sport for Government intervention.Figures have been collected and statements made by both the Coal Boardand Industry as to the loss in production that the country would suffer if the raceis run on a Saturday. The Stewards submit that these are all assumptions, and infact the Chairman of the North-Eastern Coal Board agreed.Between Monday, 10th January, 1955, and Monday, 7th February, 1955,Association Football Cup-Tie Replays in Yorkshire and Durham were attended by 343,000 people all these matches being played mid-week and apparently theseattendances have passed without any complaint from the National Coal Board orany Production Council. The average attendance on St. Leger day is about 70,000.In view of the unconvincing evidence put before the Stewards at the variousmeetings, they requested the Minister of Fuel and Power, if he would not allow47765Printed for the Cabinet; March 1955-confidential. (55) 638th March, 1955CABINET
the race to return to its traditional day, Wednesday, to agree to the race being runon a Wednesday in 1955 and 1956, with the promise from the Stewards of theJockey Club that if it could be proved, as a result of loss of production, thecountry suffered, they would agree to the race being run on a Saturday in future.The Minister of Fuel and Power has agreed to put this proposal before theCabinet for approval.I feel it my duty, as Senior Steward, to inform you of these negotiations.Yours sincerely,R. G. FEILDEN.
