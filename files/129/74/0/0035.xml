secret.(55) 8526th March, 1955CABINETRENFREW airport memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandTthe Minister of Supply and the Minister of Transport and civil aviation at the meeting of the Cabinet on 21st December, 1954,(C,C, (54) 90th Conclusions, Minute 4) the balance of opinion was infavour of allowing British European Airways (B.E.A.) to transfer itsmaintenance work from Renfrew Airport to London Airport, as soon asfirm assurances had been obtained that the Renfrew premises, whenthey came available, would be leased by air work Ltd. for work under contract with Canadair Ltd.2.        The Cabinet invited the Minister of Supply and the Minister ofTransport to report to the Prime Minister the results of their further negotiations with air work Ltd. and, if these were successful, to seekhis authority to inform be.A. that they might proceed with the transferof their maintenance work from Renfrew to London.3.        We have now reached the following position.4.        The Canadian Government have agreed that Sabre aircraft work,at present done by the Bristol Aerox^lane Company at Filton, should betransferred to another contractor at Renfrew.    The Bristol aeroplane company require the space at Filton for the production of Britannia air-craft.    We understand, however, that the Canadians propose to nominateScottish Aviation Ltd. and not air work Ltd. for this work;  this isprobably an advantage so far as Scottish opinion goes.5.        Once they are told that they can move, BJD.A. will make spaceavailable at Renfrew almost immediately for the new contractor, so thathis staff can be built up gradually as the Corporation^ staff is reducedover a period of some months.    When the moves are complete, theCanadian work should provide enough employment to absorb B.E.Afsredundancy.    There should, in all events, be a choice of alternative employment for all concerned.6.        There has been so much organised opposition in Scotland tothe move of the B.E.A. base that we should be surprised if there is noprotest when these arrangements are announced.    There may becriticism because the terms and conditions of employment for the contract work will be those applicable to the engineering industry generally, which are slightly less favourable than those in the civil air transport industry.    The Government cannot, however, be expected to guarantee that the conditions to which the men have been accustomed in air transport employment should be continued in another industry.COPY NO.

7. We consider that this is the best arrangement which can be madein the circumstances,8.        This has been reported to the Prime Minister, and he hasdirected -that the subject be brought before the Cabinet at an early-opportunity.    We therefore seek the approval of the Cabinet to theMinister of Transport -(i)   informing British European Airways that they canproceed with the transfer of their maintenance work from Renfrew to London; and(ii)   announcing these arrangements to parliament on a convenient occasion.J.S.S.L.J.A.B. -C.25th March, 1955
