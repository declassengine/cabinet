-257/THIS DOCUMENT rS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT fThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.&apos; It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No... .4.0C.(55) 89 ,29th March, 1955CABINETCOTTON INDUSTRY: DRAFT STATEMENTMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have circulated separately my comments upon the Cotton3oard&apos;s proposals for restricting imports (C. (55) 88).    I set out in that paper a scheme whereby this could, if it were so decided, be done.    Inthe Annex to this present paper is what I think we ought to say if we decide to act.2. I am deeply concerned at the likely public reaction andeconomic results of the draft scheme I have propounded in C. (55) 88particularly if it is put forward as our sole contribution to the problem.In Lancashire it will be represented as too little and too late.    Outsidethe textile industry it will be criticised for leading to an inevitablecontraction of trading opportunities in India and for breaking the longtradition of the open door in Colonial trade.    Everywhere it will be saidthat we have made a rather squalid little retreat in the face of protectionistpressure while fearing to deal with the larger problem of exports-or the pressing need to get the cotton textile industry to put its house in order.There will be enough truth in all these criticisms to make them sting.3. Responsible opinion would expect us to deal with all threematters - imports, exports, action in Lancashire - together.    TheSocialist solution to the latter will be a planned reorganisation of the industry.What is ours ?    The Conservative answer should be a reasonable level of tariff protection, the removal of the admitted distortions caused by the &quot;D&quot;Scheme, the examination and where necessary elimination of any restrictivearrangements which may be shown to be against the national interest and within that framework, freedom and encouragement for both sides of theindustry to put their house in order.-4. I do not under-estimate what needs to be done within the textile industry.    Nevertheless, appeals to them to reorganise, to re-deploytheir labour force, to concentrate on higher quality lines of production will be of small avail unless we take some of the actions which lie within our own control.5. In a comprehensive plan which included both protection and purchase tax, there would be scope for action within the industry itself.It would certainly provide a basis upon which we could call upon both sidesto consider urgently how best competitive efficiency can be improved.    Itis for consideration whether we should not at the same time refer thespinners1 ring to the Monopolies Commission.   I, personally, would recommend this course.    There is not likely to be a better opportunity.This ring is probably a principal factor in preserving the existing-1-
*2&amp;bhorizontal structure of the industry and preventing the combination ofmany spinning and weaving concerns which might otherwise take place,and which so many able critics consider to be necessary if the weak weavingend of the industry is to be strengthened.    To give protection, at greatcost to other industries, and not to do what we can at the same time toimprove efficiency of this one, would, I consider, be wrong.6, Lastly, as to purchase tax, I would be prepared to developorally my belief that the removal of this tax is central to our problems inthe textile industry, that the industry is a special and distinguishablecase and that the removal of the tax need not be extended more thanmarginally beyond it.    I would also be prepared to develop the argument against attempting anything less than the complete removal of the purchase tax here.    Any halfway house solution may indeed well lead to bothcommercial damage and political unpopularity.7, Against this background - and on the assumption that we decide to act.on textiles - I have drafted what I consider ought to be said.For convenience I have drafted it as a statement by one Minister althoughnaturally I recognise that the responsibility falls more widely.    The draft is only a rough and preliminary one and if the general policy outlined init is accepted much work will need to be done on it,8. Lastly, the time factor.    We should declare our policy before we rise for Easter. In that case, and-bearing in mind the necessarypreparatory work inside and outside this country, a policy decision isrequired not later than the day this paper is taken in Cabinet.9. I ask that if action is decided to be necessary, a CabinetCommittee should be appointed and the draft statement annexed-shouldbe taken as the basis upon which we should proceed.T3 TBoard of Trade, S.Wal.28th March, 1955.annex draft STATE ME nt the Government has been giving consideration to the situation of the cotton textile industry.    While employment and production still remain reasonably high in that industry there is no doubt that it presentsaspects and problems more sombre than the general picture of industrialprosperity which is typical of British industry as a whole.    Decliningexports and a steep rise in those imports of grey cloth which are duty-free and retained in this country have recently combined to increase the amountof short-time working.    A deputation from the Cotton Board was recently received by the Government and has made representations on these subjects.The Government having considered these representations arenow in a position to state the actions which they propose to take.
It is the considered view of the Government that the problemsfacing the industry are as much if not more concerned with exports thanthey are with imports and that the ultimate solution to them must be sought in Lancashire as well as in Whitehall.There are therefore three matters with which I wish todeal: the rate of imports, action in Lancashire and exports.    I willtake imports first.    The Government do not take the view that a caseexists for world wide restriction of imports under the Escape Clauseprovided by Article XLX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Outside the Commonwealth imports are subject to a negotiated, most-favoured-nation rate which amounts in the case of grey cloth to I7j[ percent.    This rate has been bound in negotiation and it is not our present intention to seek to re-negotiate it.    The real import problem arises from the sharp increase in duty-free grey cloth from India and Hong Kongwhich is brought here for processing; about half of this is re-exportedand about half retained.    That part of this cloth which is re-exported we regard as valuable alike to the Commonwealth and to United Kingdommerchants and the finishing section of the industry.    As to the grey clothretained in this country, the Government have decided that the increasein this trade in recent months necessitates safeguarding action.    TheGovernment therefore propose to consult with India and Hong 2Cong onthe best way in our mutual interest to regulate this trade in future.In the meantime and while these consultations are in progress we havedecided as a temporary measure, and in order to prevent what would bean inevitable attempt at forestalling, to impose a quota restriction on duty-free imports of cotton grey cloth destined for the home market.This quota will hold these imports in future to an annual rate of75 million square yards, which is estimated to have been the rate in1954,    This quota will apply only to those countries whose goods are subject to neither duty nor quota, that is to say, it will not apply to Canadaor to Europej  separate arrangements apply, of course, to Japan.Duty-free entry of goods from the Commonwealth and Colonieshas long formed part of the pattern of our Commonwealth commercial policy - over a large field it will remain so,.   There may nevertheless be examples where, since the arrangements for free entry were established,a new situation has arisen.    In some such cases it may prove, on examination of all the factors, to be necessary that a degree of tariff protection should be afforded to United Kingdom manufacturers.    Eachcase must, however, be examined on its merits having regard among other things both to the extent and nature of the industrialisation which has takenplace in the Commonwealth country concerned and the situation in whichthe United Kingdom industry finds itself placed.   An- important consideration in all cases must be the maintenance of the highest possible level of inter-Commonwealth trade and the preservation to the maximum extent of existing reciprocal advantages.So much for action upon grey cloth imports.    Protectivearrangements may provide a measure of security for the home market,but in the absence of full competitive efficiency they will provide littlesafeguard for the future and, in particular, they will be of no assistancein the export markets.    The future prosperity of this industry, like thatof any other, depends on its efficiency, on its ability to keep ahead of its competitors, its readiness to adopt new ideas and if necessary new methodsof organisation, and to evolve new lines of production, and its deter ^mination to reduce and eliminate restrictions upon change and output.In the main, these are matters almost wholly within the control and responsibility of the industry itself.    Much has been done - much more
needs to be done if we are to hold old markets and win new ones.    It isthe Governments earnest hope that leaders from both sides of the industry will lose no time in coming forward and meeting together so as to decide how best this task can be speeded up throughout the whole of the industry.The Government too has a responsibility both for creating the conditionsin which development, expansion and change within the industry are possible, and in arranging where necessary for the examination of restrictive and monopolistic practices on the employers1 side in orderto ensure that they do not operate against the national interest in thebroadest sense of that term.In the case of the calico printing industry the Government havealready announced their decision.    Without expressing any view as tothe need or appropriateness of other arrangements within the industry,the Government have decided that the price-fixing arrangements of the spinners and doublers should be referred to the Monopolies Commission.Lastly, as to the conditions in which the industry can prosper.The high level of demand at home in itself provides a sound basis forprosperity.    The Government are however impressed by the need to do everything in their power to enable the industry, particularly in theinterests of exports, to develop where appropriate the higher grades ofproduction and higher quality lines.    The operation of the &quot;D&quot; scheme in the case of the textile industry has a specially frustrating effect on this process.    The industry concerned is being hit with peculiar force by lowcost competition in the lower quality ranges, and depends for its futureon long lines of production in higher quality goods.In these circumstances the Government have taken thedecisions on purchase tax which the Chancellor has just announced.The measures taken to safeguard the industry against further increases in duty-free imports of cotton grey cloth for the home marketpending discussions with the Commonwealth, coupled with the announce-ment by the Chancellor, should enable the industry to concentrate uponthe task of pressing forward with its modernisation, re-equipment andre-organisation so as to use to the full the market opportunities which exist.
