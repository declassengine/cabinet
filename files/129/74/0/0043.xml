this document is the property of her britannic  majestvs  government- ...   . Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1955SECRET &quot; Copy No.   ^C. (55) 93:5th April, 1955CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in his memorandum C. (55) 92 the Colonial Secretary has made certain recommendations for our future policy on Cyprus. I agree generally with these recommendations. I attempt below to estimate the probable repercussions in greece, at the United Nations and in Turkey should these recommendations becarried out.Greece2. In spite of the rebuff which they received at the last session of the general assembly, the Greek Government have continued their campaign for Enosis.Though their present intention is not certainly known, they may well seek to raisethe Cyprus question again at the next session. Meanwhile, despite our repeatedprotests, the subversive propaganda broadcasts to Cyprus by Athens Radio have continued and have consistently urged Cypriots to oppose the introduction of a constitution. The Greek press campaign against this country has continued in sovirulent a form that I have been obliged to inform the Greek Government that no british Minister or senior representative can go to Greece, e.g., for a North atlantic treaty Organisation ministerial meeting, in present circumstances. There hasmoreover recently been an attempt (not the first of its kind) to smuggleexplosives&quot; &quot;into Cyprus from Greece, of which the Greek Government were almost certainlyaware.3. There have however been signs lately that the Greek Government areuncomfortable in their present position and would welcome a chance to escape from it. Without some face-saving pretext they can hardly do so. Through theirown fault Cyprus has become a prestige issue for them and they are underconsiderable domestic pressure, particularly from the Greek Orthodox Church, tocontinue their campaign. A statement on the lines proposed by the colonial secretary, contemplating self-determination as a possible ultimate goal to bereached through constitutional processes, would give the Greek Government theopportunity to withdraw their opposition to a constitution for Cyprus, and tacitlyto drop the campaign for Enosis. H.M. Ambassador at Athens considers that thepresent is a good time at which to make a statement of this kind.4. There can be no question in my view of consulting the Greek Governmentin advance about this new policy. To do so would be a sign of weaknessand encourage endless argument. Whether or not we should give them an houror two&apos;s prior warning of our statement is a matter for consideration on which Ipropose to consult H.M. Ambassador at Athens.. The United Nations -      - \ - &apos;.      5.  We were able to defeat the Greeks at the United Nations last year byI    means of a procedural device which enabled other delegations (particularly the[-   United States) to avoid a vote against self-determination. We cannot expect to beable to do this a second time. The Greek case attracted some sympathy because itcould be represented that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were opposed to self-determination for Cyprus.  If at the next session we appeared to have made no47885
advance on our earlier position, the Greeks would almost certainly raise thequestion again and in that event a Greek resolution must be expected to receive amajority. This would stir up further agitation in Greece and in Cyprus itself andwe. would have to expect more serious riots than we had last time, when wedefeated the Greeks in the United Nations. (The example of French North Africawhere rioting follows the annual row in the United Nations, is a warning.) On theother hand, if we can show that we do not exclude the prospect of self-determination for Cyprus, we should be very much better able to defeat any Gieekmove at the next United Nations session; and knowledge of this fact is likely tomake the Greek Government less confident about the results of prosecuting their claim in the United Nations forum. We could also count on a useful impact on american opinion, which attaches, great importance to the principle of self-determination and which, as H.M. Ambassador in Washington has warned us, will find it increasingly difficult to support us as long as we refuse to pay homage to this principle.Turkey6. The Turkish Government are firmly opposed to the cession of Cyprus to greece, and may suspect that the policy proposed might mark the beginning ofour abandonment of the island. While they have no legal right to be consulted,we have an obvious political interest in ensuring that they understand and, at theleast, acquiesce in our Cyprus policy. This means that they must be convincedthat what we are now proposing will not lead to our being stampeded out of the island. The more we can show by our- actions in Cyprus that we are determined to maintain our authority and have no intention of being hustled out, the less will the Turkish Government be alarmed about what we say about the long termpossibility of self-determination. They may, however, seek specific assurances that the rights of the Turkish minority in Cyprus will be safeguarded; we should pay due regard to anything they may say about this.7. I would propose, if the Colonial Secretary&apos;s recommendations are approved, to inform the Turkish Government in strict confidence of the general line we intend to take. 1 should explain our motives on the general lines set out inparagraphs 3 and 5 above. I should emphasise that this does not represent achange of policy, and in particular that we contemplate no change in sovereignty in the foreseeable future; that our purpose is two-fold:  (i) to make possible the growth of self-government in the island (a policy towhich we have always adhered and which we expect to generate in time a vested interest in remaining separate from Greece); and(ii) to strengthen our position internationally, particularly in the united nations and with American public opinion.I should assure the Turkish Government that we intend to stay in Cyprus as longas the world situation makes it necessary for us to do so, and that we will continueto bear very much in mind the interests of the Turkish minority. I would not ask the Turkish Government to agree with our new proposals; but I would seek theiracquiescence in their own interest in order to put an end to a situation which isdisruptive within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and is endangering the balkan Alliance. .&apos;United States Support8. We must do everything possible to ensure that the United StatesGovernment use their influence with the Greek Government to persuade them to drop their Cyprus campaign and in particular to refrain from raising the questionagain at the United Nations. It is most important that the United StatesGovernment should warn the Greek Government that they must count on Americanopposition if, in spite of the more liberal policy announced by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, Greece persists in seeking to make an international issue out of the cyprus question.9. With this in view, I would propose to give the United States government general indication of our proposals shortly before they are announced, and topress them strongly for their support with the Greek Government as soon as ourstatement has been made..&quot; a EForeign Office, S.W. 1, - &apos;   *.4th April, 1955.
