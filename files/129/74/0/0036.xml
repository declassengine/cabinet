&quot;2^L(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos; secret.(55) 86 COPY NO28th Mlarch, 1955CABINETREVIEW OF THE GENERAL AGREEME NTON TARIFFS AND TRADENote by the President of the Board of trade on 24th March the Economic Policy Committee invited meto submit to the Cabinet a statement of policy on the recent review ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (E,A.(55) 11th Meeting,Minute 1).    I attach this.2. I propose that this should be included in a White Paper,giving the text of the revised Agreement in full, which I propose to layon the 6th April.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.I.28th March, 1955.annex the REVIEW OF THE GENERALAGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND.trade on 7th March, 1955, the Contracting Parties to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade completed the comprehensive reviewof the Agreement which they had decided upon at their previous Session.2. Before the review started discussions were held in Londonbetween officials representing all Commonwealth countries.Consultations were also held with representatives of both sides of organised industry.    On the 21st October, the President of the Board ofTrade stated that it was the considered judgment of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the General Agreement was an essential instrument for maintaining order and fair play in international trade j  and that it wouldbe their aim to work for the reaffirmation and, where necessary,strengthening of its provisions, in order that it might play its part in
further progress towards wider trade and payments (House of CommonsOfficial Report, Vol. 531, Col. 1358,).  In addition to providing a forum for the discussion of problems affecting international trade generally,the General Agreement affords valuable safeguards for the export trade of-the United Kingdom in the provisions which it contains for ensuringstability of tariffs and limiting the use of quantitative restrictions on imports.3. The Final Act embodying the proposals for amendment of theGeneral Agreement and for the establishment of an Organisation (to be known as the Organisation for Trade Co-operation) to administer it, andthe texts of certain decisions taken at the Session regarding the futureapplication of the Agreement have already been reproduced in Cmd. 9414.With certain exceptions, the amendments to the existing Agreement will come into force when they have been accepted by two-thirds of the contracting parties.    This Paper sets out as Document A, the text of theGeneral Agreement in the form it will assume when all the proposed amendments have entered into force and repeats, for convenience ofreference, as Documents B to K, the text of the Agreement for theestablishment of the Organisation for Trade Co-operation and the othermain documents^ including the texts of certain waivers, already published in Cmd. 9414.4. The main substantive changes proposed in the GeneralAgreement are those strengthening the procedures of Article XII for consultation regarding the use of quantitative restrictions for balance ofpayments purposes, the additional provisions in Article XVI regardingexport subsidies and the revised provisions of Article XXVIII relatingto the withdrawal or modification of tariff concessions.    A further change is the revision of Article XVIII which establishes conditions and procedures for under-developed countries with low standards of livingto deviate in certain ways from the strict rules of the General agreement in the interest of promoting their economic development.5. The proposed amendments to the General Agreement, togetherwith the proposal for the establishment of an Organisation to administerit, will, in the view of Her JViajestyls Government, appreciably improveand strengthen its value as an instrument for facilitating that expansionof international trade which the United Kingdom, as a country dependentupon exports, has a vital interest to promote.6. At the same time, a greater measure of flexibility has beengiven to some provisions of the Agreement by the negotiation of certainwaivers, the terms of which are immediately effective.    The waiverrelating to the special problems of the Colonies, which recognises thattheir industries can be treated for certain purposes as though they werepart of the United Kingdom and provides procedures for the increase of preferences in certain circumstances, marks an important improvement.The extension of the United Kingdom waiver from Article I, the waiverrelating to the transitional use of quotas for protective purposes and the waiver which permits the United States of America to impose restrictionson imports of agricultural products in certain defined circumstances are all designed to meet special problems of the various ContractingParties.7. In the negotiations leading to these results^, as in the prep-arations for the review, Her Majesty!s Government proceeded in close consultation with other Commonwealth countries, and the United kingdom delegation was throughout assisted by advisers representing the Colonies.
2Uo8D The revised Agreement, though it will include strongerrules relating to the use of export subsidies, will not completely bantheir use, and protection against material injury from the use by othercountries of export subsidies may continue to depend on countervailingduties,,    Article VI of the General Agreement permits countries toimpose countervailing duties, and also anti-dumping duties, subject torules specifying the circumstances and manner in which they may beused, and it is the intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to seek thenecessary legislative powers to enable them to impose countervailingand anti-dumping duties.9. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are fully satisfied that it&apos;is inthe interest of the United Kingdom to reaffirm its adherence to theprinciples and objectives of the General Agreement, and they proposeaccordingly to signify their support for the revised Agreement bysigning, at the appropriate times, the Protocols of Amendments and theagreement on the Organisation for Trade Co-operation.
