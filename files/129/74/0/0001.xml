Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1955SECRET Copy No. g gC. (55)5122nd February, 1955CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Minister of Works &apos;On 16th February I was invited to consider whether a scheme could be devised for erecting a new Colonial Office in Richmond Terrace and leaving theold Westminster Hospital site vacant (C.C. (55) 14th Conclusion, Minute 2).Richmond Terrace2. A plan was prepared before the war by Mr. Curtis Green, R.A., for rebuilding Richmond Terrace, but only the eastern end, which is used by theMetropolitan Police, was built. This was completed in 1940. I attach a mapshowing the site in relation to other buildings (Annexe A) and a sketch of theelevation (Annexe B). No detailed plans exist for the uncompleted part of thework. However, as part of the facade has already been built we cannot make anyradical alteration in the design. As I stated in C. (55) 2,1 estimate that about 1,000people could be accommodated in the new building and that it could be ready in about five years.3. If it is decided to build the Colonial Office in Richmond Terrace and towork towards a Greater Parliament Square a number of decisions must be taken. Public Announcement4. I think we shall have to make an announcement. Little public interesthas been shown in the Colonial Office site for some months, but recently my PressOfficer has had a number of enquiries and there have been speculations about thefuture in some provincial papers. In any case, once we open discussions with the chartered Surveyors (and if we are to stop them putting up a new building inParliament Square discussions cannot be delayed for very long) it is idle to suppose that the news can be kept secret.Westminster Hospital site5. We cannot simply demolish the palisade there is a 12 ft. drop behind it.Iron railings would be unsightly. The best course would be to level the site,protect the underground structure already built and put down grass. Somethingwould also have to be done to hide the backs of the buildings in Great george street, and I think trees are the best hope. I estimate the cost of the work at 50,000. I have already pointed out that I have no power to hold this site exceptfor the purpose of building public offices.   Legislation will be necessary.The Chartered Surveyors6. Before any announcement is made the Chartered Surveyors ought tobe informed. Although they are a well-disposed body, it is unlikely they would be content to stay where they are and wait for the axe to fall. On the contrary theyare likely to argue that their members have long desired to rebuild, that their existing buildings are much too small for their present numbers, that they have a lease of one47699
of the best sites in London with over 900 years to run and that the London CountyCouncil, who are the planning authority, are in favour of rebuilding. They maywell therefore claim that in equity they ought to be bought out at an agreed date and at a price which compensates them for what they are losing. We shall need to be armed with compulsory powers if we are to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. It seems essential that a Greater Parliament Square, likethe present Square, should be vested in and managed by the Government, and I doubt whether existing powers under the Planning Acts are appropriate in such acase.   Specific legislation would therefore be needed.7. Although there is no immediate proposal for rebuilding the MiddlesexGuildhall and offices or the Civil Engineers Institution, similar considerations will arise. In principle it appears desirable to take all the powers we want for a GreaterParliament Square in one Bill. The difficulty is the uncertainty of our plans. Itis unusual and it may not be easy to get authority to acquire property at someindefinite date in the future.8. There are legal, financial and political issues involved which have wideimplications. If my colleagues are disposed to proceed with the idea of a GreaterParliament Square it would I suggest be desirable for a small Committee to examinethe problems involved.conclusions .   My conclusions are:-(1) A scheme could be devised for a new building in Richmond Terrace whichwould accommodate the bulk of the Colonial Office in five years&apos; time.(2) If it is decided to abandon the Westminster Hospital site and work towards a Greater Parliament Square:  (a) a public announcement should be made;(b) the Westminster Hospital site should be made good, at an estimatedcost of  50,000.(c) legislation will be needed:  (i) to enable me to hold the Westminster Hospital site as an open space;(ii) to give effect to the proposal for a Greater Parliament Square;(d) the implications of the scheme for a Greater Parliament Squareshould be examined by a small Committee.N. B.Ministry of Works, S.E. I,22nd February, 1955.
