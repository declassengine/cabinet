Printed for the Cabinet.: April 1955SECRET        &apos; /;, V&apos;- \\ copy No.83G. (55) 92 Z*j. V-&apos;s ..\, \,6th April, 1955  &apos;  1 &apos;     &apos;    &quot; - . .Cyprus memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in C. (54) 245 dated 21st July, 1954, my predecessor and the Minister of state proposed a statement of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy for Cyprus, includingreference to the introduction of a new constitution; and they discussed the probable effects of this on Anglo-Greek and Anglo-Turkish relations, and the handling of the Cyprus question at the United Nations.2.   Two recommendations then approved were that (i) the 1948 offer of a constitution should be withdrawn and a more limitedtype of self-governing institutions be introduced instead as soon aspracticable; and(ii) no statement should be attempted that Her Majesty&apos;s Government might at some date in the future be able to contemplate self-determinationfor Cyprus, but that on the contrary it should be reaffirmed that theycould not contemplate any change in sovereignty.3. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs accordingly made a statement in the House of Commons on 28th July. This gave the broad outline of theproposed constitution as one which would provide for a legislature in whichofficial and nominated members together would form a majority over elected members: some unofficial members of the Legislature would be appointed to theExecutive Council to take charge of Departments. He stated that the Governorhad been instructed to take all action necessary in preparation for the introductionof a new constitution on these lines.4. This initiative has met with little response in Cyprus. Both there and in greece the pressure of the agitation for union with Greece has been maintained and the Governor reports that he has been able to make no progress in introducing the constitution as proposed. He advises, and I accept his advice, that progress can be made if two things are done:  (i) the constitutional proposals are made more &quot;liberal,&quot; to provide for amajority of elected over nominated and official members in theLegislature (in the manner described in paragraph 9 below); and(ii) a statement is made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the effect that theconstitutional step now taken will lead eventually to full internal self-government; and that when that stage has been reached Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment  would   be  prepared   to   discuss  with   the   elected&apos;: &apos;v;i:        representatives of Cyprus the future status of the island.5. The Governor sees no practicable alternative to such a course other than to continue with the present unrepresentative type of Government (the Governoradvised by an Executive Council, containing at present three unofficial Cypriots,a number which might be slightly increased). But he realises also that there is riskin the course proposed of offending the Turkish element. Much would turn onthe precise wording of the proposed statement about ultimate aims for Cyprus. Asuggested text is given in paragraph 12 below.47888
2L1&apos;2.&quot; &apos;-l&apos; Developments since last July6. We were successful last year at the United Nations, but the GreekGovernment show no signs of abandoning their active campaign for Enosis, and% I jhave announced their intention of taking the Cyprus question before the next session;of the General Assembly. The agitation is fundamentally artificial-fomented by the Orthodox Church in Cyprus, with support from Greece,, and withthe Communist Party in Cyprus fishing for trouble but if the situation continuesas at present there is always a risk of disorders including inter-racial conflictsleading to bloodshed, and it may be impossible to avoid prosecution of Orthodoxbishops for sedition. Any such increased tension in Cyprus would afford theGreek Government a new pretext for the United Nations.7. The Governor^ inability to make constitutional progress has been due mainly to the fact that moderate Cypriots still believe that Enosis is &quot; in the air &quot;because of the Greek Government^ pressure and are therefore unwilling to acceptnomination to the type of legislature proposed last July. The Governor reportsthat even co-operative Cypriots hold that a more democratic pattern of constitution is necessary and he believes that he can find a rallying point in a somewhatimproved constitutional offer, provided there is also a statement about the ultimateaims of constitutional development, bolder than anything made hitherto. Hishope is that such a statement would be at least acquiesced in, if not accepted, bythe Greek Government; and that this would lead to a lessening of external pressure on Cypriots.III.Present proposals. I concur in the Governors advice that, although it would be practicable tomaintain order in Cyprus if the attempt was abandoned to introduce a newconstitution, for which Cypriots have shown ho willingness to come forward, thisnegative policy would have strong demerits, both internally and in the internationalfield particularly in the United States. I think that it has little to commend itas regards public opinion in this country. I agree equally with him that Cyprusis not ripe for an almost fully elected legislature on the 1948 pattern. Therewould be too many risks yet, with a people untrained in politics and with the communists the best organised party. I accept his advice that some advance shouldbe made on last year&apos;s proposal; and in the next paragraph I show the differencebetween that proposal and the new one.9. Although the parliamentary statement last July did not give details, andthese have never been published, what the Governor then had in mind was alegislature composed as follows: 3 officials, 15 nominated unofficials, 12 electedGreek-Cypriots, and 3 elected Turkish-Cypriots. This would have provided fora Government majority of 3 over the elected element on all important issues,provided that the nominated members were chosen for readiness to give their support. The Governor^ present proposal is to provide for a narrow majority of elected members. This, could be achieved by the following composition:3 officials and 10 nominated unofficials, with 12 elected Greeks and 3 elected Turks.The advantage of this proposal is that it concedes the principle of a democraticallyelected majority, and should induce more moderates to stand for election. At thesame time the three elected Turks could always be relied on to vote against anyEnotist motions against their interests. Their votes would thus give a majority on such issues to the official and nominated side, provided the nominated unofficial members, or enough of them could also be relied on to support Government policy.The Governor has advised, however, that he does not consider that he shouldimpose any specific provision that nominated members should supportGovernment policy, and it is the advice of his Council that no pledge to this effect should be demanded of persons accepting nomination. I am prepared to accept this advice, because, the success of this constitution depends largely on the governors ability to get 10 suitable persons to accept nomination, and. he is thebest judge of the necessary conditions for this. But.there will remain the risk that,under this hew pattern, sufficient votes might be obtained from elected andnominated Greek-Cypriots to secure a motion favouring early self-determination.If such a motion were passed by the legislature the Greek Government would no
doubt be under the strongest pressure to take it up and, in all probability, to refer it to the United Nations. . I have therefore considered the possibility of anarrangement which would require a two-thirds majority for any motion withconstitutional implications. The Governor has pointed out however that a two-thirds majority would not, given ther.i composition of the legislature, be adequate to prevent any undesirable discussion. He has therefore suggested thatit would be necessary to provide that motions of a constitutional character should require a resolution, passed by three-quarters of the total number of the membersof the legislature before they can be proceeded with. The Governors suggestionsuffers, however, from the disadvantage that any special provision of this kind would rob our proposals of any appeal they may have on grounds of liberality andmight make it impossible to find persons to accept nomination to the legislature.At the same time the effect on the attitude of the Greek Government andon international and &quot; liberal &quot; opinion would clearly be most unfavourable. Theprovision that there could be no discussion of change of sovereignty that was madein the 1948 constitutional offer was strongly denounced in Cyprus, and could infact not have been given force in that form in the constitutional instrumentsbecause of certain of the provisions in the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865. the choice before us, on which I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues,is between these alternatives:  (i) to accept the risks of motions about sdlf-determination and &quot; Enosis &quot; inthe Legislative Assembly;(ii) to embody in the constitution a requirement of a two-thirds majority formotions with constitutional implications (which is still not sufficient toremove all possibility of a successful motion of this character and alsoinvolves the risk of the constitution proving unacceptable to Cypriotopinion); or(iii) to require a three-quarters majority (with proportionately greater risk of failing to secure acceptance of the constitution in Cyprus and the probability of strong criticism elsewhere.10. The proposal for placing more Cypriots on the. Executive Council and giving some (probably 3) the charge of executive Departments remains.. AHmembers of Executive Council would be styled Ministers. I believe that once sucha constitution can be got going, there will be an increasingly vested interest amongstCypriots in making a success of running their own affairs.11. I realise that this change means going back on the part of theparliamentary statement of last. July which announced that there, would be anofficial and nominated majority in the legislature. On the other hand, no details were then given. The House was assured that no irrevocable steps would betaken, and that it was hoped to lay a White Paper when the details of theconstitution were ready.12. The July statement made it clear &quot;once again that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot contemplate a change of sovereignty in Cyprus.&quot; my predecessor added that full self-government with independent self-determination&quot;is a most unlikely thing in any future we can foresee.&quot; He added: &quot;I neverused the term &apos; never&apos;.&quot; I myself said in the House on 28th October: &quot; I havenot attempted to prophesy where constitutional development may ultimately lead.I am not prepared to look into the distant future at a time when we still cannot see clearly the outcome of our fresh step towards constitutional advance.&quot; Tconcede that this gave no great satisfaction to Greek-Cypriots who hope at some 1time to be free to choose their place in the world. The Governor, with the unanimous advice of his Executive Council, advises that the only way of introducing a constitution is by linking it with a bolder statement. I have given much thought1to this, realising that, other things apart, we must not say anything which will lead &apos;our Turkish friends,, inside and outside Cyprus, to believe that we have&quot; sold out&quot;to the Enotists. But I believe that a statement on the following fines would be fully in accord with our general, aims of colonial policy:-   i        :    : 1 &apos;&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given further consideration to their,&apos;plans for political advance in Cyprus and have decided that the newLegislature shall from the first contain a majority of elected members.   an outline of the new proposals is contained in a White Paper published to-day. .This will be a first stage in the closer association of the people of Cyprus withthe administration of the island, and it will, if successful, be followed by further
advances in the same direction, leading finally to full internal self-government,subject to satisfactory safeguards, for minorities. At present it is impossiblefor strategic and political reasons to contemplate a change in the status ofthe island. But once full self-government has been established and proved to be working successfully, the means will exist whereby the Cypriot peoplecan consitutionally be consulted about their future status. When this stage&apos; has been reached and international conditions permit, there is no-reason whyagreement on this matter should not be arrived at between Her; Majesty?sGovernment and the constitutionally elected representatives of the Cypriotpeople.&quot; &apos; - v ;13, The Foreign Secretary, who agrees with the recommendations in this paper, is circulating his own Paper (C. (55) 93), with the recommendations in whichI generally agree, dealing with their probable effects in Greece, in Turkey and atthe United Nations.14. The Governor tells me that the political uncertainty in Cyprus has been increased through irresponsible comment by certain Opposition Members ofParliament who have visited the island. There is a disposition amongst Cypriotsto believe that, by waiting and doing nothing, there might come a different policy towards Enosis in the event of a change of Government in the United Kingdom.It would be helpful if, provided my colleagues approve the policy put forward inthis Paper, the Opposition leaders could be induced to support its general lines in their public statements and refrain from suggestions of an immediate reversion to the 1948 Constitution, or of the holding of a Consultative Assembly in Cyprus.IVCONCLUSIONS15.   I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the following:  (i) that I should make a fresh statement in Parliament on the lines indicated:   in paragraph 12 above;(ii) that a White Paper should be tabled giving brief particulars of theproposed Constitution (details would be worked out later), and sayingalso when it is proposed that the Constitution will be introduced.16. I also request the views of my colleagues on the question (raised in para-graph 9 above) regarding restriction of freedom of discussion of constitutionalmatters by the proposed Legislative Assembly.A.
