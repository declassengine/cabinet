secret.(55) 82    .25th March, 1955QUEMOY AND FORMOSANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate the drafts of three telegrams to Washington in replyto Washington telegram No. 642.    Unless any of my colleagues have any objection or any amendments to suggest I propose to despatch the telegrams as drafted at noon to-morrow.AJB.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.24th March, 1955.SECRET A.To;   Washington.Repeated for information to: United Kingdom Delegation, New York,Moscow, Peking and United Kingdom High Commissioner, Wellington,,Your telegram No. 642   of March 247 Formosa Straits.I have meanwhile received a message from Mr. Dulles throughUnited States Ambassador, the text of which is given in my immediately following telegram.    My second immediately following telegram gives the reply which I should like you to deliver to him.2.        You will see that I still cannot agree to go ahead in the security council at present.    Mr. Dulles has not answered any of the points made in my telegram No. 1034  &quot;of March 12/ and his only reason forwanting to take action now seems to be a desire to use the security council as a forum to put forward the United States point of view.This is not a good enough reason.    Sir R. Scott   H.M. Minister atWashington/&apos; spoke admirably and I fully approve the line he took withMr. Dulles,    I also agree with Sir P. Dixon&apos;s comments in his telegramNo. 253   of March 24/.COPY NO.  fi 8CABINET3.        You should show this exchange of messages to Sir JL, Munro.I know he has been anxious to press on with &quot;Oracle&quot; but I hope you will beable to persuade him that it would be wiser to hold our hand.
SECRETB.To:  WashingtonRepeated for information to:  Moscow, Peking, United Kingdom Delega-tion New York and United Kingdom High Commissioner, Wellington,,My immediately preceding telegram:  Formosa Straits.Message begins:&quot;I am concerned over the fact U. N. Security Council not follow-ing up New Zealand initiative on &quot;Oracle&quot;, which was begun on January 31,and that it has not met on the subject in more than five weeks. Fortunatelythe military situation in Chinese offshore islands has remained quiet.We cannot be sure how long this will continue.&quot;&quot;The U.S.S.R. assumes Presidency of the Security Council for themonth of April.    This will increase the difficulty of pressing ahead with&quot;Oracle&quot; or of having recourse to the Security Council if chinese communists should begin military operations against islands within thatperiod.&quot;In our view it remains as important as ever to keep public attention focused on the fact that we are all for and are pushing forcessation of hostilities in offshore island area.    This is the strength ofour position, and it is ground on which we can all stand united.    If we donot take any further action on &quot;Oracle&quot; we run the risk of having thepublic lose sight of the fact that a Communist aggressive posture is thereal source of the threat to peace in the Formosa area and that we are all bound by the Charter to settle disputes by peaceful methods.    Surelya cease-fire is the essential first step while shots are being exchanged.&quot;For our part we would much prefer to secure a prompt vote onthe New Zealand resolution, even assuming a Soviet veto, in which case it would be perfectly clear who opposes cease-fire proposal.    I appreciateUnited Kingdom reluctance to carry matters this far at present stage.I do, however, feel we can gain benefit from another Security council meeting before the Soviet representative takes the Chair.    At such ameeting the New Zealand representative would introduce a resolution and we would all speak to it so as to emphasize our common desire fora cease-fire and our hope that, if our restraint is matched by Communistshostilities could be avoided.    We would not put resolution to immediatevote if the United Kingdom opposed.&quot;I believe New Zealand would agree to this procedure and I hopeyou will likewise consent so that the U. N. Delegations at New York can make necessary tactical arrangements for meeting before April 10&quot;I have just spoken with Sir Robert Scott and informed him of theforegoing, emphasising that;(A)    I hoped the United Kingdom would realise they would be takingon a heavy responsibility if they were to deny us the right to make our views on this matter known to the rest of the world through security council; and
(B)      I believed it very important that this step be taken within the nextfew days not only because of the pending Soviet Chairmanship of theSecurity Council but also in order that discussion might take place beforethe opening of the Afro-Asian conference, when Chinese Communists will doubtless present their case. &quot;      Ends.SECRET C.To:  WashingtonRepeated for information to: Moscow, Peking, United Kingdom DelegationNew York and United Kingdom High Commissioner, Wellington.My two immediately preceding telegrams:   Formosa Straits.Message begins:&quot;Winthrop Aldrich has given me your message about &quot;Oracle&quot;for which I thank you.&quot;I quite recognise the force of your desire to explain the UnitedStates position before the world and you have every right to do so. ButI do not think that a debate in the Security Council will make the positionany clearer or better from our point of view.&quot;Moreover I see immediate and serious danger if we were topress ahead with &quot;Oracle&quot; in the next few days.    First, attention wouldbe focused on Quemoy and Matsu.    If the Nationalists were prepared tooffer to abandon these islands once a cease-fire were agreed that would indeed be a new element in the situation.    But as things stand now a move in the Security Council would tend to look simply as though wewere trying to guarantee Chiang&apos;s position in these islands.    This was always a danger in &quot;Oracle&quot; but we could risk it while &quot;Oracle&quot; was onits original basis and there was a chance of the Chinese appearing beforethe Security Council.    As things are, however, there can be no doubtthat public opinion in this country certainly, and I believe in Asia as&apos;well, would not support action that seemed designed to confirmChiang Kai-shek in Quemoy and Matsu.    Thus a further move in theSecurity Council now instead of focusing attention on our desire to havea cease-fire, might simply focus attention on the difference between theUnited States on one hand and other free nations on the other regardingthe coastal islands.&quot;There is a further point which Makins and Scott have already made to you, namely if we were to go ahead and the Russians vetoed theNew Zealand resolution, what action could we then take?    To leavematters at a vetoed resolution would surely weaken the authority of theSecurity Council and there would be demands for further action.    we agreed some time ago that action in the General Assembly might be dangerous, but what other action could be taken in the United Nations ?I do not like the idea of going ahead without a clear understanding of thefollowing steps.&quot;The situation might be different if I thought that &quot;Oracle&quot; could still contribute to restraining the Chinese from hostile action.    But I donot think it can.    Nor does your message suggest that you think it might
do so.    As I read your message your main object in going ahead with&quot;Oracle&quot; would be to put the United States position before the rest of theworld in the hope of increasing support for it.    But as I have already saidabove this is surely possible without a political move in the security council.    I have a fear that the latter, instead of improving our position before the Afro-Asian conference, might worsen it by,alienating the indians, Burmese and others whose views may not be without influence in Peking.    It also seems unlikely to me that Soviet Presidency of theSecurity Council would be an insuperable bar to action in April if it became necessary.&quot; I am sorry to go on disagreeing with you about this question ofthe next move.    I can assure you that I have given it very serious thought and I really do not see that to proceed with &quot;Oracle&quot; at this stage would do any good and it might do much harm to the relations between our twocountries and to our common cause. &quot;     Ends.
