Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1947SECRET l^EESM^SSi copy  W0*CP. (W) 13522nd April, 1947CABINETSUPPLY OF  PAPER  FOR  ACTION  &quot;.. &apos;Memorandum by the Home Secretary ,;AT their meeting on 13th February (CM. (47) 21st Conclusions, Minute 6)the Cabinet invited the Lord Chancellor and myself to consider what steps could properly be taken to prevent the publication of Action from being resumed.After discussion with the Lord Chancellor and the President of the Board ofTrade I have come to the conclusion that short of fresh legislation specificallydirected to this purpose there is no means of preventing the publication ofAction.   I do not recommend legislation.2. Action was not suppressed during the war. It ceased publication ofits own accord in May 1940. The reason given in a message issued to subscriberswas that most of the contributors were then in prison under Defence Regula-tion 18b. Sanctuary Press Limited, the Company which was then publishingAction and is now applying for paper, was the subject of a direction, by the then Home Secretary under Defence Regulation 18aa. The effect of thus wasto make it an offence, while the direction, was in force, to take any part inthe Company&apos;s affairs or to invite other people to support it. Regulation 18aawas revoked on 9th May, 1945, and there is now no such restriction on theCompany&apos;s activities.3. All the war-time Regulations which gave special powers of control overpublications have been revoked.4. The Paper Control Orders which are still in force under Defence Regula-tion 55 prohibit the publication of any periodical (other than a very small one)which was not published before 16th August, 1940, and restrict the paper con-sumption of periodicals which are allowed to appear to 40 per cent, of theamount used before the war. It has been the practice to allow all periodicalspublished before 16th August, 1940, the appropriate percentage of their pi^e-war consumption irrespective of their subject matter. To depart from this practice by withholding supplies from Action would be to abuse the Paper Control Orders,the object of which is merely to conserve paper, for purposes of politicalcensor ship.5. The Lord Chancellor has suggested that the reappearance of action might be prevented by altering the period on which allocations are based tosome period during which Action was not published, e.g., the last six months of1948. The President of the Board of Trade does not consider this suggestionpracticable. He points out that it would mean relating allocations to consump-tion in a period which was in itself related to pre-war, and would exclude pre-warperiodicals which have not yet restarted but which there is no reason to ban.The President considers that if any period other than that at present in usewere adopted, it would be necessary to make special rules for periodicals whichrecommenced during or since the selected period. This would create a consider-ame number of exceptions and would lead into precisely that field of censorshipwhich we are seeking to avoid. Further, it would make it much more difficult,u not impossible, to defend the rule, which is necessary in view of the supply position, that the publication of new periodicals of substantial size cannot be[33496]
6. I have considered whether it would be possible to forbid the publicationof Action under Defence Regulation 55 itself. In an acute shortage of paper itmight possibly be justifiable to prohibit certain classes of publications on theground that if they are published, there will not be sufficient paper availablefor other publications which are regarded as &quot;essential to the well-being ofthe community,&quot; but I consider it impossible both from a legal and from apolitical point of view to use this power for the purpose of singling out aparticular publication or of suppressing publications advocating a particularpolitical doctrine.7. I am, therefore, driven to the conclusion that there is no way to preventthe publication of Action except by introducing legislation for this specificpurpose. Since it is useless to legislate in respect of a particular named publica-tion, because other publications may replace it, and since it is impossible to define&quot; Fascist,&quot; or to leave it to the Courts to decide whether any particular publica-tion is Fascist, the only practicable course would be to empower the HomeSecretary to suppress publications which he considered to be Fascist. To givea Minister such a power would be entirely irreconcilable with the freedom ofthe press, and, in the long run, could only do harm. It would antagonise thosewho genuinely care for freedom and would, with justice, be represented to constitute a political censorship.   I do not, therefore, recommend this course.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,22nd April, 1947.
