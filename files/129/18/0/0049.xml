THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 149%th May, 1947CABINETInternational Labour conference recommendation (NO. 74) CONCEENING MINIMUM standards of SOCIAL POLICY IN DEPENDENT TERRITORIES (STJPPLE-MENTARY PROVISIONS)Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution of the Interna-tional Labour Organisation it is necessary to consider what action shall betaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with Recommendation No. 74adopted by the 27th Session of the International Labour Conference. The english and French texts of the Recommendation were presented to Parliament in Com-mand Paper No. 6828.2. In general the Recommendation is acceptable and it has been broughtto the attention of the Colonial Governments with a view to their taking appro-priate action upon it. There are, however, certain details including in particular the references to &quot;equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value &quot; which it would not be easy for His Majesty&apos;s Government to apply atthe present time.3. The position is further complicated by the fact that the 30th Sessionof the International Labour Conference, which is to meet at Geneva in June-July, 1947, will be considering a number of the subjects dealt with in the annex to the Recommendation with a view to the adoption of International labour conventions on the subjects in question. If adopted these international regula-tions would supersede in certain respects Recommendation No. 74.4. Any suggestion of postponing action until after the forthcoming Inter-national Labour Conference is open to the objection that by doing so it wouldnot be possible to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation under which Members undertake to bring Conventions orRecommendations before the competent authorities within at the most eighteen months from the close of the Conference at which they were adopted. It isimportant that we should observe these requirements both in view of our positionin the International Labour Organisation and as an example to other countries.5. In the circumstances the proper course would appear to be for a white paper to be submitted to Parliament now, intimating general agreement withthe Recommendation, but stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to defer a final decision on the Recommendation until after the 30th Session of theConference has met and the results of its deliberations are known. I accordinglyask for approval for the issue of a White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed.6.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies concurs in the action proposed.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and national Service, S.W. 1,%th May, 1947.[33574]
