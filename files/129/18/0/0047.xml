P. (1+7) 1kk)*Strategic Importance of Ceylon2. The maintenance of the security of our sea and air communications is one of the basic requirements of Commonwealth,strategy.;Ceylon derives its importance from the commandingposition it occupies in relation to our sea and air communications in the Indian Ocean.      In any future war we should require touse Ceylon as a base from which to defend these communications.The Island forms an essential link in our cable and wireless network to Australia and the Par East.      It is also thecentre of our Naval intelligence organisations for countriesbordering the Indian Ocean.3. Inability to use Ceylon would deprive us of the only-existing main fleet base between Malta and Singapore and would seriously weaken our control of the  Indian Ocean.       If inaddition we were unable to use ports, and airfields in India,our sea communications in the Indian Ocean and our air routes to Australia and the Par East would be gravely endangered.-Defence Requirements in Ceylonh&apos; In broad terms our defence requirements in Ceylon are:-(a) In peace the right to base naval and air forces in ceylon and to maintain the necessary facilitiesthere: the right to station limited land forces as a nucleus organisation for the defence of the island: the retention- of our cable and wirelessfacilities.(b)In war,   the right to develop the above facilities.
Ajoi 11t y to obtain our&apos;defenca requirements.5. The Secretary of&apos; State for the Colonies proposes thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should make an immediate announcement&apos;granting full independence wi thin the British Commonwealth,instead of requiring her, \as contemplated in the White paper of 19b/5,  to achieve Dominion status by a process of evolution,during which period defence matters would be reserved to theGovernment.In return for this grant of independence the Secretaryof State for the Colonies hopes that Ceylon would be willingto negotiate special agreements with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor safeguards in respect of Commonwealth defence and external affairs.      The  grant of independence would,   however, be madeunconditional and before these special agreements had been drawn up.6. It is clear,   therefore,  that the issue of independencefor Ceylon has got to be faced sooner or later - eitherimmediately if the latest proposal is adopted,  or at some future date if the policy in the White Paper of 19U-5 is adopted.      in either case it  is vital to the security of the Commonwealththat we should obtain our defence requirements in Ceylon by-some form of reservation or agreement.7. The immediate grant of unconditional independence is admittedly a gamble on the good faith of the leader of the moderate Party and on his chances of being returned to  power.I In view of the magnitude of the issues at stake,   and withI experience of the Egyptian negotiations fresh in our minds,I we are convinced that from the military point of view this risk:I is unacceptable.Conc1us ion!8. We conclude,  therefore,  that the grant of independence to Ceylon, whether now or later,  must be accompanied byreservations which will ensure that our defence requirements will be adequately and. permanently met.TEDDERJ.H.D.
