(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET---------CP. (47)  140 COPY NO.        &apos;&apos;\CABINET   :THE SUBMISSION OF THE PALESTINE QUESTION TO THESPECIAL SESSION (OF THE UNITED &quot;NATIONS ASSEMBLY&quot;Memorandum By the. Minister of state the Permanent British Representative to the united nations Organisation is on. the point of presenting the Palestinequestion formally to the Special Assembly which opened onApril 28th.      It is necessary to send Sir Alexander Cadoganurgent final instructions  as to whether,   and if so in whatterms,  he should make a statement binding His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in advance to accept the recommendations of theAss embly.,2. There has been already adverse comment in theAmerican press and  in Zionist circles at the allegedunwillingness  of His Majesty&apos;s Government to declare in advance that they will accept the Assembly&apos;s recommendations, anaSir Alexander Cadogan has warned us that we must expectsimilar   comment from the  other Delegations to the SpecialAssembly.      His Majesty&apos;s Government hove given no suchindication in any official pronouncement.3. The difficulty is that, while it  is naturally our intention to be guided by the Assembly&apos;s recommendations, weare reluctant  to bind ourselves in advance to the acceptanceof recommendations which would be manifestly unworkable orpolitically undesirable.      An attempt has been made to draftvarious formulae which would safeguard our position and at thesame time remove suspicions as to our &quot;good faith&quot;.      It is,of course,  necessary in any case to reserve our right torefuse to enforce a policy, recommended, by the Assembly but of which we dis;approve.4. The formula that would best meet  the needs in New Yorkruns as follows:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the general assembly of the United Nations  to make recommendationsconcerning the future government of Palestine.These recommendations,  if carried by a two-thirds majority in accordance with Article 18 of the Charter,w ill b e a d o p t e d b y H i s M a j e s t y&apos; s G o v e r rime nt.His Majesty&apos;s Government must,  however,  reserve their position with regard to themselves enforcingany policy which the General Assembly may recommend.&quot;5. Such a statement would commit His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto accepting,  for example,  a recommendation by the Assembly
that the administration of Palestine should he entrusted toanother Power  or group of Powers,  or,  alternatively,  that a jewish State should be established covering the whole ofPalestine.      It may be unlikely that the Assembly would makeeither of these recommendations, but acceptance of them might seriously prejudice our position in the Middle East and ourrelations with, the Arab States.       Sir Alexander Cadogan,however,  has expressed the view that anything less than theformula&apos;in paragraph 4 above will&apos; antagonise other delegationsand local public opinion.6. &apos; It  is proposed,  therefore,  that no such declaration,&quot;should be made by Sir Alexander Cadogan at an early stage inthe special session of the Assembly, but that it should beheld in reserve for use if our position of not committing ourselves becomes untenable.       (This  is in accordance withthe view- expressed by the Secretary of State in a telegram dated April 1.1th that such a declaration should only be madeat a suitable moment,  which might not occur until discussion at the General Assembly had actually begun,  and that therewas certainly no need to volunteer it at the outset. ) .7. A less categorical formula runs as follows:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have invited the assembly to consider  this problem,  and the Assembly mustitself be the sole judge of its own recoremendat ions.His Majesty!s Government would therefore regard itas quite inappropriate that they should themselvesmake any suggestion to the Assembly as to the form which its recommendations should take, and they donot propose to do so.      They will confine themselvesto -placing at the disposal of the Assembly all theinformation which it requires,  and facilitating its consideration of the problem to the fullest possible extent.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have brought this problem &quot;before the Assembly in the confident hopethat the Assembly will succeed in recommending apracticab1e and  just solution, w hich w ill teaccepted by all the Parties concerned,  and will thus&quot;provide a basis for the final settlement of thisdiff ic ult prohlem. &quot;8* This formula was approved by the Secretary of Statesubject  to the views of Sir Alexander Cadogan;    but  thelatter sees objection to it.      The arguments in favour ofthis formula and Sir Alexander Cadogands comments on it are set out  in telegram No.   897 from the Foreign Office to Moscow(Annex I) and  in telegram No.   1253 from New York, to theForeign Office (Annex II).       (The reference in the opening-sentence of the Foreign Office telegram is to an earlier draft declaration now  dropped. )941 TTotw the tending Sir Alexander Gadogan&apos;s views,  Istill feel (a)  that it would be preferable not  to make astatement finally committing His&quot;Majesty&apos;s Government, butthat (b) proceedings in the special Assembly may develop insuch a way that it may not in fact be possible to defer sucha statement until the General Assembly meets&apos; in September asthe Secretary of State originally suggested.      I therefore propose,- for the consideration of the Cabinet,  that sir Alexander Cadogan should be instructed to make,  in thefirst instance,  the statement set out in paragraph 7 above,omitting the last sentence or re-wording it at his discretion,
&quot;but that he should he given authority in case of necessitypreferably after reference to the Foreign Office, to makestatement on the lines of the formula in paragraph 4 aboveat what he considers the most necessary moment.H.   Me IT.Foreign Office,  S.W.1,28th April,  1947.
COPY OF TELEGRAM NO.   897 OF  25RD APRIL,   1947,FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOW, &quot;REPEATED TO^NEW YORK AND WASHINGTONYour1 telegram No.   877.Following for Secretary of State from Sir OrmeSargent.We have &quot;been reconsidering the terms of the draft statement on the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to united Nations recommendations on Palestine,   in the light  ofour new proposal that it should he made in the Assemblyitself by Sir A.  Cahogan;    and we have now reached theconclusion that there are important objections to the present draft.2. In the first place, the Assembly would probablyresent  the limitation on its freedom of decision which itwould detect in the suggestion that  Its recommendations should conform to one of three given patterns.      It may be true infact that all possible solutions of the Palestine problemmust fall more or  less under one of these three headings.Nevertheless the Assembly would suspect us of attempting to restrict  its discussion.3. For a similar-reason it seems probable that thestatement would not -put an end to suspicions of our intentions, but might rather stimulate  them.      By apparentlyundertaking to accept Assembly&apos;s decision only if the latterchooses one of the three courses we specify, we give theimpression that while prepared to accept any decision givenagainst either the Jews or the Arabs, we wish to avoidcommitment to accept a decision given against ourselves.4. We are also apprehensive of the effect which thestatement might have on the Arab delegations,  in view of thefact that one of the solutions which it would expresslycommit us to accepting is the establishment of a Jewish state in the whole of Palestine.      This is a solution which HisMajesty&apos;s Government themselves have never contemplated.It may not be recommended by the Assembly, and to mention itin our statement as a possibility that we would accept wouldseem to be giving offence gratuitously to the Arab States ona major issue.       It is to be noted that the Chiefs of staff have recently urged that &quot;nothing should be allowed tointerfere.with the  improvement of our relations with theArab States&quot;.5. If the Assembly.were assured in advance of our acceptance of their verdict as between Arab and Jewish claims,they would be less  inclined to pay attention to such representa-tions on. points of detail as we might wish to make in thecourse of their proceedings.6. The objections in paragraphs 2-4 above couldbe met by a redraft of the proposed statement on thefollowing liness-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the general assembly of the United Nations to make recommendationsANNEX I
91 A1 fconcerning the future government of Palestine.These recommendations,  if carrier] by a two-thirds majority in accordance with Article 18- of the Charter,will be  accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government must, however, reserve their position with regard to themselves enforcing any policy which the General Assembly may recommend&quot;.7. We do not.  however, feel able to recommend thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should enter into so sweeping a commitment at this stage.      Our reasons for this view are contained in our telegram No.  550, paragraphs 1-2.      Thoy-would undoubtedly be supported by the Chiefs of Staff, whohave already raised objection to the present more guardeddraft,  in accordance with the opinion stated in their paperD.O. (47)  23 that &quot; we should retain our essential strategic requirements  in Palestine&quot;.8. We therefore wish to withdraw the proposal in our telegram. Ho.   769,  that the draft statement should be made bySir A.  Cadogan at an early stage in the special session ofthe Assembly,  and to revert to the suggestion in paragraph 3of your telegram No.   709,  that an*y such declaration should beheld in reserve.9. We recognise.that Sir A.  Cadogan will wish to make some comment on the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to therecommendations which they are asking the Assembly to make.We suggest that he might remind the! Assembly that we have asked for redomraenda11 ons concerning the future government ofPalestine and might then continue on the following lines:&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have invited the Assembly toconsider this problem,  and the Assembly must itselfhe the sole  judge of its own reoommendatiens.      HisMajesty&apos;o Government would therefore regard it asquite inappropriate that they should themselves make-any suggestion to the Assembly as to the form which its recomniendRtions should take, &apos; and they do not propose to do so.      They will confine themselves toplacing at the disposal of the Assembly all theinformation which it requires,  and facilitating its consideration of the problem to the fullest possible extent.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have brought this problem before the Assembly in the confident hope thatthe Assembly will -succeed in recommending a practicable and just solution,  which will be accepted by all theParties concerned,   and will thus provide a basis forthe final settlement of this difficult problem.&quot;10. Sir A.  Oadogan might also be authorised,   if pressed to de-fine more clearly the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government before reaching a decision as to their future attitude, mustnaturally await the conclusion of the Assembly&apos;sdeliberations.11. I -should be grateful for an early reply,  as thisquestion should be referred  to the Cabinet  in time for instructions  to be sent  to Sir A.  Cadogan.12.above should welcome Sir A.  Cadogan&apos;s comments on the
ANNEX IICOPY ON TELEGRAM NO.   1355 OP 24TH APRIL,   1947,PROM NEW YORK TO FOREIGN OFPICEYour telegram to Moscow No.   897.Palestine. .^While appreciating force of objections,  in paragraphs to 4 of your telegram under reference,   to draft statement in present form,  I feel hound to recall that we have alreadybeen criticised here for our apparent unwillingness to say we advance that we will accept recommendation of Assembly.I realise that His Majesty&apos;s Government may not be willingto commit themselves absolutely;    but formula in paragraph of your telegram is I think about the least that we could expect delegations and public opinion here to view withsympathy.2. It is as yet too early to estimate reaction toLord Hall&apos;s statement  in House of Lords on April 23rd, butcoming on top of the- Matthev/s story (my telegram No.   1P40)it can I fear only increase suspicions.      Moreover it happensthat I was speaking at Harvard on same day and when similarlypressed I answered basing myself on what I knew of yourintentions that His Majesty&apos;s Government would reserve theright to decide whether they would be bound  to enforce as opposed to accepting any recommendation of the Assembly.(I qualified this by saying that my words were not to betaken textually and that declaration was still underconsideration, in London and not yet formulated).3. I  think therefore that we can certainly expectsomeone in Assembly to ask what our intentions are.      Theywould be justified in so doing, since we have got  the delegations here to  initiate study of Palestine problem andthey may well wish to ask before they go to the trouble of examining the question whether we intend to follow theireventual recommendation.4. My comments on proposed statement in paragraph of your telegram are as follows.      First two sentences seemunobjectionable.      Third sentence however seems otiose and certainly would do nothing to dispel misgivings regarding ourposition&apos; vis-a-vis Assembly recommendation.      As regardsparagraph 10 I should certainly be pressed to define our intentions more clearly but if I only give &quot;wait and see&quot;  asan answer no-one will be satisfied.      Moreover there seemsto he a contradict ion between this paragraph and paragraph 8of your telegram since latter implies that we should holdin reserve a declaration of our readiness to abide byAssembly recommendation subject only to reservation aboutourselves enforcing it.5. I note that it  is opinion of Chiefs of staff that &quot;wo should maintain our essential strategic requirements in Palestine&quot;.      I assume that this is the main reason why
Si 2you do not wish to propose that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould commit themselves absolutely.      I am in some difficultyin commenting on this as I do not know what  these requirements are though I presume that Chiefs of Staff were consulted before decision was taken to refer matter to United Nations,Clearly we cannot explain a refusal to accept Assemblyrecommendation on grounds that it is contrary to our strategic reapirements.Foreign Office please pass Immediate to Moscow as my telegram No.   171.///&quot;Repeated Immediate to Moscow^/
