WENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  KiS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-t ^ nPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1947 A 3?^SECRETCP. (47) 12314:th April, 1947Copy Kfo-,cabinet proposed SCHEME FOR PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF SECTIONS OFTHE  IRON AND  STEEL  industry the Cabinet last considered on 1st August, 1946, the question of what formpublic ownership of the iron and steel industry should take. Approval was thengiven to a proposal that &quot; control of the iron and steel industry should be securedthrough the acquisition by the Government of a controlling interest in the equityof the various companies, and agreed that the Minister of Supply should workout a scheme on these lines in consultation with the Lord President and the-Chancellor&quot; (CM. (46) 76th Conclusion, Minute 3).2. Accordingly, on 12th March, 1937, I submitted a proposed scheme ofpublic ownership for the consideration of the Committee on the socialisation of Industries. The scheme was considered at meetings of the Committee on25th and 27th March, 1947. The Committee approved the scheme in principle and asked that I should bring before the Cabinet at an early date the headsof a Bill designed to give effect to it, so that the Cabinet might take a decisionon the merits of the procedure proposed for effecting socialisation, and on therelative priority in time of legislation on this subject and on the nationalisation of the gas industry. (The Cabinet gave some consideration to this latter question at its meeting on 20th March, 1947, in connection with the provisional plansubmitted by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (47) 79) for the preparation of legislation for the 1947-48 Session, but agreed to defer a decision.)3. I now attach in Appendix I the heads of a Bill designed to give effectto the scheme approved in principle by the Socialisation of Industries Committee.A copy of the paper submitted to the Socialisation of Industries Committee(SI. (M) (47) 13) is attached as Appendix II.4.   The following is a summary of the main features of the scheme:  (a) Proposed scope of public ownershipThe primary objective would be to bring under public ownership the&apos;central core of the iron and steel industry i.e., the production of iron ore,pig iron and steel, together with certain closely-allied processes in there-rolling sections of the industry, including the production of plates, sheetsteel and tinplate.(b) Method of acquisitionPublic ownership would be secured not by the acquisition of selectedphysical assets, which would involve difficult problems of severance as wellas disturbance and delay, but by the compulsory purchase of all the stocks and shares of the companies within the above-mentioned sections of theindustry. In a few special cases (e.g., the Ford Motor Company&apos;s blast furnace) facilities would be left in private ownership to be operated under licence, while a number of small specialist and jobbing concerns in there-rolling sections would not be acquired.Procedure by means of the acquisition of securities would necessarily involved assumption by the State of ownership of all the assets belonging to memorandum by the Minister of Supply[33456]b
the companies concerned and thus of quite substantial interests lying outsidethe field proposed for public ownership (i.e., as in (a) above) and, indeed,outside the iron and steel, industry itself. But in so far as the assetsrepresented by such extraneous interests were physically separable, theycould, if it were thought appropriate, be disposed of at a later date.(c) Retention of company structureIt is contemplated that, at any rate in the initial stages, the form of organisation of the publicly-owned industry should be based on the retentionof the company structure. All the securities would be vested in a central board, appointed by the Minister, which would have complete and effective control over the companies comprising the publicly-owned industry, by reasonboth of its statutory powers and of its ownership of all their securities, andwhich would alone exercise certain functions on behalf of the whole publicly-owned industry e.g., borrowing on capital account. But each company,retaining its identity, would have a considerable degree of freedom inday-to-day management matters.The retention of the company structure would, in my view, secure ,substantial benefits for the socialised industry. Thus service agreements Iand similar commercial arrangements would be maintained.: considerations of goodwill, long-standing commercial reputation, trade names, patent rightsand the like would be safeguarded, while the disturbance attendant ontransfer would be reduced by the maintenance intact of the companies&apos;organisations. Moreover, it would be sound policy to avoid the establishmentof too rigid and all-embracing a monopoly in this field, where individualinitiative and enterprise at the company level should play an important part in maintaining overall efficiency.(d) Future OrganisationRetention of the company structure would in no way preclude theadoption later of wide changes in organisation e.g., by way of the amalga-mation of companies, the winding up of old.companies and the creation ofnew ones, or the establishment, if found practicable, of new functional orother subsidiary authorities under the Central Board. And I should proposeto direct the Board to make one of its first tasks the pruning and reorganisa-tion of the existing boards of directors of the companies.(e) The Central BoardThis Board (which would consist of between five and nine members)wrould be appointed by the Minister, who would be empowered in the legisla-tion to give it both general and. specific directions having regard to the basicimportance of the steel industry in relation to economic, social and defence policy. The Board would have the responsibility of controlling the publicly-owned industry so as to ensure (i) the efficient production of adequate suppliesof iron and steel and their sales at prices best calculated to serve the national interest and (ii) the continuous development of the industry towards greater efficiency and towards the optimum size required by overall national needs,including the desirability of expanding exports.(f) Terms of PurchaseM.j view -which was endorsed when the question was discussed by theCommittee on the Socialisation of Industries is that the only practicalcourse will be to pay holders of securities on the basis of the market value ata selected date or dates of securities quoted on the Stock Exchange and toarrange for a tribunal to asses what such market values would, have been forunquoted securities.If this general basis is endorsed, I would propose to discuss separatelywith the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of what base date or datesshould be taken for this purpose, and other incidental matters which nun-arise in connection with these payment arrangements.5. I think that the draft heads of the Bill will be found largely self-explanatory. I would only say that in this complex field, where we shall becreating a form of organisation which will have no close counterpart in any other major socialisation measure, a statement of the draft heads of the Bill cannot bemade definitive at this stage : it may well happen that as the actual drafting
sof the legislation proceeds it will be found necessary to modify or expand the heads as now given. But I think that Appendix I does, in fact, give a good general idea of the probable form and content of the Bill. I should add that in one or twoinstances I propose to include provisions in the Bill which, from a strictly legalstandpoint, would be unnecessary. For instance, the proposed central board would possess absolute control over the constituent companies by reason of itsshareholdings, and there would, therefore, be no reason to include in the Bill aprovision giving the Board the power to issue instructions to the companies.Nevertheless, despite the fact that I propose to issue a full explanatory white paper simultaneously with the publication of the Bill, I think that it would bedesirable that the legislation should make clear on the face of it that the board will be in a position to issue directions to the companies which must be complied with at once. Accordingly, I propose to insert such a provision (see paragraph 4;in Appendix I).6. I am satisfied that the scheme put forward will give Government fullownership and power over the essential core of the iron and steel industry, andwill at the same time be a practicable measure well suited to the complex circum-stances of that industry. I believe it to be the only way in which public owner-ship in this field can be achieved without a major upheaval, and therefore thatwhich offers the best hope of avoiding very serious interruptions of productionand development.  Accordingly, I ask my colleagues (a) to confirm the conclusion of the Socialisation of Industries Committeethat the socialisation of sections of the iron and steel industry shouldbe effected on the lines proposed;(&amp;) to decide whether legislation incorporating this scheme is to be intro-duced in the 1947-48 Session;(c) if the legislation is to be introduced in the 1947-48 Session, to give saefe */eauthority to arrange for the drafting of the necessary Bill as a matterof urgency.&quot; J.

APPENDIX II[S.I. (M) (^7) 13]12^ March, 1947CABINETCommittee 011 Socialisation o  IndustriesPROPOSED SCHEME FOR PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF SECTIONS OFTHE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum by the Minister of SupplyBackground and Summary1. On 28th May, 1946, the House of Commons accepted a resolutionapproving &quot;the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring forward proposals for transferring to the ownership of the nation appropriate sectionsof the iron and steel industry with a view to its efficient organisation in thepublic interest.&quot; On 1st August. 1946, the Cabinet gave general approval to aproposal &quot; that control of the iron and steel industry should be secured throughthe acquisition by the Government of a controlling interest in the equity of thevarious companies, and agreed that the Minister of Supply should work out ascheme on these lines in consultation with the Lord President and the Chancellor.&quot;(CM. (46) 76th Conclusion.)2. I now submit a scheme of public ownership, for the consideration of mycolleagues, to form the basis of legislation to be introduced early in the 1947-48Session. The essence of this scheme is that, with certain relatively unimportantexceptions, all the companies constituting the central core of the iron and steelindustry 4,e., those engaged in the production of iron ore, pig iron, steel, andre-rolled products, including plates, sheet and tinplate -would be transferred to public ownership by means of the compulsory acquisition of all their securities.These companies would number about 105, although a number of others would come in their train as fully-owned subsidiaries. They employ, perhaps, 200,000workers; the net value of their securities is estimated at about  270-300 million on the basis of stock market quotations at the end of 1946.All the transferred securities would be vested in a statutory central authority,which would supervise the State-owned industry by the exercise of powers derivedlargely from its ownership of these securities and would thus replace (but with much more effective control) both the Iron and Steel Board and the Federation.I contemplate that after transfer the company structure would be maintained.Each company, retaining its identity, would have a considerable degree of freedom in day-to-day management matters, but would be subject to directionon general policy questions by the central authority, which would have certainexclusive powers, e.g., of long-term borrowing.Thus the scheme would have no close counterpart in any other majorsocialisation measure hitherto introduced or under consideration. It has been designed with a view to reducing dislocation and confusion at the time of transfer and ensuring the necessary degree of flexibility in continued commercial manage-ment of the industry. At the same time it will not preclude the adoption later on, if found necessary, of some form of regional or functional organisation underthe central authority. But I do not contemplate the establishment of any suchorganisation at the inception of the scheme.3. In the following paragraphs I comment on some of the main features of the scheme.   It involves a good many complex and difficult issues, but, in order&quot; 33456] c
to keep the length of this paper within reasonable bound, I have deliberatelyomitted, or have severely compressed, many of the arguments and counterarguments which I have had to weigh in&apos; reaching my conclusions. I canif necessary, deal with these at greater length orally.Acquisition and Retention of Companies4. Acquisition of selected companies as they stand will obviate the necessityfor a difficult and prolonged process of selecting and acquiring physical assets,which would involve great complications (e.g., as regards severance and thenecessity for substantial management adjustments) and which would in effect,necessitate the maintenance of enabling powers for a long period. On the otherhand, this procedure involves the disadvantage that the State must take over ailthe assets of the companies, including many lying outside the range of the ironand steel industry proper. Thus there carl be no clearly defined &apos;&apos; horizontal&quot;line between the State-owned industry and industry left in private hands andthe State will find itself the owner of companies in direct commercial competition with privately-owned concerns in the engineering and other fields.5. Nevertheless, I am convinced that acquisition of selected companies, inone operation, is the only feasible procedure open to us, and disadvantages arisingfrom State ownership of assets extraneous to the iron and steel industry can be mitigated subsequently by the sale, where appropriate, of physically separableHill cS.6. The introduction of public ownership by the acquisition of companiesdoes not in itself predetermine the subsequent organisation of the State-ownedindustry. But I am fully convinced that the right form of organisation, at all events in the next few years, will be a &quot; federal &quot;or &quot; holding company &quot; system,whereby the individual companies transferred to public ownership would retain their identity and would continue to function as separate units with a substantial measure of freedom in matters of day-to-day management, subject to general supervision by the central authority, which would also exercise certain centralexecutive functions on behalf of the whole industry. Under this procedure thebenefits of the service contracts, patents and design rights, commercial arrange-merits, standing raw-material contracts and the like would be maintainedunbroken; considerations of long-standing commercial reputation, goodwill,consumers&apos; preference, trade names and the like, so important in highlycompetitive export markets, would be safeguarded; feelings of loyalty to, andpride in, individual companies would be conserved; while the disturbanceattendant on transfer would be sensibly reduced by reason of the maintenanceintact of the companies&apos; organisations. Moreover, I should hope that the retention-tion of the identity and the partial autonomy of individual companies wouldenable the proposed central authority, while securing the benefits and economies of large-scale integration, to ensure at the same time the maintenance of a degreeof competition between the individual units, sufficient to avoid the rigidity and loss of efficiency which might in this industry befall a completely &apos;&apos; streamlined&quot;monopoly.It may be objected that the company structure is to some extent fortuitousand illogical and may not correspond to the real organisational needs of theindustry. - Another criticism may be that the procedure will tend to crystallisethe status quo and to keep &quot; old guard &quot; directors in office irrespective of their efficiency. But I should propose to make it abundantly clear to Parliament thatno passive reproduction of the status quo is contemplated; the proposed centralauthority would have powers enabling it to amalgamate, wind up or reorganisecompanies and to create new companies or new functional authorities. Equally,I should emphasise that one of the first directions which I should issue to thecentral authority would be that they should prune and reorganise as necessaryexisting boards of directors, adding where appropriate directors drawn from the ranks of the workers.Sections of the Industry to be Acquired7. My proposals as to the scope of public ownership are set out at some length in Appendix I; a list of the companies likely to be affected is given inAppendix II.Here it will suffice to say that my primary objective in framing this scheme has been to ensure that the whole of the basic or heavy sections of the industry are transferred to the ownership of the State i.e., those sections concerned with
the production of iron ore, pig iron, and ingot steel (both carbon and alloy) withprimary rolling; save that in a few special cases &apos;(e.g.., the Ford Motor Company-sblast furnace) facilities would be left in private ownership to be operated under licence. It will be seen from paragraph 1 of Appendix I that it is not considered necessary to include in the iron and steel legislation the expropriation of mineral rights in iron ore deposits, since this will be covered in other measures.Beyond the basic or heavy sections of the industry I have thought it rightto place rather narrow limits on the deliberate extension of public ownership intothe finishing field, particularly as I should wish to avoid as far as possibleintruding such ownership into the fields of engineering and shipbuilding. (Itwill be appreciated that the transfer of companies as they stand will inevitably involve in any event the acquisition of substantial interests both in finishingsections of the industry and indeed in other industries.) There are, however,sound economic and technical reasons why certain processes in the re-rollingsections of the industry including production of plates, sheet steel and tin-plate should be integrated as far as possible with basic steel production. i therefore propose that all companies engaged in such processes, except for anumber of small concerns which are mainly jobbers and specialists, should beincluded among those to be transferred.It follows that (except in so far as ownership will be acquired incidentallyby the transfer of companies within the heavy section of the industry) I proposeto exclude from transfer producers of iron and steel castings, crucible steel,tubes, wire, forgings and drop forgings. and wrought iron.Extent of Share Acquisition8. In referring above to the &apos;&apos; transfer to public ownership &apos;&apos; of the selectedcompanies, I mean that all the issued capital of the selected companies shouldbe compulsorily purchased, i.e., not only the ordinary and preference shares, butalso debentures and loan capital. The Cabinet decision of 1st August was toacquire a &quot; controlling interest in the equity.&quot; This would involve the acquisi-tion of at least 75 per cent of the voting capital (three-quarters of the votingcontrol is necessary to secure the adoption of special and extraordinary resolu-tions); and the acquisition of a smaller proportion would not guarantee to theGovernment positive control of the selected companies. On this basis 25 per cent,of the voting capital would be left in private hands, and, while there wouldbe no significant advantages to be obtained by leaving so small a proportion in private ownership, there would, I feel, be decisive disadvantages. e.g., in the eventof the Government wishing to take positive action which might injure theinterests of the minority shareholders. I have concluded, therefore, that I mustrecommend the compulsory acquisition of 100 per cent, of the voting capital.I have been forced to the same conclusion as regards non-voting capital,Le., some preference shares, and debentures. To leave these interests in private ownership would present serious political and practical objections; the ownersmight be able to obstruct the application of Government policy to their particularcompanies, while at. the same time receiving a higher rate of interest on what..in effect, would be Government-guaranteed securities.Compensation9. I have assumed that, as in the case of Transport and Electricity,compensation will take the form of the issue by the central authority of a fixed-interest, tied and dated stock, guaranteed by the Treasury.Settlement of the amount of compensation to be payable raises particularly difficult problems in the iron and steel field, and in consequence we have considered, in consultation with the Treasury, a number of possible solutions.Whatever basis of compensation is adopted must provide for the adequatefulfilment of the undertaking which: I gave in the debate on 27th. May, 1946.that &quot; proper allowance will be made in assessing compensation for the resultsof any expenditure incurred from now onwards in approved schemes for develop-ment&apos; or rehabilitation.&apos;&apos;10. In so far as market prices over a given base period might be regardedas an appropriate basis, there is the difficulty that out of the 245 classes of securities with which the State will have to &quot;deal (involving a total nominalissued capital amounting to some  174-6 million) 107 classes ( 26-3 million)[33456] c 2
are not quoted at all, while 58 classes ( 51-2 million) are quoted but have nofree market. Of the balance, 33 classes ( 11-6 million) are wholly owned byselected companies and would therefore be automatically taken over with theirshares, while 47 ( 85-5 million) are quoted either on the London or provincialstock exchanges and have free markets. Thus the value of many classes of securities to be acquired could not in any event be assessed by reference to market prices but would have to be covered by some other means, e.g., by reference to anindependent tribunal. Moreover, it would be argued that market prices were particularly inappropriate in the case of iron and steel particularly inasmuch as the market could not be said to be as fully informed as in the case of. say,railway or electricity undertakings, while the heterogeneous nature of tlieindustry may make the method particularly inequitable as between company and company. Finally there might be criticism if it were thought that the holders of unquoted securities would be at an advantage in comparison with holders of quoted securities in so far as they would have an opportunity of putting their case fully to an independent tribunal.An alternative arrangement would be to have all compensation assessed byan independent tribunal, but, whatever advantages this might have on the grounds of equity, it would involve formidable practical difficulties and delays. Thecase of each company would have to be argued separately before the tribunal;no common, yardstick could be applied which would shorten the proceedings;while in arguing before the tribunal Government might well find itself placed at a serious disadvantage.A third possible method would be to base compensation on the capitalisationof base period.   This, however, would be open to the objection that the true criterion for present worth is not past profits but future expecta-tions, while in the case of certain sections of the iron and steel industry there havebeen such important developments in very recent years as to make any figuresbased on past experience entirely inapplicable.11. The choice between these alternatives is difficult, and will be the subjectof further consultation with the Treasury. Perhaps my colleagues will agreeto leave this matter for settlement between the Chancellor and myself.Statutory Procedure for Effecting Transfer12. Legislation which provided for the compulsory acquisition of namedcompanies would inevitably be classed as a hybrid bill. I hope, however, thatthis danger could be avoided by the following procedure.I contemplate that the legislation will require every company engaged orowning assets in certain defined activities in the iron and steel industry to register with the Ministry of Supply immediately after the passing of the Act,In respect of any company so registered, the Minister of Supply could within12 months of the Royal Assent either (a) give notice of his intention to acquireits securities, or (&amp;) issue to it a licence to continue in production, within specifiedlimits, under private ownership. In practice, I should hope that notices wouldbe served on the great majority of companies to be acquired within six months or so of the passing of the Act. Most of these companies would have been named in the White Paper which I propose to issue simultaneously with the publicationof the Bill (see paragraph 22 below). A period of six months would be necessaryin any event to enable the central authority to get its organisation properlyestablished.The Central Authority(i) Composition13. Responsibility for the general conduct of the State-owned industry would be assigned to a quasi-independent statutory authority, called hence-forward &quot; the Board.&quot; All the members of this body would be appointed by theMinister. I contemplate that the Board would comprise the Chairman tand.between five and nine members (not all of whom1 need be full-time) : the qualifica-tions governing the selection of its members would be broadly similar to those laid down in the now more or less standard clauses in other socialisation measures.The conditions of appointment (including provisions as to salaries and allow-ances, tenure of office, power to call for resignation) would be fixed by theMinister.
(ii) Relations with the Minister14. I thinik that in the legislation the right should be reserved to theMinister to give both general and special directions to the Board, having regardto the basic importance of the steel industry in relation to economic, social, and defence policy. But I should propose to make it clear in the second readingspeech that, as I contemplate, the power would normally be a residual one only and that the Minister would not be constantly interfering with the Board&apos;conduct of ordinary business. I think, however, that the legislation should require the Board to act on lines settled by the Minister in respect of develop-ment programmes or schemes involving substantial capital outlay, import pro-grammes and any rationing of iron and steel products, and that reference shouldoe made to the Minister in respect of proposals for the liquidation, amalgama-tions, disposals or acquisitions of companies or for the formation of newcompanies.(iii) Responsibilities and Poivers15. In addition to the now more or less standard provisions relating to the safety and welfare of workers, research, and the balancing of its income andexpenditure, the responsibilities of the Board would be defined as : (a) the efficient production of adequate supplies of iron and steel and theirsale at prices best calculated to serve the national interest;(&amp;) the continuous development of the industry towards greater efficiency and towards the optimum size required by overall national needs.In addition, the Board would be responsible for certain central executive functions on behalf of transferred companies, e.g.; the bulk import of rawmaterials and semi-finished steel, and possibly the centralised selling of standardproducts.16. The Board will have to be given powers comparable with those givento similar bodies in other socialisation measures, including power to enter into agreements with other bodies, to establish new companies and to acquireadditional ones by agreement. And although the Board will, in any event, have complete ultimate powers over the transferred companies by reason of the vestingof all their securities in it, I think that, from the standpoint both of convenienceand public presentation, there should be a provision in the legislation to the effectthat the Board may give special or general direction to the boards of the trans-ferred companies and that those boards are to carry out the directions.(iv) Finance17. The arrangements as to finance would follow the general pattern laiddown in recent socialisation measures. The Board would be responsible forservicing the compensation stock and for controlling and for financing from itsreserves, or new capital, the development of the industry. The Board&apos;s income(other than interest on investments) would be derived from profit made by thecompanies under its control. Thus it would be for the Board to require these companies to pay to it each year such share of their profits as it would determine.There would be the usual provisions governing the establishment of a general reserve fund, and the keeping of proper accounts and records. Borrowing to meetthe requirements of the transferred companies would be centralised in the Boardexcept, perhaps, for purely short-term accommodation. But it is contemplated that the companies would be allowed by the Board to retain reserves withinprescribed limits.(v) Relations with the Companies18. I do not wish to burden this paper with detailed discussion of the natureof the Board&apos;s relationship with the individual companies. I have already pointed out that, strictly speaking, it will be unnecessary to incorporate in thelegislation any provisions governing this relationship, since the Board, by virtueof its ownership of all the capital of the transferred companies, will have finalpower over the companies. But Government will certainly be pressed to give an indication of its views as to how, in fact, the new system will be operated, andthese I would suggest could best be developed in the proposed White Paper (seeparagraph 22).
19.   My conclusions are :  (a) It would clearly be wrong for Government to lay down in advance 1doctrines which might run counter to the Board&apos;s experience.   The \,most the Government should do would be to indicate the factors Iinvolved, to show that it had appreciated the importance and difficulty ?of the problem, and to sketch out the sort of arrangements whichmight, in its view, be appropriate for adoption by the Board.(b) The Board (and not the Minister) should be responsible for the appointment of the directors of the companies. I have already referred to my intention to direct the Board to review and prune the existing boards.(c) It is important to give both the boards and the employees of the com-panies, within the framework of the socialised system, incentives to efficiency and effort, since I feel strongly that this is a field whereexperiment and novelty of method would be fully justified and couldwell be made consistent with the attainment of the objectives ofsocialisation.(d) In particular, I am examining in the interests of maintaining individual jefficiency and initiative, the possibility of retaining a degree of com- Ipetition between companies, within the framework of maximum prices [prescribed by the Board, with some limits on the degree to which Icompanies could reduce their prices below economic levels and the ;extent to which they could utilise their reserves in order to maintain \themselves in a competitive struggle. Difficult as the problem is, I !believe that in this field we should be able to achieve a significant and valuable union of the advantages of integration and those of individual -dual initiative and effort.Control of Companies Left in Private Ownership20. Paragraph 7 makes it clear that a number of companies now within the Iambit of control of the present Iron and Steel Board will remain in private ownership. I propose that after the introduction of public ownership these fcompanies should not be subject to any special form of control (other thanlicensing of production in certain particular cases) but should be brought withinthe scope of the supervision exercised by the Ministry of Supply over theengineering industry generally.Procedure before the Introduction of the Legislation .21. I have already invited the Trades Union Congress to arrange for an ad hoc liaison committee to meet with me in order to put forward their viewson issues arising in connection with public ownership. There is also the questionof consultation with the Iron and Steel Federation and anologous bodies suchas the Joint Iron Council. I am anxious not to be open to the charge that theFederation was given no opportunity of expressing its views or of improving the details of the scheme in the light of practical knowledge. I would therefore propose to take a suitable opportunity of confirming to the President andChairman of the Federation that Government is actively engaged upon thepreparation of legislation providing for public ownership in the iron and steelindustry and of inviting them to put forward any considerations (e.g., affectingthe scope and nature of public ownership arrangements) of which, in their view,account should be taken in framing the legislation. But I should, of course, avoiddiscussion with Lhem on certain matters, such as compensation.22. I propose to arrange for the issue, simultaneously with the publicationof the Bill, of a fairly full White Paper explaining the scheme. I am convincedthat this will be essential, since the legislation will necessarily have to be drawn in very general terms and will not itself demonstrate how Government contemplate?that the scheme would in fact be operated. The issue of a White Paper would.I hope, do a good deal to prevent embarrassing misunderstandings from being&apos;formed in the period between the publication of the legislation and the secondreading debate; it would enable Government to show on the one hand that theyhad had due regard to the complexity of the industry and to the desirability ofmaintaining flexibility in matters of technical and commercial management, and.on the other, that they had no intention of perpetuating unchanged the status quo.It would also be possible to state in the White Paper more clearly than would bepossible in the legislation (having regard, in particular, to the necessity of
avoiding hybrid legislation) what companies or groups of companies government proposed to transfer to public ownership. This would obviate criticism- to theeffect that Government was introducing what was virtually an enabling Bill whichwould leave companies in the industry in prolonged suspense and confusion.Conclusion23. I ask my colleagues to approve the drafting of legislation to give effectto a scheme on the lines summarised above. I am satisfied that this scheme,although it will not be free from difficulties inescapable in this complex field, is practicable, defensible and the best suited to the circumstances of the iron andsteel industry. It will, of course, be highly controversial and strenuously opposed by all the forces which the industry and the Opposition can mobilise. It isessential in my view that to meet this we should base ourselves squarely on themain justification for the measure the need for the rapid reorganisation andrationalisation of the industry, the advantage in the pooling and orderedplanning of resources to be derived from unified public ownership, and the undesirability of allowing this industry, which must more and more take on thenature of a monopoly, to remain in private hands.J. W.Ministry of Supply, W.C.,12th March, 1947.APPENDIX I proposed FIELD OF GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIPProduction of Home Iron Ore1. The iron and steel industry is almost the exclusive user of home orewhich normally provides about 50 per cent, (in terms of iron content) of its requirements. In view of its vital importance to iron and steel production, theworking and distribution of home iron ore should be planned to the best nationaladvantage, and the individual working units should, be transferred to theGovernment as part of the scheme. In practice, the bulk of the current workingoperations is directly or indirectly in the hands of iron or steel producingcompanies proposed for transfer, but to secure complete control, the&quot; independent &quot; operating companies (listed in section 1 of Appendix II) shouldalso be acquired. Furthermore, powers should be taken to prevent workings byany other interests except under licence.There remains the question of mineral rights. The State-owned industry should not be in danger of exploitation by the mineral lessors and, it mightbe argued, should not continue to pay royalties; nor should there be any possibility of private landowners frustrating development of ore workings by refusing to grant the necessary rights. It appears, however, unnecessary to dealwith these matters in the iron and steel legislation. The Town and country planning Bill includes provisions intended to secure for the State the benefit ofthe betterment value of land containing minerals and to enable existing royaltiesto be modified. The general effect of these provisions should be to give the Stateadequate protection against possible exploitation by private landowners.The possibility of frustration in development is guarded against by theprovisions of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Acts, 1923 and 1934,under which owners can be compelled to grant working rights, while the Townand Country Planning Bill contains provisions by which land could be reservedfor iron ore development, and could be compulsorily acquired, while undesirabledevelopment could be prevented.In addition, it is understood that a Committee appointed by the Minister of fuel and Power will specially recommend the nationalisation of United Kingdomminerals.It seems, therefore, that control of iron ore rights will be sufficiently covered.Importation of Iron OreImports account for the remaining 50 per cent, (in terms of iron content)of the iron and steel industry&apos;s ore requirements. They are at present arranged
centrally by the British Iron and Steel Federation^ trading company. In thefuture, ore should be imported only by the Board of the State-owned industrythus providing the Board with control over all iron ore supplies; the merchantfirms concerned in the business would not be acquired but might be employed onan agency basis.Ore-Handling at ports the various specially designed ore-handling plants at ports are owned either by (a) iron and steel companies, (b) railway companies, (c) port authorities, or(d) a combination of these interests. Those owned by (a) and (b) will come into public ownership automatically. Those under (c) and (d) will be subject to theTransport Bill under which the Transport Commission will have powers for promoting schemes for development of port facilities.In the circumstances, it is not proposed to acquire plants under (c) and (d)since to do so would give mse to awkward questions of severance and operation;if the facilities remaining with port authorities proved unsatisfactory thereis no reason to suppose that this will be so there is a remedy in the transport bill. The long-term Steel Board, however, might have powers to create ore-handling facilities itself in case this should prove desirable.Pig-iron ProductionThere are about 100 blast furnaces in operation in the United Kingdom.It is proposed that all companies operating them should be acquired although some do not normally produce the types of pig iron used in steel making. Blastfurnaces are, within limits, interchangeable for production of the different typesused for steel, foundry and forge purposes, and the greatest degree of flexibility in planning production should be available to the Board. There may be room for greater standardisation in specifications and for general rationalisation ofproduction. As an exception, the Ford Motor Company would be licensed tocontinue its pig-iron production which is part and parcel of its wide engineeringactivities. The blast furnace companies to be acquired (in addition to the steelproducing companies with blast furnaces) are listed in section 2 of Appendix II.)Steel MakingOn is that State ownership of the heavy ingot steel plants is thegessence of the Governments plan, it is proposed that all heavy carbon and mostalloy steel producers be transferred. The furnaces are to some extent inter-changeable and the maximum flexibility would be achieved under unified owner- fship, while future planning of alloy steel production with strategic considerations in mind (alloy steel is of special significance in armaments production) wouldbe facilitated. Moreover, there appears to be room for some rationalisation inthe production of alloy steel, which is at present made to some thousands ofspecifications. It is not proposed, however, to transfer a number of small alloysteel producers using most of their steel for some finished product, whoseaggregate alloy steel output is no more than about 1 per cent.* of the total united Kingdom output; their steel-making activities would be subject to licence.It is also proposed to exclude companies whose only steel production is forcastings (see paragraph below) and a number of small Sheffield family businessesspecialising in the making of crucible steel, a special quality high carbon steelmade in small quantities, principally for metal-cutting tools; they comprise,rin effect, a craft industry.The heavy steel producing companies which would be taken over are thoselisted in section 3 of Appendix II.Heavy RollingThe rolling of ingots into bloom, billets, slabs and sheet- or tinplate-barsis completely integrated with ingot production, and therefore the State, by taking over heavy steel producing companies, would become the sole producer of &quot; semi-finished &quot; steel.   These companies also produce the bulk of all heavy&quot;sections, beams, joists, heavy plates and railway rails.* Tho percentages of output given in this memorandum are based on production returns for 1the first six months of 1946; they do not necessarily reflect percentages of capacity, of which information is not available.   It is assumed, however, that capacity proportions are broadly itline with the recent output proportions.
Ke-RollingThe re-rolling of &quot; semi-finished &quot; steel into light rails, merchant bars, andso on, is carried on to the extent of about 55 per cent, by the heavy steelmakers.The remainder is spread over some 100 independent producers, some operating on a mass-production scale. Such large-scale re-rolling should, on economicand technical grounds, be integrated with primary rolling, and these independentlarge-scale producers should therefore be taken into public ownership to facilitatesuch integration. The remainder of the 100 producers are mainly specialistsand jobbers working in close contact with their customers. Generally, their production is at a rate of about 10,000 tons a year or less, and it is contemplated that companies with an aggregate output of all re-rolled products (includingsheets or plates) in excess of this figure should be transferred. The provisionalselection is the list in section 4 of Appendix II.There might be objections from the excluded companies that they could notcompete with a huge publicly-owned industry, which, they might argue, wouldbe able to undercut them, either deliberately, or by reason of being financedat a low rate of interest. They might, therefore, claim an option to come intothe State industry on the same terms as companies compulsorily acquired. Togive an option, however, might involve acquisition of companies which wouldhave no proper place in the socialised industry, possibly including inefficientconcerns. It is doubtful if the reasonably efficient specialists or jobbers would seek such an option, and, in general, it is suggested that Government is notobliged to grant companies not selected for transfer an option to be taken into public ownership. If individual companies should represent during the passageof the Bill that they should be included, their claims can be considered on their merits.Sheet-Making&quot;The continuous sheet mills, accounting for about half the United Kingdomsheet output, will be automatically acquired by transfer of the steel companiesowning them. Other sheet mills, accounting for about 33 per cent, of the total output, will be similarly acquired. In addition it is proposed that, in orderto facilitate the maximum integration of sheet-making wuth heavy steel produc-tion, all the remaining producers should be transferred compulsorily to public ownership with the exception of the small-scale independent companies, whichare mainly specialists or jobbers, and of certain other producers whose sheetoutput is incidental to wider operations extending outside the steel industry..Broadly, all companies producing over 10,000 tons a year would be transferred,,the remainder left in private ownership. In all, the publicly-owned production would then amount to some 95 per cent, of the total; the companies provisionallyselected for transfer are listed in section 5 of Appendix II.Plate production the transfer of all heavy steel producers and of re-rollers and sheet-rollerson the lines set out above will automatically involve State ownership of more&apos;than 94 per cent, of the production of heavy and medium steel plates. The few remaining producers are small and, in some cases, use their plate productioninternally; it is not proposed to make any special provision for their compulsorytransfer to public ownership.Tinplate production as a result of the new fully implemented redundancy scheme, the tinplateindustry comprises the modern continuous mills operated by Richard thomas and Baldwins at Ebbw Vale, 32 other works owned by steelmakers (all of whichwill be automatically acquired), and 14 works owned by 10 independent companies which account for about 25 per cent, of the output; with one exception, all theworks are in South Wales.In the Federation^ modernisation proposals, continuous mill capacity willbe brought, up to 20 million boxes. Initially, 15 million boxes will be concentrated in the continuous mills, leaving 5 million (given the demand) to be made byselected old-type plants. The new continuous mills, to be constructed by a new company being set up by a group of South Wales steel and tinplate companies(the new company, incidentally, will acquire some of the existing 14 independent[33456] d
mills), will automatically be taken into public ownership, and the question is whether the remaining &quot;independent&quot; tinplate companies should be compul-compulsorily acquired. There will probably always be room for some special types of production suitable for certain of the older type mills, but not suitable forcontinuous mills. Some of the older mills owned by steelmakers and by indepen-dent companies, however, can be expected to be fighting a losing battle forexistence, and there is a risk of adverse social and economic repercussions inSouth Wales, which might be minimised if all the mills were in Governmentownership. It is accordingly proposed to acquire the &quot; independent&quot; tinpiatecompanies, whose activities, it may be noted, are confined to tinplate production.They are listed in section 6 of Appendix II.Oilier Interests Automatically AcquiredThe preceding paragraphs cover the sections of the iron and steel industryin which it is proposed that the producing companies should be deliberatelyacquired on the lines indicated, but it will be appreciated that all the interests ofthe companies concerned would be acquired and that such a course would involveGovernment ownership of production facilities not only in other sections of theindustry, but also in other industries, ext., production of materials resultingfrom by-products of steel-making, such as fertilisers and tar products; wideactivities in the general engineering and constructional engineering fields; possiblycertain overseas activities, such as iron ore mining; and even in the productionof such finished articles as umbrella frames, steel tennis rackets, and moth balls.(But see para. 5 of the main paper.)Sections to be ExcludedApart from the inevitable acquisition, under a scheme based on the transferof they stand, of interests outside the sections dealt with above, itis not proposed that public ownership should be deliberately extended to thefollowing sections of the iron and steel industry : :Wrought ironProduction of wrought iron has been steadily declining; it is being superseded steel. It is neither a vital section of the iron and. steel industry, nor, in general,are its products of industrial importance.Iron and steel castingsThere are in existence some 2,000 foundries either engaged mainly in jobbingwork or specialising on particular types of castings; they work in close relation-ship with the user industries and, in fact, many of the foundries are integralparts of engineering works. It is. therefore, considered inappropriate, asindicated in the House on the 27th May, 1946, to transfer them to public ownership(apart from the fact that it would add enormously to the complications of thescheme if they were to be acquired).The State-owned industry will, of course, include some foundries (trans-ferred as part of the assets of companies acquired on some other grounds, e.g.,as pig-iron producers) and will, therefore, be able to exercise a continuingbeneficial influence on the foundry industry as a whole; in addition, it will beopen to the central authority to build up-to-date foundries. Moreover, thefoundry industry generally is at present being closely reviewed by the Iron andSteel Board.In view of the fact that producers of steel castings have facilities for steel-making, it is proposed to take powers to control under licence their outside sales of steel, if any.ForgingsThere are two broad classes, viz.. &quot; forgings &quot; and &quot; drop forgings.&quot; About.50 per cent, of the forgings output is carried out by steelmakers and re-rollersselected for transfer, but much of the balance, spread over some 50 firms, is bound up with the engineering industry. Because of this alliance, and the individualnature of the product in many cases, the acquisition of forgemasters outside the :steelmaking and selected re-rolling companies is not recommended. There is a jsub-section of the forgings industry producing tyres, wheels and axles, but except
mills), will automatically be taken into public ownership, and the question is whether the remaining &apos;&apos; independent &apos;&apos; tinplate companies should be compul-compulsorily acquired. There will probably always be room for some special types of production suitable for certain of the older type mills, but not suitable&quot; forcontinuous mills. Some of the older mills owned by steelmakers and by indepen-dent companies, however, can be expected to be fighting a losing battle forexistence, and there is a risk of adverse social and economic repercussions inSouth Wales, which might be minimised if all the mills were in Governmentownership.

Because of this alliance, and the individual jnature of the product in many cases, the acquisition of forgemasters outside the \steelmaking and selected re-rolling companies is not recommended. There is ;i \sub-section of the forgings industry producing tyres, wheels and axles, but except
is199for one company all the works are owned by steelmakers, and will, therefore,automatically be transferred. The excepted company accounts for less than oneper cent, of the total output.In the case of drop forgings only some 12 per cent, of the total output is by companies selected for transfer in other sections of the industry while a further8 per cent, is by the railway companies and Government factories. The balance is spread over about 150 companies, many of which are within the engineering industry. The future of the drop forgers is closely bound up with that industry-the drop forging is often regarded as an engineering product and it is notrecommended that they should be acquired as part of the iron and steel scheme.Tube productionHeavy spun cast-iron and cast-steel pipes will automatically come into public ownership, and the lighter cast iron pipes, such as rain water pipes, are foundryproducts; the main question in this section is, therefore, whether wrought tubeproduction should become part of the publicly owned industry. Within thewrought tube and pipe field, there are two predominant interests, viz., Stewartsand Lloyds (who will be transferred as heavy steel producers) and the TubeInvestment group, and there is an important broad distinction between theirrespective production policies. Stewarts and Lloycls&apos; output of the he avier com-mercial type of tubes (which are appropriate for mass production methods) islinked to steel production in one continuous plant. Tube Investments, Ltd., onthe other hand, have concentrated on linking the production of finished precisiontubes with the tube using industries, and consequently they cover many activitiesbesides steel tube production, e.g., light alloy tubes, electrical appliances,refrigerators, &amp;c. The two companies have an understanding as to their respec-tive ranges of production, and have also inter-locking shareholdings and d irectorates.Broadly, it seems right that, whereas mass production of the commonerqualities of tube should be integrated with steel production, the making of thediverse and specialised tubes, ranging from hypodermic syringe tube to gascylinders, should be closely associated with the user industries.Outside the Stewarts and Lloyds and Tube Investment groups, and dis-regarding one steelmaking company with some small production of tubes, thereare about a dozen independent tube makers, with diverse activities, accounting for some 12 per cent, of the total tube output, some of it is of a jobbing character,but the bulk the simple forming of strip into conduit tube. In several cases steeitube production is linked with tube production from other materials or withfabricating activities.It is not proposed that either Tube Investments or the other independenttube producers should be transferred to public ownership. They do not form part of the basic iron and steel industry but come in its finishing, sections orextend into the engineering industry. Moreover, it would be impossible, withouttechnical and economic detriment, to sever the steel tube production of the TubeInvestments group from its other activities.Fringe sections of the steel industry the only activities which need be mentioned here are wire drawing andthe manufacture of bolts, nuts, screws and rivets. A large number of companies,and the production of finished products (partly based on materials other thansteel), are involved, and it is not considered appropriate to take them into public ownership except in so far as they will be acquired because of their other interests.Raw MaterialsThe industry uses, of course, a variety of materials besides iron ore, but itis not the exclusive user and, in general, the existing or prospective supply position of the materials is such that there seems to be little danger that theState-owned industry could be exploited by the private interests producing and marketing them. There seems to be no case for bringing such interests intostate ownership as part of the steel scheme, simply because they are suppliersto steel makers. To adopt such a principle might lead us into an embarrassinglywide field. It is also contemplated that the long term Board should not be putin the position of being solely responsible for imports of semi-finished sLeei andpig-iron; to do so would enable the Board to provide its plants with absolute[33456] E
protection against foreign competition, and possibly also to penalise independentconsumers. So long as Governmental control over imports is necessary, theimport programmes should be determined by the Ministry of Supply, and, ineffect, the State-owned industry would compete against foreign suppliers withthe aid of such tariff protection as may emerge from the forthcoming interim -tional trade negotiations.MerchantsThe merchanting of scrap and the stocking and sale of finished steel can,it is suggested, remain with privately owned companies employed, on appropriateterms, by the steel companies or the Central Board so long as they can performuseful functions. It will be open to the Board to arrange or develop its ownmerchanting, and any consequent loss of business to the private interests shouldnot be allowed as a basis of a claim for compensation. It is a normal risk of anymerchant that his customers or suppliers may decide on direct purchase or saleof their requirements and products.APPENDIX IICompanies Expected to be Taken into Public Ownership(1) Iron Ore ProducersBeckermet Mining Co., Ltd.Burke (Walter) and Co., Ltd.Burton Ironstone, Ltd.Byfield Ironstone Co., Ltd.Cranford Ironstone Co., Ltd.Crosby Ironstone Co., Ltd.Eastwell Iron Co., Ltd.Frodingham Ironstone Mines, Ltd.Glamorgan Hematite Iron Ore Co.,Ltd.Gray (Thomas E.) and Co., Ltd.The Hodbarrow Mining Co., Ltd.Holditch Mines, Ltd.Holwell Iron Co., Ltd.Irchester Ironstone Co., Ltd.Lincoln Stone Quarries, Ltd.Loddington Ironstone Co., Ltd.Midland Ironstone Co., Ltd.Naylor Benzon and Co., Ltd.Oxfordshire Ironstone Co., Ltd.Pain (James), Ltd.Pitsford Ironstone Co., Ltd.Ullcoats Mining Co., Ltd.Waltham Iron Ore Co., Ltd.(2) Blast Furnace Operators not Pro-ducing SteelBarrow Haematite Steel Co., Ltd.Carron Co.Charcoal Iron Co., Ltd.Clay Cross Co., Ltd.Darwen and Mostyn I ron Co., Ltd.Dixon (William), Ltd.Gjers Mills and Co., Ltd.Goldendale Iron Co., Ltd.Grazebrook (M. and W.), Ltd.Kettering Iron and Coal Co., Ltd.Lilleshall Co., Ltd.Millom and Askam Hematite IronCo., Ltd.(2) Blast Furnace Operators not Pro-ducing Steel &apos;(contd.)New Cransley Iron and Steel Co..Ltd.Pease and Partners, Ltd.Renishaw Iron Co., Ltd.Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Co., Ltd.Stanton Iron Works Co., Ltd.Staveley Coal and Iron Co., Ltd,Wellingboro&apos; Iron Co., Ltd.(3) SteelmakersAllen (Edgar) and Co., Ltd.Andrews Toledo, Ltd.Appleby-Frodingham Steel Co., Ltd.Bairds and Scottish Steel, Ltd.Baker (John) and Bessemer, Ltd.William Beardmore and Co., Ltd.Blaenavon Co., Ltd.Briton Ferry Steel Co., Ltd.Brown Bayley&apos;s Steel Works, Ltd.Brymbo Steel Co., Ltd.Bynea Steel Works, Ltd.Cargo Fleet Iron Co., Ltd.Clyde Alloy Steel Co, Ltd.Colvilles, Ltd.Consett Iron Co, Ltd.Darlington Forge, Ltd.Darwins, Ltd.Dorman, Long and Co..
