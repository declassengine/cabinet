(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T COPY NO. ^29TH MARCH.  1914-7.CABINETUSE OF LIBERTY SHIPS FOR THE IMPORT of essential SUPPLIES TO THE COMBINED ZONES IN germany memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i attach a report   by the Interdepartmental Committeewhich was set up in pursuance of the instructions of theCabinet (CM. (1+7) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 3) to consider thesecurity safeguards which should be imposed in supportingMr. Hoover&apos;s proposals in regard to the use of Liberty ships for the import of essential supplies into the Combined Zones,2. For my part I feel that in deciding upon the safeguards that we should impose, we should take care not tohedge our acceptance of Mr.  Hoover&apos;s offer with so manyconditions as might cause its withdrawal and thus defeat our objective of securing a substantial saving in the cost of meeting Germany&apos;s essential requirements.3&quot; In the light of the foregoing I have the following comments to make on the proposals of the Working Party:-(a)    I do not think; .that we should insist thatthese ships must be operated by non-Germancrews.      Even if we were ourselvesprepared to meet the sterling cost of wages of non-German crews on the basis of adeferred charge,  the Americans would almost certainly regard any securitystipulation of this kind as a thinlyveiled attempt to protect our owncommercial interests.      It would thereforebe harder for them to obtain the necessaryapproval from Congress.     Moreover, fromthe security point of view I do not thinkthat we are running any very great risksif the ships are chartered to an Anglo-American body and operated under their authority.k Annex
(b)    I am doubtful about the wisdom ofstipulating5 as is suggested inparagraph 12.,  that when a balanceof payments in the Zone has been achieved and the ships ape returnedto the   United States Government thereshould be no question of a continuation of the charter or of the acquisition ofthe ships by Germans,&apos;-.      This might betaken by the Americans as an attempt onour part to use the Hoover proposal asa means of restricting their liberty ofaction with regard to the ultimatedisposal of Liberty ships.      Thesecurity position is already adequatelysafeguarded under existing quadripartitedecision.      If this decision werealtered in any way&apos;;  which could only take place with the concurrence of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and it were decided to allow Germany to retain ships&apos;of the Liberty ship type, the provisionsof paragraph 12 would be automaticallysuperseded.t3 . b o h.Control Office for Germany and Austria.,28TH MARCH,  1947
annex report BY INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEEON THE  SECURITY AND COMMERCIAL safeguards which SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN SUPPORTINGMR.&quot; HOOVER&apos;S PROPOSAL&quot; IN REGARD TOTMJ1SE OF LIBERTY SKIPS FOR THE IMPORT of essential SUPPLIES&apos; INTO THE COMBINED ZONES1.     We have been asked by the Cabinet to make recommendations on the nature of the security safeguards which we should propose to the United States Government in supportingMr. Hoover&apos;s suggestion in regard to the use ofjjiberty ships for the Combined Zones.2,      In addition to security safeguards there are certaincommercial considerations of which we have taken account andthese are included in the  recommendations  set out  in thefollowing paragraphs.3&apos;      Operation of Liberty ships the Admiralty feel that,  if security is to be adequatelysafeguarded; the Liberty ships should be manned by non-Germancrews.      These crews, or at least some of them, could probably be made available from the United Kingdom and other allied (non-American) sources and since they would be paid in sterling their employment would not affect the saving of dollar expenditure under the scheme.      If it proved impossibleto find complete non-German crews the deck officers and enginerocra crews at least should be non-German.ii.     We feel bound to point out, however, that the use ofnon-German crews would frustrate the objectives whichMir. Hoover hod in mind.        His proposal was clearlyactuated by the need to save  ohe overall cost of supplying the Combined Zones and although dollars might be saved underthe proposal put forward by the Admiralty, there would be a considerably smaller overall saving to the British and american taxpayers.      If the cost of Allied (non-American)crews were borne by the United Kingdom and treated as adeferred charge in the same way as the proposed charter hireof the Liberty ships, this difficulty might be overcome&quot;.The wages of the crews would, however, have to be met from united Kingdom funds, and although we should still obtain some saving in dollars,  the overall saving involved in theHoover proposal   would largely disappear.      Furthermore, this might be regarded by the Americans as such a variation in theoriginal Hoover proposal that they would be less willing togo on with it.5.      ChartererThe ships should be chartered to an appropriate Anglo-American organisation in the Combined Zones,
il ?7J. hi (j6.      FlagThe ships should be operated either under the flag ofthe Allied Control Authority (this is the flag under whichthe German coastal fleet at present operates)j    alternativelyif quadripartite agreement to this is not forthcoming a newflag should be introduced showing clearly that the ships arebeing operated under the combined responsibility of the twooccupying Powers concerned.7.      If Ministers decide to accept Mr.  Hoover&apos;proposal that the ships should be operated with German crewsgreater care will be needed in regard to the securityprovisions under which the ships are operated, in particularwith regard to:-(a) Management.The ships should so far as possible be managed by the British and Americanshipping companies which have branchshipping offices established in german ports, preferably on a 50-50 basis.If the Americans are unwilling to agreeto British participation we should prefer the ships to be operated by american steamship companies so far aspossible, leaving only a small proportion to be operated by German companies.(b) Selection of crews.The Allied Control Authority should be instructed to take all steps possibleto ensure that in the selection of the crews the Germans do not use the operationof these ships as a means of training andkeeping crews in being, e.g. by signing on different crews for each voyage and by taking on as deck hands engineers and otherskilled classes.      The use of British andAnerican shipping firms as managers forthese ships should go some way to prevent this.8.      Length of charter periodWe suggest that the period of charter should be tied into the period of the United States budgetary appropriations,i.e.  for the period ending 30th June, 19h8.      We shouldstipulate that any arrangement to extend the charter for afurther period of time should be considered in March,  19^-8at the time when the charters of Liberty ships to theUnited Kingdom expire.      If an extension is then acceptedit should be clearly understood that the tonnage  involved should be adjusted to the  requirements which Germany will then have for bulk imports.      Consideration will also haveto be given to the world shipping supply position at thatdate .
9.      Trade in which the ships will be employedThe ships should be confined to the  import of bulkmaterials from North America (including Canada)  to the combined Zones,     As regards return charters they should beavailable on normal commercial terms for bulk exports fromthe Combined Zones to either the United Kingdom or north america,10o    Repairs and MaintenanceWe should make it clear to the Americans that airy heavyrepairs or any service involving dry docking at the end ofany charter period should not be undertaken in German ports0Light repairs can be done in Germany and we should beprepared to see some small increase in light repairfacilities for this purpose011s   Long term security provisionsFinally we must make  it perfectly clear to the americans that the acceptance of this offer in no wayprejudices the present quadripartite decision in regard tothe German ship-building and the operation of a Germanmercantile marine or any subsequent quadripartitediscussions on this point which may arise.12,,    As soon as the charter period is terminate^., and we regard the maximum length of charters under any circumstances to be the time necessary to achieve a balance of payments for the Combined Zones, the ships in question will bereturned to United States ports and no question will ariseeither of a continuation of the charter or of theirac qui sit ion by Ge germany a13 .   Public ityIf the Hoover proposal eventually goes through it shouldbe made absolutely clear both to the British and american public and to the Germans themselves that the purpose of this operation is not for the benefit of the German peace economy,but purely for the purpose of saving United States and united Kingdom budgetary appropriations.
