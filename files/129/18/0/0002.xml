PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT )S E G R E T COPY NO.CP. (47)  102S5TH MARCH,   1947CABINETMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for air and the Secretary for Overseas TradeEarly in 1946 the British Olympic Associationsuggested that the next series of Olympic Games Meetingsshould he held in this country in 1948,  and asked whetherthis would meet with the approval of-His Majesty&apos;s Government,This suggestion was welcomed by the Foreign Secretary,  towhom the approach was made:    and in due course theInternational Olympic Association accepted a formalinvitation issued, according to tradition,  by the lord mayor of London.      The Cabinet were made aware of this atthe time, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum CP. (46) 141;and preliminary arrangements for the holding of the Gamesin this country have since been put in train by the BritishOlympic Association and the Inter-Departmental Committee onCatering, Holiday and Tourist Services.2. We now wish to obtain the Cabinet&apos;s support forthe plan which has been worked out with the British OlympicAssociation for providing accommodation for the competitorsin the Games.If the Games are to be held in this country,  itis essential to our national prestige that they should bea success;    and, as we are committed to holding them here,the Government should give all possible assistance in ensuring their success.      And one of the factors most likely to contribute to the success of the Games is theprovision of satisfactory accommodation for the competitors.Accommodation must be found, for between 4,000 and5,000 competitors and officials within reasonable distance of the Wembley Stadium,  at which the principal ,events willbe held.      Other arrangements are being made to housecompetitors taking part in events outside London (e.g.  rowingand sailing) and for the 500 women competitors.      For the accommodation of the main body of competitors at Wembley,the following arrangements are proposed:-(a)    R.A.F.  Depot, UxbridgeThe Air Ministry are prepared to make the wholeof this depot available for the period of the Games;    but,in order to find room for the numbers  involved,  it will benecessary to build, in 1947 additional barracks and messeswhich would not otherwise have been put in hand,  under theAir Ministry building programme,  until later.      The cost
gof the new building,  and of redecorating and partitioningthe existing premises, will amount to about  675,000;and the labour involved is estimated at 300 men for twelvemonths from 1st May,  1947.      The depot, as  thus reconstructed,will provide for 2,300 of the competitors,  at normal peace-time scales of accommodation.(b) R.A.F.   Station, West DraytonAccommodation for a further 700 competitors canbe provided in this station,  which is not far from theUxbridge Depot.      The Air Ministry are prepared to make this available.      Certain works of partitioning andredecoration will be required at an estimated cost of 25,00^.(c) Convalescent Depot, Richmond ParkThe War Office have undertaken to vacate thisdepot at the end of 1947,  and the Ministry of Works haveagreed that it should be used to accommodate the balanceof the Olympic Games competitors.      It will afford places for 1,300.      Some temporary partitioning and redecorationwill be required at an estimated cost of approximately 20,000.These proposals are acceptable to the BritishOlympic Association.3. If the work at Uxbridge is to be completed intime it is imperative that a very early start should bemade.      &quot;!e therefore seek authority for the issue of thenecessary instructions for the work to be carried outby the Air Ministry at Uxbridge and West Drayton and bythe Ministry of W0rks at the Convalescent Depot, RichmondPark.The Headquarters Building Committee have agreedthat the work at Uxbridge should be accorded W. B.A.priority.      We would,  however, ask our colleagues to take all possible steps  to facilitate the work and to grantany higher priority that may be required to ensure thatit is completed in time.      Both the labour and the materials requirements must be given the highest priority to ensure completion within the short time now available.An allocation of 600 tons of steel is required,  whichcannot be found within the Air Ministry&apos;s allocation.4. We also ask for authority to incur theexpenditure involved.      The  terms on which the accommodationwill be made available to the British Olympic Associationhave still to be considered and we would propose that thismatter should be examined by ofiTicials of the Departmentsconcerned.      The question whether Parliamentary authority will be required through the medium of a supplementary estimate is under discussion with the Treasury,      TheAir Ministry ask that expenditure incurred by them forthis purpose shall not be taken into account in assessing the extent to which they have met the Cabinet&apos;s request for retrenchment in their Defence Estimates for thefinancial year 1947/48 (O. M. (47&apos;)  10th Conclusions,Minute 2)P. J.N-B.H. W.25th March,   .1.947.
