ROPERTY  0F  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY^S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1947SECRETCP. (W) 12211th April, 1947CABINETWHEAT supplies memorandum by the Minister of FoodNOW that we are approaching the period of the year when our wheat stockswill fall to their lowest level, my colleagues will wish to be informed of the positionand to consider my proposals for safeguarding the distribution of flour during these difficult weeks.2. For some weeks I have been expecting a tight supply position for about two weeks at the end of April. This was inevitable because the shipments from canada have never been able to keep pace with our consumption during the winter months. Our total stocks of wheat and flour were expected to fall to about-1 weeks&apos; supply only one day lower than the stocks we held at the end ofJanuary. As our stocks were only estimated to be at this level for a short period had hoped that we would be able to get through, the difficulty without taking any action which would attract publicity.3. Unfortunately we received disappointing news from Canada last week,and it now looks as if our stocks will remain at a low level for six weeks or so.The transport dislocation has had much more serious effects than were anticipatedwhen I was there. It was then thought that in March they would be able to shipabout 250,000 tons of wheat to the United Kingdom the same amount as inFebruary.  Instead, they only shipped 174,000 tons.4. Furthermore, unless our urgent representations are successful, shipmentsin April and May are going to be lower than we expected. The programme as given to us by the Canadian Wheat Board now shows only 274.000 tons of wheat for shipment in April and 282,000 tons for shipment in May. Our present bulkstock position is now estimated as follows : 4 vjeeks      5 weeks      A -weeks      4 weeksending        ending        ending        ending28th March   3rd May    31st May   28th June		Number of weekt	supply		Wheat   ...	4-1	2:5	2 9	3	6Flour	21	2-6	3 * 1	3	&apos; 7Total	6-2	51	6-0	7&apos;	35. Our bulk stocks on 3rd May will stand at 5-1 weeks&apos; supply, which isno lower than has been expected for some time. But the rate of recovery-especially of wheat stocks-is not so rapid as we had expected. At the endof May the stocks will have risen to only 6 weeks&apos; supply, of which less than3 weeks&apos; supply will be in the form of wheat. Instead of having to consideremergency methods of maintaining supplies of wheat to flour mills for a short period of, say, 2 or 3 weeks, it now appears that there may well be some sixawkward weeks ahead of us.6.   We experienced a somewhat similar difficulty at the end of January when our total stocks fell to 5-2 weeks&apos; supply 3-5 weeks&apos; supply of wheat and1-7 weeks&apos; supply of flour.   With those low stocks we maintained flour distribu-tion satisfactorily.   At the end of April we shall have 2-6 weeks&apos; stock of flour[33443]HIS DOCUMENT   ISCopy. No. 2 9
and we should therefore experience less difficulty in maintaining flour distribu-jtion.   However, there may be some difficulties with wheat and it may onlybe with the adoption , of emergency measures that we will be able to ensurethat all the flour mills are kept in full operation throughout this period.   ButL^even if some flour mills have to slow down the rate of milling, our flour stocks Ipare adequate to cover the short-term difficulty, though as a last resort it may)be necessary to distribute some imported flour of 72 per cent, extraction.7.   However, we shall be operating on the minimum margin.   Any unfore-ifseen failure in supply or any increase in consumption may cause a crisis.   The tabove estimates assume that the average weekly off take of flour amounts to I100,000 tons.   This is higher than the full entitlement under bread rationing. \&apos;But during the three weeks ending 29th March consumption reached 106,000 tons [of flour per week.   To some extent this was due to bakers stocking up for the [Easter Holidays.   But there is always the danger that at least part of this tincreased off take will be continued.8.   In these circumstances I do not think it would be prudent to try to Hget through this difficult period without taking some precautionary measures.  I.WMhave therefore considered what temporary devices we could adopt to limit off take, Hand I have reached the conclusion that the only useful action would be to increasethe flour extraction rate to 90 per cent, for a short period.   I would do this not only in order to save wheat, but also in order to discourage the bakers from Iordering flour from their suppliers.   High extraction flour is not popular with.J8the bakers.   It does not keep well, and the bread it produces is darker, so thatbakers will be loath to order it if they know that within a short time 85 percent, extraction flour will once again be available.   I therefore propose that for 1the six weeks beginning 20th April the extraction rate should be increased to \90 per&apos; cent., and that in the announcement I should make it clear that at the pend of that short period we shall return to 85 per cent, extraction.   During Ithis awkward period, therefore,. there will be every discouragement to bakersto reduce their orders from millers.9.   There will, of course, be a slight saving of wheat during the six weeks jRin which this is in operation.   It will amount to 35,000 tons.   Although there 1will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of wheat offals, other cereal [pfeed is available and the animal feeding-stuffs ration will not be affected in foiany way.10. Naturally I am doing my utmost to increase the shipments of wheat Ifrom Canada. I attach (Annex) a copy of a letter which I have sent toMr. McKinnon, the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, who is respon-sible for wheat exports. Two of my grain experts are discussing shipmentswith the Canadian authorities during this week in the hope of increasing the april-May shipments of wheat to the United Kingdom..... S11.   Ihe longer-term implications of this low rate of Canadian shipmentsare probably even more significant than the short-term difficulties. Because 1of the low rate of shipment during the autumn and during the past few months,the Canadians will have to ship an average of 550,000 tons per month in june and July if the contract is to be fulfilled. I am very doubtful indeed whetherthey will be able to do this, and I have therefore urged Mr. McKinnon in the strongest possible terms to increase his shipments in April and May, not onlyin order to help us now but also in order that the balance to be shipped in june and July may be more reasonable. After all the difficulty there has been, aboutthe Canadian contract, we must not allow it to be said that it has broken down.And, of course, if we fail to ship the whole of this year&apos;s quantity by the endof the contract year, the shortfall may only be made good at the expense of nextyear&apos;s contract.12. There is also a new factor which may prove even more serious. Forsome little time now it has been apparent that the Government of India are using their control of some raw materials and food-stuffs as a method of bringing pressure on other food exporters to divert to India food-stuffs destined for&quot; theUnited Kingdom. At this very moment, for instance, the Government of india is threatening to withhold jute supplies from New Zealand unless 5,000 tons of butter and 5,000 tons of tallow destined for the United Kingdom are diverted to India. It now appears that the Government of India are&apos;bringing pressure on the Canadians to divert wheat from the United Kingdom to India.
13. The High Commissioner for Canada paid a special visit to the Ministryof Food on the evening of 3rd April to warn my officials that this pressure wasbeing exerted. While I hope that we may be able to prevent the success of suchblackmailing tactics, there is always the danger that the Canadian Governmentmay succumb to such pressure. If that does happen, our shipments in theimmediate future may be affected. As long as this danger exists I feel that wemust take some precaution. It is a strong additional reason why we should not hesitate to increase the extraction rate at the moment.14. I will not know the outcome of the meetings which are now taking placein Canada for a few days, but I hope to be in a position to give my colleaguesa full oral report when this paper is discussed. It may be that my officials willbe able to secure some improvement. But on the evidence which is available now think we must take the necessary action to safeguard our supplies during april and May. 0Recommendation15. I therefore recommend that the extraction rate of flour should beincreased from 85 per cent, to 90 per cent, for a period of six weeks beoinnins1on 20th April. 5       5J S ministry of Food, S.W. 1,11th A pril, 1947.ANNEXPersonal Cable to Mr. Mackinnon, Minister of Trade and Commerce,Canada, from John Strachey, Minister of FoodMost UrgentWhen I returned from Ottawa I was so satisfied with the assurances whichI had received about the shipments of Canadian wheat under the agreement that I, in turn, felt able to assure my colleagues in the Cabinet that the wholeof the contract quantity for the first year would be shipped on time. You will remember how Mr. Mclver in your presence assured us that there was no questionbut that the full amount would be shipped by the due date, namely, 31st July,1947. Furthermore, in the light of my discussions with you and your colleaguesI was very hopeful that the March shipments of wheat to the United kingdom would be at least as high if not higher than the February shipments. you may imagine, therefore, how disappointed I am at the actual shipments in Marchand how alarmed I am at the programme for April and May shipments.Shipments in March amounted to only 174,000 tons, while the programmes for April and May are 274,000 tons and 282,000 tons respectively. The outcome of shipments on this scale would be so alarming that I must make a personalappeal to you to find some way of improving upon your April and Mayprogrammes.It would be disastrous to the hopes of both our Governments if it had to besaid that the Anglo-Canadian Wheat Agreement had failed in its first year.Yet if I am to be frank with you I must confess that I am growing more andmore doubtful whether you will be able to fulfil your obligations. In the first ten months, August to May, of the contract year you will ship on present estimatesbarely 2,500,000 tons of wheat an average of 250,000 tons per month. Yet ifthe contract is to be fulfilled you will have to ship a further 1,100,000 tons inJune and July an average of 550,000 tons per month. As regards flour, it looksas if only 407,000 tons will have been shipped in the first ten months out of the640,000 tons due under the contract. I think you will agree from these figuresthat there is good reason for my anxieties.While it is important in the long; run from the point of view of Anglo-Canadian relations that the critics of the Wheat Agreement should not beable to rejoice at its failure in the first year, it is even more important to usm the United Kingdom that we should get the wheat on which we depend forour bread ration. There must be no misunderstanding of our position here,and I must make perfectly clear to you the serious effect wdiich the continualdelays in your shipping programme have had on the United Kingdom. We haveneen seriously handicapped by the slow- rate of Canadian shipments throughout
last autumn.   And now the unexpectedly low rate of shipment in March has caused an acute crisis.   At the end of April I estimate that we will have lessthan three weeks&apos; supply of wheat in the United Kingdom.  For a short period Iit might be possible by the adoption of desperate emergency measures to operate;the flour mills with such low stocks and so maintain flour distribution at the&apos;level necessary for the present bread ration.   The risk of such a course wouldbe justified if there was every prospect of a rapid improvement in our stock \level.   But if your present April and May shipping programmes cannot be improved upon our wheat stocks will remain at about the three-week level until jthe end of June.   Action that would be worth while for a two weeks&apos; crisisis impossible if the crisis is to be drawn out over three months.   I dare not take such a risk with the bread supply of this country, and if you cannot improveon your forward programmes I shall have no alternative but to recommend tomy colleagues either an increase in the extraction rate or alternatively the more drastic measure of a reduction in the bread ration, or both.I shall have to take a decision on the short-term crisis by Monday, 14th April.I appeal to you to re-examine your shipping programme and to find some wayof increasing your shipments to the United Kingdom in April and May toabout 350,000 tons per month. Such a rate of shipment would enable me to get through this critical period safely and would help me to convince my colleagues that the Anglo-Canadian Wheat Agreement would be fulfilled in its first year.Please let me know both what you can do in the comine- weeks and what measures you propose to take to see that the contract is fulfilled by 31st Julyin time for me to inform my colleagues in good time before 14th April.
